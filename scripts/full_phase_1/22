Positive 22 pI have 5 tables that can contain a phone field, but I want to have the option for multiple phone numbers for each table.p  pInstead of creating 5 sub tables, it makes more sense to create one, and link it to the other 5 parent tables. But now I am thinking of how to link that table to the other 5.p  pMy first thought was to filter on 2 subjects. A field that stores the name of the linked table, and a generic foreign key that contains the key from one of the five tables. Im still leaning this way.p  pNext is the idea of putting 5 foreign keys into the table, and allowing them to be null. I dislike both the idea of 4 null fields. Not to mention I have the same issue with another table that would link to 11 other tables in a similar manner.p  pThe third is a linking or junction table, again I believe, with 5 nullable foreign keys, but this doesnt seem to do anything more then option 2 with a little more complexity.p  p4th option, Im using an autoincrement field for the primary key for most of my tables. I could switch to a UUID or GUID for these tables. Im already set up to use UUID as primary for security reasons, but was using autoincrement for most tables for performance.p  pA 5th option is something I ran into where an autoincrement field was combined with a table name to create a new character field. Only during creation of the table, so technically isnt a calculated field. But again dont see the benefit of this beyond the first option.p  pIs one of these the best way to go, or is there another option I either missed, or do not understandp

Here is the part of the issue that is confusing mep  p...p  pA movie theatre consists of an identifier, name, address street, city, province, and the total number of screens in the theatre.p  p...p  pA concession stand is a kiosk that sells products in theatres. The database records the type of concession stand either food or souvenir but not both. Products consists of a unique stock keeping unit SKU identifier, the name of the product, the category e.g., candy, souvenir, popcorn, beverage, toy, and the price of the product in CAD. Every concession stand must contain at least one product. Concession stands are located only in theatres, and a theatre can have many concession stands within it.p  p...p  pNow I know that concession stand is a weak entity and it has 2 relationships one with products entity and one with theatre entity. Now both the relationships are going to need to use the type of stand  the primary key of either of the 2 other entities IS from theatre and SKUID from product. p  precodecreate table HasStand     TheatreID integer not null,     type varchar20 not null check type  food or type  souvenir,      primary key TheatreID, type,     foreign key TheatreID references Theatre ID on delete cascade   create table StandSells     ProductID integer not null,     type varchar20 not null check type  food or type  souvenir,       primary key ProductID, type,     foreign key ProductID references Products SKUID on delete cascade  codepre  pIt says that a theatre can have many concession stands i.e. multiple stands that are food andor multiple stands that are souvenir.p  pMy question is How can I find out where was a certain product sold at which theatre I know I can use the product SKUID to find out type of stand and use the  theatreID to find that stand with that type but I have a situation here where a theatre might have 2 food stands so using the SKUID I find out oit is a food type stand and when I use the TheatreID i find out that there are 2 stands that are food type thus hitting a dead end i cant find out which one of them sold that item p  pp.s. I cannot use a unique IDs for the concession stands at all, only type.p  pAny ideap
Positive 22 pIm trying to understand converting ER diagrams into SQL CREATE statements, but I am having a hard time with understanding how participation constraints work. In an ER diagram a participation constrain is represented by a bold line which means that every tuple in the table must appear in the relationship table. If there is a participation constraint and a key constraint total it is possible to fulfil the key constrain.p  pIs there ever a situation in which there is a way to enforce a participation constraint that isnt also a key constraint without using assertions or check constraintsp

Positive 22 pI have been fiddling with generating charts using PHP and SQL data for some time, and have finally found something that I think will work for my project. I have a database called WEATHER with a table called DATA which contains all of the userinput weather data temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speeddirection, etc which I pull using a QUERY via a file called data.php. Here is said file p  precodeltphp con  mysqlconnectfreed,weather,weather  if con    dieCould not connect  . mysqlerror   mysqlselectdbweather, con  result  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM avgtemp  whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresult    echo row[DATEdatetime] . t . row[AVGtemperature] . n   mysqlclosecon gt codepre  pNow, as you can see, what I have done is create views p  precodeSELECT AVGtemperature,DATEdatetime FROM data WHERE datetime BETWEEN 20150101 AND 20150228 GROUP BY WEEKOFYEARdatetime ORDER BY WEEKdatetime ASC codepre  pfor the specific data that Id like to pull, as HighCharts seems unable to query things like AVGtemperature directly. It seems fine, however, to create the views and then reference them accordingly. Now, the problem is, I can only pull two sets of data at at time into the views. If I create a view with more than just two sets of data, the graph refuses to render. I would like to be able to pull all of my data so that I can have all weather data as plot points. If I add more to the above query after AVGtemperature, such as AVGhumidity the graph refuses to render any points, just the background. I believe the problem lies in the following PHP which is used to generate the graph, but could also be some formatting in the above data.php p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt  ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt    lttitlegtUsing Highcharts with PHP and MySQLlttitlegt  ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsjquery1.7.1.min.js gtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript src..jshighcharts.js gtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsthemesgray.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var chart             document.readyfunction                  var options                       chart                          renderTo container,                         defaultSeriesType line,                         marginRight 130,                         marginBottom 25                     ,                     title                          text Temperature,                         x 20 center                     ,                     subtitle                          text ,                         x 20                     ,                     xAxis                          type datetime,                         dateTimeLabelFormats   dont display dummy year                             month e. b,                             year b                         ,                         ,                     yAxis                          title                              text Temperature                         ,                         plotLines [                             value 0,                             width 1,                             color 808080                         ]                     ,                     tooltip                          headerFormat ltbgtseries.nameltbgtltbrgt,                         pointFormat point.xe. b point.y,2f m                     ,                     legend                          layout vertical,                         align right,                         verticalAlign top,                         x 10,                         y 100,                         borderWidth 0                     ,                     series [                         name Count                     ]                                   Load data asynchronously using jQuery.

Positive 22 pUse Casep  pIm building a site where users can search records  with SQL. BUT  they should also be able to save their search and be notified when a new submitted record meets the criteria.p  pIts not a car buying site, but for example The user searches for a 1967 Ford Mustang with a 289 V8 engine, within the 90291 ZIP code. Cant find the right one, but they want to be notified if a matching car is submitted 2 weeks later.p  pSo of course, every time a new car is added to the DB, I can retrieve all the user search queries, and run all of them over all the cars in the DB. But that is not scalable.p  pRather than search the entire car table with every search query every time a new car is submitted, I would like to just check that single car objectarray in memory, with the existing user queries. p  pIm doing this in PHP with Laravel and Eloquent, but I am implementation agnostic and welcome any theoretical approaches.p  pThanks,p  pChrisp

That way, two inexperienced in TDD developers can help each other, discuss what kind of tests to write and make good headway.p  pMy manager, on the other hand, feels that if we introduce two new development practices in the team at once, there is a good chance that both might fail.

Negative 22 pI have a very theoretical question Is there a way to ban the use of some methods, objects etc. inside of my applicationproject map in C, .Net andor Visual Studiop  pTo be more specific Im developing a DMS System where it should never be possible to delete files from an archive. The archived files are just files inside a Windows folder structure.p  pSo, whenever someone tries to perform a System.IO.File.Delete this should be forbidden. Instead I would force to use a custommade FileDeletemethod which always ensures that the file to delete is not a file from inside an archive. This doesnt have to happen automatically. Its ok when there is an errorexception that informs the developer of a banned methodcall.p  pAnother way to implement this could be to observe all calls of System.IO.File.Delete at runtime, catch them and execute my own FileDeletemethod.p  pOf course these are a really theoretical questions but I would just know if there could be a way to implement this.p  pP.S. Im using C with Visual Studio 2005. So it doesnt matter if I can realize this through my programming language or by Visual Studio or by any other way I forgot.p

Negative 22 pThe Django documentation states the following clearlyp  blockquote   pNot every template in contribadmintemplatesadmin may be overridden per app or per model.p blockquote  pIt then lists the ones that can, and codebase.htmlcode, codebasesite.htmlcode and codeindex.htmlcode  the ones Im interested in  are not among those listed. They can be overridden perproject, but not perapp.p  pMy question is is there a way around this that doesnt involve editing the code inside django.contrib.admin Im willing to consider some monkeypatching solutions . I really want my app to have custom versions of those three files inside its codetemplatescode directory, and have each project that uses the app to use those.p  pThe reason Im interested is that Im creating a large, reusable app with a heavily customized admin interface, and perproject overrides of the core templates arent the best solution, since Id have to copy the custom templates to the template directory of each project that the app gets used in. Releasing new versions of the app with new modifications to those core templates would mean recopying everything to the affected projects. Ugh.p  pI understand the reasoning behind the decision to only make a select few templates overridable perapp after all, if overriding them all was possible, which apps overridden admin would take precedencep  pBut in my case, the app will be the centerpiece of several client projects, with other apps in those projects merely being in a supporting role.p  pCSSbased customization of the existing templates only gets you so far, and Im hesitant to rely on JavaScript DOM manipulation solutions unless absolutely necessary.p  pOne solution that comes to mind is to place the custom codebase.htmlcode etc. templates inside appnametemplatesadmin and then symlink them to the projects templates folder. That way any updates to the app will automatically take effect on the project level.p  pSymlinking is probably my method of choice if nothing better is suggested, but Id like to hear if anyone has a nicer solution.p

Negative 22 pOne of my classes has a field which contains a Set. This field is only ever filled in the constructor, and then read by other classes.

Negative 22 pemIts too late to change the question, but more precise would have been to ask Why does clone not allow singletons. A codecopycode method would be more convenient.emp  hr  pIs there any reason why enums in Java cannot be clonedp  pThe manual states that p  blockquote   pThis guarantees that enums are never cloned, which is necessary to preserve their singleton status. p blockquote  pBut returning the instance itself would also preserve its status, and I would be able to handle associated enums the same way as other clonable objects.p  pOne may argue that p  blockquote   pThe general intent [of clone] is that, for any object x, the expression     codex.clone  xcode will be true, [...]p blockquote  pBut for singletons on the contrary I want codex.clone  xcode to be true. If the instance itself would be returned, then the singleton pattern would be transparent to referencing objects.p  pSo why are enums not allowed to be cloned or did they forget to think about singletons and immutables, when codeclonecode was specifiedp

Negative 22 pI am trying to grasp the link between OPC and DCOM.  I have watched all four of the tutorials a hrefhttpwww.opcti.comwhatisOPCcasestudy.aspx relnofollowherea and I think I have a good feeling for what OPC is, but in one of the tutorials the third one 35 seconds in the narrator states that OPC is based on DCOM, but I do not understand how the two are really linked.  My confusion comes from a question my professor posed in which he asked How and where would you deploy OPC instead of DCOM and viceversa.  His question makes it seem like the two are not as linked as my research suggests.  Im not looking for anyone to answer the question my professor asked, I just want to know the relation between OPC and DCOM, then I can figure the rest out.  Specifically I would like to know if 1. One is always based on the other 2. One can always be deployed without the other.p
Negative 22 pI am working on a very typical web application. The main component of the user experience is a widget that a site owner would install on their front page.

Now we are experimenting with Rails, which is fantastic for 1 the front end UI. The question is how to do 2, the back serving of widget information, efficiently.

Negative 22 pThe idea of MVC itself seems clear to me but I have trouble understanding how the concept scales up to multiple views and controllers.p  pIt appears that Cocoa takes the approach of the controller being the switchboard between the model and the view. How would the application be organized and function in case of multiple views If there is a controller associated with every view, would the main application have to keep track of all the controllers it spawns, or each controller would have nested controllers it instantiates, e.g. an application would create a window, the window would create a toolbar etcp  pWhat if the entire application would need to work with the same model, or would you break the models down into smaller ones p  pIt seems like what Im really asking is how you would split a multiwindowview application into its logical blocks while retaining the modular MVC structure.

Negative 22 pSo I have a table of data that is 10,000 lines long.

Rows 610,000s content column simply says null. p  pI have another table in the db that has the content for rows 6,00010,000, with the correct corresponding primary key which would seemingly make it easy to update the 10,000 row table.p  pI have been trying an update query such as the followingp  precodeUPDATE table10,000 SET contentcolumn  SELECT content FROM table6,00010,000 WHERE table10,000.id  table610,000.id codepre  pWhich kind of works, the only problem is that it pulls in the data from the second table just fine, but it replaces the existing content column with null.

Negative 22 pThe documentation is rather poorly written when talking about playing audio in the background.  It gives the impression that all you have to do to continue playing the audio that you are currently playing is to just add a keyvalue pair to the codeinfo.plistcode file and wallah, its magic.p  pHowever, this is not the case.  For instance, if I play an mp3 that is 2 minutes long, obviously the audio is long enough to be able to play after I hit the home button to send my app to the background.  The thing is, even though I have that keyvalue pair in my codeinfo.plistcode file, it pauses the audio and then resumes playing once I switch back to the app.p  pApple states that all frameworks for audio support background and the sound should continue playing up until the point that it ends and then Apple will suspend your app.p  pstrongSo, my question is  What are they doing that I am missingstrong Do I also have to use their new delegates somehow or call the audio on the codeapplicationDidEnterBackgroundcode  To me, that wouldnt make sense since I am not saving state they do for me with fast app switching or really handling anything in the background other than audio which they say is supposed to be handled automagically.p

Negative 22 pIm currently experimenting with rendering a Mandelbrot set and Ive quickly come to realize that it would be useful to not have to recalculate the maximum iteration count for each rendering...on the other hand its a lot of data to keep track of. It seems to me based on my limited experience with RDMSes that a relational database is probably not the way to go because I dont want the performance to be impacted as the data set gets larger. It almost seems like the perfect situation for a hash table, but Ive never used one before and cant seem to work out how to use or manage one in one of the existing web server languages PythonPHPwhatever.p  pTo be a little more explicit the important values to be stored arep  ul liThe strongoriginal real partstrong of a number on the complex planeli liThe strongoriginal imaginary partstrong of a number on the complex planeli liThe number of strongmax iterationsstrongli liThe number of strongcompleted iterationsstrong emnem before max iterations is hit or until the point runs off to infinityli liThe strongfinal real partstrong of a number on the complex plane after emnem iterationsli liThe strongfinal imaginary partstrong of a number on the complex plane after emnem iterationsli ul  pAt any given time, Given the strongoriginal real partstrong, the strongoriginal imaginary partstrong, and the strongmax number of iterationsstrong, Id like to be able to get a result set with the final real and imaginary parts.p  pSo what do you think Is a hash table the way to go Is the problem too complex for mere mortal data structuresp  pAny help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advancep  pstrongEditstrongp  pIll expound on the problem a bit at the kind request of julienaubert.p  pThe goal I have is to allow a user to zoom in on a Mandelbrot set without the calculation delay even if it is through predefined zooms. I also want to be able to do this in a browser that is constantly asking the server for a new data array give the new x and y coordinates and the height and width to be viewed on the complex plane. However, since calculating the pixel color value can be done much more quickly given maxiter, realfinal, and imagfinal, and also since it would be nice to allow the user to adjust color settings, Im going to only be sending the browser the variables enumerated in my post and let the users browser calculate the color.p  pTake a look at thisp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxfF3f relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netxfF3fap  pIf you take a look at the drawMandelbrot function, you can see that the point loops are storing the important values in a variable called dataset. This variable is then used in the drawMandelbrotFromData function where it performs the remaining calculations needed to figure out the color for each pixel.p  pIf you click cleardabrot it replaces the canvas with a white rectangle. If you click refilldabrot, it runs the drawMandelbrotFromData function again...this is done to show you how quickly it can actually render the set if only it didnt have to perform the painful iterative calculations.p  pSo the ultimate goal here is to be able to calculate these values to arbitrary precision, so a user can zoom to any level of the set, have the server figure out if there are any data for those exact points or, preferably, points NEAR those exact points...though Im not sure how this could be done without performing a range query of some sort, and then spit back the information on a pixelbypixel basis. For example...p  ul liA user is using a 300x300 canvas.li liHe zooms to a point where the top left corner is codex  .000001code and codey  .0000231code.li liHis chosen width and height in this frame is codew  .00045code and codeh  .00045codeli ul  pHe would send those numbers off to the server and receive, in turn, an array with 300300 indexes one representing each point, each containing the requisite information to determine the color of each pixel on his canvas. My question here is...what is the best way to store precalculated Mandelbrot data such that a user can input arbitrary x, y, w, and h values and quickly pull back the values of the points on the complex plane in that range.p

Negative 22 pIm currently using the charting within .NET using codeSystem.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.Chartcode. Thus far it seems very powerful, and works great. However, there is a huge problem in terms of how it is autocalculating intervals. I use a lot of codedoublecode values, and in libraries like ZedGraph, it handles this perfectly. It selects minmaxinterval just fine. However, in MS Chart, it may select 206.3334539832 as a minimum, and intervals of a similar decimal precision. Obviously this looks quite ugly.p  pSo, I tried simply making the axis format code0.00code and it works great when it loads the chart. Except when you zoom in, you need greater precision, maybe at 4 decimal places instead of 2. It seems Im either stuck with 9 decimal places all the time, or else a constant fixed number that may break when someone requires greater precision. Id rather it pick up the precision based on the level of zoom currently applied. Libraries like ZedGraph and Dundas which I believe MS is even using tend to pick good values that change as you zoom in and out.p  pIs there any way to have the intervals change precision as the zoom frame changes Its probably some simple property I have set wrong, but its hard to tell with the millions of properties this thing has especially when theres about 14 places that represent the concept of Interval.p

Negative 22 pIm currently developing an additional page to an already existing website. Actually that part isnt really that important  the page performs its own separate functions.p  pAnyway, originally, this page consisted of two pages controlled by one jpdl pageflow. Everything worked correctly, except when referencing the second page. The user would input whatever they liked into the fields and click submit. Everything functioned as expected, except the set methods were never called. Despite reading existing values from the Backing Bean, it the setters were never called. I wrote some Seam tests and discovered that I could craft my own codeFacesRequestcode that would call codesetValuecode on the same EL Expression and it worked fine, which pointed me to something failing on the JSF side.

Negative 22 pIm new, but I read a lot about memory management, and really tried to find the answer myself. It sounds so basic and yet I apparently dont get it. I have a NSMutableArray as property in .hp  precodeproperty nonatomic, retain NSMutableArray documentListArray codepre  pI synthesize it and release it in void dealloc. To populate the array, I have a method  voidupdateRecordList and in therep  precodeself.documentListArray[DocumentDatabase getDocumentListSortedByDate] codepre  pEDITnext linep  precode[[self recordListTableView] reloadData] codepre  pwhere DocumentDatabase is a different class with the class methods getDocumentListSortedByDate and getDocumentList. Here is what is happening in getDocumentListSortedByDatep  precodeNSMutableArray returnArray  [DocumentDatabase getDocumentList] sorting... NSLogarray counti,[returnArray count] returns correct numbers first and second time return returnArray codepre  pand in getDocumentListp  precodeNSMutableArray returnArray  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacityfiles.count] add file data to array... return returnArray codepre  pThis works the first time I call updateRecordList, but after adding a file and calling updateRecordList a second time, it crashes with using NSZombies emem [NSCFNumber dealloc] message sent to deallocated instance 0x7504c90. With a lot of logging I narrowed the problem down to the line above in updateRecordList and it works if I change it top  precodeself.documentListArray[[DocumentDatabase getDocumentListSortedByDate] retain] codepre  pMy conclusion is that the array down in getDocumentList has been autoreleased before it arrives. So my questions arebr 1. Why do I have to retain it there Shouldnt that happen by itself by declaring the property retain  Or, in other words, why is the array autoreleased too early assuming this is what is happeningbr 2. When I assign a new array to self.documentListArray, is the old array automatically released If I try to release it myself before getting a new documentList, it crashes too.p  pThanks in advance for any reply.p  pEDIT Maybe Im an idiot I failed to mention that documentListArray is the data source for an UITableView see the added line on top. I suspect that I am doing something wrong with populating the table view, and the array gets retained... It does however crash on assigning the property, not on reloadData. I go back to study if I use the UITableViewDataSource protocol properly. Thanks to everybody, your answers brought me hopefully on the right track. Will update when solved.p  pEDIT2 It works now without retaining, and I think I understand why I debugged extensively and found that Objects contained in Objects added to the array where nil. Particularly, deep down in encodeWithCoder I did not use self when assigning values. When decoding, those values where nil. Since I changed that, it seems to work. I strongsuspectstrong that not assigning the new array caused the crash, but the TableView which would  read the new arrayeven before I call reloadData. Which would lead back to Davids question of synchroneous access. Thank you all for your help.p

Is this is a smart way of doing what Im doing Basically, for every container I would need typedefs and const overloaded begin and end methods etc. Im curious what would be your way of designing the interface, naming the typedefs etc I guess Im basically worried about the interface and the explosion of methods, and it looks kinda ugly too.p  pMaybe one way of limiting the number of beginend methods would be a templatebased approach using somekind of tags, but Im not sure if thats sensible.p  pThanksp

Negative 22 pIm using NSFileManagers attributesOfItemAtPath to calculate the date a file was last modified in OS X. While this works, in many cases the file modification date doesnt behave as I would have expected it to. For example if I copy a file created in 2009 and paste it into a new directory it retains the created and modified date of the original file.p  pTo put the issue in context, Im monitoring filesystem events using the FSEvents API. This alerts me that a change has occurred at the directory level. To detect which file has changed within that particular directory, I iterate through each file and check its modification date. This works fine for newly created files, but not for files which have been copied from elsewhere on the filesystem.p  pIs there a lowlevel API that I can access for more information on a particular file If not, whats the best way to determine specific filesystem changes on the file levelp

Negative 22 pOkay, very precisely, Ive been tasked with a Magento admin module that doesnt involve layouts, blocks or views. Nothing is ever to be displayed.

Second of all, I dont have a debugging system and my companys to cheap to spend any money on software engineering so I have to cave man debug. So my question is, how on earth do debug my code and get output from Magento without loading a layout and rendering blocks Ive tried to output in the predispatch method and exiting before the predispatch ends and this WORKS, but I would prefer not to do any coding in predispatch.

Negative 22 pMy questions is regarding VSTO .NET development with Outlook.p  pDue to the way .NET event handlers are handled in VSTO, it is necessary to hold a reference to the COM object representing the item for the event handler on the item to be fired. This is done by declaring a class level variable that will keep the reference from being garbage collected.p  pMy addin is handling the BeforeDelete event for the Calender, Contacts, and Tasks.p  pI am worried that keeping Lists of references to all individual items is going to use a lot of Memory for users with large collections of Appointment items, Contacts, and Tasks.p  pMy questions is about the underlying COM object I am keeping a reference to. Does this object hold all of the items details, or is it just a pointer that Outlook uses to load the details from the datastore. For example, when I access the FirstName property of a Contact item, is this loaded directly from memory or is is loaded from Outlooks PST file.p

Negative 22 pWas wondering what the best way to handle an expensive web taskp  pI have an email scheduler that sends a large number of emails at any given hour. Currently the system is getting a list of emails, constructing them, and deploying them. However, this is starting to get very expensive as the list grows.. Is there a way where I can treat this like a producerconsumer multithreaded paradigm p  pI was thinking I could gather all the emails and curl each one the second part of the web task  constructing and deploying the email by passing the address with the curl. However, I do believe that the system must wait for the curls response before continuing So this isnt asynchronous.. p  pWhat would be the best way to do this right now I have a cronjob checking hourly for emails to be delivered, thats fine, but the emails are all constructed and delivered at once, so it can be slow and possibly overlap into the next hour slot  users have a specified time to retrieve so id like it for it to be delivered on time.p  pShould I create a C program to handle these with threads Or can I get away with an easier method.. thanksp

Negative 22 pIm implementing a simple Volleyball game using Box2D in Flash. I need to implement some AI for the CPU player. Lets call him Jack. So Jack needs to predict wheres the ball gonna land after it has been hit by John, the human player. I have the following information p  blockquote   ol   liInitial Linear Velocity both in x amp y direction of the ball when John   hits it.li   liThe initial position of the ball when John hits it. x amp y coordinate   valuesli   liThe value of gravity. li   liThe value of y position of floor wheres the balls gonna fall.  li   liThe angle at which John hits the ball.li   liThe ball follow a projectile trajectory.li   ol blockquote  pSo Jack needs to predict what would be the position x value of the ball when it hits the floor. p  pI think as the ball follows a projectile trajectory the problem might be seen same as that of   firing a cannon ball from some known initial position, known initial velocity with fixed gravity and predicting its landing spot. The y value of landing spot is also known. The air resistance is zero. p  pIs there any kind of mathematical equation which might help to predict the x value of the landing spot I took a look at some projectile equations but most of them take time as a variable. I need to have a solution that doesnt involve this time variable. Any kind of workarounds for this problem would also be appreciated. Thank you p
Negative 22 pI wasnt able to find a question already answered on here that applied to my situation. From my understanding of what this code is doing, it should actually be working but I just dont understand why it isnt. p  pIm reading a list of SKUs from a text file. Each SKU is on its own line.

Ive been testing with 5 SKUs but I have 200 to actually do so it would be nice if I can get this to work.

Negative 22 pI am struggling with a mysterious problem  I only see on my RHEL4 release build.

I have no idea how that is possible, since the currentWindow has a width of 100 and the new one as well.. I tried to hide that black space, by adjusting curveease, but with no good result, you still can notice a black space in between them no matter what. Any ideas Thanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrong By making the animation duration super slow, I noticed that at the beginning and at the end they are perfectly aligned, but in between they are not. By making the animation to be very fast, the space between the two windows are big. Which means there must be something going on with the easing.. This should make the animation go without easing, no Titanium.UI.ANIMATIONCURVELINEAR. But somehow it does not solve the problem.. Have no idea where the easing comes from.p

Negative 22 pI want to build a database of geographical locations and would like to be able to identify locations that fall inside other locations. For example, The Empire State Building is going to have one geocoordinate, but my database would be able to tell me that it falls inside Manhattan, which falls inside New York City, which is in the state of New York and so forth.p  pIve been looking at a hrefhttpwww.openstreetmap.orgOpenStreetMapa which seems to have a pretty decent database but as best I can tell, I would need to create a set of polygon structures representing each region and then detect if a coordinate falls inside a given regions polygon. Is there a better way to do this, or is there a data source where all of this has already been calculatedp

Negative 22 pSpoiler Im fairly confident that the answer is codeNOcode, but thats only after a day of very frustrated debugging. Now I would like to know if that is indeed the case and if so, how I might have known, or if Im just doing something completely wrong.p  pHeres the situation. Im using OpenGL ES 2.0 to render some meshes that I load from various files .obj, .md2, etc.. For the sake of performance and User Experience, I delegate the actual loading of these meshes and their associated textures to a background thread using GCD.p  pPer a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1612index.htmlApplesa a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideWorkingwithOpenGLESContextsWorkingwithOpenGLESContexts.htmlinstructionsa, on each background thread, I create and set a new EAGLContext with the same codeshareGroupcode as the main rendering context. This allows OpenGL objects, like texture and buffer objects, that were created on the background thread to be immediately used by the context on the main thread.p  pThis has been working out splendidly. Now, I recently learned about a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgwikiVertexArrayObjectVertex Array Objectsa as a way to cache the OpenGL state associated with rendering the contents of certain buffers. It looks nice, and reduces the boilerplate state checking and setting code required to render each mesh. On top of it all, Apple also recommends using them in their a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexDataTechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.htmlBest Practices for Working with Vertex Dataa guide.p  pBut I was having serious issues getting the VAOs to work for me at all. Like I do with all loading, I would load the mesh from a file into memory on a background thread, and then generate all associated OpenGL objects. Without fail, the first time I tried to call codeglDrawElementscode using a VAO, the app crashes with codeEXCBADACCESScode. Without the VAO, it renders fine.p  pDebugging codeEXCBADACCESScode is a pain, especially when NSZombies wont help which they obviously wont, but after some time of analyzing captured OpenGL frames, I realized that, while the creation of the VAO on the background thread went fine no codeGLERRORcode, and a nonzero id, when the time came to bind to the VAO on the main thread, I would get a codeGLINVALIDOPERATIONcode, which a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsman4xhtmlglBindVertexArray.xmlthe docsa state will happen when attempting to bind to a nonexistent VAO. And sure enough, when looking at all the objects in the current context at the time of rendering, there isnt a single VAO to be seen, embut all of the VBOs that were generated with the VAO strongAT THE SAME TIMEstrong are presentem. If I load the VAO on the main thread it works fine. Very frustrating. p  pI distilled the loading code to a more atomic formp  precode voidgenerate       glGenVertexArraysOES1, ampvao     glBindVertexArrayOESvao      vbos  mallocsizeofGLuint  4     glGenBuffers4, vbos  codepre  pWhen the above is executed on a background thread, with a valid codeEAGLContextcode with the same codeshareGroupcodeas the main context, the main context will have 4 VBOs, but no VAO. If I execute it on the main thread, with the main context, it will have 4 VBOs, and the VAO. This leads me to the conclusion that there is some weird exception to the objectsharing nature of codeEAGLContextcodes when dealing with VAOs. If that were actually the case, I would have really expected the Apple docs to note that somewhere. Its very inconvenient to have to discover little tidbits like that by hand. Is this the case, or am I missing somethingp

I just dont see the advantages of the urldesignpattern that theyve adopted, except that the CMS designer doesnt know any better.p  pHow is their current system any faster than a database model that has a unique key and then a humanreadable fieldp  pa hrefhttpwww.washingtonpost.comHUMANREADABLEKEYUNIQUEKEY.html relnofollowhttpwww.washingtonpost.comHUMANREADABLEKEYUNIQUEKEY.htmlap  pThe pattern in between the domain backslash and the final backslash is the human readable key. The system finds a record with the UNIQUEKEY and then sees if the humanreadablekey matches what the DB has for that record.p  pI noticed that in the official version of the links, as they are generated from the homepage, include yearmonthday information. Again, its meaningless, as you can alter those and get the same page thankfully, no JS seems to depend on parsing those.p  pIm guessing the CMS designer didnt want to be bound by dates, as a news story could break on 8202011 but the print version goes live on 8212011...Sure, then just dont have dates at all in the URL. If the URL can be changed to emanythingem, then dont train the user to expect documentspecific information in it.p  pNot even the first term after the domain means anything. Thereforep  precodehttpwww.washingtonpost.compoliticsmittromneydebatesuseconomygIQAocHrpJstory.html codepre  pGoes to the same story asp  precodehttpwww.washingtonpost.comsexmittromneydebatesuseconomygIQAocHrpJstory.html codepre  pAnd finally, doesnt this play havoc with Google and other search enginesp

Negative 22 pOver the years Ive often asked myself why game developers place many small images into a big one. But not only game developers do that. I also remember the good old Winamp MP3 player had a user interface design file which was just one huge image containing lots of small ones.p  pI have also seen some big javascript GUI libraries like ext.js using this technique. In ext.js there is a big image containing many small ones.p  pOne thing I noticed is this No matter how small my PNG image is, the Finder on the Mac always tells me it consumes at least 4kb. Which is heck of a lot if you have just 10 pixels.p  pSo is this done because storing 20 or more small images into a big one is much more memory efficient versus having 20 separate files, each of them probably with its own header and metadatap  pIs it because locating files on the file system is expensive and slow, and therefore much faster to simply locate only one big image and then split it up into smaller ones, once it is loaded into memoryp  pOr is it lazyness, because it is tedious to think of so many file namesp  pIs ther a name for this technique And how are those small images separated from the big one at runtimep

Negative 22 pI created a GWT marquee which works with a loop that moves the text a couple of pxs ahead every few miliseconds. Did not use the  element because its not compliant and frowned upon. Did not use CSS3HTML5 because IE does not yet support it.p  pNow I also added a mouseListener to capture the mouseover and mouseOut events, so that when the mouse is over the marquee, the scrolling pauses.p  pEverything works perfectly in chrome, Firefox, safari etc. But NOT IE Thank you, MSFTp  pWhen I move the mouse in, the marquee pauses as expected, but when I move the mouse out, sometimes not consistently  especially if I move the mouse really quickly, the marquee doesnt resume scrolling until half a second or a second later. It looks like its taking IE that much time to realize the mouse has left the marquee and trigger an event.p  pThere are quite a few posts on StackOverflow about IE not capturing the MouseOut event at all, but thats not the same as my experience. It seems like the event is always captured eventually, just with a 0.51.5 second delay many of the times.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas what might be the problemp  pThank youp

Negative 22 pIm using Google Maps V3 and its not only having trouble getting exact geolocations, its sometimes not finding the correct city even missing by more than 50 miles in some cases.p  pThe way Im using google maps is in my Rails 3 app with the gem geocoder. I feel pretty sure its not the geocoder gem thats causing google maps to be off, I think Ive had this problem in google maps V3 before. p  pMy question is there a better experience for determining the users location Should I use the browsers built in geolocation features Or should I be using a combination of Google Maps Geolocation and the browsers geolocation functionsp  pI imagined a scenario where I could ask the user if the town was correct, and if not they could enter their town, then store their town in the database, but it seems like a poor user experience. I hope to make this a app on mobile devices in the future, where it wouldnt be much of a problem, but for now its a web app. p  pAnybody else have a good system for dealing with apps that rely on a users location Thanksp

Negative 22 pI would like to use Sikuli to automate both GUI apps and Web apps running within browser on Mac OS X and Windows. My purpose is currently less for testing, and more for GUI automation of tedious, repetitive tasks for a team that unfortunately doesnt have lowerlevel automation access at this time.p  pIm thinking that Id like to build up one or more libraries of screen shots for the GUI apps and Web apps that I can reuse across projects.

Because there are dozens of fields, the user can choose which fields to display in a limited number of columns 5 or so that will be visible e.g., date, sender, text, etc..  The user can search via Linq, sort and select rows of tweets.p  pstrongWPF control 2strong displays each tweet selected in control 1 in the same formatappearance as it would have appeared in Twitter e.g., nice color, the basic text, links, etc. in a small rectangle  Twitter publishes a standard for how tweets should appear.  If no tweets are selected in control 1, then it displays all 17,000 tweets via scrolling.p  pBinding When the user selects rows of tweets in control 1, control 2 is instantly updated to show just the selected tweets in the nice graphic format, and viceversa i.e., select tweets in control 2 shows the selected tweets data in control 1.  There is also a calendar for selecting dates that will result in the associated tweets being displayed in control 1 and control 2.p  pI was thinking about using CollectionViewSource for control 1, however, that does not seem right because strongthe user never deletes or adds tweets to the List of Tweet Objectsstrong.  However, trying to scroll, sort and keep everything running smoothy with 17,000 of data rows and binding to the displayed tweets in control 2, may be too much for other options to handle I do understand how some options can be virtual if necessary.

Negative 22 pIm working on an application where Im opening a modal dialog box.  The dialog box allows the users to add checkboxes like criteria to the modal dialog div being displayed.  They enter the text for the checkbox into a textbox on the page, and click a button to append the checkbox.  The checkbox shows up just fine.  Next to each checkbox, Im also adding a jquery uiicon iconclose image class so that when the X next to the new entry is clicked, the entry is removed from the page.p  pThe problem lies in the fact that simply having the script specified in the page doesnt work.  The div doesnt appear to be a part of the page and defining an onclick listener for all images doesnt do what its supposed.  So my question is, how can I define an image onclick listener within the modal dialog.  For example, in defining the modal dialog box, I can specify an on open function that does something whenever the dialog box is first opened.  I want to, in similar fashion, define a function that is actively listening for whenever an image has been clicked within the modal dialog box.p  pExamplep  precode        ltdiv classrationale styleposition relativegtltdiv classrationaleContainer styledisplayblock height155px overflowy scrollgtltdivgtltdiv classrationaleText styleposition absolute bottom 0 float rightgtltinput typetext placeholderAdd rationale idrationaleBox stylewidth 540px maxlength180gtltdivgtltdivgt.dialog         height 300,         width 600,         modal true,         closeOnEscape false,         resizable false,         title Comments for   item,         open functionevent, ui             .uidialogtitlebarclose.hide             .uidialogtitle.afterlti stylefontsize 12px float rightgtvalueltigt             .uidialog .uidialogbuttonpane .uidialogbuttonset.cssfloat, none         , codepre  pSimilar to the open function being defined, I want to create a listener for image clicksp

Negative 22 pOn Nvidia GPUs, when I call codeclEnqueueNDRangecode, the program waits for it to finish before continuing. More precisely, Im calling its equivalent C binding, codeCommandQueueenqueueNDRangecode, but this shouldnt make a difference.

Negative 22 pI know title of my question doesnt make any sense. So what happened is Ive run my app once. I stored current date in NSUserDefaults. I closed the app. Then the next day by changing the date in system I opened the app in simulator, did the same action again. And primarily stored Current date in NSUserDefaults was also updated to todays value.p  pInstead if I run the app again through Xcode. It returns values as expected. I just want to know the difference between these two operations. Running the app again and again makes the app work properly. But running once and reopening and using it again doesnt make it happen.

Negative 22 pI have a messy Delphi 7 legacy system to maintain and develop. I am already reading Working effectively with legacy code and I like this book very much. p  pIn order to start following the advices in the book, I created a test project and tried to write a single test. To do this I need to add some unit to the test project, but here lies the problem the system under test has horrific uses dependencies. One unit uses some other unit, that uses some other unit and so on, and so on. It seems that most units directly or indirectly use one particular unit, and this unit in turn has 170 dependencies in its uses clause. There are indirect circular dependencies also. p  pCurrently I am trying to add all of the legacy systems units into the test project, but I am running into all kind of problems, like unit xxx was compiled with a different version of xxx, and others.p  pSo I wonder if I am doing something wrong. I have used unit testing before, but in my own projects, that were smaller and with better structure and modularization. What are the options I have in this situation Am I missing somethingp

Negative 22 pWhat I am having trouble figuring out  How to capture 4 button clicks and check if they match the correct sequence similar to entering a 4 digit ATM debit card PIN numberp  pI have a WPF Application and added a new Window that has a PIN pad, numbers 09, a question mark button used as a help button, a backspace button in case you clicked the wrong number, a TextBox at the top which displays a dot instead of the number Wingdings  letter l, and a hidden TextBlock which would show an Incorrect PIN message if the numbers were not entered in the correct order. For the time being, I am just going to hard code the 4 digit PIN 7410 for example since my main goal is learning how to capture and validate the button click sequence. Since I will not be using an Enter key button, I want to continue to the next page as soon as the last number is clicked and the sequence was correct, else display the notification message that the PIN is incorrect. I will also put code in to not allow anything except mouse clicks work and limit the TextBox to only allow a max of 4 digits.p  pIm guessing I need a method that is called on each button click which keeps track of the sequence and loops back through each time until all 4 numbers are clicked in the correct sequence then moves on to the next page. Sorry if Im not explaining well, still learning, so if you need more details Ill do my best to give more.p  pThank you in advance.p  pBelow is the xaml code for the PIN pad.p  precodeltBorder BorderThickness1 BorderBrushBlackgt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition gt             ltRowDefinition HeightAuto gt             ltRowDefinition gt             ltRowDefinition gt             ltRowDefinition gt             ltRowDefinition gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltColumnDefinition gt             ltColumnDefinition gt             ltColumnDefinition gt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt          ltBorder BackgroundBlack Height50 Grid.ColumnSpan3 VerticalAlignmentStretch HorizontalAlignmentStretchgt             ltTextBlock xNamePINTextBlock ForegroundWhite FontSize18 FontFamilyWingdings VerticalAlignmentCenter HorizontalAlignmentCenter MaxWidth4 gt         ltBordergt          ltTextBlock xNameErrorMessageTextBlock ForegroundRed VisibilityCollapsed Grid.ColumnSpan3 Grid.Row1 gt          ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal Grid.Row2gt             ltButton xNameSevenButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickSevenButtonClick TabIndex9gt                 ltTextBlock Text7 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameEightButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickEightButtonClick TabIndex10gt                 ltTextBlock Text8 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameNineButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickNineButtonClick TabIndex11gt                 ltTextBlock Text9 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt         ltStackPanelgt          ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal Grid.Row3gt             ltButton xNameFourButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickFourButtonClick TabIndex6gt                 ltTextBlock Text4 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameFiveButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickFiveButtonClick TabIndex7gt                 ltTextBlock Text5 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameSixButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickSixButtonClick TabIndex8gt                 ltTextBlock Text6 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt         ltStackPanelgt          ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal Grid.Row4gt             ltButton xNameOneButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickOneButtonClick TabIndex3gt                 ltTextBlock Text1 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameTwoButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickTwoButtonClick TabIndex4gt                 ltTextBlock Text2 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameThreeButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickThreeButtonClick TabIndex5gt                 ltTextBlock Text3 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt         ltStackPanelgt          ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal Grid.Row5gt             ltButton xNameQuestionMarkButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickQuestionMarkButtonClick TabIndex0gt                 ltTextBlock Text FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameZeroButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickZeroButtonClick TabIndex1gt                 ltTextBlock Text0 FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt             ltButton xNameBackspaceButton HorizontalAlignmentStretch VerticalAlignmentStretch Width50 Height50 ClickBackspaceButtonClick TabIndex2gt                 ltTextBlock Text FontFamilyWingdings FontSize24 FontWeightBold gt             ltButtongt         ltStackPanelgt      ltGridgt ltBordergt codepre

Negative 22 pWhen designing Android layouts there is often a question  should you sacrifice readability for performance For example, you can put the same components into several nested layouts or one complex RelativeLayout. My understanding is, only in the cases when there is excess nesting more than 810 levels, or this is a repeating element in an adapter, you should try to flatten the hierarchy by using RelativeLayout. Maybe Im wrong and you should by default prefer complex RelativeLayouts over a combination of FrameLinearRelativeLayouts, because a new level in view hierarchy is substantial for performance and memory usep

Negative 22 pI am developping a web application that needs to generate and compute a bunch of arrays at startup. I would like to show a loading page while this occurs, and maybe play a little with css animations, but it seems that CSS animations will hang while javascript is executed.

So I end up with either having to wait 400ms between each loop, loosing 4 seconds doing nothing but animations, having a smooth animation at the end loosing the benefits of displaying a progress bar, or not animating the bar.p

The codeonFinishedcode method should only be called when a timer successfully completes its countdown without being interrupted by the user.p

Water 2 is only used if w1 is depleted. r1 has the maximum priority. If all entities request simultaneously, r1s supply must not fall below 50. codepre  pp  pThe water sources are not discrete but rather continuous, this will increase the difficulty of creating the model.

Not sure what is the best way to start tackling this problem. I am only interested in the model, or a code sample of how can this be put together.p  pemeditemp  pNow imagine I do a crude discretization of the water sources to have w1[0...4] and w2[0...4] for 0, 25, 50, 75,100 percent respectively.p  p means emimpliesemp  pUsage of water sources   p  ul liif w1[0]w2[4]  meaning if water source 1 has 0, then use 100 of water source 2 etcli liif w1[1]w2[3]li liif w1[2]w2[2]li liif w1[3]w2[1]li liif w1[4]w2[0]li ul  pr1r2r3[0,1]  0 means request emOFFem and 1 means request emONemp  pNow what model can be designed that will give each request 100 water depending on the values of w1 and w2 w1 and w2 values are uncontrollable so cannot define specific value, but 0...4 is used for simplicity p

Negative 22 pActually i am building a software for academic institutions, so i just wanted to know answers of a few questionsp  pAs you know the some new data will be generated each yearfor new admissions and some will be upgraded. So i should store all the data in one single table with academic year separationas a columns like acyear, or should i make separate tables for each year. Also that there are different tables to store information like, classes,marks,fee,hostel,etc  about the students. So each Info, like Fee would be stored in different tables like  Fee2010 Fee2011 Fee2012...p  pOr in 1 single Fee table with year as a columns. p  pOne more point is that soon after 12 years database will get heavier so backing up data for a single year would be possible in single tableLike Fee with year as a column p  pAnd Please answer keeping in mind SQL Server 2005.p  pThanksp

Negative 22 pright now I have an app with a couple of pages in which the user uses a ListPicker to select certain values, which are saved into public string variables. When the user reaches the last page, several textblock controls read the string variables and display the string. Along with this, a timer is shown that starts counting when the user reached this last page. p  pNow, if the user leaves the app by pressing the home button and then uses the app switcher to go back to it, the last page shows up without a hitch, all textblocks showing their variables and the timer hasnt stopped. However, if the user relaunches the app from the home screen instead of switching to it, all variables are lost and the app starts on the first page.p  pWhat I want to do is save the string variables and the timer, and have the app load the variables on startup if  null. If they exist, and the app is able to load them, navigate to the last page and show them. Otherwise, if there are no variables to load, simply continue normal operations.p  pHow can I go about doing this Ive read about isolated storage and saving states, but quite honestly, havent been able to accomplish anything, and its really driving me crazy. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 22 pFor a project I am currently working on, I am required to use triggers to restrict users access to a database. However, since there are no triggers on SELECT statements, I need to find some alternative method for adding restrictions before a SELECT statement is executed.

Negative 22 pOkay, so I have a problem. p  pI have an activity, which controls an ActionBar. In its onCreate i populate the actionbar like thisp  precodeprotected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      ...some other things     ActionBar actionBar  getActionBar     actionBar.setNavigationModeActionBar.NAVIGATIONMODETABS     actionBar.setDisplayShowTitleEnabledtrue     actionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue     siteSpecificFragmentManager.populateActionBarthis, actionBar  codepre  pThe last line refers to my method that populates action bar with tabs depending on what tabs I want to show, which ones I want to hide, etc, etc... An example Im using looks like this. CategoriesFragment is a ListFragment that has no corresponding layout xml, and OfflineFragment is a simple Fragment with a layout xml.p  precodepublic void populateActionBarActivity activity, ActionBar bar       Tab tab  bar.newTab.setTextR.string.tabsites.setTabListener                     new TabListenerltCategoriesFragmentgtactivity,tag1,CategoriesFragment.class     bar.addTabtab      tab  bar.newTab.setTextR.string.taboffline.setTabListener                     new TabListenerltOfflineFragmentgtactivity,tag2, OfflineFragment.class     bar.addTabtab   codepre  pTabListener looks like thisp  precodepublic class MyFragmentListenerltT extends Fragmentgt implements     android.app.ActionBar.TabListener   public MyFragmentListenerActivity activity, String tag, ClassltTgt tClass      thisactivity, tag, tClass, null   public MyFragmentListenerActivity activity, String tag, ClassltTgt tClass,         Bundle bundle       this.activity  activity     this.tag  tag     this.tClass  tClass     this.bundle  bundle      fragment  activity.getFragmentManager.findFragmentByTagtag     iffragment  null ampamp fragment.isDetached         FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  activity.getFragmentManager.beginTransaction         fragmentTransaction.detachfragment         fragmentTransaction.commit        Override public void onTabReselectedTab tab, FragmentTransaction ft    Override public void onTabSelectedTab tab, FragmentTransaction ft      iffragment  null         fragment  Fragment.instantiateactivity, tClass.getName,bundle         ft.addandroid.R.id.content,fragment, tag      else         ft.attachfragment        Override public void onTabUnselectedTab tab, FragmentTransaction ft      iffragment  null         ft.detachfragment        codepre  pOk, all set, lets try whether it works. When the activity starts, I see two tabs on ActionBar, I can switch between both without any problems. First tab contains the list, second tab contains some other things. p  pWhen I select an item from the list, I want to push a new ListFragment, called SubcategoryFragment onto it. Heres how Im doing itp  precodepublic void onListItemClickListView l, View v, int position, long id      Bundle bundle  new Bundle     bundle.putStringchosen, category[position]      Fragment fragment  new SubcategoryFragment     fragment.setArgumentsbundle      FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction     fragmentTransaction.replacegetId, fragment     fragmentTransaction.setTransitionFragmentTransaction.TRANSITFRAGMENTOPEN     fragmentTransaction.addToBackStackcategorytosubcategory     fragmentTransaction.commit  codepre  pAnd the problems are p  p1 When I select an item in the first tab, my fragment is replaced by the subcategory fragment. However, the list of the subcategory fragment overlays the content of the second, offline tab, the list drawn over the contents. p  p2 When I press back after switching from category to subcategory, the subcategory fragment pops, and Im returned to category list. Thats okay. When I select a category, to make a subcategoryfragment, switch to the second tab, and press back, the list disappears. When I click back to 1st tab, the Category fragment is not visible. p  p3 When I do the things mentioned above, and instead of pressing back in the second tab, i switch back to first tab, and then press back, Im greeted withp  precode0615 201112.151 EAndroidRuntime18971 java.lang.IllegalStateException Fragment already added CategoriesFragment414d9350 0 id0x1020002 fanfictionnetcategories codepre  pSo, as you can see, something doesnt work as Id like it to.

Negative 22 pIm doing a breadthfirst search on a digraph. Im lost at nodes c and f, and Im not sure if and how they should be in the BFtree or if you only go as far as reachable from the source node and dont start at another node in order to get all the vertices.  p  pHeres what Im getting so far. As you can see, letters mark the nodes. Distance and predecessor are marked by d and pip  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comScRLz.jpg altBFS digraphp  pThis was helpful a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2582576bfstraversalofdirectedgraphfromagivennodeBFS traversal of directed graph from a given nodea but Im not familiar with graphs enough to understand how that applies to this situation.  From what Im getting from that question, it seems like in this case I would not include c and f at all.  p  pIn fact, it seems like I have the maximal number of nodes included already, just because I started at i.  I think that the d4 at the g node also at k but that doesnt even connect to any other nodes, this is the greatest distance and maxdepth possible in BFS in this graph.p

Negative 22 pI have defined a module codeCompcode whose operations are quite costly. In most of the cases, for a value of type codeComp.tcode, a value of type codeintcode can be calculated, which can be used to accelarate many operations. So I define a type codexcode as follows which represents 2 cases 1 the integer has been calculated 2 otherwisep  precodetype x  A of Comp.t, int  B of Comp.t codepre  pA function codeconvert x gt xcode has been written to try to calculate the integer for a codeComp.tcode, it is possible that this integer does not exist, this function is costly as wellp  precodelet convert v x x    match v with    A  gt v    B c gt      try to calculate the integer i from c,      return A c, i if the integer is found otherwise, return B c.  codepre  pInitially, a comparaison function codeless thancode can be written like thisp  precodeopen Comp  let lt x0 x x1 x bool    let x0, x1  Comp.convert x0, Comp.convert x1 in   match x0, x1 with      A c0, i0, A c1, i1 gt        i0 lt i1  which is very fast       A c0, , B c1  B c0, A c1,   B c0, B c1 gt        Comp.lt c0 c1  which is quite slow   ... let b0  lt x0o x1o in let b1  le x0o x1o in  le call convert too   let b2  ge x0o x1o in  ge call convert too  ... codepre  pAs codeconvertcode is costly, and there are many other functions than codeltcode which may call it from time to time e.g. codelecode, codegecode, I would like to make the conversion impact the value outside. For instance, I want the codeltcode to change the value of codex0ocode and codex1ocode, so that the functions later e.g. codelecode, codegecode receive arguments which probably have already been converted, that results in a faster computation for the whole block.p  pSo I guess something like mutable record should be used, could anyone give me an example Also, in general, is it a good idea to do this permitting side effects to optimise the computationp

What should I do in this case I have the process info, such as its ID and thread ID from codeCreateProcesscode, but I still do not know how to get its hwnd. I did read thisp  blockquote   pAfter you call codeCreateProcesscode, examine the codePROCESSINFORMATIONcode   struct pointed to by lpProcessInformation argument.   codePROCESSINFORMATIONcode contains a handle to the Process you just   started and a Thread ID. With this information call the   codeGetGUIThreadInfocodefunction and then examine the codeGUITHREADINFOcode   struct pointed to by lpgui. codeGUITHREADINFOcode has several HWNDs. Start   with hwndActive, and call codeGetParentcode or codeGetAncestorcode untill the   Main window is found.p      pBy bugcrusherp blockquote  pI have tried codeEnumChildWindowscode and codeEnumWindowscode, and they did not work.p  precodeBOOL CALLBACK EnumWindowsProcHWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam      DWORD PID 0     GetWindowThreadProcessIdhwnd,ampPID     ifPID  1              ,,,,,,,,          return TRUE  codepre  pBut I dont get it, can anyone explain thatp
Negative 22 pIve been struggling to find a way to XOR two hex numbers stored in strings correctly for a couple of days now, and I have come across two methods, both of which make sense to me but produce different results. I am not that versed in Python as in, I have like 3 days of experience D, so I cannot figure out which method is correct.p  pMethod 1p  precodes1  hex number stored in a string 1 s2  hex number stored in a string 2  Decoding the hex strings into ASCII symbols s3  s1.decodehex s4  s2.decodehex  strxor  see the next code segment for the code of this function xor1  strxors3, s4  Encode the result back into ASCII xor2  xor1.encodehex codepre  pstrxor functionp  precodeThis was given in my assignment and I am not entirely sure what is going on in here. Ive been told that it takes two ASCII strings as input, converts them to numbers, XORs the numbers and converts the result back to ASCII again.  def strxora, b          if lena gt lenb         return .join[chrordx  ordy for x, y in zipa[lenb], b]     else         return .join[chrordx  ordy for x, y in zipa, b[lena]] codepre  pMethod 2p  precodes1  ciphertext 1  hex number in a string s2  ciphertext 2  hex number in a string  convert the string to integers, xor them and convert back to hex xor  hexints1, 16  ints2, 16 codepre  pAs I said before, to my limited brain these two solutions seem identical, yet they produce completely different results. What is the problem I have both Python 2.7.3 and 3.3.2 on my system, and Ive tried both although not for method 1, as python 3 no longer has the decode function for stringsp
Negative 22 pI am trying to implement Drag and Drop using c0deformers jQuery UI implementation see here a hrefhttpcodef0rmer.github.ioangulardragdrop relnofollowhttpcodef0rmer.github.ioangulardragdropa The dragging part works fine, but I cant seem to get the functionality I am after in terms of the drop. In this application, I want to be able to drop the draggable items anywhere within a target div, i.e., I dont want the destination scope to be limited to a listtype structure or a set of repeated divs. Mainly this is because the user will be dragging items on the fly and there will be no way of knowing how many items the user will drag and drop in advance. p  pI have scoured the web and cannot find an example in Angular that uses drag and drop without effectively dragging from one list to another list. Can this be done If so, I am not sure how I would appropriately update the scope after an item has been dragged. In this example code below, the dropped items are pushed into the scope of a second list and the new scope is applied. Ideally, the scope of the dropped items is the target div I mentioned above. Im really new to Angular, so any advice is immensely appreciated.p  pSnippet from c0deformer p  precodeapp.directivedroppable, functioncompile      return          restrict A,         link functionscope,element,attrs             This makes an element Droppable             element.droppable                 dropfunctionevent,ui                      var dragIndex  angular.elementui.draggable.dataindex,                         dragEl  angular.elementui.draggable.parent,                         dropEl  angular.elementthis                          console.logdropEl                      if dragEl.hasClasslist1 ampamp dropEl.hasClasslist1 ampamp reject  true                      scope.list2.pushscope.list1[dragIndex]                     scope.list1.splicedragIndex, 1                  else if dragEl.hasClasslist2 ampamp dropEl.hasClasslist2 ampamp reject  true                      scope.list1.pushscope.list2[dragIndex]                     scope.list2.splicedragIndex, 1                                  scope.apply                              codepre

Negative 22 pI have a jQuery filter built that sorts elements by 2 different sets of criteria, Market Sector and Project Type. Each set of criteria uses an unordered dropdown list with anchor tags.p  pWhat Id like to do now is add the same on click filter functionality to a group of images on the page for the Market Sector criteria only.p  pFor example, I currently have 6 different market sectors. On initial page load, 6 images load inside of a div with class categoryimages, one representing each market sector. From there the user can either click on one of the images to filter the list of projects by that market sector, OR they can use the unordered list dropdowns to filter projects.p  pI have tried adding div.categoryimages a to the click function but that doesnt work.

Negative 22 pI have an ordered list of divs in a codeltdiv idmainContentgtcode. I want these divs to float top to bottom until the bottom of the page then if possible they move over a column and continue. If it can do nothing else it will have the items continue off the bottom of the page. The page should be allowed to be dynamically resized which means that if I cut off a column after resizing, its elements should be appended to the previous columns. p  pThis is essentially what floattop would be if it existed. I should note that I will be using my site on mobile browsers so CSS3 is out. jQuery can be used though. I have tried masonry, but it doesnt enforce my ordering, it just acts like float left, but will rearrange items of differing size to most efficiently use the available space which is what the masonry homepage says it will do. p  pIs there anything that does this already I would rather not have to custom script this if I can avoid it.p

Negative 22 pIve got a complex question Ive been working on for a good week now trying to work correctly. I am using WPF .NET 4.5, the MVVM pattern, and Prism.

For each node that is visible, I want to show the Name and Status. That is, for each codeIScriptcode in codeLoadedScriptscode show a textbox of codeScriptDescription.Namecode and codeScriptDescription.Statuscode. For each child codeISectionDescriptioncode, a TextBox containing codeISectionDescription.Namecode and codeISectionDescription.Statuscode.p  pThis is all fairly straightforward, except for the fact that Im binding to Interfaces. I found how Im supposed to be able to overcome this, using a codeDataTemplateSelectorcode, but my treeview isnt displaying the text correctly in my templates. Instead, I am getting the codeobject.ToStringcode for the codeIScriptcodes in my codeObservableCollectionltIScriptgt LoadedScriptscode with no children. Im not getting any kind of errors or warnings in the codeOutputcode window either.p  pI feel like I am really close but I cant get it to correctly display my data. I have verified I am indeed getting my data and if I put a basic codeDataTemplatecode for codeTreeView.ItemTemplatecode I am able to display the toplevel codeIScriptcode nodes.

Negative 22 pMy work laptop is is a member of a domain the OS is Windows 8. Created a new VM, locally on this laptop using builtin HyperV. DHCP is provided by the domain and all IP addresses are assigned by the DHCP, both to the host and to the VM. The VM is not a member of the domain, just a member of the WORKGROUP. Trying to ping a local VM from the host. Pinging by machine name does not work. Pinging by IP address works just fine. Both host OS and the VM are on the same subnetwork.p  pThe IP addresses change every time I reconnect the laptop to office network.

Negative 22 pSuppose I have a string p  blockquote   pLikes 20p blockquote  pI want to fetch the substring enclosed in round brackets in above case its 20 from this string. This substring can change dynamically at runtime. It might be any other number from 0 to infinity. To achieve this my idea is to use a codeforcode loop that traverses the whole string and then when a codecode is present, it starts adding the characters to another character array and when codecode is encountered, it stops adding the characters and returns the array. But I think this might have poor performance. I know very little about regular expressions, so is there a regular expression solution available or any function that can do that in an efficient wayp

Negative 22 pSo I am using Yii and full calendar as a widget which is called in a view of CalendarController. Uppon call for a widget, the widget retrives existing events from the DB and puts them inside the full calendar to display. Now I have also made a simple filter for filtering out events by category they are in  dropdown with a submit , so I want to send request to a calendarController method called actionEvents which then takes what is passed to it  the category of events for which we want to retrieve events , gets them back to the jQuery which then calls the calendar again passing it a jsonencoded array of needed properties to correctly render events under the selected category in the dropdown. The problem I have is that it seems fullcalendar is doing my wanted call  POST  as well as one another GET call along with it for some reason so it does return properly formatted json to the jQuery from the method of controller, but just shows an empty calendar without events in it on return. This is how the console looks like after the returned data.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZANhz.jpg altenter image description herep  pThis is the code that calls ajax callp  precodedocument.readyfunction              var date  new Date,                 d  date.getDate,                 m  date.getMonth,                 y  date.getFullYear              form.eventFilter.submitfunction                  var selectedOption  form.eventFilter select.val,                     eventContainer  .fceventcontainer                  var objectToSend   categories  [selectedOption],datefrom  september2013month    year , dateto  september2013month    year                  .ajax                         url ltphp echo YiiappgtcreateUrlcalendarevents gt,                         type POST,                         asyncfalse,                         data data  JSON.stringifyobjectToSend,                         success functiondata                               fccalendar.html                             fccalendar.fullCalendar                                 events data                                                          console.logdata                         ,                         error function                              console.logdata                                                                 return false                       codepre  pThe code that renders initial calendar events on first page load  open  is this p  precodeltdiv idfccalendargtltdivgt     ltscript classfccalendarscriptgt          gets calendar and its events working and shown         var date  new Date         var d  date.getDate         var m  date.getMonth         var y  date.getFullYear          fccalendar.fullCalendar             header                  left prev,next today,                 center title,                 right month,basicWeek,basicDay             ,             editable true,             events [             ltphp foreach eventItems as event gt                              title ltphp echo htmlentitiesevent[eventItems][title] gt,                 start new Datey,m,d  ltphp echo event[eventItems][startdatedaydifference] gt,                 end   new Datey,m,d  ltphp echo event[eventItems][enddatedaydifference] gt,                 url ltphp echo event[eventItems][url] gt,                 className [                 ltphp foreachevent[eventCategories] as category  echo .jsonencodecategory[slug]., gt  and categories slugs as classnames, same purpose                 ]             ,             ltphp endforeach gt             ]              ltscriptgt codepre  pThe code in controller is not that important since you can see what it returns in the screenshot  If someone has an idea of how to get around this I would really be grateful  Tried everything I know p  pstrongOk so bounty goes to whoever answers this question strong  I am having problems with full calendar month rendering when ajax data is returned and events populated. Since I have checkboxes for each category  events have MANYMANY relation with categories  and each time a checkbox is checked or unchecked, JSON array of chosen categories of events is passed on to PHP method which queries DB for all events that go under chose categories and returns all events in a jquery encoded array to the view which then takes that events array and rerenders the calendar like shown in the upper code. Problem is that when a checkbox is checked or unchecked and ajax returned the calendar always renders on the current month  so right now it would always rerender itself to show events for september, untill the end of the month, then always for Ocbober and so on , but what if a user was on lets say November 2013 when he checked event category for which he wanted to filter the events The calendar would rerender on September still. How could I make it rerender on the month the user was on when he checked  unchecked a checkbox p  pThe code that I have which keeps track  or at least it should  of the current month when prev or next month buttons are clicked is thisp  precode.fcbuttonnext span.clickfunction                 start  fccalendar.fullCalendargetView.visEnd                 console.logstart                           .fcbuttonprev span.clickfunction                 start  fccalendar.fullCalendargetView.visStart                 console.logstart              codepre  pHowever this code is not tracking properly, sometimes it skips a month, sometimes it stays on the month without change and sometimes it returns propper month, which is bugging me so I cant call this function of the calendar properly which should set calendar to propper month on rerender.p  precodefccalendar.fullCalendargotoDate, start codepre

I cant think of what to do to allow setImage to take an interchangeable image path based on which item was selected. I would be very very grateful for any pointers or solutionsp  pGo to the switch statements in strongapplyMenuChoicestrong to see where Im stuck p  h1MenuDemo.Javah1  precodepublic class MenuDemo extends ListActivity      TextView selection     TextView displayText     String[] flavorItems     String[] colors     ImageView myImage     int currentMenu      private final String TAG  Main Activity      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.main          selectionTextViewfindViewByIdR.id.selection         displayTextTextViewfindViewByIdR.id.displayText         myImageImageViewfindViewByIdR.id.myImage         flavorItems  getResources.getStringArrayR.array.flavors         colors  getResources.getStringArrayR.array.colors          setListAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, R.layout.flavormenustyle, flavorItems          registerForContextMenugetListView         displayText.setTextWelcome Click and hold flavor to learn more about it.           public void onListItemClickListView parent, View v,int position, long id                   if currentMenu  1selection.setTextcolors[position]         else selection.setTextflavorItems[position]          listPosition  position           Override     public void onCreateContextMenuContextMenu menu, View v,ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo menuInfo               super.onCreateContextMenumenu, v, menuInfo         MenuInflater inflater  getMenuInflater         inflater.inflateR.menu.activitymenudemo, menu           Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu                      MenuInflater inflater  getMenuInflater         inflater.inflateR.menu.activitynew, menu          return true               Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item  item is the menu item chosen          boolean ret  applyOptionMenuChoiceitem         if  ret  false             ret  super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem          return ret             Override     public boolean onContextItemSelectedMenuItem item               boolean ret  applyMenuChoiceitem         if  ret  false             ret  super.onContextItemSelecteditem          return ret            private boolean applyMenuChoiceMenuItem item          switch item.getItemId                   case R.id.picture         myImage.setImageResourceItemImageSource[0]             setImageDrawablegetResources.getDrawableR.drawable.listPosition              returntrue          case R.id.ingredients             ingredients action will go here             returntrue          case R.id.order             getListView.setDividerHeight8             order action will go here          case R.id.price             price action will go here             returntrue                    returnfalse            private boolean applyOptionMenuChoiceMenuItem item          switch item.getItemId                   case R.id.colormenu             Log.iTAG,             setListAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, R.layout.colormenustyle, colors             currentMenu  1             returntrue          case R.id.flavormenu              Log.iTAG,             setListAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, R.layout.flavormenustyle, flavorItems             currentMenu  2             returntrue                    returnfalse          codepre  h1Main.xmlh1  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         androidorientationvertical         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent          androidbackgroundcolorbackgroundColor          gt          ltTextView                 androidididselection                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidbackgroundffffffff                 androidminHeight40dp                 androidpaddingLeft6dip                 androidgravitycentervertical                 androidtextStylebold         gt          ltListView             androididandroididlist             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androiddrawSelectorOnTopfalse gt          ltImageView             androidididmyImage             androidlayoutwidth242dp             androidlayoutheight188dp             androidadjustViewBoundstrue             androidsrcdrawableicecream1             androidlayoutgravitycenter          gt           ltTextView                 androidididdisplayText                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidbackgroundffffffff                 androidpadding20dp                  androidfontFamilysansseriflight                 androidtextStylenormalbolditalic                 androiddrawableLeftdrawableice2         gt   ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE1vEG.png altenter image description herep

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.ltspangtltpgt,descriptionshortltpgtltstronggtLorem Ipsumltstronggtu00a0is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.ltpgt,descriptiongujltpgtu0aaau0ab0u0acdu0ab5u0aa4u0aaeu0abeu0ab3u0abeu0aa8u0ac0 u0a85u0a82u0aa6u0ab0 u0aaau0acdu0ab0u0ab5u0ac7u0ab6u0ac7 u0a9bu0ac7 u0aa4u0ac7u0ab5u0abeu0a82 u0aacu0ab9u0ac1 u0aa5u0acbu0aa1u0abeu0a82 u0ab8u0acdu0aa5u0ab3u0acbu0aaeu0abeu0a82u0aa8u0abe u0a8fu0a95 u0ab5u0abeu0a9fu0ac7 u0a85u0aaeu0ac7 u0aa4u0abfu0aacu0ac7u0a9fu0aaeu0abeu0a82 u0aa6u0abeu0a96u0ab2 u0aa5u0aafu0abe u0ab9u0aa4u0abe. u0a86 u0ab5u0a96u0aa4u0ac7 u0a85u0aaeu0ac7 u0a86u0a97u0ab3 u0a95u0ac7u0a9fu0ab2u0ac7 u0ab8u0ac1u0aa7u0ac0 u0a9cu0a88 u0ab6u0a95u0ab6u0ac1u0a82 u0aa4u0ac7u0aa8u0ac0 u0a9au0abfu0a82u0aa4u0abe, u0a85u0ab2u0aacu0aa4u0acdu0aa4, u0ab9u0ab5u0ac7 u0a85u0aaeu0aa8u0ac7 u0aa5u0ab5u0abe u0ab2u0abeu0a97u0ac0. u0ab8u0abeu0ab0u0ac7 u0aa8u0ab8u0ac0u0aacu0ac7 u0a85u0ab9u0ac0u0a82 u0a85u0aaeu0aa8u0ac7 u0a95u0acbu0a88 u0a93u0ab3u0a96u0aa4u0ac1u0a82 u0aa8u0ab9u0acbu0aa4u0ac1u0a82, u0aa8u0ac7 u0a95u0acbu0a88 u0a9du0ac7u0ab0u0ac0u0ab2u0abe u0a85u0aaeu0ab2u0aa6u0abeu0ab0u0ac7 u0ab2u0acbu0a95u0acbu0aa8u0ac7 u0a85u0aaeu0abeu0ab0u0abeu0aa5u0ac0 u0aadu0aa1u0a95u0abeu0ab5u0ac7u0ab2u0abe u0aaau0aa3 u0aa8u0ab9u0acbu0aa4u0abe. u0a95u0acbu0a88 u0aaau0ac2u0a9bu0aaau0ab0u0a9b u0a95u0ab0u0aa4u0ac1u0a82, u0aa4u0acb u0a85u0aaeu0ac7 u0a95u0ab9u0ac7u0aa4u0abe u0a95u0ac7 u0a95u0ac8u0ab2u0abeu0ab8u0aa8u0ac0 u0a9cu0abeu0aa4u0acdu0ab0u0abeu0a8f u0aa8u0ac0u0a95u0ab3u0acdu0aafu0abe u0a9bu0ac0u0a8fltpgt,descriptionshortgujltpgtu0aaau0ab0u0acdu0ab5u0aa4u0aaeu0abeu0ab3u0abeu0aa8u0ac0 u0a85u0a82u0aa6u0ab0 u0aaau0acdu0ab0u0ab5u0ac7u0ab6u0ac7 u0a9bu0ac7 u0aa4u0ac7u0ab5u0abeu0a82 u0aacu0ab9u0ac1 u0aa5u0acbu0aa1u0abeu0a82 u0ab8u0acdu0aa5u0ab3u0acbu0aaeu0abeu0a82u0aa8u0abe u0a8fu0a95 u0ab5u0abeu0a9fu0ac7 u0a85 1112 060459.072 WSystem.err2748  at 0 of type java.lang.String cannot be converted to JSONObject 1112 060459.081 WSystem.err2748     at org.json.JSON.typeMismatchJSON.java100 1112 060459.081 WSystem.err2748     at org.json.JSONArray.getJSONObjectJSONArray.java484 1112 060459.081 WSystem.err2748     at app.navbharatpublication.tablet.HomePage.onCreateHomePage.java549 1112 060459.081 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.Activity.performCreateActivity.java5104 1112 060459.091 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreateInstrumentation.java1080 1112 060459.091 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2144 1112 060459.091 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2230 1112 060459.091 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.ActivityThread.access600ActivityThread.java141 1112 060459.091 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1234 1112 060459.091 WSystem.err2748     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 1112 060459.103 WSystem.err2748     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 1112 060459.111 WSystem.err2748     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5041 1112 060459.111 WSystem.err2748     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 1112 060459.111 WSystem.err2748     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 1112 060459.111 WSystem.err2748     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java793 1112 060459.121 WSystem.err2748     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java560 1112 060459.121 WSystem.err2748     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre

Negative 22 pIm using VS2010, MVC 4 with Razor, JQuery 1.8JQueryUI 1.10.3 and AJAX in am AnyCPU web app.  Im seeing really odd behavior where the initialization of a JQueryUI datepicker runs on 34 separate threads outside of my control.

In the end, the HashAggregate is actually the fastest approach for me, but thats due to the nature of my data, not any problems with the algorithms.

Negative 22 pemNoteem Ive seen similar questions, but none of the answers are precise enough, so Im asking this myself.p  h3emThis is a very nitpicky languagelawyer question Im looking for an authoritative answer.emh3  pThe C standard saysp  blockquote   pA program may end the lifetime of any object by reusing the storage which the object occupies or by explicitly calling the destructor for an object of a class type with a nontrivial destructor. For an object of a class type with a nontrivial destructor, the program is not required to call the destructor explicitly before the storage which the object occupies is reused or released emhowever, if there is no explicit call to the destructor or if a deleteexpression is not used to release the storage, the destructor shall not be implicitly called strongand any program that depends on the side effects produced by the destructor has undened behavioremstrong.p blockquote  pI simply emdo not understandem what emdepends on the side effectsem means.p  pThe general question isp  h3Is forgetting to call a destructor any different than forgetting to call an ordinary function with the same bodyh3  pA specific example to illustrate my point isp  pConsider a program like this below.

Negative 22 pSo I have an index page with a menu and a shoppingcart. You can view items and add them to the shopping cart. All data is from a server backend, and that part seems to work. The problem is that the shoppingcart doesnt update when you add or remove items from it. You have to manualy refresh the page for the view to update. I have no idea where the problem is, so any hints would be appreciated The backend is grails so there are some gsp specificsp  pindex.gspp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta

Negative 22 pI want to find a way to change an .apks namespace without having to fiddle with it at the source level.  I know I can copy a project in eclipse and change the namespace that way but I dont want to go to all that trouble.  I may want to have dozens of apks that are the same program all with unique namespaces.p  pWhy do I want to do this  I have my reasons.p  pEDIT... After reading initial responses, maybe it would help if I state my reason.  I want to have ten versions of my app on Google Play all with different app names but I dont want to have 10 eclipse projects each with a different namespace.  The ten apps will all install on the phone under the same name  just the name in the store listing is different and maybe a different icon in the store listing.  Google Play requires me to have a unique namespace for each of the ten apps.p  pThis is all because Google Play does not allow keywords to be provided other than the name of the app.  I have five apps on Google Play but they are virtually hidden.  No one can find them. Thanks, Garyp
Negative 22 pDue to a mistake in an article, one of our links was added as strongmydomain.comindexstrong instead of strongmydomain.comindex.htmlstrong or simply strongmydomain.comstrong.

Negative 22 pIm creating PostgreSQL view. part of the problem was solved here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21405207postgresqlcountdataaszeroifitisnullwhenwhereclauseisusedPostgreSQL  count data as zero if it is null when where clause is usedap  pThe problem Im having is that I need to use condition in LEFT JOIN as variable as I dont know what kind of date will be used to filter before runtime of that query view. This kind of view is used in OpenERP. It uses fields to filter results from main SELECT columns. For example when in view you see codeopp.name as namecode, in OpenERP you can filter using this column. This kind of approach would be OK, but I need to see all LEFT table results. What I mean is if I use any filter, it should still show zero null values from right table as in example below. But in OpenERP if you use filter from column that is used in SELECT, then it filters as normal JOIN and result would be only values that exist in both columns or not LEFT JOIN.p  pstrongSo is there some way to somehow describe variable instead of using specific date as condition in LEFT JOINstrong now in example you see this codeAND log.createdate lt 20140129 084903code and I need something like codeAND log.createdate lt somevariablecode.

Negative 22 pI have an event software. There is a table for individuals who sign up to an event and a table for teams that sign up to an event. Both individuals and teams can sign up to the same event. I also have a shirt table. This table will relate a shirt to an individual or a shirt to a team and shirts for teams will have multiple rows because teams are more than 1 individual. Here is the structure.p  precodeIndividuals id eventid memberid  Teams id eventid teamname  shirts id entityid shirtid isteam codepre  pAt first I had a separate individual shirt table and a separate team shirt table and tried to codeunion allcode them to no avail. So now I have a single shirt table with the codeentityidcode being either the individual id or the team id and the codeisteamcode to designate which table.p  pIm struggling with a codejoincode to somehow get all the shirts for individuals and teams based on the codeeventidcode. I would have to show all the individual shirts and all the team shirts.p  pI can paste the codeunioncode statement for my other table structure but I have nothing for the codejoincode to show. Im just looking for a step in the right direction.p

Negative 22 pMy MapReduce job outputs lines of the formp  precodeKey1 5 Key2 8 Key3 4 Key1 7 Key3 3 codepre  pAnd I would like to aggregate these results to get the sum of the values by key. So something likep  precodeKey1 12 5  7 Key2 8 Key3 7 4  3 codepre  pThe naive way would be to simply chain another MapReduce job behind the first one but it is inefficient because you have twice more IO than necessary, the overhead, etc. So I would like to avoid this solution.p  pThe best way to do it would probably be something like codemap gt reduce1 gt reduce2code where the output of reduce1 is the input of reduce2. Unfortunately, it appears to be impossible to do see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16870675chainingmultireducersinahadoopmapreducejobChaining MultiReducers in a Hadoop MapReduce joba for example. I have also looked at a hrefhttpshadoop.apache.orgdocsr2.2.0apiorgapachehadoopmapreducelibchainChainReducer.html relnofollowChainReducera but it doesnt help either since it doesnt allow several reduce steps.p  pSo how would you go about it Is there something new in Hadoop 2.X that I could usep  pThank you.p

Negative 22 pWe have a Spring bean implemented as a singleton default.

Negative 22 pI am working on a game engine which includes a simple GUI development tool.  The GUI tool allows a user to define various entities and components, which can then be saved in a configuration file.  When the game engine runtime loads the configuration file, it can determine how to create the various entities and components for use in the game.p  pFor a configuration file saving mechanism, I am using PyYAML.  The issue that I am having stems from the fact that the serialization process occurs in a module which is in a different directory than the module which loads and parses the file through PyYAML.p  pstrongSimplified Serializerstrongp  precodeimport yaml  def saveconfigcontext, filename     configfile  filefilename, w      do some various processing on the context dict object     yaml.dumpcontext, configfile     configfile.close codepre  pThis takes the codecontextcode object, which is a codedictcode that represents various game objects, and writes it to a config file.

On codeyaml.loadconfigfilecode, I will receive an error, because it fails to find a various name on a certain module.  I understand why this is happening.  For example, when I serialize the config file, it will list an codeAssetComponentcode a component type in the engine as being at codeengine.common.AssetComponentcode.  However, from the deserializers perspective, the codeAssetComponentcode should just be at codecommon.AssetComponentcode because the deserialization code itself exists within the codeenginecode package, so it fails to find it under codeenginecode.p  pIs there a way to manually handle paths when serializing or deserializing with PyYAML  I would like to make sure they both happen from the same perspective.p  pstrongEditstrong The following shows what a problematic config file might look like, followed by what the manually corrected config would look likep  pstrongProblematicstrongp  precodepythonobjectapplycollections.defaultdict args [pythonnamebuiltin.dict ]  dictitems   assets    pythonobjectcommon.Component     component pythonobjectengine.common.AssetComponent filename ..contentsticksheet.png,       surface null     text ..contentsticksheet.png     typename AssetComponent codepre  pstrongCorrectedstrongp  precodepythonobjectapplycollections.defaultdict args [pythonnamebuiltin.dict ]  dictitems   assets    pythonobjecttools.common.Component     component pythonobjectcommon.AssetComponent filename ..contentsticksheet.png,       surface null     text ..contentsticksheet.png     typename AssetComponent codepre

Why am I able to successfully compile and run java programs when opening up the terminal when I click the codecmd.execode icon but am UNABLE to run java programs when the terminal is opened via a simple AutoHotKey scriptp  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pNote My systems path variable and user path variable are correctly set to codeJAVAHOMEcode which points to the code1.8.505code version  p

Negative 22 pI need to send multicast data from eth0 interface and receive it on eth1 on Linux machine.

I have a production code which normally runs on proprietary hardware. This is a piece of software for network communication. All communication is done via multicast. The architecture is that there is a TX task which is sending multicast data to other devices in the network, unfortunately there is a RX task also which is joining the same group as TX task sends data to, because other network devices are communicating with my device on the same mcast address. On production code we have multicast loop disabled and everything is ok, RX task does not receive what TX task is sending. Now we decided to run this software on a linux machine for testing purposes, on the same machine we want to run a software which is simulating all other boxes. What I wanted to accomplish it to bind all mcast sockets on production code to eth0 and on simulator on eth1. But I cant have them communicate with each other. I can configure my network interfaces as I need, add vlans, interfaces or anything, just to make it communicate one with another. What I cant do is to change the architecture of this software.p

Negative 22 pIm in the process of creating a multiplatform but OpenGL favoring game engine on Java for AndroidOUYA and PC, and the PC platform adapter is giving me some issues when rapidly checking gamepad state.p  pIm currently using LWJGLJInput to write the PC adapter, and whenever I poll gamepad state faster than about 30 times a second giving about 33ms to do the poll and update the state, the values obtained from the gamepad are false. False in the sense that the stick can be halfway to the right, and yet getAxisValue returns 0 instead of something near 0.5f out of 1f. On top of that, it seems to take longer than the 33ms that would be fine otherwise when asked to do it more often. What givesp  pIn a nutshell, what happens on a typical update call is that the engine scans through the active players controllers for the state of specific buttons that are actually used in the game, all set and registered ahead of time. At the moment, in my test app, that consists of two buttons and an axis. So all its doing is checking the current state of three inputs, no more. After being passed through a couple layers of interfaces and into a switch block, eventually this is calledp  precodereturn controller.isButtonPressedmap.A codepre  por p  precodereturn controller.getAxisValuemap.LSH codepre  pwhere map contains final ints that link names to specific index values for the given controller.p  pWhat Ive found through my own testingp  ul liThis isnt a hardware issue, as it stays pretty accurate when below 30 to 35 updates per second.li liWhen ramping the speed up to about 60 updates a second to match the 60fps rate of the graphics thread, it causes massive lag on the input thread only. The graphics thread is not affected, which makes me think that it isnt a general performance issue either.li liChanging isButtonPressed or getAxisValue to arbitrary preset values solves the update lag issues, so it isnt my code causing the intermittent stops, definitely isButtonPressed and getAxisValue.li ul  pIs there any way to improve the speed of gamepad checking, or some setting somewhere that I missed that disables unnecessary input routines through LWJGLJInputp  pIs matching 60fps too much to ask in terms of performancep

Negative 22 pI am currently building one of my first custom HTML Element with an AngularJS directive. I want to customize the range input type from HTML5. So far so good, my first steps was made of success. But now I want to enhance the current state with a nested template.

Negative 22 pIm trying to extend lexicalcast to handle stringcvPoint conversions, with code like sop  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltopencv2opencv.hppgt include ltboostlexicalcast.hppgt include ltboostalgorithmstringclassification.hppgt include ltboostalgorithmstringsplit.hppgt  namespace boost    templateltgt     cvPoint2f lexicalcastconst stdstring ampstr        stdvectorltstdstringgt parts       boostsplitparts, str, boostisanyof,       cvPoint2f R       R.x  boostlexicalcastltfloatgtparts[0]       R.y  boostlexicalcastltfloatgtparts[1]       return R        int mainint argc, char argv    auto p  boostlexicalcastltcvPoint2fgtstdstring1,2   stdcout ltlt p   ltlt p ltlt stdendl   return 0  codepre  pAnd it works great..

Negative 22 pI am new to R and have no programming experience. I have tried hard to find the answer to this so apologies if one has already been posted. Maybe somebody could direct me.p  pI have imported a number of data frames into R, which all have the same number of columns and the same headers. However, the column lengths are different on each sheet e.g. column 1 is 200 long in frame1 and 220 long in frame2. p  pI would like to take say column 3 from each frame and combine them into a new frame. This is with the intention of boxplotting the data so maybe I dont even need to combine the data in the first placep  pAgain, apologies if I have overlooked the obvious.p  pMany thanksp  pEdit 151014p  pThanks both for replying.

Negative 22 pFor a project i need to manage power usage in PC by using an externally connected arduino through USB. Power management is done putting the Personal Computer into lower power usage states like sleep, hibernate or shut down. So upon non usage of PC over fixed time, the arudino must detect the non usage and send commands to PC to change the state. brbr Is it possible to program an arduino to work in that way  If yes, please help me with the steps and code. I am totally new to arduino usage and programming. Any help would surely be of great use    .p

Negative 22 pI have some weird problem with my website Im developing. Since a couple of days now, I saw that my favicon and some other images were broken.p  pMy favicon looks like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiwAH7.png altFavicon imagep  pIf I use the bootstrap 3 glyphicons, I get something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw8lht.png altNormal image background is in color, its the white square thats the trouble.p  pI have no idea why this is, but it came all of a sudden probably changed something I cant remember anymore. I thought it could maybe be a temporay problem, and it would maybe go back to the original image after some time. So far it hasnt. Now the most disturbing thing is that the code does work on the server. So when I push my code to the repo and redeploy, the website deploys correctly. All the images are working both the favicon and the glyphicons.p  pSo I think the code is correct otherwise it wouldnt work on the server. Thats the reason why I didnt paste any code but if it could be the code, I would be happy to share. So then I guess the problem is maybe my local testing environment Im now using IntelliJ 13.1.4 on Linux, in combination with a local Tomcat 7.0.54 instance. Im not using the latest versions, but I didnt update just before the problem occured.p  pI already tried to use a different local port, to circumvent the caching of my browser. But that didnt help. Also trying it in different browsers doesnt help. So caching isnt the issue in my opinion.p  pIf I try it in Chrome, I only see the glyphiconshalflingsregular.woff and glyphiconshalflingsregular.ttf files in the Network tab of the Developer tools. These are only of the 2 of the 4 files that are in the fonts directory of Bootstrap 3 also a .svg and .eot file. Should these files also load in Google Chrome Or is this normalp  pWhen I build my project with maven, copy the generated war to my Tomcat webapps folder, the website appears to be like it should images working. So it has to do something with the temporary folder that is used by IntelliJ to show the website.p  pIf anybody could help to fix this problem, I would appreciate it. Ok, its not really a major issue because it is working on the production server but its rather annoying I cant fully test the site on my local machine.p

Negative 22 pIm trying to add a Today Extension to a project Ive been working on for quite some time. In fact the app is in the AppStore already and Im looking to enhance it with a Today Extension.p  pThe problem is that the Extension wont launch at all. Not on the device nor on the simulator.p  pstrongEDITstrong just skip the next sections and read on at the last EDIT as I think I found the problem. I just not sure how to fix it.p  pIve done a test project following a tutorial and it works just fine. The environment seem to be identical. Xcode 6.1.1, iOS 8.1 on the device and simulator.p  pMy project is ObjectiveC based. For the Extension Ive tried both ObjectiveC and Swift targets. On both occasions all three four with objC files were created as expected storyboard, viewController and PLIST. p  pHaving done nothing more as with the example project Im trying to launch the widget with the widget scheme selected. With the test projects the widget would launch while it wont with the actual project.p  pI put a printlnNSLog in the viewDidLoad of the widgets viewController to see if anything happens but nothing.p  pHappy to provide code or settings but at this pointing time Ive no idea where to start. p  pI just realised that with the test project the today view would launchappear automatically when the widget gets run from Xcode. With my actual project Im just getting the HomeScreen and have to pull down the Today view myself. So, really nothing at all happens regarding the widget while everything looks identical compared to the test project.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong Here is something I came across which might constitute the problem. The widget never gets launched really and gets stuck at Waiting to Attach in Xcodes Debug navigator. While other seemed to have had the same problem all potential solutions I found so far didt work for me.p  pstrongEDITstrong I noticed that when I add a Today widget as a target the binary is named strong.appstrong. All test projects I did the binary gets created as strong.appexstrong. All the information on the web suggests that it should be named strong.appexstrong really.

Negative 22 pI have writen a jQuery acript that waits for file input change and then takes all the files for upload in chunks. I am using the FileReader API to slice the file apart. Now I get console log every time a part of a file gets uploaded, the upload of last part is finished and the file processing on server starts and the when the processing finishes. What I need is to get the progress of the uploading in percentage and make a console log of it, for example. That would be easy if there was just one file, but since I am slicing the file into pieces and send every piece via ajax, I cant get it done.

Negative 22 pI occasionally use Mathematica to create animated graphs with parameters that I can change in real time as the animation runs. I find this is particularly effective to demonstrate the behavior of physical systems for students. An example Mathematica for one of the simpler animations isp  precodefreq  1006 lambda  38freq alpha  0  TLineLength  10lambda AmplitudePlus  2 PhasePlus  2Pi1800 AmplitudeMinus  AmplitudePlus0.5 PhaseMinus  2Pi1800 GammaL  0 Manipulate[Plot[AmplitudePlusCos[2Pifreq t  2Pilambdaz  PhasePlus]            Exp[alphaTLineLength  z], z, TLineLength, 0,             PlotRange gt AmplitudePlus, AxesLabel gt z [m], SuperPlus[V]], t,            0, 10freq, PhasePlus, 0, 2Pi, alpha, 0, 12lambda] codepre  pI would love to do this in ipython notebooks instead of Mathematica. I have tried using interact similar to the answers to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19731900ipythonmanipulatelikecommandthis questiona, but interact does not support animations as far as Ive been able to determine. Also, generated graphs have a lot of flicker as you move a slider widget to control a parameter. Ive also tried FuncAnimate, but have been entirely unsuccessful getting this to run inline in an ipython notebook which Im running on mac OS X 10.9. Even if I could get it to run, I wouldnt be able to change any parameters in real time as the animation runs. I would welcome advice or suggestions. p

Negative 22 pIm using the JSR 310 DateTime API in my application, and I need to parse and format military date times known as DTG or date time group.p  pThe format Im parsing looks like this using codeDateTimeFormattercodep  precodeddHHmmZ MMM yy  ie. 312359Z DEC 14, for new years eve 2014 codepre  pThis format is fairly easy to parse as described above. The problem arises when the dates contains a different time zone than Z Zulu time zone, same as UTCGMT, for example A Alpha, UTC100 or B Bravo, UTC200. See a hrefhttpwww.timeanddate.comtimezonesmilitaryMilitary time zonesa for the full list.p  pHow can I parse these time zones Or in other words, what can I put in the format above other than the literal Z to have it parse all zones correctly I have tried using codeddHHmmX MMM yycode, codeddHHmmZ MMM yycode and codeddHHmmVV MMM yycode, but none of them work all will throw codeDateTimeParseException Text 312359A DEC 14 could not be parsed at index 6code for the example above, when parsing. Using a single codeVcode in the format is not allowed codeIllegalArgumentExceptioncode when trying to instantiate codeDateTimeFormattercode.p  pEdit It seems that the symbol codezcode could have worked, if it wasnt for the issue below. p  pI should also mention that I have created a codeZoneRulesProvidercode with the all the named zones and correct offset. I have verified that these are registered correctly using the SPI mechanism, and my codeprovideZoneIdscode method is invoked as expected. Still wont parse. As a side issue Edit this now seems to be the main issue, single character time zone ids or regions other than Z are not  allowed by the API. p  pFor examplep  precodeZoneId alpha  ZoneId.ofA  boom codepre  pWill throw codeDateTimeException Invalid zone Acode without even accessing my rules provider to see if it exists.p  pIs this an oversight in the API Or am I doing something wrong p  hr  p Actually, Im using Java 7 and a hrefhttpwww.threeten.orgthreetenbpThreeTen Backporta, but I dont think that matters for this question.p  pPS My current workaround is to use 25 different codeDateTimeFormattercodes with literal zone id ie. codeddHHmmA MMM yycode, codeddHHmmB MMM yycode, etc, use a codeRegExpcode for extracting the zone id, and delegating to the correct formatter based on the zone. Zone ids in the provider are named Alpha, Bravo, etc to allow codeZoneId.of...code to find the zones. It works. But its not very elegant, and Im hoping theres a better solution.p

Negative 22 pLets say that I have a potentially largish array of 32bit numbers, perhaps several million entries long... is there a way to efficiently pick some number of the same bitwidth that does not appear anywhere in the array   Naively, I could just pick some  random number of the appropriate width, then examine the array and if it appears in the array, go back and pick another, but because of the number of elements in the array, the cost of potentially rescanning the array repeatedly is worrisome.  In practice, Im not sure how much of a problem this will be, since there will never be more than perhaps about 20 million entries, while the number of unique values is a few billion, so perhaps the overall likelihood of needing to rescan the array will happen so infrequently that it is not an issue.  Still, the fact that such an algorithm could potentially repeatedly rescan the array several times is troublesome to me, and I would ideally like a better solution, if one can be found.   Technically, the number does not even have to be random... a deterministic value is acceptable, the only requirement is that the number produced must be unique, and not already appear in the list.p  pSo... is there a runtime efficient way to generate a unique number, or is the random number approach I described above the only real way it can be done   With regards to timespace tradeoffs, I am more interested in speed, so a guaranteed On algorithm would be ideal, but I would probably not want any additional space requirements to be greater than about On log n.p  pThis will eventually be implemented in C, but a description of the algorithm in any language neutral terminology would be acceptable.p

Negative 22 pemEdit I solved my problem. See below.emp  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pIm new to NetBeans, and Im having a problem that involves loading a resource to my servlet application, which runs via NetBeans using Tomcat as the server. Everything is fine until I try to build my response using the Mustache template library in Java. At that point, an exception is thrownp  precodecom.github.mustachejava.MustacheException File not under root optcatalinabin codepre  pThis exception is thrown right at the point in my code where I try to compile the template file. I feed the path to the resource the template file to the codecompilecode method of the codeMustacheFactorycode. My code looks like thisp  precodeMustacheFactory mf  new DefaultMustacheFactory Mustache mustache  mf.compilegetFormTemplatePath  codepre  pstrongMy researchstrongp  pI took a look at the Mustache code, and as best as I can tell, here is whats happening. Mustache does a security check when it loads the resource, trying to ensure that the resource is under the applications root in the file system. Because NetBeans is working some kind of magic to run the code on the Tomcat server, while the projects code is actually somewhere else on the file system, Mustache thinks something fishy is going on. p  pIn other words, it can find the file it just doesnt like where its finding it. It seems like Mustache takes codeoptcatalinabincode as the applications root, while the template file is actually at a path more like codeNetBeansProjectsMyProjectWEBINFtemplatefile.mstcode.p  pThe Mustache code looks like this just so you can check my reasoningp  precodetry       Check to make sure that the file is under the file root or current directory.      Without this check you might accidentally open a security whole when exposing      mustache templates to end users.

What I have tried is googling variations of codeMustache NetBeans servlet File not under root exceptioncode and so forth, and nothing much comes up. Im guessing that I dont even know enough about NetBeans to know what key words I should be searching with.

Negative 22 pIm trying to add a strongpattern matching functionstrong to an existing scheme meta circular evaluator this is homework and Im a bit lost on the wording of the instructions.

What I can provide though is the calls made to animate the views and show the keyboard even if Im not sure its related  p  precodeOverride public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState      mView  inflater.inflateR.layout.addmessagelayout, null     mMessageEditText  AutoResizeEditText mView.findViewByIdR.id.messageEditText     mMessageEditText.setEnabledfalse     mMessageEditText.setEnableSizeCachefalse     mMessageEditText.setMovementMethodnull     mMessageEditText.setInterfacethis     mMessageEditText.setMinTextSizeTypedValue.applyDimensionTypedValue.COMPLEXUNITSP, MINSPTEXTSIZE, getResources.getDisplayMetrics     mMessageEditText.setMaxHeightint DisplayUtils.convertDpToPixelgetActivity.getApplicationContext, mMessageEditText.getMeasuredHeight     mMessageEditText.setLinesMAXLINESCOUNT     mMessageEditText.addTextChangedListenernew TextWatcher          Override         public void beforeTextChangedCharSequence s, int start, int count, int after              mLastMessage  mMessageEditText.getText.toString                   Override         public void onTextChangedCharSequence s, int start, int before, int count              if mMessageEditText.getLineCount gt MAXLINESCOUNT                  If user tries to type more text than expected                  mMessageEditText.setTextmLastMessage                 mMessageEditText.setSelectionmLastMessage.length                 Toast.makeTextgetActivity.getApplicationContext, Limit Reached, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                Override         public void afterTextChangedEditable s              mLastMessage  mMessageEditText.getText.toString             mMessageEditText.invalidate                    mAddMessageButton  RelativeLayout mView.findViewByIdR.id.rlAddMessage     mAddMessageButton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              setupAnimations             animZoomIn                    mCardLayout  LinearLayout mView.findViewByIdR.id.rearMainCardLayout     return mView   private void setupAnimations      mPivotX  mMessageEditText.getPivotX  mCardLayout.getMeasuredHeight     mPivotY  mMessageEditText.getPivotY  mCardLayout.getMeasuredWidth      mZoomIn  new ScaleAnimation1.0f, 1.3f, 1.0f, 1.3f, mPivotX, mPivotY     mZoomIn.setDuration1000     mZoomIn.setFillAftertrue      mSlideUp  new TranslateAnimation0.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f     mSlideUp.setDuration1000     mSlideUp.setFillAftertrue      mEnterAnimation  new AnimationSettrue     mEnterAnimation.setInterpolatornew LinearInterpolator     mEnterAnimation.addAnimationmZoomIn     mEnterAnimation.addAnimationmSlideUp     mEnterAnimation.setFillAftertrue     mEnterAnimation.setAnimationListenernew Animation.AnimationListener          Override         public void onAnimationStartAnimation animation               mBeginX  mMessageEditText.getLeft             mBeginY  mMessageEditText.getTop                   Override         public void onAnimationEndAnimation animation              mMessageEditText.setPressedtrue      EditText will get highlighted             mMessageEditText.setFocusabletrue             mMessageEditText.setFocusableInTouchModetrue             mMessageEditText.setTextIsSelectabletrue             mMessageEditText.requestFocus             mMessageEditText.invalidate              mMessageEditText.setEnabledtrue             showKeyboardgetActivity.getApplicationContext, mMessageEditText                   Override         public void onAnimationRepeatAnimation animation            mZoomOut  new ScaleAnimation1.3f, 1.0f, 1.3f, 1.0f, mPivotX, mPivotY     mZoomOut.setDuration1000     mZoomOut.setFillAftertrue      mSlideDown  new TranslateAnimation100.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f     mSlideDown.setDuration1000     mSlideDown.setFillAftertrue      mExitAnimation  new AnimationSettrue     mExitAnimation.setInterpolatornew LinearInterpolator     mExitAnimation.addAnimationmZoomOut     mExitAnimation.addAnimationmSlideDown     mExitAnimation.setFillAftertrue     mExitAnimation.setAnimationListenernew Animation.AnimationListener          Override         public void onAnimationStartAnimation animation           Override         public void onAnimationEndAnimation animation              mMessageEditText.invalidate                   Override         public void onAnimationRepeatAnimation animation         private void animZoomIn      mCardLayout.startAnimationmEnterAnimation   private void animZoomOut      mCardLayout.startAnimationmExitAnimation   private static void closeKeyboardContext c, IBinder windowToken      InputMethodManager manager  InputMethodManagerc.getSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE     manager.hideSoftInputFromWindowwindowToken, 0   private static void showKeyboardContext c, EditText text      InputMethodManager manager  InputMethodManager c.getSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE     manager.showSoftInputtext, InputMethodManager.SHOWIMPLICIT  codepre

Negative 22 pI am trying to make a program to construct a Maze a classic exercise in Java and I want to my method to generate the maze to recieve a seed for the aleatory number generator that is used to generate this. This is required because I want the program to generate the same maze everytime I enter the same seed. But, with some seed values, more values looks like to have more probability than others. p  pI mean, suppose that I set a random object with a given seed and use it to generate integers between [0, 4 and this is used as criteria to build the maze. The sequence generated is so characteristic that the maze is just too easy. Is I just dont set any seed, a good maze is generated. The integers part are just an example. I could use an uniform and divide it 4 regions [0, 0,25, [0,25, 0.5, [0.5, 0.75, [0.75, 1p  pIs there a way to modify that seed so that the behavior of the random number generator will be the same for the same seed and mantain the good mixture of the numbers I mean, how can I generate the same numbers setting a seed such that they are evenly distributed in this intervalsp  pThanksp

Negative 22 pI set up a system to filter the twitter real time stream sample.  Obviously, the database writes are too slow to keep up with anything more complex than a couple of lowvolume keywords.  I implemented djangorq as a simple queuing system to push the tweets off into a redis based queue as they came in, and that works great.  My issue is on the other side.  The context to this question is I have a system thats running right now, with 1.5m tweets for analysis, and another 375,000 queued through redis.  At current rates of performance, its going to take me 3 days to catch up, if I turn off the streams, which I dont want to.  If I maintain the streams, then itll take about a month, on my last estimates. p  pThe database has a couple of million rows across two main tables now, and the writes are very slow.  The optimal number of rqworkers seems to be four, and thats averaging out at 1.6 queue tasks per second.  Code of whats being enqueued below.  I thought that maybe the issue was the opening of DB connections for every new queue task, so put CONNMAXAGE to 60, but that hasnt improved anything.   p  pHaving just tested this on localhost, I got in excess of 13 writessecond, on a Macbook 2011, with Chrome, etc etc running, but there are only a few thousand rows in that database, which leads me to believe its size related.  There are a couple of codegetorcreatecode commands Im using see below, which could be slowing things down, but cant see any other way through using them  I need to check if the user exists, and I need to check if the tweet already exists I could possibly, I suspect, move the latter to a tryexcept, on the basis that tweets coming in from the live stream shouldnt already exist, for obvious reasons. Would I get much performance gain out of that As this is running still, Im keen to optimise the code a bit and get some fastermore efficient workers in there so I can catch up Would running a prevetting worker to batch things up work i.e. so I can batch create users that dont exist, or something similar  p  pIm running a 4 Core8Gb Ram droplet on digital ocean, so feel this is some pretty terrible performance, and presumably code related.

Negative 22 pI have an activity that gets data from a web service. The output of the web service consists of multiple sets of one web URL and some text. The URL points to an image. Each set is displayed by creating a linear layout which contains an imageview and textview. So, for 200 sets, I would have 200 layouts, 200 imageviews, and 200 textiews. I know that a list view would be a better solution, but Ive gone too far in the project to change this now.p  pCurrently,  I download all images before the activity is displayed. I download around 200 images and in the future this might rise to more than 1000. I would like to download the images only when the imageview appears on screen. The approach I am thinking of is creating some listener or event so that once the the imageview or layout appears on screen, the download starts. I searched a lot for this but could not find a good solution. strongMy problem is creating the listener not starting the download.strongp  pSome solutions suggested lazy load but this would still mean all images are loaded which would not be appropriate for users who have limited download capacity.p  pEdit I do not want to load all images, only the ones that appear on screen. And every time the user scrolls, the new imageview that appear on screen also start downloading.p

In general, I will have two maps for both the flow so we will have different values for those two maps for PROCESS flow as compared to DEVICE flow.p  precodepublic enum FlowType      PROCESS, DEVICE  codepre  pI have a background thread running every 5 minutes which gets the data from each FLOW url and populate those two maps whenever there is an update. When the application is started for the first time, then it will update the mapping and after that, it will update the mapping 78 months afterwards. And it doesnt mean that both the flow mapping will change at the same time. It might be possible PROCESS mapping has change but not DEVICE mapping.p  precodepublic class DataScheduler       private RestTemplate restTemplate  new RestTemplate     private static final String PROCESSURL  httpprocessflowurl     private static final String DEVICEURL  httpdeviceflowurl     private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler  Executors.newScheduledThreadPool1      public void startScheduleTask          scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRatenew Runnable              public void run                  try                      callService                  catch Exception ex                       logging exception here using logger                                       , 0, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES           public void callService throws Exception          String url  null         MapltFlowType, Stringgt holder  new HashMapltFlowType, Stringgt         for FlowType flow  FlowType.values              try                  url  getURLflow                 String response  restTemplate.getForObjecturl, String.class                 holder.putflow, response              catch RestClientException ex                   logging exception here using logger                                     parseResponseholder           private void parseResponseMapltFlowType, Stringgt responses throws Exception          MapltFlowType, Mappinggt partitionMapper  new HashMapltFlowType, Mappinggt         boolean update  false          for Map.EntryltFlowType, Stringgt responseEntry  responses.entrySet              FlowType flow  responseEntry.getKey             String response  responseEntry.getValue              MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping  new HashMapltgt             MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping  new HashMapltgt              if DataUtils.isEmptyresponse                  try Scanner scanner  new Scannerresponse                      boolean hasProcess  Boolean.parseBooleanscanner.nextLine.trim.substringHASPROCESSLEN                     if hasProcess                          update  true                           some code                             partitionMapper.putflow, PartitionHolder.createMapping                                             primaryMapping, secondaryMapping                                                                      if there is any update, then only update the mappings, otherwise not.         if update              PartitionHolder.setMappingspartitionMapper                codepre  pAs you can see above, it updates the mapping by calling codesetMappingscode method if any of the flow mapping has been updated. p  pAnd below is my PartitionHolder classp  precodepublic class PartitionHolder       public static class Mapping          public final MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping         public final MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping          public MappingMapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping,                 MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping              this.primaryMapping  primaryMapping             this.secondaryMapping  secondaryMapping                    getters here           private static final AtomicReferenceltMapltFlowType, Mappinggtgt mappingsHolder  new AtomicReferenceltMapltFlowType, Mappinggtgt     private static final CountDownLatch hasInitialized  new CountDownLatch1      public static Mapping getFlowMappingFlowType flowType          try              hasInitialized.await             return mappingsHolder.get.getflowType          catch InterruptedException e              Thread.currentThread.interrupt             throw new IllegalStateExceptione                    public static void setMappingsMapltFlowType, Mappinggt newMapData          mappingsHolder.setnewMapData         hasInitialized.countDown           public static Mapping createMapping             MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping,             MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping          return new MappingprimaryMapping, secondaryMapping       codepre  pNow this is the way I am using codePartitionHoldercode class from the main thread.

In below code codedataKey.getFlowTypecode can be PROCESS OR DEVICE.p  precodeOverride public DataResponse call throws Exception      Mapping mappings  PartitionHolder.getFlowMappingdataKey.getFlowType      use mappings object here  codepre  pNow in my above code as you can see, I am updating the mapping by calling codesetMappingscode method if any of the flow mapping has been updated. There are two scenarios which can happenp  ul liWhen the application is started for the first time, then it works fine without any issues, since it will update the mapping for both the flow. li liNow second time, lets say for PROCESS flow, mapping has been updated but for DEVICE flow mapping has not been updated, then in that case it will update the overall mapping by calling codesetMappingscode method which will overwrite codemappingsHoldercode. Problem with this approach is, for DEVICE flow I will start getting empty mapping when I will call codegetFlowMappingcode since it overwrote DEVICE mapping to empty  maps. Rightli ul  pHow can I avoid my second problem Is there any better way to solve this problem instead of using Map and key as the FlowType Do I need to use Factory pattern here to solve this problem or any other better wayp

Negative 22 pWhats an easy way to detect a file has changed and update it automaticallyp  pFor example if I have a jscss file that I just uploaded, Id like the server to detect I uploaded new jscss files and minify them automatically right then and there.p  pEDIT Ive tried minifying at run time and found out its not efficient. Its interesting to note, that the file was minified for anyone requesting the file which was an overhead in itself and it was actually faster to not minify the file for delivery.p  pIdeally, the file should be minified within a few seconds of upload. Instead of a constantly polling system, is there an event based system out there that I could look intop  pEDIT I used mikhailov answer and added the following to the incron filep  precodevarwwwlaravelpublicjsmain.js INMODIFY yuicompressor o varwwwlaravelpublicjsmain.min.js varwwwlaravelpublicjsmain.js  codepre

Negative 22 pIm creating an app which needs to show a series of codeBitmapcodes of a videos frames. The app uses codeMediaCodeccode to decode a video into a number of frames and gets codeBitmapcodes of each frame to display them on codeImageViewcode.p  pThe problem is that each codeBitmapcodes size is about 23MB strongFrame size is 1280 x 720strong, the size of 720p video. so that when the number of Bitmap is above 6065, the app crashes due to the lack of memory. In order to avoid this problem Ive been implementing the D tour algorithm which loads only codeBitmapcodes that need to be displayed right now or soon. Basically Ive been trying these methods.p  h31. Load all codeBitmapcodes in advance.h3  pIts fast enough to meet my need but as mentioned the app crashes when the number of codeBitmapcodes exceed 6065.p  h32. When extracting frames, save each frame into a codeJPEGcode file and load specific codeJPEGcodes into codeBitmapcodes when needed.h3  pI used a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidgraphicsBitmapFactory.htmldecodeFilejava.lang.String relnofollowcodeBitmapFactory.decodeFilecodea to load a codeBitmapcode from a codeJPEGcode, but it was slow.p  h33. When extracting frames, save whole frames into an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiMotionJPEG relnofollowcodeMJPEGcodea file and load specific frame technically the byte array into codeBitmapcodes when needed.h3  pI thought if I load codeBitmapcode from the byte array itself the performance might be better. So when extracting frames, I created another metadata file containing information of each frames byte indices and used that information to load codeBitmapcodes when needed. [codeBitmapFactory.decodeByteArraycode]a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidgraphicsBitmapFactory.htmldecodeByteArraybyte[] relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidgraphicsBitmapFactory.htmldecodeByteArraybyte[]a, int, int is used. I could see a slight improvement in speed but it is still insufficient.p  pWhat else can I try to boost up codeBitmapcode loading in this situationp

When I apply rotation to the dataLabel symbols, via codedataLabel.attr rotation point.y code in a code.eachcode loop, they rotate, but end up all wavy instead of along a horizontal line.

Negative 22 pWhen dealing with an element that contains text, you can set the text to attributed to allow for more customization. But this never actually works. There is the little font icon that opens a window where you can select a font, a color, bolditalicunderlined, font size, etc. Changing anything in this window does nothing at least for me, tested on multiple macs and multiple ios devices over the past two years.br There are some smart solutions as suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25099736addingunderlinetouilabelattributedstringfromthestoryboardfailsherea for example. But aside from having to open external software just to edit some text in a button, these solutions are not exactly complete.
