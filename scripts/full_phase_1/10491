But when they enter matching passwords and resubmit the form a second time, the csrftoken contains the token value but requestcsrftoken is blank.  This was confirmed by the fact that request.POST[csrfmiddlewaretoken] is not in the request.POST dictionary when the user resubmits the form.  I dont understand why this is happening.p  pThis form worked perfectly well in Django 1.6 but its stopped working in 1.8 or possibly 1.7.  I looked through the 1.7 and 1.8 release notes and didnt see any changes to the CSRF functionality.  I also read the template docs that pertain to CSRF and didnt see anything new there.  Doing an online search on this error didnt turn up anything either.p  pI suspect that some of you will suggest that I use the djangoregistrationredux library.  I dont think I can use it due to my registration workflow.  You see, after the user registers on this form, theyre redirected first to a page when they enter their user profile, then to a page where they can upload a photo, and then to a page to review and approve their profile and photo.  After that, theyre forwarded to my payment processor.  Theyre only truly registered with a valid account if my payment processor tells me their payment method has been approved.p  pThanks.p

Negative 10491 pWhen you use a standard Windows file open dialog using GetOpenFileName, the shell will load various DLLs that it requires to display the file list, including custom ones.p  pIn my application, I found that the DLL that TortoiseCVS uses to draw overlays on the icons was calling GdiPlusShutdown, and so some time after displaying a file open dialog, the TortoiseCVS DLL would be unloaded, it would shut down GDI and my graphics functions would all failp  pIt seems quite bad that basically any old DLL could be loaded by my application at any time and start doing random things to its state.  The workaround in my case was quite simple  just restart GDI if I detect that its been shut down.  However had this happened on a clients machine where I couldnt debug it, it would have been a lot more challenging to figure out what was going on.p  pCan anybody offer any insight  What could I do to stop this from happeningp

Negative 10491 pI have an Excel spreadsheet provided as a report, when really its more of a database, with the row number acting as primary key.  I need to compare some columns in this set with a different set of records from an Access 2007 database.  To make matters more complicated, this needs to be done automatically, without user input, on a regular schedule.  p  pWhat is the best way to get the data out of the spreadsheet, and what is the best way to run the comparison.  As for getting data out of the spreadsheet, ACEDAO seems the best option, since this is Excel 2007, but MSDN has no information I could find on how to query Excel using DAOACEDAO, only to export to Excel using DAOACEDAO.  As for running the comparison, beyond comparing each column of each entry, I cant figure out a better way to do it.p

Then you again use the command line to commit the changes until version 0.10, when you can just use TortoiseHG to commit.p  pstrongUpdating working directory to an earlier revisionstrong  This seems to work pretty normally with TortoiseHG and doesnt seem to require use of any DOS commands. To actually work with the earlier revision in Visual Studio, you will need to do a codeSynchronizePushcode operation to put the older version of the library projects back into the codeLibrariesProjectXcode folder.p  pAs much as I like TortoiseHG for simple tasks, its probably better to write batch files for frequently used subrepo operations especially updating.p  pHope this helps someone in the future.

Negative 10491 pIm trying to change the destination of a merge module at run time...p  pLet me explain I have a merge module, which its destination is set to the [SystemFolder] folder.p  pAnd I have a lot of MSI projects point to this one merge module, all pointing the merge module Component destination to Use merge modules default destination.p  pThe Issue One of the MSI Projects needs to install the merge module to the Common File location not the systyem32 folder.p  pSo if I change the merge module Component destination in the MSI project to [CommonFileFolder] nothing happens because merge module destination is still set to [SystemFolder]p  pOr, if I change the merge module destination to be [TARGETDIR] and then change my merge module Component destination in the MSI project to [CommonFileFolder], then that works fine. But then all my other MSI projects will then install the merge module to the root drive because the other MSI projects are still pointing the merge module Component destination to Use merge modules default destination.p  pI cant do these two things I dont want to change every single MSI project to either [SystemFolder] or [CommonFileFolder].p  pAnd I also dont want to create two identical merge modules one pointing to [SystemFolder] and the other point to [CommonFileFolder], so I only have to change the one MSI projectp  pIs they a way I could change the merge module destination if the MSI project is point the merge module to Use merge modules default destinationp  pFor example If TARGETDIR  Use merge modules default destination then set the TARGETDIR  [SystemFolder] Else use the [TARGETDIR]p  pOr is there another way I could fix thisp  pThanks BillyBobLeep

I have created very simple test source files in a new, empty folder. brbrHere is one examplep  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt int main int argc, char argv       char    msg[4]       allocate 4 bytes on the stack      strcpy msg, hello world       overflow       printf sn, msg      return 0  codepre  pUPDATE here is my command line sequence br gcc g .mytest.c o mytestbr gdb .mytestbrbrp  pUPDATE I have previously turned on MALLOCCHECK1 in order to test the stack overflow problem in the code. And this works so I get a stack trace. But the stack trace is no different whether I include the debug info or not. What I expected to see with the debugger information was a line number of a file for where the problem occurred under GDB. However this doesnt happen.p

Because right now, I use write to save my list into a file, and when I try to load it back into memory I get strings rather than real lists. is there a way to convert them back to lists after loading or should I change the way I save my lists into a file.Please note that I dont want to use Pickle. Thanks  EDIT my problem with pickle is that I have to add my lists step by step in different part of the code.Thus, I dont have all the lists at once so I can pickle them. This is the problem that I had.It gives me wrong answer, I guess it is because pickle requires all the info in one place and adds them to file at once.   I have only integers in my lists.p
Negative 10491 pThis is going to be a long post. I would like to have suggestions if any on the procedure I am following. I want the best method to print line numbers next to each CRLFterminatedline in a richtextbox. I am using C with .NET. I have tried using ListView but it is inefficient when number of lines grow. I have been successful in using Graphics in custom control to print the line numbers and so far I am happy with the performance.p  pBut as the number of lines grow to 50K to 100K the scrolling is affected badly. I have overridden WndProc method and handling all the messages to call the linenumber printing only when required. Overriding OnContentsResized and OnVScroll make redundant calls to the printing method.p  pNow the line number printing is fine when number of lines is small say upto 10K with which I am fine as it is rare need to edit a file with 10000 lines but I want to remove the limitation.p  pFew Observationsp  ul liNumber of lines displayed in the richtexbox is constant 1. So, the performance difference should be due to large text and not because I am using Graphics painting.li liPainting line numbers for large text is slower when compared to small filesli ul  pNow the Pseudo Codep  precodeFIRSTLINENUMBER  textBox.GetFirstVisibleLineNumber LASTLINENUMBER  textBox.GetLastVisibleLineNUmber forloopfromfirsttolastlinenumber      Y  textBox.GetYPositionOfLineNumbercurrentlinenumber     graphicspaintlinenumbercurrentlinenumber, Y  codepre  pI am using emGetCharIndexFromPositionem and loop through the RichTextBox.Lines to find the line number in both the functions which get the line numbers. To get Y position I am using emGetPositionFromCharIndexem to get the emPointem struct. p  pAll the above RichTextBox methods seem to be of On, which eats up the performance. Correct me if I am wrong.p  pI have decided to use a binarytree to store the line numbers to improve the search perfomance when searching for line number by char index. I have an idea of getting a datastructure which takes On construction time, Onlgn worstcaseupdate, and Olgn search.p  pIs this approach worth the effort Is there any other approach to solve the problem If required I am ready to write the control from scratch, I just want it to be lightweight and fast. p

Negative 10491 pI try to implement a singleton pattern with the capability of passing arguments to the instructor. For the singleton pattern I want to create a base class. The main problem with this is that not all derived classes have the same amount of parameters. For the singleton base class I have this so farp  precodeabstract class Singleton             Function construct       Description the function which creates the object.           protected function construct                private final function clone               public static function getInstance              args  funcgetargs         static instance  null          return instance  instance    new static           codepre  pSo far, this works, but I cant pass arguments to the constructor with this. Of course I can directly pass the args array to the constructor, but I dont want to have to unfold the array in each constructor of the derived classes, I want to be able to pass the arguments as normal parameters.p  pIve tried several things already I tried using calluserfuncarray, but I couldnt figure out how to construct an object with this function if its possible at all, and Ive also tried using the ReflectionClass. The problem with the ReflectionClass was that this class cant access the constructor since the constructor is protected.p  pSo does anyone has any ideas for me how to solve thisp  pps. sorry if Im acting difficult, but I just try to find the best solution and understand that solution.p

Negative 10491 pWhen I place a ListBox inside a ScrollViewer, if I do not define a Height attribute for the ListBox, it doesnt scroll aside from bouncing up and down a bit, so elements off the screen are inaccessible. If I set the Height attribute on the ListBox to the actual height it takes up on the screen, it scrolls perfectly. If I dont get the Height exactly right, it doesnt scroll properly, e.g. I might not be able to reach the bottom elements in the list.p  pWhen placing other elements in the single column LayoutRoot Grid above and below the ScrollViewerListBox, I set the RowDefinition.HeightAuto on all rows except the ScrollViewers, which gets . The Grid appears to properly allocate space accordingly. Except now I dont know a priori how much space the ScrollViewerListBox takes up. p  pPart A Why should I have to set the Height on the ListBox, doesnt its virtual height vary with the number of elements p  pPart B It appears I have to manually lay out the Grid row heights, then manually redo them if a fontsize or other style change is called for.

Negative 10491 pIn certain scenarios I want to forcefully logout a user. Im using Spring Security and the only way I know how to do this is to forwardredirect to logout or whatever URL Spring listens to for logout attempts. Since in theory a user could stop his browser from following a redirect, Id rather do a forward to the logout URL, as its very important that the logout logic is carried out. Since Spring will always do a redirect after a unsuccessful logout, Im wondering if this will be a problem. So, in short, is redirecting allowed after the request has already been forwarded, or will it result in an IllegalStateExceptionp

Negative 10491 pSo I have this codeUricode object which contains an address, something like codehttplocalhost1000blahblahblahcode. I need to change the port number and leave all other parts of the address intact. Lets say I need it to be codehttplocalhost1080blahblahblahcode.p  pThe codeUricode objects are pretty much immutable, so I can access the port number through the codePortcode property, but its readonly.

If thats the only way, I really hope that its already implemented by someone and there are some helpers out there maybe I didnt find any thoughp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 10491 pEven using the unobtrusive ajax library, the scripts loaded into this page from the Login.cshtml file are loaded when the form is submitted and I do not know how to prevent this. An even stranger effect is when an onclick event is applied to any element, when the form is submitted the script gets executed by the number of times the element was clicked.p  pstrongEditstrong On further testing, I realized that the unobtrusive ajax library basically reloads the whole page inside the UpdateTargetId element, which is VERY counterproductive.

Negative 10491 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq7589144866022this questiona, I was facing an issue where I was writing an update for a deployed application to bring the database up to date with the newer version we are deploying. Basic outline as followsp  blockquote   ul   liBegan with currently deployed version of applicationli   liAdded new functionality that used existing databaseli   liAdded new database tables and relationshipsli   liAdded new functionality that depended on the new databse structureli   liTesting complete, ready for deploymentli   ul blockquote  pThe issue here is that the currently deployed application has been in use for a few months and has a lot of data that would need to be preserved, so simply replacing the old with the new was not viable at least not for the database, but of course it works for the code. So I used the following steps to write a script in SQL for the updated version of the application to run the first time it starts up to make the necessary changes to the database without touching existing data aside from populating the new tablesp  blockquote   ul   liUse VS2010s Generate database from model functionality to create a .sql the model was originally created using the Generate model from database functionalityli   liRemove all parts of the .sql that act on the existing tables, except for those that add FKs between new and old tablesli   liUse the resulting script to build the new databaseli   ul blockquote  pSounds pretty clean and done, right Wrong. The mapping from the model to the database was all wrong for the new tables. Long story short, the database that generated the model had tables named in the plural and the mapping was correct and the application worked, and the database generated by the model created tables in the plural identical names to what the tables where the DB generated the model, but the model did not map to them. The solution ended up being to change the script to name the tables in the singular, and then everything worked flawlessly.p  pWhat happened here The code remained untouched, no changes were made to the model, and the old tables continued to work fine the entire time, yet somewhere in the process ofp  blockquote   ul   liGenerate scriptli   liDelete new tables and constraints those that dont yet exist in the deployed versionli   liRun script to readd the tablesli   ul blockquote  pthe mapping decided to be to singularly named tables User instead of Users, Address instead of Addresses, etc.p  pCan anyone explain to me howwhy this would happen this wayp

Negative 10491 pI have a drawRect method that is rather slow 100200ms.  To save time, I need to cache the results.  I am doing the actual caching like thisp  precode some code to check if caching would be desirable goes here.  If it is desirable, then UIGraphicsBeginImageContextviewSize CGContextRef c  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext [view.layer renderInContext c] UIImage image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext [self.cachedImageArray addObjectimage] UIGraphicsEndImageContext codepre  pThe caching itself can take up to 40ms.  This is still easily worth it.  But the caching has to wait until everything is rendered, or it will come out wrong.  Additionally, the caching is a lowpriority task.  Once everything is displayed, it is possible that other things will still be going on, and if so, the caching can wait.  But since it uses UIKit, it has to be on the main thread.p  pRather than putting in some arbitrary delay, is there a bulletproof way to wait like thisp
Negative 10491 pSo after two days of googling incessantly and apparently asking the wrong questions, I think I have figured out a way to word it so I get the response Im looking for.p  pI have a Project Management application, written in MVC3.  Sometimes, the users have to attach large files and upload them to the applications.  100200 mb is typical.  The problem of course is that this is currently handled synchronously, and varying network speeds mean that the application can be completely blocked for 10 minutes to an hour if someones on a slow connection.  FTP is NOT an option here my hands are tied by our network guys on that one.p  pSo I am looking for a way to do the following workflowp  ul liuser clicks Upload Fileli liuser selects File to uploadli liuser clicks Go or whatever buttonli liApplication says your file is being uploaded.  You will be notified when its completeli liuser continues to use the application as normal.li ul  pSome things to be aware of  I already have an internal messaging system implemented.  So when I say that the app will notify the user when its complete  all it needs to do is insert a new message into the queue.  It DOES NOT need to notify the users current screen or anything like that  so Im not worried about a return value of any kind.  I also have a background Error log implemented, so I can insert a message into the log if something goes wrong and again  inform the user via the internal messaging system.p  pSo I am stumped on how to implement this.  I thought an Async Controller was the right way to go, but if I understand all the stuff Ive been seeing  its not.  Feel free to correct me.  I implemented a version using Async but when addressing the one problem it had, I was informed that I was doing it wrong anyway. p  pSo uh...help  Im all ears.p

Negative 10491 pIm writing an iOS game Using UIView, which has a randomly generated 2D city. I need attacking A.I., that will take an intelligent path to find the player without colliding with buildings.

Negative 10491 pHi to all Qt Modelview programming gurus here in Stackoverflow. The project I am working on requires me to define a QAbstractItemModelderived model for XML data. I had previously asked a question here when I ran into a problem during implementation of this model  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7253232qsortfilterproxymodelcrasheswhendeletingarowfromthesourcemodelviatheQSortFilterProxyModel crashes when deleting a row from the source model via the source model functionap  pThe model is currently  doing its job pretty well in the application except for some performance issues which I do not know how to solve. One of the functions in this  application is to add Frame element xml nodes by setting the Max Num and Rand numbers. Each Frame element will have both Num  and Rand numbers running from 0 to MaxNum  1 and 0 to MaxRand1 respectively. Furthermore I will need to add a child Parameter element for Rand0 th and RandMaxRand1 th element each. An abbreviated illustration is as followsp  precodeFor Max Num100, Max Rand50  ltFrame Num0 Rand0gt   ltParameter Valuefalsegt  ltFramegt  ltFrame Num0 Rand1gt  ltFrame Num0 Rand2gt  ...  ltFrame Num0 Rand48gt  ltFrame Num0 Rand49gt   ltParameter Valuetruegt  ltFramegt  ltFrame Num1 Rand0gt   ltParameter Valuefalsegt  ltFramegt  ltFrame Num1 Rand1gt  ltFrame Num1 Rand2gt  ...  ltFrame Num1 Rand48gt  ltFrame Num1 Rand49gt   ltParameter Valuetruegt  ltFramegt  ... ltFrame Num99 Rand0gt   ltParameter Valuefalsegt  ltFramegt  ltFrame Num99 Rand1gt  ltFrame Num99 Rand2gt  ...  ltFrame Num99 Rand48gt  ltFrame Num99 Rand49gt   ltParameter Valuetruegt  ltFramegt codepre  pThe application works fine when both MaxNum and MaxRand are small i.e. total number of Frame elements around 50. However, when the element count goes beyond 500 or so, the adding of Frame elements via QAbstractItemModel functions becomes painfully and exponentially slow. The GUI freezes for a long period of time, to the point where I gave up waiting most of the time.p  pstrongMAJOR UPDATEstrongp  pI have found out what is causing the slowdown when inserting a large number of, say 1000 items into my model. I was calling both insertRowrow, parent and setData once per item inserted, which turns out to be very expensive due to the signals emitted inside these functions.p  pI have modified the code to insertRowsrow, 1000, parent instead and defined a new silentSetData that does not emit a dataChangedcurrIndex, currIndex. I have also included a new public function called notifyDataChangesstartRow, endRow, parentIndex which in turns emit the dataChanged signal once for the given range of data. All is fine but now the caller class will need to explicitly call notifyDataChanges after the whole set of data is inserted.p  pNow I am wondering why is emitting dataChanged signals so expensive Has anyone tried other means to overcome this problem when insertingchanging large number of items in the model at oncep

Negative 10491 pIve read a lot of discussions about web site vs web applications in asp.netp  pThe way we work in my team 10 programmers, we use the project type web site, and for our dev environment, we just copy the source code aspx  .cs to the server. This way, all the programmers can be doing changes at the same time.. and the server does the build dynamically. .....for the prod environment, they build the applicationp  pNow, Im starting a new project, and I decided to use web application the main reason was the web config transform option.. I soon realized that as far as I know it forces you to do a buildpublish of the web app to the server with every change... which is not a big problem strongif Im the only one working on this projectstrong...p  pBut, now Im wondering, whats going to happen if more programmers needs to work on this new project at the same timep  pAny advise or similar situationp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pwere using Visual Source Safe... but only for keeping track of the older versions not for builds... Im familiar with Subversion... but.. unfortunately, I dont take the decision on what we should use.. and I dont think theyre willing to change p  pThanks everyone for your answers...p
Negative 10491 pVisual Studio 2010 has the ability to run test scripts using different browser profiles. For a specific scenario with two scripts script1 and script2 you can configure the Browser Mix to run 50 of your scripts as IE7 users and 50 of your scripts as mobile users. p  pThe problem I am facing is that the mobile and desktop versions of a web site are completely different. So the same script that is recorded for the desktop will not run for the mobile. I cannot see any configuration or way to force script1 to only run as IE7 and script2 to only run as safari for iphone.p  pThis is possible with many other performance tools but I fear given the simplicity of MSVS Load testing it may not be possible. Does anyone know if this is possible, the only way I can think that it might be is if somehow in each script I can override the browser mix settingp

Negative 10491 pHow do I get WCF to propagate the properties of Trace.CorrelationManager when it uses a different thread for the same operationp  pI know that WCF doesnt guarantee thread affinity. So basically one thread can start a request and a different thread may finish it. When I reproed this behavior, I see that the first thread has the two properties Trace.Correlation.ActivityId and Trace.Correlation.LogicalOperationStack properly set. WCF finished the operation with a different thread but the properties were not propagated.p  pTo work around this, I might have to abandon the use of the CorrelationManager and will probably have to store the ActivityId in the OperationContext which I know is propagated to the new thread Please correct me if I am wrong here. I dont want to do this, since its more work of course and not as elegant as using that single property.p  pAny other ideas on how I can work around this Can I tell WCF to propagte this for me somehowp  pThanks, Mohammedp

Negative 10491 pI am trying to develop a WebClient based Online game using GWT.p  pThe game mechanics work quite fine by now and Id really like to go on with my next step in my development plan, but now I am stuck with a simple encodingdecoding function I created to store my data for the client into a string.p  pThe steps I took are not that complicated. During runtime, my server creates ImageStates of the game Objects to be drawn on a Canvas on my client. Each ImageState contains a number of Layers, which contain Details of what has to be drawn where at what specific time and so on.p  pI tried ObjectInputOutputStream, combined with GZipCompression and ByteInputStreams, but I could not find any GWT implementation of the first two so I had to think about another solution and came across gwtlzma.p  pMy goal is to encode those details into a single string, compress it on the server, send the compressed Data to the client, decompress and decode it there so it can be read by the client. To do so, I created an encoding and a decoding functionp  pThe encoderp  precodepublic static String encodeImageStateContainerHashMapltString,HashMapltLong,ImageStategtgt imageStateContainer

definitely say that the string generated by it is always valid, the string at which I get this error is complete as well. There must be something wrong with my decoding function, but I have no idea what it could be.p  pAs I said, the first three cycles are encoded and decoded properly and the data to encode did not change dramatically. There is no way that the encoded string could lead to having a String array smaller than 4 elements. Basically, this error cant exist as far as I understand my code.p  pI think it could be some kind of memory allocation problem that prevents the string from being split properly, but thats just an idea of a clueless programmer.p  pAny help is deeply appreciatedp
Negative 10491 pNOTE I am not a native English speaker. Please excuse any grammar mistakes.p  pI developed a simple game where theres a shooter on the left and enemies coming from the right.. Very simple.p  pThe project is almost finished, it works perfectly, but now i have some doubts about the game loop management.p  pI scheduled the enemies appearing from the right giving the scheduler a interval, and its ok, but i managed the movement of enemies from right to left with a simple ccMoveTo action, and i repeat it works perfectly. The problem is that i read something about render the sprites in every frame delegating this operation to a scheduled method that runs one time per frame.. p  pBetter i read about to not use an Action to move sprites, but rerender them frame by frame simulating the movement in a scheduled method called with the  160 frequency, the fps frequency and i read that this implementation could prevent some differences of stability in different hardware systems..p  pWhat i ask isp  ul liis that the right way to proceedli liis that an old design pattern that is obsolete with Cocos2D and this would mean that using the ccMoveTo actions is completely perfectli lior are both implementations correct at the same level li ul  pEDITp  pthe same technique should be used for the animations toop
Negative 10491 pWhat were wanting to do is use typical POCO objects over a service. Now, I know that services are really made to provide functionality ala carte, but really, the issue that were trying to address here is achieving the same usability that you get with a class library POCO functionality like attributes, constructors, and behaviors in a compiled library along with the benefit of having a centralized, reusable assembly that is called on the fly. That way, we can build the libraries, and redeploy it to ONE location and all apps that reference it will be updated. p  pIt would seem that WCF doesnt really support this, and I can understand why. In most cases, people tend to scoff condescendingly and ask why would you do that. Well, Ive answered that here. So what Im really asking is where should look into to achieve this sort of central class library I dont feel like services are the answer, but I need to achieve a central class library that can be accessed like a service. This way, an update of that class library would transparently affect all applications that reference it vs. having to rereference it in every app. Does this make sense TIAp  pUPDATE Just thought about it. Would it be stupid to just add the assembly to the application servers GACp

Negative 10491 pWorking from a video file, I scan through the video frame by frame until I find a face using the OpenCV Haar frontal face cascade.

I just do a basic run through the video with the same eye and mouth detectors without Camshift, then they detect the eyes and mouth although often detecting mouths as eyes and vice versa, but still much better detection than my Camshifttracked ROI approach. p  pThis is counter to my expectations  shouldnt limiting search within an ROI of a known and tracked face allow for much more reliable

Negative 10491 pI have a need to write a codeGTKcode application in codeCcode that does some animation using codeCairocode that will render into a codeGTKcode widget that exists in another running application. The idea is to do the very same thing you can do with codeVLCcode and codeMplayercode. For example codeMplayercode has the codewidcode option  brp  blockquote   pwid  also see guiwid X11, OpenGL and DirectX only       This tells MPlayer to attach to an existing window. Useful to embed MPlayer in a browser e.g. the plugger extension. This option   fills the given window completely, thus aspect scaling, panscan, etc   are no longer handled by MPlayer but must be managed by the   application that created the window.p blockquote  pWith this codeMplayercode option you can create a GTK application with a GTKImage widget, get its Xid and then play a movie in the codeGTKcode application using codeMplayercode with the Xid specified.p  pIm trying to do the same thing except renderdraw into the external window using codeCairocode. Anybody have suggestions or better yet a small code samplep

Negative 10491 pI am semi new to C and I have decided to try out coding a 15 puzzle.  This is an exercise I have done in the past in Delphi Paschal using 16 buttons, 16 button click events, and a whole lot of if statements.  This time, I programmatically created the buttons and I am using a single buttonClick method that all buttons use, and it is set up to check adjacent buttons and change the text of the button if the blank one is there.  This I have no problem with.  However, when trying to create a scrambler button, the way we did it in Delphi was to create a for look that looped 10,000 times.  Inside the loop we randomly picked a number 015 and called the Click method for that button.  Obviously not all clicks would register but doing this 10,00 times would sufficiently scramble the puzzle.  This takes about 1 second to complete in Delphi.  In C I am having a hard time getting the code to perform fast.  The Button.PerformClick action seems to run exceedingly slower than I expect it to.  Is there something I am doing wrong  I appreciate any help.  Thanksp  pHere is the code for the scramble button.p  precodevoid scrambleClickobject sender, MouseEventArgs e      for int i  0 i lt 1000 i              int temp  rand.Next16         int div  temp  4         int rem  temp  4         buttonClickpuzzle[div, rem], new EventArgs         Refresh       codepre  pthe buttons are in a 4x4 grid, and are accessed via the random number mod 4, as the x cooridate and random number intDiv 4 for the y coordinate.  If you would like any other information please let me know  Thanks againp

Negative 10491 pHeres the setup. I have two different GSON instances each with a custom ExclusionStrategy. That allows me to represent an object differently depending on the GSON instance used. Think Full Representation vs. Short Representation. If the object was a person, the short version might just spew first and last name while the full version would give lots of detail.p  pI also have custom serializersdeserializers registered. The problem is that the ExclusionStrategies arent invoked for classes that use a custom serializer. Id apply the Exclusion Strategy by hand, but I dont see any way of knowing, in my custom serializer, what Exclusion strategy should be in effect.p  pAny ideasp

I want to place it in shared memory so that other process could use it please note, it has to be shared between processes, not threads. How to make my custom allocator that suit my needs, so I could put it as Alloc parameter And what about other parameters   Traits and Items  normally you dont have to worry about it when you use only top level classes. Below I post the most interesting fragment, that Ive found uin the CGALs manual, which I think could be helpfulp  blockquote   pA HalfedgeDS is a class template and will be used   as argument for other class templates, for example CGALPolyhedron3.   The template parameters to instantiate the   HalfedgeDS will be provided by this other class   template. Therefore, the three template parameters and their meaning   are mandatory. We distinguish between the template   HalfedgeDS and an instantiation of it.p blockquote  pNote that I am interested only in solutions related to 3D geometry.p

Negative 10491 pI am currently working on a application where there is a requirement to generate binary combination of input signals in a truth table. p  pThe signal can be either 0 , 1 or X dont care.

What makes it difficult is the dont care X condition.p  pExamples  if we consider 3 bit signal X X X covers all combinations and it is the minimalp  hr  h2  X  X  Xh2  pbut if user changes X X X to X X 0 then the application has to insert new entry X X 1, so that all possible combinations are covered.p  hr  h2  X  X  0h2  h2  X  X  1h2  pagain if the user changes X X 0 to X 1 0, then I have to generate new entry X 0 0p  hr  h2  X  1  0h2  h2  X  X  1h2  h2  X  0  0h2  pNow if the user changes entry X 0 0 to X X X then all other entries have to be removed.

Negative 10491 pSay I have Project1 in a git repo. Within Project1 there is a subfolder that I want to include in Project1 Project2, Project3, etc. By include I dont mean copyandpaste.

Further, I want to place it in emmore than oneem location within Project1.p  pExamplep  precodeProject1 Subfolder1   Stuff I want... README.md  Project2 Subfolder1 lt from Project1 SomeOtherFolder   Subfolder1 lt from Project1 README.md codepre  pGit submodules wont work becausep  ul liThe submoldule is the entire repo, not the subfolder. I dont want the entire repo, just the one folder.li ul  pa hrefhttpwww.kernel.orgpubsoftwarescmgitdocshowtousingmergesubtree.html relnofollowThe subtree merge strategya wont work becausep  ul liOnly one subtree is supported when you do the pull for the subtree git pull s subtree... it only updates the one at the highest level no matter the order in which they were created.li ul  pNow bear in mind I am new to git so its possible the above conclusions are wrong. But this is what I have discovered through both research and experimentation.p  pThe possible solution I have come up with isp  ol liCreate a branch for Project1.li liDelete everything I dont want from this branch.li liMove the files I DO want to the root of this branch.li liDelete Subfolder.li liAdd this branch as a submodule to Project1.li ol  pThis sortakinda worked. I modified the Project1 master branch and was able to merge the changes into the new branch, and therefore update the submodule, but this seems unnecessarily complex given how easy it is in SVN. Furthermore when I merged the changes in Project1 it seemed to consider the deleted files as conflicted i.e. it was just a huge PITA to update Project1. Maybe I need a different merge strategyp  pBut mainly Im asking is this even the right path at allp  pFor the record, this is trivially easy with SVN Externals. So the usecase is there. And I realize its entirely possible no one is doing this with git. The explanations I can find online after a couple days of research all boil down to restructure your projects so each repo has what you want to share i.e. Subfolder from Project1 becomes its own repo. Im hoping thats not really the final answer.p  pThanksp

Negative 10491 pSo I have run into an issue and I think it is mostly because I havent worked with as2 in about 5 years so things are pretty hazy. Anyway, my problem is that I need to display PDF files within the flash movie. To do so I have resorted to running SWFTools in my backend and converting pdfs to swf for display. SWFTools, though, outputs AS2 files which I can load into AS3 but I cant actually control for example, calling stop. p  pThus I have resorted to using an AS2 loader which gets loaded into the AS3 project which is responsible for loading the converted pdf swfs. The problem I am running into is that the listener does not seem to be firing when I load the AS2 file in via AS3 but it fires just fine when run on its own.p  pThis is the code I am running. To summarize when I run this code on its own LOADED correctly prints to the output and the loaded SWF stops. However, when I run it via an AS3 container the swf loads in correctly but the LOADED trace never occurs and the stop is not executed.p  pthanks so much for any helpp  precodevar loaderMovieClipLoader  var listener   new Object listener.onLoadComplete  functionloadedClip      traceLOADED     loadedClip.stop   loadFiledatatesting.swf  function loadFiletarget     loader  new MovieClipLoader     loader.addListenerlistener     loader.loadCliptarget, holdermc  codepre

Negative 10491 pI have a problem with a servlet im working on. Its a site for mobile devices on spring framework, using Java and JQuery Mobile, deployed under weblogic. I use the same jsp for an app inside the site which may be different in case of different user roles  logged in  logged out users etc. If i log in and click on the button to the app, it looks correctly. I submit a wrong form, lets say, and a div with an error message appears on top. I click on home, then if i log out or not, then click again on the button, the page comes cached and the error is still displayed. The controller wont be accessed again, only if i input myself the request in the address bar.p  pAny idea what would be the problem  I tried response.setHeader with nocache and other solutions to disable browser caching, because this seems to be the problem, but none seems to work.p  pMy app flows something like this When the button from the homepage is clicked, the request calls the controller which verifies if you are logged in or not, then returns the jsp likep  precodeRequestMappingvalue recharge,method  RequestMethod.GET public String renderorg.springframework.ui.Model model, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws UnsupportedEncodingException        do some checks       return recharge      codepre  pThen when the jsp is loaded, it has the parameters needed to know what to show  hide. If you submit on the jsp, it goes to another function and does some ops. , then return the same jsp with some url parameters.p  pAll links to the app are like p  precodelta href  ltcurl valuemobilesiterechargegt  codepre  pThis seems to happen only if i submit the form in the JSP the url changes. I need those parameters though, so i cant lose them. But i want if the user leaves the page and clicks again to go to the app, all the rendering part to be computed again. Any ideas how could i get past this p  pThanks in advance p  pEDIT Firebug wont show the request when the link is clicked too.p

Negative 10491 pI dont know how to exactly title this question, so here is the explainationp  pI have a custom widget that emits a signal with a custom object built from the users input when finished with editing, e.g.p  precodevoid GGActionEditorfinishEditing    GGAction act    Set up according to user input   emit actionChangedact  codepre  pIn this code, receivers that are connected to the singal can store a copy of that object or process it in any way the see fit, and the widget can forget about it.p  pBut how to handle such a situation when the widget can build emdifferent typesem of objects from a class hierachry Likep  precodevoid GGActionEditorfinishEditing    GGAction pAct    Create and set up according to user input, e.g.   if ... pAct  new GGSpecialAction   else pAct  new SimpleAction   emit actionChangedpAct  codepre  pWhat is the best solution to handle the objects life cicle such a situation The widget cannot know if any receiver takes over the Action object. Also, if multiple receivers are connected, none of them knows if another object has taken over the parameter...br In the best case, this can cause a leak but it can also cause that the parameter will be deleted multiple times.p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr Some more information about my actual situation, however, Im also interested in general solutionsp  pThe passed object will be stored by a receiver and kept in the applications domain model. The model will take care of deleting it later.br The simple solution is to just handle this case like the simple byvalue case described above. However, if there are no receivers connected at all, the object would leak and there is no 100 guarantee that only 1 receiver will do this in my actual application logic this will be the case, but it can neither be checked nor enforced in this way.p  pI came up with some possible solutions, and are interested in any comments, or additionsp  ol liemJust hope it will work outembr Assume that there will be exactly 1 receiver that takes over the parameter. This might work well for my application, but I dont feel happy with itli liemUse a shared pointerembr As Eugene said in an answer, sharedptr or QSharedPointer would simplify this. Any reciever and the sender would use a shared pointer, so the life cycle is managed automatically. But this forces my domain model to also use a shared pointer for every class that holds such a Action object. This does not fit well in my model, since those classes should aggregate the action. A shared pointer doesnt feel right for holding a reference to an object that belongs to the object...li liemAdd parameter indicating overtakeembr Add a codeboolcode to the signal, that indicates if some receiver has taken over the action. A receiver knowns that it cannot overtake it anymore, if the value will be true. Also the sender knows if it should delete the object if no receiver has taken it. But it is quite random which receiver will take the object, in a firstcome firstserve manner. And it polutes the interface...li liemUse different signals for different concrete classesembr In this case, the receivers slots can emknowem which concrete subclass is used and make a copy of the object. But this adds additional signalsslots for something that can be very well done using the class hierarchy... Also a copyctor must be available for every subclass.li liemAdd a codeclonecode method to the classesembr Similar to above, but only 1 signal. The polymorphic codeclonecode would create a copy of the concrete subclass.li liemUse a specialized interface instead of signalslotembr Make a codeGGIActionReceivercode class, and assign at most 1 instance in the codeGGActionEditorcode. This instance is the only eligable object to take over the Action object. Others can still be signalled, but they mustnt overtake the pointer. This way, the sender also knows if the object must be deleted no receiver setli ol

Negative 10491 pthis is more of a speculative question as to what you all consider to be the best approach or smartest method to a particular problem I have.p  pI am developing a web app currently which is largely driven by a huge XML tree. The point of the app is to randomly generate an appropriate sequence of nodes based on their relationship to one another.p  pThe nodes are really well categorized but the initial selection needs to be largely stochastic and the next selections based on the first node. The choices should be random but there should not be a noticeable and logical similarity between each selection.p  pFor example given the following treep  precodeltthingsgt     ltfoodsgt         ltfruitsgt             ltfruitgtappleltfruitgt             ltfruitgtorangeltfruitgt             ltfruitgtmelonltfruitgt             ltfruitgtbananaltfruitgt             ltfruitgtgrapeltfruitgt         ltfruitsgt         ltvegetablesgt             ltvegetablegtpotatoltvegetablegt             ltvegetablegtcarrotltvegetablegt             ltvegetablegtonionltvegetablegt             ltvegetablegtleekltvegetablegt         ltvegetablesgt     ltfoodsgt     ltanimalsgt         ltbirdsgt             ltbirdgtpenguinltbirdgt             ltbirdgtostrichltbirdgt             ltbirdgtparrotltbirdgt             ltbirdgtcrowltbirdgt             ltbirdgtemultbirdgt         ltbirdsgt         ltfishgt             ltfishgtcodltfishgt             ltfishgtplaiceltfishgt             ltfishgtsalmonltfishgt             ltfishgtsharkltfishgt             ltfishgttunaltfishgt         ltfishgt     ltanimalsgt ltthingsgt codepre  p... if the first item selected is shark, then tuna is a close relative, though an item from the birds category is also accessible as it holds a certain similarity  it is a living thing. However, a vegetable is entirely unrelated and should not be selected.p  pConsidering the fact that my xml tree is absolutely huge I need an intelligent way of performing similarity checks.p  pAny thoughts, opinions, or guidance is greatly appreciated.

Negative 10491 pI have a multimodule Maven project.  For the sake of this example, consider two modulesp  ul licodedatacodeli licodeconsumercodeli ul  pModule codeconsumercode has module codedatacode as a dependency.p  pModule codedatacode declares a bunch of core classes.  There are tests under codesrctestcode that use them.  These tests require some longwinded object creation, so I have a class with some utility methods in it to create these objects.  This utility class codeSampleDataHelpercode is in the codesrctestcode hierarchy.p  pI also have some tests in the codeconsumercode module that need to create some of these longwinded objects.  I want to use my codeSampleDataHelpercode class defined in codedata srctestcode in tests that reside in my codeconsumer srctestcode tree.  Unfortunately, even though codedatacode is a dependency of codeconsumercode, codeconsumercode cant see the classes that exist under codedata srctestcode.p  pTo combat this, I thought I might create emanotherem module codedatatestcode, and move codeSampleDataHelpercode to it under strongcodesrcmaincodestrong.  Then I would include codedatatestcode as a emtest scopeem dependency of codedatacode.  Unfortunately, this introduces a circular dependency codedatacode uses codedatatestcode, but codedatatestcode also requires codedatacode. p  pThe only solution Ive come up with is to place codeSampleDataHelpercode under codedata srcmaincode under a codetestcode package and hope that no real application code ever calls it.p  pHow can I share my codeSampleDataHelpercode class between modules emwithoutem putting it under codesrcmaincodep

Negative 10491 pSo I was watching c videos on youtube yesterday and came across one the was about C11 rvalue reference and move semantics.

Negative 10491 pI just became aware that AWT  Swing under Java JDK 1.7 as of JDK 7u15 does not support Retina displays on Apple Macbook Pros.

It also doesnt work under the latest dev builds of Java 8. Swing and JavaFX apps are blurry on a Retinia MacBook. This is why IntelliJ still runs under Java 6.p blockquote  pMy question is more specific than what is asked by the OP of the above thread.p  pMy employer of less than a month uses Swing in all of its applications.  For several reasons we are interested in migrating to Java 7 from Java 6.  Within the last several days, another developer who is on Windows, moved our platform over to Java 7.  As Im running a retina Macbook Pro, I noticed the issue when I pulled the latest stable branch of our code.p  pI am new to Java with less than a year of experience in the community, hence my question Will the Java community be fairly responsive to this issue moving forward, or should a substantial delay be anticipated months to a year or more before Swing in Java 7 is compatible with Apple Retina displaysp

It is working but in some cases, the render takes more than a few seconds.  And there is no indication that the subreport has been called and is loading.  So they end up clicking multiple times, etc.    p  pWhen users click the action link and nothing seems to be happening.  Although the report is called and generating.  There is no Loading gif displayed as they are used to seeing when they click View Report.  p  pUsers access a ReportBuilder type page, where they can call canned reports and select parameters and view reports.  p  pIs there a way to get the action link to display the Loading message when clicked  As is the case from clicking View Report.  p
Negative 10491 pI have a web site where the users upload photos and create photobooks. Also, they can add text at absolute positions, rotations, and alignments.

Negative 10491 pIm using Python 2.7.3. I have parallelised some code using subclassed codemultiprocessing.Processcode objects. If there are no errors in the code in my subclassed Process objects, everything runs fine. But if there are errors in the code in my subclassed Process objects, they will apparently crash silently no stacktrace printed to the parent shell and CPU usage will drop to zero. The parent code never crashes, giving the impression that execution is just hanging. Meanwhile its really difficult to track down where the error in the code is because no indication is given as to where the error is.p  pI cant find any other questions on stackoverflow that deal with the same problem.p  pI guess the subclassed Process objects appear to crash silently because they cant print an error message to the parents shell, but I would like to know what I can do about it so that I can at least debug more efficiently and so that other users of my code can tell me when they run into problems too.p  pstrongEDITstrong my actual code is too complex, but a trivial example of a subclassed Process object with an error in it would be something like thisp  precodefrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue  class WorkerProcess      def initself, inputQueue, outputQueue          superWorker, self.init          self.inputQueue  inputQueue         self.outputQueue  outputQueue      def runself          for i in iterself.inputQueue.get, STOP               code that does stuff              1  0  Dumb error               more code that does stuff              self.outputQueue.putresult codepre

Negative 10491 pI am currently in the process of writing a static iOS framework that connects developers to my API and returns to them objectified information at their users requests. However, in order for this framework to be worthwhile, one of the requirements is that this framework must be able to cache the information locally and return an offline copy when a network connection is unavailable. I am aware that I can store this information in NSUserDefaults but there may be a  case where the information that is cached may be private and the local developer should not be able to have access by guessing the proper key. I believe that best approach will involve some sort of encryption but I wanted to see if there were any other storage options available to a static framework other than NSUserDefaults.p  pI would like to keep my data in an objectified format if possible. Two solutions I would be interested in exploring would be to save my offline data in either SQLite or CoreData. However, with both of these approaches I am concerned about how these files would be stored in the framework I already have an embedded framework and the security issues of having the schema for these files available in the bundle for the developer to see. p  pAnother solution that I am looking into would be to see if iOS supports any tools such as gzip that could be used to password protect my files until they are used by the framework. p  pHas anyone successfully overcome any of these issues Is there anything else I should be looking into besides the previously mentioned possible solutions Any advice will be warmly welcomed. p  pThanks.  p  pP.S. Does anyone know of any resources I could go read relating to iOS Security or static frameworks Either would be very helpful. p

Negative 10491 pMy PC is Windows 7 64bit Im on the U.S. East coast Eastern Time the Date and Time applet  reached by rightclicking on the taskbar clock and choosing Adjust datetime  labels my time zone UTC0500 Eastern Time U.S. amp Canada and tells me that Daylight Savings Time ends in November.  For those coming along later, this was written in April, after we did the spring forward to get to Daylight Savings Time.p  pCalling either the Windows GetTimeZoneInformation or GetDynamicTimeZoneInformation APIs the latter only available on Vista or later returns a bias value of 300 minutes, 5 hours.  The bias value is not negative because the doc for that value says UTC  local time  bias.p  pBut if I go to the a hrefhttpwwp.greenwichmeantime.cominfoiso.htm relnofollowISO web site that claims to show me the time on my computera it displays a time that matches a clock but ends 0400.  I tried to copypaste it but its difficult as it changes every second.  Typing current time utc into Google shows a time that is also 4 not 5 hours ahead of the clock time here.p  pConfusing me a bit more  I have an EC2 instance running Windows Server 2008 that someone else set up and said was intentionally set to GMT so that times recorded based on the server clock wouldnt have 1hour jumps caused by Daylight Savings Time.p  pWhen I connect to that server, it shows a time 5 hours ahead of what I see here.  But its DateTime applet in Control Panel different from Windows 7 shows that the current time zone is GMT Greenwich Mean Time Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London but there is also a time zone GMT Coordinated Universal Time  UTC  and if I change the time zone to that something I think is correct, the offset is 4 hours.  p  pThe Time Zone Settings dialog on Windows 7 reached by clicking the Change time zone... button on the Date and Time applet discussed above has time zones labelled UTC Coordinated Universal Time 4 hours from now and UTC Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London 5 hours from now.p  pOther than thinking that the EC2 instance had its time zone set wrong  it should have been set to UTC not London time to accomplish the goal stated above  I am not any further along in understanding this.  Windows 7 in the U.S. says Im 5 hours from UTC everything else including Windows 2008 set to UTC time says 4 hours.p  pSo what should a routine do to produce an ISOstyle timestamp with a trailing timezone offset  The Windows API tells me it should be 0500, but everything else says it should be 0400.

Negative 10491 pI apologize in advance if this is not the appropriate forum for this question. I looked at a hrefhttpandroid.stackexchange.comhttpandroid.stackexchange.coma and it appeared that it definitely wasnt appropriate for that forum.p  pMy company has developed two apps. One for our business users and one for our consumer users. Marketing is very concerned about business users being confused by the offerings and has determined they would like to separate these apps.p  pWe created two google accounts, paid the developer cost twice and used a different legal name for our company in one account from the other. Yet when we search for the business app it brings the consumer app back in the results.p  pWeve been over all the information and there are no references between the two in either store listing. Anyone know why they might still be associated and what we can do to prevent itp  pOddly enough I was able to talk to a google support person but they were not developer support and were unable to help me or direct me to anyone who couldp

Negative 10491 pI am creating a script in bash to call a command 100 times, varying a float parameter each time. I need to call it with 0.01, then 0.02, 0.03 up to 0.5. As I cannot create a loop using a float in the condition or in the step I am not sure of how to do it. I tried doing the loop from 1 to 50 and then inside dividing the number by 100, transforming that into a float, and calling the command with that, but then the command basically I am calling Weka and the number corresponds to the confidence interval doesnt recognize the parameter correctly so maybe I am using the wrong datatype.p  pThanks in advance Patriciop
Negative 10491 pI have created a simple function that returns a value depending on which Keys have matching values with the exception that if the key is empty or null then this does not count. My code is below.p  precodefunction getFontData      font  []     font[Font]  Arial     font[Font2]  Arial     font[Font3]  Arial      return font     function compareFonts      compare  0       font  getFontData       if emptyfont[Font] ampamp font[Font]  font[Font2]          compare  1      elseif emptyfont[Font] ampamp font[Font]  font[Font3]          compare  2      elseif emptyfont[Font2] ampamp font[Font2]  font[Font3]          compare  3      elseif emptyfont[Font] ampamp font[Font]  font[Font2] ampamp font[Font2]  font[Font3]          compare  4           return compare    matches  compareFonts  vardumpmatches codepre  pThe issue that i am having is that the code which I have written for the function to recognize three identical array keys does not seem to get executed in my if statements. The output in this example is 1. which indicates to me that my code is returning the first if statement which in essence would be true since both font and font2 match so there would be no need for the code to go further.p  pI am assuming that there is a better way of doing this or I am completely wrong in my approach.

Negative 10491 pIve seen multiple articles discussing how to configure your RDP settings via visual studio, credential caching via the RDP program, and yet we still have a problem.p  pIve also seen articles saying you need to add an endpoint to your role for RDP  If I do that, Visual Studio complains that an endpoint is already defined for remote desktop  because it does this behind the scenes or so it seems when you enable RDP via the UI. It wont let me publish, so Im going to cringe assume this is already done for me.p  pI should also note, we have other Azure Services and we are able to RDP to them just fine. Our local connectionfirewall as much as I wish I could blame it is not to blame.p  pHeres what is going on If I delete all instances of my cloud service and deploy via visual studio yes, Ive enabled remote desktop, set a password, set my cert to auto as well as tried various certs in the drop down, I connect via RDP by using the Connect button directly from the Windows Azure portal. I am prompted for a username which is prepopulated and a password. p  pI am unable to log in because my credentials are invalid. Ive tried redeploying and typing a new password... same result. Ive tried changing the password via Azure Portal... same result.p  pPart 2 If I have an instance previously deployed and I change the password via visual studio and deploy again, I am unable to RDP to the machine at all. I do not get the loginpw prompt, and get the unable to connect to remote machine..., remote desktop is not enabled, the machine is turned off, etc. error message. p  pSo essentially, I have two problems. Why am I unable to RDP after a second deploy on top of a previous, and why are my credentials always invalid regardless This is driving me nuts, Ive even gone as far as doing compares between my other projects config files to see if something was missing  no dice. It all looks the same minus names and dates. p  pCan anyone relate First question ever posted, Ive been lurking for years. Hi.p

Negative 10491 pIve got a c, .net 4, mdi Windows Forms application which configurates a product. The product is one of a kind, it always looks different but similar. p  pI would like to create a simple technical 2D drawing which is created and shown based on the user input. My idea is, that the user enters the product data in one mdi form and the drawing is shown in another mdi form. The drawing should be created in its own thread, so the user does not have to wait for it.p  pAbout the drawing It should contain lines and rectangles with different colors, filled and unfilled. Some linesrectangles have text information next to it, f.e. to show the dimensions or a name.p  pI am not sure which way i should go to create the drawing. My first ideas were to use Microsoft Visio Drawing Control or just to draw on a Form. But i am not sure if thats really the way to go. p  pI am grateful for any suggestions.

Negative 10491 pSorry in advance for the long post, and thanks to whoever will take the time to get to the end and give me feedback.p  pI have performance related questions regarding operations on lists and arrays.p  pI have written a software to perform some operations on data gathered from an array of sensors. In an attempt to make it run faster, I am currently attempting to write some optimizations.p  pThe data gathered is in a NbyM array of doubles actually implemented as a class extending codeListltListltdoublegtgtcode. We always have codethis.Count  Ncode and codethis[i].Count  Mcode for any value of i. Basically, its a rectangular array.p  pEach data point from this array is correlated to some points on a XbyY map. Basically, imagine this to be an image I make out of the data to represent it in a quick and clear manner. Hence there is, for each data point a codeListltint[]gtcode of the mappoints it relates to. This fact is represented by codeListltint[]gt[,] pointsLocalcode. I also hold a static codeListltint[]gt[,]code where I store this same information this way I can modify codepointsLocalcode to my leisure in an elaboration loop, and have a fresh copy the next time these methods are called. The same sensor will always be correlated to the same points, and that is why I have that local array. Some points most of them actually are related to more than one sensor, and thus are in many lists.p  pIn other parts of my code I am able to correctly identify the fact that some sensors of the array had some issue, and the data then contains errors. This is represented in codeprivate ListltListltboolgtgt faultyDatacode. If a sensor gives a faulty output, then I have to assume that all the points is it correlated to may suffer from the fault, thus I dont care for the results of further analysis in those mappoints.p  pThe computational part of my code aggregates data from all the sensors in the array for each mappoint. What I am trying to do is to predetermine a subset of mappoints on which I dont have to perform any analysis.p  pThe class codePointsEqualityComparercode is a custom comparison operator for codeint[]code, that I use because mappoints are identified by their 2D coordinates.p  precodepublic class Sinogram  ListltListltdoublegtgt      various enums    private ListltListltboolgtgt faultyData faultyData[i][j] is true if there is an error in the data     constructors     some methods     public void dataAnalysis              Listltint[]gt[,] pointsLocal  new Listltint[]gt[this.Count, this[0].Count]         Listltint[]gt faultyPoints  new Listltint[]gt         Fill pointsLocal with the correlated points from the static array         PointsEqualityComparer myComparer  new PointsEqualityComparer         Point selection parts see later for the two different implementations         Actual analysis parts not here because it is not relevant to my question, but it works       codepre  pThe comparer class is as follow. I already found out that the codeGetHashCodecode method had to return results as unique as possible to improve performance, so I implemented it as you see in this snippet.p  precode public class PointsEqualityComparer  IEqualityComparerltint[]gt       public bool Equalsint[] p1, int[] p2              bool result  p1.Count  p2.Count ampamp p1.Count  2 ampamp p1[0]  p2[0] ampamp p1[1]  p2[1]         return result           public int GetHashCodeint[] obj              return obj[0]  obj[1]  obj[0]  obj[1]  1  obj[1]       codepre  pNow for the tricky parts. I have two different implementations for the portion of code where I actually select which mappoints are interesting. By interesting I mean the mappoints on which I will have to aggregate the data from the sensors. I select them by actually identifying the points subject to errors and removing them from the lists.p  pIn my first implementation I loop through all Lists of mappoints. If the corresponding sensor was faulty, I add those points to a list of faulty points avoiding duplicates. Once I looped through all points and generated the full list of faulty ones, I update codeallPairsLocalcode by removing them. The list of faultyPoints can become rather big, especially in some cases when a lot of sensors report errors the maximum theoretical size is more than 2000000 elements, if all the sensors report error and I am trying to create a 19201080 map to plot as an HD imagep  precodefor int i  0 i ltthis.Count i      for int j  0 j lt this[i].Count j              if faultyData[i][j]                      faultyPoints  faultyPoints.Unionltint[]gtallPairsLocal[i, j], myComparer.ToList                for int i  0 i ltthis.Count i      for int j  0 j lt this[i].Count j              allPairsLocal[i, j]  allPairsLocal[i, j].ExceptfaultyPoints, myComparer.ToList       codepre  pIn my second implementation I tried to have a smaller faultyPoints list. Thus, what I do is, for each sensor reporting errors, use its list to remove mappoints from all the others and its own as well. This maintains the dimensions of the lists smaller, but at the cost of more annidated loops.p  precodefor int i  0 i ltthis.Count i      for int j  0 j lt this[i].Count j              if faultyData[i][j]                      faultyPoints  allPairsLocal[i, j]. ToList             for int x  0 x lt this.Count x                              for int y  0 y lt this[x].Count y                                      allPairsLocal[x, y]  allPairsLocal[x, y].ExceptfaultyPoints, myComparer.ToList                                              codepre  pBoth of these implementations are very slow, and I guess this is at least partly because of the size of the data sets. Both take way longer that performing the data analysis steps on the whole datasets. Are there ways to make similar operations but with faster implementations Some steps can probably be made parallel, but that wouldnt really change the substance. Are there data structures that have O1 methods to implement what I do here with Union and Exceptp  pAgain thank you for having read through my whole post. I appreciate any feedback, even if it is not a full answer, and I am more than available to clarify what points I can.p

Negative 10491 pI build the app I am working on for iOS 7 and ran it on an iPad 2. I noticed it was markedly slower than when build for iOS 6. I did some investigating and found that the main point of slowness was in setting the UINavigationBars UIBarButtonItems. This seemed weird as I hadnt noticed this in other applications but since I use UIAppearance to customise the buttons in this app i thought that might have something to do with it. So I commented the UIAppearance code out and the app was back to normal. I still wish to use the custom appearance though so Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this or has some insight into it.p  pI should add that the app works fine in the simulator.p  pThanksp

This is probably because the where the mvn install on the Parent POM is not replacing the module.version with the actual version for the child modules. p  pParentPOMp  precodeltproject ..gt      ltgroupIdgtthe.company.projectltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtParentPOMltartifactIdgt   ltversiongt1.0SNAPSHOTltversiongt   ...    ltpropertiesgt      ltmodule.versiongt1.0ltmodule.versiongt   ltpropertiesgt  ltprojectgt codepre  pSP1Child1p  precodeltproject ..gt      ltparentgt   ...   ltparentgt    ltgroupIdgtthe.company.projectltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtSP1Child1ltartifactIdgt   ltversiongtmodule.versionltversiongt   ...  ltprojectgt codepre  pHow how can my mvn install update the versions in the .POM files in the maven repository Or how can I run one of my submodules without any version errorsp

Negative 10491 pI have the distance between 4 points. I want to plot this data on a 2D grid. p  pI have tried taking one point and placing it on 0,0 to start. Then I can create circles that represent possible locations for the the three other points. Once I get to that point I can lock in an arbitrary position for point two. Do the same possible locations and get to two possible location for point 3. I can just pick one and then figure out four. I know its possible, I can get to the answer on paper but I wonder if there is an easier way than how I am going about it that others have already figured out. p  pIf someone could point me in the right direction or point me towards some reading that discusses the formulas involved in determining these points that would be great.p  pThanksp  pWhat Ive triedp  precodepoints  [A, B, C, D] unknown  angles  [AoA, AoB, AoC, AoD]  distances  [AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD] known  A.x  0 seeded value A.y  0 seeded value B.x  AB B.y  A.y C.x  AB  BC  AC  2  AB assume positive answer C.y  Math.sqrtBC  B.x  C.x  B.y D.x   D.y   codepre

Negative 10491 pI have written a complex program using opencv 1.0, and this program can continuously keep running over 72 hours. But recently I changed opencv to version 2.4.6. A minority of the program is rewritten using opencv 2.4.6 data structures, while the other codes remain as before for opencv 2.4 could be compatible with opencv 1.0 codes. However, the new program could run no longer then 12 hours, always crashing after 1011 hours at Matcreate when I allocate memory for a image which is about 120MB. I used trycatch to get the cvException error message. It points to alloc.cpp and the message is failed to allocate xxx bytes. I looked up the Tast Manager and found that the memory used by this program is less then 200MB as it crashes. The total memory is 4GB and the total memory used by all of programs and the system is about 1GB, which means that the memory is definitely large enough.  I checked for memory leaks and found nothig helpful. I doubt if there is too many memory segments making the largest memory block is smaller than 120MB. But I cannot verify this. Could anybody tell me how can I detect the problem Or How can I look up the detailed memory status as the program cashes Thank you very much.p

Negative 10491 pI have a collection of posts with updatedat timestamps. I want to fetch the documents in batches, sorted by updatedat timestamp latest first without using skip as it slows down with larger values. I could pass the timestamp of the last document of the set to the next query, and use  codelt gt lasttimestampcode to fetch the next batch, but there is no guarantee of updatedat being unique there can be multiple insertionswrites at the same time. Another approach could be that I use lte and discard repeated entries on client side again, this could be buggy if the batch size consists of only repeated entries, i.e. all the entries in batch were posted at the same timestamp. Please note that the updatedat timestamp changes on some specific events, so I cannot rely on BSON id for ordering.p  pHow do I ensure that I get create a unique identifier as BSON id using the updatedat timestamp, and how to I change it whenever updatedat is changed, so that the order changes. I am using mongoid in a rails app.p  pAre there any other approaches to achieve this Currently I query like thisp  precodePost.descupdatedat.whereuser gt user.whereupdatedat.lt gt lastentrytimestamp.limit10 codepre

Negative 10491 pSo basically I have an app that will provide tasks based on selected project. Both projects and tasks are stored in a SQLite database. p  pTo get the current project id I compare the selected project selectedProject to my database, to get the ID. This is done in my getSelectedProjectId method. However, when running this method in the getTasks method, the Wherestatement wont work at all. If I dont run the getSelectedProjectId method first, it works just fine. Am I forgetting to release something Or is it something else Any ideas p  pIm pretty new to both SQLite and Objective C, so this may not be a complex issue. I have made sure the getSelectedProjectId method returns the correct project ID. I have also made sure the query that is run in the getTasks method is correct, and when running it through my terminal it returns a number of rows. In the app it returns nothing, provided Im running the getSelectedProjectId somewhere in that method first.p  pThis is the method that fetches the tasksp  precode voidgetTasks      [self openDB]     sqlite3stmt statement     int projectId  [self getSelectedProjectId]     NSString query  [NSString stringWithFormatSELECT  FROM tasks WHERE projectidi, projectId]     const char querystatement  [query UTF8String]      sqlite3preparev2contactDB, querystatement, 1, ampstatement, NULL      while sqlite3stepstatement  SQLITEROW               I add the task title to my array of tasks here.          sqlite3finalizestatement     sqlite3closecontactDB  codepre  pAnd this is the method that gets the correct project id from the databasep  precode intgetSelectedProjectId      sqlite3stmt    statement     NSString        query               [[NSString alloc]                                        initWithFormatSELECT id FROM projects WHERE title LIMIT 0,1,                                        selectedProject]     int             rowId                0     const char      querystatement     [query UTF8String]      [self openDB]     sqlite3preparev2contactDB, querystatement, 1, ampstatement, NULL      if sqlite3stepstatement  SQLITEROW              rowId  sqlite3columnintstatement, 0           sqlite3finalizestatement     sqlite3closecontactDB      return rowId  codepre

Negative 10491 pAll, p  pI am testing some java code that validates an XML digital signature. I am using the standard JSR 105 API in the JDK. I am using an Exclusive Canonicalization method and an Enveloped signature. The incoming XML message looks something like thisp  precodeltdoc xmlnsaurnabc.my.domain.comgt     ltaxgt12345ltaxgt ltdocgt codepre  pThis message goes through a complex system with various XML parsers CXF, JAXB, XSLT, etc. and somehow gets changed to thisp  precodeltdoc xmlnsburnabc.my.domain.comgt     ltbxgt12345ltbxgt ltdocgt codepre  pAfter the change, the XML signature that is attached will no longer validate. The Reference is not valid. p  pIn my opinion, even though this XML document changed, it appears to be equivalent XML. The only thing that changed was the namespace prefix. I am not sure if namespace prefix changes meet the rules for XML Canonicalization. My questions arep  ol liShould this work li liHow can I get this to work Transformation, etc.li ol  pAny help is appreciated,p  pg8torPaulp

Negative 10491 pI need to get a name of objects instance at runtime. I have a way of doing it but I think there must be a better way.p  pLets say I have 4 forms FormA1, FormA2, FormA2 and DormA4. They all derive from FormA. FormA never gets instantiated  lets say it is virtual.p  pI also have FormB. Each of the FormA children can at runtime, upon certain event, instantiate FormB. FormBs job is to take some information and return it to the form that called it instantiated it at runtime. But without knowing the name of calling forms instance I cant access any of calling forms properties.p  pThe way I currently do it is I have a constructor in FormB that takes a reference to sender as argument using FormA as type, examplep  precodepublic class FormB  Form     private FormA referenceForm     public FormBref FormA callingForm             referenceForm  callingForm      codepre  pthis way I can hale local methods access properties of calling form. Of course to get specific properties I need code reflection so I would get the right type and access to specific properties of children. Alternatively, I think, I could create FormHandler class, instantiate it every time child form gets instantiated and pass values inside events but this may make it more complicated than necessary.p  pstrongSo the question is, how do you get instance name of an object so you can access its propertiesstrongp

Negative 10491 pIm trying to write a Node program that populates my MySQL database with data from files I have on disk. I may or may not be going about this the right way, but its working. What Im having trouble with is understanding how I should be handling allowing asynchronous functions to finish before the connection to the DB is ended. Ultimately, Ill be reading lots of data files, and insert them into the database like I did below. I could just use codereadFileSynccode instead of the asynchronous version, but I need to get a better handle on asynchronous functions.p  pWhen I insert the wine categories below, it works fine since its not using an asynchronous function. However, when I use codereadFilecode to get data from a file, I get an error that connection ended before any of the queries were executedp  precodeconnection.connect functionerr      iferr          console.logerr         Take a table and the values, and insert a new row into a table function insertinto table, values       if values instanceof Array           values  values.map function value               return   value           .join,       else          values    values             var statement  INSERT INTO   table   VALUES NULL,   values       connection.query statement, functionerr, rows, fields        if err throw err        console.log values   successfully added.

Negative 10491 pIm working with Catel, MVVM, WPF and am wondering about how to work with nestedhiearchical data. p  pLets say from a database Ive got a list of Customers, each with a list of Invoices, each with a list of InvoiceItems.  Customers own many Invoices which own many InvoiceItems.p  pIve got a working solution, but I do not like it. My approach was to build a collection of classes that would act a kind of like an ado.net dataset. A class would represent each layer of the hiearchy. p  pThis top level class, CustomerModel, would contain a collection of of InvoiceBlocksp  pstrongCustomerModelstrongbr ObservableCollection of lt InvoicesBlocks       p  pEach InvoceBlock would contain an Invoice and a collection of InvoiceItemsp  pstrongInvoiceBlockstrongbr    Invoicebr ObservableCollection of lt InvoiceItems  p  pIt seemed clever until wading through the databinding path satements.

This way, I can then have threads that can access this instance. I think because of how much sharing I want to do, it needs to go on the heap and not the stack.p  pI wouldnt consider making this its own program and then using networking io to interact because of how simple it is. Needless to say, this is not exactly what Im doing however I think Ive made a simplifiedgeneric enough example that if this can be solved then I can easily apply it to my solution and it might help others.p  pAgain, Im looking for a way to share one instance of this code between two separate processes. p  pI dont know if this can be done because the class has a linked list in it let alone a file in it. If it can, then whose heap and file table does it fill both.p  pEDITp  pThanks for the help so far however, it should be worth pointing out that both processes may not be running at the same time. One acts as a daemon and the other will appears intermittently. Both programs already have threads, so thats why I want to do it on the heap. p

Negative 10491 pIs it possible to run CUDA or OpenCL applications from a Linux kernel module I have found a project which is providing this functionality, but it needs a userspace helper in order to run CUDA programs. a hrefhttpscode.google.compkgpu relnofollowhttpscode.google.compkgpuap  pWhile this project already avoids redundant memory copying between user and kernel space I am wondering if it is possible to avoid the userspace completelyp  pstrongEDITstrong Let me expand my question. I am aware that kernel components can only call the API provided by the kernel and other kernel components. So I am not looking to call OpenCL or CUDA API directly.  CUDA or OpenCL API in the end has to call into the graphics driver in order to make its magic happen. Most probably this interface is completely nonstandard, changing with every release and so on....p  pBut suppose that you have a compiled OpenCL or CUDA kernel that you would want to run. Do the OpenCLCUDA userspace libraries do some heavy lifting before actually running the kernel or are they just lightweight wrappers around the driver interfacep  pI am also aware that the userspace helper is probably the best bet for doing this since calling the driver directly would most likely get broken with a new driver release...p

For example,p  p1 subscribe    void mySystem.subscribecollection, QUERYname ltlt abc, callBackp  pwhere callback is defined as    void ClientCallbackChangedDocuments, Operation             handle the change    p  p2 if someone calls mySystem.Addcollection, documentsNameIsAbc, the callback will be called, so that the subscribing clients are notified of changes.p  pThis needs to be done as fast as possible, so something like scanning redo log will not work for me.p  pstrongPossibilitiesstrong a A naive way would be remember results of all QUERYs, after each addremoveupdate, run all QUERYs again, and then send diffs as notification. p  pb A bit smarter way would be take the changing documentbefore any db operation, check whether it matchs any QUERYs. If so, send notification. However, sounds like this kind of match is not supported.p  pc Take QUERY is in regex format, serialize the changing document to json format, and run regex match.p  pI am using C, although the problem sounds language neutral.p  pAny inputs are welcome.p

Negative 10491 pIm using the Doctrine2 masterslave configuration in Symfony2 to scale my application across a single master database and several readonly replicated slaves. p  pThis works perfectly from within my application and Doctrine2 sensibly uses the slave for readonly queries and the master for write operations.p  pIf in one of my controllers, I wrotep  precodeem  thisgtgetdoctrinegtgetManager vardumpemgtgetConnectiongtisConnectedToMaster codepre  pcodeisConnectedToMastercode returns codefalsecode  which I would expect since the slave is connected to by default. p  pThis is also the case if I run this code inside a codeWebTestCasecodep  pHowever if I wrote the exact same code inside a Symfony console command ContainerAwareCommandp  precodeem  thisgtgetContainergtgetdoctrinegtgetManager vardumpemgtgetConnectiongtisConnectedToMaster codepre  pcodeisConnectedToMastercode returns true.

Negative 10491 pThis is a theorical question, since I have a bare idea about the concept, and have not any code yet.p  pSuppose I use Websockets with Tornado and, in a bridged fashion, a django project which would handle regular connections. This means the actual server is Tornado, which receives every request and, if the request has NOT a path of socket say, the django wsgi handler would handle it via a fallback container. On the other side, requests to socket path must have ws or wss protocols and are treated as websockets by Tornado.  p  pWhen the connection starts, the first request before the Upgrade will have the cookies, and I can grab the session id from the cookies and use the session manager to get the session object by ID. For the lapse of that connection, which since its a websocket connection itll be a longterm one, I will have the same value for the session id cookie since I cannot get agin the cookie headers, because the websocket connection doesnt send headers anymore  the idea is to reduce the overhead, and passing cookies with the message can have a huge overhead.p  pIts ok until now Websockets connect, send the cookie only once, the serverside bound for that socket can have that cookie value the session id and play with it until the connection is closed.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong How can I detect, in real time, that a session is not available anymore possible reasons 1. user issued a resource which involves closing the current session, althought its done via AJAX and the websocket is not closed 2. session expired due to idleness 3. somehow by use of django api the session is closed, althought that doesnt imply the current execution context for that is the request being closed  I dont ever know if such scenario is possible.p  pstrongNotesstrong detecting when a specific session was closed could help me to determine whether the corresponding websockets must be closed as well.p

Negative 10491 pI have a primary blob storage in codeWest Europecode region that contains user uploaded files accessed through a we application within the same region.  This suffers from high latency, say if youre in codeEast UScode region.p  pSo I add another instance of the application to the East US region, and use traffic manager to route between the two instances based on performance. Users in the East US region now talk to the application instance in their own region.p  pThe problem is, now the East US instance is talking to the blob store in West Europe, so the application suffers from the latency.  I can turn on georedundancy for the West Europe blob store, but this is basically just for backup, not performance, as I cant pick which region to replicate to.p  pI cant use a CDN, since the files being access are the users private files, and I only generated Shared Access Signatures for each URL when the user interacts with the application.

Negative 10491 pIm trying to increase the height of a button via animation when another button is clicked. The issue Im having is that instead of increasing it, it decreases it back to the starting height. After doing some searching around on Stackoverflow, it appears that the issue has to do with having autolayout enabled. I tried disabling autolayout and this is exactly the issue. I would like to know though, if there is a work around that doesnt involve disabling autolayout.

Negative 10491 pI have a very basic problem with Node.jsExpressJade thats surprisingly hard to describe. In my node.js application I use the Express framework for routing of HTTP requests. I also use Jade templates as views, who themselves link to files css, js etc. inside a directory that I have declared as static through the codeapp.useexpress.staticdirname  publiccode command.p  pWhen I route requests to resources like codeaboutcode or codecontactcode everything works as expected. But I found that as soon as my resources have multiple levels like so codeaboutmecode the same jade view would still render, but it ends up in the browser without CSS stylingp  pSo my assumption is that the virtual directories represented by the resource levels screw up where jade thinks it must look for relative paths in this case, where to find the codepubliccode directory containing the static files.p  pI cant just prefix the paths inside the jade template since I have to use the same template for different resource types, so I need a solution that works for arbitrary resource levels.p  pIs there such a solutionp

Negative 10491 pI am using jQuery Mobile with Yii Framework.p  pYii framework allows easy partial render for Ajax requests.p  pjQuery Mobile on the other hand will not display anything that is not within the datarolepage container.

Negative 10491 pIm using Xcode6beta2, but Ive had the same issue since the very first public beta. My Swift subclass of ObjC UIViewController looks like thisp  precodeclass SomeVC UIViewController      var c1  gt            printlnself           var c2  gt           get              return  printlnself                     var c3  gt           return  printlnself            override func viewDidAppearanimated Bool          super.viewDidAppearanimated         c1         c2         c3       codepre  pWhen the VC is shown, I see the following lines printed outp  precodeFunction ltTtC12SwiftiOSTest6SomeVC 0x10bf1ed10gt ltTtC12SwiftiOSTest6SomeVC 0x10bf1ed10gt codepre  pc2 and c3 differ only in that it is not necessary to include the get ... for a computed property if it is only gettable.p  pSo, the first closures strongselfstrong seems to refer to the functionclosure type itself, whereas the other ones strongselfstrong refer to the view controller as I would expect. The only difference between c1 and c2c3 is that the former is a stored property, the latter are computed properties, but I would still expect the closures and their captured values be the same, i.e. strongselfstrong to always refer to the enclosing class. The way things are now, there seems to be no obvious way for the strongc1strong closure to access methods  properties of the enclosing class.p  pIs this something documented somewhere I read the Swift book and didnt find anything, or is it just a betacompiler bug of some kind, which should be filed somewherep

Negative 10491 pIm thinking about sending my apk to a few willing friends to have them help test my app. Some of them are developers, some are not. I would like to make it extremely easy for them to be able to send me a logcat of a crash.p  pI suppose I could give them a zip with a batch file, adb, and whatever adb needs to run. The batch could use adb to get a filtered logcat. However, I dont know much about logcats command line flags. What do I need to know about logcat to make this happen Im not even sure this is the best approach. This requires them to have their drivers installed and working and android debugging on... Things that some of my friends probably wouldnt do.p  pI think I could add my app to the market with a beta build, but this isnt something Ive ever done before. Would using the Android Market to distribute the beta allow me to knitpick my friends and only allow them to get my app Will they be able to send me feedback if they do thisp  pAre there other approaches I dont know of I would love if theres an ondevice solution that doesnt require them to plug into a computer or have a rooted device.p

There are a lot of these service methods that are essentially identical apart from the type of the input parameters and the type of the output.p  pI initially tried to refactor the methods to accept a codequeryResultscode argument that was an interface rather than a concrete class  a simple interface that just has an codeIdcode property  and then made codeClass1code and codeClass2code implement that interface. But then I need to make the return type of these methods nonconcrete too if I want to use just the one method. This is where I got stuck.p  pI have been looking around and have seen strongcovariancestrong and strongcontravariancestrong information, but I cant seem to define a methodinterface that uses these interfaces and a generic type without getting cannot resolve symbol T or Argument type XXX is not assignable to parameter type YYY.p  pAt this point I wanted to sanity check with those more familiar with this problem Is what I am trying to do possible Can I have methods that take an argument specified only by interface, and return from that method an object also only specified by an interfacep  pEDIT the criteria classes are pretty straightforward, and are actually complex types defined in the EF model. But heres a simplified examplep  precodepublic class Class1QueryCriteria    public string Id   public string Name   public class Class2QueryCriteria    public string Id   public string Category  codepre

Negative 10491 pI have implemented an HTML5 audio player on a webpage that uses standard ashx handlers to serve the .mp3 to the player.

Once deploying code to the production environment android works again but I loose iOS. p  pBased on what I have looked at so far it seems to be an issue in IIS.

Negative 10491 pIve been experimenting with docker recently but cant get my head around what I think is a fairly importantuseful requirementp  pThe ability to download a NEW copy of a web site for running, when a container is run. NOT at build time, but at run time.p  pI have seen countless examples of Dockerfiles where java, tomcat, a copy of a WAR is installed and added to an image during build time, but none where that WAR is downloaded fresh each time docker run d memyimage is executed on the command line.p  pI think it might involve adding a CMD statement at the end of the Dockerfile but I wonder if people out there more experienced than me with docker have some advice Perhaps I shouldnt even be attempting this and should rebuild my images each time my web app has a new release But that would mean I would have to distribute my new image via a private dockerhub or something right I am not willing to stick my source in a public github repo and have the Dockerfile pull it and build it during an image build. p  pThanks.p

Maybe my implementation has flaws The only number that has lower precision is the argument C that is taken from the Mandelbrot set and it has the precision required to capture it in the depth where it was set  I dont think that this matters because adding extra zeros to make the precision high wont change the result.

Negative 10491 pIf I have a codeUIButtoncode and give it a red background, and the background size is a little too small or too big for my liking but the tap target size is perfect, is there any way to change the size of thembr Basically the equivalent of adding padding in codeCSScode so that it either takes up more area or less Purely an aesthetic change.p  pSay with the background color applied to the button it visually takes up a code100px  30pxcode area. I want it to be code90px  25pxcode. Is this possiblep

Console log shows the correct html string based on my switch statement, however only the last item in the switch statement gets appended to target div.p  pFull code is here  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxo1h8quq relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netxo1h8quqap  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode document .readyfunction    var buildHtml  functionid      console.logid     var html     switch id        case gluten         html  ltpgtThis is why gluten sucksltpgt       case dairy         html  ltpgtThis is why dairy sucksltpgt       case soy         html  ltpgtThis is why soy sucksltpgt       case gmo         html  ltpgtThis is why gmo sucksltpgt       case preservatives         html  ltpgtThis is why preservatives suckltpgt       case fillers         html  ltpgtThis is why fillers suckltpgt       case sugars         html  ltpgtThis is why sugars suckltpgt          return html        .whyout .hover     function       console.logthis       var html  buildHtmlthis.id       whyoutpop.html       console.loghtml       whyoutpop.appendhtml.removeClasshide      , function        whyoutpop.html.addClasshide           codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode.hide    visibility hidden   whyoutpop    position absolute   margintop 158px   marginleft 30px   borderstyle solid   borderwidth 3px   borderradius 40px   bordercolor black   backgroundcolor c3c3c3   padding 10px   color black   textalign right   fontweight light   zindex 1000   .whyout    textalign right   fontweight bold  outhead    textalign right   fontweight bold codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetUTF8gt lttitlegtTest Seesterlttitlegt     ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcfuck.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt   ltdiv idoutsectiongt   ltdiv classwhyout idoutheadgtWHATS OUTltdivgt   ltbrgt   ltdiv classwhyout idglutengtGlutenGrain OUTltdivgt   ltbrgt   ltdiv classwhyout iddairygtDairy OUT ltdivgt   ltbrgt   ltdiv classwhyout idsoygtSoy OUT ltdivgt   ltdiv classwhyout idgmogtGMOs OUT ltdivgt   ltdiv classwhyout idpreservativesgtPreservatives OUT ltdivgt   ltdiv classwhyout idfillersgtFillers OUT ltdivgt   ltdiv classwhyout idsugarsgtRefined Sugars OUT ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classwhyout hide idwhyoutpopgt     ltpgtThis is a testltpgt ltdivgt  ltstylegt   ltstylegt ltbodygtcodepre div div p

Negative 10491 pI just read the a hrefhttpsgithub.comNetflixHystrixwikiHowitWorks relnofollowHystrixa guide and am trying to wrap my head around how the default circuit breaker and recovery period operate, and then how to customize their behavior.p  pObviously, if the circuit is tripped, Hystrix will automatically call the commands codegetFallBackcode method this much I understand. But what criteria go into making the circuit tripped in the first place Ideally, Id like to try hitting a backing service several times say, a max of 3 attempts before we consider the service to be offlineunhealthy and trip the circuit breaker. strongHow could I implement this, and wherestrongp  pBut I imagine that if I override the default circuit breaker, I must also override whatever mechanism handles the default recovery period. If a backing service goes down, it could be for any one of several reasonsp  ul liThere is a network outage between the client and serverli liThe service was deployed with a bug that makes it incapable of returning valid responses to the clientli liThe client was deployed with a bug that makes it incapable of sending valid requests to the serverli liSome weird, momentary service hiccup perhaps the service is doing a major garbage collection, etc.li lietc.li ul  pIn most of these cases, it is not sufficient to have a recovery period that merely waits emNem seconds and then tries again. If the service has a bug in it, or if someone pulled some network cables in the data center, we will emalwaysem get failures from this service. Only in a small number of cases will the clientservice automagically heal itself without any human interaction.p  pSo I guess my next question is partially strongHow do I customize the default recovery period strategystrong, but I guess it is mainly strongHow do I use Hystrix to notify devops when a service is down and requires manual interventionstrongp

Negative 10491 pI have a universal app that uses MFMailComposeViewController to send application feedback. The app contains several other components that users can launch themselves by clicking table view cells that list each component. The components are launched by using the navigation controllers codepushViewControllercode method. p  pHowever, with MFMailComposeViewController it is necessary to call codepresentViewControllercode from the view controller itself, not from the navigation controller. Once the MFMailComposeViewController is called, the UI suffers from layout issues until it is relaunched.p  pI suspect this is because MFMailComposeViewController inherits from UINavigationController and pushing another navigation controller onto the stack is causing a conflict.

Negative 10491 pI am currently working on connecting OGRE and SFML. SFML should be used for 2D drawing, network stuff and input.  OGRE is for the 3d Graphics.p  pCurrently the whole thing is on Linux.p  pWhat works Connecting OGRE and SFML. First I create a SFML Render Window, then I grab the handle of this window and give it to the OGRE Render WIndow while creating it. I can use the SFML Events now. Did not test the Network stuff, but I am sure this will work too.p  pWhat does not work Drawing in the SFML window.p  pCase 1 SFML and OGRE are not connected. OGRE does not have the SFML window handle and has its own window. SFML still cant draw in its own window The main loop executes a maximum of 3 times and then just stops. Nothing more happens. A few seconds later about 20 or so I get a Memory Access violation and the program ends.p  pCase 2 SFML and OGRE are connected. A similar thing happens The main loop executes exectly 53 times, nothing gets drawn and then the program stops with the terminal message aborted actually its Abgebrochen, because its in Germanp  pThe strange behaviour also happens, when I let SFML draw into a sfRenderTexture instead of the sfmlwindow.p  pHere is my codep  precodeinclude ltSFMLGraphics.hppgt include ltSFMLWindow.hppgt include ltSFMLSystem.hppgt include ltiostreamgt include ltOGREOgre.hgt include ltvectorgt include ltstdio.hgt  int mainint argc, char  argv[]   ifargc  1     return 1    start with 1 and you get 1 window, start with 0 and you get two bool together  atoiargv[1]      create the SFML window sfRenderWindow sfmlwindowsfVideoMode800, 600, test sfWindowHandle sfmlsystemhandle  sfmlwindow.getSystemHandle sfmlwindow.setVerticalSyncEnabledtrue stdcoutltltsfmlsystemhandleltltstdendl    init ogre OgreRoot  ogreroot  new OgreRoot, ,  stdvectorltOgreStringgt plugins plugins.pushbackusrlibx8664linuxgnuOGRE1.8.0RenderSystemGL  forauto p  plugins      ogrerootgtloadPluginp   const OgreRenderSystemListamp rendersystems  ogrerootgtgetAvailableRenderers  ifrendersystems.size  0      stdcerrltltno rendersystem foundltltstdendl     return 1    OgreRenderSystem  rendersystem  rendersystems[0] ogrerootgtsetRenderSystemrendersystem  ogrerootgtinitialise false, ,      create the ogre window OgreRenderWindow  ogrewindow NULL      OgreNameValuePairList parameters     parameters[FSAA]  0     parameters[vsync]  true       if started with 1, connect the windows     iftogether parameters[externalWindowHandle]  stdtostringsfmlsystemhandle     ogrewindow  ogrerootgtcreateRenderWindowogre window, 800, 600, false, ampparameters     ogre stuff OgreSceneManager  scene  ogrerootgtcreateSceneManagerOgreSTGENERIC, Scene OgreSceneNode  rootnode  scenegtgetRootSceneNode OgreCamera  cam  scenegtcreateCameraCam OgreSceneNode  camnode  rootnodegtcreateChildSceneNodecamnode camnodegtattachObjectcam  OgreViewport  vp  ogrewindowgtaddViewportcam vpgtsetAutoUpdatedfalse vpgtsetBackgroundColourOgreColourValue0, 1, 1  ogrewindowgtsetAutoUpdatedfalse ogrerootgtclearEventTimes  sfml image loading sfTexture ring stdcoutltltring loading ltltring.loadFromFilering.pngltltstdendl  sfSprite sprite sprite.setTexturering    main loop int counter  0 whileogrewindowgtisClosed ampamp sfmlwindow.isOpen      stdcoutltltcounterltltstdendl     counter     stdcoutltltaltltstdendl       sfml events     sfEvent event     whilesfmlwindow.pollEventevent              ifevent.type  sfEventClosed                      sfmlwindow.close                   stdcoutltltbltltstdendl       stdcoutltltcltltstdendl     ogrerootgtrenderOneFrame       stdcoutltltdltltstdendl         here the strange behaviour happens      if this line draw isnt present, everything works     sfmlwindow.pushGLStates     sfmlwindow.drawsprite     sfmlwindow.popGLStates       vpgtupdate     stdcoutltlteltltstdendl     sfmlwindow.display       only needs to be done for separated windows      sfml display updates otherwise, both use double buffering     iftogether ogrewindowgtupdatetrue  return 0  codepre  pHelp would be really appreciated.p  pEDIT I added the pushGLStates and popGLStates commands, forgot those earlierp
Negative 10491 pIn my meteor app, I am using ironrouters codewaitOncode method to subscribe to all relevant documents and the codedatacode method to return just one documents contents to the template as a reactive variable. Since these documents are large, I want to load just one at a time as a reactive variable for speed concerns.p  precode  ...   waitOn function       subscribe to ohlcOneMin, ohlcThreeMin, etc.     return Meteor.subscribethis.params.exchange, this.params.market   ,   data function      return        ohlc WidgetsExchangesBtcchina.findOnemarket this.params.market, dataTypeohlcOneMin        ,   ... codepre  pBy default on route load, ironrouter will store data from the codeohlcOneMincode document under the codeRouter.current.data.ohlccode reactive variable. And that works great in my template. Now, imagine I have a button in my template. On click, it would change the ironrouter data source to the contents of the codeohlcThreeMincode document... essentially toggling ironrouters codeRouter.current.datacode reactive variable between different document data which the user is subscribed to, without having to reload the route or have all the data from all the documents stored in a reactive variable at the same time. How can this be achieved Thanksp
Negative 10491 pIm trying to add the androidsupportv7appcompat library to a project that I work on with several others.  Im using Eclipse with ADT for my IDE setup.  For the time being, Android Studio is not available for us to use if it were, I would have been past this issue several hours ago But that is how it is for us unfortunately.p  pHow do I go about doing this  Ive read in several places that I am supposed to import the androidsupportv7appcombat project in Eclipse, build this, and then reference this project in the Android section of the project Properties.p  pThis does work, but Im wondering how this is supposed to work when I share this project with others  is everyone required to have the androidsupportv7appcompat project setup at the same location as I did in order to have this work  I was hoping I could include the jar file with my project somehow. And not have it as an external reference... if that makes sense.p  pFor what its worth, Im using the appcompat library to use the Toolbar widget and the AppCompat theme for an application I am looking to run on a range of API level devices.  p  pThanks,p  pZachp

Negative 10491 pI have a Javascript library.  It currently uses a synchronous XMLHttmpRequest to get information from the server, caches the result, and has functions which create objects based on input to the function and the cached data.  These functions could conceivably cause another synchronous request, but this is extremely rare after the initial page load.p  pSynchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detremental effects to the end users experience.p  pAll the examples Ive found say Use a callback when the resource is loaded.  But the functions which could trigger the load are used in a large number of places, the majority of which cannot be readily modified to say Call this and continue when you have a value.  Altering that particular behavior would be a substantial architecture change I cannot afford at this time.p  pWhat I really want is block until the XMLHttpRequest is done or errored, a thing I can no longer do in the main UI.  strongI feel like there should be some way to use callbacks within my library to accomplish this, without changing the library interface, but I cant figure one out.strongp  pIve couched the question in general terms, now Ill give some specifics.  The library generates and manipulates date objects for time systems other than the current browsers.p  precodevar foo  new dateLibrary.dateutime, EtcUTC codepre  pIf it has not had a call using that time system, it does a load and parse of the time system prior to creating and returning the date object.  It is then used on a d3 and SVG using page to create nicelooking, rich displays.  Turning it into something of the formp  precodedateLibrary.dateutime, EtcUTC, callbackUsingResultdate codepre  pwill require reaching into the guts of d3 or abandoning its ability to use generate time axis information.p

Negative 10491 pAs the title says, I am trying to codeINNER JOINcode on columns that have different valuesdata types. p  pIn one database table, lets call it Table A I want to do a select statement to get the values of a few columns Subject, Name, Description, Date. Though I also want a relation name. The problem is however that the relation name which is set in the relation table, Table B is displayed in Table A as a string value D0001001  so not as a literal name. p  pTo get the literal relation name there is a link with Table B that has an ID column 1001  1000 and a relation literal name column. So for example in table B ID 1001 matches company name MC DONALDS and in table A the RelationID is D0001001 MC DONALDS.  p  pDont ask me why the RelationID in table A is with the weird D000 in front of it,  I dont know either but it had some functionality. p  pSo back to the problem. I want to get a few fields from table A but also the literal relation name from table B where it matches the table A relationID values.  p  pSo the question is, how can I codeINNER JOINcode on these 2 different valuestypes codeRelationIDcode in table A is of string type codenvarcharcode to be precise and in Table B the codeIDcode that matches the relation name is an codeIntegercode type. p  pI thought I could fix it byp  ol lipDo a LIKE statement in the query where the ID of table B 1001 integer partly matches the RelationID of table A D0001001 string. This however didnt work pli lipdo a codeREPLACEcode statement by replacing the RelationID D000 values by nothing .

I did some investigation and testing and found out it cant initialize the device, where we use the following logic this is from my test program, but the real logic is equivalentp  precodeprotected bool ResetDeviceUsbDevice Device      Console.WriteLineFirst ensure that the EZUSB 8051 is RESET CPUCS1     if ControlTransferDevice, new byte[]  1          return false      Console.WriteLine Then allow the EZUSB CPU to reenumerate CPUCS0     if ControlTransferDevice, new byte[]  0          return false      Console.WriteLineReset done...     return true   public bool ControlTransferUsbDevice Device, byte[] data, short value  null      int written     var setupPacket  SetupPacketvalue     return Device.ControlTransferref setupPacket, data, data.Length, out written  internal UsbSetupPacket SetupPacketshort value  null      var controlPacket  new UsbSetupPacket     controlPacket.Request  0xA0     controlPacket.RequestType  64     controlPacket.Value  value  0x07F92     controlPacket.Index  0      return controlPacket  codepre  pI then used an USB analyzer to profile the commands sent via the USBPort.br Using Windows I get the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGzejW.png altWindowsbr which is correct and as you can see the device resets an can be used, but when using Linux I get the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHEYuR.png altLinux Now instead of code01code and code00code the command sends code68code and codeA8code and so the device does nothing.p  pstrongDoes anyone have an idea what could be the reason of thatstrong Why does it send the wrong data packet under Linuxp

Negative 10491 pIve gotten some great feedback from Stackoverflow and wanted to check on one more idea.  p  pCurrently Ive got a webapp that runs nodejs on a PAAS Heroku and trying out bluemix.  The server is being configured to talk to a Couchdb hosted on cloudant.  There are two types of data saved to the db, first, user data each user will have its own database, and second, app data itself metrics, user account info authadmin stuff.  p  pAfter some great feedback from here, the idea is that after the user logs in, they will sync there local browser pouchdb instance with Cloudant probably proxied through my server as was recommended here.  p  pNow the question is, for the appadmin data, maybe I run a couchdb instance on my server so im not making repeated network calls for things like user logins, metrics data, etc.  The data would not be very big, and is already separated from the user data calls.  The point is to have a fasterlocal instance for authentication mainly, changesupdates get synced outside of user requests.p  pThe backend is in express web framework and it looks like my options are pouchdb.... to sync to the Cloudant instance  p  pIf I want local db access backed a Couchdb instance, on a nodeexpress server running on a PAAS, is that the recommended setupp  pThanks vm for any feedback, Paulp

Negative 10491 pIm trying to make my app more accessible and so far the standard accessibility things like labels and hints are doing wonders. Im hitting a problem however with dynamically updating content thats displayed in a UITableView.p  pEach row of the table updates every second or so, but if I try to create each cells accessibilityLabel at this point then I find that there is a problem with the VoiceOver reading out the selected label keeps interrupting itself as the label contents changes so the system just starts reading the label content from the beginning again actually an odd quirk shows the voice over sometimes works correctly for the first cell that was selected, but upon selecting a new cell this bug returns.p  pIve tried to see if theres anyway to try and understand whether VoiceOver is currently active but as far as I can see there is only a notification posted when VoiceOver finishesp  precodeUIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidFinishNotification codepre  pTheres no equivalent notification for when VoiceOver begins. So theres no way for my TableViewController to know that VoiceOver is currently active and that it shouldnt update any accessibilityLabels.p  pId hoped I could at least detect that one of my TableView cells was the selected accessibilityElement using thep  precodeaccessibilityElementIsFocused codepre  pmethod. However in all my testing Ive not been able to see this reliably fire for a custom UITableViewCell.p  pI also tried implementing the getter for accessibilityLabel for my custom cell hoping this may work, but sadly the same behaviour occurs.p  pThe only solution Im left with is a user configurable frequency for dynamic content accessibility updates, say 5, 10, 20 seconds... which can block me updating my label until I know that the last changed content would have definitely been read out. Actually even this could be interrupted if the user chose to select a cell at say 8 seconds after the last update, 2 seconds in for a 10 second limit and the label would update causing the voice over to restart.p  pHas anyone any ideas of how best to handle this dynamic updating content Im presuming the tableview cells are complicating matters a little, but in general I just dont understand how apple expects you to handle dynamic content. All it needs to solve this is another notificationp  precodeUIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidStartNotification codepre  pOr even better a method to enquire as to whether VoiceOver is currently active. But I dont seem to be able to find anyp  pThanks for your time, would really appreciate any tips on this. Cheersp

Negative 10491 pIm currently implementing a web service for my node application. I started with websockets and got everything up and running rather quickly. The only issues Im having is the fact that I cannot send messages to the server using oneliners using the terminal. p  pI tried a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackagewscat relnofollowwscata but it requires multiple commands and actual manual input. I want to talk to the websockets programmatically. The alternative is running a REST service next to it, but imo thats a waste of resources. p  pHaving something like codecurl H ContentType applicationjson X POST d fakedata,datafake httplocalhost9022code for websockets would simply be awesome, but it does not seem possible from terminal, or am I missing something strongOne command to open the connection, send the message, get the reply optional, and close the connection.strongp  pI will create a web GUI for this as well, but I really want to have the ease of use of terminal commands.p

Negative 10491 pSorry, lots of context before the actual question as weve throughly researched this and I wanted to give you full context.p  pstrongSome contextstrong postgres indexonlyscans rely on the visibility map VM. If a page is not marked as notfullyvisible in the visibility map, postgres fetches that page to ensure the data is visible to this transaction, even when doing index only scans. Unfortunately, this can greatly slowdown index only scans. The index might return results from 10k rows, but the index itself only spans 50 pages very fast in terms of IO. However, if VM isnt set, it makes and extra 10k heap fetches 200x slower in terms of IO.p  pstrongDetailsstrong a hrefhttpswiki.postgresql.orgwikiIndexonlyscansTheVisibilityMap.28andotherrelationforks.29 relnofollowhttpswiki.postgresql.orgwikiIndexonlyscansTheVisibilityMap.28andotherrelationforks.29ap  pstrongTry it yourselfstrong EXPLAIN ANALYZE an index only query, before and after a VACUUM. You can see the number of heap fetches go down after the VACUUM assuming you had some dirty pages in the VM beforep  pstrongAlready triedstrong Were already tuned autovacuum, and were vacuuming regularly. This helps a lot, but wed like to get even faster.p  pstrongQuestion finallystrong Is it possible to skip heap fetches when doing index only scans Im aware we wouldnt have perfect MVCC when reading, but were okay with that. The data in the index is close enough, and its definitely not worth the overhead of thousands of heap fetches to make sure were not looking at slightly stale data. To borrow a term from NoSQL, wed be fine with eventual consistency reads.p  pThanksp

Negative 10491 pI am new to mobile development. In my application Ive got a table which shows the recipes created by the user. A cell is designed as a nibfile with an image which is asynchronously loaded and 2 labels. Everything seems ok on the simulator.

So also not included in the tfs will be not copied and not exist. For example, I have AppData folder and I dont include some files from that folder.

There is a view with a simple form like thisp  precode simpleformfor message, url [admin, request, message], html  class form verticalform do f    f.input text, as text, inputhtml  class formcontrol, rows 5    br    f.input linkurl, inputhtml  class formcontrol    br    if message.haspictureimage      f.label image     linkto message.pictureimage, target blank do      imagetag message.pictureimagethumb      f.filefield image, classimagenbutton      f.inputfield removepicture, as boolean, inlinelabel Remove   br    .formactions      f.submittaccept, class btn btnlarge btnprimary      linktotcancel, [admin, message.request, message], class btn btnlarge btndanger codepre  pand in Message model there is the bellow methodp  precodedef removepicture   self.picture.destroy end codepre  pThe codeinputfieldcode is used to check if I want to remove the message image if it exists. I understood that codeinputfiledcode gives me the option to check it so that when I click on codeacceptcode button, it call the method removepicture in the Message model. But, before the browser deploys the form, it rise the next errorp  precodeundefined method toi for ltPicture0x007f7675162b58gt  Extracted source around line 39  37       imagetag message.pictureimagethumb 38     f.filefield image, classimagenbutton 39     f.inputfield removepicture, as boolean, inlinelabel Remove 40  br 41  .formactions 42     f.submittaccept, class btn btnlarge btnprimary codepre  pand if I reload the page, this time the form is deployed. I guess this is because in the first time, as the picture exists then immediatly the coderemovepicturecode is called and the picture removed, and when I reload the form, as the picture already does not exist, the form is shown.p  pObviously I am undestanding wrongly the inputfield usage. p

Negative 10491 pI am trying to write C code that takes serialport data from a high speed GPS device and parse the data to grab coordinates. p  pThe problem with this compared to other serial GPS devices is that it spits out 56 lines of data every 100 milliseconds instead of the same every second. So basically, every 0.1 seconds, I get 5 or 6 lines of data burst, which will last continuously as long as the device is turned on. p  pWhen I tried it on a simulated standardspeed GPS device, it works just fine. p  pThis is me getting a 5 line burst once every second.

Negative 10491 pI am trying to center a list of floating elements, but since its a masonry I cant make them codeinlinecode. A container would be needed, that much is obvious, but I couldnt find anywhere how do make it do thisp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comU5B0MKr.gif altp  pIgnore the margins here, they dont matter, its just so each separate child element can be seen. And yes, the parent isnt centered, but it could be. The important part is that it dynamically fits the child elements and its width isnt 100 all the time.p  pAlready tried floating the parent, in that case the child elements only make a single column.p
Negative 10491 pOk folks, this is a rather specific one.p  pFirst off, I am trying to unit test the controller that is being passed to an a hrefhttpsmaterial.angularjs.orglatestapimaterial.components.dialogservicemdDialog relnofollowAngular Material Dialoga instance.p  pAs a general question, does it make more sense to test such a controller separately, or by actually invoking mdDialog.showp  pI am attempting the first method, but Im running into some issues, mostly related to how Angular Material binds the locals to the controller.p  pHere is the code that I am using to invoke the dialog in my source code, which works as expectedp  precodemdDialog.show     controller DeviceDetailController,     controllerAs vm,     locals deviceId 123,     bindToController true,     templateUrl adminviewsdeviceDetail.html,     parent angular.elementdocument.body,     targetEvent event  codepre  pI dont believe the a hrefhttpsmaterial.angularjs.orglatestapimaterial.components.dialogservicemdDialogshow relnofollowdocsa have been updated, but as of version 0.9.0 or so, the locals are available to the controller at the time the constructor function is called see a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularmaterialissues1534issuecomment98536797 relnofollowthis issue on Githuba. Here is a strippeddown version of the controller constructor function under test, so you can see why I need the variable to be passed in and available when the controller is instantiatedp  precodefunction DeviceDetailControllerdevicesService      var vm  this      vm.device       vm.deviceId  null           this field is injected when the dialog is created, if there is one. For some reason I cant preassign it to null.      activate           function activate          if vm.deviceId  null              loadDevice                    function loadDevice          devicesService.getDeviceByIdvm.deviceId             .thenfunctiondata                  vm.device  data.collection                    codepre  pI am trying to test that the device is assigned to vm.device when a deviceId is passed in to the constructor function before it is invoked.p  pThe test jasmine and sinon, run by karma     describeDeviceDetailController, function          var controllerConstructor, scope, mockDevicesServicep  precode    beforeEachmoduleadmin      beforeEachinjectfunction controller, rootScope          mockDevicesService  sinon.stub             getDeviceById function                    controllerConstructor  controller         scope  rootScope.new           itshould get a device from devicesService if passed a deviceId, function          var mockDeviceId  3         var mockDevice  onlyIWouldHaveThis true         var mockDeviceResponse  collection [mockDevice]         var mockDevicePromise               then function cb                  cbmockDeviceResponse                                var mockLocals  deviceId mockDeviceId, scope scope          mockDevicesService.getDeviceById.returnsmockDevicePromise          var ctrlConstructor  controllerConstructorDeviceDetailController as vm, mockLocals, true         angular.extendctrlConstructor.instance, mockLocals         ctrlConstructor          expectscope.vm.deviceId.toBemockDeviceId         expectscope.vm.device.toEqualmockDevice       codepre  pWhen I run this, the first assertion passes and the second one fails Expected Object  to equal Object onlyIWouldHaveThis true ., which shows me that deviceId is being injected into the controllers scope, but apparently not in time for the if clause in the activate method to see it. p  pYou will notice that I am trying to mimic the basic procedure that a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularmaterialblobmastersrccoreservicescompilercompiler.jsL115 relnofollowAngular Materiala uses by calling controller with the third argument set to true, which causes a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularangular.jsblobv1.4.5srcngcontroller.jsL86 relnofollowcontrollera to return the controller constructor function, as opposed to the resulting controller. I should then be able to extend the constructor with my local variables just as Angular Material does in the code linked to above, and then invoke the constructor function to instantiate the controller.p  pI have tried a number of things, including passing an isolate scope to the controller by calling rootScope.newtrue, to no effect I actually cant say I fully understand isolate scope, but mdDialog uses it by default.p  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 10491 pI have a custom SQL database in which we have stored different prices per customer per product and per quantity. p  pNow we want to setup a Magento web store and found out that we cannot really import those prices into Magento because it does not match in terms of data structure. And Magento would probably melt down because of the huge amounts of data we whould throw at it. p  pSo Im thinking can I leave the data where it is, setup a service on top of that data, and just override some GetPrice method within Magento to get the right price That right price should then of course show up in every possible page that shows prices. And, even more important, that price should be used in baskets and orders too.p  pMy question is A Would it work like that Just overriding one method and we have custom pricing Or do we have to alter many more methods p  pAnd B Where can I find that codemethod to override p  pMagento is quite new for me. And did spend half a day looking through tons of source code, but im not yet that confident with the whole application that i could anwers my own questions by looking through the code.p
