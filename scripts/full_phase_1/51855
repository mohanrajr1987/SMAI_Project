Positive 51855 pI need help figuring out how to get CarrierWave to work with an ActiveResource object.  I am working on a project that currently uses CarrierWave on a standard ActiveRecord object which works very nicely.  However, we are migrating toward a remote file system so I need CarrierWave to work with ActiveResource objects.p  pI know that CarrierWave allows you to write your own storage engine rather than use say fog, file, or mongo gridfs but I cant figure out what the flow for this process is.  p  pHere is the state of my effortsp  pReportDocument classp  precodeclass ReportDocument    mountuploader merchantgeoipimage, ImageUploader  end codepre  pUploader for CarrierWavep  precodeclass ImageUploader lt CarrierWaveUploaderBase    storage MyCustomStorageEngine  end codepre  pMy custom storage enginep  precodeclass MyCustomStorageEngine    def storefile     do custom storage stuff with ActiveResource object here   end    def retrieveidentifier     do custom retrieval stuff with ActiveResource object here   end  end codepre  pMy issue is that I cant get CarrierWave to call my custom codestorecode and coderetrievecode methods when I save the codeReportDocumentcode object.

Positive 51855 pIm having some issues with creating a Mongoid document that includes an emarrayem of custom objects.p  pI my particular case I intend to store an array of codeBaseDevicecode objects. The codeBaseDevicecode class is already mongified and serializes fromto a plain hash using Mongoids a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgecosystemtutorialrubymongoidtutorialfields relnofollowcustom fieldsa support. This works pretty well on single object.p  pFor storing an array of codeBaseDevicecode, Ive created the following classp  precodeclass BaseDeviceArray lt Array   class ltlt self       def demongoizeobject       object  object.map obj BaseDevice.demongoize obj   new     end      def evolveobject       case         when BaseDeviceArray then object.mongoize         else object       end     end   end    def mongoize     self.mapampmongoize   end end codepre  pThe mongoid document looks like thisp  precodeclass MongoPeriph   include MongoidDocument   field devices, type BaseDeviceArray end codepre  pLets say codesomedevicescode is an array containing two codeBaseDevicecode instances.  What happens is the following when I assign codesomedevicescode to the devices fields of the codeMongoPeriphcode instance that works correctly. p  precodemp  MongoPeriph.create mp.devices  somedevices mp.devices  gt [ltBaseDevice0x007fa84bac0080gt,ltBaseDevice0x007fa84baaff78gt] codepre  pWhen try to send codepushcode, codepopcode, codeshiftcode, codeunshiftcode methods to the devices field within the mongoid document, nothing seems to happen. The changes are not appearing on the codempcode object. Also when referencing one of the objects by index i.e. when calling codemp.devices[0].somemethodcode the world does not change. p  pWhen empoppingem objects from the array, on every codepopcode a new object is given. This is expected as the deserializer is instantiating a new codeBaseDevicecode object for every codepopcode, but the internal field is not updated i.e. the object stays there and one can pop endlessly.p  pUsing the codeBaseDeviceArraycode separate from a mongoid document works as expectedp  precodefoo  BaseDeviceArray.new foo ltlt BaseDevice.new codepre  presults in an array with a BaseDevice object. p  pBtw. I found one other a hrefhttpgrokbase.comtggmongoid1287rw4f78creatingarrayfieldsofspecificandcustomtypes relnofollowapproacha to this on the net.

Negative 51855 pIm trying to build a rectangular grid that can wrap around at the edges.  Anyone who plays video games will probably be familiar with the concept go far enough in one direction on the world map and youll end up back where you started.  This causes some difficulty in setting up the viewport, though, since the edges can scroll into negative coordinate territory.p  pIts easy enough to take a negative coordinate and determine its real valuep  precodefunction GetRealCoordsvalue TPoint TPoint begin    result  ModPointsAddPointsvalue, MAPSIZE, MAPSIZE end codepre  pwhere AddPoints and ModPoints simply apply the codecode and codemodcode operators, respectively, to each coordinate of the two inputs to produce an output value.p  pThe trouble is reversing this operation.  Given a point in which both coordinates are positive and a TRect in which the Top and Left values could be positive or negative, and the Bottom or Right could be beyond the edges of the map, and with MAPSIZE declared at global scope, is there any way to determine whether the point falls within the territory covered by the viewing rectangle without having to run the same calculation up to four different timesp

Negative 51855 pIm building an Applescript that will scan my network every X minutes, checking for my houses Xbox360 or PS3 and enabling my Transmission BitTorrent client SpeedLimit Mode when either console is online.p  pCurrently I can only Pause all transfers or resume all transfers using applescript, as there are separate keycommands for startstop transfer. I want it to go into speedlimit mode though, not stop completely.p  pMy issue is that the SpeedLimit Turtle mode is the same key to turn it onoff.  If anyone touches the speedlimit manually, it will be out of sync and will actually turn speedlimit off when the consoles come online. Also if one console comes online, the speedlimit will come on, but then if the other console comes on, the limit will be turned off.p  pThe menu item becomes checked when the speedlimit is active, but I do not know how to test for this.

Negative 51855 pI have the I2C SMBus working properly in this uC and have a VB GUI which can communicate over USB using USBXpress and do I2C transactions from the uC to a separate IC. The problem is that I am having the uC poll a register on the IC every 1s. When I do an asynchronous GUI I2C transaction, every once in a while, I believe it collides with the polling I2C transaction and all the I2C data gets shifted at the GUI i.e., register 0x00s data shows up on register 0x01 . The I2C data in the IC looks correct by spying on the I2C bus with a LA. What exactly is happening and how can I fix thisp
Negative 51855 pI am dealing with database tables with tens of millions of rows with the potential to go to the hundreds of millions over time, and am looking at implementing database partitioning to try to keep performance stable as the row count increases. This is what Id like to dop  pSay I have a table that stores animals. One of the fields is the AnimalType i.e. BirdFishCatDog.  Id like each AnimalType to be a separate partition, because 99 of queries only ever relate to one AnimalType amp there is roughly an equal amount of AnimalTypes in the table i.e. 1000 fish, 1000 birds, 1000 dogs so it means the partitions should be nice and evenly spread. However, there are stronga lotstrong of animal types, and I dont want to go and manually create the hundreds of partitions for each AnimalType, and then every time a new AnimalType is entered have to create a new partition.p  pTherefore, what I would like, is some way to tell SQL Server to partition based on AnimalType. If there is a partition already for the AnimalType, use that partition, otherwise SQL Server will automatically create a new partition.p  pIt sounds simple enough, but I cannot seem to find a way to do this. Is it possiblep  pstrongAlternativelystrong, what are some other methods to keep table access speeds nice and fast  Id like to avoid anything that is just manually moving stuff into more tables, such as moving older records into a History style table, as there is the potential for queries to need data from the full data set and hence this wont actually help.  I already have some basic Indexes which help significantly.p

The rss feed, in this case, was about 500 characters long.p  pTo create the scrolled string, I simply addremove characters as the come intooutof view using panel width amp character sizes to determine the time to addremove characters from the string on the display panel. It works very well but is using 200M of memory. The string is never more that about 80 characters long Ive made sure of this by using an alert if it exceeds 80 chars. The amount of characters in the string is dependant, of course, on the size of the font.p  pIf I comment out the DrawText command, the app uses little memory proving that its not some other part of the code. If I just scroll the entire string 500 chars the memory used is only 32M. However, Im now using lots of Proc scrolling such a large string.p  pIve noticed that when you draw a static not scrolling large string and then follow it with, say, a single character string, DrawText does not free the memory used to draw the large string. Im using theString.Remove amp theString.Insert to create the string to be scrolled.

Negative 51855 pI tried numerous times over the last few weeks to get a server side MVC 2 view to work with objects with nested IList elements without much success.  I am missing some fundamental understanding that I hope this question resolves.p  pWhat I want is a form that shows a list of product where you can change information inline, including a hierarchy a list of product that each has a list of subproducts, that each has a list of images, etc.  I am trying to recreate an older MS Access form where the big form has a list of products and subforms show the related products, all allowing inline edits.  Access saves each record upon focusing on a different record.p  pSay you have a Domain Model that looks like thisp  precodepublic class Product      ...  Lots of fields like public string name get set     public IListltDepartmentgt departments get set     public IListltSubProductgt subProducts get set  public class SubProduct      ...  Lots of fields like public string name get set     public IListltImagegt images get set  public class Image      ...  Lots of fields like public string name get set  codepre  pAnd a view Model that looks like thisp  precodepublic class EditProduct      IListltProductgt products get set  codepre  pIn the MVC 2 View, how would you code the Edit fields so that you can post the single model back to the controller  I am familiar with thep  precodeltinput idproducts[0].subProducts[0].images[0].name ... gt codepre  pmechanic, but each IList needs a way to CRUD elements on the same screen.  Its a big data entry screen where speed counts as much as being able to see all products in a list.  I need Add buttons, Delete buttons, and a means to post the entire form after editing any inputs.p  pIf I look at it from a JQuery point of viewp  ul liI serialize the Model as JSON for the initial form for the first N number of IList elementsli liI load on the fly additional products in the same list when they reach the bottom of the container divli liI accept the entire Model upon savepost or accept pieces of the same form for individual entities, like having a separate html form tag for each IList elementli ul  pBut for some reason, I am just not getting how to do this at the server side.  Any links or example code for the View itself would be great.  Elements without IList seems to work great, especially with UI templates.  Would I create a bunch of individual html form tags around each editable entity and have posts only deal with one element at a timep

Negative 51855 pIm trying to develop an alternative rating system for athletic results. Were all aware  of the traditional first past the post rating system for races. Think of the 100m final in the Olympics. First gets gold, second silver, etc. This system only benefits the top three.p  pIn my system, there is a seriesleague of races, where all eight runners race eight times against each other. I want to consider the age category and standard of the runners as well as the final position when rating their individual performance per race. Since we record the results, previous results can also be considered. The aim of the rating system is to keep runners at the lower end of the table competitive in later races, while also raising the bar to elite runners as they progress through the series.p  pMy current thinking is that at the start of each race, each runner is assigned 1 point. In terms of distributing points after a race, im thinking each runner can get gain or lose .1 points for each category we rate.p  pFor race position, the winner beats all others, so gets .1  7 and ends up with 1.7 points. The slowest, is dropped to .3 points.p  pWe then look at the age category, and same rule is applied, if you beat someone younger you gain .1 and they lose .1 of a point. p  pOnce all the categories have been processed, we position the runners based on the points.p  pIn the second race, the same process happens. An extra category is now considered, we compare the runner points against their last result. Lets assume the same runner wins the first two races, they have the same points, but because they didnt beat their previous points, they lose a point to the slowest person. p  pThe same process repeats for all races, until the end, when the most consistent runner is identified. Im wondering has anybody come across anything like this in other sport ranking systems Am i making this too complicatedp  p EDIT 1 p  pRather than giving each runner one point at the start of each, and then transfering the points between runners based the categories, an alternative is to say each category has a set of points, and then divide these points to each set of runners that match the criteria.p  pThis is similar to a soccer league, where each match has 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw or zero for losing. The teams compete to win the points in a category.p  p EDIT 2 p  pI found this topic called the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSwisssystemtournament relnofollowSwiss Modela which is used for chess ranking. While this system assumes a player vs player competition and a division of points based on the result. I think this can be extended to eight runners against eight runners in an event, we then consider each individual result between the runners.   p  p EDIT 3 p  pThe a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIRBWorldRankings relnofollowIRB World Rankingsa and its a hrefhttpwww.irb.comrankingsexplainindex.html relnofollowexplainationa seem to match what im trying to. Each runner starts with 40 points, based in the size of winsdefeats we transfer points between runners. A slow runner having one good race would take a lot of points from the fastest runner. Running slow isnt rewarded either.p
Negative 51855 pGiven a view hierarchy that looks something like thisp  precodeContainerView   UIScrollView     ModuleView     ModuleView     ModuleView     ... codepre  pId like the codeContainerViewcode to lay the codeModuleViewscode out in some arbitrary fashion list, grid etc.. To do this, Id implement code[ContainerView layoutSubviews]code which would iterate through the codeModuleViewscode, call code[ModuleView sizeToFit]code on each one, and then position them relative to one another according to the desired layout.p  pMy question is to do with the best way of implementing code[ModuleView sizeThatFits]code and code[ModuleView layoutSubviews]code to minimise repetition and to allow codeModuleViewscode to change size while maintaining the layout correctly.p  pTake the simplest case where codeModuleViewcode is a codeUIViewcode with a multiline codeUILabelcode subview, and padding on either side. It might look something like thisp  precodeimplementation ModuleView   CGSizesizeThatFitsCGSizesize    CGFloat padding  10.0f   CGSize labelMaxSize  CGSizeMakesuperview.size.width  2  padding, CGFLOATMAX   CGSize labelSize  [self.label.text sizeWithFontself.label.font constrainedToSizelabelMaxSize lineBreakModeself.label.lineBreakMode]   return CGSizeMakesuperview.width, labelSize.height  2  padding    voidlayoutSubviews    [super layoutSubviews]    CGFloat padding  10.0f   CGSize labelMaxSize  CGSizeMakeself.size.width  2  padding, CGFLOATMAX   CGSize labelSize  [self.label.text sizeWithFontself.label.font constrainedToSizelabelMaxSize lineBreakModeself.label.lineBreakMode]   self.label.frame  CGRectMakepadding, padding, labelSize.width, labelSize.height    CGRect frame  self.frame   frame.size.height  self.label.frame.size.height  2  padding   self.frame  frame   end codepre  pAs you can see, the size of the subviews is calculated once in codesizeThatFitscode, and again in codelayoutSubviewscode. This works, but quickly becomes a mess when the views are more complicated.p  pIs there a way to simplify this I havent been able to find good examples of how others approach this problem.p

But the problem is since we are not maintaining any session information in our initial POST request, it always redirects to the login screenp  pIs there any way to maintain ASP.NET session information between multiple calls done programmatically Can we create an ASP.NET session id cookie programmatically and then pass it along with our initial requestp  pOr this is not possible at allp  pAny comments are appreciated.p  pThanks for your help.p  pRegards.p

Negative 51855 pCan anyone tell me how I could go about authenticating with the various OAuth login mechanisms on the internets Twitter, Facebook so that I can run scripts against these services. p  pAs an example, right now when I use Facebook data I goto graph.facebook.com and copy paste the access key from the URL. Obviously this is a bad approach, it has sufficed for now, but is not really an option anymore  p  pIve checked out the documentation on the facebook site in particular which requests that I use a callback urL and so on.

Negative 51855 pOne strategy that I though of myself is allocating 5 megabytes of memory or whatever number you feel necessary at the program startup.p  pThen when at any point programs codemalloccode returns codeNULLcode, you free the 5 megabytes and call codemalloccode again, which will succeed and let the program continue running.p  pWhat do you think about this strategyp  pAnd what other strategies do you knowp  pThanks, Boda Cydo.p
Negative 51855 pIve used the selfshunt unit testing pattern a few times over the years. As I was explaining it to someone recently they argued that it violated the SRP. The argument is that the test class can now be changed for one of two reasons when the test changes, or when the method signature on the interface that the test is implementing changes. After thinking about it for a while, it seems like this is a correct assessment, but I wanted to get other peoples opinions.

Negative 51855 pI am writing a game in android using Box2d physics engine in NDK. So physics is entirely in the native world but the drawing is still in Java world.p  pIn my game I have an update thread that steps the physics world and invalidates the canvas for redraw. So far so good. When the user wishes to pause the game I stop all the threads. Then user is given an option to Resume the game which would restart the threads and the game would begin from where it stopped.p  pFor some reason, when the game is resumed the bodies in the physics move faster. Why would anything change for a body if its time stepping is stoppped and restarted  p  pIs there an issue with calling step again after making a pause  does the bodys velocity, masss, friction , density change after a brief pause.p  pAny help is appreciated Thanksp

Negative 51855 pI am using Cs inbuilt drag and drop via Control.DoDragDrop.  I use an Image List and ImageListDragMove and friends to move a semitransparent image around, tracking with the mouse.  See my reply in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3240603cdraganddropshowthedraggeditemwhiledragging36651353665135this threada for more information.  How can I make the ImageList track the mouse when it is emoutsideem my windows  I only receive mouse position messages in OnDragOver, and only when the mouse is over one of my Windows.  The drag is going to another instance of my application, and I would like the ImageList to go the whole way, including over the desktop.  I guess the basic problem is that DoDragDrop runs its own little message loop.p  pWindows Explorer gets this done so I know it is possible.  I suppose I could start a thread to keep track of the mouse or write my own dragdrop message loop, but I am hoping for an easier way.p

Negative 51855 pIm still wrapping my head around some of the nuances of memory management in objectiveC, and came up with the following case Im unsure aboutp  precode NSDecimalNumberfactorial NSDecimalNumber l       NSDecimalNumber index  l     NSDecimalNumber running  [NSDecimalNumber one]      for  [index intValue] gt 1 index  [index decimalNumberBySubtracting[NSDecimalNumber one]]          running  [running decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy index]          return running  codepre  pHere decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy and decimalNumberBySubtracting will be creating a lot of NSDecimalNumbers, which will get autoreleased eventually as I understand it, but I worry until that time the containing program will be hanging unto an awful lot of memory.p  pShould I be introducing an autorelease pool somewhere  If so where  Is that going to have a noticeable effect on performance when compared to the side effect of so much memory in usep  pIs autoreleasing the right mechanism to use here  Should I look at breaking the loop apart and manually releasing memory as Im done with itp  pIts likely a n00b question, but Im trying to get a flavour for what the best practices isare in this situation.p

Negative 51855 pI am currently trying to change some settings in a .pptx files via C and codeMicrosoft.Office.Interop.PowerPointcode.

For instance, say on your original edit you moved the upperleft Google tile from its original position and placed it underneath the YouTube tile.p  pThen, when you come back, and mouse over the position on the browser window where the Google tile used to be, you can still click through as if it was still there.

Negative 51855 pI run a website which shows related articles widget that people can add on their websites. p  pCurrently what my system does when a link is clicked in that widget it redirects to a link on my website and then redirects it back to related article that was clicked on. This process is to record the statistics for clicks.p  pLately what some people have been doing is copy my link and than reload that in an iframe, which is causing unnecessary load on my system.p  pWhat I was thinking is that to trick the tricksters, I would create a link where the user comes in on my website, then I would internally from my website redirect the user to another link on my website where there is an iframe breaking script i need an example of how to implement this and a redirect to the related article. This means all the people trying to DDOS my site will have to comeup with something new. What code would you suggest to prevent people from loading my widget in an iframe What code would you suggest to prevent hardcore DDOSp  pAnother issue I had was that related articles dont always receive my url as the referrer, which means that the user can exactly track the traffic from the widget.

That is, commas that come at the end of an array or object data structure, and therefore commas that come immediately before either an ] or  character.p  pThe main challenge Im encountering is how to make the regex that checks for ] or  nongreedy.  The regex needs to span multiple lines, since the comma could end one line, followed by the  or ] on the next line, but Ive figured out how to do that with the help of the book Minimal Perl.p  pAlso, Id like to be able to pipe a number of files to this Perl regex via findxargs, and so Id like to print the name of the input file, and the line number within that file.p  pBelow are various attempts of mine that are not particularly close to working straight from my bash history.

Negative 51855 pIf we have a neural network such as the multilayer perceptron back propagation neural network that uses sigmodial logistic activation functions is it possible to feed the network outputs and have it compute back a set of inputs Since we can reverse the activation function by using the natural logarithm and inverse operations until we have a sum value that is made up of all the weights multiplied by their inputs i would think that it would be possible to at least get sets of possible inputs that will generate the specified output value.p

Make a subclass of MyList from exercise 2 called MyListSub, which extends MyList to print a message to stdout before each overloaded operation is called and counts the number of calls. MyListSub should inherit basic method behavior from MyList. Adding a sequence to a MyListSub should print a message, increment the counter for  calls, and perform the superclasss method. Also, introduce a new method that prints the operation counters to stdout, and experiment with your class interactively. Do your counters count calls per instance, or per class for all instances of the class How would you program the other option Hint it depends on which object the count members are assigned to class members are shared by instances, but self members are perinstance data.p blockquote  pSo the part Im really interested in right now is the p  blockquote   pMake a subclass of MyList from exercise 2 called MyListSub, which extends MyList to print a message to stdout before each overloaded operation is called and counts the number of calls.p blockquote  pI can see a good use of DRY right here thatll kill all my birds with one stone.

Negative 51855 pI searched far and wide and information on the net seems to suggest that conditional compilation using the preprocessor works exclusively on environment variables.p  pBasically, I would like to have an inline function or macro perform different operations based in its input arguments. Example of what I want to achievep  precodeinline void fooint x       if x lt 32          register0  1 ltlt x      else          register1  1 ltlt x  32      endif   codepre  pThe main goal here is that the resulting inline code will not contain conditional code for constant inputs.p  pBasically, I currently program for a microcontroller lpc213x and would like to have an inline function or macro to do pin configuration setup. Since pin configurations are split across multiple registers e.g. 0 and 1 above, I would like to perform some conditional checks to decide which register is supposed to be written to for a given pin constant.p  pHowever, the pin configurations are all constant at compile time, so I would like to eliminate the conditional checks from compile code. I know that optimization would likely get rid of unnecessary conditionals anyway, but Im wondering whether there is a way to achieve this behavior explicitly, because I might need to disable optimization in the future.p  pThanks,p  pFRobp

Negative 51855 pI am investigating using the jQuery object as a safe dereferencer like they have in Groovy.  The issue I am trying to solve is I retrieve JSON from AJAX calls that may not have the values I am looking for.  I would like a convenience method to check whether I get a value back before attempting to do something with that value.p  pFor nonGroovy programmers, if a variable in Groovy is null, the methods calling it fail silently rather than throw null pointer exceptions.  p  pI can create an empty object out of a null variable by using the jQuery operator like sop  precodevar myvar myvar.chainedfunc codepre  pIn this example, chainedfunc will still execute on the empty object.  p  pIs there a way to prevent chainedfunc from executing if the original value was nullp  pI understand that I may have to live with performing the chained functions on an empty object.  p  pNotep  h2Im leaving the thought below for the record, but I realize the logic is wrong.  Case 1, the object is null in which case there is no type so no way to create a new object of the same type, case 2 the object exists in which case I return the object unchanged.  The overall question still makes sense though.h2  pIn that case, the concern becomes what if the original value was not an object, but an array, since I created an object out of it in order to avoid the null error.  For that situation I have the following functionp  precode.fn.safe  function     if this.get0         return this.get0          else return []  codepre  pIn this case I am assuming the original was an array.  Ideally I would like to be able to determine the type of the original and return an empty instance of the same type.p  precode this does not work because type is not a constructor .fn.safe  function     var type  typeof this.get0     return this.get0  new type  codepre

I think I need to use codeLooper.preparecode somewhere, but maybe I need another thread just to handle locations requests I cant seem to get the emulator to respond to any geo fix events, so I must be doing something wrong.p  pBelow is the service code, stripped for all the nonrelevant parts. p  precodepublic class MyService extends Service implements LocationListener      private Thread runner     private volatile boolean keepRunning     private LocationManager locationManager  null       Override     public void onCreate          keepRunning  true          runner  new Threadnull, new Runnable              public void run  workerLoop                   runner.start         startGps           Override     public void onDestroy          keepRunning  false         runner.interrupt           private void workerLoop           Looper.myLooper How does this work         Looper.prepare           Main worker loop for the service         while keepRunning              try                  if commandQueue.notEmpty                      executeJob                  else                      Thread.sleep1000                               catch Exception e                                   stopGps           public void onLocationChangedLocation location           Doing something with the position...                 public void onProviderDisabledString provider      public void onProviderEnabledString provider      public void onStatusChangedString provider, int status, Bundle extras       private void startGps          if locationManager  null             locationManager  LocationManager getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE         if locationManager  null              Criteria criteria  new Criteria             criteria.setAccuracyCriteria.ACCURACYFINE             criteria.setAltitudeRequiredfalse             criteria.setBearingRequiredtrue             criteria.setCostAllowedfalse             criteria.setSpeedRequiredtrue             String provider  locationManager.getBestProvidercriteria, true             if provider  null                 locationManager.requestLocationUpdatesprovider, 10, 5, LocationListener this                                      private void stopGps          if locationManager  null             locationManager.removeUpdatesLocationListener this         locationManager  null        codepre

Negative 51855 pI am making an Sdl game, its 2d shooter. I am using SDL to import surfaces and OpenGL to draw them on the screen doing so because it works way faster than just SDL. Ive got two threads running, one for processing stuff and rendering, and another one for input. Basically, the processing one is taking 12 of my CPU, while the input loop takes 25 on quadcore, so its 1 full core. I tried doing SDLDelay1 before each codewhile SDLPollEventampkeyeventcode and it works Reduces CPU load to 3 for whole process. However, theres a nasty side effect. The whole program input is handicapped it doesnt detect all of the key pressed, and for example, to make the character move, it sometimes takes up to 3 seconds of bashing keyboard for it to react. p  pIve also tried solving it by using codeSDLPeepEventcode and codeSDLWaitEventcode, however, its causing the same very long delay.p  pEvent loop codep  precodevoid GameWorldMovement      SDLEvent keyevent     bool x1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2, z3, m          Booleans to determine the     x1  x2  y1  y2  z1  z2  z3  m  0    movement direction     SDLEnableKeyRepeat0, 0     while 1              while SDLPollEventampkeyevent                      switchkeyevent.type                          case SDLKEYDOWN                 switchkeyevent.key.keysym.sym                                  case SDLKLEFT                     x1  1                     x2  0                     break                 case SDLKRIGHT                     x1  0                     x2  1                     break                 case SDLKUP                     y1  1                     y2  0                     break                 case SDLKDOWN                     y1  0                     y2  1                     break                 default                     break                                  break             case SDLKEYUP                 switchkeyevent.key.keysym.sym                                  case SDLKLEFT                     x1  x2  0                     break                 case SDLKRIGHT                     x1  x2  0                     break                 case SDLKUP                     y1  y2  0                     break                 case SDLKDOWN                     y1  y2  0                     break                 default                     break                                  break             case SDLQUIT                 PrintToFileThe game was closed manually.n                 CleanUp                 return                 break             default                 break                               m  x1  x2  y1  y2         if m    if any button is pushed down, calculate the movement                  direction and assign it to the player             z1  x1  x2 ampamp y1  y2             z2  x1 ampamp x2  y2             z3  y1 ampamp x1  y2 ampamp x2             MainSurvivorgtSetMovementDirection4  z1  2  z2  z3                  else     if no button is pushed down, reset the direction             MainSurvivorgtSetMovementDirection1       codepre  pCode for calculationrender loopp  precodevoid GameWorldGenerateCycles      int Iterator  0     timet start        SDLEvent event      Render     beginthreadMovementThread, 0, this     while 1                   I know I check this in input loop, but if I comment         SDLPollEventampevent    out it from here, that loop cannot         if event.type  SDLQUIT   see any of the events                       PrintToFileThe game was closed manually.n             CleanUp                                      It never closes through here though          start  clock         Iterator         if Iterator gt 232792560             Iterator  232792560         MainSurvivorgtMyTurnIterator         for unsigned int i  0 i lt Survivors.size i                      Survivors[i]gtMyTurnIterator             if Survivors[i]gtGetDiedAt  0 ampamp Survivors[i]gtGetDiedAt  25 lt clock                              delete Survivors[i]                 Survivors.eraseSurvivors.begin  5                               if Survivors.size  0             SpawnSurvivors          for int i  0 i lt intZombies.size i                      Zombies[i]gtMyTurnIterator             if Zombies[i]gtGetType  3 ampamp Zombies[i]gtGetDiedAt  25 lt Iterator                              delete Zombies[i]                 Zombies.eraseZombies.begin  i                 i                               if Zombies.size lt 3             SpawnZombies               No need to render every cycle, gameplay is slow         if Iterator  2  0             Render          if Interval  clock  start gt 0             SDLDelayInterval  clock  intstart       codepre  pDoes anyone have any ideasp

At first, we have a simply connected space in the grid with an impassable border, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZOwuE.jpg altenter image description herep  pWe then start placing impassable obstacles of various dimensions e.g. 1x1, 2x2,.. into the passable space. After each obstacle is placed, we need to test whether the remaining passable space is still connected i.e. make sure we didnt split the passable space in two or more disconnected spaces. Tiles are connected diagonally, too.p  pThe point is that after every obstacle placement, every remaining passable tile has a path that connects it to EVERY other remaining passable tile.p  pIm aware of the possibility of searching for paths between possibly disconnected points, but Im afraid that might be too inefficient. What Im interested in is doing this testing as fast as possible.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 51855 pIm trying to setup a grid where I do column sorting, but I wanted to do zebra striping, only rather than every other row or every x rows, I want it to be based on the value of the previous row. i.e. All rows that contain 0 have a blue background, the next value would have a white background, the next value would be blue, etc....p  pThe problem I have is that I cant seem to find where to actually do the setting of the background colors.

What I want to do is take some JSON that is made with php and populate a iOS table view. p  phere is my json.phpp  precodeltphp array  array1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 json  jsonencodearray echo json gt codepre  pMy only problem is, is I have no idea where to start on how to use JSONKit framework. a hrefhttpsgithub.comjohnezangJSONKit relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjohnezangJSONKita  I would prefer to use JSONKit over the other alternatives just because it seems it has more support.p  precodeNSString strURL  [NSString stringWithFormathttpapi.tekop.netjson.php] NSData dataURL  [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL[NSURL URLWithStringstrURL]] NSString strResult  [[NSString alloc] initWithDatadataURL encodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] NSLog, strResult codepre  pI was able to print the results of the JSON page in the debug console. Now my only question is what next I have tried to look for some tutorials online but all I could find was something more advanced Jason phraser. To advanced for my basic needs. I know my questions very vague and open to a lot of different answer, but I figured this is the place to ask these types of questions. p
Negative 51855 pstrongSummaryThe Problemstrongp  pAfter hovering over a link in a menu system that uses jQuery and hoverIntent to display a submenu, if the mouse pointer moves into the submenu, the submenu immediately closes.p  pstronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettaJmz27 relnofollowExample on JSfiddleastrongp  pstrongDetailsstrongp  pIve been having a problem with the jQuery hoverIntent plugin. I have a navigation menu that includes a submenu. That submenu is opened when the user hovers over a specified toplevel link. Here is the HTMLp  precodeltul idMenugt     ltligtlta hrefgtHomeltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefnewsgtNewsltagtltligt         ltli classhassublinksgtlta hrefsoftware.phpgtSoftware amp Appsltagt             ltulgt                 ltligtlta hrefwindows.phpgtWindowsltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefmac.phpgtMacltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefios.phpgtiOSltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefandroid.phpgtAndroidltagtltligt             ltulgt         ltligt     ltligtlta hreffeedback.phpgtFeedbackltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefabout.phpgtAboutltagtltligt ltulgt codepre  pBasically, each codeltligtcode within the codeltulgtcode with id Menu has a link to a page on the website, and one of the codeltligtscode contains a submenu another codeltulgtcode with more links. That codeltligtcode with the submenu in it is given the class hassublinks, and still has an codeltagtcode tag in it to link to the main Software amp Apps page. But because it contains a submenu, I also used jQuery and hoverIntent to make it so that when you hover over the Software amp Apps codeltligtcode, the submenu codeltulgtcode is displayed. Here is the codep  precodefunction       function showMenu          Menu ul.slideDown500, swing          function hideMenu          Menu ul.slideUp500, swing            Menu gt li.hassublinks gt a.hoverIntent         over showMenu,         timeout 400,         out hideMenu       codepre  pThis code simply makes it so that when the codeltagtcode tag in a toplevel codeltligtcode that has sublinks is hovered over, the submenu will be displayed, and then disappear when the mouse pointer leaves. This works, however strongthere is one major issuestrong After the initial codeltligtcode is hovered over to display the submenu, if the mouse pointer moves onto that submenu or an codeltligtcode in the submenu, the submenu is hidden. Obviously, this is not supposed to happen. I have created a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettaJmz27 relnofollowdemoa of this on jsfiddle. Is there any way to fix this I had previously been using CSS3 transitions for the submenu, but switched to jQuery when I realized that you cannot easily transition the height of an element from 0px its closed height to the value auto its open height. Now with jQuery I can easily transition the submenu to its full height, so thats no longer a problem, but now theres this issue, and I cant figure out how to fix it. Is there any way to make the submenu stay open when its hovered overp  pI have searched for similar questions and did find a few, but after reading them I saw that they involved codeltdivsgtcode and not codeltulgtscode, codeltligtscode, and codeltagtscode, and when I tested the answers to those questions by changing them to use those tags, they didnt work correctly.p

So there is a conflict there.p  pThis is because of the routing problem. Appreciate any kind of help.p  pThanks in advance.p  pActually I found out the problem is with the conflict of two actions in the same controller. If I use these two actions separately they work fine. I do not know how to handle when we have two actions in the same controller like above. I looked in to custom parameter binding, but I do not think that is the problem since my actions work fine separately.p  pThanks.p

Negative 51855 pI have a certain situation here, and wanted to see the best outcome of the approach using design patterns and OOPS concept.p  pI have a webservice call which if called with different parameter lets say bed, car, and toy. For right now lets keep these parameters as const and they never change when making calls.p  pHence, based on those three parameters, it can be only one selected, and passed through the webservice call. p  pThe webservice call, initially have been constructed as a Class method. As, the whole idea was simply to get the value, make a nsurlRequest, get the data, parse and return it back in NSDictionary form.p  pNow, the business requirement have got changed, and car, and bed requires additional webservice calls, based on what accessories they require, and chosen if the customer needs it or not, proceeds the first webservice call.p  pThus, if you notice this is somewhat of a waterfall methodology, as the second service call is required to complete prior the first one in order to proceed. p  pBased on the above scenario, what could be a better approach to handle such situationp  pI have thought about using Class delegates, without changing much of the construction of the class, but just wanted to get much clear understanding if there can be any better approach.p  pI cant use GCD here, as this is being used for iOS 3.0 as well. p  pI am using NSRunloop mechanism for now with 10 seconds delay, but feels like its not a good approach.p  pThanks.p

Negative 51855 pI have an app that may save some files. When the user closes the app, I would like to ask for saving strongifstrong the user did not already save the file as it is currenty.br If I am not clear enough, I somehow want to check if the file has been modified from the last saving.br I have considered making a codeBooleancode variable that turns to codetruecode if the file is saved and then turns back to codefalsecode every time the file is modified in any way writing or deleting elements in the file.br My question is if there is any easier solution to do that. It seems to me a lot of useless work to set the variable to codetruecode every time the file changes work both for me and the machine, and I would not want this, since I have a quite wide and complex app, and changes in file are likely to happen quite often.  p  pEdit after the answers Thank you all, it was really helpful. Eventually I realised that I needed a function that was needed in most of the changes I made to the file, so I didnt need to work so much. The other changes were not so many so I just made the changes to the codeBooleancode.br Thanks againp

Negative 51855 pHow do you your company manage the configfiles of the appssystems you build Let me tell you how we do it, and what the problem is.p  pIm working at a company where we develop software with about 15 developers. We build lineofbusiness web apps that are deployed at our managed hosting provider. One of our main apps consists of one web site and about ten WCF services. Some of the services are connected to each other.p  pI dont know if this is a big system, or small, but my opinion is that is takes us way too long to get things up and running in our different environments test, acceptance and production.p  pWe have configfiles per environment in our Visual Studio projects. So a codeweb.test.configcode, a codeweb.acc.configcode, a codeweb.prod.configcode and a codeweb.configcode for development. They all have the same keys in them, but the values can be different, depending on the environment they are meant for.p  pIf I do a quick count of the appsettings in the web.config for the webapp I count 32. And I count 5 endpoints. We have four environments dev, test, acc and prod this means 128 appsettings and 20 endpoints in total for one web app. We can easily make mistakes, especially when deadlines are closing in. We are all people so things like this happen to everyone we make a change in a configfile, but forget to check in before we build and deploy. Or we make a change on the webserver and forget to change it also in the four web.configs. Or we Change only three of four config files. And so on. And then we have the infrastructure at our managed hosting provider. By default every port is closed. So if one WCF service needs to talk to another WCF service on a different server, a port has to be opened in a firewall. We do this in Test, but in Acceptance we have to do it again, and we have forgotten which ports have to be opened, so its more like trialanderror oh my service cant connect to the database, probably the port is closed. And the same stuff happens in production again. Our managed hosting provider can take a few days to open a port in a firewall, according to the SLA. So, thuis quickly becomes a pretty long process. And in the end it takes us about two months to have Test, Acceptance and production up and running.p  pSo, my question is how do you manage the configurations and the infrastructure and the process around itp

Negative 51855 pIm working my brain off trying to figure out a strange behavior of the UltraGrid Bands mechanism. The below code contains everything you need to recreate the problem.p  pIm creating a DataSet and filling it with two DataTables. Then I assign the DataSet as a DataSource of BindingSource object. That BindingSource object is set as an UltraGrid.DataSource.p  pThe below code will be helpful to fully understand whats going on after a single PrepareData method is launched. The grid displays 3 records with the first one expandable to show the second Band referenced to it by DataRelation. You can check that by commenting out the second call.p  precode    public partial class Form1  Form      BindingSource bs  new BindingSource     DataSet ds  new DataSet      public Form1          InitializeComponent         DoLayout         Bind         PrepareData         PrepareData           private void DoLayout          ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Override.ExpansionIndicator  Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.ShowExpansionIndicator.CheckOnDisplay           private void Bind          bs.DataSource  ds         ultraGrid1.DataSource  bs           private void PrepareData           you need to keep watching the ultraGrid1.DisplayLayout.Bands.All property          all the time  normally it contains one entry,          the default NewDataSet entry         bs.SuspendBinding         ds.Relations.Clear         ds.Clear         ds.Tables.Clear          when the above code will run for the second time, you can see that          Bands.All property will claim to have the standard NewDataSet entry          again. Seems like everything is working well          DataTable dt  new DataTableTABLE1         dt.Columns.Addcol1         dt.Columns.Addcol2         dt.Columns.Addcol3          dt.Rows.Add1, 1, 1         dt.Rows.Add2, 2, 2         dt.Rows.Add3, 3, 3           after adding the datatable to the dataset, we can see that there was          a change made to the DisplayLayout.Band.All list of the ultraGrid1          NewDataSet will change to TABLE1                   now watch the behavior when the method is run for the second time         ds.Tables.Adddt          after the second run, you can see the first problem in the Bands.All entries          dt  new DataTableTABLE2         dt.Columns.Addscol1         dt.Columns.Addscol2          dt.Rows.Adds1, 1         dt.Rows.Adds2, 1         dt.Rows.Adds3, 1           the Bands.All property still will say there is only one element in it          but not anymore once the code is executed for the second time         ds.Tables.Adddt  for the second code run  here is the second problem          now the first time we add that relation, you can see that          a new entry exists in the Bands.All property of the ultraGrid1 T1T2         dt.ParentRelations.AddT1T2, ds.Tables[TABLE1].Columns[col1], dt.Columns[scol2], false          after the second run of the code, here you can see the third problem          bs.ResumeBinding        codepre  pNow if you run the PrepareData method once more, the grid gets messy. I actually found whats causing the problem, thus the heavy comments in the code above, but I cant figure out why is this happening. As a result I simply want the grid to behave exactly the same no matter how many times the method is called.p  pDoes anyone have a clue what could be the reason for thisp  pI already tried to null the DataSources, and reassigning them tired changing the order of the methods called even tried to invoke nonpublic methods of the BandsCollection object like ClearAllButBandZero and Clear, but it was all to no avail.p  pIve found an artible in the KnowledgeBase of the Infragistics DevCenter a hrefhttpdevcenter.infragistics.comSupportKnowledgeBaseArticle.AspxArticleID1751 relnofollowhttpdevcenter.infragistics.comSupportKnowledgeBaseArticle.AspxArticleID1751a but that didnt help in my case. Each time the DataSet is reconstructed, the UltraGrid.DisplayLayout.Bands collection is getting more and more messy.p

Negative 51855 pI have a Django application hosted on Heroku using the PostgreSQL database addon. Upon performing a GET request for the front page, my applications performs a SQL query to extract some necessary display information. I also create a subprocess with Popen on each GET request.p  pHowever, when I notice that the number of GET requests increasing to around once every second, I being erroring at the statement codemodel.objects.getidcode. I get an OperationalError  Im assuming that either my free plan on heroku isnt keeping up or my database isnt keeping up.p  pIn this case, I dont want to leave Herokus free plan, but I was wondering if I did, would I need to create more workers Upgrade my database What are ways to diagnose the issue And why would a simple SQL query cause issues as the number of requests increase to an interval of around once every second Does this seem reasonablep  pMy hack solution was just to sleep the view whenever I catch an OperationalError. Any other approaches recommendedp

The goal is for the next box top appear on top and to fade in when the next button is pressed. The box is positioned on top by appending it to the container, so that it is added as the last element and thus visible on top, and should fade in through css transition.p  pThe problem is that the css transition does not seem to work after the box was appended. The css transition works well if tested on a box element that is not appended.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netz435s13 relnofollowFiddle herea, code belowp  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classbox redgtltdivgt     ltdiv classbox bluegtltdivgt     ltdiv classbox greengtltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv idnextgtNextltdivgt codepre  pJSp  precodevar container  .container   Save the current list order var list  container.children.box  The current index var current  0   Put the first on top container.appendlist[0]  function next       Figure out what is the index of the next box     if current  1 lt list.length current     else current  0       Save it in a variable     var target  list[current]       Put it on top     container.appendtarget       Hide it and then fade it in     target.cssopacity, 0.csstransition, opacity 1000ms easeout.cssopacity, 1       The fading in is not working   next.clicknext codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pA basic solution to this problem was to call offset on the target after setting the opacity to 0 and before setting the transition cssp  precodetarget.cssopacity, 0 target.offset target.csstransition, opacity 1000ms easeout.cssopacity, 1 codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netz435s14 relnofollowstrongUpdatedstrong version of the above fiddle hereap

Negative 51855 pRecently I was thinking about some issues I had in the past while attempting to design a particular domain model, lets just say Address, that can be editable with a given context but noneditable within another. My current way of thinking is that I would have both a Value Object version of the Address and an Entity for the Address perhaps attached to something like a customer account in order to derive its identity. p  pNow Im realizing that if Im ever creating a new Address, such as when one is entered in by the user, that I most likely also need to be able to continue to edit that Address and perhaps edit any preexisting Addresses as well within that same bounded context. For this reason I could assume that within this context Address should be modeled as Entity and not a Value Object. This leads me to my main question which is that if you should always be using entities when modifying an existing set of data or creating a new data then does it ever make sense to have a Factory for creating any Value Objectp  pThe rule that is beginning to emerge for me as I follow this line of thinking is that value objects should only be created to represent things that are either static to the application or things that have already been persisted into the database but not things that are transient within the current domain context. So the only place I should any type of creation of value objects would be when they are rehydratedmaterialized within or on the behalf of aggregate root repositories for persistent values or within a service in the case of static values. This is beginning to seem pretty clear to me however it concerns me that I havent read anywhere else where somebody is drawing the same conclusions. Either way, Im hoping that somebody can confirm my conclusions or set me straight.p

Also, the Dog ids are stored in the query cache.  li liThe second time the query is called the Dog ids are in the query cache and the Dog objects are in the L2 cache, everything works fine. The query cache returns the ids and the Dogs are fetched from L2.li liWhen the query cache expires but the L2 cache is still valid, the query reruns and caches the Dog ids.li liNow the L2 cache expires for the Dog object and all objects are evicted from cache. The query cache still has the ids cached, so hibernate fetches the Dog objects strongone by onestrong, which takes forever.li ol  pThe 3rd point is bugging me. The query cache got invalidated and reran on the database, fetching the Dog objects, but the Dog objects were not updated in the L2 cache.

Here is a simple example to show you my case.p  precodepublic class PersonEfModel      public int Id  get set      public string Vorname  get set      public string Nachname  get set    public class EfContext  DbContext      public DbSetltPersongt Personen  get set   codepre  pto be independent from the implementation of the data access i wrote a abstraction layer with repositories.p  precodepublic class Person      public int Id  get set      public string Vorname  get set      public string Nachname  get set    public interface IGenericRepositoryltTgt      int Count  get       void AddT item     void DeleteT item     void UpdateT item      T GetDataint id     IEnumerableltTgt GetData     IEnumerableltTgt GetDataint offset, int count      IEnumerableltTgt FindExpressionltFuncltT,boolgtgt predicate     IEnumerableltTgt FindIEnumerableltExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgtgt predicates  codepre  pcodePersoncode and codePersonEfModelcode has to be two different types in order to be completely independent from the database models. So there would be a generic Repository of type Person but i dont really know how to implement the Find methods. I can only execute Expressions against the database that depends on the PersonEfModel and not on Person. p  pSo is there a way to translate a codeExpressionltFuncltPerson, boolgtgtcode into a codeExpressionltFuncltPersonEfModel, boolgtgtcode to execute it against the database or am i on the wrong pathp
Negative 51855 pI am working on Soil Spectral Classification using neural networks and I have data from my Professor obtained from his lab which consists of spectral reflectance from wavelength 1200 nm to 2400 nm. He only has 270 samples.p  pI have been unable to train the network for accuracy more than 74 since the training data is very less only 270 samples. I was concerned that my Matlab code is not correct, but when I used the Neural Net Toolbox in Matlab, I got the same results...nothing more than 75 accuracy.p  pWhen I talked to my Professor about it, he said that he does not have any more data, but asked me to do random perturbation on this data to obtain more data. I have research online about random perturbation of data, but have come up short.p  pCan someone point me in the right direction for performing random perturbation on 270 samples of data so that I can get more data p  pAlso, since by doing this, I will be constructing fake data, I dont see how the neural network would be any better cos isnt the point of neural nets using actual real valid data to train the networkp  pThanks,p  pFaisal.p

Negative 51855 pVimvi shortcuts are awesome, but there is one behavior that I would be very happy if it could be configured.

Negative 51855 pHello Everyone Im having trouble with a simple flash game. So far it is trouble removing projectiles once they have hit an object.  p  pAfter going through the site found out to add .parent.removeChildwtv to remove the objects.  When used the object that is fired by my player hits an object, both are removed but when another is fired at the same position the fired object hits an invisible object that was just removed and is then removed at that position instead of carrying on until the end of the stage or another object is hit.  This seems to only happen when the fired object is removed.p  pThis is the code, the problem i believe is in the moveLaser Function, if anymore information is needed please let me know, any recommendations would be great, thank you.p  precodepackage  import flash.display.MovieClip import flash.events.Event import flash.events.KeyboardEvent import flash.ui.Keyboard import flash.display3D.IndexBuffer3D   public class Level1 extends MovieClip     private var playerSpaceShip     private var objectsArray     private var probMoveObjint     private var bgStarsLevel1stars      public function Level1         addEventListenerEvent.ADDEDTOSTAGE, onAddedToStage           public function onAddedToStageeventEventvoid         removeEventListenerEvent.ADDEDTOSTAGE, onAddedToStage          probMoveObj  1          bgStars  new Level1stars         player  new SpaceShip         objects  new Array50          bgStars.vx  50         addChildbgStars          forvar iint  0 i lt objects.length i             objects[i]  new GameObject             addGameObjectsobjects[i]                   player.x  100         player.y  stage.stageHeight  250         addChildplayer          bgStars.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveBackground         player.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, movePlayer         stage.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYDOWN, checkKey         stage.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYDOWN, checkFire            public function movePlayereventEventvoid          forvar iint  0 i lt objects.length i             ifobjects[i].hitTestObjectplayer.hit                 objects[i].removeEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveObject                 traceHIT                                 public function checkFireeventKeyboardEventvoid         ifevent.keyCode  Keyboard.SPACE             traceSPACE             var laserShiplaser  new Shiplaser             var laser2Shiplaser  new Shiplaser             laser.x   player.x  30             laser2.x  player.x  30             laser.y  player.y  30             laser2.y  player.y  30             laser.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveLaser             laser2.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveLaser             addChildlaser             addChildlaser2                    public function checkKeyeventKeyboardEventvoid          ifevent.keyCode  Keyboard.UP             ifplayer.y  player.height  2 gt 0                 player.y  10                 traceUP                               else ifevent.keyCode  Keyboard.DOWN             ifplayer.y player.height  2 lt stage.stageHeight                 player.y  10                 tracedown                               else ifevent.keyCode  Keyboard.LEFT             ifplayer.x  player.width  2 gt 0                 player.x  10                 traceLEFT                               else ifevent.keyCode  Keyboard.RIGHT             ifplayer.x  player.width  2 lt stage.stageWidth                 player.x  10                 traceRIGHT                                 public function addGameObjectsgameObjGameObjectvoid          position the object randomly, but to the right of the player             gameObj.x  stage.stageWidth  Math.ceilMath.random  4000  gameObj.width2             gameObj.y  Math.ceilMath.random  stage.stageHeight  100  gameObj.height2              add object to the stage             addChildgameObj              set the velocity of the object             gameObj.vx  Math.ceilMath.random  1  2              move the object each frame             gameObj.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveObject           private function moveObjecteventEventvoid              var gameObjGameObject  event.target as GameObject         gameObj.x  gameObj.vx           private function moveBackgroundeventEventvoid          ifbgStars.x lt bgStars.width  2  100  1             bgStars.x  0                     else             bgStars.x  bgStars.vx                    private function moveLasereventEventvoid          var laserShiplaser  event.target as Shiplaser          forvar iint  0 i lt objects.length i             ifobjects[i].hitTestObjectlaser.hit                 objects[i].removeEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveObject                 ifobjects[i].parent                     objects[i].parent.removeChildobjects[i]                                   removeEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveLaser                 iflaser.parent                     laser.parent.removeChildlaser                                                  iflaser.x gt stage.stageWidth             traceLASER REMOVED              removeEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveLaser             iflaser.parent                 laser.parent.removeChildlaser                               else             laser.x  20                codepre  pp

Negative 51855 pIm presented with the following challenge questionp  blockquote   pThere are a circle of 100 baskets in a room the baskets are numbered   in sequence from 1 to 100 and each basket contains one apple.    Eventually, the apple in basket 1 will be removed but the apple in   basket 2 will be skipped.  Then the apple in basket 3 will be removed.   This will continue moving around the circle, removing an apple from a   basket, skipping the next until only one apple in a basket remains.   Write some code to determine in which basket the remaining apple is   in.p blockquote  pI concluded that basket 100 will contain the last apple and heres my codep  precode     var allApples  []         var apples  []         var j  0         var max  100          var o              while j lt max                  o  j                 allApples.pushj                           var apples  allApples.filterfunctionval                  return 0  val  2                          while apples.length gt 1                  for i  0 i lt apples.length i  2                      apples.splicei, 1                                            console.logapples codepre  pMy question is did I do this correctly  What concerns me is the description of a circle of baskets.  Im not sure this is relevant at all to how I code my solution.  And would the basket in which the remaining apple reside be one that would otherwise be skippedp  pI hope someone can let me know if I answered this correctly, answered it partially correct or my answer is entirely wrong.

Negative 51855 pThis is a short term solution to a long term problem...p  pI have a database created by someone else isnt that always the case.  One particular table stores historical transactional data.  When this table becomes large, the site performs like crap.  When I can get to it, I will redesign database 3nf.  Until then, I need to limit the table to around 500,000 rows.  So I want to periodically run a script to move the oldest rows to an archive table that will probably never be used.  Lets say I am moving 510K rows at a time, what is the most efficient way to do itp  pThis is a MYSQL database.p  pOff the top of my head, I figure I will get a count of the number of rows.  Find out what the count  500000 LIMIT 1 id is and move everything with and ID lt to that.p  pDo I just select, insert and delete or is there a better way to do itp

Negative 51855 pI am attempting to create a C application to host automated word games in an ancient social MMO called VZones. Many similar existing applications use a DLL file called wadapi.dll, whose code is unavailable, which encapsulates the DDE functionality that allows communication with the VZones host. The code below which is the full code of the skeleton application  I have included it all because of the disparate parts of the DLL and callback handling, and because I will ultimately make the full code available as an opensource project anyway simply uses a timer, whose TimerGrabTextTick event calls the DLLs DapiGetAllText procedure. The DLL then passes all of the conversation text in the client window back to my app via a callback, which is received by my ProcessGetAllText function. It works fine for the first few minutes, while a single thread is running but as soon as a secondary thread is spawned, it crashes with a NullReferenceException error on the DapiGetAllTextvzWordyHoster line.p  pThis is my first experiment in C, so I am still finding my feet, and I apologise for any messiness in the code. Though I have dabbled in several other programming languages as an enthusiast, not as a professional programmer, this is also the first time that I have had to worry about threading, because it is the first time that it has caused me any problems. My Googling and reading around the subject has led me to believe that I should be able to avoid this exception by using mutexes or locks, but after several frustrating hours Im still getting the same exception. Ive now stripped all of the mutexetc code back out.

Negative 51855 pI would have believed that this question has an obvious answer, but I cannot seem to find any. I have an ASP.Net MasterPage which has a content page in which there are several dynamically created input controls. When I post the form which contains them, I want to retrieve their values. That is only possible using the name attribute of the control and calling Request.Form[name].p  pSince the input controls are part of a ContentPlaceHolder, their name attribute is assigned the UniqueId of the control, which is a string that could look like this for example ctl00sktsbodydivMyNameId.p  pThe above name in the example is not a randomly generated name, but it depends on the structure of the controls parents, hence it is not that easy in a postback to generate the name ctl00sktsbodydivMyNameId, so that I can call Request.Form[ctl00sktsbodydivMyNameId].p  pWhat is the best practice way of retrieving the posted datap  pThe platform is .Net 4.0p  pThanks Jihadp

And If in this one minute I continue pressing the reload button the connections stay at the dead server and their TCP timeout counter gets restarted.p  pSo my question is Is there a way to tell the load balancer in NAT mode to terminate  redirect existing connections to a dead server emimmediatelyem or close to immediately p  pIt seems to me a blunder that a reload on the clientside can make a connection become a zombie, e.g. be bound to a dead real server although persistance is not used and the other server is ready and available.p  pThe only thing that I found affecting this timeout is changing the keepAliveTimeout in the Windows machine running the IE8 which I use for the tests. When I cahnged it from the dafault value of 60 seconds to 30 seconds the connections could be transferred after 30 seconds. It seems to me very odd that a client setting can affect the operation of a network component as the load balancer.p  pAnd another thing  what is the colum named Inactive Conenctions in the output from ipvsadm used for Which connections are considered inactivep  pAnd also in the output of ipvsadm i see a couple of connections with the state TIMEWAIT. What are these forp  pAny insight and suggestions are highly appreciated p  pCheers, Konstantinp  pP.S Here is some more information about the configurationp  precode uname a Linux 3.0.580.6.2default 1 SMP Fri Jan 25 083101 UTC 2013 x8664 x8664 x8664 GNULinux   ipvsadm L IP Virtual Server version 1.2.1 size4096 Prot LocalAddressPort Scheduler Flags   gt RemoteAddressPort           Forward Weight ActiveConn InActConn TCP  lbmysite.com wrr   gt spwfe001.mysite.comh Masq    10     0          0   gt spwfe002.mysite.comh Masq    10     0          0   iptables t nat L Chain PREROUTING policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination  Chain INPUT policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination  Chain OUTPUT policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination  Chain POSTROUTING policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination SNAT       all    anywhere             anywhere            to172.22.9.100 SNAT       all    anywhere             anywhere            to172.22.1.130    ip a 1 lo ltLOOPBACK,UP,LOWERUPgt mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN     linkloopback 000000000000 brd 000000000000     inet 127.0.0.18 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host lo     inet 127.0.0.28 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host secondary lo 2 eth0 ltBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWERUPgt mtu 1500 qdisc pfifofast state UNKNOWN         qlen 1000     linkether 005056a577ae brd ffffffffffff     inet 192.168.8.21622 brd 192.168.11.255 scope global eth0 3 eth1 ltBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWERUPgt mtu 1500 qdisc pfifofast state UNKNOWN         qlen 1000 linkether 005056a577af brd ffffffffffff inet 172.22.9.10022 brd 172.22.11.255 scope global eth11 inet 172.22.8.21322 brd 172.22.11.255 scope global secondary eth1 4 eth2 ltBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWERUPgt mtu 1500 qdisc pfifofast state UNKNOWN qlen 1000     linkether 005056a577b0 brd ffffffffffff     inet 172.22.1.13024 brd 172.22.1.255 scope global eth2    cat procsysnetipv4ipforward 1  cat procsysnetipv4vsconntrack 1  cat procsysnetipv4vsexpirenodestconn 1  cat procsysnetipv4vsexpirequiescenttemplate 1 codepre

Negative 51855 pI use Eclipse Juno and Ive made 2 projects  p  ul liOne of them is actually a EAR containing an EJB project and a project to hold only the interfaces for the EJBs.

Then the project is deployed and the EJBs are initialized.  li liThe second project is a simple WAR project depending on the project holding the interfaces. In it I have a dummy servlet calling the EJBs. The procedure of deploying is almost the same. The difference is that I choose codeWEB gt WAR filecode in the codeexportcode navigation menu. After the WAR is deployed everything works fine.  li ul  pNow the reason I do the whole Export thing is because the codeRun as gt Run on servercode does not build and deploy my projects.

Negative 51855 pHi Im a Drupal newbie and am really struggling with best practices for this CMS. Right now I am trying to use the Panels 3 Module to create the pages of my website with custom layouts that I have created. What I cant seem to wrap my head around is the ridiculous amount of excessive markup thats coming from panels as well as each individual template in the drupal install node.tpl, field functions, region.tpl etc etc. I have some very elaborate website designs that I need to create and the html that is being generated from the Drupal templates and field functions is literally making my job impossible. I am used to wordpress where I can simply make a database query examplewpquery, grab the values that I need and display them in any markup that I want. What am I missing here in Drupal Am I really supposed to overwrite 7 template files all the way down to the field level in Drupal to get some clean markup What am I missing herep

I cant really see what I am doing wrong. Can I not subscribe to a publish function which returns only one objectp  pAnyone has any ideas on this p  pbest regards Patrickp

Negative 51855 pI have a WebApi application and i am working on some POSTPUT methods and i am trying to figure out the optimal way of updating a record in the database using entity framework.p  pThe main issue with using WebApi is the request will only have a subset of the full properties of the full object.p  pFor instance, i have a codeSitecode object that has a codeProjectcode navigation object that points to the related project.  As currently sites cannot move projects, i dont supply the projectId with the PUT command meaning that codeProjectcode object of codeSitecode is empty, which causes issues when trying to update even when stating that that property is not modified, so i have been forced to reading the record first and then merging the changes and then persisting, likep  pstrongClarity for the example below, site is the object passed as a parameter to the PUT route so in this case is the partial Site objectstrongp  precodeGrab the existing site var dbSite  from s in repo                        where s.Id  id                        select s.FirstOrDefault  Update unchanged values site.Id  id site.CreatedOn  dbSite.CreatedOn  var entry  uow.EntrydbSite entry.Propertye gt e.Code.IsModified  true entry.Propertye gt e.Active.IsModified  true entry.Propertye gt e.CreatedOn.IsModified  false  uow.EntrydbSite.CurrentValues.SetValuessite  Commit uow.Commit codepre  pIs there a way with taking a partial object without certain navigation properties set and updating the database without loading it first, or is the best approach loading it and updating the way i am doing it currentlyp

Should I create business objects in a separate business layer on top of EF Meaning I would have Order generated by EF, OrderBO the business object and OrderViewModel the order to be displayed. I would have to do more mapping, since Id add another layer, but it would make the presenter lighter.p  pThanks in advancep

Finally when the post modal is closed the URL should change back to the index URLp  pSo far my routes are something like thisp  precodeApp.Router.reopen    location history   rootURL   App.Router.map gt   resource posts, gt     route show, path postid  App.PostsShowRoute  Ember.Route.extend   model params gt     App.Post.findparams.postid codepre  pThis is my modal view using Zurb Foundation reveal modalp  precodeApp.PostsShowView  Ember.View.extend   templateName postModal   classNames [revealmodal]    didInsertElement gt     .foundationreveal, open codepre  pIm rendering into an outlet into my index template, but with the current set it navigates away from my index template and renders the modal only. Once again Id like to have the modal render within the index page with its own URL, and upon being closed go back to the index URL.p

Negative 51855 pI am having problems with my grid column widths in nggrid.  My issue is that I dont know ahead of time what the columns will be they are retrieved from a service call at the same time as the values.  My Json object has two properties in it.  An array of strings for column names and then a 2d array for values.  currently the columns do not size to fit the column headers.  I understand the columns will resize to fit the row data but what if no results are returned.  then you have a mess.  I tried making it so I did not have to set grid options until I had my data but then get an undefined error.  I saw another post where the solution for that was to use ngif in the div tag so the grid does not load until you want it to.  that did not work either as the grid still tried to load before the if statement was satisfied.  Below is my code.  any thoughts  also,my ngif was like this ngifcontentAvailable.  Also adding a screen shot.

Negative 51855 pI have a tycho project that includes xtend sources. One of my dependencies comes with an older version of JUnit that does not include all features that i need. I also have a dependency on JUnit 4.11. Tycho build is fine, but the xtend compiler xtendmavenplugin seems to see the old JUnit version instead of the new one. How can i fix thisp  pstrong[EDIT]strongp  pTo clarify, this is how my dependencies look likep  precodeProject A Project B    JUnit 4.8.2 JUnit 4.11 codepre  pIn the OSGi world of tycho, this is no problem. However, the xtend compiler resolves classes in Project A with JUnit 4.8.2 classes. I know this because the offending class is the annotation Parameters, which gained the attribute name in 4.11. And this is exactly the offending part which keeps the xtend maven plugin from properly compiling. The Eclipse xtend tools seem to have no problems.p

Negative 51855 pI am trying to match a list of lastnames to a list of full names using Python 2.7 and the Levenshtein function.

Negative 51855 pAfter much reading and experimenting, I still cannot get a simple TextView to resize fully in the horizontal direction using Xcode 5.0.2 in Mavericks.  It resizes partially as the window is resized, then stops with long lines wrapped around even though my containing NSScrollView continues to resize as expected it has four default constraints and no horizontal scroller.p  pCan anyone point me to a emsimpleem codeIBAutoLayout example, preferably just a window containing just an NSTextView dragged in from the IB template library  one that works  The Apple TextEdit sample code is almost irrelevant for this purpose although it does resize horizontally quite well.  Also, there is the clip view for which I can find little information.p  pAny other tips appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 51855 pOur large IOS app has a bunch of Segmented controls. The new IOS 7 BampW look  looks like crap in our app. I can change the background color and set the corner radius so we have colored buttons again  BUT it then looks like crap when run on an IOS 6 phone. For IOS 6 I have to change the Tint color and NOT change the background color.p  pAdding conditional code to do this for each individual control would be a royal pain.  Creating a subclass to do this  and modifying all the XIBs to use it  would also be a pain.p  pIs there any way to modify the look of a control for the entire app  Can a class extension do thisp

The answer by Daniel Alder suggesting the use of GLOBALROOT seems to be relevant, as the answer uses FileChannel in the answer, but I cant seem to find the drive using this pattern. Is there a way to list all devices under GLOBALROOT or something like thatp  pAt the moment I am looking at replacing uses of NIO with straight codeInputStreamcodes, but I want to avoid this if I can. Firstly, NIO was used for a reason, and secondly, it runs through a lot of code and will require a lot of work. Finally, Id like to know how to implement something like Daniels solution so that I can write to devices or use NIO in the future.p  pSo in summary how can I access drives directly with Java NIO not codeInputStreamcodes, andor is there a way to list all devices accessible through GLOBALROOT so that I might use Daniel Alsers solutionp  pstrongSummary of Answersstrong I have kept the past edits below to avoid confusion. With the help of EJP and Apangin I emthinkem I have a workable solution. Something likep  precodeprivate void rafMethodlong posn      ByteBuffer buffer  ByteBuffer.allocate512     buffer.rewind     try RandomAccessFile raf  new RandomAccessFiledisk.getPath, r             SeekableByteChannel sbc  raf.getChannel          sbc.readbuffer      catch Exception ex          System.out.printlnOh bother   ex         ex.printStackTrace           return buffer  codepre  pThis will work as long as the posn parameter is a multiple of the sector size set at 512 in this case. Note that this also works with the Channels.newChannelFileInputStream, which seems to always return a SeekableByteStream in this case and it emappearsem it is safe to cast it to one.p  pFrom quick and dirty testing it emappearsem that these methods truly do seek and dont just skip. I searched for a thousand locations at the start of my drive and it read them. I did the same but added an offset of half of the disk size to search the back of the disk. I foundp  ul liBoth methods took almost the same time.li liSearching the start or the end of the disk did emnotem affect time.li liReducing the range of the addresses emdidem reduce time.li liSorting the addresses emdidem reduce time, but not by much.li ul  pThis suggests to me that this is truly seeking and not merely reading and skipping as a stream tends to. The speed is still terrible at this stage and it makes my hard drive sound like a washing machine, but the code was designed for a quick test and has yet to be made pretty. It may still work fine.p  pThanks to both EJP and Apangin for the help.

Negative 51855 pI have a C winform application that has 4 distinct user controls on the screen.  Each of these user controls contains a datagridview control.  When the user updates a cell value in any one of these 4 control I raise a custom event sending the value of the cell to a 5th form on the screen.  p  pThis 5th form is very similar to an Excel spreadsheet.  The 5th form must show the new value sent on its panewindow.  The issue is not in sending the data from any of the 4 user controls, that works and is reflected on the 5th form.  p  pHowever, when the event to send data is raised it stops the user input for a few seconds.  I think the 5th form is busy updating the cells.  So my question is if I implement a message queue or something similar wcf for sending the new values to the spreadsheet like control, will that 5th control pickup the data maybe on Application Idle event and not slow down the end user input on any of the 4 main controls or will I just see the same issue because of the forms all running in the same UI thread.  I did do a some testing to see if its any quicker if the 5th control is hidden from view, but I see the same results.  Also I did some timing checks and it is definitely after I raise the ValueChanged event that the system is becomes very slow. p  pAny ideas on how to approach and solve this issuep

Negative 51855 pI have a question about something Ive done in the past, but never really thought if it was the most efficient method to use.p  pLets say I have a text file, where each line contains something important and lets then say I have multiple sets of these lines, each corresponding to a unique environment...so for examplep  precode1 String that I need to parse for specific tokens.. 2 String that I need to parse for specific tokens..

Negative 51855 pIm using the Haskell FFI with a C library that defines a number of codestructcode types containing members which are pointers to codedoublecodes, intended to be treated as arrays of codedoublecodesp  precodetypedef struct Foo    int length   double values  FooT codepre  pIn my Haskell bindings to this library I have an equivalent data type in which Im trying to use codeData.Vector.Storable.Vector Doublecode for the arrayp  precodedata Foo  Foo    length  Int,   values  Data.Vector.Storable.Vector Double  deriving Show, Eq codepre  pIn order to marshall data between the C library and my Haskell code, of course, I have to write codeStorablecode instances for these types. Im trying to work out a way of using codeData.Vector.Storable.unsafeFromForeignPtrcode to create Haskell codeVectorcodes from the codedoublecode arrays that the C library has allocated and populated on the heap. Im hoping that by doing this I can avoid copying the contents of the codedoublecode arrays and just have the codeVectorcode as a kind of wrapper over the array. Side question would be given that the codedoublecode arrays can be up to 10,000s of codedoublecodes, is it worth pursuing this noncopyingp  pThis is what I have so far. Im using codehsc2hscode macros to help generate the codeStorable peekcode implementationp  precodeinstance Storable Foo where   alignment   alignment undefined  CDouble   sizeOf   size FooT    peek ptr  do     len lt peek FooT, length ptr     valuesField lt peek FooT, values ptr  IO ForeignPtr Double     let values  DV.unsafeFromForeignPtr0 valuesField len      return Foo  length  len, values  values     poke ptr Foo len values  do     poke FooT, length ptr len     DV.unsafeWith values ptrValues gt poke FooT, values ptr ptrValues codepre  pSo in my codepeekcode Im trying to codepeekcode the codevaluescode member as a codeForeignPtr Doublecode which I could then use with codeunsafeFromForeignPtrcode. However, codepeekcode generates code like thisp  precodevaluesField lt  hscptr gt peekByteOff hscptr 16 ptr  IO ForeignPtr Double codepre  pand gets stuck because theres no codeStorablecode instance for codeForeignPtr Doublecode. I think if I tried to implement an instance for codeForeignPtr Doublecode I would just be commuting the problem of how to access the address value of a codestructcode member to the codepeekcode implementation for that instance.p  pSo in summary, how can I access an address value i.e. pointer codestructcode member in such a way that I can use it as an argument to codeunsafeFromForeignPtrcodep

Negative 51855 pEdit The rules are that I cannot modify the formula. The methods have to be void and I must pass the preinitialized array to those methods. These are the constraints that will be present for the future assignment itself, which is why Im trying to play around with this namebag program this way.p  pI am trying to write a namebag program for fun and also for practice for a future assignment. The goal is to let the user have a bag. In this bag, they can store 25 names. They can add 1 name at a time, remove 1 name at a time, sort the bag so that the names are in alphabetical order, etc. Basic array exercises. Im running into some issues since Im not very familiar with Java, though. I have a function that takes the array, converts it into a list, attempts to add a name of the users choice, and then attempts to convert that list BACK to the array that it once was. And then I have another function that attempts to display everything in the array.p  pThis code works when I avoid using a menu, the switch case, and methods. I can store things into the name bag and I can display the names without any problem and without displaying the null values. But I dont understand why the names wont display in the code down below.

Negative 51855 pThere seem to be a number of ways to do polymorphism in Perl but they all feel hacky to me. Im somewhat new to Perl so I could just be interpreting it wrong but I find most examples make your code too illegible and are controversial.p  pSay you have a widget class that contains some data and methods that all widgets need. There are also a handful of widget types i.e. calender, schedule, etc. And they need to communicate with each other via a parent container class.p  pWould playing with the namespace and making widget a prototype be worth itbr Should I give each widget a reference to an object one of the types at instantiationbr Just forget about types being objects and make widget a large class where only a few methods get used per instance based on what type is set. Something elsep  pI come from a CC background and Im finding it difficult to decide on a Perl programming model.p  pAlso, Im dont have strong type safety or private member requirements. The project is a mid sized web app with a couple developers and portability to other projects isnt a priority. Easy extensibilty without needing to decipher Perl hacks would be useful though.p

Negative 51855 pSince about 2 months, we have updated our website with a directory of coaches which can be found on multiple search templates such as a hrefhttpwww.sollicitatiedokter.nlcoaching relnofollowhttpwww.sollicitatiedokter.nlcoachinga .p  pWeve created multiple sitemaps, sitemap pages, added coaching to Google Webmaster Tools requested it to be crawled and with it the links on this page.

Negative 51855 pI have a webservice that I need to consume files from. The problem is this webservice limits API calls to 100MB but the files are larger then 100MB. So they recommended we use the the Range header. I added the range to the HttpWebRequest. My problem seems to be combining the Streams. I think it stems from the fact that I cannot create a instance of the ConnectSream which I think is what GetResponseStream returns. So I have to create a MemoryStream instead.

Negative 51855 pI am interfacing SD cards 12GB SD cards  and 4GB SDHC cards from different manufactures to a custom board in SPI mode and I am using a FATfs file system from elmchan.  I am able to write files and read files on the SD card. However I would like to know where can I get the information on the maximum clock frequency I can drive my SPI bus for the given SD card.  I have seen that for some SD cards maximum speed was about 1.33MHz and for some 20MHz.  I assumed this speed was in the CSD register TAAC value, as the TRANSPEED was the same on all the cards set at 25Mhz. However I realized its not true. I would really appreciate if someone can share their knowledge on this. Thanksp

Negative 51855 pIm trying to export a PDF with embedded transparent TIFF images. These images have extremely large dimensions. During the embed process, they are shrunk down to fit in the placeholder frames within the target InDesign file. Because of the dramatic decrease in size, when I then export a PDF from the InDesign file I get a halo affect from the antialiasing around the edges of the embedded images. Ive had some luck reducing the size of the halo by telling InDesign to not downsample, but I havent been able to eliminate it. Does anyone know a way to get rid of this artifactp

Negative 51855 pI am well aware that this question has been asked plenty of times before but so much has happened with XPath and similar that I figured it might be time to do so again.p  pIn my thesis I will attempt to implement a program to perform Threeway merge of slx files Matlab Simulink. What seems to be the easiest way to do this is to manipulate the xml files building the slx file.p  pI cant seem to find any fairly recent discussion on DOM vs XPath vs ElementTree Python, most questions seem to be 35 years old.p  pAs far as I have understood from older posts is that DOM is more flexible and creates a DOM object which contains all the nodes and allow me to manipulate the file seems very useful. XPath is more suited for choosing particular values or relationships within the tree since its faster and uses less memory. ElementTree is something I just came across browsing through the questions here and I cant seem to figure out which of these three will be of most use.p

Negative 51855 pI have kinda pieced together a script out of some that I have found online to do a quick home automation demo for proof of concept with a Raspberry Pi. I later realized it could also be used as a no response terminal as well. Sorry for not giving credit to the original owners of the code, as I dont remember where I even found it, and there are not credits in it to begin with.p  pAnyway. I have made my own changes to it, and it works great. I set it up as an upstart daemon on the pi, and it runs find and operates as it should for 25 days. It then will hang, somewhere in the script, and never actually executes the except to do the error handling. Actually, 2 out of the 3 scripts that I have written and running as daemons will do this. I am not that advanced of a coder, but I am always trying to learn and improve my skills. So please bare with me on this.

Negative 51855 pI have a routine that is meant to load and parse data from a file. There is a possibility that the data from the same file might need to be retrieved from two places at once, i.e. during a background caching process and from a user request.p  pSpecifically I am using C11 thread and mutex libraries. We compile with Visual C 11 aka 2012, so are limited by whatever it lacks.p  pMy naive implementation went something like thisp  precodemapltwstring,weakptrltDataStructgtgt datacache mutex datacachemutex  sharedptrltDataStructgt ParseDataFilewstring filepath      auto dataptr  makesharedltDataStructgt       Parses and processes the data, may take a while       return dataptr   sharedptrltDataStructgt CreateStructFromDatawstring filepath      lockguardltmutexgt lockdatacachemutex      auto cacheiter  datacache.findfilepath     if cacheiter  enddatacache          auto dataptr  cacheitergtsecond.lock         if dataptr             return dataptr          reference died, remove it         datacache.erasecacheiter           auto dataptr  ParseDataFilefilepath      if dataptr         datacache.emplacemakepairfilepath, dataptr      return dataptr  codepre  pMy goals were twofoldp  ul liAllow multiple threads to load separate files concurrentlyli liEnsure that a file is only processed onceli ul  pThe problem with my current approach is that it doesnt allow concurrent parsing of multiple files at all. If I understand what will happen correctly, theyre each going to hit the lock and end up processing linearly, one thread at a time. It may change from run to run the order which the threads pass through the lock first, but the end result is the same.p  pOne solution Ive considered was to create a second mapp  precodemapltwstring,mutexgt dataparsingmutex  sharedptrltDataStructgt ParseDataFilewstring filepath      lockguardltmutexgt lockdataparsingmutex[filepath]      etc.      dataparsingmutex.erasefilepath  codepre  pBut now I have to be concerned with how codedataparsingmutexcode is being updated.

Negative 51855 pI know this is a beginners problem but I cannot progress with my studies until I understand what is going on here. In an if block that Im executing in Update, I cannot understand why the two if statements are executed simultaneously. I thought that as soon as the initiative variable was initialized at the start of the block, the compiler would move down to the first if statement to see if the condition is true. If it is true, it would execute the code in that block until the timer reached zero. Then it would move down to the next.

Another way to define reverse isp  precodereverse  [a] gt [a] reverse []  [] reverse xxs  reverse xs  [x] codepre      pHowever this definition is more wasteful than the one in Prelude as it   repeatedly reconses the result as it is accumulated.

Negative 51855 pIm wondering if there is a static checker that will look at my javascript sources and tell me which native functions I should not use or use differently if I want my scripts to work across browsers.p  pFor example Chrome does not know codeString.containscode but Firefox does. I would want to be warned that I should avoid codeString.containscode completely.p  pAnother example would be the usage of codeArray.sortcode, which only works correctly across browsers if your compare function returns a codeNumbercode. All browsers will also accept codebooleancode values but not behave consistently in this case. A warning about the return type would be great. Analysis would be much more complex and maybe not even possible.p  pDoes somebody know about a static checker that warns about nonECMA usage of native functions. I searched but did not find anything.p

Negative 51855 pI want to develop an App that uses the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsprovidersdocumentprovider.html relnofollowStorage Access Frameworka but processes the provided files with JNI native code.p  pVia the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsprovidersdocumentprovider.html relnofollowStorage Access Frameworka I get a codeUricode after a call to codestartActivityForResultcode with a codeIntent.ACTIONOPENDOCUMENTcode intent.

Once the native code is done, it saves the result to a temporary file whose path is passed back to the Java side. The Java code then reads the temporary file and puts its content into a codeFileOutputStreamcode obtained from the codeuricode.p  pThis is obviously horribly inefficient and ugly.p

Negative 51855 pIm trying to configure Grunt so that whenever a linked .css file changes, the jade template which references the .css also livereloads.  I cannot compile my jade templates, as far as I know, because the template in question is formatting a response from an API.  So, unless there is a change to the .jade file, the .css is not pulled in again.  I can manually refresh the page to view the style change, but Im trying to automate it.p  pRight now, if I change a .jade file, the .jade file in question livereloads and I can see the template changes in my browser immediately.  If I change a .css file, grunt detects it and reloads the .css file.  However, since the .jade file has already been rendered into .html, the styling does not update.p  pEDIT Ive since determined that ONLY Jade files which include formatting API call data are affected.

Negative 51855 pIs it possible to create an entity with a port that is an array of stdlogicvectors, with both the size of the array and the stdlogicvector coming from generics Ie. is it possible to create eg. a bus multiplexer with both the bus width and bus count configurablep  precodeentity busmultiplexer is         generic buswidth  positive  8                 selwidth  positive  2         port   i  in arrayinteger range 2selwidth  1 downto 0 of stdlogicvectorbuswidth  1 downto 0                 sel  in stdlogicvectorselwidth  1 downto 0                 o  out stdlogicvectorbuswidth  1 downto 0 end busmultiplexer  architecture dataflow of busmultiplexer is begin         o lt itointegerunsignedsel end dataflow codepre  pThe above doesnt seem to work because the array type needs to be defined separately. Defining the type before the port also does not work, as then it expects the entity definition to end after it. Defining it after the port definition doesnt work since itd be used before that. Defining it in a package doesnt work because the type definition doesnt seem to like having an unconstrained range in the base type.p  pIs it possible to somehow do this in VHDL93 What about VHDL2008p  pDefining the type as codearraynatural range ltgt, natural range ltgt of stdlogiccode in the package works  as in the port definition doesnt give an error  but actually using it if its defined that way seems to be quite unwieldy.p  pIs there some sane way to use it like this Is there some simple way to map N separate stdlogicvectors to a port defined like that, and likewise for the actual output logicp  pI tried the original and codeo lt itointegerunsignedsel, buswidth  1 downto 0code, but neither worked. I know I could do it one bit at a time, but Id prefer something simpler. And while the bitbybit approach might be okay for the internal implementation, I certainly wouldnt want to have to do that for the port mapping every time I use the component...p  pIs there some saneish way to do thisp  pemAddendum I know there are some similar questions, but most of them dont deal with the case of both ranges coming from generics, and were solved using a type definition in a package. The one that did talk about two generic dimensions apparently didnt need the input to come from distinct stdlogicvectors and ended up using the 2darray of stdlogic method, which doesnt work for me at least without further clarification about how to use it without losing ones sanityemp

Negative 51855 pI havent coded in a few years and have been writing simple Java programs to refamiliarize myself with basic principles.  However, Im having trouble getting my dowhile loop to act how I want it to.  I guess Im not understanding exactly how dowhile loops work, but what I want is to gather user input from System.in as an int, and continue to ask for a valid int input if they enter some other data form.

First, if I enter a nonint value, it immediately crashes throwing an input mismatch exception.  Second, if I do enter a valid int, I always have to enter it twice.  I.E., the console will ask for Input , Ill enter say 2, the console will advance to the next line and wait for another input but without printing anything, and then when I enter a second int it outputs the You chose to [...].p  pI have tried over a dozen different variations that just keep getting more complex, while loops inside dowhile, inside ifelse, but Im sure Im over complicating matters and am missing a simple concept.

Negative 51855 pI just want to control the stack size for all of my threads in a Java groovy application. For the Hotspot Oracle VM, I know that there are two parameters doing that  a hrefhttpwww.onkarjoshi.comblog209usingxsstoadjustjavadefaultthreadstacksizetosavememoryandpreventstackoverflowerror relnofollowcodeXsscodea and a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkjavajavasetechvmoptionsjsp140102.html relnofollowcodeXXThreadStackSizecodea.p  pWhich is the preferred one Is there any difference between them Regarding Open JDK 7 a hrefhttpmail.openjdk.java.netpipermailhotspotdev2011June004272.html relnofollowsomeone asked on the mailing lista, stating that codeXsscode is the same for the Hotpot VM as codeXXThreadStackSizecode. p  pThe point is, that I am measuring how many threads can be started on my system. My groovy script which does this looks likep  precodeint count  0  def printCountThreads        printlnXXX There were started count threads.   try      whiletrue             new ThreadThread.sleepInteger.MAXVALUE.start             count             ifcount  1000  0                     printCountThreads                    catch Throwable e     printCountThreads     throw e  codepre  pInterestingly enough I just get a reduced number of of threads using codeXXThreadStackSizecode. I am starting the groovy application with and with different content in the environment variable JAVAOPTS. p  precodegroovy countmaxthreads.groovy codepre  pWhen I set JAVAOPTS to codeXXThreadStackSize2mcode, I get about 1000 started threads until the memory is consumed. But, when I use codeJAVAOPTSXss2mcode, I get about 32000 threads until the expected error arises. So it seems that codeXsscode does not work at all. p  pI am using p  pjava version 1.8.005br JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.8.005b13br Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM build 25.5b02, mixed mode  p  pon a ubuntu 14.04 64 bit machine with four hardware threads and about 8 GB of RAM.p  pUPDATEp  pI reverified this on my windows 7 64 bit machine and another JDKp  pjava version 1.8.020 JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.8.020b26 Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM build 25.20b23, mixed modep  pand there codeXsscode and codeXXThreadStackSizecode work as expected as some answers pointed out. So I suppose it is a Linux specific problem or even a bug in the JDK version 1.8.05.p

Negative 51855 pSo far, in a program that I am writing, I have been using arrays to store data about line segments. For the sake of the question, lets assume these arrays only contain integers that define start x1, y1 and end x2, y2 coordinates.p  precodeInteger[] lineData  x1, y1, x2, y2 codepre  pIn my program, I need to continuously perform operations on the data contained in multiple such arrays using for loops.p  pIn the course of writing the program, I have, numerous times, realized that I need more data about those segments. As a result, I added elements to the array, which grew larger, for instancep  precodeInteger[] lineData  x1, y1, x2, y2, slope, red, green, blue, width codepre  pThis has become hard to manage, since I need to remember the position of each integer data to perform operations on it and it is very tedious to implement changes to the array, such as swapping the position of two elements, since I need to update the index of the elements in every part of the program that performs operations on them.p  pThis has led me to the probably obvious idea to create a emlineDataem class which contains the integers as its fieldsp  precodepublic class LineData   public int x1,y1,x2,y2,slope, red, green, blue, width  LineDataint x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int slope, int red, int green, int blue, int width     this.x1  x1     this.y1  y1     this.x2  x2     this.y2  y2     this.slope  slope     this.red  red     this.green  green     this.blue  blue     this.width  width   public int getX1      return x1   public void setX1int x1      this.x1  x1   public int getY1      return y1   public void setY1int y1      this.y1  y1   public int getX2      return x2   public void setX2int x2      this.x2  x2   public int getY2      return y2   public void setY2int y2      this.y2  y2   public int getSlope      return slope   public void setSlopeint slope      this.slope  slope   public int getRed      return red   public void setRedint red      this.red  red   public int getGreen      return green   public void setGreenint green      this.green  green   public int getBlue      return blue   public void setBlueint blue      this.blue  blue   public int getWidth      return width   public void setWidthint width      this.width  width   codepre  pThis looks like a good solution. p  pMy concern, though, is that accessing and changing the fields of the emlineDataem class will be slower than accessing and changing the elements in the array. The reason behind my concern is the belief that Arrays exist for a reason.p  pAnother argument for using a emlineListem class is the need to store data about the line segments that are not integers, but Strings, Booleans and other custom objects.p  pHowever, please disregard that argument. I would like to compare an integer array with a class containing solely integer fields. p  pSumming up, my questions arep  pWhich one is faster an array of x integers or an object containing x integer fields How did you solve the described issue when you faced it in the past If using an object with fields is slower than using an array, did you still decide to use an object with fields Whyp  pPlease take into account that there is a very high number of those arrays, so changing the arrays to objects with fields would create a very high number of instantiated objects that are looped over  maybe this has an effect on performancep  pThanks a lot in advance for your helpp

Negative 51855 pIm writing a library that wraps some of Media Foundation functionality. I want to be able to notify a library user through a callback of when a webcam is connecteddisconnected tofrom the system. a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopdd94032828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDN describes how to know when a camera is disconencteda, but it uses message loop to let you know of that. I dont know Windows message loops too well, but what I have read in a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64492828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowthis MSDN articlea tells me that I must have a window in order to have a message loop, which is unacceptable for a library.p  pSo, I have several questionsp  ol lipCan I create a message loop in a new thread and receive those notification messages described by the first link I want it to be in a new thread so that it doesnt block the library users thread then the library user calls codesetCameraChangeCallback...code, which starts the message loop inside. If so, which functions for creating message loop should I usepli lipCan I do that without creating any windows Its a library, so it would be very odd if a library user called codesetCameraChangeCallback...code and a window suddenly appeared. Again, an explanation of how to do that function names, specific arguments to use, etc. is very welcome.pli lipCan my library be used without issues in a Windows application Meaning that a Windows application that would be using my library is likely to already have a window created and its own message loop running. Would my message loop running in the separate thread interfere with library users message loop If so, how to avoid thatpli lipDoes anything stop me from creating two or more threads with message loops, each registered to get notified for the camera change eventpli ol

Negative 51855 pIn a normal freestyle project, I configure the SCM plugin to point to the Git repo that I want to release, and I enable the Poll SCM option, which allows me to configure a Stash webhook to tell Jenkins whenever there has been a change to that repo. In this way, the job can be triggered whenever a change is pushed to the repo.p  pBut when I use a workflow instead of a freestyle project, the SCM of the code that I need to build is specified programmatically in the groovy workflow script, which means that it is not listening for the Stash webhook. Instead, the SCM that is configured directly in the workflow is the SCM of the groovy script itself, which is different than the codebase that I am trying to buildrelease, so I dont want the trigger to be based on that. p  precodenodedockerbuilder      git url serviceRepo     releaseVersion  getVersion     pipelineSpec  getPipelineSpec     sh .gradlew clean build pushDockerImage  codepre  pAny ideas about how to achieve SCM polling when using the workflow plugin p

Negative 51855 pWe would like to share an ADOConnection across a DLL boundary Delphi to Delphi at the moment, though could also be C to Delphi in the near future.p  pAs we would like the flexibility to call the DLL from c in future, we were hoping to be able to define the DLL call using Connection as a parameter. Something likep  precodeprocedure DoStuff ADOConnection Connection var   InnerConnection TADOConnection begin   InnerConnection  TADOConnection.createnil   try     InnerConnection.ConnectionObject  ADOConnection     DoMoreStuffInnerConnection   finally     InnerConnection.free   end end codepre  pUnfortunately, the TADOConnection destructor code closes the connection passed into it, which is an unwanted sideeffect. Addingp  precodeInnerConnection.ConnectionObject  nil codepre  pprior to the free doesnt do anything, as its caught byp  precodeif AssignedValue  nil codepre  pin TADOConnection.SetConnectionObject, which results in the call not doing anything.p  pIs there a better way of achieving this Passing the connection string is an alternative, but would mean that we would have to deal with usernamepassword issues and encryption across the boundary. Passing the TADOConnection is another option, but that prevents calling from other languages.p  pEdit For clarity, the UsernamePassword of the original TADOConnection object is set using the .Open routine, so these details arent in the connection string in fact, the wrong username is usually stored, as its the name used to test connection in the MS UDL editorp

Negative 51855 pCurrently in my C project I am using IKVM and Drools.NET to handle a large amount of very simple business rules.

Negative 51855 pI am currently learning Rust and looking to use it for developing a GUI based application with GTK. My problem relates to registering callbacks to respond to GTK eventssignals and mutating state within those callbacks. I have a working but inelegant solution, so I would like to ask if there is a cleaner, more idiomatic solution.p  pI have implemented my code as a struct with method implementations, where the struct maintains references to the GTK widgets along with other state that it needs. It constructs a closure that is passed to the codeGtkWidgetconnectcode functions in order to receive events, draw to a canvas, etc. This can cause problems with the borrow checker, as I will now explain.

So I am not quite sure if programmers.stackexchange.com is more suitable  but this question is totally focused on Java and I want a Java solutionp  pstrongExamplestrong There is a text editor that loads several plugins who are responsible for their file type interaction in the text editor Java plugin handles Java codefiles, CC plugin handles CC codefiles etc.  each plugin needs a configuration and access to the file manager. These plugins have to access an application API to do some useful stuff without reinventing the wheel. Keep in mind, that for example the file manager of the application also needs dataobjects itself For example a configuration with line separator type, type of read mode etc..p  pstrongQuestionstrong How can I pass the configurationfile manager to an pugin Based on an interface or abstract class in a modularized application when the file manager also need a configuration itselfp  pstrongProblemsThings to keep in mindstrongp  ul liWe need to pass data to the file manager Configuration etc.li liJava doesnt support custom constructors in interfaces and abstract classesli liAnnotationed objects are hard to test and often the root of all evilli liTry to create a properclear API and make it hard as possible to abuseuse the API in a wring wayli ul  pstrongSolution 1strong Use dependency injection via annotation in the plugins, so we can get the configuration and file manager and use them in our plugins.

Ive also additionally discovered that bitstrings of length codencode bits where codencode is not a multiple of 8 CHARBIT, the number of bits in a byte lose the least significant bits from the least significant byte. For example, if my bitstring is 14 bits, then 2 bytes 16 bits are needed to store the bitstring, with byte zero being most significant and byte 1 being least. We lose bits 0 and 1 the two least significant bits from the least significant byte, namely byte 1.

Negative 51855 pI want to visualize a 3D polyhedron which consists of polygons not always triangles and in which all parts are coloured facets, edges and vertices. Is it possible to do that in some polyhedron format Stanford PLY format support edge colours, but I failed to find the visualization program that supports edges colouring in PLY format. For example, Paraview can color facets, but it cant color edges even if the input PLY file contains colored edges.p
