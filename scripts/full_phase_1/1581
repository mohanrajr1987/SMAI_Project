Positive 1581 pSo my problem is that we are trying to set up a WordPress site on a Windows server 2012 under IIS. I used WebPI to install PHP and used the PHP Manager to configure it. We have a database server at 10.0.0.x which runs both SQL Server and MySQL. We got it all set up, but WordPress doesnt connect.

It connected, ran the query, and returned the value. MySQL Workbench was also able to connect. I was able to determine that WordPress is using codemysqlicode with a fallback to the codemysqlcode library. And thats probably why its failing to connect.

You are the experts and I am a novice requiring help with future coding. If there is a section aimed at this kind of thing, I will be happy to repost.p  pHere is the situationp  pI am starting work on an advanced admin backend panel for my staff, an idea I currently have is to use a MySQLi database to create the staff rota, to be displayed in a simple calendar like table on the aPanel. p  pNow, the advanced part is the staff member will be able to click codeClock Incode or codeClock Outcode during the timesdays they are issued on the rota.p  pThe system will NOT let the staff member codeClock Incode, unless they are on the rota for that time of day. I will then have access to a management section of the panel allowing me to view the amount of hours the staff member has been clocked in for for if they have missed days, or are late, etc... And pay them for recorded clocked in hours. p  pMaybe some added features would be that they are clocked out automatically at the end of their shift or the system would record overtime and suchp  pI have no idea how I would go about creating such system or if it is actually possible so if anybody may have any advicetipsexamples for such idea I would appreciate any help p  pAll the best p

Negative 1581 pFor the successful use case, the PostRedirectGet PRG work flow is pretty simple simply redirect clientside to the desired page. But what about cases when errors are encountered during serverside validation and we want to preserve the inputs when we display the input page againp  pAs far as I can tell, there are two approaches simply rerender the input page after the form POST submission i.e. no redirection during errors thus disregarding the PRG pattern or, redirect to the input page, and store the previous inputs somewhere it can be retrieved later e.g. session, during rendering. Both have drawbacks in the first, we are presented with the problems PRG pattern helps us to avoid e.g. bookmarkability, double submission the second approach leads to inconsistent GETs first GET will find the stored inputs, subsequent GETs might not. Are there other alternatives to those mentioned here I am hoping for inputs from the community on how this case is best handled. p

Negative 1581 pWe have made a .NET service application to send emails to all the registered users of our website.p  pWe have 2,634,789 users and the mail has to go to all of them.

Negative 1581 pHere is my issue, it appears that all the communication lines for the PIC 16F913 reside on the same set of pins, this is convenient in that I dont have to sacrifice GPIO pins just to do comms, however the problem Im having now is if Im using the SPI on the chip, how can I send information to the RS232 p  pThe reason this issue came up, is that I just bought a CAN bus chip that communicates over SPI, and I would really like to see the data on RS232, so I can see messages. I really dont know much about CAN yet, so who knows if this even makes sense yet.p  pHere are the options I see, and maybe someone else has better ideas that Im just simply missing.p  ol liSomehow setup a time scheme that will switch between SPI and RS232 every time I get data, li ol  p This doesnt seem hard and should work, but supposing I dont want to miss a message, what if a message is written while Im writing to RS232, is it possible Ill miss itp  p2.. I can always use SPI, but then build my own comm bus over 8 of the GPIO lines, to another PIC 16F913, using only the GPIO lines and then since the RS232 lines are free on the second PIC I can simply read the data and spit it out.p  p This one is doable but now were wasting 2 chips, AND all the GPIO lines,p  pThere has to be a better way. Or is therep  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pUpdate I would like to clarify, obviously one solution is using a completely different chip which may in fact be what I end up doing, if I can get the 18F programmed, however, Im interested in worst case scenario, in which I am limited in resources and only have some 913s, is the way described above the only way to do it with this chip, or is there a better wayp

The Units table canwill contain duplicate records Serial Numbersp  pA call can have 0Many children records in the Units table.p  pSo, when a caller calls in, our Cust Rep enters a Serial Number always creates a new record in the Units table, which associates it with this call. At that point we populate a Call History tab. This tab is built by the query below. Search the Units table and finds all Units that match this Unit and then returns all Calls that are assigned to all of those Units records.p  pTo summarize. The objective of the query is based on the callID, find ANY other calls in the database that are also tied to ANY of the serial numbers that are assigned to this call.p  pConsidering the Entity Framework created a Navigation in the tblCall table called Categories and in the tblCategory table called Call, there has to be a bettermore efficient way to write this query.

Negative 1581 pSo I have an application which uses threads. Now when the program first starts up, I want it to go through setting up database connections and whatnot before it backgrounds itself so that whateverwhoever starts the program can know if there was an error starting up.p  pI did some looking around and have found some resources that say do not mix fork and threads, while others say that forking in linux will only duplicate the main thread and leave the others alone.br In the case of the latter where it just duplicates the main thread, how then do the threads access file level global variables Will the threads not be able to access the variables that are now in the forked processs address spacep  pUltimately the goal is to have the application background itself after threads have been created. If this is not possible, I can put the fork before the thread creation, just would like to do it as late as possible.p  pNote at the time of the fork, the threads will be doing a sleep loop until the main thread puts data into a shared variable for them to process. So if the sleep gets interrupted, they wont be harmed.p

When I use jQuery 1.4.4 the content is loaded allright and when I append the loaded content it also loads all the  javascripts.p  pThe problem comes when I wanna user jQuery 1.5.2. The external javascripts no longer load. They aint even appear in the net requests. Any funny behavior or setting Im missingp  pThanksp

Negative 1581 pFor a final project, my friends and I are making a game. Were using GLUT I know, not the best choice. What we would like to do is to have multiple display callback functions for different modes of the game eg. splash screen, menu screen, gameplay screen, etc., so when the game mode changes, we change the callback. So in effect, its sort of like being able to call codeglutDisplayFunccode while GLUT is running. Is this possible Were reluctant to have a giant ifswitch statement in an overall display function because we think it may hinder performance. If this concern is unfounded, please say sop

Negative 1581 pIm developing a Web application, and there is a page when user must submit files which are saved into temporary folder on the server. If everything goes well, I send ajax request to the server to remove users uploaded file. But, if user closes the browser or shutdown the computer, I cant detect that. p  pIn this case, what is the best way to gurantee that unused files are not stored forever The site is developed in ASP.NET MVC and will be hosted on II7. Does IIS7 provides some configuration to deal with temporary files Or I need to implement some service, which will be executed in a background with low priority and periodically check if there are old files to be removedp  pAny help is very much appreciated.p

Negative 1581 pI have a root entity with multiple onetomany associations. I would like to create a query that eagerly loads all the associations for an entity with a given ID. If I am using the ICriteria API and assign FetchMode.Eager the generated SQL will result in a Cartesian product, which I would like to avoid. The documentation for FetchMode.Select seems to be what I am looking for, but does not force eager loading. After searching around there appears to be a documentation bug with FetchMode.Select. a hrefhttpayende.comblog4367eagerlyloadingentityassociationsefficientlywithnhibernate relnofollowThisa post by Ayende explains how to eagerly load associations, however an issue with the generated SQL is that the additional select statements select from the root entity table first before joining the association. I would like to avoid that where it is not necessary, such as when I am loading a onetomany using the ID of the root entity. The SQL query generated when calling NHibernateUtil.Initialize on a lazy loaded association is what I am looking for, but I would like for it to be part of the initial query. Ive also tried doing a Future query or using HQL to select the association without success. I either get an exception which states that the root entity must be part of the select or I get the same result as in the post by Ayende. Overall, what I am looking for seems to be within reach, I want the query generated by calling NHibernateUtil.Initialize to be part of the initial query. A similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1905137forceaneagerselectinnhibernatequestiona remains unanswered. p  pI am using NHibernate v3.1 with FluentNHibernate.p

Negative 1581 pFirst time posting here. Thanks for taking the time to review the issue.p  pAs the title indicates the question is in regards to the service layer of a flex application. Specifically in a test case class. To call the services the user must first authenticate through an htmlCF based page. Once thats done and the authentication has occurred the user is directed to the html page with the flex application embedded in. Once authenticated the server side CF code writes a cookie to the users computer. This cookie is then read by the flex app and is required for the flex app to make calls to the CF services.p  pThe question is how should this be handled in a test case class for the service class in the flex app The following steps need to basically take place use some account data to hit the server and authenticate, the cookie then needs to be written which it will already, then the test case needs to pick up the session id from the cookie and pass it to the service call within the test case. That just all seems like too much for a test case class.p  pSo, how is this type of thing usually handled. From what I gather its typical for web service calls to require a session id like this.p  pAny thoughts, input, suggestions, etc. are greatly appreciated.p  pThanks for your time and any information you can provide.p  pSeanp

Negative 1581 pI recently coded a .C file with scanf in order to take keyboard inputs.  To my great surprise, the cygwin terminal converted all the letters I typed to numbers. My program ran properly though.  The cygwin terminal just didnt show the correct input that I typed.  It even converted some nonalphabet keys into symbols.p  pIf I pressed the same alphabet key multiple times, the numbers showing up in the cygwin terminal would change each time I pressed the key.  I talked to my computer science professor about this and he didnt know how to fix it.p  pAnother thing to be noted is that my professor was able to use the cygwin executable via the command terminal in order to run my .C file.

In this case four is the darkest lens.ltpgt ltpgtampquotCategory four is suitable for exceptionally sunny conditions such as skiing, but beware, as they are illegal for driving in as they do not allow sufficient light transmission through the lens,ampquot noted the expert.ltpgt ltpgtWhile many skiers opt for goggles to hit the slopes, sunglasses are a popular alternative.ltpgt ltpgtFurthermore, skiers who prefer wearing goggles for the sport should also pack a pair of sunglasses, for a less chunky alternative for other outdoor activities.ltpgt ltpgtEven cloudy days on the slopes require eye protection, as the reflection of light off snow is still significant.ltpgt ltpgtWhile some sort of eye protection is clearly important on this type of trip, what style should skiers go forltpgt ltpgtThose intending to spend more time sipping hot chocolate in the cosy lodge than out on the slopes should go for bold, designer shades, with oversized frames being a popular option.ltpgt ltpgtPeople who prefer function over fashion on the other hand need to opt for a pair of shades that will stay on, such as Oakleys.ltpgt ltpgtPosted by Martin Carlinltpgt]]gtltdescriptiongt ltmediathumbnail urlhttpwww.website.co.ukimgSunglassesareimportantforskiersduetothehighlevelsofUVradiationtheyareexposedto16000539800747215007047638300.jpg height300 width203 gt ltpubDategtMon, 03 Oct 2011 165709 0000ltpubDategt ltitemgt .... .... ltchannelgt ltrssgt codepre

Negative 1581 pIm using ANTLR to parse logical expressions in a Java tool Im writing, and Im having issues because passing invalid input strings to the generated ANTLR lexer and parser doesnt cause any exceptions. Instead of throwing a RecognitionException, like I would expect, the generated files just print the error message to the console and return as if no errors occurred, causing my program to crash when it runs into the empty data later. p  pI used ANTLRWorks version 1.4.3 to generate the files, and it seems like there should be some sort of option to have it actually throw errors rather than print to the console, but I havent found anything. Does anyone know how to get ANTLR to actually throw error messages I saw that this same issue in C was solved by using an older version of ANTLR, is that what I need to dop  pEDIT After Bart pointed me in the direction of what I was looking for, I found this pagep  pa hrefhttpwww.antlr.orgwikidisplayANTLR3MigratingfromANTLR2toANTLR3httpwww.antlr.orgwikidisplayANTLR3MigratingfromANTLR2toANTLR3ap  pwhose Error handling section had code that did what I want more exactly. To change the way ANTLR catches exceptions, you can say this in the grammar file p  precoderulecatch     catch RecognitionException e      throw e      codepre  pThis makes forces ANTLR to throw the exception instead of handling it and recovering.

Negative 1581 pIn order to facilitate security for some WCF calls, I need to create certificates for a group of machines that will be running my custom software.  Most of the clients will be running Windows XP.  To make the process as painless as possible for the end user, the certificate request should be automatically generated during the install procedure and passed back to a server hosted by our support department.  This server will take the CSR, create the needed certificate and return it to the computer that is being set up.  p  pI have been able to create my own root certificate and programatically install it into the root certification authority, and I know how to create a CSR and write it to a file in Base64 format with the proper header and footer.  However, I cant seem to find what I need to do with it once I receive it on the server end.  I assume I need to decode it and create a certificate using the contained information, but I cant find any documentation on how to do this.  I have found out that I need to convert it back from base64 and strip the headers out with CryptStringToBinary, but when I take the resulting information and try to decode it using CryptDecodeObjectEx, it fails and returns an error message indicating that an ASN.1 tag contains a bad value.  I have run the same CSR through an online decoder and it works correctly.  Can someone please tell me what Im missing herep
Negative 1581 pOurs is a product specific to a domain.Here are some of the typical security use cases,p  ol liA normal User can edit only his profile data or anybody data based on permissionli liA user can see only data that belongs to his department while another user can data from all departmentsli ol  pThese requirements changes from customer to customer so we can not just hard code the filtering logic in our application code or maintain multiple versions of the application.p  pWe use Hibernate criteria based filtering and like to add additional Restrictions based on some expressions associated with a Permission. An expression for use case 1, mentioned above, may look like this, codeuserIduser.userIdcode where user is a keyword and represents current authenticated user and userId is a property of the object for which criteria is created. p  pWe want to define a dsl using which we can derive criteria restriction as well as where clause for sql. p  pAre there any existing frameworks which will enable us to do it, without going for dsl Based on the use cases mentioned above, do you think it can be achieved in different wayp  pAdditional Info We define only domain objects with some meta information to generate UI.

Negative 1581 pIm still relatively unfamiliar with all the new features of iOS 5, and what I can do in Xcode now. So, a good explanation would be appreciated.p  pIm designed a singleview application and I have both an iPhone and iPad storyboard. I chose Single View Application when I first started, so Xcode created a ViewController for me. Both storyboards list this view controller as their own.p  pBack in iOS 4 the way that I linked button actions to my view controller was to RightClick on the button on the nib, pick the action that I wanted, then drag it over into the view controllers .h file, which autocreated a methodproperty for me.p  pI am confused about how to accomplish this now, since I have multiple storyboards but only one view controller. Do I need to have multiple links for each button one for the button on the iPhone and one for the iPad Or is there a better way to accomplish what I am trying to do nowp

At some stage the latter calls begin to fail with the above exceptions.p  pOn the COM side the apartment uses a hidden window whose winproc looks like thisp  precodetypedef stdfunctionltvoidvoidgt Functor LRESULT CALLBACK WndProcHWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam          switchmsg              case AMFUNCTOR            Functor f  reinterpretcastltFunctor gtlParam       f       delete f          break        case WMCLOSE          DestroyWindowhwnd        break        default          return DefWindowProchwnd, msg, wParam, lParam            return 0      codepre  pThe events are posted to this window from other parts of the COM serverp  precodevoid postconst Functor ampfunc    Functor f  new Functorfunc   PostMessagehWind, AMFUNCTOR, 0, reinterpretcastltLPARAMgtf  codepre  pThe events are standard ATL CP implementations bound with the actual params, and they boil down to something like thisp  precodepConnectiongtInvokeid, IIDNULL, LOCALEUSERDEFAULT, DISPATCHMETHOD, ampparams, ampvarResult, NULL, NULL codepre  pIn C the handler looks like thisp  precodeprivate void onEventIMyCollection objs    int len  objs.Count  usually 10000  25000   foreach IMyObj obj in objs         some of the following calls fail with 0x80010100     int id  obj.id     string name  obj.name      etc...     codepre  pp  pSo, can the above problem happen just because the messagequeue of the apartment is too loaded with the events it tries to deliver Or the message loop should be totally blocked to cause such a behaviourp  pLets assume that the messagequeue has 2 sequential events that evaluate to onEvent call. The first one enters C managed code, which attempts to reenter the unmanaged code, the same apartment. Usually, this is allowed, and we do this a lot. When, under what circumstances can it failp  pThanks.p

Negative 1581 pThe format of codeDateTime.UtcNow.ToStringcode is  codeDDMMYYYY HHMMSScodep  pThe format that SQL Server Express expects is  codeYYYYMMDD HHMMSScodep  pThe format of codeSqlDateTimeDateTime.UtcNowcode is  codeDDMMYYYY HHMMSScodep  pAs far as I know both are UK formats. I am in the UK and running the code and SQL Server Express on the same machine.p  pI know I could specify the format in the codeToStringcode method but that doesnt answer the underlying problem.

Negative 1581 pIm trying to figure out how to set up openvpn on my linux mint so I can connect to it with my android TMobile HTC MyTouch 4G Slide device.  I think Im part way there but I am still having fits getting it to connect.p  pSo far I have installed openswan, openssl and tinyca I was able to create a CA certificate and a request certificate in tinyca. If I am reading it correct it creates them using the openssl settings so I copied the etcsslcertMyserverCert.pem and etcsslprivateMyserverKey.pem to the appropriate directories in etcipsec.d I copied the example l2tppsk.conf into etcipsec.d and modified the left to my eth0 interface address, and leftnexthop to my router address, saved then restarted ipsec service. I generated a Myserver.crt file using tinyca from the existing ssl keys and sent it to my phone and was able to import it.p  pWhere Im confused is when I try to set up an L2TP PSK vpn in my phone, it is asking for username. It also has a setting when you set up the connection that asks for IPSec preshared key  Im assuming this is the name I gave the .crt settings when I imported themp  pAny other tipssuggestions would be greatly appreciated like where to look in log files to see what might be failing and why both on the phone and on the serverp  pThanks in advance for any tipsp

I cant think of a clean solution for this problem, except you do something like thisp  precodeGET itemsidltidgt GET itemsslugltsluggt codepre  pThis would work fine, however this is not the only place I want to    identify items by either a slug or an ID and it would soon get very    ugly when one wants to implement the same approach for the other actions. Its just not very extendable, which leads us to this approachp  precodeGET itemsidltidgt GET itemsslugltsluggt codepre  pThis seems to be a good solution, but I dont know if it is what one would expect and thus it could lead to frustrating errors due to incorrect use. Also, its not so easy  or lets say clean  to implement the routing for this one. However, it would be easily extendable and would look very similar to the strongmethod for getting multiple itemsstrongp  precodeGET itemsidsltid1gt,ltid2gt,ltid3gt GET itemsslugsltslug1gt,ltslug2gt,ltslug3gt codepre  pBut this has also a downside What if someone wants to identify some of the items he want to fetch with IDs, but the others with a slug Mixing these identifiers wouldnt be easy to achieve with this.p  pWhat is the best and most widelyaccepted solution for these strongproblemsstrong In general, what matters while designing such an APIp

Negative 1581 pIve got a table that records information about customer contacts.

I would like to delete all items older than 3 weeks. So far I have thought of 2 ways to accomplish cleanup.p  p1 have a background database job run periodically e.g. every 5 hours that will scan the above table and delete anything older than 3 weeks.p  p2 In the insert stored procedure call, add the logic to clear out old data. This should only add constant time overhead since the table is indexed on [created] and each item is inserted once and deleted only once. So on average this sproc will do 1 insert and 1 delete.p  precode insert insert into recentcontacts contacttext, created values text, createDate  declare threeWeeksAgo datetime set threeWeeksAgo  DATEADDDAY, 21, GETDATE   remove old items delete from recentcontacts  where created lt threeWeeksAgo codepre  pOf the two options, I went with option 2 because I felt it was a more elegant solution and wouldnt require a separate cleanup job. My coworker told me that this was bad practice and that retention policy should always be in a separate job that runs periodically. I.e. he thought option 1 was the better option.p  pIm wondering what other people think Generally speaking, what are the best practices for enforcing data retention policies p

The issue is that when a user goes to say http sitelogin instead of https sitelogin they get a 404 error due to the schemes not recognising the route.  p  pexample main.pyp  precode  Libraries import webapp2    Local Controllers from controllers.HomeHandler import HomeHandler from controllers.LoginHandler import LoginHandler  app  webapp2.WSGIApplication[     webapp2.Router, HomeHandler,     webapp2.Routerlogin, LoginHandler, schemes[https], namelogin ], debugTrue codepre  pI have added another route  controller below the https route to catch http requestsbr codewebapp2.Routerlogin, RouteLogincode  p  pRouteLogin.pyp  precode  Libraries import webapp2  class RouteLoginwebapp2.RequestHandler     def getself         self.redirecthttpssite.appspot.comlogin codepre  pThis works, but it seems there should be a better way to do this.  Like using htaccess on Apache web server.  This is too much like a hack for my liking.  I really dont like hard coded URLs in my code.  Not to mention that it is 2 requests which for login isnt a big deal, but there could be other examples where it ends up costing too much.p  pNOTE 1  If you are looking at this solution be aware that using the HTTPS schemes also means that you will be unable to use the dev console without deleting the SCHEME or configuring a variable that you set for dev.p  pNOTE 2  I was able to get a programatic way to serve HTTPS instead of HTTP.  I was on the right track with the comment below but it needs an argument.p  pcodewebapp2.uriforlogin, schemehttpscodebr This will give you the correct a hrefhttpssomeapp.appspot.comlogin relnofollowhttpssomeapp.appspot.comlogina url.

Negative 1581 pIm currently attempting to use the OAuth 2.0 UserAgent Flow with a clientside C application, and Im running into some confusion relating to the redirect URI.p  pBecause Im working with a clientside application, I cannot supply a standard redirect URL to a web server. However, according to the people Im trying to authenticate with Salesforce, in this instance, the UserAgent Flow is the correct one to use for a clientside application.p  pMy question is, what can I do to catch the access token in this situation Apparently I can create a local resource accessible to the client, but Im unfamiliar with the mechanics behind this, and I cant find any resources on the topic partly because I dont know what to look for.p  pAny pointers as to where I should start looking would be greatly appreciated.p  hr  pEdit Some more digging has revealed the following stackoverflow question p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions670398howdoidevelopagainstoauthlocallyHow do I develop against OAuth locallyap  pIm doing some more investigating with what they suggested, but any other suggestions would be great as well.p  hr  pEdit Some more searching revealed this articlep  pa hrefhttpsarangasl.blogspot.com201009createsimplewebserviceinvisual.htmlhttpsarangasl.blogspot.com201009createsimplewebserviceinvisual.htmlap  pStill feels like Im poking around in the dark without an understanding of the larger picture, but I believe I need to set up a local web service using localhost and point my redirect URI there. Ill then use my web service to unwrap the response from the OAuth server and have my application respond appropriately. More updates to come.p  hr  pOoookay. So from what Ive been able to gather, I need to set up a local web service to supply as the callback for OAuth. I need to listen on said web service myself and catch the callback to pass it to my app. However, the default ASP.NET web service provided by VS2010 does not support URL parameters, just API calls, so I apparently need to use the WCF Rest starter kit instead.p  pI am completely foreign to all of this, so any tips would be a godsend at this point. In general, Im thinking I set up a local WCF Rest service, supply that local URI to OAuth as the callback, and then catch the callback URL using the Rest service. Then I parse the URL and extract the access token. At this point, does my app request the access token, or can my web service give the token to my app I.e., where should the locus of control bep

User can add and remove those elements freely, from whichever part of the document.

Negative 1581 pI have been running into this problem sometimes when programming.p  pImagine I have a table of data with two columns. The first column has strings, the second column has integers.p  pI want to be able to store each row of the table into a dynamic array. So each element of the array needs to hold a string and an integer.p  pPreviously, I have been accomplishing this by just splitting each column of the table into two separate ArrayLists and then when I want to add a row, I would call the add method once on each ArrayList. To remove, I would call the removeindex method once on each ArrayList at the same index.p  pBut isnt there a better way I know there are classes like HashMap but they dont allow duplicate keys. I am looking for something that allows duplicate entries.p  pI know that its possible to do something like thisp  precodeArrayListltObject[]gt myArray  new ArrayListltObject[]gt myArray.addnew Object[]string, 123 codepre  pI dont really want to have to cast into String and Integer every time I get an element out of the array but maybe this is the only way without creating my own This looks more confusing to me and Id prefer using two ArrayLists.p  pSo is there any Java object like ArrayList where it would work like thisp  precodeArrayListltString, Integergt myArray  new ArrayListltString, Integergt myArray.addstring, 123 codepre

Negative 1581 pI need to have a large list of data that when referenced at a specific location calculates loads from a file, andor generates it if it hasnt been generated yet and keeps it for future use. This is powered by lazy lists bound to a function. These chunks sometimes are loaded but never really used after that while still effectively referenced in code so the GC doesnt pick up on them.p  pSince the RAM quickly fills up, Id like to lazily unload these chunks after a period of time where they arent used by anything. Is this possiblep

Negative 1581 pSo, I have a donation table. It stores a  value and a column box where they choose monetary or in kind donation. inkind donations can have a  but usually they dont.

Negative 1581 pI am asked to implement a stack using a linked list. The program declares two stacks and uses them in order to sort some integers stored inside a file. I have the following program that crashed at the beginning. I think the it crashes in the first while of the else.  for the file, the user enters its name p  precode              Input File A text file named Numbers.txt that contains integers in random order. These integers are seperated                 by either a space or a new line. This file is very essencial for the program to work, because from it the                 program gets the integers. below is an example of the file format Note that there is a new line after                  the last integer in order for the file to be read correctly.                   2  1  3  5  4                   7  6  8  9      Output File None     Description This program reads integers in random order. These integers are sorted by the end of the programs execution.                   The sorting operations, using Push and Pop functions are managed by two structures of type stackt.                   The first structure is the main one that will be shown to the user, the second one is the one that holds the                  unsorted integers while sorting.

However, I have two problemsp  ul liOne of the classes I pass in codeHITWorkercode is already instantiated. I couldnt see how to move this to a codeProvidercode without significantly complicating my code. It is also persistent, but not to the Guicedefined session or request scope, so I am managing it myself for now. Maybe if the other issues are overcome I can try to put this in a provider.li liMore importantly, I need a reference to the other injected classes so I can do appropriate things to them. When Guice injects them, I cant access them because the bean class is arbitrary.li ul  pHeres some really bad code for what I basically need to do, which I am sure is violating all the proper dependency injection concepts. Note that codehitwcode is the only instance that I need to pass in, but Im creating the other dependent objects as well because I need references to them. With this code, Im basically only using Guice for its reflection code, not its dependency resolution.p  precodeprivate void initExperimentfinal HITWorkerImpl hitw, final String expId               final ExperimentLogImpl log  new ExperimentLogImpl     final ExperimentControllerImpl cont  new ExperimentControllerImpllog, expManager       Create an experiment instance with specific binding to this HITWorker     Injector child  injector.createChildInjectornew AbstractModule          Override         protected void configure              bindHITWorker.class.toInstancehitw             bindExperimentLog.class.toInstancelog             bindExperimentController.class.toInstancecont                                    Object experimentBean  child.getInstanceexpClass              expManager.processExperimentexpId, experimentBean       Initialize controller, which also initializes the log     cont.initializeexpId      expManager.triggerStartexpId      tracker.newExperimentStartedexpId, hitw, cont.getStartTime  codepre  pAm I screwed and just have to write my own injection code, or is there a way to do this properly Also, should I just forget about constructor injection for these bean classes, since I dont know what they contain exactly anyway Is there any way to get the dependencies if I am asking Guice to inject the bean instead of doing it myselfp  pFor context, Ive been reading the Guice docs and looking at examples for several days about this, to no avail.

This one in particular returns values like module 2 inlet temperature module 2 outlet temperature module 2 asic4 temperature module 3 inlet temperature module 3 outlet temperature module 4 inlet temperature module 4 outlet temperature ... and so on These values are all presented in a single array.  What Im trying to do is match the first 2 wordsvalues in the string in order to create groups of array key values to be used to generate RRD graphs with... the RRD part I dont need any help with, but the matching and output I do.p  pI should also note that there may be different array values in here as well depending on the device the data is coming from i.e. it might show up as Switch 1 Sensor 1 Temperature and while Im not worried about that for the moment, I will be using this script to evaluate those values in the future to create their own respective graphs.p  pSo, down to business, my thought was to create two arrays from the original use pregmatch initially to look for .emoutlet.em.emasic.em as these are hot temps, then further refine by breaking that new array down to either just the second value int or first two values module  for later comparisonp  puse pregmatch secondly to look for .eminlet.em as these are cold temps, then further refine by breaking that new array down same as the former.p  pShould now have two arrays with either key or keymodule  then use arrayintersect to look for matches across the two arrays and output the keys so I can use them to generate the graphs.p  pDoes that make sense  In other words, I only want matching module  entries to be selected to use in my graphing. i.e. module 2 inlet, module 2 outlet, module 2 asic... then repeat for  module 3 inlet, module 3 outlet, etc...p  pThis is what Ive tried and it hasnt worked the way I wanted at allp  precodetest  arraymodule 1 inlet temperature, module 2 inlet temperature, module 2 asic4 temperature, module 2 outlet temperature, module 1 outlet temperature results  array foreachtest as key gt value     pregmatch.inlet..asic., test[key]    pregmatchmodule [09][09], test[key]          results[]  value      ifpregmatch.outlet., test[key]    foreachtest as key1 gt value1        pregmatchmodule [09][09], test[key1]    results1[]  value1      results3  arrayintersectresults, results1 codepre  pAny help here would be really appreciated.

Negative 1581 pI made a Visual Studio 2012 Professional project that behaves unexpectedly. When I have just one dialog, no focus rectangles appear dotted border on controls when I use them, except after I first press TAB or ALT. When I tried to load another dialog prior to the primary one as a splash screen, the focus dotted borders strongdostrong appear on the main second dialog, they are already shown on the first item when the window loads. Why is this so and how do I prevent this from happeningp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfWfXm.png altenter image description herep  pMy only guess is that pressing ENTER or ESC causes the same kind of behavior as pressing TAB or ALT, and I always see the effects because the user has to press ENTER or ESC to close the splash screen.

I can easily set the focus to a control, but not just remove it in general.p  pFor those interested in sample codep  hr  pI could show the my entire projects code but itd be easier to test it yourself honestly.

Only one of these columns may contain a value for any given row, all others are null. Allows for strict foreign keys, but it gets tedious when the number of many possible referenced tables gets largeli liHave a two column relationship, i.e. one column describing which table is referenced, and one referencing the instance row in that table. Easily extended when the number of many referenced tables grows, though I cant perform single query lookup in a straightforward way either left join all possible tables, or union multiple queries which joins towards one table eachli lili ol  pMake sense Whats best practise if any in this case I specifically want to be able to query data from the referenced entity, without really knowing which of the tables are being referenced.p  pHow would you dop

Negative 1581 p.Netwise, Ive been stuck in 2005 until just recently. I know I have a lot of catching up to do but since I dont like inefficient code, the following code snippet at the bottom of this question from the SimpleInjector tutorial has me a bit stumped.p  pThe problem is within the codeBootStrappercode method, which is used to intialize a static SimpleInjector container.  p  pWithin this method, a codevar containercode is declared and assigned a new codeContainercode.  At the end of the method, the methodscope codecontainercode is then assigned to the static, App level codecontainercode variable.p  pWhy is this done this way  There must be a good reason for assigning the container first to a localscope var and then, finally, assigning the var to the classlevel, static Container variable.  To me, this seems like an obvious, redundant assignment, but if thats the case, I doubt anyone would do it this way.  What am I missingp  pThe code, below, is from the code from the SimpleInjector documentation.

Negative 1581 pI decided to translate the C official grammar to strongantlr v4strong. However, while testing I encountered the following problem. The given grammar doesnt match simple words like codenntruennltEOFgtcode. It keeps saying codemismatched input nntruenn expecting Literal code. Even after I leave the definition of codeLiteralcode as codeLiteral BooleanLiteralcode the input codenntruennltEOFgtcode still doesnt get matched.

Negative 1581 pIm currently working on a web app that uses Backbone for rendering templates based on model data pulled down from a server.

My templates depend heavily on model data, so Id like to know if theres a clean or standard way to untangle the model dependent and independent portions of the templates code to minimize a choppy user experience One thought I had was to load the model independent portions of the template first, followed by the model dependent ones, but that seems inefficient. p  precodemodel  new Model   Create model model.fetch.done gt   Load model data from server   view  .template ViewTemplate,   Fill template w model data     model model   view.html view   Update DOM w newly rendered template  codepre

Negative 1581 pI have an 802.3 wired transmitter application on my computer that Ive written to broadcast UDP packets every 10ms.

Negative 1581 pI have a numerical problem while doing likelihood ratio tests in python. Ill not go into too much detail about what the statistics mean, my problems comes down to calculating this p  precodeLR  LRH0  LRh1  codepre  pwhere codeLRcode is the number of interest and codeLRH0code and codeLRH1code are numbers that can be emVERYem close to zero. This leads to a few numerical issues if codeLRH1code is too small then python will recognise this as a division by zero. p  precodeZeroDivisionError float division by zero codepre  pAlso, although this is not the main issue, if codeLRH1code is small enough to allow the division then the fraction codeLRH0  LRh1code might become too big Im assuming that python also has an upper limit value of what a float can be. p  pAny tips on what the best way is to circumvent this problem Im considering doing something like p  precodedef smallenough num       if num  0.0          return other small number      else      return num  codepre  pBut this is not ideal because it would approximate the codeLRcode value and I would like to guarantee some precision.  p

Am i understanding this right so far Out of curiosity i commented that copyconstructor and it gave as i expected a compiler error on every little gem conversion from A to nonscalar type A requested. p  pGiven it is compiled with a GCC 4.1.2 is there any mechanism involved i dont know that makes this actually usefull In my opinion its just really bad practice Not only is it slow but also leaks memory alot, isnt itp  h2Edith2  pI change to array of double because the ppl where commenting to much about that memcpy feature which is actually okay, because its actually an boostsharedarray i just simplified for example purpose.p

Negative 1581 pI need to let users add more text fields to my JFrame so once the size of the frame has exceeded its original value a scroll pane would step in. Since I cannot add JScrollPane to JFrame in order to enable scrolling I decided to put the JPanel on the JFrame and pass the  JPanel object into the JScrollPane constructor. Scrolling now works fine but only until it has reached the borders of the JPanel. The thing is the size of JPanel stays as is and is not stretching dynamically. What happens is the buttons in my code are using up all the space of the JPanel being the size of 300x300 but what I want to do is have JPanel stretch once these controls have used up its original space.

Negative 1581 pIm trying to set up an xml layout to be used for a row in a codeListViewcode.

Negative 1581 pI have a Spring Web flow application running on Weblogic 10. In current application, on load of the Page A , we are making an ajax call , which in the back end makes a webservice call WEBSVCA. On the submission of the same page,we have another webservice call being made WEBSVCB. The application requires that WEBSVCA call should always be made and completed before WEBSVCB call starts. But sometimes, when the user submits the page very fast, WEBSVCA response has not comeback yet and the call to WEBSVCB fails because of the concurrent call.p  pIn order to resolve the above problem, I was planning to implement BlockingQueue for the webservice call status. In this case, the response from the WEBSVCA can be used as Producer and before the call to WEBSVCB is made we can check the queue as consumer.p  pstrongIs is this the best approach or there could be a simpler approach than thisstrongp  pPlease let me know if you need any other details.p

Negative 1581 pI have to send bunch of information to a third party company. This also inludes a url. This url when received by them is then used to send information back to that url in http post. I have written a controller controller1 and a method method1 with no return parm. The url I send is codehttpsomeurl8080controller1method1.code I am now expecting that when the post is made by them I will get the required information to the url. But as I see it I do not get the control back. In my method method1 I am trying to get the raw url codestring url  System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsoluteUricode but I dont see the control coming to that method.

Negative 1581 pJust a caveat, this is my first ever question, be gentle with me.p  pI had a UITableViewController that conforms to the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate protocol.  This all works perfectly.  I want to change that to a UIViewController to be able to add more to the view than just the tableview.  I created the tableView property and set the delegate and datasource.  Everything works fine except that the FRC delegate methods are not called and the table is not updated.  The inserts, edits, and deletes are being stored to the database, but the table is not updating when I change something in the context.  p  pAll the code is the basic template code for using a fetched results controller.  When it sets the delegate in the linep  precodeaFetchedResultsController.delegate  self codepre  pIt should be setting the delegate correctly, but it is not.  Again, the only change I make is to remove the word Table from UITableViewController.  It works with the UITableViewController but not the UIViewController.  I have researched this extensively but have not found an answer.p  pThanks.p  pHeres some codep  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ltCoreDataCoreData.hgt . . .  class NowWhatDetailViewController class Event  interface NowWhatMasterViewController  UITableViewController ltNSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate, ChangeDateViewControllerDelgate, EditEventViewControllerDelgate, PasswordViewControllerDelegate,     UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSourcegt       NSMutableArray saveButtonItems      IBOutlet UILabel nextEventLabel     IBOutlet UILabel timeToNextEventLabel      property strong, nonatomic NowWhatDetailViewController detailViewController property strong, nonatomic NSFetchedResultsController fetchedResultsController property strong, nonatomic NSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext  property nonatomic, weak id ltChangeDateViewControllerDelgategt delegate  property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UITableView tableView . . .  end   And the important sections of NowWhatMasterViewController.m   import NowWhatMasterViewController.h   interface NowWhatMasterViewController       end  implementation NowWhatMasterViewController       Event lastEditedEvent      voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]       [self performFetch]      [[self.splitViewController.viewControllers lastObject] topViewController]      self.detailViewController.viewNSDate  self.viewNSDate     self.detailViewController.viewDate  self.viewDate     self.detailViewController.viewSchedule  self.viewSchedule     self.detailViewController.managedObjectContext  self.managedObjectContext     self.detailViewController.fetchedResultsControllerDetail  self.fetchedResultsController      [self.detailViewController updateDetailView]        show the bottom toolbar     [self.navigationController setToolbarHiddenNO]      saveButtonItems  [self.toolbarItems mutableCopy]      nextEventLabel.text  next event     timeToNextEventLabel.text  starts in  minutes       voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.     self.fetchedResultsController  nil     voidviewDidUnload      self.fetchedResultsController  nil   pragma mark  Table View    NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView      return [dayEvents count]     voidtableViewUITableView tableView accessoryButtonTappedForRowWithIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       Event event  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]      [self performSegueWithIdentifierEditEvent senderevent]     NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection      id ltNSFetchedResultsSectionInfogt sectionInfo  [self.fetchedResultsController sections][section]     return [sectionInfo numberOfObjects]     return [dayEvents count]    UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierEventCell]     [self configureCellcell atIndexPathindexPath]     return cell    BOOLtableViewUITableView tableView canEditRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       Return NO if you do not want the specified item to be editable.      if isLocked          return NO      else          return YES         voidtableViewUITableView tableView commitEditingStyleUITableViewCellEditingStyleeditingStyle forRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if editingStyle  UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete          NSManagedObjectContext context  [self.fetchedResultsController managedObjectContext]         [context deleteObject[self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]]          NSError error  nil         if [context saveamperror]                Replace this implementation with code to handle the error appropriately.               abort causes the application to generate a crash log and terminate.

Negative 1581 pIm decompiling a dll into C. One of the decompiler generated project contains 1000 buggy lines which one like belowp  precodethis.pictureBox1.BeginInit codepre  blockquote   pError 385 System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox does not contain a   definition for BeginInit and no extension method BeginInit   accepting a first argument of type System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox   could be found are you missing a using directive or an assembly   referencep blockquote  pThere is no BeginInit method for regular Picturebox. I simply commented out the linesp  precodethis.pictureBox1.BeginInit codepre  pThen Ive examined another decompilers output, it looks like below and VS compiler hasnt previous errorp  precodeISupportInitializethis.pictureBox1.BeginInit codepre  pBecause of a crash, I couldnt export all sources at once with the second decompiler. Now Im not sure what I have to do. I couldnt run amp debug the project because of other errors need to be cleared first. My options arep  ol liJust comment out the lines.li liModify and insert ISupportInitialize tag.li liCreate an extension method if possible.li ol  pLast option seems easiest to me. Can I create BeginInit extension method, will it work without any problem And how can I implement amp use ISupportInitializep

Negative 1581 pI have an array of three ints and an array of three strings. p  pI want to be able to find the lowest int in the array and replace it if the next value is higher. If the lowest int is replaced I want to replace the corresponding string. p  precodeint [] counts  matchA, matchB, matchC String [] names  nameA, nameB, nameC codepre  pFor example say matchA is 6, matchB is 4, and matchC is 10 and nameA is bob, nameB is Fred, and nameC is jake. p  pThe names correspond to the ints in their respective positions. p  pIf for a new user there count is 15, I want to replace matchB, because it is the lowest and replace nameB because it is the corresponding name. p  pHow would I code this p  pThanksp

Negative 1581 pI have an abstract interface in ObjectiveC where every subclass needs to set up a property and then do the exact same thing with that property at the end of codeinitcode. Im trying to avoid duplicated code with something like thisp  pstrongInterface Filestrongp  precodeinterface Shape  NSObject  property nonatomic PropertyType prop   idinit  voidinitProperty  end codepre  pstrongImplementation Filestrongp  precodeimplementation Shape   idinit      ifself  [super init]          [self initProperty]         [prop doSomething]          return self    voidinitProperty    end codepre  pMy problem is that every subclass will need a different set of parameters passed to codeinitPropertycode in order to implement the method correctlyp  precodeimplementation Rectangle   voidinitPropertyWithRectCGRectrect      prop  [RectangleStuff rectangleWithRectrect]   end  implementation Circle   voidinitPropertyWithRadiusCGFloatradius      prop  [CircleStuff circleWithRadiusradius]   end codepre  pIs there a clean way to do what Im trying to do in ObjectiveC So far, my options seem to bep  ol liCreate a property bag, and just pass around an codeNSDictionarycode.li liDuplicate the code[property doSomething]code code in every subclass.li liSomehow pass in a factory object to init, and have the factory object create codepropcode. This approach seems the cleanest, but Id need the factory object to keep the rect andor radius as internal state somehow, and that doesnt seem clean to me.li ol  pAny thoughtsp
Negative 1581 pIs there any easy way of making able to select from DBGrid just like selecting range in excell filep

Negative 1581 pI am having issues with the little bit of white space between the image and the menu.  The only way i can get rid of it is by using negative margins.  However since Im using a Strict DTD that is required, negative margins are not an option.  Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong  This whole thing started with an incompatibility issue with codeIE8code and that is why I had to change the codedoctypecode to codestrictcode.

Negative 1581 pIm currently working on a GPGPU project that uses OpenGL ES 2.0. I have a rendering pipeline that uses framebuffer objects FBOs as targets, i.e. the result of each rendering pass is saved in a texture which is attached to an FBO. So far, this works when using fragment shaders. For example I have to following rendering pipelinep  precodePreprocessing downscaling, grayscale conversion gt Adaptive Thresholding Pass 1  gt Adapt. Thresh. Pass 2 gt Copy back to CPU codepre  pHowever, I wanted to extend this pipeline by adding a grayscale histogram calculation after the proprocessing step. With OpenGL ES 2.0 this only works with texture reads in the vertex shader, as far as I know [1]. I can confirm that my shaders work in a different program where the input is a real image, not a rendered texture that is attached to an FBO. Hence I think it is not possible to read texture data in a vertex shader if it comes from an FBO. Can anyone confirm this assumption or am I missing something Im using a Nexus 10 for my experiments.p  p[1] It basically works by reading each pixel value from the texture in the vertex shader, then calculating of the histogram bin from it and adding it in the fragment shader by using alpha blending.p

Negative 1581 pI am hoping this title represents this question well.  I am attempting to build a dynamic query based on multiple vars existing.  I am attempting to make this work using a simple ififelseelse block but cant seem to get it to work correctly.  The first if statements execute accordingly but the third fails.  I am new to PHP so I am assuming this a beginner mistake.  I also believe there is most likely a far more eloquent way to achieve the desired results.  p  pBasically the user enters a few inputs into multiple text fields.  Only one field, out of the 3 needs to contain a value, but 2 or all 3 can as well.  If the value does not exist in a field it should generate a Query based on the values provided.

Negative 1581 pSo I have been coding for a few months now, and I think I am getting the hang of working with MySQL. I can CRUD fairly well now. However, there is one pretty fundamental concept thats eluding me and I cant seem to figure out the best solution. The concept is basically centered around what the best practice is when one has to grab data from different tables  when not all data has joins on other related tables.p  pFor example, lets say my task is to get all products and images from two separate tables, one called strongproductsstrong, and the other called strongimagesstrong. While all images have an associated product, emnot all products have imagesem. p  pI started out writing my queryp  precodeSELECT productname, productId FROM products codepre  pTo first grab the pertinent product information. This is where I am stumped. What would be the best way to get the images for the products that actually have images I cannot just join the image table as suchp  precodeSELECT productname, image FROM products, images         WHERE images.imageproductId  products.productId codepre  pbecause that would not pull back any product that does not have a join on the image table.p  pRight now, my solution is to run the first query, pull back the results, and then while I iterate through the product data row by row, I run an image subquery that readsp  precodeSELECT image FROM images WHERE images.imageproductId  productId codepre  pwhere the variable productId is that rows particular productId. If the query gives me results, I add the image data to the row.p  pThis to me feels like terrible programming practice. Intuitively, I think that it can and should all be done in one query  but I cannot seem to figure out what that query would be.  p  pI hope I was clear in how I worded this  and yes, I realize that to many this will be a very basic question. Could someone point me in the right direction Thank you very much in advancep

If I try to make the call to my service and return all records, I get the following error headers in Fiddlerp  precodeHTTP1.1 504 Fiddler  Receive Failure Date Tue, 29 Jul 2014 131618 GMT ContentType texthtml charsetUTF8 Connection close CacheControl nocache, mustrevalidate codepre  pHowever, if I switch my Stored Procedure in SQL to only return codeTOP 10000code, everything works fine and my data comes through perfectly.p  pAs stated earlier, it doesnt appear to be the size of the returned object by scaling up from the amount of data that codeTOP 10000code returns, my full result set would be around 1.41.5 MB, and I have my codeweb.configcode file set up to allow a max JSON size of much much more than thatp  precodeltsystem.web.extensionsgt   ltscriptinggt     ltwebServicesgt       ltjsonSerialization maxJsonLengthwellOver10GB gt     ... codepre  pHas anyone else run into this problem of too many objects and found a solution Is there a way to increase this limit, or is my problem possibly unrelated to this limit and actually something else Im not seeingp

Negative 1581 pSome utility classes think codejava.lang.Mathcode declares only a private constructor in order to prevent instantiation of the class.p  pIs there any particular reason for why such classes are not implemented in terms of a 0instance enum It seems to me like enums is a more direct way of controlling instantiation than access modifiers on constructors. It also prevents the class itself from creating instances which both prevent the programmer from shooting himself in the foot and convey a guarantee outwards of no instances.p  pJoshua Bloch advocates the use of enums for singletons. Shouldnt the same benefits apply to 0instance utility classesp  pstrongMy questionstrong What are the proscons of 0instance enums vs private constructors. I personally see no drawbacks of using an enum, though private constructors seems to be the more prevalent approach.p  psupI know codejava.lang.Mathcode predates codeenumcode.

Negative 1581 pI am developing a java application using SWT which has an embedded browser.I need to navigate back and forth as in a regular browser.I know there are browser.back  and browser.forward functions.But the problem is i am not setting the content of the browser using URLs,instead i am constructing a string and setting it to browser using browser.setText .

The four characters represent a 16bit binary count which is the 2s complemented sum of the 8bit binary representation of the message characters after the parity bit if enabled has been cleared. Overflows are ignored. The data integrity check can be done by converting the four checksum characters to the 16bit   binary number and adding the 8bit binary representation of the message characters to it. The binary result should be zero.p blockquote  pIve tried a few different interpretations of the specification, including ignoring SOH as well as the ampersands, and even the function code. strongAt this point I must be missing something very obvious in either my interpretation of the spec, or the code Ive been using to test.strong Below youll find a simple example data was taken from a live system, emif it were correct, the lower word in the validate variable would be 0emp  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args      unchecked              var data  String.Format01, char 1, i11A0014092414220ampamp         const string checkSum  FBEA           Checksum is 16 bit word         var checkSumValue  Convert.ToUInt16checkSum, 16           Sum of message chars preceeding checksum         var mySum  data.TakeWhilec gt c  amp.Aggregate0, current, c gt current  c         var validate  checkSumValue  mySum          Console.WriteLineData 0, data         Console.WriteLineChecksum 0X4, checkSumValue         Console.WriteLineSum of chars 0X4, mySum         Console.WriteLineValidation 0, Convert.ToStringvalidate, 2         Console.ReadKey       codepre  h1Edith1  pWhile the solution provided by tinstaafl works for this particular example, it doesnt work when providing a larger record such as the belowp  blockquote   pSOHi20100140924165011000007460904004608B40045361000427DDD6300000000427C3C66000000002200000745B4100045B3D8004508C00042754B900000000042774D8D0000000033000007453240004531E000459F5000420EA4E100000000427B14BB000000005500000744E0200044DF4000454AE000421318A0000000004288A998000000006600000744E8C00044E7200045469000421753E600000000428B4DA50000000ampampp blockquote  precodeBA6C codepre  pTheoretically you could keep incrementingdecrementing a value in the string until the checksum matched, it just so happened that using the character 1 rather than the ASCII SOH control character gave it just the right value, a coincidence in this case.p

Negative 1581 pOur web application has a button that is supposed to send data to a server on the local network that in turn prints something on a printer.p  pSo far it was easy The button triggered an AJAX POST request to codehttpprinterserverprint.phpcode with a token, that page connected to the web application to verify the token and get the data to print and then printed.p  pHowever, we are now delivering our web application via HTTPs and I would rather not go back to HTTP for this and newer versions of Chrome and Firefox dont make the request to the HTTP address anymore, they dont even send the request to check CORS headers.p  pNow, what is a modern alternative to the crossprotocol XHR Do Websockets suffer from the same problem A Google search did not make clear what is the current state here. Can I use TCP Sockets already I would rather not switch to GET requests either, because the action is not idempotent and it might have practical implications with preloading and caching.p  pI can change the application on the printerserver in any way so I could replace it with NodeJS or something but I cannot change the users browsers to trust a selfsigned certificate for emprinterserverem for example.p

Negative 1581 pI have an android client which has to communicate through socket to a c based pc server. The question is, if the pc server is behind a router which somwhow does not seem to support port forwarding through upnp, or even through configuration, it simply cant get connection.   These routers are some kind of free wifi zones prepared for free by some kind of companies, so I cant have any access to its configs. The upnp or configuring my router both works fine, but I dont really know what to do about these routers.p

Negative 1581 pIm doing a website as a way to venture into web development.p  pI am trying to make a website that is basically a bunch of rows of horizontal bars, each one being a section or a page. As you scroll, one bar expands to take up part of the window not the entire window to leave room for the bars that havent expanded. So you view one full section at a time with the other sections still visible at the top and bottom as bars, and you scroll to navigate through each section. The idea is for each section to stretch to full proportions, and when the user moves to the next section, its content becomes squished into a little bar again.p  pDoes anyone have any advice to help me move forward with thisp

Negative 1581 pWhen I create a regular package in Python I get an object with codepathcode method which is considered a special type of module according to Python documentation. My question is why in codepack.pathcode list only the first item is searched and the others are omitted and why its a list rather than a normal string since the other items arent scanned  p  pExample  Suppose we have a directory names Ccode which contains a package name pkg. and another path which contains spam.py p  precode    C      pkg                Regular package          .init.py      another           spam.py  printspam           codepre  h1 h1  precodegtgtgt import pkg  gtgtgt pkg.path    Only path[0] searched    [Ccodepkg]      gtgtgt pkg.path.appendrCanother  gtgtgt pkg.path     [Ccodepkg, Canother]    path[1] omitted  gtgtgt import pkg.spam                   Fails     ImportError...   gtgtgt pkg.path.pop0               Works gtgtgt pkg.spam     spam codepre  pSo Im wondering why Python only traverses codepath[0]code rather than the whole list as it does in 3.X for namespace packages It doesnt make sense to have codepathcode as list if its not traversed fully. I know regular packages are different from namespace packages, but why bother having a list here and allowing only singe search path However, Python 3.3 traverses the whole list which in some forms it emulates the behavior of namespace packages by adding directories in codepathcode attribute for a regular package. p

This will give me the order in which samples were processed by a downstream function.

Negative 1581 pOn our TFS server, we have a trunk that is used for daytoday development.  Nine months ago, I made a feature branch for what has become a fairly large refactoring of the code.  While I have been working on my branch, the other developer has been working directly on the trunk and building releases from there.  Yes, I know this is bad practice.  This means I cant merge my branch back into the trunk until its been heavily tested, as new production builds are made from the trunk almost daily.  Again, yes, I know this is bad practice.p  pIn order for other employees to test my branch before reintegration, I need a version with the last nine months of incremental updates from the trunk.  What I would like to do is merge the last nine months of changes from the trunk into my branch and then, after testing, merge my branch into the trunk.  Is this a common scenario  Is it possible with TFS  If so, what terminology should I use to search for tutorials, etc  Or, if it can be described succinctly here, what are the stepsp

Negative 1581 pI have integrated fullcalendar with codeigniter framework. Pulling events from my MySQL database works fine, as does rescheduling events using eventDrop. My issue is that all events are displayed twice in my calendar. Moreover, the dates in the calendar are shifted to match the duration of the first instance of the event. How can I get rid of the second display I suspect that it has something to do with the css, or the codeigniter framework, but I cant pinpoint where or how.p  pI have ruled out issues related with the database.

Negative 1581 pIm trying to update a website to support modal windows now so they will work now that the window.showModalDialog is losing all support.p  pTo do this i have tried to use the jQuery UI function dialog with an iFrame in it. Using a function i found somewhere as a startingpoint i managed to get it so i only have to change one thing in all the modals used in the site, but what Im looking for is a way to not change anything in the modals. This because there are a lot of them and they use functions that use other functions that use showModalDialog and so on.p  pTo do this i need to be able to close the dialog with window.close, because thats how the old modals where closed. I managed to get it working with FF by overriding the window.close function but the problem is that I also need it to also work in IE, and in IE you cant override the function.p  pSo if anyone could help me i would be most grateful.p

Negative 1581 pI have a Django application for a website that were trying to post to Facebook. Most of the time after a new page is created and we try to post it, Facebook will either hang or come back with blank information for the page. The pages that were trying to post have OG tags so it should be able to process it, but it doesnt. p  pIve tried adding some code to force Graph to precache the page before we try to post it. The response I get back is a 500 error or a message saying the ogtype property is missing, and the debugger shows Response Code NA and The ogtype property is required, but not present  even though the property exists.p  pIf I force the debugger to fetch new scrape information it will and it will report the correct tags and the image for the page. At that point were able to post the page properly. However that doesnt always work either, sometimes itll come back and say it cant find the tags but then if I fetch it again itll get the tags.

Negative 1581 pIve recently started developing a simple webpage with a submit form on it. Initially, I approached it using HTML, CSS and a jQuery bootstrap to animate my elements timepickers, datepickers, dropdowns and file uploaders. Then I realised that I wanted to make my form a multistep form using Angular.br Everything went well, and I managed to follow a tutorial to change my form and inject different views into it by using an Angular app. However, none of the Javascripts that are loaded into my index page are working any more since they get loaded on DOM ready, before the Angular.br I read up on different ways to get around this by creating Angular directives to emulate jQuery elements.br I was wondering what the correct approach to solving this is. It seems quite often people suggest not using a mixture of jQuery and Angular. Is there any way to load the javascripts after Angular has finished putting everything in or is this bad practice and should be avoidedp

Negative 1581 pI would like to ask you a question about the concurrent kernel execution in Nvidia GPUs. I explain us my situation. I have an code which launchs 1 sparse matrix multiplication for 2 different matrix one for each one. These matrix multiplications are performed with the cuSPARSE Library. I want both operations can be concurrently performed, so I use 2 streams to launch them. With Nvidia Visual profiler, Ive observed that both operations cuSPARSE kernels are completely overlaped. The time stamps for both kernels arep  ul liKernel 1 Start Time 206,205 ms  End Time 284,177 ms.li liKernel 2 Start Time 263,519 ms  End Time 278,916 ms.li ul  pIm using a Tesla K20c with 13 SMs which can execute up 16 blocks per SM. Both kernels have 100 occupancy and launch an enough amount of blocksp  ul liKernel 1 2277 blocks, 32 RegisterThread, 1,156 KB shared memory.li liKernel 2 46555 blocks, 32 RegisterThread, 1,266 KB shared memory.li ul  pWith this configuration, both kernels shouldnt show this behaviour, since both kernels launch an enough number of blocks to fill all SMs of the GPU. However, Nvidia Visual Profiler shows that these kernels are being overlaped. Why. Anyone could explain me why this behaviour can occurp  pMany thanks in advance.p
Negative 1581 pIt is well known or should be that binding the result of a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppalgorithmmin relnofollowcodestdmincodea to a codeconstcode reference is a very bad idea, whenever one of the arguments of codestdmincode is a rvalue, since codeconstcode reference binding is not propagated through function return.
