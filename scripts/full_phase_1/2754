Positive 2754 pI am trying to convert long numbers to a string vector in rust. Example code17562code would become code[1, 7, 5, 6, 2]code. I have seen a lot of converting ints to strings, but no ints to string vectors.p  pHere is what I have so far, but it isnt working. p  pcodelet values Vecltampstrgt  x.tostring.splitc char c.isalphabetic.collectcodep  pLater on in the code I am parsing that string back to a u8.p

Positive 2754 pActually, I want to track some statistics during a computation that takes a lot of time. Here is a reproducible example, even if it doesnt make sense for you, its easier for me to start from here since I dont want to explain my whole problem and put my whole code. So there is a computation, a while loop that generate random numbers, it is supposed to take a lot of time. During this loop, I want to track some statistics. So I want to track what is the minimum so far, what is the maximum so far, the number of iteration so fart, etc... So its easy to do it with a cat function. The problem is if I do it the regular way, for each iteration, it adds a new output. See the code p  precodei1 min99 max99 whileilt10000    xrnorm 1, 0, 2    if xltminminx   if xgtmaxmaxx   catniteration ,i   catnmin ,min   catnmax ,max   ii1  codepre  pconsole view p  precode  ...     iteration  9997     min  6.670651     max  7.082235     iteration  9998     min  6.670651     max  7.082235     iteration  9999     min  6.670651     max  7.082235 codepre  pTo address this problem, its possible to use the r separator.

I also have a fragment that has five WaveControls and I need to implement an onClickListener in the fragment to apply a filter depending on which of the WaveControls was clickedupdated. BUT even if I implement the above code I get different ids, i.e. as inp  precodeWaveControl wc1  in xml id is field1 WaveControl wc2  in xml if is field2 WaveControl wc3 ...

I have figured a workaround in just making several onClickListeners for each waveControl field, but it doesnt seem like the perfect solution. And still the problem is there  casting a ViewParent to a View will not get you the actual id of the view as laid in the fragment. Any prompts why this is happening would be appreciated. Thanksp

Positive 2754 pIm fiddling a bit with codeAnycode and casting just to get a deeper understanding of Rust. From C Im used to the fact that casting can lead to runtime exceptions because casting in C basically means emDear compiler, trust me, I know what Im doing please cast this into an codeint32code because I know it will work.emp  pHowever, if youre doing an invalid cast the program will blow up with an Exception at runtime. So I was wondering if casting in safe Rust can equally lead to a runtime exception.p  pSo, I came up with this code to try it out.p  precodeuse stdanyAny  fn main      let someint  4     let somestr  foo            let mut v  VecltampAnygtnew       v.pushampsomeint       v.pushampsomestr         this gives a None       let x  v[0].downcastrefltStringgt       printlnfoo , x        this gives Some4       let y  v[0].downcastreflti32gt       printlnfoo , y        the compiler doesnt let me do this cast which would lead to a runtime error       let z  v[1] as i32        codepre  pMy observation so far is that the compiler seems to prevent me from this kind of runtime exceptions because I have to cast through codedowncastrefcode which returns an codeOptioncode which makes it safe again. Sure, I can codeunwrapcode on a codeNonecode to blow it up but thats not my point p  pThe compiler prevents me from writing codelet z  v[1] as i32code which could lead to a runtime error. So, is it correct to assume that casting in safe Rust will never result in a runtime errorp  pI know that preventing runtime errors is exactly what Rust is all about so it makes perfect sense, I just want to validate my observation p
Negative 2754 pIm sure this has already been asked and answered so I apologize in advance for that but Im not figuring out the correct keywords to search for.  Searching for Pattern hits way too many Q amp As to be useful.p  pIm working on a regression testing app.  Im displaying a form on the screen and according to which user is logged in to the app some of the fields should be readonly.  So I can abstract a field object and I can abstract a user object but what pattern should I be looking at to describe the intersection of these two concepts  In other words how should I describe that for Field 1 and User A, the field should be readonly  It seems like readonly or not should be a property of the Field class but as I said, it depends on which user is looking at the form.  Ive considered a simple twodimensional array e. g. ReadOnly[Field,User]  True but I want to make sure Ive picked the most effective structure to represent this.    p  pAre there any software design patterns regarding this kind of data structure  Am I overcomplicating thingswould a twodimensional array be the best way to go here  As I said if this has been asked and answered, I do apologize.

I come from a ObjC background w Cocoa of course and would love to hear from the seasoned programmers about why MVC with Java is said to fall short.p  pAppreciate itp

The service receives an identity key for data in SQL Server and a path to generate and save a PDF report for this data.  p  pIn most cases, this web service returns results to the calling web pages very quickly, usually within a few seconds max.  p  pHowever, it seems to occasionally hit a significant slowdown.  The web application calling the web service will generate a timeout error when this slowdown occurs.  We have checked and the PDF does get created and saved to the server, so it looks like the web service eventually finishes executing. It seems to take about 1 to 2 minutes for processing to have completed.  The PDF is generated using ActiveReports from Data Dynamics.  p  pWwhen this problem occurs, making a small change to the web services config file ie, adding a blank space to a connection string line seems to restart the web service and everything is perfectly ok for a period of time afterwards.p  pOther web applications that are running on the same web server do not seem to experience this type of behavior, only this particular web service.  p  pI have added the code for the web service below.  It is basic calls to 3rd party libraries. We are not able to recreate this problem in test.p  pI am wondering what might be causing this issue p  precode[WebMethod] public string Publishint identity, string transactionType, string directory, string filename      try              AdpConnection Conn  new AdpConnectionConfigurationManager.AppSettings[myDBConnString]         AdpCommand Cmd  new AdpCommandstoredprocGetData, oConn         AdpParameter Param          Cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure          Param  Cmd.CreateParameterIdentity, DbType.Int32         Param.Value  identity         Cmd.Parameters.AddoParam          Conn.Open         string aResponse  Cmd.ExecuteScalar.ToString         Conn.Close          if transactionType  typeA                      Parse response             DataSet dsResponse  ParseDataResponseaResponse             dsResponse.WriteXmlConfigurationManager.AppSettings[DocsDir]  identity.ToString  .xml              DataDynamics.ActiveReports.ActiveReport3 rpt  new DataDynamics.ActiveReports.ActiveReport3              rpt.LoadLayoutConfigurationManager.AppSettings[myReportPath]  TypeA.rpx             rpt.AddNamedItemReportPath, ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[myReportPath]             rpt.AddNamedItemXMLSTRING, FormatXMLdsResponse.GetXml             DataDynamics.ActiveReports.DataSources.XMLDataSource xmlds  new DataDynamics.ActiveReports.DataSources.XMLDataSource             xmlds.FileURL  null             xmlds.RecordsetPattern  DataPatternA             xmlds.LoadXMLFormatXMLdsResponse.GetXml              if System.IO.Directory.ExistsConfigurationManager.AppSettings[DocsDir]  directory                                System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectoryConfigurationManager.AppSettings[DocsDir]  directory                             string sXML  FormatXMLdsResponse.GetXml             StreamWriter sw  new StreamWriterConfigurationManager.AppSettings[DocsDir]  directory    filename  .xml, false             sw.WritesXML             sw.Close              rpt.DataSource  xmlds             rpt.Runtrue              DataDynamics.ActiveReports.Export.Pdf.PdfExport xPdf  new DataDynamics.ActiveReports.Export.Pdf.PdfExport               xPdf.Exportrpt.Document, ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[DocsDir]  directory    filename  .pdf                     catchException ex              return Error   ex.ToString           return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[DocsDir]  directory    filename  .pdf  codepre

Negative 2754 pIm building a little game in HTML5.  The canvas element is a viewport into the game world.  The user can move the viewports position in the world by clicking and dragging with the mouse on a small icon.p  pThe problem is that the scrolling stops when the mouse pointer hits the edge of the screen.  In all likelihood, that will limit scrolling in one of the directions severely, since the icon will be in one of the corners of the page.p  pThe only technical solution I can think of would be to somehow fix the mouse pointers position on the icon and detect the relative movement each frame.  Basically I would just reset the pointer position back to the center of the icon after each drag event.  Unfortunately, Im fairly positive that this is not possible.  Playing with the users pointer is a big nono from a usability and security standpoint.p  pSo, is there any other way to do what I want  Im primarily looking for technical ideas here, but suggestions for a more appropriate interface would also be welcome.p

Negative 2754 pI have a div container inside which there are several child divs with css float left. However I only make one of these child divs visible at a time. Most of the child divs contain some input fields, radio buttons, etc. The motive to display only one of the child divs at a time was to conserve space. Now I kind of want to display all the divs in one go and not compromise on space. So I am thinking some solution to display all of these modally. I already use jqueryui stuff in my page. Basically I want to know what can be done here. I cant use the jqueryui modal dialog boxes since they have their own look and feel. Is it possible to clone the child divs and add it to another div which I programmatically create Moreover all the child divs are float left. Say there are like 6 child divs. I want it to display 3 in a row...p

Negative 2754 pI am trying to use the NavigationControllers toolbar in my app.  This toolbars toolbarItems are suppose to change depending on which view controller is presented.  this is very basic.p  pWhat I am trying to do is to add custom buttons to the toolbar using the UIBarButtonItems initWithCustomView method.  However, the button wont show up on the toolbar.  But if I create the UIBarButtonItem using the initWithTitle or initWithBarButtonSystemItem method, the button show up.

There is blank space at the place where the button is suppose to be at.  p  pIf this same code used on a regular toolbar that I create instead of NavigationControllers toolbar, the button shows up.  I am trying to just use one toolbar throughout the app to have the same feel that Apples Mail application does.  The reason that I need to use the initWithCustomView method is because one of the icons is colored and this is the only way it shows up colored on a normal toolbar.  Now, I have looked through apple documentation and there isnt any mention of why the initWithCustomView method couldnt be called or maybe I couldnt find it.  p  pCould please somebody shine some light on this topic to help me point in the right direction.  thanks in advance guys.p

Negative 2754 pI am interested in the idea of using TweetsSMSIdentica or other short text status update systems to track Observations of Daily Living or ODLs. The basic notion is that you send status updates to Twitter or Identi.ca or perhaps just an SMS message or whatever in a format that can be later mined to show patterns.p  pYou could use it to track exercise, diets, your movie preferences, anything you like. p  pTo do this you need to have a syntax that allows both humans and computers to easily parse your status updates. The syntax should be dense, which supports the low character counts, but still human readable. p  pThis idea is not new and there are lots of twitter apps out there for tracking exercise and eating habits. Twitter is already essentially a short text ODL medium, which you can easily see by looking at searched for feeling a hrefhttpsearch.twitter.comsearchq23feeling relnofollowhttpsearch.twitter.comsearchq23feelinga  or searches for hurts a hrefhttpsearch.twitter.comsearchq23hurts relnofollowhttpsearch.twitter.comsearchq23hurtsa or applications intended to mine the wealth of ODL data already going to twitter a hrefhttpwww.tweetfeel.com relnofollowhttpwww.tweetfeel.comap  pBy using Twitter to track ODLs, you stop fighting to force people to use a given integration engine created just for that, like Google Health and HealthVault, and instead focus on improving the value of the ODL tracking system that people are already using, like Facebook or Twitter. But to do that, you need a generalizable approach for entering ODLs and for data mining those entries, so that you can get meaning at a higher, or at least different, level. p  pThere are also several syntaxs available for generalizing the approach to use Twitter to track whatever you like. These are the ones that I am most interested in. So far I know about severalp  pa hrefhttpwww.daytum.comabouthowtomobilesubmissions relnofollowDaytum has a twitter syntaxa.

Here is a generic version of my struct and the function that would add a struct to the arrayp  precodetypedef struct Example      const char name     int funcint, int     int boolswitch   int addstructtoarray Example examplearray, int exarraysize, int name, int funcint, int, int boolswitch       first, make a new struct     Example newexample  Example  calloc 1, sizeof Example       if newexample  NULL           newexamplegtname  name         newexamplegtfunc  func         newexamplegtboolswitch  boolswitch          exarraysize       else          printf Errror allocating sn, name          exit 1             now, realloc the array of structs and add the new member to it     Example tempexamplearray   Example realloc examplearray,  exarraysize   sizeof Example       if tempexamplearray  NULL           examplearray  tempexamplearray         examplearray[  exarraysize   1 ]  newexample      else          printf Reallocation failedn          exit 1           return 0  codepre  pAnd here is where I would call the functions notice how Im initially allocating the array of structs, cuz thats where the problem wasp  precodeinclude examplestruct.h  int main int argc, char argv       int exarraysize  0     Example examplearray   Example calloc 0, sizeof Example        addstructtoarray examplearray, ampexarraysize, name, ampfunction, 1      ...     ...     addstructtoarray examplearray, ampexarraysize, othername, ampotherfunc, 0        Do stuff here       examplearrayfree examplearray       return 0  codepre  pIn my ignorance, I apparently thought that allocating the array with size 0 would be ok, since it was initially empty, and I could add structs to it after that.  Obviously, this did not work, I would get runtime errors about codeerror for object 0x100100080 pointer being reallocated was not allocatedcode.  The codeexamplearraycode was at address code0x100100080code and the first struct I would allocate for would be at address code0x100100090code, and after a few reallocations the codeexamplearraycode would run out of room.p  pSo, finally, to my question.

Negative 2754 pI have recently migrated one of my solution from SVNCruiseControl to strongTFS2010strong. My build definition is using the Defaul Template. And I would like to customise the template. Since I have never worked with workflows before I decided to start by printing a simple message in the build log. For this purpose, I have added a strongWriteBuildMessagestrong activity right on the top of the sequence as its first activity and given it a value of Hello World. However after saving it, checking it in the source control, queuing, completing a new build and then opening the build, I do not see the Hello World message any where in the View Log, Sumary tab or msbuild log file. I have tried putting the strongWriteBuildMessagestrong activity at different places in the workflow but it just never gets printed. I can ensure that my build definition is pointing to the correct template but it just doesnt seem to print the message, as if it has never run the strongWriteBuildMessagestrong activities in the workflowp  pIs there somethign I am mising or is strongWriteBuildMessagestrong is not the correct activity to print a message in the log Any ideasp  pRegards,p  pNabeelp

Negative 2754 pCan anyone point me to a good reference on External Memory Mergesort  Ive read the wiki page but am having trouble understanding it exactly.  An animation might help but I cant seem to find one.p  pBasically, I know that you have a certain number of blocks on disk, and you can fit a certain number of blocks in memory.  Lets say you have 32 blocks on disk and 4 blocks in memory.  In the first pass you read 4 blocks into memory at a time, sort them in memory, and write them back out do disk.  So at this point you have 8 sorted runs of 4 blocks.  How does the merging work  Since I have 4 blocks in memory assume I have one more for output I think I should be able to merge 4 of those 8 runs at a time, and then merge the next 4 runs.  And then in the last pass I want to merge the whole thing.  But dont you have to read each block from disk each time  So how does this not become a n2 solutionp

The following is a combination of two files there may be more in a real situation p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltTempNodegt     ltRootNodegt         ltNodegt1ltNodegt         ltNodegt2ltNodegt     ltRootNodegt      ltRootNodegt         ltNodegt3ltNodegt         ltNodegt4ltNodegt       ltRootNodegt ltTempNodegt codepre  pwhere the first codeRootNodecode originally resided in codefile1.xmlcode and the second in codefile2.xmlcode. Due to the complexity of the actual XSLT, Ive figured that my best shot is to try to alter the coderootcodeparam. Ive tried the followingp  precodeltxslparam nameroot selectTempNodegt codepre  pThe problem is this. In the case of codeltxslparam nameroot selectdocumentfilesgtcode, the XPath expression codeNodecode in codeltxslforeach selectNodegtcode selects the Nodes from codefile1.xmlcode and codefile2.xmlcode independently, i.e. producing the following desired listp  pNode 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4,p  pHowever, when I combine the content of the two files into a single XML and parse this and use the suggested coderootcodedefinition, the expression codeNodecode will select all Nodes that are children of the codeTempNodecode. In other words, the desired list, as represented above, is produced twice due to the combination with the outer codeltxslforeach selectrootRootNodegtcode loop. p  pA side note as observed in comment a in a hrefhttpwww.dpawson.co.ukxslsect2N2602.htmld3862e214 relnofollowthis pagea, codedocumentcode apparently changes the root node, perhaps explaining this behavior.p  pMy question becomes  strongHow can I redefine coderootcode, using the combined XML as source instead of a multisource through document, so that the list is only produced once, without touching the remainder of the XSLTstrong Its like if coderootcode defined using the codedocumentcodefunction, there is no common root node in the param. Is it possible to define a param with two separate node treesp  pBtw Ive tried defining a document like thisp  precodeltxslparam namerootgt     ltxslforeach selectTempNodegt         ltxsldocumentgt             ltxslcopyof select.gt         ltxsldocumentgt     ltxslforeachgt ltxslparamgt codepre  pthinking it might solve the problem, but the codeNodecode expression still fetches all the Nodes. Is the context node in the codeltxsltemplate matchRootNodegtcodetemplate actually somewhere in the input document and not the param Honestly, Im pretty confused when it comes to context nodes.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2754 pIm developing a WPF application using the MVVM pattern. Im using MVVM Light library and Im also trying to use a dependency injector Im considering Ninject and Unity.p  pIve read a lot of blog articles and Im quite confused about the proper way of making my classes communicate with each other. In particular, I dont know when to use Dependency Injection and when to rely on the mediator pattern.p  pLets consider an example. I have a ViewModel, lets call it DataViewModel, and the Data class that provides some kind of data. How is it better to communicate between themp  pA. Inject a dependency to DataViewModel with an interface of IData This way Data will not have to rely on Messenger, but it will have to provide an event if the Data changes, and the ViewModel will have to subscribe to it.p  pB. Rely on the mediator pattern implemented in MVVM Light as Messenger and send messages between Model and ViewModel This way it will not be necessary to use Dependency Injection at all, because whole communication will be based on messages.p  pMoreover, should my ViewModels have injected dependencies on other ViewModels, or it would be better just to rely on the Messenger If the first, would it be necessary to define a separate interface for each ViewModel I think that defining an interface for each VM will be an additional work, but maybe it is worth it.p

Negative 2754 pIm making a game, and I have a class called MainCharacter that first initializes the main character in a pictureBox and then I had a KeyDown event for handling the movement. Inside that event, I was able to handle character movement if I pressed arrow keys, and Ive even done a timerbased animation of movement to make it seem more smooth. p  pHowever, the problem with KeyDown event is that it fires every time I press the key, meaning that if Im holding down the arrow key so that the character would continue moving in one direction, the event is fired repeatedly, meaning that the character runs over the screen like a torpedo, because the event is fired as fast as computer can handle it.p  pThats why I decided to use the KeyPress event, so that when I held the key down, the character would move in the designated direction at a steady velocity. However, KeyPress event cant handle arrow keys, which is why I had to override the ProcessDialogKey method in the main form. But if I override it in main form, then the event will be fired every time I press the arrow key, even when Im not in the game, but for example in main menu or anywhere else. Beside, I think that would be bad practice, if I tried to program things through crossing classes so much anyway.p  pSo, is there any other way for me to handle the KeyPress event on arrows iinsidei my MainCharacter class without affecting other classes Or is there a chance for me to stay with the KeyDown event, which I already had working, and make it so that it cannot fire repeatedly if I hold down the key Remember, what I want to achieve is for my character to move fluently when I hold down my key. So far, it works fine, if I press it only once, but usually people hold down keys when they walk in one direction.p  pHelp would be much appreciated. p

Negative 2754 pI wrote a simple programcalculating the number of steps for the numbers 11010 using the collatz conjecturein both python and c. They were nearly identical, and neither were written for multithreading. I ran the one in python and according to my system manager, one core went straight to 100 usage, the others staying the same. I ran the c program and the cores stayed at their same fluctuating between 10 and 15 usage states, never really changing. They both completed around the same time, within seconds. Could someone explain to me why this is happeningp

Negative 2754 pI have been told that a great way to decrease the load on my own site is pointing known CSS and JS to public URLs. p  pFor instance, JQuery or Blueprint.

Negative 2754 pIm working with a RichTextBox control, and its going great, except for the line spacing. Im using an interop call via SendMessage with PARAFORMAT2 to set the line spacing for a paragraph.p  pThat works great. It does EXACTLY what I need it to do. The problem is, when I save the RTF string out, then bring it back in, the line spacing information is gone. p  pI can prove this by adding a second RichText Box, and using the code below. In richTextBox1, the rtf string is formatted properly. But by the time it gets to richTextBox2, its singlespaced again.p  pcodep  precode    private void button15Clickobject sender, EventArgs e              string rtf  richTextBox1.Rtf          richTextBox2.Rtf  rtf      codepre  pcodep  pAny suggestions for keeping the formatting I know I can go in and mangle the RTF string using the ls setting, but that is VERY painful. Is there a cleaner solution that Im just missing somewherep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe EMSTREAMINOUT suggestions are awesome, but unfortunately result in the same insanity. As Ive read more on STREAMIN and STREAMOUT, Ive discovered that SaveFile and LoadFile provided by the control are simple wrappers for these two message commands, so for simplicity Im using those two commands in this sample. Im attaching a sample application.

In this case, I need to close and reopen it to make it compilework again.p  pAnyone experienced the same issues andor knows how to avoid them Do you think this problem could be caused by some sort of problem in the app Im developing or could it be a Netbeans memory leak or bugp

Negative 2754 pSo I have a basic web server setup with a LAMP stack on CentOS. It has modrewrite and all the basic modules. The routing I have used is working on other servers and locally. But when I try to use the routes on the new server they give me a 404 error. Now the kicker is that the regular default routes work i.e. indexmypage works but the special route mypage does not on this server so I know modrewrite is firing correctly. Also, there are no actual files with the route names so there is no conflict there.p  pMy guess is something is not configured right for the router being I have done this before the same way and had no problem. I am wondering if anyone knows any potential little things that the router may need to run that I might have missed.p  pThank you for any insight.p  pstrongUPDATE Here are the Rewrite htaccess entries I have triedstrongp  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteBase  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule .jsicotxtgifjpgpngcss index.php codepre  pand from another Dev I work withp  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME s [OR] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME l [OR] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule .

Negative 2754 pI hope someone will be able to help me..I m new to ASP.NET. I m designing a user inteface in ASp.NEt C where the user can login and then launch an application. When using this application the user has to fill out a form that is 10 pages long. So, I have used navigation menu and designed the inteface in such a way where every page is different menu item and it is a static menu. The problem is Lets say the user fills out the details on the first page of the form ...saves it and the data gets saved in the database. The problem is lets say he moves to the other page by clicking the menu tab....when he comes back to the first page by using the menu tab for that page all the filled in data is gone and he sees a blank page. I know that is how it works but I want it in such a way that in one sitting when he is filling out the data on the second page  after filling the data on first page on reverting back to the first page he should be able to see the data that he had filled out. What concept can i use...I m not sure view state will be helpful in this scenario...Can anyone guide me with a concept and some example code that cld be helpful...I m sorry if I m asking for to much...but its little urgent. p

There may be a number of reasons why this could happen       The server name is misspelled or the port number is incorrect.      SQL Server is not configured to use TCPIP. Either enable TCPIP from SQL Servers Network Utility app or have jTDS connect via named pipes see the URL format for information on how to do this.      There is a firewall blocking port 1433 on the server.  To check whether TCPIP is enabled and the port is not blocked you can use telnet 1433. Until telnet doesnt connect, jTDS wont either. If you cant figure out why, ask your network administrator for help. codepre

Negative 2754 pI am trying to automate the set up of site creation for our inhouse development server.p  pCurrently, this consists of creating a system user, mysql user, database, and apache config. I know how I can do everything in a single bash file, but I wanted to ask if there was a way to more cleanly generate the apache config.p  pEssentially what I want to do is generate a conf file based on a template, similar to using printf. I could certainly use printf, but I thought there might be a cleaner way, using sed or awk. p  pThe reason I dont just want to use printf is because the apache config is about 20 lines long, and will take up most of the bash script, as well as make it harder to read.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

However, when totalSeconds gets incremented in the timers fire method, the observeValueForKeyPath method never gets called. Also, for those who are wondering why I am using KVO for this, it is because in the real app this is just a test application, I need to display multiple running stopwatches at different times on the screen and record the elapsed times.

Negative 2754 pI just read two articles over this topic which provide infomration inconsistent, so I want to know which one is correct. Perhaps both are correct, but under what contextp  pThe a hrefhttpwww.hardwaresecrets.comarticleHowaCPUWorks2095firsta one states that we fetch a strongpage sizestrong a timep  blockquote   pThe cache controller is always observing the memory positions being loaded and loading data from several memory positions after the memory position that has just been read. p      pTo give you a real example, if the CPU loaded data stored in the address 1,000, the cache controller will load data from n addresses after the address 1,000. This number n is called page if a given processor is working with 4 KB pages which is a typical value, it will load data from 4,096 addresses below the current memory position being load address 1,000 in our example. In following Figure, we illustrate this example.p blockquote  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnEVDs.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe a hrefhttpwww.hardwaresecrets.comarticleHowTheMemoryCacheWorks4816seconda one states that we fetch strongsizeofcache line  sizeofprefetcherstrong a timep  blockquote   pSo we can summarize how the memory cache works asp      ol   liThe CPU asks for instructiondata stored in address a.li   liSince the contents from address a arent inside the memory cache, the CPU has to fetch it   directly from RAM.li   liThe cache controller loads a line typically 64 bytes starting at address a into the memory   cache. This is more data than the CPU requested, so if the program continues to run sequentially   i.e. asks for address a1 the next instructiondata the CPU will ask will be already loaded in the   memory cache.li   liA circuit called prefetcher loads more data located after this line, i.e. starts loading the contents   from address a64 on into the cache. To give you a real example, Pentium 4 CPUs have a 256byte    prefetcher, so it loads the next 256 bytes after the line already loaded into the cache.li   ol blockquote
Negative 2754 pIn my MVC3 application, I have a queries class specific to each controller that performs conversions between domain entities and converts them to view models.  I do this to keep my controllers clean and its easier to unit test the controllers and queries seperately.  p  pThere are cases, though, when the query method needs to pass strongnonexceptional error messagesstrong to the view e.g. the entity was not found.  However, since my controller is only receiving a ViewModel from the query method and not any type of return code, the only two options that I have found to pass this error are as followsp  ol lipThrow an Exception from the query method and use a TryCatch block to catch the exception in the controller.  pli lipAdd a property to the View Model called ErrorMessage which is populated by the query method that the view uses to perform logic of what needs displayed.pli ol  pBecause these arent exceptional cases, and I know I shouldnt use TryCatch to control program flow, I have choosen to use the second method.

This should be faster and I am expecting better play back.p  pQuestionsp  pa Is my understanding correctp  pb If yes, how can I put my media file to other memory instead of SD, and how to get the path of this new location coz I need to pass this path to my application which decodes the frame and plays it back on the screen.      p  pThanksp
Negative 2754 pSo basically I want to parse the Enron public emails dataset and I am uncertain about email formatting and types back in the day. I am unfamiliar with MIME types and those other formatting details. So I want to know if all emails have the same first couple lines and last couple lines. p  pI essentially want to get rid of everything but the body of emails. So I would also like to know whether it would be easier not knowing what I know, to use the C method of parsing by lines or to essentially try to clean up all the emails to leave just want I need. I dont care too much about white space, but I am also not very skilled at regex or lexical parsing so if anyone has good references on refreshing regex or can breakdown probably the only rules that Ill probably need that would be great.  p

Every command in this app begins with  symbol. See pics herep  pa hrefhttpi46.tinypic.comzx5edv.jpg relnofollowhttpi46.tinypic.comzx5edv.jpgap  pWhat Im trying to do is, use StandardInput.WriteLinestat vout to measure the voltage.

Duing all this time, it still in the blocking mode.p  pI want to get the return message with StandardOutput.ReadLine but failed. If ReadToEnd then my program is freezed because this app never return to standard console, which is blocking.p  pWhen I tried BeginOutputReadLine OutputDataReceived event can truly obtain the message return from the console, like in the pics of stat [voutvbusfault. But it limited in my single thread program.p  pMy current situation is that, I use System.Timers.Timers in WinForms and every second will send a  stat vout2 command to read the voltage, and hopefully get the return value.p  pHowever, the System.Timers.Timers is asynchronous, so when I called BeginOutputReadLine in this Timers thread, it prompted An async read operation has already been started on the stream. In the meantime, as Ive demonstrated above, I cannot use synchronous methods like ReadLine to get the value.p  pSo what should I do now I truly need to run this command line app in multithreading mode.p  pThanks so much and wish everybody has a nice weekend.p  pUPDATE on Apr 28 1918 CST Here is the relevant source codep  pOne of the WinFroms button will Start the SystemClock Class, then Timing.Measuring is executed every second.

Both of them use BeginOutputReadLine to get result since StandardOutput didnt work.p  pI use a isOutputObtained flag to indicating if data returned.

I recolored the icon and it looked great, however when I went to display the containing Control, I get the following errorp  pemThe following exception occurred in the DataGridViewemp  pemSystem.ArgumentException  Parameter is not valid.em   emat System.Drawing.Image.FromStreamStream stream, Boolean useEmbeddedColorManagement, Boolean validateImageDataem   emat System.Drawing.ImageConverter.convertFromITypeDescriptorContext context, CultureInfo culture, Object valueem   emat System.Windows.Forms.Formatter.FormatObjectInternalObject value, Type targetType, TypeConverter sourceConverter, TypeConverter targetConverter, String formatString, IFormatProvider formatInfo, Object formattedNullValue, Object dataSourceNullValueem   emat System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell.GetFormattedValueObject value, Int32 rowIndex, DataGridViewCellStyleamp cellStyle, TypeConverter valueTypeConverter, TypeConverter formattedValueTypeConverter, DataGridViewDataErrorContexts contextemp  pemTo replace this default dialog please handle the DataError event.emp  pWhen I create the DataTable to be populated with the data, I use this on the column that will have the iconp  precodedt.Columns.AddsDirection dt.Columns[sDirection].DataType  typeofByte[] codepre  pWhen I add the data to the rows, I have a method to convert the Icon.p  precodeinternal static Byte[] ConvertIconToByteArrayIcon pIcon          MemoryStream ms  new MemoryStream         pIcon.Savems         return ms.GetBuffer  codepre  pAnd I add the DataTable to the DataGridView withp  precodegrdMMSList.DataSource  dt.DefaultView codepre  pMethod calls removed from the above code for clarityp  pI followed through in the debugger, and setting the DefaultView as the DataSource is where the error is getting thrown.

Negative 2754 pI have three div elements, and I want to populate each element with its own content. I call the same AJAX very generic function each time, sending the name of the div id as a parameterp  precodeleftright rectangle content var rl  getContentrightLeft     bottom content var br  getContentbottomRectangle  top content var rtr  getContentrightTopRectangle codepre  pIf I do an alerthttp.responseText within the AJAX function, I get the correct html content from the remote page. In fact, if I add an alert, it seems to slow the function down so that my content is returned properly each time I call it, but who wants alerts on their web page.p  pBut, without the alerts, the above calls will only properly process the last call. So, in the above sequence of calls, only the last div, where idrightTopRectangle will be filled with the html retrieved from the AJAX call. The previous two calls dont populate their divs with the AJAX retrieved html. If I shake up the order of the calls, it will always be the last AJAX call that works.p  pI get the feeling the problem has something to do with the asynchronous part, where the previous calls dont have enough time to process the request before the AJAX function is requested again and again.p  pHeres the AJAX functionp  precodefunction getContentelement     var url  ajaxgetcontent.phpcidelement alerturl     http.onreadystatechangefunction         if http.readyState4 ampamp http.status200 alerthttp.responseText             var response  http.responseXML.documentElement             callbackelement,http.responseText                   http.openGET,url,true     http.send          codepre  pThe function named callback it works fine looks like thisp  precodefunction callbacke,c     document.getElementByIde.innerHTML  ltdiv stylelineheight document.getElementByIde.offsetHeight pxmargin0px auto 0px autotextaligncenter gt  unescapec  ltdivgt  codepre  pUPDATE This works now.

Negative 2754 pI have a class that derives from a C struct. The class does not do anything special, other than initialization in the constructor, deinitialization function during the destructor, and a few other methods that call into C functions. Basically, its a runofthemill wrapper. Using GCC, it complained that my destructor was not virtual, so I made it that. Now I run into segfaults.p  precode C header file  struct A     ...

So this may not be the case, since I get a segfault in the C function.p  pBy removing the codevirtualcode keyword, the code works fine, except that I get a gcc warning. What is the best work around for this Feel free to enlighten me .p

Negative 2754 pThe a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combtmarqarchive20070721aspnetthreadusageoniis70and60.aspxfollowinga article by Thomas Marquardt describes how IIS handles ASP.Net requests, the maxmin CLR worker threadsManaged IO threads that can be configured to run, the various requests queues involved and their default sizes.p  pNow as per the article, the following occurs in IIS 6.0p  ol liASP.NET picks up the requests from a IIS IO Thread and posts HSESTATUSPENDING to IIS IO Threadli liThe requests is handed over to a CLR Worker threadli liIf the requests are of high latency and all the threads are occupied the thread count approaches httpRuntime.minFreeThreads, then the requests are posted to the Application level request queue this queue is per AppDomainli listrikeAlso ASP.NET checks the number of concurrently executing requests. The article states that if the number of concurrently executing requests is too high it queues the incoming requests to a ASP.NET global request queue this is per Worker Processstrike Please check Update 2li ol  pI want to know what is the threshold value at which point ASP.NET considers that the number of requests currently executing it too high and then starts queuing the requests to the global ASP.NET request queuep  pI think this threshold will depend upon the configuration of max number of worker threads, but there might be some formula based on which ASP.NET will determine that the number of concurrently executing requests is too high and starts queuing the requests to the ASP.NET global request queue. What might this formula or is this setting configurablep  phr strongUpdatestrong br I read through the article again and in the comments sections I found thisp  blockquote   p1 On IIS 6 and in IIS 7 classic mode, each application AppDomain   has a queue that it uses to maintain the availability of worker   threads. The number of requests in this queue increases if the number   of available worker threads falls below the limit specified by   httpRuntime minFreeThreads.   When the limit specified by   httpRuntime appRequestQueueLimit is exceeded, the request is   rejected with a 503 status code and the client receives an   HttpException with the message Server too busy.   There is also an   ASP.NET performance counter, Requests In Application Queue, that   indicates how many requests are in the queue.  Yes, the CLR thread   pool is the one exposed by the .NET ThreadPool class.p      p2 The requestQueueLimit is poorly named.  It actually limits the   maximum number of requests that can be serviced by ASP.NET   concurrently.  This includes both requests that are queued and   requests that are executing.  If the Requests Current performance   counter exceeds requestQueueLimit, new incoming requests will be   rejected with a 503 status code.p blockquote  pstrike So essentially requestQueueLimit limits the number of requests that are queued I am assuming it will sum the number of requests queued in Application queues plus the global ASP.Net request queue plus the number of requests currently executing and are executing. All though this does not answer the original question, it does provide information about when we might receive a 503 server busy error because of high number of concurrent requestshigh latency requests. strikeCheck update 2p  hr  pstrongUpdate 2strong There was a mistake in my part in the understanding. I had mixed up the descriptions for IIS 6 and IIS 7.br Essentially when ASP.NET is hosted on IIS 7.5 and 7.0 in integrated mode, the applicationlevel queues are no longer present, ASP.NET maintains a global request queue.  br So IIS 77.5 will start to queue requests to the global request queue if the number of executing requests is deemed high. The question applies more to IIS 77.5 rather than 6. brbr As far strongemIIS 6.0emstrong is concerned, there is no global ASP.NET request queue, but the following is truebr 1. ASP.NET picks up the requests from a IIS IO Thread and posts HSESTATUSPENDING to IIS IO Threadbr 2. The requests is handed over to a CLR Worker threadbr 3. If the requests are of high latency and all the threads are occupied the thread count approaches httpRuntime.minFreeThreads, then the requests are posted to the Application level request queue this queue is per AppDomainbr 4. Also ASP.NET checks the number of requests queued and currently executing before accepting a new request. If this number is greater than value specified by processModel.requestQueueLimit then incoming requests will be rejected with 503 server busy error.p

Thing is, i guess were dealing with a best practise type situation, and none of the few beginner books i have really helped with it, so i hope you guys can.p  pSo, i have two forms, one is a splashscreenstartup form and the other is the main game window. I made a class that contains all world data, and when in the first screen user clicks on new game, a new instance of this class is generated and populated with data.p  pSo far so good.p  pThe newgame button, in addition to creating the world instance, opens up the main game window.  The problem is, in the main game window, when i try to use attributes of the gameworld instance, it says that it doesnt exist in this context.p  pSo, if i get it right, the created instance only exists within the first form class... is that correctp  pSo if id like to move that whole data, should i actually serialize and save the world class instance data, and load it in the second form Or how should i approach this.p  pI understand its a very newbie question, and i could propably hack it to work, but the thing is  i really feel like i have to understand everything im doing.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2754 pI am doing some work updating a data access library that our company uses to call stored procedures on an Oracle database.  The library currently allows the calling application to use a single OracleCommand IDbCommand object and a single OracleConnection IDBConnection to make several calls.  This means the caller would add parameters for a call, make the call, clear the parameters and repeat.  When finished, the consumer application calls dispose to clean everything up.p  pI can make things much cleaner by using using statements within the library to make sure the command and connection objects are cleaned up after each call but this would mean the above functionality would be lost and a new commandconnection would be created per call. I see this being done in most examples I find, but then they are usually only simple examples.p  pMy question Is it worthwhile to allow the command andor the connection to persist between calls  Is it overly expensive to recreate them each timep

Negative 2754 pYes, I sounds crazy to me too. Pull my hair out, bang my head on the keyboard crazy. Thats why Im here begging p  pHopefully this isnt too briefp  pIm embedding an iframe in a WordPress adminside add new entry form. Prior to the iframe being displayed in a meta box a cookie is set. The iframe looks for that cookie as a means of authentication. If the cookie has a particular value the user does not have to signin to the service provided by the iframe. They are automatically logged in. However, the only way I can get the iframe to see the cookie is to hit F12 and then refresh the page. Once I do that the autologin happens as expected. Obviously, hitting F12 is not an optimal UX p  pEverything works fine in Chrome and Firefox.   p  pThe only other detail Ive noticed is that even once I get the iframe to see the cookie and authenticate the button for selecting a file to upload doesnt work.

That detail probably doesnt matter but if youve read this far Im sure youre curious.p  pAgain, everything works fine in Chrome and Firefox.p
Negative 2754 pI built a Eclipse RCP application and packaged it using InnoSetup. When I install the packaged application to the default destination CProgram FilesXXX, the data argument in the INIfile gets ignored it is set to the installation directory data CProgram FilesXXX. Instead, the configuration data is saved in the users application data folder. If I install it to CXXX, the data argument works as advertised and the configuration data is saved in the installation folder.p  pIf I copy a nonpackaged build of my application in a folder under CProgram Files, interestingly, the data argument is also regarded correctly, unlike the packaged installation.p  pThe InnoSetup script file has no direct instructions to set a directory for configuration data, so I think it is an issue with Eclipse RCP. Furthermore, the write permission for all the folders talked about here are complete for all users.p  pId be glad for pointers where to look, in order to force Eclipse RCP to save my configuration data where I want it to be.p

On that NavigationControl I have two requirements, handling a history for backforward navigation simple enough and being able to Present any control deriving from the type NavigationFrameBase visually.  NavigationFrameBase, also deriving from UserControl may be presented in many forms as multiple controls will inherit from this type, but the NavigationFrameBase should provide a form of notification to the NavigationControl to inform it that the user interacting with the content of a type derived from NavigationFrameBase has requested a Navigate operation, allowing the NavigationControl to present a new NavigationFrameBase.p  pMy issues are two fold p  ul liWhat is the best way to design NavigationControl in order to contain an instance of NavigationFrameBase it will present li liWhat is the proper way in WPF to handle the childparent request system  RoutedAttached events seem to be right, but I could see a mediator pattern serving the same function.li ul

Negative 2754 pI have a Java bot that Im working on which takes input from a user via an IRC message. The user types in something like .host filefoo filebar hostnamethis is a name and it will start a server for them based on their input.p  pRight now I have a method that basically parses their message, looking for hostname must be encapsulated by quotes, splitting the hostname part, and setting the hostname to whatever their result is for example, hostnamethis is a name would become hostname this is a name. I am using regex to do this.p  pI then split the string into an array separated by spaces and pass the information to processbuilder, which executes the command in its own thread. The final command looks something like thisp  p.server hostname this is a namep  pA problem I am running into is that since I am splitting by spaces, if the user adds a dash in the hostname for example, hostnamethis is  a name, itll think that the dash is referring to an argument, and will basically chop off the rest.p  pFurther explanation processbuilder will split by spaces, so it will pass hostname , this , is ,  , a , name. This is where Im having trouble, since  means I should be passing an argument, but thats not what I am using it for.p  pWhat would be the most efficient way to implement this so that any character being passed is only literally this character Should I not be splitting at spaces If I run .server hostname this is  a name from the linux shell, it will run fine.p  pI appreciate any and all help.

And it works well so far img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8JrSC.png altSonata Admin with onetomany relationship and file uploads.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pBut theres one ceveat When i hit the green  sign once add a new exchange file form row, strongthen select a file in my filesystemstrong, then hit the  sign again a new form row is appended via Ajax, select another file, and then hit Update save the current Client, strongthen the first file is not persistedstrong. Only the second file can be found in the database and the file system.p  pAs far as I could find out, this has the following reason When the green  sign is clicked the second time, the current form is post to the web server, including the data currently in the form Client and all exchange files. A new form is created and the request is bound into the form this happens in the codeAdminHelpercode class located in codeSonataAdminBundleAdmincodep  precodepublic function appendFormFieldElementAdminInterface admin, subject, elementId       retrieve the subject     formBuilder  admingtgetFormBuilder      form  formBuildergtgetForm     formgtsetDatasubject     formgtbindadmingtgetRequest  lt here      SNIP  codepre  pSo the entire form is bound, a form row is appended, the form is sent back to the browser and the entire form is overwritten by the new one. But since file inputs codeltinput typefile gtcode cannot be prepopulated for security reasons, the first file is lost. The file is only stored on the filesystem when the entity is persisted I think codeVichUploaderBundlecode uses Doctrines codeprePersistcode for this, but this does not yet happen when a form field row is appended.p  pstrongMy first question isstrong How can i solve this problem, or which direction should i go I would like the following use case to work I want to create a new Client and I know Ill upload three files. I click New Client, enter the Client data, hit the green  button once, select the first file. Then i hit the  sign again, and select the second file. Same for the third file. All three files should be persisted.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Why does Sonata Admin post the entire form when I only want to add a single form row in a onetomany relationship Is this really necessary This means that if I have file inputs, all files present in the form are uploaded every time a new form row is added.p  pThanks in advance for your help. If you need any details, let me know.p

Negative 2754 pThis post is divided to two major sections. The first section introduces the original test cases amp results, and my thoughts about it. The second section details the modified test case, and its results.p  pThe original title of this topic was Full iteration over an array significantly faster than with a linked list. The title was changed due to the newer test results presented in Section Two.p  hr  h2strongSECTION ONE The Original Test Casestrongh2  pFor a full onedirectional sequential traversal, its known that the linked list and the array have similar performance, but due to the cachefriendliness reference locality of the contiguous array, it may perform slightly better. To see how it works in the practice Android, Java, I examined the above claims, and made some measurements.p  pFirst of all, my naive assumptions. Lets take a look at the following classp  precodeprivate static class Message      public int value1     public Message next      public Messagejava.util.Random r, Message nextmsg          value1  r.nextInt         next  nextmsg       codepre  pIn the first measurement scenario, its codenextcode field will not be used at all. The below code creates an array of 1,000,000 codeMessagecode instances, and then iterates over the array in a loop. It measures how much time the iteration takes.p  precodeLog.iTEST, Preparing...            final int cnt  1000000 int val  0 java.util.Random r  new java.util.Random Message[] messages  new Message[cnt] for int i  0 i lt cnt i      messages[i]  new Messager, null              Log.iTEST, Starting iterating... long start  SystemClock.uptimeMillis  for int i  0 i lt cnt i      Message msg  messages[i]     if msg.value1 gt 564645          val              Log.wTEST, Time   SystemClock.uptimeMillis  start  , result   val codepre  pThe second measurement builds and measures a linked list of codeMessagecode objects insteadp  precodeLog.iTEST, Preparing...            final int cnt  1000000 int val  0 java.util.Random r  new java.util.Random Message current  null Message previous  null for int i  0 i lt cnt i      current  new Messager, previous     previous  current  previous  null  Log.iTEST, Starting iterating... long start  SystemClock.uptimeMillis while current  null      if current.value1 gt 564645          val          current  current.next              Log.wTEST,Time   SystemClock.uptimeMillis  start  , result   val codepre  pThe first test constantly produces strong4144strong ms, while the second test gives strong8085strong ms. The linked list iteration seems to be 100 slower.p  pMy possibly flawed train of thought and issues is as follows. Ill welcome in fact, encourage any corrections.p  pOK, we can often read that an array is a contiguous memory block, and thus accessing its elements sequentially is more cachefriendly than in case of a linked list. strongButstrong in our case, the elements of the array are only strongobject referencesstrong, and not codeMessagecode objects themselves in Java, we dont have value type i.e. struct as in C that we could store embedded in an array. Therefore, the locality of reference only applies to array elements themselves, and these only specify the strongaddressstrong of objects. Consequently, the codeMessagecode instances in general could still be anywhere in the memory, so the locality of reference doesnt apply to the instances themselves. From this point, it looks like we are the same as in case of a linked list the stronginstances themselvesstrong may reside anywhere in memory the array only guarantees that their strongreferencesstrong are stored in a contiguous block...p  p...and here comes the usecase complete sequential traversal iteration. First, lets examine how we get the strongreferencesstrong to instances in each case. In case of the array, its very efficient, because theyre in a contiguous block. strongButstrong in case of the linked list, were also good, because once weve accessed a codeMessagecode instance thats why we iterate, we immediately have the reference to the strongnextstrong instance. And since weve accessed a field of codeMessagecode already, accessing another field the next should be supported by the cache the fields of the same object also have a locality of references AFAIK, theyre in a contiguous block, too. To sum up, it seems to break down to thisp  ol liThe array offers a cachefriendly iteration over references. codeMessagecode instances themselves may be anywhere in memory, and we need to visit these, too.li liThe linked list offers that the reference to the next element is obtained when the current codeMessagecode instance is accessed. This is free, because each codeMessagecode instance must be visited anyway just like in the array case.li ol  pSo, based on the above, it looks like the array is not better than the linked list. The only exception is when the array is of primitive type but in such a case, it wouldnt make sense to compare it with a linked list. So Id expect that they perform similarly, but they didnt, as there was a huge difference. In fact, if we assume that the array indexing requires a range check each time an element is accessed, the linked list in theory could be faster, even. The range check of the array access is probably optimized away by the JIT, so I understand that this is not a valid point.p  pMy guesses are the followingp  ol lipIts probably not the arrays cachefriendliness that is responsible for the 100 difference. Instead, the JIT performs optimizations that cant be done in case of the linked list traversal. If the range check and VMlevel null check are eliminated, then I guess the arrayget bytecode instruction might be faster than my fieldget or whatever its called instruction in the linked list case .pli lipEven though the codeMessagecode instances could be anywhere in memory, they are probably very close to each other, because they were allocated at the same time. But 1,000,000 instances cant be cached, only a part of them. In such a case, sequential access would be cachefriendly both in the array and in the linked list case, so this doesnt explain the difference.pli lipSome intelligent prediction prefetch of the codeMessagecode instance Ill access I.e. somehow there is still cachefriendliness with the codeMessagecode instances themselves, but strongonlystrong in case of the array access.pli ol  pUPDATE Since several comments were received, Id like to react to them below.p  pirreputablep  blockquote   pthe linked list is visited from high address to low address. what if   its the other way around, i.e. next points to a newer object, not a   previous objectp blockquote  pVery good spot I didnt think to this little detail that the layout may influence the test. Ill test it today and will return with the results. emEdit results are here, Ive updated this post with Section 2.emp  pTorben commentsp  blockquote   pAlso I would say that this whole exercise seems pretty useless. You   are talking about 4ms improvement over 100000 iterations. Seems like   premature optimization. If you have a situation where this is a   bottleneck, then please describe it and we can look into it because   it definitely would be a more interesting problem than this.p blockquote  pIf its not interesting to you, then you can disregard this topic instead of posting 4 times. About your baseless assumption of premature optimization  Im afraid you read too much SO and perform too little industriallevel development. The concrete situation is in a simulationrelated software which might have to traverse these lists several times per second. Indeed, 120 ms latency may affect the responsiveness of an app.p  blockquote   pI appreciate the thought you put into this, but I really cant find a   question from your post.  Edit And array iteration is 50 faster.   100 faster would mean zero time consumed.p blockquote  pIm sure it was pretty obvious from my post that Im wondering why is the very significant difference present, when the arguments would imply otherwise. Thanks for the correction indeed, I wanted to write that the linked list case is 100 slower.p  hr  h2strongSECTION TWO The Modified Test Casesstrongh2  pemirreputableem had a very interesting observation for mep  blockquote   pthe linked list is visited from high address to low address. what if   its the other way around, i.e. next points to a newer object, not a   previous objectp blockquote  pI changed the linked list structure such that the direction of its codenextcode pointers is equal to the instantiation order of its nodesp  precodeMessage current  null Message previous  new Messager, null Message first  previous for int i  0 i lt cnt i      current  new Messager, null     previous.next  current     previous  current         previous  current  null codepre  pNote that the creation algorithm might not be the most compact one, I think I knew a slightly nicer way.

This is because the object arrays only hold emreferencesem to object instances, not the object instances themselves which can be, in theory, anywhere in memory, just like in case of the linked list.pli lipIn my test cases, the result seems to be dependent strongon the direction of traversalstrong, even in case of the array scenario . How is this possiblepli ol  pTo sum up my test resultsp  ol lipIn forward direction traversal, the linked list slightly outperforms the array traversal exactly as expected we have the strongnextstrong reference immediately when a codeMessagecode instance is obtained, i.e. even there is no need to access an array element for obtaining its address.pli lipIn backward direction traversal, both have about 100 weaker performance and the linked list also slightly outperforms the array.pli ol  pAny ideasp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong emdlthorpeem made very valuable comments. Ill copy them here, as they might help in finding an answer to this riddle.p  blockquote   pIs there any indication that the hardware implements a lookahead page   prefetch in the memory cache controller Instead of loading only the   memory page needed for a memory reference, also load the next higher   page in anticipation of a forward progressive read This would   eliminate page load waits for forward progressions through memory but   would not eliminate page load waits for reverse progressions through   memory.p      p[..]p      pId suggest testing on radically different hardware. Most mobile   devices are running some form of ARM SoC. See if the test cases show   similar skew on Intel hardware, like a PC or a Mac. If you can dig up   an old PowerPC Mac, even better. If these dont show similar results,   then that would point to something unique on the ARM platform or its   Java implementation.p      p[..]p      pRight, your access patterns are mostly sequential, but in different   directions. If something underneath you is doing prefetch but only in   one direction prefetch next higher address block, then that will   skew the results in favor of the tests that run in that direction.p blockquote  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I ran the tests on a PC Core i7 Nehalem architecture from Feb. 2009, 8 GB RAM, Windows 7.

Negative 2754 pI am trying to make a website look better in IE, so i decided to use conditional comments. So I used this conditional comment to link to the stylesheet.  p  precodelt[if IE]gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefIEstyle.css gt lt[end if]gt codepre  pThat doesnt work, and it will either use the default stylesheet or it will display a blank page.

Negative 2754 pI have a view that renders a table of editable data. The page has Ajax controls that allow you to add and delete single rows on the table. I accomplish this with a stronglytyped view that has a model that derives from IEnumerable. In the view, it loops through each item in the model and renders it using a partial view that is stronglytyped to that object. In this way, the controller can use the parent view to render the entire list, and the Ajax endpoint can use the partial view to render and return just one table row for jQuery to insert into the table.p  pWhen the save button is clicked, jQuery loops through the table, packages up the data and assigns sequential numbers so that when the data is POSTed to the server, the model binding engine recognizes the data as codeIEnumerableltTimeLogEntrygtcode.p  pHeres my list view with unnecessary code stripped outp  precodemodel IEnumerableltTimeTracker.Models.TimeLogEntrygt  lttable idtimeloggt     lttheadgt         lttrgt             ltthgt                 Html.DisplayNameFormodel gt model.FirstOrDefault.StartTime             ltthgt             ltthgt                 Html.DisplayNameFormodel gt model.FirstOrDefault.EndTime             ltthgt             ltthgt                 Html.DisplayNameFormodel gt model.FirstOrDefault.Description             ltthgt         lttrgt     lttheadgt      lttbodygt         foreach var item in Model.OrderByDescendingentry gt entry.StartTime                      Html.RenderPartialViewsTimeLogEditEntry.cshtml, item              lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pAnd the partial view that that displays one single codeTimeLogEntrycodep  precodemodel TimeTracker.Models.TimeLogEntry  lttr idModel.TimeLogEntryIdgt     lttd classnowrapgt         Html.EditorFormodel gt model.StartTime         Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.StartTime     lttdgt     lttd classnowrapgt         Html.EditorFormodel gt model.EndTime         Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.EndTime     lttdgt     lttdgt         Html.EditorFormodel gt model.Description         Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.Description     lttdgt lttrgt codepre  pThis code doesnt validate properly because the partial view that renders it is separated from the IEnumerable that the item came from, and thus has no idea that it is executing in the context of a foreach loop. Therefore, the elements in each table row will have identical names and IDs, which causes a problem for clientside validation. For example, all of the codeStartTimecode textboxes have an ID of codeStartTimecode, instead of code[0].StartTimecode, code[1].StartTimecode, etc. The EditorFor method has no way to set the codeidcode or codedatavalmsgforcode attributes. How do I make each textbox codeidcode attribute unique, and the codedatavalmsgforcode attribute on each validation message match its corresponding textbox ID Is there another better way that I should be doing thisp

Negative 2754 pI am having difficulty getting this assignment to be functional without using anything we havent learned yet...p  pI have to have a variable defined globally, egp  precodex  [80, 70, 65, 60, 50, 40, 45, 40, 35, 7, 0] codepre  pgiven this global variable, I need to call its values with conditional statement to give a particular result. All I can think of based off what we have gone over in class isp  precodex  [80, 70, 65, 60, 50, 40, 45, 40, 35, 7, 0]  if x gt 50     printGood else     printBad codepre  pand this simply will not work... But what I have got to work is the followingp  precodefor x in [80, 70, 65, 60, 50, 40, 45, 40, 35, 7, 0]     if x gt 50         printGood     else         printBad codepre  pThis apparently is just simply not acceptable for the assignment though, due to the global variable is not defined as it should be. Also, the assignment deals with the turtle module, and the characteristics of the turtle will change based on the integer values in the list.p  pso now i come to answers given here already for an example more directly related to the assignment..p  precodeimport turtle  def drawBart, height     t.beginfill     t.left90     t.forwardheight     t.write   strheight     t.right90     t.forward40     t.right90     t.forwardheight     t.left90     t.endfill     if height gt 50         t.fillcolorblue     elif height lt 50 and height gt 30         t.fillcoloryellow     else         t.fillcolorred  xs  [80, 70, 65, 60, 50, 40, 45, 40, 70, 7, 0]  maxheight  maxxs numbars  lenxs border  10  bob  turtle.Turtle bob.colorblue bob.pensize3  wn  turtle.Screen wn.bgcolorlightgreen wn.setworldcoordinates0border,0border,40numbarsborder,maxheightborder  for a in xs     drawBarbob, a  wn.exitonclick codepre  pSo now that I have it this far, the if statement doesnt accurately reflect the height of the bar for each bar in the program, it seems to give almost random colors, but the colors are always grouped together which they shouldnt be. I need each bar to be a certain color based on its height, such as above 50 gets blue, less than 50 but equal or more than 30 yellow, everything else red.p

The tryfinally pattern with returns same idea as the old school goto with the cleanup label is one way. Another way would be to use an error object as a should proceed variable and do something likep  precodeif error      doStuffamperror  if error  [...] codepre  pThe addition of GCD complicates things a bit because now you have to make sure that the heavy work is being always done in the background and that errors are only ever reported in the main thread. Every APIs library does things a bit differently, so you have something like Facebook which only accepts blocks to be executed in main thread, which you have to interweave with Parse which allows you to run blocking calls if you wanted to.p  pIm wondering if anybody out there has come up with a cleaner approach. I feel like this is something most apps end up dealing with sooner or later and I dont need to reinvent the wheel.p

Negative 2754 pim using CKEditor to allow the user to input text into an asp page coded in c which outputs some bible texts, now i wanna add a function which lets the user to key in some kinda string which i will detect and replace with some text from the bible, for example, if i enter into the text editor as an example, with  as a special sequence of characters which i use to identify special codesstringsp  ptoday is a happy day, i learnt this 1 John 47. p  pthe codebehind should be able to detect the  in front and at the back of the 1 John 47 string, and be able to know that this can be looked up and uses the 1 John 47 string to look up a data structure Im thinking using a hash or dictionary or linked list the output on the page may be something like thisp  ptoday is a happy day, i learnt this Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God. p  pim able to get this done using a normal text box, but if we have a wysiwyg editor, there are alot of tags added in the background, and if i wanna add color to the string, itll complicate the string even more, since the editor may not highlight the whole string from the beginning  to the end of the  at the back. i may end up with a string like this the source of the text in the ckeditorp  pcodeltpgt ltspan classtext 1John47 idenKJ2130580gtltspan stylebackgroundcolor ffff00gtltspangtltstronggtltspan stylebackgroundcolor ffff00gt1 Joltugthn ltugtltemgt47ltemgtltspangtltstronggtltspan stylebackgroundcolor ffff00gtltspangtltspangtltpgtcodep  pso instead of a simple string like this 1 John 47 , we have a much longer string with a lot of formatting which is expected since i wanna be able to add text with formatting in the editor, and the word John and the  sequence is split up in between tags. because the string has been highlighted partially, in which case i should use the first color that appears, for the whole special string, or just ignore all tags in between the whole string for simplicity meaning the looked up text will only adopt the formatting that enclosed the  special string  code p  pitll be great if we can have the whole string 1 John 47 as an atomic string i mean as a continuous string that doesnt change in the editor, but this may not be the case, so i wanna ask, how should i go about doing this, so that i can allow the user to enter text freely in the editor, and yet have the asp page have the ability to detect that the user keyed in a special string  code which it can try to look up, when a sequence of special characters in this case  is used to enclose it.p  pThank you very much for reading and good day to you all.p

Ideally, Im looking for something that doesnt unduly burden developers, or require them to remember extra steps as they edit, build, test, and commit.

Negative 2754 pI realise this topic has been covered to death, and I have read the official and unofficial developer guides on it so know the theory.  But Im still unsure which path to take to ensure my app looks good on multiple screen sizes.  My app is a simple navigation style app which is designed to be portrait only.  At this stage Im not interested in making different designs for landscape or multipane screens for tablets etc.  I just want each screen to be scaled updown so it looks in proportion with the screen size it is being displayed on  i.e. text and images are sized updown as appropriate.  I designed the app for a classic 480x800 hdpi device which it looks great on, I just want to make it look in proportion for the Galaxy S3Nexus 7 etc.  Im already following these guidelines p  ul liUsing RelativeLayoutsli liUsing DP units for paddingmarginsli liUsing SP units for fontsli liUsing 9patch images for buttonsli ul  pHowever Im finding it still looks small and a bit lost in the middle of the screen on the larger devices.

Negative 2754 pOk so the question is simple. If i have 2 random bytes, say 150 a[0] and 215b[0] and i want to add them. obviously their sum wont fit in a byte so if i add them i will get an overflow.

I emcouldem use tensordot to do what I need, but my brain hurts when I think about having to replace fifty or so Einsten summations like the one above where the order of the indeces is very important with nested tensordot calls. Even more nightmarish is the though of having to debug that code and hunt for that one misplaced index swap.p  pLong story short, does anyone know why tensordot works with objects but einsum will not Any suggestions towards a workaround If not, any suggestions as to how I would go about writing my own wrapper to nested tensordot calls that is somewhat similar to the einsum notation numbers instead of letters are finep

Negative 2754 pIve got a Java Map object imported into a JSP file that Im working with. What I need to do is take each entry of that map and put it into a table in the JSP. Im not going to act like Im super knowledgeable about scriptlets, but from what I can tell theyre all evaluated before running and then placed into the code, which makes accessing the individual entries a challenge. Ive currently got it working by doing a toString on the map and then using regexs to parse out the info, but I want to do it more safely. p  pHow could this be achievedp

Negative 2754 pI have a peculiar problem with GCM it doesnt seem to send pushes to phones that are running on Android 4.2.2. I have eight phones that I test on, ranging from 2.2 to 4.2.2, and the one running 4.2.2 was not receiving pushes. We sent out the apk to some contacts who have 4.2.2 phones, and they were able to confirm that only on the 4.2.2 phones push failed. All in all, we tested our app on over 15 devices, five of which were on 4.2.2, and it was only those five that could not receive pushes. p  pThe devices that could not receive pushes werep  ul liSamsung Galaxy S4li liSamsung Galaxy Nexusli li2 x LG Nexus 4 li liA dev phone from the Razor M family li ul  pAfter investigating the logs, the phone is registering fine with the GCM servers, complete with a registration id. However, the onMessage just never gets triggered. Again, it works on all of our other phones which are not running 4.2.2. Im not sure what would cause this APIspecific behavior my target API is set to 17, which I believe is 4.2. p  pMy other suspicion is that because all of these phones that are running 4.2.2 are either not out on the market yet, or come factory unlocked, that might have to do with the issue. I havent been able to investigate this suspicion yet because 4.2.2 has not been rolled out by ATampT and TMobile yet, and Verizon just started doing incremental rollouts starting yesterday May 21. I dont really see how a 4.2.2 stock ROM could be the cause of GCM not working, however.p  pI tried doing some research on this issue, but nobody seems to be having any issues. All I get on SO and the google when I search for GCM and android 4.2.2 are issues with the new bluetooth stack and the shortened battery life with the update. I am pretty convinced I must be doing something wrong because other apps seem to send pushes no problem, but I am not sure where to start investigating. If somebody could point me in the right direction, it would be much appreciated.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong  So found out I had turned off logging on the server side by accident, so GCM actually does return an error on send. I get back a NotRegistered error on the 4.2.2 devices, even though the registration process on the client throws no errors and even returns a registration id. Again, pushes to devices not on Android 4.2.2 work fine. p

Negative 2754 pFirst of all, let me show you guys the equation in question.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAtaPY.png altCFL Equationp  pIn this equation S, V, and t are known constants. CFL is also known. We have an initial value for D, and we have no idea what k is.p  pWhat I need to do is find ideal values for both D and k that would minimize the residuals squared of a calculated CFL and a measured CFL. Using residuals squared is just a way for me to check if theyre the best possible values, but its fine if theres another way to go about this that uses some other method.p  pThe residual squared is just the absolute value of the difference between the calculated and measured CFLs, which is then squared. The lower the residual squared, the better the fit we have. So I need the smallest possible residual squared resulting from putting both k and D into the equation. Thatll result in a calculated CFL, which I can then compare to a measured CFL, allowing me to calculate the residual squared.p  pMy first idea for how to do this, since Im not sure how to use Excel equations, was to fix the value of D since we have an initial starting value to work from and then vary through different values of k, putting them into the equation to find a calculated CFL, and comparing that to the measured to find the residuals squared, until I find one that results with the smallest residuals squared. Then I fix k at that ideal value, and vary D until I find the smallest residual there as well. Then I fix D again, and go back to varying k. My idea was that I could keep bouncing back and forth like that until both D and k were within a certain percentage of their previous values. I assumed it would reach some sort of equilibrium with this methodp  pHowever, the numbers just go crazy, and end up either going to zero or going to infinity. So I need to rework my process. Which is where you guys come inp  pstrongHow would you go about finding the most ideal values for both D and k, which would result in a calculated CFL closest to the measured one, assuming you are given values for every variable above apart from k Remember to factor in that the value of D given initially is simply a starting place to work from, and is not the most ideal value.strongp  pIve been working on this program for a long time at least a month, and Im just stuck as hell and desperate.

While in the end, to the developer only yielding and handling the iterator is really interesting.p  pI would find it much more practical, to just define, where I want to handle the iteration.p  precodelet thirdfunc  function    let value  5   let other  yield 6  Change 1 incorporate yield   return value   let secondfunc  function    thirdfunc   let firstfunc  function    secondfunc   let gen  function   Change 2 at this level I want to deal with descendant yields    some code    more code   firstfunc    and code    Change 3 Handle iterator let it  gen while it.done     it.next  codepre  pIf the browser then has to turn everything between the codeyieldcode call and the generator handler codefirstfunccode, codesecondfunccode, codethirdfunccode into empromiseem  emfutureem form, that should work automagically and not be the business of Javascript developers.p  pOr are there really good arguments for not doing thisp

Negative 2754 pI have a Jackrabbit as standalone server. I have configured pool.OraclePersistenceManager to keep all my data in Oracle11. Data is moved to DB but still the filesystem directory , i.e.repository, is still there on the server filesystem. If I delete the repository directory from filesystem then I cannot get my documents. this is wierd. p  pI moved repo to Oracle DB to take periodic backups and to make it available for multiple jackrabbit instances residing on different server machines and only one server is active at a time. This I have done to prevent down time, if one server goes down the other jackrabbit instance is brought up and connected to the same DB instance.p  pOne more thing If repo data is truncated from the database then on restart of jackrabbit server data is again visible in DB. Is this the correct behaviour. I think if data file rows are deleted from DB then data should not be available in db even after restart of jackrabbit instance.p  pI want to eliminate data keeping in file system.p  pIt will be great if someone can describe the jackrabbit directory usage and db usage. And how they are related.p
Negative 2754 pBefore I go any further, let me just say, Ive already done everything thats recommended when you google slow joomla or optimize joomla. That is, my site is GZipped, all of my css and js are optimized and minified, Im not running any unnecessary components, plugins, or modules hardly any, in fact, my images are optimized, caching is turned on both page and Progressive and Im on supahfast cloud hosting from Rackspace, with my SQL Database on a separate Rackspace server.p  pAll of that, and Im still getting load times upwards of

Negative 2754 pIn my C Qt application a dictionary lookupquiz program I use plugins to provide functionality for all the possible lanugages somebody may want to add and use.

Later I found out from the docs for codeQPluginLoadercode that I wasnt supposed to do that. Besides, it also caused a weird bug which caused the program to freeze when closed but only after running under the debugger so there was something obviously wrong with it.p  pI removed the delete section from codeMainFormcode and everything seems to work fine, except that I noticed that the plugins destructors arent getting called. I relied on those for saving some pluginspecific settings at application termination, otherwise I wouldnt have noticed. I put a breakpoint on one of the destructors and the debugger never entered it.p  pHeres the outline of the pluginsp  precode dictplugin.h class DictionaryPlugin  public     virtual DictionaryPlugin       virtual QString name const  0     virtual QString language const  0      ...

How come the destructors are omitted Is there some other way that Im supposed to free them Perhaps keep the original codeQPluginLoadercode objects alive in the codeMainFormcode class and then codeunloadcode them manually in the destructor The destructors were also responsible for destroying some codeQDialogcodes and UI widgets the plugins own. Does this mean I have a leak when the program exitsp  pThanksp  pbUPDATEb I tried storing pointers to the codeQPluginLoadercodes for each plugin. In codeMainFormcode I iterate over them, calling codeunloadcode and codedeletecodeing them. Works fine, except the freeze bug is back. When I close the application, the window disappears, but the program keeps running in the debugger. I can pause it but the stack shows just some unidentified entry points in ntdll.dll. Nothing immediately bad seems to happen, and its not even visible when running normally, but somehow makes me uneasy.p  pbUPDATE2b I left the program running in the freeze state forgot to stop it and found out it terminated normally after a while it just took something like 20 seconds. Now Im absolutely amazed. What could cause thisp

Negative 2754 pI have a custom View that will manage hundreds of discrete userdefined sequential drawing events. Rather than maintaining a collection of all of the individual text, line, shape updates and then redrawing them all during each onDraw, I grab a Bitmap of the canvas at the end of each onDraw and then start the next onDraw with that Bitmap.  A description of my problem follows this snippetp  precodepublic class TestView extends View implements OnTouchListener      private Paint mPaint     private Bitmap mPrevCanvas     private int mTouchCount  0      float mX  50f     float mY  50f      public TestViewContext context          supercontext         setFocusabletrue         setFocusableInTouchModetrue               this.setOnTouchListenerthis         this.setDrawingCacheEnabledtrue          mPaint  new Paint         mPaint.setTextSize30f           Override     protected void onDrawCanvas canvas              if mTouchCount  0              canvas.drawTextTouch screen to begin, 50f, 100f, mPaint          else              if mPrevCanvas  null                  canvas.drawBitmapmPrevCanvas, 0, 0, mPaint                           canvas.drawTextInteger.toStringmTouchCount, mX, mY, mPaint             mPrevCanvas  getDrawingCache.copyBitmap.Config.ARGB8888, false                    public boolean onTouchView arg0, MotionEvent event          if event.getAction  MotionEvent.ACTIONUP              mX  event.getX             mY  event.getY             mTouchCount  1             invalidate                  return true       codepre  pIt seems to be working okay for the first touch event, but then mPrevCanvas never gets updated again.  In reviewing the previous questions related to getDrawingCache, only  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11055133getDrawingCache is not updateda seemed relevant, but based on that users selfdiscovered answer, that apparently wasnt the same problem.p  pWhen running this custom view, touching the screen displays a 1 at the position you touch.  It then captures a Bitmap of the canvas with that 1 in it.  Subsequent touches redisplay that Bitmap stored in mPrevCanvas showing the 1 again at the same position, and then the new number representing the current touch event e.g., 2, 3, etc.  Since Im refreshing mPrevCanvas at the end of each onDraw, I expect each onDraw to begin by displaying a Bitmap containing the results of all of the previous touch events... but for some reason the mPrevCanvas Bitmap is never updated to include that anything except that initial event 1.p  pIve a verified that isDrawingCacheEnabled is still true during each pass through onDraw b tried throwing in destroyDrawingCache and buildDrawingCache to no avail c forced mPrevCanvas to null before the call to getDrawingCache to make sure its really getting updated and d searched through my copy of OReillys Java in a Nutshell on the hunch that maybe I have a java headspace problem rather than an Android API problem.p  pQ1 Why will getDrawingCache only return a Bitmap containing that emfirstem call to canvas.drawText, but never with the results of any of the subsequent drawText callsp  pQ2 Given that Im doing it this way for resource efficiency, should I be using some other design pattern anywayp

I have observed that If I set the timeout for ping to a lower value, for example, 750ms, it is working but if i use the default timeout for ping, that is, 5sec, then it does not work some pings are cancelled and when trying to serve them they are returning empty responseText that cause it to crash when trying to parse in ajax callback.p

Negative 2754 pIve searched loads for an answer to my problem.p  pBasically on my WP8 app, I have an add record page and a list of text boxes. I can scroll up and down the full length of the page fine, but when I tap one of the text boxes and the keyboard appears, I can no longer scroll to the very bottom and therefore cant complete the last couple text boxes.p  pNow, if you have a look at the MS calendar app on WP8, the new appointment page has a similar thing  when you tap one of the text boxes you can still scroll the whole way up and down.p  pI was wondering, is there anywhere I can see the XAML that MS have used Then I can learn from that. Im sure its as simple as setting a height property or something but Ive been stumped on this for a while now.p  pRather than posting my XAML etc, does anyone know where I can get a look at the XAML for the MS stock apps If this is even possible...p  pThanksp
Negative 2754 pI have some view controllers in a form sheet and right now they all push segue. But I want to make an animation that makes them come from right to left during segue throughout the page. so when I go to the next view controller my segue should start bringing the view controller from the right and the parent view controller starts to move to the left and goes off the screenfades and the child view controller comes from right and settles at the center of the iPad like how form sheets do. I was wondering if anyone had implemented something like that before if not, can I get some suggestions in how to do this so that I can get a head start I have just have a little experience with custom segues, where I could use QuartzCore to animate the view controllers and since they all belong to the same navigation controller I am not sure how can I achieve this fly from right to center and to left animation.p

Negative 2754 pMy objective was to create a basic app with google maps loaded inside it. I used the demo of sample maps to edit my xml, manifest and javaactiviy files. I created an api key using my SHA1 and also included its reference in the manifest. I also gave permissions for internet, opengl usage in the manifest. I am using Maps v2. I tried it on an Xperia Arc S and Google Nexus 4 and got different results in both. In the Arc S the app loads with no map but white screen with google logo and zoom in zoom out buttons. The screen flickers constantly. But in the Nexus 4 there is no flickering but all of the same as above. Please I need help as i am not able to load a map inside an app.p

Negative 2754 pId like to generate thumbnails from various document file formats such as odt, docx and pptx but also mp4, psd, tiff and possibly others from a Python application. As far as I know for each of these formats there is at least one open source application which can generate preview imagesthumbnails e.g. LibreOffice, ffmpeg or at least extract embedded thumbnails e.g. imagemagick.p  pMy main problem is that each of these applicationslibraries use different command line options so Im looking for a Python library or a unified CLI tool which provides a highlevel API to generate a thumbnail with specified dimensions, quality level given a filename and calls the appropriate external tool ideally including catching exceptions, segfaults and timeouts. Bonus points if it can generate multiple thumbnails if requested e.g. one per page, page XY, every Z seconds but at most N images.p  pDoes anyone know such a libraryutility Boundary condition The files may contain sensitive material or might be quite big so this must work without any network communication, using an external web service is not possible.p  pIf there is no such thing in Python, a locally installable web service would be fine as well.p

Negative 2754 pHi I am writing an email that has 2 attachments, one is another email amp a text document. Everything works as expected after a few hours of research I cannot seem to fix one problem. p  pOk, so I know that Outlook which is the program that the email will be opened in stores its emails using a .eml extension. After all the email building I write the attachment email to a tmp file like this.p  precode            msg.writeTonew FileOutputStreamnew FiletmpcontactName.eml codepre  pMy goal was to create a draft like email where once you open it all fields like To, CC, Bcc, and subject are already available and editable. If I write it this way the only way to edit those fields is to open the attachment email and hit replyall. This extra step also includes deleting the text that gets generated like.p  pFrom eolnotificationniksun.com [mailtoeolnotificationcompany.com] p  pSent Saturday, February 08, 2014 411 PMp  pSubject NOTICE of End of Life Company products within 90 Daysp  pSo I figured out that instead of .eml I should use .msg.

Negative 2754 pmy first post here [so please excuse the eventual formattingformulationetc issues]. I am writing a raw H.264 to a mpeg 2 transport stream transcoder changing the container only, no video transcoding per se involved. I emthinkem I understand the mpeg 2 transport stream spec H.222.0 but I cannot get QuickTime to playback the resulting .ts files VLC and FFMPEG play back fine. What Im doing p  ol licreate PAT with program map pid 53li licreate PMT with pid 53 for PCR PID 70li lisplit the raw NALUs into PES packets with PID 70  add an adaptation field with stuffing bytes in case the PES is less then 184 bytes longli ol  pI have two almost identical files  one of them is two frames .ts file dumped out by VLC, the other one is the two frames .ts file dumped by VLC transcoded to raw H.264 that in turn is transcoded to .ts again with my tool. The differences are minimal, but for the life in me, QuickTime plays back only the original VLC .ts, not my transcoded one. I am using tsreport from a hrefhttptstools.berlios.de relnofollowhttptstools.berlios.dea to report the various .ts file structures and they look almost identical.

Negative 2754 pI am working on a project that has an ASP.NET Web API service accepting a DateTime value from a Angular client using the AngularStrap date picker.

However, the client is converting this from UTC back to the local time zone causing the date that is displayed to the user to get shifted one day into the future.p  pHow can I get around the UTC conversion when I really dont care around the time  Should I return a preconverted date value from the server relative to the users time zone  Is there someway to ignore the time component all togetherp

I am now waiting for MSs answer.p  pI do not think that it is normal to peek into something that is supposed to be a blackbox and speculate. Therefore, my objections are based on what the contract says lpFileName [in] The directory or path, and the file name, which can include wildcard characters, for example, an asterisk  or a question mark .  I am not a native English speaker. Maybe it means these are not the only wildcards, maybe not. However, if these are not the only wildcards, they should have listed all maybe they will. At this point, I think the MSs resolution will be By Design or Wont fix.p  pRegarding stat, which I think it is an ISO function, MSDN says Return value Each of these functions returns 0 if the filestatus information is obtained. It does not say a thing about the wildcards, documented or not. I do not see what kind of information stat may retrieve from ctemp or ctemp. It is highly unlikely that someone is relying on current behavior, so they may issue a fix.p  pstrongEdit 3strongp  pMicrosoft has closed the stat bug as Fixed.p  p... We have fixed this for the next major release of Visual Studio this will be Visual Studio 14, but note that the fix is not present in the Visual Studio 14 CTP that was released last week. In Visual Studio 14, the stat functions now use CreateFile to query existence and properties of a path. The change to use CreateFile was done to work around other quirks related to file permissions that were present in the old FindFirstFilebased implementation, but the change has also resolved this issue. ...p

Negative 2754 pI am aware that similar questions have been posted on this site many times before, HOWEVER, my question is not how I can showhide menu items in different fragments. I got that down. The problem is there is a delay between swiping fragments and the new menu items showing or hiding. This delay really detracts from the interface. The changes in the action bar menu items should be immediate, amongst other reasons, to avoid clicking certain menu items in the wrong fragment. p  pSo question is, stronghow can i change the menu items in the actionbar immediately when the user begins swiping the fragment to go to the nextstrongp  pI know its possible because various applications already do this.  I am currently overriding the onPrepareOptionsMenu method in every fragment and telling it which items to show and which to hide. I use supportInvalidateOptionsMenu method to prompt the changing of the menu items, but the lag is still too long and evident.p  pI am open to changing the structuretechnique of my changing of the menu items in the fragment strongin order to achieve an IMMEDIATE change in the menu times as soon as the swiping begins.strongp  pPlease help. Thanksp

Negative 2754 pWe are currently using JOOQ in our project to interact with Orcale DB. Now there is a requirement where we need to create a process monitoring app which will monitor a set of backend processes. We build a java app which spwan threads for each processes and monitor its status and also logs into a table if anything goes wrong.p  pBut the above process is failing with multiple thread environment. i.e if we try to start all the processes at the same time it throws an error showing protocol violation. We are suspecting it may be due the fact that we are using single database connectionsingleton scope for all the processes.p  pCan anyone help us in implementing connection pool supported by JOOQ which may resolve the issue Any other suggestions are also welcomed.p  pThanks, Pankajp

Negative 2754 pIm currently refactoring a chunk of code that pretty much goes like thisp  precodepublic static void mainString... args      while true           Do something...         Thread.sleep300000  Every 5 minutes       codepre  pThe idea is that I want to use a codeScheduledExecutorServicecode to do the running of the codep  precodepublic static void mainString... args      ScheduledExecutorService service  Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor     service.scheduleAtFixedRatenew Task..., 0, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES  codepre  pThere are a few concerns that I have with this, though firstly, the fact that the program terminates as in codemaincode returns after scheduling, but the JVM is kept alive because the codeScheduledExecutorServicecode remains running.  I believe that this is intentional, in order to maintain the old codes behavior of keep running until terminated from the outside, but I believe that I would have to install a shutdown hook to ensure that the codeScheduledExecutorServicecode shuts down properly.  Will that actually be the case, or will killed from the outside also prevent execution of the shutdown hookp  pSecondly, Im also squeamish about having a shutdown hook in the first place.  If I had code likep  precodetry      while true   finally       Shutdown hook code goes here instead     service.shutdown     if service.awaitTermination1, TimeUnit.SECONDS          service.shutdownNow       codepre  pwill the same killed from the outside concern as above still existp  pEDIT Yes, the original program loops through without ever breaking through the loop it was only meant to be terminated from, say, SIGINT controlC in a terminal.  It is a rather poorlydefined termination condition, but that is the only thing that I have right now...p

I was thinking of dichotomic search but Im not sure about it.p  pI had two solutions p  pstrongSolution 1 strongp  pThat arraydictionary will contain about 70.000 words, sorted alphabetically. I browse the array from start to end until I reach my match.p  pThis will probably be stupidly slow, specifically if my word starts with a Z.p  pstrongSolution 2 strongp  pI have an array codeallTheWordscode that contains 27 arrays A, B, C, and so on. Each array contains every word starting with that letter.p  pI check the first letter of my given string, and go browse my array from start to end until I reach my match. That would be drastically faster than solution 1 so, I feel like Im one step ahead but that its still non optimal.p  pIs this viable Do you know something better Am I on the right path p  pNote  I have zero code about this, Im still on the papertheoretical side of the app here, only pseudo code and little drawings.p

The External and Internal contains a lot of controls like EditTexts, RadioButtons, etc.p  pThe information or data is not saved immediately and sometimes is not even saved not needed to. This is because there are a lot of times that the user captures some data in tab 1 and then switches to tab 3, then to tab 2, and again to tab 1, and so on. And as I said, occasionally is only for getting some quick information calculated in the tab 1 Summary which is not useful for saving.p  pThats the reason the data dont need to be destroyed when changing tabs, hence the use of Hide and Show.p  pI know I can temporarily store the information using a variety of methods, but it is really a lot of information like around 180 variables in tab 3 for giving an example. The most practical and easy way I have come is to avoid recreating the Fragments.p  pAnyway, with this information in mind, could I get some advice on how I can avoid the overlapping and at the same time retain the information stored in those Fragments when switching through themp  pI really appreciate the help, thanks in advancep

Negative 2754 pIn iOS8, when the launch images are specified using a storyboard, I have found that iPhoneonly apps do not scale everything correctly.

I then override the a hrefhttpsgithub.comcoleiferpeeweeblobmasterpeewee.pyL3546L3565 relnofollowpeewee save methoda to not only save the codePersoncode object, but also copy all attributes into a codePersonRevisioncode object and save that as well.

Negative 2754 pDear SAP Stack Overflow Community,p  pWe are running a website where users need to be authenticated from the Portal.p  pScenario User logs in into SAP portal via SAML Authentication. This user can view a link in the Portal he can click the link and will be transferred to a website on another domain. This domain will receive the a ticket and the user will be able to login.p  pInformation from a friend If you have a setup that uses SAML, there are mechanisms to transfer that session between domains that basically rely on passing a ticket through the URL to the client from the authentication server, and that ticket is then passed to the site you want to authenticate against, which can use that to establish the identity of the user with the authentication server and establish the session.p  pQuestion Is this possible in SAP, if so can anyone provide me some documentation for thisp

Negative 2754 pI would like to keep the original file name of an codeUploadedFilecode in Django that has its location stored in a codeFileFieldcode. Right now I am observing that if two files have the same name, the first file uploaded keeps its original name but the second time a file with that name is uploaded, it has a random string appended to make the file name unique. One solution is to add an additional field to the model a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10905674djangohowtosaveoriginalfilenameinfilefieldDjango How to save original filename in FileFielda or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17355888savingoriginalfilenameindjangowithfilefieldSaving Original File Name in Django with FileFielda but these solutions seem suboptimal as they require changing the codeModelcode fields. p  pAn alternative would be to prepend a random directory path to the front of the file make sure that in a given directory the file name is unique and allowing the codebasenamecode to remain unchanged. One way to do this would be to pass in a callable codeuploadtocode that does just that. Another option would be to subclass codeFileFieldcode and override codegetfilenamecode to not strip the input filename to the codebasenamecode allowing the caller to pass in a filename with a prepended path. The latter option is not ideal if I want to use an codeImageFieldcode as I would have to subclass that as well. p

I have heard this can be done with MagickWand libraries, but I havent been able to find a concrete example yet.p  pI have also had a look at OpenCV, but it seems that a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgmodulesphotodocinpainting.html relnofollowOpenCVs inpaint methoda accept only 8bitperchannel images, while I must preserve the 16. Is there any other library, or even an interesting code snippet I am not aware of Any help is appreciated.p  pSamplesp  pFull Picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7YQ8j.jpg altFull Picturep  pIR Channelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvTkkZ.jpg altIR Channelp  pDust and scratch mask p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com48wad.jpg altThe Maskp  pWhat I want to remove automaticallyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYMUke.jpg altTo be removedp  pWhat I consider too large to remove with no user interventionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comosT9A.jpg altTo be removed manuallyp  pYou can also download the original TIFF file a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu1464091pa.tif relnofollowherea.

My problem is is that the applications are being scaled up making them look very blurry.p  pNow if I turn my resolution to 2560x1600 so that nothing scales the app looks fine.

In Eclipse i added the folder via Project  New  General  Folder  Linked to alternate Folder, so i am able to see and browse the files through the subfolders.p  pBut when i try to build the Project it does not include the folder and subfolder in the compile process. I then tried to add it as explicit Source folder via Project  New  CC  Source Folder. The Dialog gives an error invalid project path duplicate path entries. I think because in the C Path and Smybols properties my project root folder is set. Even when i add the myPorjectshared path, it is still not included in the compile process. The New Source Folder then gives me an error Entry already exists, so it is set up as source folder.p  pI then tried copy pasting the folder for testing purpose into my Eclpise project folder and it is working.

Negative 2754 pI am trying to find a good example of how to do a ForEach to take a List and convert it to XML. The reason I want to do a ForEach is because I can do a trycatch on each item and make sure I process all the roads before they fail.

If it does fail, now with it being a ForEach, I now have the ability to make the XML document no matter what and also log what column fails and what row ie what persons name it failed on. Then I can check the actual excel file and fix the issue and reupload just that record. p  pAny help would be appreciate it.

Negative 2754 pI just started learning angularjs. I followed a course that discusses all the major concepts and terms in angularjs. The next thing I want to do is to plan out how to use the angularjs concepts to rebuild my chessapplication that I have built without angular managing the UI was a mess to do manually so I want to use angular for that.p  pstrongMy applicationusecasestrongp  pA chess application where users can play chess against eachother over the internet or single player. The application includes rule checking to prevent invalid moves, user management, finding opponents to play against, playing multiple simultaneous games, etc.p  pstrongComponents that I had in my nonangular projectstrongp  ul liA codeChessEnginecode object which manages the gamestate. It contains the board representation and it offers functions like codesetupBoardboardPositioncode, codeisValidMovemovecode, codegetValidMovesForPiececoordinatecode, codemakeMovemovecode etc.li lia codeLocalGamecode object which wraps around the codeChessEnginecode which is the API for playing chess locally not over the internet. For single player games this is where the UI interacts with.li liA codeGameNetworkManagercode object which can persist moves or games to the server. It offers functions like codestoreGame...code, codeloadGamegameIdcode, codestoreMovegameId, moveIdcodeli liA codeNetworkGamecode object which wraps around a codeLocalGamecode object and a codeGameNetworkManagercode object. It has nearly the same API as the codeLocalGamecode object. It uses the codeLocalGamecode object to manage the game, but it also persists the moves to the server. It also waits for the opponents move by regurally checking the server instead of asking the AI for a new move.li liother required objects such as codeUserManagercode with functions like coderegisterUsercode, codedeleteUsercode, codegetGameListuserIdcode.li licodeBoardViewcode object that shows the board and allows for binding UI events on that board to functions of the other components.li licodeGameViewcode object that shows the game page the codeBoardViewcode, the player names, the move notations, etc.li ul  pstrongMapping from components abovestrongp  pI find it difficult, even after following tutorials, to determine how to map the above components to angular concepts. I also have doubts on whether I should use angularjs only for the UI part or also for the codeChessEnginecode itself. In the example described above, what should be put in controllersservicesdirectivesetc. I suppose you can make a service that, based on a given gamestate and move can tell whether the move is valid, but I am having troubles to see how all the angular concepts can be used together to form the entire application.p  pAlso I already have the codeChessEnginecode ready. Can I use angular JS to build the UI that uses the ChessEngine or does this make things difficult I guess its possible by just doing codescopegtchessEngine new ChessEnginecode in the controller which grants access to the functionality and properties of the ChessEngine object. But where does the LocalGame, NetworkGame object, etc. gop  pI hope you can give me some hints on this, doesnt have to be detailed just a description of how you would structure such an application in big lines.p

However the state of the container is modified. Is it counterintuitive Should I try to give the strong exception guarantee to codeItemsContainerenablecode by disabling the already enabled items in case of failure and keeping initial state unchangedpli lipIn codeItemsContainerenabledcode, are the assertions reasonable Since I dont have the control on codeItemcode and no exception guarantee is documented, it could occur that the instructions codemenabled  truecode and codenotifyobserverscode are swapped. In this case, codeItemsContainerenablecode could break the internal state of the container.pli ol  pIt is not the first time I face such a situation. strongAre there best practice rulesstrongp  pNB emI reduced the code sample to the minimum, but in fact, codeItemenablecode is a setter codeItemsetenabledboolcode and I want to implement the same thing for codeItemsContainercode.

Negative 2754 pI have a RESTful webservice running on Amazon EC2. Since my application needs to deal with large number of photos, I plan to put them on Amazon S3. So the URL for retrieving a photo from S3 could look like thisp  precodehttpjohnsmith.s3.amazonaws.comphotospuppy.jpg codepre  pIs there any way or necessity to cache the images on EC2 The pros and cons I can think of is 1 Reduced S3 usage and cost with improved image fetching performance. However on the other hand EC2 cost can rise plus EC2 may not have the capability to handle the image cache due to bandwidth restrictions. 2 Increased development complexity cuz you need to check the cache first and ask S3 to transfer the image to EC2 and then transfer to the client.p  pIm using the EC2 micro instance and feel it might be better not to do the image cache on EC2. But the scale might grow fast and eventually will need a image cache.Am I right If cache is needed, is it better to do it on EC2, or on S3 Is there a way for caching for S3p  pBy the way, when the client uploads an image, should it be uploaded to EC2 or S3 directly p

As stated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23467994errorsmanagingtheunityplayerlifecycleinanativeandroidapplicationherea, mUnityPlayer.quit completely kills the process it is running in. So basically what happens is that the entire app exits when I switch fragments i.e., switch tabs in the NavigationDrawer, because that calls the onDestroy of the UnityPlayerNativeFragment.p  pI do NOT want this. Ideally, the user would switch to another tab in the NavigationDrawer, and when heshe comes back to the tab of the Unity scene, it is exactly where heshe left it. As though they used the Android multitasking to change apps and return  nothing changes.p  pIf this were an Activity, it would be possible to open it in a different process than the main app by adding the codeandroidprocessUnityKillsMecode line in the Manifest file, but this isnt possible for a fragment. So, my questionsp  ol liHow can I open the UnityPlayerNativeFragment in a new process, so that the .quit function doesnt kill my entire app, and so that I can relaunch the fragment when the user leaves the tab and then returns to itli liEven if I can achieve Q1, there remains the issue of state. Quitting and then reloading the Unity scene will recreate it anew, starting from the default view, and losing any properties it had e.g. imagine it was a game, then all the data would be lost. So question 2 is how can I switch to another tab in the same app, then return to the Unity tab, without having the scene change at all Essentially, keeping it running in the background without quitting it at all.li ol  pHeres how Im switching fragments from the MainActivityp  precodeOverride     public void onNavigationDrawerItemSelectedint position           update the main content by replacing fragments         FragmentManager fragmentManager  getFragmentManager         if position3              fragmentManager.beginTransaction                     .replaceR.id.container, DirectoryFragment.newInstanceposition  1                     .commit                  else if position  0              upnf  UnityPlayerNativeFragment.newInstanceposition  1             fragmentManager.beginTransaction                     .replaceR.id.container, upnf, UnityPlayerNativeFragment                     .commit                  else if position  2             fragmentManager.beginTransaction                     .replaceR.id.container, WeatherFragment.newInstanceposition  1                     .commit                  else if position  4              fragmentManager.beginTransaction                     .replaceR.id.container, SettingsFragment.newInstanceposition  1                     .commit             Log.dworked pos4,worked pos4                  else             fragmentManager.beginTransaction                     .replaceR.id.container, PlaceholderFragment.newInstanceposition  1                     .commit               codepre

Negative 2754 pMy background in programming MCUs is limited due to this being my first year.

Do they use assembly or a much lowerlevel language that they possibly wrote themselvesp  pSecond part of this question what is the limit on highlevel languages before it becomes stupid to use i.e does programming a microcontroller in python give a massive disadvantage over the more favoured assemblyCp

Negative 2754 pI am trying to implement wakeup radio feature for wireless sensor networks using Cooja. Since, I am new to Cooja, does anyone have done this before or has any idea how to implement it in Cooja as a plugin. p  pWakeup radio WuR is basically a secondary radio attached to the main mote and can be inband or outof band radio. This WuR is a very low power nA device and can be kept on for the full time and will monitor the channel. Upon valid data to be transferred,it will send a wakeup call to the other wakeup receiver which will then wake up the main mote via interrupt pin. p  pIt will be really helpful if anyone can provide some guidelines as how to implement this secondary radio.p

Negative 2754 pI am working to play some voice messages from iPhone to car bluetooth audio and are testing with Lexus RX350, which supports A2DP and HFP. In our case, A2DP is preferred. However, I can only hear the sound when car is using bluetooth as audio source. When listening to CD or radio, no sound from iPhone is actually played over car audio system.  So, what I want to do isp  ol liUse A2DP when bluetooth is the active audio sourcebrli liOtherwise use HFPli ol  pI use AVAudioPlayer to play audio with AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback as audio session category. It will always succeed as long as the bluetooth connection is established, no matter whether the car audio is on radio, CD or bluetooth. There is no route change notification when switch between audio sources, therefore I dont know when we shall switch to HFP. Any suggestionsp  pBtw, music players like Spotify, Pandora, will pause when switch away from bluetooth audio and resume when switch back, Google Maps will use A2DP when bluetooth audio is active and use HFP if not, so I think there should be a way to detect the changep

Negative 2754 pI am using a hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackageslinq2db relnofollowcodelinq2dbcodea and while it works well enough for most CRUD operations I have encountered many expressions that it just cannot translate into SQL.p  pIt has gotten to the point where unless I know in advance exactly what kinds of expressions will be involved and have successfully invoked them before, I am worried that any benefit derived from codelinq2dbcode will be outweighed by the cost of trying to find and then remove or move away from the server side the offending expressions.p  pIf I knew how to tell codelinq2dbcode how to parse an codeExpressionltFuncltT,out Tgtgtcode or whatnot into SQL whenever on an adhoc, asitisneeded basis, then I would be much more confident and I could do many things using this tool.p  pTake, for instance, codeString.Splitchar separatorcode, the method that takes a codestringcode and a codecharcode to return a codestring[]code of each substring between the separator.p  pSuppose my table codeEquipmentcode has a nullable codevarcharcode field codeUsagescode that contains lists of different equipment usages separated by commas.p  pI need to implement codeIListltstringgt GetUsagesstring tenantCode, string needle  nullcode that will give provide a list of usages for a given tenant code and optional search string.p  pMy query would then be something likep  precodevar listOfListOfStringUsages      from et in MyConnection.GetTableltEquipmentTenantgt     join e in MyConnection.GetTableltEquipmentgt on et.EquipmentId  e.EquipmentId     where et.TenantCode  tenantCode     where e.Usages  null     select e.Usages.Split,  cannot convert to sql here  var flattenedListOfStringUsages       listOfListOfStringUsages.SelectManystrsToAdd gt strsToAdd                             .Selectstr gt str.Trim                             .Distinct  var list  flattenedListOfStringUsages.ToList codepre  pHowever, it  would actually bomb out at runtime on the line indicated by comment.p  pI totally get that codelinq2dbcodes creators cannot possibly be expected to ship with every combination of codestringcode method and major database package.p  pAt the same time I feel as though could totally tell it how to handle this if I could just see an example of doing just that someone implementing a custom expression.p  pSo my question is stronghowstrong do I instruct codelinq2dbcode on how to parse an codeExpressioncode that it cannot parse out of the boxp

Negative 2754 pIs there any way to be notified automatically if some view controller is presented modally on top of another view controller other than codeviewWillDisappearcode, which is obviously not called for nonfullscreen modal presentation on iPadp  pBackgrounduse case In an iPad app, whenever a modal form sheet is presented, I want to adjust the appearance of the view behind the modal. However, the presentation if the modals is not necessarily done in the same view controller that needs to adapt, but can rather happen in some child or parent VCs. Of course, I could just communicate this event manually via notification, delegation or whatever, but thats quite repetitive and can easily be forgotten when adding further modal form sheets in the future.p  pThus, Im wondering if there is any more elegant way to achieve this.

Since this input data does not contain data for my other columns, OtherColumn,OtherColumn2 etc., I just want to make them empty. Since I have compiled my input data into lists each effectively holding a column of data, I am zipping them into the order I want them in my template.p  pFor the empty columns, I am having to feed my template an empty list for each one, codeempty,empty,empty,empty,empty,emptycode, in my zip iteration.  Is there a better way to do this Can I just say  empty 5 times instead of codeempty,empty,empty,empty,empty,emptycode.  p  pMy output is the same either way, I just know my method of going about this is poor practice and would like to clean up my code.

Negative 2754 pIm finally admitting defeat and asking for help. Ive done everything I can think of to solve this problem, but it seems Im incapable of doing it.p  pIm working with VS2010 C Oracle 12c ODP.Net Managed121012p  pI have inherited an app that uses both the managed and unmanaged dataaccess dll. It was working until I deinstalled oracle. I then reinstalled the 11g client for a 64bit machine. Right away I noticed that there was only dataaccess dll for framework 2 installed, but I continued anyway. I then copied all the oci and ora dlls from the client1 folder into the bin directory of my app as well as the Oracle.DataAccess.dll into my bin directory too. I also copied Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.dll into this folder.p  pMy application ran successfully as long as I didnt change anything on my datasets. I would have happily carried on like this, except I have to create more datasets. When I tried to add a new dataset, my data source connection wizard drop down list was blank. Then I tried to recreate the connections, but could only see the .Net Framework DProviders. I could not see the managed provider. At some point I also got this error no data provider is currently selected.p  pThinking its because the managed provider wasnt installed I uninstalled the 11g client and installed the 64bit 12c client and copied all the relevant files into the bin of my app. I added the following lines to my app.config filep  precode      ltconfigSectionsgt     ltsection nameoracle.manageddataaccess.client typeOracleInternal.Common.ODPMSectionHandler, Oracle.ManagedDataAccess gt codepre  pp  precode  ltsystem.datagt ltDbProviderFactoriesgt   ltremove invariantOracle.DataAccess.Client gt   ltremove invariantOracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client gt   ltadd nameODP.NET, Managed Driver invariantOracle.DataAccess.Client          descriptionOracle Data Provider for .NET, Managed Driver          typeOracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory, Oracle.ManagedDataAccess, Version4.121.1.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken89b483f429c47342 gt      ltDbProviderFactoriesgt codepre  pp  pAfter this I can now see some of the old data sources, but I cant connect to my database because I get a Connection Request Timed out. When I manually creating a new connection, I can connect fine with the unmanaged provider, but get a connection request timed out error. p  pIm really at the end of my rope and would really appreciate fresh eyes before I use the rope.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2754 pIm observing extremely weird iOS 8.3 swift app behaviour. My app leverages ios keychain to store an user password.

Any other key works as expected. The problem happens only on devices whereas simulator works correct. The option of the damaged keychain I eliminated because it see the same more than on one device. p

Negative 2754 pI have a system where I can only read 50 columns worth of data from a table at a time. The table has 150 columns that I need to read. The table has 1 million lines.p  pWhat I have been doing so far is to read the 1st 50 columns and write all 1 millions lines to a text file.p  pWhat I need to do next, is read next block of 50 columns and append lines 1 to 1 million into the existing text file that I have already written to.p  pThis is where I become stuck.

Negative 2754 pWe have two queues for two different tasks in Celery. One of these queues has tasks which will require an instance to be started in the autoscaling group. In the first autoscaling group which handles one kind of tasks, we always have one instance running. It is then easy to start another instance using Amazon CloudWatch. But for the other autoscaling group we dont want it to have any instances if there are no tasks because many a time there might not be tasks to be performed by this group. So only if the length of the Celery queue for this task goes above a given threshold, we want to start an instance in this autoscaling group. What would be a good way to do thisp

Negative 2754 pI am developing a twitter based app and showing tweets as an item in recycler view. I have an imageview in the item layout, which is shown only if a tweet also have an image associated with it. Im doing this by setting imageview visibility as GONE in xml and if a image url is present, I set the imageview visibility to VISIBLE in onBindView.p  pI want the imageview height to be dynamic, so I set its height to wrap content. But when the list is shown, it looks like the images appear out of nowhere and on scrolling some othe issues appear like when the scrolling speed is fast then the imageview is showing some other image which is replaced the correct image after some time and this change is quite noticeable. So, right now Im using a fixed height on my imageview which scale down the image, in short not filling the imageview. The problem with this, is that if image height is less than specified height in xml, then a lot of whitespace above and below the imageview appears .I want the image appearing in the list item to be as big as possible without any issues mentioned.

I want that, when  user clicks the codebuttoncode the entire cell is added to a different favourite table view controller class, which can be accessed from the Favourite tab. Just like in stock iphone Phone app. When the user adds a contact to favorites it is visible under the favourite tab. How can i achieve this in swift  Please guide me and point me in the right direction.p  pI was thinking of something like, adding the cell data to a different core data model on the click of the codebuttoncode. Then using this model to populate the cells in favourite table view controller class. But i am new to swift and dont know how to implement this idea. Any kind of help will be much appreciated. p
Negative 2754 pIm trying to expand a UITableViewCell via an expand button on the cell that expands the current cell if its not already expanded, closes it if it is, and closes the currently expanded cell and expands another if a second cells expand button is clicked while one is already expanded. p  pThis is a prototype cell, itll be on every cell in the UITableView. Im easily able to do this by clicking on the cell itself and using didSelectRowAtIndexPath, but since Im using a button, I cant set the IBAction in the TableViewController class, I must do it in the Cell class. I get a The expandButton outlet from the TableViewController to the UIButton is invalid. Outlets cannot be connected to repeating content error if I attach a button in the cell to the TableViewController class and therefore must move it to the Cell class.p  pI have tried a huge number of ways to do this and wouldnt be able to list them all here if I tried. Suffice it to say that most of the methods Ive come across assume that youre able to access the tableView properties from the Cell class, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29565758uitableviewhowtochangecellheightdynamicallywhenabuttonisclickedinithisa question, which my code currently somewhat resembles but with a few modifications. p  pI have attempted placing reloadData and reloadRowsAtIndexPaths in several places in my code and am unable to make the cells expand instantly on button click with any combination. I have attempted calling a function I created in the TableViewController class by clicking the button defined in the Cell class, and reloading the cell in that function, and I get an unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an optional value error.p  pMy current code is a hrefhttppastebin.comR6RqzkyY relnofollowherea with comments. Currently the error I receive is an unexpected nil error on line 21 of my pastebin. How can I cause the expand button to immediately change the height of the cell on click p  pIm using Swift 2 and Xcode 7 beta 6. Please dont just tell me to use a certain method, because I may not know where to use it. p

Negative 2754 pIve ready through tons forum posts and Ask Tom pages and cant seem to find anything that works so Im hoping you can help me out.  I have a table Ive created that has hierarchical data.  I have the parent part number, parent price, child part number, child price, child quantity, level in the hierarchy.p  pParent price always takes precedence over the sum of children  however I need to backfill where we have gaps.  This is built from a root arrangement number so all level 1s are considered top level arrangements with a quantity of 1 that I need to roll up to.p  pI have two problems. 1  If the parent part number has a price and is also a component I need parent price x cmpnt qty to get total price 2  If the parent price is missing and allany of the children have a price I need to backfill the parent price with this calculation.  If only some of the children have a price I need to keep going further down the tree until I can backfill the parent.p  pI wrote a query but it sums all levels and my numbers where huge.  I need to stop once Ive successfully backfilled a level.p  pThis is on Oracle 12C Enterprise.p  pHere is my test tablep  precodeDROP TABLE costrollup  CREATE TABLE costrollup   parentno VARCHAR2 4 BYTE,  parentprc NUMBER,  childno VARCHAR2 4 BYTE,  childprc NUMBER,  childqty NUMBER,  level NUMBER  codepre  pMy datap  precodeINSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A1,NULL, 2A1, 0.35, 4, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A1, NULL, 2A2, 1, 2, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A1, NULL, 2A3, 1.25, 1, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A2, 3, 2A4, 0.27, 1, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A2, 3, 2A5, 0.3, 2, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A3, NULL, 2A6, 25, 1, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A3, NULL, 2A7, 2, 2, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A4, NULL, 2A8, NULL, 2, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 2A8, NULL, 3A1, 3, 1, 2  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 2A8, NULL, 3A2, 2, 2, 2  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A5, NULL, 2A9, 0.5, 4, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 1A5, NULL, 2A10, NULL, 1, 1  INSERT INTO costrollup  VALUES 2A10, NULL, 3A3, 2, 5, 2   COMMIT codepre  pOutput     Select  from costrollupp  precodePARENTNO   PARENTPRC  CHILDNO    CHILDPRC   CHILDQTY   LEVEL 1A1                     2A1          0.35        4          1 1A1                     2A2          1           2          1 1A1                     2A3          1.25        1          1 1A2         3           2A4          0.27        1          1 1A2         3           2A5          0.3         2          1 1A3                     2A6          25          1          1 1A3                     2A7          2           2          1 1A4                     2A8                      2          1 2A8                     3A1          3           1          2 2A8                     3A2          2           2          2 1A5                     2A9          0.5         4          1 1A5                     2A10                     1          1 2A10                    3A3          2           5          2 codepre  pMy expected rollup would be something likep  precodeParent          parentprice      level 1A1                4.65           1 1A2                3.00           1 1A3                29.00          1   1A4                14.00          1  2A8                7.00           2 1A5                12.00          1 2A10               10.00          2 codepre  pEDIT  Here is the query Ive been working withp  precodeWITH b      AS     SELECT CONNECTBYROOT childno root,                     childno,                     parentno,                     level,                     parentprc,                     childprc  childqty AS VALUE                FROM costrollup          START WITH parentno  1A1          CONNECT BY parentno  PRIOR childno   SELECT parentno,      CASE         WHEN parentprc IS NOT NULL THEN AVG parentprc         ELSE SUM VALUE      END         prc FROM b GROUP BY parentno, parentprc codepre
