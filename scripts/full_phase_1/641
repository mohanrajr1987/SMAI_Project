Positive 641 pIm getting ready to roll out a PHP application hosted on Google App Engine. It needs to have SSL support and Im trying to decide between SNI and VIP. There may be a chance some Windows XP users access the site, but probably not. My thought was to start out using VIP, check the Analytics to see if there are any Windows XP users, then switch to SNI if possible. p  pCan a switch like this be made If so, do you have any thoughts on the process of doing itp  pThanksp
Positive 641 pIm pretty new to SSL and Azure, so I have a couple questions.p  pI created a new SSL certificate and uploaded the .CSR to Azure, and the status says the certificate has been created, and I see the new expiration date and new thumbprint, etc, for that cert. However, when I go to my site and check the certificate status, the fromto dates of the old certificate dates are still listed. I uploaded this certificate a little early, and the end date of the current cert is 10302015, so on 1030, will I see the new expiration date or should I see it nowp  pThe second question might be an indicator of something wrong on my part when I uploaded the new certificate to Azure. The existing cert, which expires on 10302015, shows CNwww.mysite.com, OUDomain Control Validated, Owww.mysite.com, whereas the new certificate shows all the parameters but the Owww.mysite.com parameter. What does this third parameter indicatep  pThanks,p  pBenp
Positive 641 pI am trying to setup IIS Client Certificate Mapping Authentication and so far I have been unsuccessful. p  ol liI have a valid client authentication certificate li liI disabled all authentication methods in the Authentication feature of IIS for the target websiteli liUsing the configuration editor I setup iisClientCertificateMappingAuthentication as documented in various sources. In this series of screen we map a domain account to a certificate. This is done by exporting the certificate to a text file, removing the first and last line and making sure all is in one line.li ol  pThe problem is as followsp  pWhen I try browsing to a test page, browser correctly prompts for selection of a certificate. I select the correct certificate. I then get presented with p  pHTTP Error 401.2  Unauthorized You are not authorized to view this page due to invalid authentication headers.p  pIf I enable Anonymous Authentication then it works, but the user is not the one in the mapping it is the user running the browser.

But when I try to include the class I got a warning and lines later the fatal errorp  precodePHP Warning  includeonce SSL fatal protocol error in https192.168.0.1classAnyClass.php on line 1  PHP Fatal error  Class AnyClass not found in routecontrolMyClass.php on line 57 codepre  pI supose that the class wasnt be included so obviously there is no Class to create object.p  pThe question is, is there any way to make php omit or ignore the invalid SSL certificate or to make the whole OS accept this specific certificate, so php seems the certificate as valid.p  pThanks for your help.p  pDavidp

Positive 641 pWere trying to test loading data from our onpremise SQL Server 2008R2 machine to ParaSQL using SymmetricDS. We have a dedicated server instance with ParaSQL which requires an SSL connection. Certificates are provided by ParaSQL.p  pWhere were stuck is how to configure SymmetricDS to use secure socket layer for this connection. We can find some info in the documentation on how to generate keys on our end, but nothing on how to connect using provided certificates.p  pDoes anyone here have any experience with thatp  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 641 pI have a clientserver pair in which I have this messaging application to which im trying to add SSL support. The clientserver normally use DataInputStream and DataOutputStream to sendreceive their info, working with byte arrays DataOutputStream.writebyte[] and DataInputStream.readFullybyte[].

I even tried using other types of readerwriters like BufferedReaderBufferedWriter, and they work, but when I try to use bytes, it doesnt send anything. Whats weirder is the fact that after checking the DataOutputStream.size in both sides, they both print that they have sended data.p  pServer sidep  precodelogger.infoWaiting to accept a new client socket clientSocket  SSLSocket serverSocket.accept  logger.infoSocket accepted successfully DataOutputStream dataOutputStreamnewDataOutputStreamclientSocket.getOutputStream DataInputStream dataInputStreamnew DataInputStreamclientSocket.getInputStream  logger.traceSocket is going to read  int datadataInputStream.available byte[] messagenew byte[data]  dataInputStream.readFullymessage logger.traceMessage received ,message  logger.traceGonna respond ifmessage.lengthgt0     dataOutputStream.writemessage,0,message.length else     String responsenew Stringwot.getBytes,ASCII     dataOutputStream.writeresponse.getBytes,0,response.getBytes.length  dataOutputStream.flush  logger.traceChars written ,dataOutputStream.size codepre  pClient sidep  precodeSSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory  SSLSocketFactorySSLSocketFactory.getDefault logger.traceSSL Socket factory created javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket sslSocket  javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketsslsocketfactory.createSocketurl, port logger.traceSSL Socket created sslSocket.setSoTimeout6000  outputStream  sslSocket.getOutputStream inputStreamsslSocket.getInputStream  DataOutputStream dataOutputStreamnew DataOutputStreamoutputStream DataInputStream dataInputStreamnew DataInputStreaminputStream logger.traceInput and output created  dataOutputStream.writeBytesframe dataOutputStream.writeUTFframe  dataOutputStream.writeframe.getBytes,0,frame.getBytes.length  dataOutputStream.flush logger.traceFrame  sent,frame logger.traceBytes sent ,dataOutputStream.size  int datadataInputStream.available byte[] messageRead  new byte[data] dataInputStream.readFullymessageRead codepre  pAny help would be highly appreciated.

But, it turns out our web app sometimes needs to make web service calls to a thirdparty.  Turns out this third party hasnt updated their own crypto policy, and we need to use a sha1 key exchange with them.  p  pIn a cool twist, we learned that configuring IIS with the above tool also impacts key exchange when we act as a client, calling the third party  so our calls out to the web service fail because we cannot negotiate a key exchange.p  pIs there a way that I can programmatically configure the acceptable key exchange when I go to make an http request preferably locally, so that I am only applying the policy to my outbound connection, not to inbound connections hitting our web server p

If Im saying things that makes no sense, please dont hate on me as Ive never worked with SSL certificates before.p  pAlso, I cannot suppress the warnings as I use firebug and the warnings just makes my POST files harder to find.p

His code manipulates data when its dropped the strongHandleDropstrong shows popup menu, but data is prepared when drag is initiated in strongOnElementDragstrong. In my application there should be three different dragampdrop modes, and some of them require timeconsuming data preparation.

You can copy Excel diagram and paste it into MSWord where it will behave like an image well, sort of. Since it works I believe it can be done in winAPI.

I would like to get rid of this, or at least find a way to draw my own version of it that better fits within my interface.p  pI have tried about 15 different methods that seem like they emcouldem give me control over this focus rect drawing itself various first responder methods, various drawing methods, various highlight color methods, etc., but I have yet to find something that changes anything about it.p  pScreenshot of the problem a hrefhttptwitpic.com3zx2t relnofollowhttptwitpic.com3zx2tap  pI am almost annoyed enough to classdump AppKit and try to find whatever private method its using to draw this annoying focus rect. Nothing else I do has any effect on it. Any help here would really save both my sanity and lots of future hair pulling.p  pThanks so muchp

Negative 641 pSo I have a program that serves as a sort of shell for other programs.  At its core, it gets passed a class, a method name, and some args, and handles the execution of the function, with the idea of allowing other programmers to basically schedule their processes to run on this shell service.  Everything works fine except for one issue.  Frequently, these processes that are scheduled for execution are very CPU heavy.  At times, the processes called start using so much of the CPU, that the threads that I have which are responsible for checking schedules and firing off other jobs dont get a chance to run for quite some time, resulting in scheduling issues and a lack of sufficient responsiveness.  Unfortunately, I cant insert Thread.Sleep calls in the actual running code, as I dont really own it.  p  pSo my question is  Is it possible to force an arbitrary thread that I started to sleep yield every so often, without modifying the actual code running in that thread  Barring that, is there some way to inject Thread.Sleep calls into code that Im about to run dynamically, at runtimep

Negative 641 pI have seen many articles on why Test Driven Development is good and that it reduces development time and so on. But after searching through a lot of forums, I am still yet to get a concrete advantage of TDD. I am not saying testing is a bad thing, but my point is what is the harm if I write my unit test after I write my source code rather than viceversa as TDD proposes. And both the test cases do act like regression tests once it is complete. I also experienced a lot of problems while trying to follow TDD in a legacy code.I guess nowadays most of the code is legacy code where we have to modify code without preexisting tests. Also is TDD limited to unit tests only or even system level and integration tests. I am just not able to imagine how we can do integration tests without writing source code.p

Negative 641 pWhy hello SOers.

I would expect that the codewhilelog.eofcode loop would never execute in that case, but it does.  There is always at least one extraneous blank line in the file, sometimes two, and when input is read from the file, the input line is sandwiched between two blank lines.  After a few calls to this function, the codewhilelog.eofcode loop then goes into an infinite loop pulling blank lines from the file.  A typical runthrough of the program looks like thisp  precodestr   str Player moved.191 191 191 0 0 0 str   str  str Player moved.191 191 191 0 0 0  str   str  there should be a Player moved. line in here str  str  here as well str  str  also here str  str  str Player moved.191 191 191 0 0 0  str   str str str str str str onto infinite loop codepre  pCan anyone see what Im doing wrong herep  pEDIT As Amardeep suggested, I changed the codewhilelog.eofcode loop to a codedo...whilelog.failcode loop.  This fixed the infinite loop problem, but not the extraneous lines.  The program behaves as before, except where it once went into the infinite loop, it now reads nothing but blank lines where it should read input, like thisp  precodestr  str  str  str  etc. codepre

Negative 641 pBecause a customer requested it, Ive changed a div top  precodeposition absolute top 5px bottom 5px overflow auto minwidth 945px codepre  pwhich basically works fine in all supported browsers IE7, IE8, Firefox 3 It makes the div fill out the available area vertically, and show a vertical scrollbar if it doesnt fit. Note that without the minwidth of 945px, the scrollbar would overlay a part of the content, since the content is not resized properly when the scrollbar is added in all Internet Explorer versions. With the minwidth, it happens to fit, and other browsers dont care.p  pHowever, on IE7, if a vertical scrollbar is displayed and then the browser window is extended vertically so that the scrollbar is no longer needed, IE7 removes the scrollbar, but emleaves a blank rectangle where the scrollbar wasem, i.e. the div content is not extended to the former scrollbar area. When reloading the page in the same window, its fine. IE8 does not show this problem in standards mode.p  pHow can I solve thisp

Negative 641 pMy main aim is to serve large number of XML files   1bn each lt1kb via web server. Files can be considered as staic as those will be modified by external code, in relatively very low frequency about 50k updates per day. Files will be requested in high frequency 30 reqsec.p  pCurrent suggestion from my team is to create a dedicated Java application to implement HTTP protocal and use memcached to speed up the thing, keeping all file data in RDBMS and getting rid of file system.p  pOn other hand, I think, a tweaked Apache Web Server or lighttpd should be enough. Caching can be left to OS or web servers defalt caching. There is no point in keeping data in DB if the same output is required and only queried based on file name. Not sure how memcached will work here. Also updating external cache memcached while updating file via external code will add complexity.p  pAlso other question, if I choose to use files is is possible to store those in directory like abcd.xml and access via abcd.xml Or should I put all 1bn files in single directory Not sure OS will allow it or not.p  pThis is NOT a website, but for an application API in closed network so CloudCDN is of no use.p  pI am planning to use CentOS  Apachelighttpd.

Negative 641 pI have an iOS 3.2 program running on the iPad that is documentcentric. Sometimes, when closing a document, there is a memory spike in Instruments. Im pretty sure Im not leaking memory, since the allocations graph stays pretty steady between 5mb and 10mb, except when closing, where it spikes up by about 5mb or so and the leaks tool is showing very small leaks, a few k total, nothing that Id expect to cause crashing.p  pThis seems to be leading to iOS getting fed up and jettisoning my app. The memory use never goes about about 12mb, but the error log report displays that its using 19988 Count resident pages, which is way, way higher than anything else.p  pMy problem is that I have no idea where the spikes are happening or why. Its the same code, over and over, and sometimes a document will spike, other times it wont. There doesnt seem to be a way to use both the debugger to step through the code and Instruments to see whats going on at the same time, so Im not sure how to track down this problem.p  pIs there a way to see the memory use in the debuggerp

Negative 641 pIm maintaining an application that consumes a common library that  has a static instance of a classClassWrapper. This class is a basically a wrapper around the  Microsoft patterns and practicess CacheManager v3.1 of the ELp  pThe library is hosted in a web application and also in a windows service app, both are inherently multi threaded There are a bunch of places in the app that invokes an Add method on this wrapper which in turn calls the Add on the cache manager to add an item  to the cache manager. p  pAs I understand, the CacheManager is not thread safe and the CacheWrapper does not  perform any locking to ensure thread safety in the call to Add.p  pI cannot modify the library code directly to add synhronization code and am  considering writing a helper method like so and modifying all call sites to use this  helper instead of calling the Add on the wrapper directly.p  precodeclass CacheHelper      private static object syncLock  new object      public static void AddltTgtCacheWrapper wrapper, string key, T value, int expireInMins              lock syncLock                      wrapper.Addkey, value, expireInMins                codepre  pDo you see any problems with this approach. Im a bit weary since the CacheWrapper is static and hence inherently so is the syncLock.

Negative 641 panother homework assignment here thats kind of unclear on the requirements. It is a forms program that assigns people to seats on an airplane. The part that is losing me is that its telling me to display the passenger manifest in a list box, but then its telling me to display it in a list box. Then it calls it a rich text box again. The screenshots provided with the assignment only show one display box. One of the events that is supposed to be included is a double click on an item in the manifest display. When the flight is closed, it tallies up your first class and business class passengers and displays that info in the same display box. p  pSo my question is, was list box somehow incorporated into the rich text box I thought maybe it was just overlayed, but later screenschots show the display box filled and scrolled down, as if it were all the same text box, rather than just a list box or rich text. Im confused. Obviously, Im not looking for anyone to do my work for me, but it doesnt appear this was covered in our material. Online class, so I dont get a lot of instructor feedback on stuff like this, unfortunately. Can anyone offer to shed any light on thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC8LwR.jpg altalt textp

Negative 641 pIm looking for an elegant solution for the following problemp  pIn my database, I have some predefined entities. These entities have names and descriptions Strings. Around the data access layer, there are some EJBs containing business logic to loadsearch foretc. those entities.p  pNow for the frontend, we are developing a GWT application which calls the EJB methods on our backend.p  pThe problem is, that the name and the descriptions of the entities mentioned above must be internationalized  e.g., depending on the users locale, an entitys description must be My cool description English or Beschreibung bla German or whatever p  pMy first approach was to use a resource string in the database. So entity A has a description descriptionA, entity B has a description descriptionB... Later on, the GWT app or any other client translates this resource string into the actual description using some kind of resource bundle. E.g.p  presourcesen.propertiesp  pdescriptionAActual Description of Entity Ap  pdescriptionBActual Description of Entity Bp  presourcesde.propertiesp  pdescriptionABeschreibung Ap  pdescriptionBBeschreibung Bp  pRemember, the entities are predefined, so its possible to know all descriptions at compile time. BUT it would be better if the resource bundle could be enhanced without having to recompile the application.p  pIs this possible with GWT How can I do this Is it better to translate on the server or on the client sidep  pOtherwise, Ive to deal with all that i18n stuff on the backend side. Well, this would allow to keep data together instead of defining the descriptions on the client side. But the big drawback is that the backend must be aware of the callers locale.p  pRegards, Frankp

Negative 641 pIm trying to clean up data in a Name field in our database and split that data into FirstName, MiddleName, amp LastName.  Currently, Im using a codeCasecode statement to look for various triggers inside the text to help me format the output in a certain way.p  pHowever, Im starting to notice that Im nesting tests inside other tests and need to figure out how to process data recursively.  See this example of how Im extracting the FirstName.p  precodeCase    When CharIndex ,LTrimRTrimName in 0,1 Then  empty or LName   When LeftName,3 IN MR ,MS , DR ,MRS Then    Prefix Titles     Case If we found a prefix, run the same tests with the prefix removed       When CharIndex ,LTrimRTrimRightName,LenNameCharIndex ,Name         in 0,1 Then         When SubStringLTrimRTrimRightName,LenNameCharIndex ,Name,3,1           amp Then SubStringLTrimRTrimRightName,LenNameCharIndex ,         Name,1,5       Else LeftLTrimRTrimRightName,LenNameCharIndex ,Name,         CHarIndex ,LTrimRTrimRightName,LenNameCharIndex ,Name1      End   When SubStringLTrimRTrimName,3,1  amp Then      SubStringLTrimRTrimName,1,5 Look for initials e.g. J amp A Smith   Else LeftLTrimRTrimName,CHarIndex ,LTrimRTrimName1    End codepre  pSo, in order to get this to work in more complicated situations e.g. codeMR JOHN A SMITH JRcode, I would need to test recursively.  In imperative programming, I would do something like this if I had a function called codeGetFirstNamecodep  precodeGetFirstNameMR JOHN A SMITH JR GetFirstName identfies MR and within the function it calls      gt GetFirstNameJOHN A SMITH JR        GetFirstName identifies JR and within the function it calls                           gt GetFirstNameJOHN A SMITH               Finally, it returns JOHN codepre  pIdeally, it would be great to do this in straight SQL, but Im not sure that is possible.  What alternatives would I have if Im not using straight SQL Im using SQL Server 2005p

Negative 641 pWe are developing a big Website, and all our Images and Resources are in Amazon S3. We are also using Cloudfront to globally distribute our Content.

So we would need a Configuration Option that sets the Expires Header to a Date relative to the current Date for all Content.p  pAnother Solution would be to set CacheControl maxage to a certain Value. Does this work Is it accepted by major Browsers Will I destroy some caching Algorithms with this Why does YSlow recommend to set the Expires header but not CacheControl maxagep  pAny other Recommendations We are compressing CSS and JS, using Sprites where it is plausible, setting Expires headers and ETags where it is possible, and will soon compress our Images with the Yahoo Compression Tool and gzipping Output.p

Negative 641 pTheres an exceptional case in WPF where I need to set a dependency property via XAML that actually doesnt get stored itself, but rather is used to set other dependency properties.  This is pretty easy since I just use the CoerceValue to intercept the change, do what I want with the passedin value, then cancel the change on that property.  This means when I get that property, Ill still get the default value since I blocked the actual change.  Works great.p  pAs an example, when I set this faux CanvasRect10,10,40,20 DP, internally it actually sets the Canvas.Left, Canvas.Top, Width and Height DPs and CanvasRect itself still remains at its default of 0,0,0,0.p  pHowever, I had an idea that if I were to instead read the property, Id want to rehydrate that value based on those other dependency properties.  This can be done with a simple oneline function...p  precodereturn new rectCanvas.GetLeftthis, Canvas.GetTopthis, Width, Height codepre  pThink of it as sort of a CoerceValue but on the getter side, not the setter.  However, Im not sure how, or even if you can use functions to coerce the readback values like that. p  blockquote   pemstrongNote Yes, I know this method would invalidate any change notifications   for the CanvasRect DP but I dont   care, nor do I actually want that.  If   I did, Id instead store an actual   rect, then keep it in sync by   subscribing to the property changed   events of the Canvas.Left, Canvas.Top,   Width and Height DPs, which   functionally would give me what I   want, but this is more of a   convenience thing than an actual DP.    Plus this is a very simple example to show what Im asking.    The realworld example may be   timebased for instance where no DP   change notifications would matter anyway.emstrongp blockquote  pNow I know I could also simply implement what I wanted in the getter for the .NET wrapper property, but when reading via bindings and such, the .NET property wrapper gets bypassed which is why MSDN says to never use it for anything except for convenient delegation tp the DP.  Plus, realistically, for anything other than OneTime, this wouldnt make sense anyway as again, no change notifications would occur.p  pAnyway, as I said, the DP setter works great, but if I did want to put in the getter, Im not sure I can think of any other way except to wire up all those change notifications for the related DPs.p  pAnother example of why you may want to do this is because you want to use a value converter for the return value within the property getter itself, perhaps to keep the return values within a certain range, but not lose the actual stored values for other internal purposes.p  pBut back to the basic question here is there any way to use a function as the default value of a DP, or at least a CoerceValue on the getter sidep

Negative 641 pEDIT Apparently the question is not clearly formulated enough. The issue I am having is that when the destructor is defined in the header it gets added into multiple .obj files and the linker complains. The actual question isp  pWhen I add the destructor to a CPP file in a DLL project and use the dll with dynamic loading and the interface header file, does the base destructor still get called to prevent leaking memoryp  pI am using MSVC 10.0 and have a DLL project that implements an interface. The interface is an abstract pure virtual base class. The idea is that the header is used with dynamic loading of the library. Therefore, I have used a pure virtual destructor to make sure the destructor in the base class gets called. Here is sample code to explain thisp  precodeISplitter.h pragma once  struct param      int something   class ISplitter  public     virtual ISplitter  0     virtual void useful  0   ISplitterISplitter       Make sure base class destructor gets called   codepre  pAnd the main implementation headerp  precodeCSplitter.h pragma once include CHelper.h include ISplitter.h   class CSplitter  public ISplitter  private     CHelper hlp public     CSplitter     void useful  codepre  pSome helper classp  precodeCHelper.h pragma once include ISplitter.h  I need the struct   Class definition should go here but is irrelevant codepre  pNow the problem is that the linker generates an error that tells me the destructor ISplitterISplittervoid has been multiply declared and the system will not build. Errorp  precodeCHelper.obj  error LNK2005 public virtual cdecl ISplitterISplittervoid 1ISplitterUEAAXZ already defined in CSplitter.obj codepre  pWhat is the correct way to fix this I have placed the destructor in ISplitter.cpp, but I am worried this may not work if I dynamically load the library and upcast the base class to ISplitter.p

Negative 641 pI am try to fit an eGARCH model on an expanding basis using the rugarch package.  I have 6 columns of data, and I am trying refit parameters 6000 for each column.  If I run the following code, I get an error in windows on the 2nd column this means I am getting all the way through the first inner loop succesfully.  By using gc within the loop and removing the fitted object I have extended the length of time it takes to hit the memory error.  Also, this process takes a very long time in general and I am wondering if there is anyway to improve it on my end.  The package itself seems to be written pretty efficiently with most of the filtering being done in low level C.  I could probably refit the model every 3060 days, but I would really prefer to do it this way.  I am running R 2.13.2 on 32Bit windows.  Thanks in advance.

Negative 641 pOn the past few projects of mine Ive run into situations where I need to pass multiple parameters to a codeThreading.Timercode callback method. Unfortunately, the constructor only accepts a single codeobjectcode parameter. Not wanting to use global variables, the pattern Ive started using to overcome this problem is to pass in an anonymous method when the timer is created and use the compilers ability to capture variables to my advantage, like sop  precodepublic void SendEmailsRepeatedlyIEnumerableltSimpleEmailgt emails, int sendRepeatedlyDelayMS      Tokenizer tokenizer  new StandardTokenizer      sendRepeatedlyTimer  new Timer         SendRepeatedlyCallback,         Actiondelegate                      TokenizeAndSendEmailsemails, tokenizer         ,         0,         sendRepeatedlyDelayMS   private void SendRepeatedlyCallbackobject state      if abort              Action sendEmails  Actionstate         sendEmails       codepre  pSo my question is, is this a flagrant hack Is there a better or recommended way to do thisp

Negative 641 pThis is a followup of my last question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8489641cfullsystemcrashreleasemodeonlyC full system crash, release mode onlyap  pBasically I have a treelike data structure which, under Release mode, is completely freezing the OS. This occurs due to a sudden surge in memory allocation, which goes beyond what the OS can handle.p  pThis seeming memory leak which it is, but more on that in a minute is very weird because I have all the necessary code in place to initialise pointers to NULL and eventually allocate them when necessary if they are found to be NULL. In Debug mode, this correct behaviour is confirmed, and things are allocated fine I can see NULL pointers set to zero from the debugger.p  pBut in Release mode, things are different. The constructors are skipped completely, and all the classs internals are initialised to random garbage. This causes the pointers to go haywire as well, and thats where memory gets allocated until the whole system crashes.p  pWhy is Release mode ignoring my constructorsp  pIm using Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7 btw.p

Externally I can view the WSDL without a problem.p  pMy issue is, I want to call the methods of my WebService from within a JavaScript Canvas game Im writing. Whenever I make a request I get no response and the following error on the serverp  precodeMar 03, 2012 93924 PM com.sun.xml.internal.ws.transport.http.server.WSHttpHandler handleExchange WARNING Cannot handle HTTP method OPTIONS codepre  pSo Chrome is not doing a POST request as I asked, but is doing an OPTION request because apparently Im doing a crossdomain request. Im not sure how I am doing a crossdomain request when all of my files are on the same server my local computer.p  pIs the problem that I am posting an Endpoint of MyComputerName... but then the incoming request is to MyExternalIPAddress...  Is that why it is considered a crossdomain requestp  pIve looked at different options including JSONP which I didnt understand and I dont think my WebService supports it anyway but I think my best option is to set up a proxy server  but without understanding WHY I am doing a crossdomain request Im not sure exactly what Im doing.p  pId be very grateful for anyone who could help me understand whats going on here andor help me find a solution. So frustrating. Ive spent a good 6 hours today trying to solve this without any luck.p

Negative 641 pIm just about to refactor my current iOS project to use ARC. And after previewing the changes to migrate my current code to ARC using the Refactor to ARC tool i xCode, i can see my current code conventions probably not suited for ARC. Because it adds alot of weak  strong etc to my ivars.p  pHeres how my current conventions arep  pi define all instance variables as private or protected ivars. and all public variables i create a property for. p  precodeinterface TestClass   private  NSMutableArray mArray  NSString mString  BOOL mMyBoolean   property retain, nonatomic NSString string  public end codepre  pAll objects i always back with a property, to avoid dealing with release  retain so if i have a private variable that is a reference, i just create a category in the implementation. Struct like mMyBoolean i just leave define as a ivar.p  precodeinterface TestClass property retain, nonatomic NSmutableArray mArray end  implementation TestClass synthesize string  mString synthesize mArray  end codepre  pBut because the new ARC is taking care of retain  release i properly dont need private variables to be backed by property. p  pSo what code conventions would be more appropriate Ive been thinking about just defining properties in the interface like thisp  precodeinterface TestClass   private  NSMutableArray mArray  BOOL myBoolean   property strong, nonatomic NSString string end   implementation TestClass synthesize string end codepre  pAnd dont use category properties for private properties. also i removed the m prefix and i dont define the backed ivar that property should use, instead i just let xcode use its autogenerated.p

Let say we want to check any service methods request for correctness. If some requests codeAppDatacode property isnt null we should consider that request as correct. Actually it would be better for us to have some common class method for such checking. But how can we make that method if any request class has different codeAppDatacode property types p  pLet take a look at two generated classes and draw some imaginary path to each AppData properties.p  pFor first class, getcarsRequest we have in parentheses we has appropriate class type p  blockquote   prequest getcarsRequest  MessageWrap getcars  MessageData   MessageDataGetcarsRequest   AppData AppDataGetcarsRequestp blockquote  pFor the second we have next path p  blockquote   prequest getdriversRequest  MessageWrap getdrivers  MessageData   MessageDataGetdriversRequest   AppData AppDataGetdriversRequestp blockquote  pSo how can we redevise and reduce them to some generic interface If we have an appropriate, common interface for that two classes we could write some codeCheckRequestIRequestltTgt requestcode.p  pI hope I get some clarity here.

The image at the end of this question is what it looks like.p  pWhy would the image be over top of the window border, and how do I get it to be under the borderp  pThanks in advancep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQxeUg.png altenter image description herep

Negative 641 pI am needing help to determine the right approach. I want to make a backup of an internal database to a location in the external storage every time the whole application gets interrupted or terminateddestroyed. I want to call this method from a central class called Main which extends Application. The reason for that is, that I need to use several activites and I want to call the backup Method only when needed like described when the whole application gets destroyed or interrupted by another application. I try to avoid calling this backup method in every activity in their onPause methods.p  pI thought about starting a service in the onCreate method of the application, and starting the backup method when the service gets destroyed. But this wont help in the case of an interrupt, as far as I understood the logic behind services. And also the service doesnt seem to start. codestartServicenew IntentgetApplicationContext, BackupService.classcode Furthermore I dont think it is a good approach to just use the onDestroy method of a service, this is not what the service class is made for in my opinion.p  pSo summarizing my Question, do you know a better way then using a service, or if not do you know how I should use the service to be able to call a backup only at the point when the whole app and not only an activity is interrupted or destroyed.p

Negative 641 pI am working with some legacy Fortran code that calls a subroutine codesfir1dcode.  Googling for the subroutine name, I found that SGI used to ship some of this code in an codeSCSLcode library.p  pa hrefhttptechpubs.sgi.comlibrarytplcgibingetdoc.cgicoll0650ampdbmanampfnameusrsharecatmanpmancat3SCSLzfir1d.z relnofollowhttptechpubs.sgi.comlibrarytplcgibingetdoc.cgicoll0650ampdbmanampfnameusrsharecatmanpmancat3SCSLzfir1d.zap  pI am wondering if there is a modern, crossplatform equivalent for the codesfir1dcode function.  Is this part of the codeBLAScode libraryp  pMoreover, as listed at the webpage link above, the convolution seems to be very slow as implemented by this library in the time domain, and it would make more sense to use the FFT in the frequency domain.p  pIs there an accelerated crossplatform library that can perform the 1D convolution in exactly the same way  Or perhaps it would be better to simply write my own version not too difficult to do with an accelerated FFT library.p

Negative 641 pIve worked with codeNode.jscode for a little while and consider myself pretty good with Java.

I imagine a good Node web service for an asset management system would excel at handling many users submitting changes at the same time in a large, heavy traffic application.p  pBut after reading about the actors in Akka, it seams it would excel at the same thing.

With maybe Akkas selfhealing architecture having an advantage.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt looks like I am getting close votes.  Please dont take this question as a which is better, node or akka.

Negative 641 pIm writing a simple game and a lot of the game objects share attributes.  I have two potential implementations for this.p  pThe first is using inheritance as specified in the following imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDEZGe.png altClass Hierarchyp  pThe bolded classes are the abstract classes, as you might expect.  The branches are the derived classes which are actually used.  Its important to note that these classes hold data about the objects, there is no functionality associated with them.p  pTroop and Vehicle, for example, have a common interface that they both use to do things like attack and move.  The class  hierarchy outlined above is just the raw stats.  Furthermore, they are all true ISA relationships.  p  pThe second implementation uses composition.  Instead of the class hierarchy above, each of the abstract classes are instead modules that hold certain data members.  So SpecialAbility has a data member called PointsValueObject although I changed the names of the abstract though they are no longer abstract classes to reflect their modularattribute nature. And Troop has data members PointsValueObject, PhysicalObject, PhysicalAttackObject, and BattleOBject, each of them being  modules that house data about the troop.  Again, no functionality exists in these modules, they are used to store data only.  Behavior and functionality are still implemented through Interface classes.p  pMy question is this  people generally prefer composition over inheritance, but in this case, Im inclined to stick with inheritance, since the ISA relationships hold and the hierarchy does not contain behaviors, only data.  Is this hierarchy good OOD or is building the classes using the attribute modules better p

Negative 641 pHere is what Im trying to do  I want to have an app that displays a fullscreen image and have that image animate by sliding a UISlider.  A changing slider value will sequence through images of an array creating an animation.  This animation is a single character on a turntable.  The character looks as though he is rotating around the turn table as the slider changes value.p  pThis project is a portfolio piece for a 3D artist.  The artist gave me a sequence of 180 images of the character rendered at the full screen retina resolution.  He also gave be an additional 180 images rendered at the nonretina full screen resolution.  The idea is that when somebody is viewing his character from any angle on a retina iPad, they can toggle using a UISwitch between retina and nonretina display. The code posted below works fine on the simulator.p  pHowever when running this code on an iPad 4, it works for a bit, then I get a memory warning.  Then it crashes.  Im assuming having that many images of that size being displayed as fast as somebody wants to move a slider is too much for the iPad 4 to handle.  p  pIm curious what limitations I should take into account when working with images like this.  Is 180 images way too many  What is a reasonable amount  Is there a more efficient way of producing my desired result  Instead of resorting the guessandcheck method of how many images would not cause it to crash, I figured somebody might have some useful insight on my issue.p  precodeimplementation RBViewController   voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]  Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.  imageDisplay.image  [UIImage imageNamedHyperReal0.png]  arrayRetina  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity180] arrayNormal  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity180]  forint i  0 i lt 179 i      NSString myImageString  [[NSString alloc] initWithFormatHyperReali.png, i]     UIImage myImageGraphic  [UIImage imageNamedmyImageString]     [arrayRetina addObjectmyImageGraphic]   forint i  0 i lt 179 i   NSString myImageString  [[NSString alloc] initWithFormatlameHyperReali.png, i]     UIImage myImageGraphic  [UIImage imageNamedmyImageString]     [arrayNormal addObjectmyImageGraphic]     voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning  [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]  Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.

Negative 641 pI have a for loop that I would like to make parallel, however the threads must share an codeunorderedmapcode and a codevectorcode.p  pBecause the for loop is somewhat big I will post here a concise overview of it so that I can make my main problem clear.

So I decided to use simple locks in order to force a thread acquire the lock before writing to the vector. So in my implementation I had something like thisp  precode      omplockt sharedVectorLock       ompinitlockampsharedVectorLock       ...       for...       ...        ompsetlockampsharedVectorLock        sharedVector.pushbacki        ompunsetlockampsharedVectorLock       ...       ompdestroylockampsharedVectorLock codepre  pI had run my application many times and everything seemed to be working great, and thats until I decided to rerun it automatically too many times until I got wrong results. Because Im very new to the world of OpenMP and the threads in general, I wasnt aware of the fact that we should lock all the readers when a writer is updating some shared data. As you can see here in my application the threads always read some data from the codeunorderedmapcode in order make some conclusions and learn things about the key that was assigned to them. What happens though if two threads have to work with the same key, and while some other thread is trying to read the values of this key, another one has reached the point of updating those values I believe thats where my problem occurs.p  pHowever my main problem right now is that Im not sure what would be the best way to avoid such things from happening. Its like my system works for 99 of the time, but that 1 ruins everything because two threads are rarely assigned with the same key which in turn is because my unorderedmap is usually big.p  pWould locking the unorderedmap do my job Most likely, but that wouldnt be efficient because a thread codeAcode that wants to work with the key codexcode would have to wait for a thread codeBcode that is already working with the key codeycode where codeycode can be different than codexcode to finish. p  pSo my main question is, how should I approach this problem How can I lock the codeunorderedmapcode if and only if two threads are working with the same keyp  pThank you in advancep

The image below shows this visually. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXwMdw.png altexamplep  pThe checkboxes I are not in any  and are solely checkboxes. Im assuming this is the correct thing to do as I do not the whole table being part of the form. My question then is, how would I submit the checkboxes when Submit is pressed, so that I can check which checkboxes are usedp

I greatly appreciate the time and energy that the community invests in making this an excellent resource for everyone.p  pIm trying to fetch data from a server which uses Socket.IO in conjunction with XHRpolling data. Although I can seemingly connect with the Python script, I cant properly receive data.p  pIve looked at the outgoing and incoming packets in Fiddler every 5 seconds, the browser receives useful information i.e. 5namepollData,args[lt.., but the Python script receives NOOP responses 8.p  pstrongProblematic part of codestrongp  precodereply  requests.getURL  socket.io1t  strlongtime.time1000, headersheaders  sessionid  reply.text.split[0]  print Session ID, sessionid  reply  requests.postURL  socket.io1xhrpolling  sessionid  t                                     strlongtime.time1000, datamessage, headersheaders  print Successfully subscribed.  for i in range5     sleep5     reply  requests.getURL  socket.io1xhrpolling  sessionid  t                            strlongtime.time1000, headersheaders     print reply.text codepre  pIve tried using the Websocketclient, but it was generating this error WebSocketException Handshake Status 200p  pSocketIOclient produces this error SocketIOError Could not establish connectionp  pMore importantly than using another library to solve this problem, Id like to understand why this is happening.

Negative 641 pWe have an ASP.NET application that handles user uploaded files. Browser sends a multipart POST request. We have a simple HttpHandler and use HttpRequest.Files to access the uploaded file. It is running on IIS7.5 on Windows 2008 R2.p  pOccasionally, we see an error that the colletion contains 0 files. Upon inspecting HttpRequest.InputStream we see that we have an incomplete POST request. The ContentLength header indicates there should be more data, than there is.p  pWe manage to reproduce it using Fiddler  sending a request with requestBody lt ContentLength.   The application hangs on the first reference to HttpRequest.Params.   Terminate Fiddler, that closes the connection and application resumes. The application logic  as the body is incomplete 0 files.p  pI assume this is a scenario we have to deal with and cant do much about. After all the browser may close connection any time.p  pI wonder if there is some switch that would prevent IIS to handoff incomplete POST request to the application layer i.e. some buffer. This would eliminate some noise in the ApplicationLayer error monitoring.p  pThanks, Piotrp

Negative 641 pstrongEDIT As Dwin pointed out in the comments, the code below is not for an ROC curve. An ROC curve must be indexed in variation in codetcode and not in codelambdacode as I do below. I will edit the code below when I get the chance.strongp  pBelow is my attempt to create an ROC curve of glmnet predicting a binary outcome. Ive simulated a matrix that approximates glmnet results in the code below. As some of you know, given an emnem x empem matrix of inputs, glmnet outputs an emnem x 100 matrix of predicted probabilities [Pryi  1] for 100 different values of lambda. The output will be narrower than 100 if further changes in lambda stop increasing predictive power. The simulated matrix of glmnet predicted probabilities below is a 250x69 matrix.p  pstrongFirst, is there an easier way to plot a glmnet ROC curve Second, if not, does the below approach seem correct Third, do I care about plotting 1 the probability of falsetrue positives OR 2 simply the observed rate of falsetrue positivesstrongp  precodeset.seed06511   Simulate predictions matrix phat  as.matrixrnorm250,mean0.35, sd  0.12 lambdaeffect  as.matrixseqfrom  1.01, to  1.35, by  0.005 phat  phat  tlambdaeffect   Choose a cutpoint t  0.5  Define a predictions matrix predictions  ifelsephat gt t, 1, 0  Simulate y matrix yphat  applyphat, 1, mean  rnorm250,0.05,0.10 yobs  ifelseyphat gt 0.55, 1, 0  percentage of 1 observations in the validation set,  p  lengthwhichyobs1lengthyobs     dimtestframe2e2  probability of the model predicting 1 while the true value of the observation is 0,  applypredictions, 1, sum   Count false positives for each model  False pos 1, correct  0, false neg  1 errormat  predictions  yobs  Define a matrix that isolates false positives errormatfp  ifelseerrormat 1, 1, 0 falseposrate  applyerrormatfp, 2,  sumlengthyobs   Count true positives for each model  True pos  2, mistakes  1, true neg  0 errormat2  predictions  yobs  Isolate true positives errormattp  ifelseerrormat2 2, 1, 0 trueposrate  applyerrormattp, 2,  sumlengthyobs    Do I care about 1 this probability OR 2 simply the observed rate  1 probability of falsepositive,  pfp  falseposrate1p probability of truepositive,  ptp  trueposratep  plot the ROC,  plotpfp, ptp    2 plotfalseposrate, trueposrate codepre  pTheres one question on this on SO, but the answer was rough and not quite right a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11362974glmnetlassoroccharts1146216911462169glmnet lasso ROC chartsap

Negative 641 pI have a table that gets created using php drawing straight out of a database. Each codetdcode is editable and, when the mouse is clicked elsewhere, the new data is sent to the database and updated dynamically through code.ajaxcode. That all works flawless.

Im doing it with xmlSerializer and that works fine, except for one thing.p  pThis is how I serialize some data p  precodexmlSerializer.startTagnull, imageURL xmlSerializer.textNode imageURLList.item0.getNodeValue xmlSerializer.endTagnull, imageURL codepre  pThe problem that I have now is that the XML I get is built up like thisp  precoderootelement      elementwithAttribute START           data      elementwithAttribute END      elementwithAttribute START           data      elementwithAttribute END rootelement codepre  pThe Attribute I have for the file is the number of the entryp  precodeentry nr1 codepre  pI tried doing it like the followingp  precodexmlSerializer.startTagnull, rank nri  data  xmlSerializer.endTagnull, rank codepre  pBut this put me out of my for loop and only the first entry worked until the rank was closed improperly. When I close the tag like thisp  precodexmlSerializer.endTagnull, rank nri codepre  pit works without problems, but then the XML file doesnt look like I want it to look like. How can I achieve it, that the serializer knows that coderankcode is the end tag of coderank nrcodep

Negative 641 pIm doing work with a non Maven, I believe Netbeans module, which is being used as a Plugin for a program built on top of the Netbeans platform.p  pWhat I wanted to do was use custom annotations to add a sort of documentation of how to use the GUI elements of the plugin Im working on, when a user goes to the help menu and selects how to use.p  pMy thought was create a custom annotation, where a user supplies name, and help information for a class.

However, when I then choose to input the value of for example 6 As, the display does NOT give me 6 letter As, but ELEVEN letter As, ie. AAAAAAAAAAA. In other words, my RESET or refresh JButton only clears the screen, but it does NOT erase the previous value. Instead, it ADDS the previous value to the current value and I get the WRONG number of As when I click the button a second time. Can someone please tell me what line of code I should add to the actionPerformed method to make it right Or does this line have to go into the create GUI method Im completely lost.

Such conflicts are far fetched but I have come across a protocol method definition simply declared as voidwillStartLogin. Im sure you can already start thinking and suggesting how such a protocol method is bad, it could for example have been implemented by the delegate for personal  internal use and not for use under the myDelegate protocol. It would be better to declare MyProtocols method as so voidmyObjectWillStartLoginMyObjectmyObjectInstance so as to get rid of any ambiguity and make things obvious.p  pI hope I am not missing anything that makes it only necessary to check respondsToSelector Thank youp

Negative 641 pSo, Im trying to do readonly access of a zip file in Java, decompressing in a multithreaded manner, because my standard simple singlythreaded solution of ZipFileZipEntry using the enumeration and inputstreams and whatnot results in it taking about five full seconds just to decompress into memory a 50meg zipfile which takes one second AT MOST for my disk to read without decompressing.p  pHowever, the entire Java zip library is synchronized to an incrediblyobnoxious degree, no doubt because its all abstracted for readingwritingetc. in the same code instead of having nice efficient nonsynchronized readonly code.p  pIve looked at thirdparty Java libraries, and all of them are either massive VFS libraries that are worse than using an elephant gun to shoot a fly, or else the only reason they have a performance benefit is they multithread to the extent that most of the threads are blocking on disk IO anyway.p  pAll I want to do is pull a zipfile into a byte[], fork some threads, and work on it. Theres no reason any synchronization would be needed in any way for anything, because each of the unzipped files I use separately in memory without interaction.p  pWhy must this be so difficultp

I suppose I could build a code generator for doing this unique to each DSL but it would be great if XText had a generic feature allowing me to take an in memory model of my DSL and generate the DSL code like it nicely does from code to ecore model.

Negative 641 pI am new to pandas and also still quite new to python so please bear with me. Here is the question p  pI read some data from excel, including some dates.

So I wrotep  precodedf.index  df.index.date  where df is a DataFrame object codepre  pI found out that after this codedf.index.namecode is codecode, but it should be codeDatecode. It seems strange to me why the code.namecode property should be changeddeleted after the code.datecode conversion. I know I can simply put it back as codedf.index.name  Datecode, but is there any kind of explanation for this behaviour or is it a bug.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 641 pThis code is meant to open opensles audio record capture a stream in mono, copy the stream and process left channel and right channel separately, then mix both channels into an output stream which is later played using opensles as well. the reason of the assembly code is because i found a bottle neck in the mixing function i had previously written in c which was a simple for loop to join left and right buffer into output bufferp  pwell the problem is quite weird, when i put the logs i get in the output stream just what i want, the mixing of left and right buffer working and i see it in the logs, when i try to play the stream the application crashes, the same happens whenever i comment the logs, for some reason the app just crashes, so im starting to think it has something to do with the registers i am using or something in assembly code, i am new to assembly so is there something i am missing about arm assemblyp  pany idea why this is happening or how should i fix this problemp  phere is the code the first function is the main function which i use to capture sound call process functions.

Negative 641 pI wonder what happens if I call a method that is marked as async without using await. Consider this examplep  precodeprivate int id  0 async Task Initialize       var content  await LoadFromDiskid      await Processcontent      return   DataId      get  return id      set  id  value Initialize   codepre  pI know that this will produce a compile warning, but my question is if the awaited method calls in Initialize will still work as one would expect. As you can see it is not necessary for the setter to await Initialize as there is no return value and its the last call of the propertys setter. Its kind of fire and forget.p  pThe reason I would like to do this is that I would like to combine MVVM and a data backend that forces me to use async methods.p  pIn the example above, the user selects an entry from a list and the program should display detailed information about the entry in another part of the view.p  pI would like to bind the currently selected entry of the list to DataId, which updates the detail view whenever the user changes the selection. Of course, it would be possible to do the async method calls from an event handler but I would like to avoid event handlers for the sake of a cleaner MVVM implementation using mostly databinding.p

Negative 641 pIm struggling to find a solution to something I thought would have been simple. In a separate app, Im copying an Excel workbook, running a bunch of database queries and dumping the result into the newly copied workbook, giving each result a defined name named range.p  pIn the Excel template its not a real template, just a workbook being copied there are, on another worksheet, some charts that reference the named ranges.p  pWhen I originally built the template I simply inserted a chart and typed the named range in as the data source from the Select Data option. The chart looked fine...p  pThe problem is that the app that dumps the data into Excel wont always put the named ranges in the same location and the chart appears to be looking for a specific range of cells referenced e.g. CategoryDataA23B29 rather than simply nrCategoryTotals which is the named range I originally typed. .p  pSo the question is... Is there anyway I can get the chart to always point to the named range, even if the named range is created in a different location with the following conditions 1. No user interaction I realise manually moving a named range does not have this problem as Excel handles the updates 2. The location and size of the named range will vary, only the sheet it appears on is consistentp  pI hope that made sensep  pAl.p

Negative 641 plong time searcher but first time Im posting a question. I am an IT student going into [havent started yet] my second programming class.

Negative 641 pDoes the C standard mandate that the strongnonnegativestrong range of a standard signed integer type is at least as big as the negative rangep  pEDIT Please note that I am referring to the strongnonnegativestrong range here, not the strongpositivestrong range which is obviously one smaller than the strongnonnegativestrong range.p  pEDIT If we assume C11, the answer is Yes. See my clarifications below. From the point of view of C03, the answer is probably No.p  pThe same question can be posed as follows Does the standard guarantee that the result of codea  bcode is representable in a standard signed integer type codeTcode assuming that both codeacode and codebcode are strongnegativestrong values of type codeTcode, and that codea  bcodep  pI know that the standard allows for twos complement, ones complement, and sign magnitude representation of negative values see C11 section 3.9.1 [basic.fundamental] paragraph 7, but I am not sure whether it demands the use of one of those three representations. Probably not.p  pIf we assume one of these three representations, and we assume that there is no spurious restrictions on either of the two ranges negative, and nonnegative, then it is indeed true that the nonnegative range is at least as big as the negative one. In fact, with twos complement the size of the two ranges will be equal, and with the two other representations, the size of the nonnegative range will be one greater than the size of the negative one.p  pHowever, even if we assume one of the mentioned representations, it is really not enough to guarantee anything about the size of either range.p  pWhat I am seeking here, is a section or set of sections that unambiguously provides the desired guarantee.p  pAny help will be appreciated.p  hr  pNote that something like the following would suffice Every bit within the storage slot of the integer has one, and only one of the following functionsp  ul liUnusedli liSign bit exclusively, or mixed signvalue bitli liValue bit participating in the valueli ul  pI have a vague memory that C99 says something along those lines. Anyone that knows anything about thatp  hr  pAlright, C99 with TC3 does provide the necessary guarantees in section 6.2.6.2 Integer types paragraph 2p  blockquote   pFor signed integer types, the bits of the object representation shall be divided into three groups value bits, padding bits, and the sign bit. There need not be any padding bits there shall be exactly one sign bit. Each bit that is a value bit shall have the same value as the same bit in the object representation of the corresponding unsigned type if there are M value bits in the signed type and N in the unsigned type, then M  N . If the sign bit is zero, it shall not affect the resulting value. If the sign bit is one, the value shall be modified in one of the following waysp      ul   lithe corresponding value with sign bit 0 is negated sign and magnitudeli   lithe sign bit has the value 2supNsup  twos complementli   lithe sign bit has the value 2supNsup  1 ones complement .li   ul      pWhich of these applies is implementationdefined, as is whether the value with sign bit 1 and all value bits zero for the first two, or with sign bit and all value bits 1 for ones complement, is a trap representation or a normal value. In the case of sign and magnitude and ones complement, if this representation is a normal value it is called a negative zero.p blockquote  pCan someone confirm that this part of C99 is also a binding part of C11p  hr  pI have taken another careful look at both the C99 and the C11 standards, and it is clear that the guarantees in C99 section 6.2.6.2 paragraph 2 are binding in C11 too.p  pC89C90 does not provide the same guarantees, so we do need C99, which means that we do need C11.p  pIn summary, C11 and C99 provides the following guaranteesp  ol lipNegative values in fundamental signed integers types standard  extended strongmuststrong be represented using one of the following three representations Twos complement, ones complement, or sign magnitude.pli lipThe size of the strongnonnegativestrong range is strongonestrong greater than, or equal to the size of the negative range for all fundamental signed integers types standard  extended.pli ol  pThe second guarantee can be restated as followsp  precode1  minltTgt  maxltTgt  0 codepre  pfor any fundamental signed integers type codeTcode standard  extended where codeminltTgtcode and codemaxltTgtcode are shorthands for codestdnumericlimitsltTgtmincode and codestdnumericlimitsltTgtmaxcode respectively.p  pAlso, if we assume that codeacode and codebcode are values of the same, or of different fundamental signed integer types standard or extended, then it follows that codea  bcode is well defined and representable in codedecltypea  bcode as long as codeacode and codebcode are either both negative or both nonnegative.p

Negative 641 pIm a rails newbie building my first application.

Negative 641 pI am now trying to setup my first RESTful project using Spring Framework.

But another way is to add RequestBody to a controller and return pure objects as JSONprefered by me or XML.p  pNow I am trying to setup RESTfulbackend with Spring and handle it with separated HTML5jQuery project. Its for now difficult for me a little bit and I wonder about start using FreemarkerJSPs. p  pBut I am afraid that it wont be RESTful then. I would return view, not just pure Objects and my question is Is it still RESTful practicep  pSecond, a bit smaller question is What are differences between using template languages like FreemarkerVelocity and using HTML5  jQuery Now, as an amateurprogrammer I think that using HTML5jQuery approach takes much more time than using eg. Freemarker.  I know that in big companies we can seperate FRONTEND and BACKEND teams with dividing project into two piecies Spring REST backend  and jQueryHTML frontend  and let frontenders do their job. But is the point not to use Freemarker for jQuery and vice versap  pLooking forward to hearing from you guys p

Negative 641 pIm using a HTML Form to send data to a servlet, the servlet then checks the data submitted is valid against some rules and reloads the page with new request attributes to return the results. I can almost guarantee its not the best way of doing it but I dont think thats causing the issue. I think the issue lies in the fact the form redirects to localhost8080Register rather than localhost8080projectcontextRegister. Is there any way to specify the path inside the HTML Could I do it with some JSP expressions Id rather not hardcode the project path as it may change in future.

Negative 641 pFor a SOLR search, I want to treat some results differently where the field ispromoted is set to 1 to give them a better ranking. After the normal query is performed, the order of the results should be rearranged so that approximately 30  of the results in a given range say, the first 100 results should be promoted results. The ordering of the results should otherwise be preserved.p  pI thought it would be a good idea to solve this by making a custom SOLR plugin. So I tried writing a SearchComponent, but it seems like you cant change the ordering of search results after it has passed through the QueryComponent since they are cachedp  pOne could have written some kind of custom sort function or a function query but the challenge is that the algorithm needs to know about the scoreordering of the other surrounding results. A simple increase in the score wont do the trick.p  pAny suggestions on how this should be implementedp

Negative 641 pIve got a treelike structure in four interrelated select boxes. The idea is that after selecting codecategory1code it displays valid options in codecategory2code, and so on for codecategory3code and codecategory4code. This part of a form can repeat itself more than once.p  pAn example the user can have as many vehicles as it want. First category is type of vehicle truck, car, etc, second is brand, third is color and fourth is fuel type.p  pIn Backbone I listened to change events, updating successive select options accordingly. And Im not sure how to structure this behavior in Ember. An example of an app that works with related DOM elementsevents like this would be great.p  pMy first attempt was to create a view for the form, that would listen to codeinputcode change events on the select boxes. But the selects are views themselves, and I cant easily refer to the interrelated views.

Negative 641 pFirst off I had the problem of if I wanted to keep a field blank on my form and only search on another field Such as if you had 2 fields but I only wanted to search the database for one, and keeping the other blank it would come back with the right results.p  pI did this by using Like [Forms][BackUpValidationForm13][AccountCMBO] amp  in all of the fields on my form and just changing the textbox area to the new textbox.  This worked like a charm.p  pBut now My new question is I need to keep that functionality and also allow for a range.  p  pI have an access link that is to a server table. The table has a column that has a low number and then a separate column that has a high number. For example, the low could be 100 and the high could be 200. This means that any account that falls in between those 2 numbers pass the test of this table. So If I had an account that had an account number of 101 and I put that in my form and click the run button it should bring back any row that has both fields as 101 so low and high is both 101, meaning this is the only account that this rule applies to and any other row that has say low of 100 and high of 200 because its in between both of those. I have a few columns like this, account low and high, function low and high.p  pBasically with just using the criteria that I started with Like [Forms][BackUpValidationForm13][AccountCMBO] amp  it would not capture those records that have a range that may be under it and then above it meaning its in the middle some where.p  pI have tried Between [ACCOUNTCD] And [ACCOUNTCDHIGH] and it works by itself.  But if I put that same thing in the other field that is on this form too and I leave that field blank and I just search for account in the form it will bring back no results.p  pIve tried the followingp  pLike em And Between [ACCOUNTCD] And [ACCOUNTCDHIGH] amp em and also tried Between [ACCOUNTCD] And [ACCOUNTCDHIGH] amp  and for the other field the same things in conjunction with each other and neither will produce data togetherp  pAlso Tried   Like [Forms][ValidationForm13][AccountCMBO] amp em And Between [ACCOUNTCD] And [ACCOUNTCDHIGH]  with the same thing in the other form field  Like [Forms][ValidationForm13][FunctionR3CMBO] amp em And Between [OPTYP] And [OPTYPHIGH]p  pAnd also tried putting an Or in between them instead of an Andp  pAnyone know how I can fix thisp  pMy Actual Access SQL    p  precodeSELECT VALIDATIONRULE3.ACCOUNTCD, VALIDATIONRULE3.ACCOUNTCDHIGH, Rule3Accounts.Description, Rule3Accounts.D0DESCA, Rule3Accounts.D0TYPE,  Rule3Accounts.D0PARENT, Rule3Accounts.D0WEIGHT, Rule3Accounts.D0LEVEL, Rule3Accounts.D0CHILD, Rule3Accounts.D0PRIORITY, Rule3Accounts.D0STATUS, Rule3Accounts.D0CHILDSORT, Rule3Accounts.D0CREATE, Rule3Accounts.D0MODIFY,  Rule3Accounts.D0BALTYPE, Rule3Accounts.AccountText, VALIDATIONRULE3.XPNOPTYPCD  FROM Rule3Accounts INNER JOIN O8VALIDATIONRULE3 ON Rule3Accounts.AccountText  O8VALIDATIONRULE3.ACCOUNTCD  WHERE [Forms][ValidationForm13][AccountCMBO] Like [Forms][ValidationForm13][AccountCMBO] amp  Or [Forms][ValidationForm13][AccountCMBO] Between [ACCOUNTCD] And [ACCOUNTCDHIGH] amp  AND [Forms][ValidationForm13][FunctionR3CMBO] Like  [Forms][ValidationForm13][FunctionR3CMBO] amp   Or [Forms][ValidationForm13][FunctionR3CMBO] Between [XPNOPTYPCD] And [XPNOPTYPCDHIGH] amp  codepre

Negative 641 pI am working off an Arduino UNO with an AdaFruit pn532 NFCRFID shield.  The Goal is to have a shoe box, with a false bottom.

This is essentially using the adaFruit mifare example.p  pI then set up the UNO with two shields and in the loop checked both..  worked exactly the same.  Once there were three tags, regardless of which pn352 they were placed on 2 on one, and 1 on another, or all three on one it only logs one tag.p  pHas anyone tried to create anything that would detect up to 6 tags in range  If so could you share your discoveriesp  pNew to Arduino..p  pthanksp

Negative 641 pIn an ember.js application that I am working on ember v1.8.0beta1, embercli, I have a page with a simple signup type form that includes a country select dropdown. The problem is that since this field has a relatively large number of options 244 to be exact, there is a big rendering performance hit, the route takes almost a full second longer to render when that select field is added to the template.p  pI assummed that this slowdown was due to Ember having to create bindings for each of the 244 codeltoptiongtcode views within the select, so following a hrefhttpsgithub.comemberjswebsitepull1402filesshortpath5a71fab relnofollowthis cookbook entrya that I found, I attempted to create an unbound version of codeEmber.Selectcode like sop  pappviewsunboundselect.jsp  precodeimport Ember from ember  export default Ember.Select.extend     optionView Ember.SelectOption.extend         templateName unboundoption       codepre  papptemplatesunboundoption.hbsp  precodeunbound view.label codepre  papptemplatessignup.hbsp  precode... view unboundselect valuecountry contentcountries ... codepre  pHowever, doing this instead of using a regular codeEmber.Selectcode does not seem to help with the rendering speed at all.

Negative 641 pI know this question has been answered many times.  In fact if you refer to a hrefhttpwww.percona.comfilespresentationsppc2009PPC2009mysqlpagination.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.percona.comfilespresentationsppc2009PPC2009mysqlpagination.pdfa  you get the answer.p  pHowever I have a doubt about this common approach as follows.p  pIf you refer to slide 18, consider the following sequence of eventsp  ol liclient fetches  first pageli lia post with ID19 exists in the third page , and its thumbup count increases to 98, thereby pushing it to first pageli liclient fetches second pageli ol  pThe client will then miss the post ID19.  Im doing a mobile app where the items are cached on the clients side imagine an infinite scrolling list.  If the cache is not updated regularly, then this post will be missed for some timep  pAny smart way to ensure the client never misses any items, especially in a situation where the client is fetching items that may be updated concurrently by other users p  pI thought of imposing a unique updated timestamp for each item in the table, as a solution  . However,  this would need some form of serialization to maintain the uniqueness of the timestamp, and wouldnt perform so well for a large number of updates. We also need to ensure the timestamp is monotically increasing, otherwise items may be missed as well.p
Negative 641 pA new database is to store the log data of a series of web servers.  The structure of the log records has been converted to this nave general schemap  precodeCREATE TABLE log      matchcode SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     stamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,     ip INET,     bytes NUMERIC,     vhost TEXT,     path TEXT,     useragent TEXT,      and so on  codepre  pAnd so on, there are many more fields, but this shows the general principle.  The bulk of the data are contained in freetext fields as shows above.  Of course, this will make the database rather big in the long run.  We are talking about a web server log, so this doesnt come as a big surprise.p  pThe domain of those text fields is limited, though.  There is e.g. a very finite set of vhosts that will be seen, a much larger, but still decidedly finite set of paths, user agents and so on.  In cases like this, would it be more appropriate to factor the text fields out into subtables, and reference them only via identifiers  I am thinking along a line like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE vhost  ident SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, vhost TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE  CREATE TABLE path  ident SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE  CREATE TABLE useragent  ident SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, useragent TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE   CREATE TABLE log      matchcode SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     stamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,     ip INET,     bytes NUMERIC,     vhost INTEGER REFERENCES vhost  ident  ,     path INTEGER REFERENCES path  ident ,     useragent INTEGER REFERENCES useragent  ident ,      and so on  codepre  pI have tried both approaches now.  As expected, the second one is much smaller, by give or take factor three.  However, emqueryingem it becomes significantly slower due to all the joins involved.  The difference is by about an order of magnitude.p  pFrom what I understand, the table should be sufficiently normal in both cases.  At some later point in the project, therell maybe be additional attributes attached to the various text values like additional information about each vhost and so on.p  pThe practical considerations are obvious, its basically a spacetime tradeoff.  In the long run, what is considered best practice in such a case  Are there other, perhaps more theoretical implications for such a scenario that I might want to be aware ofp

Negative 641 pI am currently using Mule ESB 3.4. to create a DataMapper with a database lookup table. It was working as the way I wanted to. But the value in the database lookup connection is hard coded now, which would be an issue when deploying to different servers dev to prod. And I tried to find the way to make it to loadread from the properties files, but seems no luck. Usually, if you define a global connector, it would show up in the drop down list for you to choose, but the connection inside the datamapper using the database lookup table seems can not read the global connector information, I guess it is due to the fact that this setting is stored in the mapping file the grf file instead.p  pIs there a way to dynamically loadread the connection information from the properties file like codejdbc.usercode or any other way to make it dynamically loadread instead of hardcoded valuep

I am concerned that if a user sets preferences while using the plugin on a page from one hostname, say codeone.domain.comcode, on the off chance they go to use the plugin on another page hosted on codetwo.domain.comcode, they would need to set their preferences all over again. When I set the cookies, I would like to be able to set them sitewide at the codedomain.comcode level. Because this is a plugin, the domain name will not be known and needs to be calculated starting from codewindow.location.hostnamecode.p  pSo is there a standard way of arriving at what Im looking for Or am I just approaching this the wrong way I suppose I could just have a configuration setting for the website owner to input their base domain name and get it that way, but Id prefer not to go that route if possible. And honestly, Id still like to know how to do this anyway. Thanks in advance for any suggestionsp

Negative 641 pI have tried for ages to find out how to do something which, on the face of it, seems simple.  Basically, I have three textboxes on an Excel userform which hold currency amounts read in from three cells on a worksheet.  I want to sum the contents of the three textboxes into a fourth textbox but, no matter what I try, the best I can achieve is to get the three values concatenated, not added. I have spent many hours trying to solve this without success and have written so many experimental bits of code that I think it will only confuse matters if I show any of it.  Can anyonehelp, pleasep

Negative 641 pI have a large project that I have to load and work on.

Sure, I know it is required, but cannot it be somehow done in the background I would be content if I could just open some text editor and tune configs or read documentation without popups stealing the focus.p  pIt happens on all project regeneration we use GYP  since VS solution and projects are generated each time I have to work on new C definesflagsdependencies settings I have to sit and watch VS spamming those little windows.p  pIt has another drawback  if right after project regeneration Ill try to build it VS will block  it will complain that it cannot close the project when build is running and I have to terminate the build in order to close the project. I understand that what it really does is close and reopen it in order to update settings... but popup that locks whole IDE certainly makes it more annoying.p  pI know that I can disable automatic reload of source file when it was edited outside by e.g. Sublime Text. Are there some solutions that would allow me to do the same for projects Some settings, plugins or register entries that would prevent those windows from spamming or which would reload project when it suits me Its really annoying when I have to switch to ST each time I regenerate and build projects because Visual Studio will stay locked until the build is finished.p

For normal timing operations ticks, timeouts, etc it is easier and much more efficient to use Handler. Note Beginning with API 19 KITKAT alarm delivery is inexact the OS will shift alarms in order to minimize wakeups and battery use. There are new APIs to support applications which need strict delivery guarantees see setWindowint, long, long, PendingIntent and setExactint, long, PendingIntent.

We may note that the sequence is a variation on the Fibonacci sequnece but it doesnt help much as the sequences with C  1 are divergent from the regular Fibonacci sequence and thus we cant apply any of the approximations like Binets Fibonacci number formula to calculate Fn2  1 which would normally be the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers.p  pI thought of expressing the terms with C only and applying some fast modpow but it falls short both because its slow we still have to calculate the coefficient at each term which is a loop for every power in the final sum and hard to compute it emlooksem like there is a pattern but it soon becomes tedious and hard to prove how it will progress.p  pWhats a good way of solving this for max inputsp

Negative 641 pDisclaimer I am new to swing.p  pstrongTLDRstrong I am dynamically adding JPanels to an enclosing JPanel with a button. All panels use MiGLayout. The outer panel contains one cell only, and more rows are created as inner panels are added, top to bottom flowy constraint. The inner panels are made of two rows but the second one is revealed dynamically hidemode 3 layout constraint, with codesetVisiblefalsecode until a condition is met.p  pWhats happening, is when adding an inner panel, and causing its second row to be visible, it overlaps with the panel below it. I have tried to call revalidate and repaint everywhere possible. To me, it would seem that the outerenclosing panel simply has to revalidate its child components, but this doesnt seem to be happening.p  h2Backgroundh2  pI am using MiGLayout and Swing to create a GUI for importing to my database.

It was my understanding that coderevalidatecode should take care of these things but I have called it every place possible perhaps too much, if possible to no avail..p  pI have tried many different constraints on the enclosing panel as well as the inner panels, with no luck. I have tried both creating the second row and showhiding it dynamically, or simply creating it dynamically, with no luck. It consistently overlaps the same way, and I cannot get it to relayout these inner panels. p  pI can think of some work arounds, but this seems like it should be possiblep  pMy longest question ever, sorry for that.

Negative 641 pOK, so again there is likely a simple solution to this, but I am a beginner and nothing seems simple to me. p  pI have a view and a template that shows the attributes of an instance of a Car class that I have modeled. This Car class has a ManyToMany relationship with my custom User class. The template that show the attributes of a given instance of Car has many variables. The view for each Car works fine. Here is what I cant get to workp  pI have a user profile page for each instance of User. From that page, I want to show the attributes of each Car that a particular User has favorited. I am unable to figure out how to do this.p  pI have tried the  include  tag to include a snippet of the Car template and then use a for statement to iterate through the favorite set of the User. In theory, this would populate the User page with each Car that they have favorited and show its attributes. However, I do not know how to pass the  include  tag the proper context so the attributes are populated correctly for each instance of Car. Is this possible p  pIs there a simpler way to do it that I am just overlookingp  pAny help is appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 641 pIm currently writing a web application that provides some database manipulation. The system also needs to be capable working with different databases.The problem is that certain fields in the database have to be updated with data from a RESTful api.  To perform these updates, I use a Quartz.NET schedule that makes a job for every table that needs to be updated.This job checks if it needs to update the relevant database. If it does, it gets the information from the RESTservice. When I dont use multithreading, there are no problems with accessing the RESTserivce. But when I use Quartz.net, the server returns a 401 error for some requests. This behavior is inconstistent and doesnt always happen. Im using RestSharper to make these calls with a custom Authenticator for digest authentication.

Negative 641 pWe have a WCF  Rest service running on the host. I need to make a client call to the host that would initiate a long running task on the server even up to 15 min, then check back once that process has finished to get the result. One solution is to have client checking the host every minute or so after the initial call  but that seems not very productive. Is there a way to expose some type of event through WCF so that client would be notified when the task completed on the server What is the best approach for this type of scenario thanksp
Negative 641 pThe nature of the environment I am using means I need to create functionality that draws a line chart and I am having trouble working out the mathematics for a generic solution based on the highest value of any line I know the solution I am using works fine with hard coded scale values and factors.p  pSo onto the questionp  ol liThe height of the container for the line chart is 2.8513inli liThe Y scale currently adapts itself to the maximum value of any line, so for example a maximum value of 1428 would mean the scale would start at 0 and end at 1450 in 10 sections.li liThe lines are drawn by a starting height and and ending height, the starting height is the previous value and the ending height is the current line valueli ol  pWhat I need to work out is some kind of generic formula I am good at maths but not to that level that will work out the correct height for the lines based on the values within the scale for that container height.p  pTo reiterate the scale is worked out dynamically based on the maximum value found but the container height is set.p  pIf anyone can provide any help that would be most welcome.p

Negative 641 pI am trying to develop a spark application on Eclipse, and then debug it by stepping through it. p  pI downloaded the Spark source code and I have added some of the spark sub projectssuch as sparkcore to Eclipse. Now, I am trying to develop a spark application using Eclipse. I have already installed the ScalaIDE on Eclipse. I created a simple application based on the example given in the Spark website. p  precodeimport org.apache.spark.SparkContext import org.apache.spark.SparkContext. import org.apache.spark.SparkConf  object SimpleApp    def mainargs Array[String]      val logFile  YOURSPARKHOMEREADME.md  Should be some file on your system     val conf  new SparkConf.setAppNameSimple Application     val sc  new SparkContextconf     val logData  sc.textFilelogFile, 2.cache     val numAs  logData.filterline gt line.containsa.count     val numBs  logData.filterline gt line.containsb.count     printlnLines with a s, Lines with b s.formatnumAs, numBs     codepre  pTo my project, I added the codesparkcorecode project as a dependent projectright click  build path  add project. Now, I am trying to build my application and run it. However, my project shows that it has errors, but I dont see any errors listed in the problems view within Eclipse, nor do I see any lines highlighted in red. So, I am not sure what the problem is. My assumption is that I need to add external jars to my project, but I am not sure what these jars would be. The error is caused by codeval conf  new SparkConf.setAppNameSimple Applicationcode and the subsequent lines. I tried removing those lines, and the error went away. I would appreciate any help and guidance, thanksp

Negative 641 pWhen i receive a silent push notification on the device. It is blocking the other task running on main thread which is leading to problems for me. My app will be running in background all the time. I also tried using dispatchasync for the other task which is being stopped by silent push then also when the handler method for silent push was hit. It is stopping the normal flow. Is there any solution to this problem.  Any help will be is greatly appreciated.  p  precodedispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH, 0,   1     if initListner  NULL          initListner  [[InitializeListeners alloc]init]          [initListner stopNotifying]     [initListner startNotifying]     if bgTask  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid          bgTask  [application beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler               [self BackgroundtaskInvalidate]             ]             codepre  pas you can see this when BackgroundtaskInvalidate and the silent push notification hits at the same time this problem is occuringp
Negative 641 pRecently updated to MATLAB 2015 and it changed the way graphics handles are stored I think. p  pI store the handles of various lines on the same graph in a 2d array. In my previous version of MATLAB, any place I didnt fill was just a zero. Now that array is a graphics array and unfilled locations are GraphicsPlaceholder. Is there any way to search the array to find where they arep  pFor example, my list of handles is as followsp  precode    P     2x7 graphics array    Columns 1 through 6      Line                   Line                   Line                   Line                   Line                   Line                    GraphicsPlaceholder    GraphicsPlaceholder    GraphicsPlaceholder    GraphicsPlaceholder    Line                   GraphicsPlaceholder codepre  pWhat Id like to do is search and find which column is filled with lines instead of GraphicsPlaceholder.

Negative 641 pCurrently I am trying to expand a d3.js tree which contains over 100,000 nodes. Many leafs exist under multiple parents, as they fit multiple sectionsitemsregions. Searches performed by the user results in the tree opening up to all leafs with that node ID. This can result in the graph trying to open up, on rare occasions, up to 2000 leaf nodes at once.

Negative 641 pI have an app with a scroll view that has a few layers.

However, when there are a lot of drawings on screen, things, such as scrolling and zooming in and out begin to lag quite a bit.p  pI know about reusing views when scrolling, but sometimes if a user say zooms out, many drawings can be on screen at the same time.

Negative 641 ptldr belowp  pIm writing a program containing several JFormattedTextFields and JTextAreas. You can imagine it like a simple form.p  pUsually, when youre inside a JFormattedTextField an press emtabem, the next JFormattedTexFieldJTextArea gets the focus or the previous JFormattedTexFieldJTextArea gets the focus when you press emshift  tabem. This behaviour is just fine. My problem is, that this doesnt work for the JTextAreas. The first solution I had in my mind for this was a KeyListener which looks like thisp  precodeprivate class MultiKeyPressListener implements KeyListener      private final SetltIntegergt pressed     private final JComponent prev     private final JTextArea current     private final JComponent next      public MultiKeyPressListenerSetltIntegergt pressedKeys, JComponent prev, JTextArea current, JComponent next          super         this.pressed  pressedKeys         this.prev  prev         this.current  current         this.next  next           Override     public synchronized void keyPressedKeyEvent e          pressed.adde.getKeyCode         if pressed.size  1              if pressed.containsKeyEvent.VKTAB                  next.requestFocusInWindow                       else if pressed.size  2              if pressed.containsKeyEvent.VKSHIFT ampamp pressed.containsKeyEvent.VKTAB                  prev.requestFocusInWindow                                 Override     public synchronized void keyReleasedKeyEvent e          pressed.removee.getKeyCode           Override     public void keyTypedKeyEvent e          current.setTextcurrent.getText.replaceAllt,        codepre  pThe variable codepressedKeyscode is shared between all JTextAreas. I also tried it without sharing which doesnt really matter. In both cases there are some problems.p  pBasically it seems fine, but theres a problem if you want to jump three textfields upwards for example. Lets imagine youre in a JFormattedTextField and above it is a JTextArea you want to jump to. You press emshiftem and then emtabem. Now youre inside the JTextArea and youre already pressing emshiftem, which results in a KeyListener not recognising the pressed emshiftembutton, because its already pressed down. Therefore, if you press emtabem now still keeping the emshiftembutton pressed from before, you jump to the textfield below instead to the textfield above because the emshiftembutton isnt recognised.p  pMy idea to solve this would be quite simple, although I cant find out, if theres even a method for it. Every time emtabem is pressed, I check, if emshiftem is pressed as well. Therefore I need a function which returns all currently pressed keys. In this case, the code would look like thisp  precodeOverride public synchronized void keyPressedKeyEvent e      if e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKTAB          if Keys.getAllPressedKeys.containsKeyEvent.VKSHIFT              prev.requestFocusInWindow          else              next.requestFocusInWindow                codepre  pIs there something like this Or is there any other way to solve this I mean... I could add this listener too all textfields I use for the form, but that would be quite unhandy.p  pstrongtldrstrong Is there a way to change the focus by pressing emtabememshifttabem when using a JTextArea so it behaves the same like a JTextFieldJFormattedTextField does when programming something similar to a formp

Negative 641 pIn my app I have to receive and process some data from device, connected through COM port. I do it partially. In that particular device first two bytes are the length of the packet minus 2 since it doesnt take into account these very two bytes so it is length of the rest of the packet after all. Then, since I know that device tends to send me its data slowly, I read rest of the packet in the loop, until all data has been read. But right here I encountered strange problem. Lets assume the entire packet including these first two bytes with length looks like this [a, b, c, d, e]. When I read first two bytes a and b, Id expect rest of the packet to look like this [c, d, e]. But instead, it looks like this [b, c, d, e]. How come second byte of the response is still in the read buffer And why just the second one, without the previous onep  pThe code below shows how do I handle the communication processp  precodeThe data array is some array with output data The size array is twobyte array to store framelength bytes The results array is for devices response The part array is for part of the response thats currently in read buffer port.Writedata, 0, data.Length Receiving devices response if theres any try      port.Readsize, 0, 2 Read first two bytes packets length of the response     Well store entire response in results array.

Negative 641 pIm trying to compute a certain subset of the full outer product of codencode vectors.

Negative 641 pOur IIS Redirects are not working with ColdFusion 11.  IIS 8.5 on Win2012 redirects work fine only if there are no ColdFusion files specified in the URL. p  pThe redirects are specified to redirect to a specific URL, to redirect to the exact destination, and to send an HTTP Response code of 301 Permanent Redirect.p  pHowever, with a .cfm file on the URL, the response is The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred. The HTTP Response Code is 500 Internal Server Error. The web logs shows it as a 404.0 File Not Found error.p  pIf we add the missing .cfm file, the .cfm file gets processed ... thus, there is no redirect. It seems that the Connector is taking over before IIS can respond and process the Redirect.p  pAny ideas thank youp

Negative 641 pIm currently designing a basic Java program that uses sockets to communicate from a server to multiple clients. I want the clients to be unmodified, however, to prevent against users trying to use the software not how it was intended.

Negative 641 pI am making a game in visual basic 2010 and have almost completed it except for one problem that i have encountered in regards to using global variables. I have set them up in a module as shown belowp  precodeModule Module1 Public Structure Maths     Public accuracy As Integer     Public speed As Integer     Public vision As Integer End Structure  Public Mathsprogress As Maths End Module codepre  pWhat i am trying to do with these variables is use them within one form to store values so i can transfer those values to a second form. To do this, i have created nested if statements which should set the value of the variable codemathsprogress.accuracy  xcode depending on the value of incorrect.p  precode  CONTINUED   Else  incorrect  incorrect  1           If incorrect  0 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  10         ElseIf incorrect lt 2 And incorrect gt 0 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  9         ElseIf incorrect  3 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  8         ElseIf incorrect  4 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  7         ElseIf incorrect  5 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  6         ElseIf incorrect  6 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  5         ElseIf incorrect  7 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  4         ElseIf incorrect  8 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  3         ElseIf incorrect  9 Then             Mathsprogress.accuracy  2         Else             Mathsprogress.accuracy  1         End If      End If codepre  pBut for some unknown reason, when i use the variable in the second form which is supposed to show the value of mathsprogress.accuracy in a progressbar, it says that the Value of 0 is not valid, it must be between the minimum and maximum which makes me think that the value stored from the IF statement is not being transferred to this third form. The code in the third form isp  precode Private Sub pbaccuracyClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles pbaccuracy.Click     pbaccuracy.Value  Mathsprogress.accuracy End Sub codepre  pI know that the variables are set up correctly because it works when i set mathsprogress.accuracy  10 within the form load of the first form. My problem may lie in where i have placed the chunk of IF statements, can anyone explainp  pThanksp

Negative 641 pSpriteKit is automatically pausing my app when it goes into the background.  This is fine, except it stays paused when the app becomes active again. Im trying to unpause the game in the appropriate application events, to no avail. Im manually unpausing the two codeSKViewscode and the game codeScenecode that constitute the app. From inside the AppDelegate filep  precodefunc applicationWillEnterForegroundapplication UIApplication       if let vw  self.window.rootViewController          let gc  vw as GameViewController         let parView  gc.view as SKView         parView.paused  false         gc.gameView.pausedfalse         gc.gameScene.pausedfalse         printlnpaused  gc.gameScene.paused          func applicationDidBecomeActiveapplication UIApplication       if let vw  self.window.rootViewController          let gc  vw as GameViewController         let parView  gc.view as SKView         parView.paused  false          gc.gameView.pausedfalse         gc.gameScene.pausedfalse         printlnpaused  gc.gameScene.paused         codepre  pAt the end I print the pause state. If I hit the devices codeHomecode key and then return to the app, it prints codefalsecode as desired. However, somewhere not by my code this is being immediately set back to codetruecode, and the game remains paused.  p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI overrode the scenes codepausedcode property, and it is definitely being set back to codetruecode after I unpause in the given events. Confusing, because from reading other questions, the typical behavior of sprite kit is to automatically emunpauseem the game when the app is reactivated. Yet its doing the exact opposite for me.p

Negative 641 pMy ToDo app already had add and delete from Core Data functionality. That worked perfect. My problem is that my attempt to add editing is malfunctioning.p  pstrongBehaviorstrongp  pI coded it so if the user taps a task in the table, it sets that tasks cell index path, title, and description to variables and passes them to the modal ViewController for editing. The modal view presents and those passed variables then populate the textfields. The user can then edit the existing content and hit save which runs some save code Ill share below. The modal view is dismissed, the table data reloaded and the cell appears just where it was before but with updated content. THIS ALL WORKS. The malfunction happens upon a closefull shutdown of the app and reopening it. Suddenly the original task is back BUT a copy with the edits is appended to the bottom of the list. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhy is my code doing this and how can I get the edited title and description to save and load correctlyp  pstrongInformationstrongp  pMy core data file name is CDModel My entity name is TodayTask My attribute names are 1 name 2 descp  pstrongCodestrongp  pI included a lot of my code in case the error is somewhere I dont expect.

I dont ask for the entire solution, I would only like to know how to write something that does read strings but not any given spaces or capital letters.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 641 pI am currently looking for a way around an apparent memory leak in the Mac implementation of the REST client. The code to generate the memory leak is the following running XE8, update 1p  precodeprogram macRESTleaktest APPTYPE CONSOLE R .res  uses   System.SysUtils, REST.Client, REST.Types, IPPeerClient  var    request  TRestRequest    ii, iMax  integer begin    iMax  1     for ii  0 to iMax do    begin       request  TRestRequest.Createnil        Fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping        request.Client  TRestClient.Createhttpjsonplaceholder.typicode.com       request.Method  rmPOST       request.Execute        request.Client.Free       request.Free    end end. codepre  pThis is the smallest block of code that demonstrates the leak. Essentially, I have a synching service that makes REST requests every so often.p  pWhen I run this on Windows, using MadExcept, no leaks are found. Examining the running process in ProcessMonitor shows no increase in the amount of memory being used.p  pWhen run on a Mac, however, the Activity Monitor shows the memory allocated to the app continue to rise. Further, when run using Instruments, there appear to be leaks dealing with several URL and HTTP classes on mac.p  pDoes anybody know how to resolve this leak p  pAs an aside, it would be really helpful to know exactly where the leak is coming from on Mac, but the only Delphi classes listed are the TMethodImplementationIntercept. Im to believe that this is due to the fact that Delphi doesnt generate a dSYM file for Mac. If anybody knows a way around that, that would be awesome toop  pstrongUPDATEstrong By varying codeiMaxcode from 1 to 10 and comparing the FastMM4 output, it appears that the leak is in the class codeMacapi.ObjectiveC.TConvObjID.XFormcode. The 10 iteration output contains 9 more leaks with this as a stack trace compared to the 1 iteration. I have reported this to Embarcadero as RSP12242.p
Negative 641 pI need to write a recursive method using Java called power that takes a double x and an integer n and that returns xn.

However, I am trying to go the extra mile and perform the following optional exercise  p  pOptional challenge you can make this method more efficient, when n is even, using xn  xn22.p  pI am not sure how to implement that last formula when n is even.  I do not think I can use recursion for that.  I have tried to implement the following, but it also does not work because I cannot take a double to the power of an int.p  precodeif n2  0         return xn22 codepre  pCan somebody point me in the right direction  I feel like I am missing something obvious.
