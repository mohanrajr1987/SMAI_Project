Positive 70885 pI am trying to build a charting application using svg and d3 for desktop now, but might start supporting mobile later. The chart has multiple components like comments which can be rich text and images at various zindex embedded into the application.p  pI wanted to keep the chart pure svg, so that I might not get inconsistencies when implementing a feature in the future because part of it is svg and part of it is HTML foreign object.p  pI was compelled to use foreign object when I had to display a rich text comment, and as I progress there are places where using foreign object would make it a lot less painful implementation tables, tooltips.

Load it in Chrome, everything works. Load it in IE11, everything is truncated.

Positive 70885 pI want to visualize events on the globe in real time. I have data lat, longs coming in continuously and I want to be able to send that data json of latitude and longitude to my d3 script and plot with transition the latitude, longitude on the map. I know how to draw a map using d3. Only problem is I am confused as to how can I make an strongendpointstrong in d3HTML which when hit can update the visual. Also, there can be numerous responses in each second so how wil I be able to handle multiple requests at the same time. p  pI think architecture of this system is getting too complicated for me. Any suggestion will be really helpful.p

I can access the children data and children of children data and would only need a recursive function to change the color, however what I cannot seem to access is the rect element associated with each child.

To hit that breakpoint I just click on a blue box in the graph and from there what I want is to be able to select the rect or the g elements associated to the one I clicked.p  pAgain, I now I can do d.children[0] to get the data for the first child, but I do not know from there how to accessedit it css to change the color of its fill.p  pAny help will be appreciated, also, I know I might not have given the best explanation, Ill gladly answer any question or try to clarify any confusion.p  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 70885 pI have used the sample from D3 brush snapping, ttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock6232537. All is working well with its 38 ticks, strange thing is that once the brush move to position 14extent0[0] to 30extent0[1], user can not move the end brush extent0[1]any more the cursor does not change to the dragbrush position as if the browser is not rendering the mouse event. However user can click anywhere on the brush to create a new extent pair for the brush. I googled some performance topic on the brush and some posts mentioned that if there are too many svg elements on the page, it could cause some lagging on the browserFirefox rendering, just to add that Im using chrome only.  Anyone has similar experience or any suggestions p

Lets look at the next criteria. Each logical group is split by a blank row, so the easiest way is to find the next page break, step back until you find the next blank line and insert the new break. Rinse and repeat.p  pSo why does the original run through multiple times We can improve that too the boiler plate outside the loops is the same.p  precodeDim i As Long Dim oPageBreak As HPageBreak Do While i lt shtDeliveryVariance.HPageBreaks.Count  1     i  i  1     pctProgress.ProgressText  Setting Page Break  amp CStri amp  of  amp CStrshtDeliveryVariance.HPageBreaks.Count      Set oPageBreak  shtDeliveryVariance.HPageBreaks.Itemi       select the page break     RangeoPageBreak.Location.Address.Select     ActiveCell.Offset1, 0.Activate       move up to a free row     Do While Not ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1           ActiveCell.Offset1, 0.Activate     Loop      Add the page break     If ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 ltgt Site ID Then         ActiveCell.Offset1, 0.Activate         shtDeliveryVariance.HPageBreaks.Add ActiveCell     End If  Loop codepre  pOne pass and more elegant too. But how much quicker is it On the small test is takes 54 seconds compared to the original 45 seconds, and on the larger test my code is slower again at 153 to 130 seconds.

Negative 70885 pI am trying to call DeviceIoControl from C for codeIOCTLDVDcode control codes.  Having read a lot of information and trying a number of examples I have not made much progress.p  pWhat I am trying to eventually do is get a codeDVDLAYERDESCRIPTORcode structure about the media currently in the DVD drive.  I can call codeCreateFilecode successfully on the DVD device, but when I try to call codeDeviceIoControlcode with the control code codeIOCTLDVDSTARTSESSIONcode it returns a success code but I dont seem to get the sessionId value back successfully, always returns 0.  And any attempt I have then made to try getting the layer description with codeIOCTLDVDREADSTRUCTUREcode fails, i.e. function fails or returns success but gives a blank output structure.p  pAfter finding some C code which makes similar calls I was able to compile this code using Visual C 2008 Express Edition and it successfully is able to start a session, read the codeDVDLAYERDESCRIPTORcode, and close the session without problem so I know this works.p  pThe C issues appear to relate to how the external function is defined and the parameters marshalled.  And how the various structures that are passed and returned are defined.  p  pI have looked at www.pinvoke.net for how they define it, and have used some of the example code and definitions given but still have the same issues as outlined above.  Part of the problem seems to be that for each IOCTL control code the parameters are different, mostly structs, but for codeIOCTLDVDSTARTSESSIONcode the output value is a 32 bit integer.  How can an extern method in C be defined to handle these different cases  Also various structs, defined with the right sized member types, show they are different sizes between the C and C code, but the individual members are the same sizesp  pIf I use a program like codeDeviceIOViewcode and watch the calls made by both the C code and C code for codeIOCTLDVDSTARTSESSIONcode the C version returns a sessionid of 3 and DeviceIOView shows the data being sent back when running the C code is also 3 so there seems to be some sort of Marshalling issue of the returned parameters as we only see 0 in the C codep  pDoes anyone have any ideas or working example code on how to call DeviceIoControl from C to access DVD information  Showing how the structures and function should be defined and used.

I am collecting data from two a hrefhttpwww.instronics.comsensoronixhalleffectzerospeedsensor.html relnofollowhalleffect speed sensorsa, which are each aimed at one of two meshed gears, as shown in the following diagramp  pimg srchttpimg291.imageshack.usimg2914905gears.png altmeshed gears and pulse signals p  pstrongnotestrongbr  As a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers110026jaimeJaimea pointed out, the signals in this diagram would actually have identical frequencies. The real hardware has several more gearing stages between the two target gears, some of which are connected by shafts instead of meshed teeth, so I emdoem end up with two square waves that have different frequencies, and the ratio between them is still a constant. I wanted to simplify the diagram to get to the meat of the matter, but it looks like I simplified it too muchbr  strongnotestrongp  pThe speed sensors output a square wave signal whose frequency is directly proportional to the rotational speed of each gear. The rising and falling edges of the square wave occur when the leading and trailing edges of a single gear tooth pass by the sensor.p  pI know how many teeth are on each gear, and based on this information I am able to accurately measure the rotational speed of each gear based on the frequency of the square wave signals.p  pTo measure the frequencies, I have each speed sensor signal connected to a highspeed capture timer pin on the embedded controller. The capture timers automatically detect the rising edges of the square wave signal, load a register with a value that represents the time at which the transition occurred, and trigger an interrupt. The capture points for each signal are indicated in yellow on the diagram. The interrupt service routine looks something like thisp  precodestruct      long previousTime     int frequency  sensors[2]  void CaptureTimerInterruptint channel, long transitionTime      long timeDifference  transitionTime  sensors[channel].previousTime     sensors[channel].frequency  CONVERSIONFACTOR  timeDifference     sensors[channel].previousTime  transitionTime  codepre  pstrongWhat I would like to dostrong  p  pI would like to be able to detect small differences in the emrelativeem timing of these two square wave signals. I call this the phase difference for lack of a better term. If the two signals had the exact same frequency, this would be straightforward, and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPhasewavesPhasedifference relnofollowphase differencea would be the correct term to use.p  pHeres what Im getting at If I were to record the two signals over a long period of time, and then artificially slow down or stretch out the high speed blue signal by a factor of 169, it would have the exact same frequency as the lower speed red signal, and the two signals would have some measurable phase difference, i.e. the time difference between a red signal interrupt and a blue signal interrupt. I would like to compute this same time difference or something equivalent without having to record the signals over a long period of time. Resources are limited on the embedded controller, so storing large arrays of past transition times is not an option.p  pHas anyone run into this before The actual project has several such gear and sensor arrangements, so Im looking for an elegant algorithm that I can reuse.

However as I say there are issues with copying the data, and so until I report those to the developers, and if they then fix the issue, all I can get are noninteractive screenshots.p  pSo I ask the SO community how they are using the above tools, or if they know of any other easy to use tools for measuring IE7 Javascript memory leaks, that I can use in preparing reports for management, e.g. from which you can export raw data.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 70885 pIm trying to setup the tab keyboard control options on my current WPF project in xaml.p  pEssentially, Ive got a TextBox element within a view, within another view, within another view.  Anyway, when pushing tab on the keyboard, it starts cycling through various elements of the container views and eventually goes to the TextBox I need it to go to.  Im hoping to make it start at this text box, and Im hoping there is an easy way to accomplish this.p  pI tried setting KeyboardBinding.TabNavigation settings, as well as TabIndex options, but these arent working in the way Im trying to get.p  pFrom what I understand so far, Im worried I may need to go to the container views and set up a binding property on each of the ItemControls individually and then it would use the local tabbing settings for each child element.p  pAnyway, Im hoping there is a more efficient way.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 70885 pWere developing JavaSpringSource applications with Eclipse on 32bit Vista machines with 4GB RAM.  The OS exposes roughly 3.3GB of RAM due to reservations for hardware etc. in the virtual address space.  I came across several Ramdisk drivers that can create a virtual disk from the OShidden RAM and am looking for suggestions how best to use the 740MB virtual disk to speed development in our environment.p  pThe slowest part of development for us is compiling as well as launching SpringSource dm Server.p  pOne option is to configure Vista to swap to the Ramdisk.  That works, and noticeably speeds up development in low memory situations.  However, the 3.3GB available to the OS is often sufficient and there are many situations where we do not use the swap files much.p  pAnother option is to use the Ramdisk as a location for temporary files.  Using the Vista mklink command, I created a hard link from where the SpringSource dm Servers work area normally resides to the Ramdisk.  That significantly improves server startup times but does nothing for compile times.  There are roughly 500MB still free on the Ramdisk when the work directory is fully utilized, so room for plenty more.p  pWhat other filesdirectories might be candidates to place on the Ramdisk  Eclipserelated files  Parts of the JDKp  pIs there a freeopen source tool for Vista that will show me which files are used most frequently during a period of time to reduce the guessworkp

Negative 70885 pIve run into something strange about the effect of large memory allocations on the scalability of the .Net runtime. In my test application I create lots of strings in a tight loop for a fixed number of cycles and spit out a rate of loop iterations per second. The weirdness comes in when I run this loop in several threads  it appears that the rate does not increase linearly. The problem gets even worse when you create large strings.p  pLet me show you the results. My machine is an 8gb, 8core box running Windows Server 2008 R1, 32bit. It has two 4core Intel Xeon 1.83ghz E5320 processors. The work performed is a set of alternating calls to codeToUppercode and codeToLowercode on a string.

The columns in the table below arep  ul listrongRatestrong The number of loops across all threads divided by the duration.li listrongLinear Ratestrong The emidealem rate if performance were to scale linearly.

Negative 70885 pIm running an application that kicks off a Rufus Scheduler process in an initializer. The application is running with Passenger in production and Ive noticed a couple weird behaviorsp  pFirst, in order to restart the server and make sure the initializer gets run, you have to both codetouch tmprestart.txtcode and load the app in a browser. At that point, the initializer fires. The horrible thing is that if you only do the touch, the processes scheduled by Rufus get reset and arent rescheduled until you load the app in a browser. p  pThis alone I can deal with. But this leads to the second problem Ill notice that the scheduled process hasnt run, so I load a page and suddenly the log file is telling me that its running the initializers as if Id rebooted. So, at some point, Passenger is randomly rebooting as if Id touched tmprestart.txt and wiping out my scheduled processes.p  pI have an incredibly poor understanding of Passenger and Railss integration, so I dont know whether this occasional rebooting is aberrant or all part of the architecture. Can anyone offer any wisdom on this situationp

Negative 70885 pI have an application which runs on a UINavigationController. Now I would like to add a UIToolbar element to the bottom of each screen. The Toolbar on the bottom should the be customizable for the ViewController that is currently being displayed. My first idea was to simply add the toolbar to the navigationController view and tag it, in the viewController I thought I would then be able to retrieve the UIToolbar element. I have the following codep  pIn my AppDelegatep  precode Get instance of Toolbar  navController is an instance of UINavigationController and TOOLBARTAG a constant UIToolbar toolbar  [[UIToolbar alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 440, 320, 40] toolbar.tag  TOOLBARTAG [navController.view addSubviewtoolbar] codepre  pIn my viewController I tried thisp  precodeUIToolbar toolbar  [self.navigationController.view viewWithTagTOOLBARTAG] toolbar.barStyle  UIBarStyleBlack codepre  pYet this gives me an error saying that toolbar in my case is a UILayoutContainerView object, not an UIToolbar object.

Bs relationship to A is called myAs and is a tomany relationship with Nullify as the Delete Rule.

Users will not have access to B objects directlythey are created and deleted via A objects. Therefore, my rule that B objects are to be deleted when there are no more A object associated with it must be enforced from the A objecthence the cascade on delete.p  pThe problem is that when I delete an A object, the validateForDelete is called on the B object because of the cascade. I am getting an resolved error Unresolved error null, null because I am not calling the validateForDelete manually.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pHow do I access the validateForDelete call from a cascading delete programmatically so that I can pass in an error variable andor handle a validateForDelete result of FALSE p  pIf the above is not possible, how should I be handling this use case Is there another more practical way of achieving thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 70885 pSo... what is the truth about 302 redirects and where is someone with empirical evidence that proves that clean 302 redirects from one site to another does not carry link juicep  pRecently, Ive had overlay frantic people I link to wanting me to change my links to be direct rather than redirects.  I have a hightraffic and wellindexed site all pure white hat, not a drop of shady SEO.  Every single outbound link on my site gets passed through a click tracker.  The redirects are 302 and clean.  Ive had things set up this way for a decade without any issues.  In fact if it werent for my click tracking over the years, I wouldnt know which links my visitors like best the same way, for example, Google determines Quality Score on AdWords and wouldnt have been able to optimize my site to have quality links.p  pI do understand there is still residual fear from 20042005 when Google Jacking was discovered, but Google fixed that.  I understand also that Google wont pass juice on samesite 302 redirects, which makes perfect sense since Google will NOT want to index essentially 2 pages which are intended to be the same resource.  However, in the case of offsite links for which there is a nonexisting redirect URL inbetween, I fail to see what people are freaking out about nor do I believe nor has it been proven that Google does not pass link juice with such linking strategies.  In fact it would be outright preposterous for Google to not treat offsite redirects where the URL doing the redirecting doesnt actually exist except to redirect as anything other than a 301 which has been proven to pass juice.p  pI understand that anyone on either side of the debate will have reasoning, claims, maybe even ambiguous references to quotes from people in the know, but there has never been a drop of conclusive or empirical evidence.  From my own research and observations, Ive found that my linking methods are seen by Google as equivalent to direct links, to the point even where Im nearly 100 certain link juice is also being passed.  However, I dont have anything online I can point to to calm the people down who believe the opposite.p  pI would love to see proof, somewhere, by someone whos done scientific testing of this.p  pAlso, in the meantime, what is a webmaster supposed to do to track outbound clicks while not causing irrational reasoning by people he links to  The only thing those people go by are their SEO experts who they pay, and of course a lot of SEO experts just parrot what they hear from others and depend on fear rather than knowhow to sell their services.p

Negative 70885 pWe all know how sparsely documented ObjectiveC is. I cant find anything on this, but Im also finding it hard to find suitable unambiguous search terms. So, Stackoverflow to the rescue I hopep  pI have a C class that I have an instance of within an ObjectiveC class and I have the project setting enabled for constructors destructors to be called.p  pThis all works fine until I try to expose the instance via a codesynthesizecoded property. I make it an codeassigncode property as ObjC retain counting is not applicable. The property appears to work except when I set the instance I would expect the copy constructor to be involved. What I actually see is that a temporary instance is created the copy constructor on emthatem is invoked  which is all expected. But the copy constructor on the ivar instance is emnotem called. The values are magically set. Im presuming that the codesynthesizecoded code is doing something like a codememcpycode as the final step. This is fine for C codestructcodes, but not so helpful for C codeclasscodees where the correctness of the code depends on the copy constructors and assignment operators being called appropriately.p  pHas anyone looked into this in any more depth, got it working, or confirmed that it is not possible to hold C objects as ivars in an ObjC class and have copy constructors called by codesynthesizecoded property settersp  pI can post sample code for all this if necessary  but even the minimal version is a screenful or so.p

If both maxStatements                  and maxStatementsPerConnection are zero, statement caching will not be enabled.                  If maxStatements is zero but maxStatementsPerConnection is a nonzero value,                  statement caching will be enabled, but no global limit will be enforced,                  only the perconnection maximum. maxStatements controls the total number                  of Statements cached, for all Connections. If set, it should be a fairly                  large number, as each pooled Connection requires its own, distinct flock                  of cached statements. As a guide, consider how many distinct PreparedStatements                  are used frequently in your application, and multiply that number by maxPoolSize                  to arrive at an appropriate value. Though maxStatements is the JDBC standard                  parameter for controlling statement caching, users may find c3p0s alternative                  maxStatementsPerConnection more intuitive to

Negative 70885 pI am still fairly new to Ccli and am not always sure when I am writing something whether I am doing something that creates a transition between managed and unmanaged run times. For instance I cannot add a LARGEINTEGER or a stdvector as a member of a managed class, but I can use either in the middle of a managed method, but I dont know whether doing so creates a transition between managed and unmanaged runtimes. How can I see every point at which I am forcing a transition to be made and how can I measure the cost of those transitionsp  pOne possibility that occurs to me is that I expect there is a transition to unmanaged and a transition to managed block of code in windows. Are there symbols for those I can put breakpoints at, e.g. with windbg so I can see each transition Is there a way to get visual studio to show you each transition at runtimep  pTo measure the inpact when there are many transitions, are there corresponding event tracing for windows events that I can see with xperf, or performance counters for them I can see with perfmonp

Negative 70885 pI have a website idea that Im very excited about, and I love Python. So, Im interested in using Django. However, I started learning Python in version 3.1, and Django currently only supports various 2.x versions. Ive searched for information about when Django will start supporting Python 3.x, and gotten mostly articles from a year or two ago that say it will take a year or two. Meanwhile, the Django FAQ says that there are no immediate plans.p  pIm reluctant to build in an old version of Python and then either be stuck with it or go through a huge ordeal trying to migrate later. My original solution to this was to start learning PHP instead and then choose a framework, but as it turns out I dont really like PHP. Django it is, then.p  pIf I decide to wait for a 3.xcompatible version, I can teach myself more frontend web development and more Python in the meantime. Ive only been at this for a few months so I have a lot to learn. But I dont want to wait forever, and I realize that even after a 3.xcompatible version comes out it will take a while for thirdparty APIs to catch up. What do you all recommendp

Negative 70885 pI am going to let new users register on my service. Here is the way I think it should go 1. User enters his email in a field and clicks Register button. 2.

How do I better generate that code Should I generate it when the user clicks Register button and save it in the field, say verificationcode near the field email and then when he goes to the verification link, compare the values Then, if thats fine, clear the verificationcode field and set userisactive field to True. Or may be I dont have to keep that code in the database at all, but make a just in time verification with some algorithm May be there are other things I should considerp

Negative 70885 pI need to pretty print some output of make via XSLT xsltproc, with a focus on easy readability of the gcc calls because they are the most common and important lines in said output.p  pSituation I have a lot of long codeltmessagegtgcc Wall ...ltmessagegtcode nodes in my source XML file, one line of raw makefile output per codeltmessagegtcode node. The output of my XSLT sheet would be HTML, putting the contents of the codeltmessagegtcode nodes line by line into a codeltpregtcode environment. Id like to break the string preferably on any codecode occurence i.e. on the start of a command line parameter  if that is not found, on some characters like code.code, then on any whitespace breaking the string in the middle of a string should be the last resort. I have set a global variable codebreakatcode denoting the maximum characters per line.p  pProblem I cannot use XSLT 2.0 functions on xsltproc or I did not find any information regarding importing them. Therefore Im stuck with codesubstringbeforecode, codesubstringaftercode, codecontainscode, codesubstringcode, codestringlengthcode sadly, codetokenizecode is not available. I do not seem to find a way to break the string on the last occurence of whitespace or any token right before codebreakatcode.p  pThis is an excerpt of the source XMLp  precodeltmessage priorityinfogtlt[CDATA[usrbinmoc DQTNODEBUG DQTGUILIB DQTCORELIB DQTSHARED Iusrshareqt4mkspecslinuxg I.

Negative 70885 pIm looking for a simple easytouse client side upload validator. It doesnt need to handle the upload itself this is being handled fine by POST and a server side script.p  pIve looked into a fair bit, and its clear it cant be done with js alone. Other solutions recommend use of activeX which seems to have inconsistent results on different browsers.p  pFlash is a obvious favourite, but the flash solutions such as a hrefhttpwww.uploadify.com relnofollowUPLOADIFYa and a hrefhttpwww.swfupload.org relnofollowSWFUploadera seem to bundled with ajax uploaders and progress bars. This is likely to disrupt my existing form and server side processing scripts, so Im just looking for a simple mechanism to validate the file either on blur or change on the file input, or on submission of the form. But I dont want the validator to do anything other than provide validation in order that my existing upload scripts continue to work as they are at the moment.p  pIs this too much to ask forp  pThanks.p

Negative 70885 pI started playing with Blueprint CSS tonight and things are going pretty well. Up until I started to use the .box class, and adding a dropshadow to it. I ended up creating my own class to apply the shadows, but now my column count seems to be off. Instead of the normal 24 columns, I can only use 23. If i use 24 columns, the overflow turns on and I get scroll bars.p  pThe reason I made my own class was because if i applied the shadows to the .box class, I would run into the overflow issue. I did some research and found that I needed to create a child div for the box class. If i removed my shadows, things worked great. p  pBoth the CSS and the HTML are located here a hrefhttppastie.org1608550 relnofollowhttppastie.org1608550ap  pI can move forward as is, but Im concerned this will cause issues down the road.p

Negative 70885 pI guess this is more about SEO than wanting to support browsers with Javascript disabled.  I have JavascriptjQuery code that reads in some html and basically displays it much nicer.

Negative 70885 pIm currently facing a performance problem with creating POCO objects from my database. Im using Entity Framework 4 as ORMapper. The whole application is a prototype for now.p  pLets assume I want to have some business objects like classes Printer or Scanner. Both classes inherit from a BaseClass called Product. The business classes exist.p  pI try to use a more generic database approach. I dont want to create tables for Printer nor Scanner. I want to have 3 tables One called Product, and the other Property and PropertyValue which stores all assigned values to a specific Product.p  pIn my business layer I do create a specific object like thisp  precodepublic Printer GetPrinterint IDProduct    Printer item  new Printer    get the product object with EF    get all PropertyValues    with Reflection foreach property in item.GetType.GetProperties          property.SetValuespecific value       return item  codepre  pThis is how the EF model looks like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrwADO.png altenter image description herep  pWorks fine so far. For now Im doing performance tests for retrieving multiple sets.p  pIve created a prototype and improved it several times to increase the performance. It is still far away from being usable. I takes 919ms to create 300 objects who only contain 3 properties.p  pThe reason for choosing such DB design is to have a generic database design. Adding new properties should only be done in the business model.p  pAm I just being too stupid to create a performant way of retrieving xx objects or is my approach totally wrong As far as I understand ORMapper, they are basically doing the samep

Negative 70885 pWe are currently migrating all our solutions from 2005 to 2010 thats right, were skipping 2008. We are also changing our file structure to make some more sense some common projects would be nested within specific projects etc etc.p  pThis all means references need to be changed Apart from that we are also setting them all to .NET 4.0. To accomplish this weve made a temp GOD solution with all 117 projects in the same solution.p  pI am doing this with one coworker and until about 2 hours ago everything was going according to plan. However we ran into a problem with one of the 117 projects. This project refuses to display its references, resources, services, and settings tabs within the Project Properties.p  pI get the following exact messagep  blockquote   pCould not resolve mscorlib for target   framework   .NETFramework,Versionv4.0. This can   happen if the target framework is not   installed or if the framework moniker   is incorrectly formatted.p blockquote  pNow this is annoying but it gets worse. My coworker, when getting the same solution from subversion, CAN actually see and change the references and things. As a matter of fact, currently the project actually BUILDS on his machine. He committed the changes but I cant build this specific project, or see the references.p  pWhich leads me to the simple conclusion, something has to be different on my client which is causing trouble Suggestions online that Ive seen are the followingp  ul liMultiple .NET4.0 versions installed this is not the case on my clientli li.NET v3.5 is not installed v4.0 is trying to build v3.5 3.5 is installed on my clientli liThe registery key OnlyUseLatestCLR is set and is screwing things up scanned my registry, this key is not present anywhereli ul  pSee a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails542789 relnofollowhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails542789ap  pThe only thing I havent tried yet which I could do is repair .NET 4.0 how ever I highly doubt this is the issue since we have about 100 other projects which I can edit and build just fine.

Notice how to grey bar at the top doesnt reach the right of the page content, and the height of the left column doesnt reach the bottom of the page content either.p  pAm I right in thinking this stems from the fact that setting something to 100 height or 100 width via CSS is static  i.e. Whatever the heightwidth of the browser window was when the CSS was called is saved and thats thatp  pIf thats the case, maybe I need to look into some other methods of setting the height and widths of my elements.

Negative 70885 pIve been given the rather daunting task of introducing i18n to a J2EE web application using the 2.3 servlet specification. The application is very large and has been in active development for over 8 years.p  pAs such, I want to get things right the first time so I can limit the amount of time I need to scrawl through JSPs, JavaScript files, servlets and wherever else, replacing hardcoded strings with values from message bundles.p  pThere is no framework being used here. How can I approach supporting i18n. Note that I want to have a single JSP per view that loads text from a properties files and not a different JSP for each supported locale.p  pI guess my main question is whether I can set the locale somewhere in the backend i.e. read locale from user profile on login and store value in session and then expect that the JSP pages will be able to correctly load the specified string from the correct properties file i.e. from messagesfr.properties when the locale is to French as opposed to adding logic to find the correct locale in each JSP.p  pAny ideas how I can approach thisp

Negative 70885 pI originally had all of my modules in one package. I recently created a subpackage in the original package, and moved a few modules into that. My src folder, and the 2 package folders, are all in my PYTHONPATH.p  pSince I relocated those modules, changes that Im making to their .py files dont seem to be making their way into the generated py.class files, which I believe are ultimately what get run, based on what codeprint FILEcode spits out.p  pThe .class files are located in the toplevel packages directory, which I believe is because the first place they are imported from is within a module thats in that package. So I think theyre in the right place.p  pMoving the modules back to the toplevel package does make the problem go away, but being forced to have all modules in one package is hardly a solution. Is there something I have to do to register a module as part of a package, other than having it in a folder with an codeinit.pycodep  pstrongNote The rest of this question is just the symptoms that have caused me to conclude that the .class files are not being updated when I change the .py files.

Negative 70885 pI have been using CakePHP for a while and recently needed to send emails from an app.  Unfortunately I can not figure out a way to tell CakePHP to include the css directly in the document as an internal style sheet instead of a link.  I know people think that is a bad idea, but my app is only sending emails to our company so Im not worried too much about someones email client messing it up.  If I just include the link it doesnt work since the reference is wrong, although if I could make the link an absolute link httpmyservercssmyfile.css instead of cssmyfile.css that would be a 2nd best alternative since they would have access to my server.p  pIf there isnt a way to do it in Cake, is there a quick way to just use PHP to read the contents of the file and dump it in the view  I guess I could do that from the controller, sounds like a bad hack though.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated, thanksp

Negative 70885 pIm inspecting running times, heap memory usage and nonheap memory usage of different algorithms to a specific sorting problem.p  pIve successfully been able to measure running time and heap memory usage, but I have problems measuring nonheap memory usage.p  pWhat I do when I try to measure it is I start a new thread which constantly checks if the nonheap memory has changed while Im running my sorting algorithm. This thread object records the highest value of the memory usage during the running of that algorithm.p  pThis works for ordinary heap memory or at least, I think it works as it provides logical results, but when I try to do the same for the nonheap memory, I seam to get a lot of 0 memory usage results.p  pI use ManagementFactory.memoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed to read the non heap memory and I figured that this memory is not freed when running the garbage collector I run System.gc 16 times to hopefully make the garbage collector collect the garbage before I record the initial memory I know this is only a suggestion, however this shouldnt matter as it doesnt do anything for the nonheap memory anyways i think. Im also guessing that this memory is not freed when things are popped from the stack because my results are largest in the first algorithms tried and therefore I suspect I get only the difference of the nonheap memory usage between each run and 0 if the latter run uses less memory than the former.p  pThis is my memory inspector classp  precodeclass MemoryInspectorThread extends Thread  private int samplingInterval  private long initialMemoryHeap private long initialMemoryNonHeap private long maxMemoryHeap private long maxMemoryNonHeap  private boolean killfalse  void kill      killtrue   long getMaxNewMemoryHeap      return maxMemoryHeapinitialMemoryHeap1024   long getMaxNewMemoryNonHeap      return maxMemoryNonHeapinitialMemoryNonHeap1024   MemoryInspectorThreadint samplingInterval      this.samplingIntervalsamplingInterval      try              sleep1000      catch InterruptedException e              e.printStackTrace           MemoryMXBean memoryMXBeanManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean      System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc     System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc     System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc     System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc      initialMemoryHeapmemoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed     initialMemoryNonHeapmemoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed  Override public void run      MemoryMXBean memoryMXBeanManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean      while kill                 long freeMemoryHeapmemoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed         long freeMemoryNonHeapmemoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed          if freeMemoryHeap gt maxMemoryHeap                      maxMemoryHeapfreeMemoryHeap                   if freeMemoryNonHeap gt maxMemoryNonHeap                      maxMemoryNonHeapfreeMemoryNonHeap                   try                      sleepsamplingInterval          catch InterruptedException e                      e.printStackTrace                 codepre  pHow can I get the actual nonheap memory Are my assumptions about how the thing works correctp

I also defined one on Test.name which does not work unless I make Test and its chiled name, global elements.p  precodeltschema targetNamespacehttpwww.amica.comdevv1Test xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnstnshttpwww.amica.comdevv1Test elementFormDefaultunqualified attributeFormDefaultunqualifiedgt     ltelement nameMyMusicgt         ltcomplexTypegt             ltsequencegt                 ltelement nameSong typetnsSongTypegt             ltsequencegt         ltcomplexTypegt     ltelementgt     ltcomplexType nameSongTypegt         ltsequencegt             ltelement reftnsArtistsgt             ltelement reftnsWritersgt             ltelement nameTestsgt                 ltcomplexTypegt                     ltsequencegt                         ltelement nameTest maxOccursunboundedgt                             ltcomplexTypegt                                 ltsequencegt                                     ltelement namenamegt                                 ltsequencegt                             ltcomplexTypegt                         ltelementgt                     ltsequencegt                 ltcomplexTypegt                 ltunique nameUniqueTestNamegt                     ltselector xpathTestgt                     ltfield xpathnamegt                 ltuniquegt             ltelementgt         ltsequencegt     ltcomplexTypegt     ltelement nameArtistgt         ltcomplexTypegt             ltsimpleContentgt                 ltextension basestringgt                     ltattribute nameaID userequiredgt                         ltsimpleTypegt                             ltrestriction basestringgt                         ltsimpleTypegt                     ltattributegt                 ltextensiongt             ltsimpleContentgt         ltcomplexTypegt     ltelementgt     ltelement nameWritergt         ltcomplexTypegt             ltsequencegt                 ltelement reftnsnamegt             ltsequencegt         ltcomplexTypegt     ltelementgt     ltelement nameArtistsgt         ltannotationgt             ltdocumentationgtTest unique constraint on an attrbuteltdocumentationgt         ltannotationgt         ltcomplexTypegt             ltsequencegt                 ltelement reftnsArtist maxOccursunboundedgt             ltsequencegt         ltcomplexTypegt         ltunique nameUniqueArtistKeygt             ltselector xpathtnsArtistgt             ltfield xpathaIDgt         ltuniquegt     ltelementgt     ltelement nameWritersgt         ltannotationgt             ltdocumentationgtTest unique constraint on an elementltdocumentationgt         ltannotationgt         ltcomplexTypegt             ltsequencegt                 ltelement reftnsWriter maxOccursunboundedgt             ltsequencegt         ltcomplexTypegt         ltunique nameUniqueWriterNamegt             ltselector xpathtnsWritergt             ltfield xpathtnsnamegt         ltuniquegt     ltelementgt     ltelement namename typestringgt ltschemagt codepre

Negative 70885 pI am trying to make an implementation of Breadth First Search also other algorithms, but currently bfs in Javascript.p  pEventually I want to apply all the search algorithms on a grid, to find a path from the start to the goal node I know bfs isnt particularly good at this. I have made an implementation, but the problem is that I do not have the entire tree in advance. What I want is to give it a startnode and endnode and based on that find a path between them.p  pThe problem I am running into is that when I determine the adjacent gridsquares, it returns ALL neighbors, so even the ones that are already traversed. Which turns it into graph search rather than tree search. A way to solve it is to remember all paths so that I can check which neighbors have already been traversed and thus should not need to be examined further. However, as I learned in a course on search algorithms, bfs has a memory usage of all nodes on the current depth level. If I store all the paths, then it consumes much more memory than that right p  pIs it possible to only keep in memory the nodes of the current depth that bfs is searching on, when I dont have the tree structure in advance and still avoid having cyclesp  pI hope I have made my self clear.p  pThanks in advance, Stefanp

Negative 70885 pIs there a simple way to get an codeNSScrollViewcode to adapt to its document view changing size when using auto layoutp  pI have tried to call both codesetNeedsUpdateConstraintscode and codesetNeedsLayoutcode on the document view, the clip view and the scroll view, without any results. p  pcodefittingSizecode of the document view reports the correct size.p  pThe problem is that the document view, which holds subviews, is not resized when the subviews change their size, even if they call codeinvalidateIntrinsicContentSizecode. The contents of the document view are hence clipped to the original size of the document view as they grow. The document view is created in a nib and set as the scroll views document view in an codeawakeFromBibcode method.p  pI was hoping that the document view frame would automatically be adjusted when its codefittingSizecode changes, and the scrollbars updated accordingly. p  pcodeNSPopovercode does something similar  provided that the subviews of the content controllers view have the constraints set right and various content hugging values are high enough higher than the hidden popover windows hight constraint priority, for one.p

Negative 70885 pHeres the scenario. I have a main view whose orientation I want to align with true north.p  pInside this view I have 7 subviews arranged in a heptagonal pattern around the center of the main view. Each of these sub views is essentially the same as the others, so drawing relative to their local coordinates makes the most sense.p  pI thought I would use CGAffineTransformMakeRotation to rotate the subviews by integer multiples of 2MPI7, in order to arrange them properly. So far so good.p  pI also thought I would use CGAffineTransformMakeRotation to rotate the main view according to compass values. To test that, so far Ive just been hard coding values. Thats fine, too.p  pThe problem is, that Im getting behavior that is different from what I expected. I thought the rotation of the subview would be relative to the main view, but it seems to be relative to the window containing the main view instead. Did I have a wrong expectation Will I need to compose the two transformations for the subview rotations Thats fine if I have to do that, but it differs from what I expected, so maybe Im doing something wrong.p  pHere is the code to rotate the main view. I currently have it as the last thing in drawRect for the m file for the main view.p  precode      float angleFromNorth  243.0  MPI         angleFromNorth  0.

Now Ive run into another hurdle. I thought having resolved the above scenario, the next step would be straightforward, but it is turning out to be a challenge. You may wish to follow my link in the comment section to see what the model looks like as rendered by paperpencil andor Google Sketchup. Anyway, the next step is to put towers on the platforms. Ive created a new subclass UIView called Tower, with the intent to put three towers on each platform. The tricky part is that the orientation needs to match true north, i.e., circusView orientation, but the placement needs to align with the platform.p  pTo do this, I created the subviews of self.window in the platform implementation file. I thought by doing it within this file that the coordinates would be relative to this view. And they probably are, before the rotation, come to think of it. But they need to keep the location relative to the rotated platforms but orient aligned with true north. The result will be that rectangles drawn this way on each platform should be placed on the platform the same way for each platform, but the rectangle should be rotated relative to the platform, i.e., not at all relative to the circusView dont ask me why its called circus  left over from converting from another project.p  pAny suggestions Im thinking now Ill have to just initialize the towers the same way I finally got the platforms to work, and then rotate them by the inverse of the platform rotation.p

We have an application that posts messages to facebook rarely it could be years between them ,but the postings are quite important. These postings are initiated within a JVM running tomcat, but are not necessarily initiated by anything a user does.p  pWhen the user installs their version of the application they go through the normal serverside authentication process using a browserp  pa hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthauthorizeclientidAPPIDampscopepublishstream,managepages,offlineaccessampresponsetypetokenampredirecturiMYREDIRECTURL relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthauthorizeclientidAPPIDampscopepublishstream,managepages,offlineaccessampresponsetypetokenampredirecturiMYREDIRECTURLap  pHistorically my application then stores the access token generated which never expired in a database. Now, with the offlineaccess deprecation, this access token is now a shortlived token which apparently can be exchanged to a 60 day token by going to p  pa hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstokenclientidAPIDampclientsecretAPPSECRETampgranttypefbexchangetokenampfbexchangetokenOLDSHORTTOKEN relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstokenclientidAPIDampclientsecretAPPSECRETampgranttypefbexchangetokenampfbexchangetokenOLDSHORTTOKENap  pSo I could go to the above URL and store the longterm access token returned. So far, so good. Heres the problem....p  pAs stated earlier, my application might not try to post to facebook for months or years i.e. after my 60 day token has expired. According to the documentation I can use the fbexchangetoken option to exchange a shortlived token for a 60 day token, but I cant exchange a 60 day token that is about to expire for a new 60 day token. And the only way I have found to get a new shortlived token is by having the user log in and generate it. Thats my problem. As I understand it I cant get the new shortlived token without having a user log in again.p  pI was trying to think of an analogy that would be simpler to understand and this is the best Ive come up with.p  pAssume I have a bash script that runs in cron every 90 days to post a message to a companys facebook page announcing that the quarterly reports are available. In the new, deprecated offlineaccess world how could I make this cron job work The only customerspecific data I store is a 60 day access token and the bash script has no user interface.p  pIf I did the hackiest solution and required the person who installed our application to include their fb username and password as part of the installation how would that even work. Is there a way to provide the username and password to the graph api and then simulate logging in and oauth click streams with something like HttpClientp  pIdeally if I had something like fbexchangetoken option that could exchange a 60day token for a new 60day token I could write something that samples facebook once a day to see how close my 60day token is to expiration and when it gets within a day or two perform a new fbexchangetoken and save the new 60day token.p  pSorry if this is a wordy posting. I tried to get all of the info out there so someone could help without having to ask followup questions.p

After you erase c lastIndex would be set to 1 so its enough to        add 1 to lastIndex to determine vectors length.           int lastIndex  private            Returns the index of the last notnull element in the vector,        starting from position position downwards.             param position the position from which counting is to be begun.       return last element before or on index ltcodegtpositionltcodegt           int FindLastIndexint position          int nLastItem  position          if position lt 0              return 1                   for  nLastItem gt 0 nLastItem              if Baseoperator[]nLastItem  NULL                  break                                return nLastItem       public      FVectorconst T amp value  T      elementCount0, lastIndex1            FVectorint initialCapacity, const T amp value  T      elementCount0, lastIndex1,       stdvectorltTgtinitialCapacity, value            sizet Capacity const          return Basesize           sizet Size const          return elementCount           int LastIndex const          return lastIndex           void AddElementconst Tamp obj          Basepushbackobj          elementCount         lastIndex           T amp ElementAtint index          if index gt lastIndex               error                   return Baseatindex          void EraseElementAtint index throw          if index gt lastIndex              stdstringstream ss             ss ltlt index ltlt  gt  ltlt lastIndex             throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionss.str                   if Baseoperator[]index  NULL              elementCount             T v  Baseatindex             delete v             Baseatindex  NULL              if index  lastIndex                  lastIndex  FindLastIndexlastIndex  1                             codepre  pIt is not working like I expect.

Negative 70885 pThe scenario is we have a WCF service that consumes methods from an internal web service that we have built.p  pThe WCF service is very lightweight.p  pWe want to secure this WCF service so only certain clients can consume it it is currently sitting on a public facing server.p  pWe do not have the ability to install certificates on this public facing server so we are wondering the best securiyt model to use.p  pIdeally the thought was somehow it can be configured so that the client uses a certificate that the WCF service simply passes on to the internal web service as this is on a server we do control and the certificate authentication then happens.p  pIs this possible.. If not are there any other security options that we could employ..p  pThanks in advance.p

It is possible here to chose the webrole instance to be monitored exclusively. This is what i want to do also. Insights on what this page actually does might help also.p  pfor comparison a hrefhttppuu.sh1xp7q relnofollowhttppuu.sh1xp7qap  pThey only stupid way i can think of to get this information is  to get a list of all processes before and after each w3wp is started  identify which one was added and then decide code base context wise which role instance was just started.p

Negative 70885 pI have created a Java app deployed by Java Web Start which needs to use a browser to display HTML5 content. Due to such browser not necessarily being on the user machine, Im bundling a a hrefhttpcrportable.sourceforge.net relnofollowportable versiona of a hrefhttpdev.chromium.org relnofollowChromiuma in my JAR. This has two problemsp  ul liThe Jar is going to be almost 70 MB, Chromium taking up 64 MB.li liThere doesnt seem to be an easy way of creating a communication channel between my app running in the background and the browser window, short of bundling a web server as well, like Jetty or Jibble.li ul  pThe size of Jar isnt such a huge issue, unless it is way over 100 MB. However, the portable Chromium app seems to be windows only and I need to deploy on Mac OS desktops too. At the moment Im launching Chromium in app mode with codeapphttp...code, because I just need a browser window with no interface.p  pSo my question is, is there another browser I could bundle instead of portable chromium Something that would preferably be lighter but it definitely stronghas to support HTML5strong, and that I could control programatically from the Java background app although a bundled webserver is a viable option, not sure how that would play with various firewalls. Maybe there is something lightweight and crossplatform based on WebKitp

Rows are sorted and the user can move rows around.p  precodeusrbinpython   coding utf8   import gtk  window  gtk.Window window.setsizerequest300, 200 window.connectdeleteevent, lambda w,e gtk.mainquit   Define Liblarch Tree  store  gtk.TreeStorestr, str store.insertNone, 1, [A, Task A] store.insertNone, 1, [B, Task B] store.insertNone, 1, [C, Task C] dparent  store.insertNone, 1, [D, Task D] store.insertdparent, 1, [E, Task E]   Define TreeView in similar way as it happens in GTGLiblarchgtk tv  gtk.TreeView  col  gtk.TreeViewColumn col.settitleTitle rendertext  gtk.CellRendererText col.packstartrendertext, expandTrue col.addattributerendertext, markup, 1 col.setresizableTrue col.setexpandTrue col.setsortcolumnid0 tv.appendcolumncol tv.setpropertyexpandercolumn, col  treemodel  store  def sortfuncmodel, iter1, iter2      Sort two iterators by function which gets node objects.

Negative 70885 pI have a color image with number of rows 479 and columns 638. I am trying to save this image as a BMP file. For this I am first using codeCreateDIBSectioncode and then using codeCreateDIBitmapcode. For the codeCreateDIBSectioncode I need to pass the codeBITMAPINFOHEADERcode to the function. Here it has two parameters codebiWidthcode and codebiSizeImagecode. Since the memory returned by the function should be DWORD aligned, and code638code is not a multiple of code4code should I pass 638 or 640 as the width  Assume that I pass 638 as the width, will the memory returned by the function be 638 x 479 or 640 x 479  My observation is that it is the 640 x 479. In this case when I save the file as a BMP a 2 pixel wide black line appears at the end of each row. How do I avoid this I am passing codebiCompressioncode as codeBIRGBcode if that matters.p

Negative 70885 pTo strengthen the authentication mechanism web, I would like to log a user fingerprint for every attempt and apply pattern recognition to distinguish malicious attempts. For example if the user always logs in from European computers and there is an attempt made from China, the user is blocked until the user confirms via email, for example to allow logins from China.p  pI have a very, very small knowledge of pattern recognition from a university course. However, I cannot recall enough to start developing this service. What I know, is you look at various featuresp  ol liBrowser agent string, resulting in ul liOperating systemli liBrowser vendorli ulli liIP address, resulting in ul liLocationli ulli liTime stamp of loginli liNumber of failed attempts within session, or totalli ol  pYou search for patterns and any extraordinary attempt is marked because it does not follow the average pattern. You probably will apply a threshold, so if a user logs in at night or has a new PC, it still works.p  pThere are also a few requirements first, the check of an attempt must be made realtime. You cannot block access after 2 minutes if the credentials were OK but you found out later on the attempt could have been malicious. Furthermore, all our apps are written in PHP, but PHP is probably too slow for this. I prefer to use Python then, but subsequently there is also a binding to Pythin required.p  pSo the question is where to start What is the best approach to accomplish this I can log all data in a key storage like Redis or document based like Mongo. How would I design a service which allows to validate a new attempt with certain features against a bulk of known other attempts And return whether the attempt matches the average within a timely fashion, say 250ms.p

Negative 70885 pI am trying to add a computed column to a table via SSMS  Id rather care not to get into the details on why the base column is a codeVARCHAR10code and not a codeDATEcode and no, Im not interested in changing it.p  pWhen I enter the formula codeCONVERTDATE, [charDob]code in the table designer SSMS reports p  blockquote   pError validating the the formula for column codecharDobTypedcode.p blockquote  pUsing the formula code[charDob]code works as expected, meaning the column is bound correctly. Also the formula codeCONVERTDATE, 2001code works as expected  so there is something with using the column that is causing the error.p  pThe original column is a codeVARCHAR10code and contains NULL values emorem values that are otherwise convertible to codeDATEcode. The query codeSELECT CONVERTDATE,charDob as dob FROM peoplecode works as expected. Also, the error message is about invalid formula and not about a data conversion error, so I dont believe that inconvertible is causing this.p  pI have already saved the table with the new computed column and a dummy value and reconnected to the database  this was to ensure that there was not an odd caching issue occurring, as sometimes occurs. The error persists independent of the persisted flag  if only it were that easy to turn off.p

Negative 70885 pSo as we know an codeItemsControlcode will just generate the Items toptobottom in its ItemsPanel. Where as yes I can change the sort order and generate them in different ways heres my actual problem.p  pIf I have an codeItemsControlcode using an codeItemTemplatecode with multiple codeUIElementcodes and use for example, a codeStackPanelcode as the codeItemsPanelcode I end up with a natural tab order of something likep  precodea. 1  2  3  4  5 b. 6  7  8  9  10 c. 11 12 13 14 15 codepre  pExpected, which I could use either the order of placement or codeFlowDirectioncode on the codeItemTemplatecode to obviously getp  precodea. 5  4  3  2  1 b. 10 9  8  7  6 c. 15 14 13 12 11 codepre  pNow, my question is how could I achieve in the most efficient way an order more likep  precodeC. 11 12 13 14 15 B. 6  7  8  9  10 A. 1  2  3  4  5 codepre  pNow then if youre thinking.. ugh, kbdShiftkbdkbdTabkbd dummy... well I wish it was an option. The requirement is just using tab, and generating the collection in reverse bottom to top instead of top to bottom and having the tab order reversed while theyre in that control. Is it wise to try and hijack the shifttab event and convert it to just tab somehow Even if that were the case it only answers part of my question.p  pHopefully someones ran into this before or enjoys an interesting question so any insight is appreciated.

Negative 70885 pI have a driver that I need to access via a web site that is not threadsafe. Since many people can be on the site at a given time I figured I would create a WCF service that would handle all the calls. Most of the calls would be asynchronous calls to add items to a work queue. Some would be synchronous calls to get a list of items still unprocessed or items that have been processed.p  pSince the driver isnt thread safe, the service must take in potentially many requests at once and either add items to the work queue, return the work queue, or return the workcompleted queue. A singlethreaded operation in the service needs to read from the work queue, processes the job using this nonthreadsafe driver, and, when complete, update the workcompleted queue.p  pWhile I conceptually have clear in my mind what to do, the specifics of implementation confuse me a little. I think I should host the service in IIS since it will have to respond to web requests and otherwise act like any other web site, but Im not sure how to guarantee that the access of the driver will remain singlethreaded without blocking web requests. Do I need a second service, perhaps a Windows service, that would process all access to the driver and use the IIShosted WCF service to get the next queue item and update the queue when processing is completep

Negative 70885 pWhile playing with Boost.Python and C, sometimes we create classes that are bound using the class itself and a codeboostsharedptrltgtcode version. This is very convenient for many reasons and can be used in lots of places. strongHoweverstrong, the mechanism does not seem to work reliably when codeboostpythoncode returns a codeboostsharedptrltgtcode to a value that was produced in Python and is recorded on a C static variable.p  pNormally, Id expect the returned codeboostsharedptrltgtcode to hold a special deleter that would take care of this, but that does not seem to be the case. What seems to happen is that the returned codeboostsharedptrcode just wraps a pointer to a value produced in Python wo any special consideration with deletion. This results in a consistent crash coming from a doubledeletion one from the Python interpreter itself and one from the C static  or at least it looks like it.p  pTo reproduce this behavior using the code below, create a codetest.cccode file like below and test with the following script.p  precodeinclude ltboostpython.hppgt include ltboostsharedptr.hppgt  struct A    stdstring a   Astdstring a aa    stdstring str  return a    static boostsharedptrltAgt holdernew Afoo  static void setholderboostsharedptrltAgt aptr    holder  aptr   static boostsharedptrltAgt getholder    return holder   BOOSTPYTHONMODULEtest    using namespace boostpython    classltA, boostsharedptrltAgt gtA, initltstdstringgt     .defstr, ampAstr         defsetholder, ampsetholder   defgetholder, ampgetholder  codepre  pWith the following Python test programp  precodeimport test printstrtest.getholder test.setholdertest.Abar printstrtest.getholder codepre  pCompiling with codeg Iusrincludepython2.7 shared fpic test.cc lboostpython lpython2.7 o test.socode and running the above program codepython test.pycode under Linux ubuntu 12.10, with Python 2.7 and Boost 1.50, resulted in the following stack tracep  precode0  0x000000000048aae8 in   1  0x00007fa44f85f589 in boostpythonconvertersharedptrdeleteroperatorvoid const  from usrliblibboostpythonpy27.so.1.50.0 2  0x00007fa44fa97cf9 in boostdetailspcountedimplpdltvoid, boostpythonconvertersharedptrdeletergtdispose     from remotefiler.gxhome.activeaanjostest.so 3  0x00007fa44fa93f9c in boostdetailspcountedbaserelease     from remotefiler.gxhome.activeaanjostest.so 4  0x00007fa44fa9402b in boostdetailsharedcountsharedcount     from remotefiler.gxhome.activeaanjostest.so 5  0x00007fa44fa94404 in boostsharedptrltAgtsharedptr     from remotefiler.gxhome.activeaanjostest.so 6  0x00007fa450337901 in runexithandlers status0,      listp0x7fa4506b46a8 ltexitfuncsgt, runlistatexittrue at exit.c78 7  0x00007fa450337985 in GIexit statusltoptimized outgt at exit.c100 8  0x00007fa45031d774 in libcstartmain main0x44b769 ltmaingt, argc2,      ubpav0x7fffaa28e2a8, initltoptimized outgt, finiltoptimized outgt,      rtldfiniltoptimized outgt, stackend0x7fffaa28e298 at libcstart.c258 9  0x00000000004ce6dd in start  codepre  pThis indicates a doubledeletion has occured at the static destructor.

Therefore I used emCreateMockAnythingem which is perfect for this case. I know I can stub module functions withp  precodeself.mox.StubOutWithMockmoduletomock, FunctionToMock  moduletomock.FunctionToMock.AndReturnfoo codepre  pBut I dont like this way because here I need to do two actions each time. Its simpler and prettier to have a reference to the module in the class, and mock it with emCreateMockAnythingem.p  pIf I misprint some function name the expectation will simply fail because the code being tested is calling the correct one, so this is not a point... p  pFor emStubOutWithMockem if I wont notice some additional db function call in tested method, and wont stub it emStubOutWithMockem, it will call the real code and left some garbage in the db. So one more point to protect my solution  using the emCreateMockAnythingem instead of stubbing particular methods lets me to completely cut my db dependency, and I also will see the unexpected method call exception thrown by the MockAnything mock.p  pSo what are the reasons to avoid using of emCreateMockAnythingemp  pThanks,p

All loaded in a Sprite Sheet and using these blocks from this sprite sheet I create a shape. A level file is consist of these shapes. I load two levels at the same time one onscreen and another off screen to make it seamless scrolling.

Also if I play game very fast the peak of time increases  in track, that should be fine as I am giving more work to do, but once a peak is attained it remains approximately at that height only, even if I leave the game Idle. Is it normal  According to me it should have returned to its normal peak once the current work is done.p  p2 Some where I thought its happening because I used two batch nodes and removing its children on a user touch immediately might causing it slow but then after removing the children it should run normal. to give an idea is it ok to remove 10 children from batch node immediately  some guys say its very slow process. Just to check if this causing problem , I did p  pInstead of removing them I just set visibility of the children to false.But still FPS drops and never recovers.p  pPlease share your thoughts on this.p

When the user selects a option that does not have prefilled credentials they are prompted for a username and password. The credentials are appended to the appropriate list, the popup is destroyed and the log checking function is called.

Negative 70885 pSo I am working on a web project and everything looks good, we defined a bunch of visual elements and modularized them into separate scss files. So when building our pages, we just import the elements we wanna use and stitch them together.p  pThe problem is, different pages may use the same element but their layout may differ. The same button on one page may float left, while on another page it may float right. The same module on one page may have 30px margin top, while on another page it has 50px margin bottom.p  pWhat I thought is to have a secondary style sheet that contains some tiny amount of layout code for each page, and this file is page specific. Sure the client now has to download another asset but its just a few lines of css.p  pBut is this a bad idea How bad And if it is indeed evil, what will be a better approach to solve this problemp

Negative 70885 pWell, I have quite a delicate question  p  pLets start with what I havep  ol listrongDatastrong, large array of data, copied to GPUli listrongProgramstrong, generated by CPU host, which needs to be evaluated for every data in that arrayli liThe strongprogram changesstrong very frequently, can be generated as CUDA string, PTX string or something else  and strongneeds to be reevaluatedstrong after each changeli ol  pWhat I want Basically just want to make this as effective fast as possible, eg. avoid compilation of CUDA to PTX. Solution can be even completely devicespecific, no big compatibility is required here  p  pWhat I know I already know function strongcuLoadModulestrong, which can load and create kernel from PTX code stored in file. But I think, there must be some other way to create a kernel directly, without saving it to file first. Or perhaps it may be possible to store it as bytecodep  pMy question How would you do that Could you post an example or link to website with similar topic TYp  blockquote   pEdit OK now, PTX kernel can be a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15842507passingtheptxprogramtothecudadriverdirectlyrun from PTXa string char array directly. Anyways I still wonder, is there some better  faster solution to this There is still conversion from string to some PTX bytecode, which should be possibly avoided. I also suspect, that some clever way of creating device specific Cuda binary from PTX might exist, which would remove JIT compiler lag is small, but it can add up if you have huge numbers of kernels to run p blockquote

Negative 70885 pI am developing a live wallpaper using andengine. Initially i used about 20 texture atlas for each sprite but then in one of the posts in andengine forum I saw that to many texture atlas is not a good thing to have in your app so I changed it to texture packer and now i have 3 texture packers. Everything is ok except when the wallpaper gain focus either on unlock or closing another app, the wallpaper freezes for about 12 sec. Freezing was there even when i had individual texture atlas for each sprite. I added comments in onResume method and the first animation method to see what goes in between the execution of these two lines first and last line in the following logcat output and following is the logcat output. Can someone please direct me in right direction.

But from my point of view when you are going to have several clients, like mobile and web, not to duplicate code to work with database, it will be better to have one more level of abstraction, a WCF service, to perform all actions with a database and only receive requests and send responses to the clients. So my question is, will it be a good solution to havep  pdifferent clientsmobileweb  a WCF service  a database, or I am missing something in Azure get started tutorialsp  pBwt, talking about users authentication I am going to use Auth0, cause it provides a possibility to have a custom  OAuth authentications.p

Negative 70885 pAt this moment im working on a project to implement Sitecore 7.0 Update 2p  pIn my data template i have this field called Begin Date and another one End Date. These two fields are created with the type Date not Datetime. So it shows a datepicker when i edit and create items and ive filed some items with dummycontent and with Begin and End date from last month and the current month.p  pWhat i want to achieve is to get all the items within a selected month. My method contains a month and a year integer as parameter. This should control the items with the begin and end date it should get from the Lucene sitecoremasterindex.  The raw values of Sitecore for the Datefield are the ISO datetimestrings. p  pSo this is the query where i try to get all items from that selected month. p  precodeprivate void GetItemsint month, int year      using          IProviderSearchContext context                  ContentSearchManager. GetIndexsitecoremasterindex.CreateSearchContext               ListltEventSearchResultItemgt allEvents      context.GetQueryableltEventSearchResultItemgtnew     CultureExecutionContextSitecore.Context.Language.CultureInfo          .Wheres gt                 s.TemplateId  this.EventTemplateID ampamp                 s.BeginDate.Month  month ampamp s.BeginDate.Year  year  s.EndDate.Month  month ampamp s.EndDate.Year  year                              .ToList       codepre  pWith this Wherestatement i expect to return all items of the Eventstemplate somewhere that should contain a date within that month. But it returns an empty resultset. Downside is that i cant debug the Lambaexpression, so unfortunately i dont know the value in that scope. But not something between year 1 and 9999  After the IQueryable has executed the query and returned something, the objects in the list contains the correct DateTime for the properties. So it maps the fields from the index correctly to the properties. Also if i remove the datecheck so only the TemplateID check is the Whereclause, it returns results. But even comparing BeginDate to DateTime.MinValue and DateTime.MaxValue doenst return something.p  pIt uses the POCOclass EvenSearchResultItem which ive created for this. In this class ive mapped the field to the property and added the TypeConverter to convert it to DateTime. At least, it should...p  precodepublic class EventSearchResultItem  SearchResultItem      [TypeConvertertypeofIndexFieldDateTimeValueConverter]     [IndexFieldbegindate]     public DateTime BeginDate  get set       [TypeConvertertypeofIndexFieldDateTimeValueConverter]     [IndexFieldenddate]     public DateTime EndDate  get set   codepre  pAnd in the Sitecore.ContentSearch.Lucene.DefaultIndexConfiguration.config ive added the field within the tag also tried tag, but not that different in result.  Seep  precodeltfield luceneNamebegindate storageTypeyes indexTypetokenized formatyyyyMMddgtBegin Dateltfieldgt ltfield luceneNameenddate storageTypeyes indexTypetokenized formatyyyyMMddgtEnd Dateltfieldgt codepre  pSo in Luke the Javaapplication to view the contents of a Luceneindex after an reindex the field appears and contains the given date for that item in yyyyMMdd  20140214. Just like other datefields such as smallCreatedDate. p  pI can solve this by modifying my query top  precodeListltEventSearchResultItemgt allEvents  context.GetQueryableltEventSearchResultItemgt     .Wheres gt         s[Begin Date].StartsWithstring.Concatyear, month.ToString00  s[End Date].StartsWithstring.Concatyear, month.ToString00          .ToList codepre  pThis was a solution in another question here on Stack Overflow. But i dont consider that as best practice and reliable. Google didnt had any other alternatives unfortunately. I guess something as i imagine it would be possible rightp  pDoes anyone has experience filtering Luceneresults on DateTime from IQueryable And can point me in the right direction p

Negative 70885 pLua docs sayp  blockquote   pThe Lua library defines no global variables at all. It keeps all its state in the dynamic structure luaState and a pointer to this   structure is passed as an argument to all functions inside Lua. This   implementation makes Lua reentrant and ready to be used in   multithreaded code.p blockquote  pBut is it true Has anyone tried to verify this What if a signal is raised and caught by a custom handler during the execution of codeluacode That is, is codeluacode itself never mind the system calls it makes truly reentrantp  pEDITp  pA wellknown problem in codeluacode is the lack of a timer implementation. These can be implemented using codePOSIXcode timers, that raise a signal. But raising such a signal may interrupt the execution of codeluacode itself. The canonical solution to solve this problem is the maskingunmasking of a signal, but if codeluacode were truly reentrant this would not be needed.p

When we expose data from the Containerclass to others, we want to be able to expose just certain fields which are configurable at some other place might be sensitive data or whatnot. p  pThis we do with help of XmlAttributeOverrides to set XmlIgnore property for the exposed properties. This works well for most types of objects which does not have inheritance, but now we have the need to serialize different derived objects in different ways configurable. p  pSo in the above example, some customer has made the decision to exclude Property1 from class B and Property2 from class C, and as such I want the XML to look like above. This did not work with the above code though it seems like XmlSerializer uses the settings for the properties from the base class A, instead of using it from the respective derived classes B and C.p

Here is the code I have so farp  precodeimport flash.display.MovieClip import flash.events.MouseEvent import com.greensock. import com.greensock.easing.  function initvoid     TweenLite.toproductsmc, 1, x696, alpha1   init checkPositionR   function productsLefteventsMouseEventvoid      TweenLite.toproductsmc, .75, x255     arrowRbtn.visible  true     arrowRbtn.buttonMode  true     checkPositionL    function productsRighteventsMouseEventvoid      TweenLite.toproductsmc, .75, x255     arrowLbtn.visible  true     arrowLbtn.buttonMode  true     checkPositionR    function checkPositionRvoid  if productsmc.x  696      arrowRbtn.visible  false     arrowRbtn.buttonMode  false     function checkPositionLvoid  if productsmc.x  1086      arrowLbtn.visible  false     arrowLbtn.buttonMode  false    arrowLbtn.buttonMode  true arrowLbtn.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, productsLeft  arrowRbtn.buttonMode  true arrowRbtn.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, productsRight  arrowLbtn.doubleClickEnabled  true arrowRbtn.doubleClickEnabled  true   arrowLbtn.addEventListenerMouseEvent.DOUBLECLICK, doubleClickHandler, false  arrowRbtn.addEventListenerMouseEvent.DOUBLECLICK, doubleClickHandler, false   function doubleClickHandlerevtMouseEventvoid      evt.stopPropagation   codepre  pIf you remove the checkPositionR and checkPositionL functions from the productsRight and productsLeft functions, youll see this works ok, however then it ignores the toggle the button off. Basically this is just scrolling a movie clip left or right and I want it to not be able to scroll beyond a certain point in either direction. or loopsp  pAny ideas Thanksp  pyes I could do this on the timeline alot easier but I think this cool be as scriptedp

Negative 70885 pIm having a very odd bug with a CUDA v5.0 code. Basically, I am trying to use device memory to accumulate values for a program that needs to take the average of a bunch of pixels. In order to do this I have two kernels, one which accumulates a sum in floating point array, summask, and the other which does the division at the end, avgmask. The odd thing is that both kernels do exactly the operation I want them to do, multiplied by 14. I suspect it is somehow a synchronization or gridblock dim problem but I have checked and rechecked everything and cannot figure it out. Any help would be much appreciated.p  pEdit 1, Problem Statement Running a CUDA kernel that does any accumulation process gives me what I would expect if each pixel were run consecutively by 14 threads.

Negative 70885 pI am writing a collision detection system in as3. It is intended to be simple I have some moving rectangles and some static ones. When a moving rectangle collides with another rectangle, I would like to move the source colliding rectangle just outside of the collision area, but still as close as possible based on the sources trajectory.p  pOn every frame I update the positions of my moving rectangles and check for contact amongst all rectangles. p  pThe below image represents the followingp  pa Box 1 is moving at an angle of 45 degrees towards a static rectangle 2.p  pb After several ticks we see Rectangle 1 move into the space of Rectangle 2 the static one. This is the point at which impact is detected for the first time.p  pc Now  what I would really like to do  is move the source Rectangle 1 to the outskirts of Rectangle 2s collision area.p  p... So given the angle of movement of Rectangle 1 and, knowing the overall areas and positions of Rectangles 1 and 2, Is there a formula that provides the closest possible x and y coordinates for Rectangle 1 to be moved to so that we are no longer in full collision, as we see in stage b. p  pObviously I would like a solution that will work at any angle of movement and all sorts of rectangle shapes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGdBV6.png alt3 stepsp  pThanks in advance for your time on this p

Negative 70885 pIll get right into the subjectp  pI have a server that works a music recommendation system  for some kind of application the server has a very large databasep  pSo i made a singleton constructor of the recommendation system. My problem is  the first time this constructor is being created it has to run a training data and it connects to the database a lot which is a time consuming operationp  pThis has to run only the first time according to my singleton object and then afterwards, itll be able to use the results of the constructor right awayp  pMy problem is that on the first HTTP request from my PC to the server, the explorer times out and the singleton object is never created on the serverp  pI think my solution would be in extending the wait time of the explorer until the server finishes computation and returns with result, however  if someone has a better solution id be greatly in his dept p  pI really need an easy applicable solution that requires minimal effort because the delivery deadline is closing up and i need to wrap the project as fast as possiblep  pThanks againp

Negative 70885 pI have tried to find the answer but still didnt get the solution. p  pIn a binary tree auto spillage system. Say that member A has two legs, left and right both still empty. When a new member B comes to make registration, the system checks if the left legs of A is still empty and of course it is, the system then remember the left legs of A as an empty slot and will give it to B. B takes some minutes to complete the registration until it done. So far so good.p  pThe problem comes from here p  pDuring the completion of B registration. Other new member, C, make a registration as well. The system checks if the left legs of A is still empty and of course it is  because B not yet complete the query.p  pWhen registration of B has done, the left leg of A is fill by B. But when C has done, C overwrite the B. p  pWhat should I do to solve this problem p

Its about how renderer draw points if there are so many of them.p  pI am making graph control with children figures. They have to render themselves and Id expect they only need context, but if figure is too big, how should I implement clipping It is logical, I can check bounds, but question is emwhich boundsem Of graph control And what if codeClipToBoundsfalsecode and figure emshouldem go out of bounds This is what I want to know.p  pFor performance reasons using standard wpf figures is not optimal thousands of points, hundreds of different enclosed areas with different filling, etc..p  hr  pGraph is FrameworkElement without content. And graph content may be propelled correct word into parent area. Question is how to get bounds to optimize figure rendering, so they dont call Draw methods of codeDrawingContextcode if coordinates are out of bounds Imagine 1000000 items to go through for a single render, while knowing bounds may cause skipping some of them.p

Negative 70885 pI am trying to use Python to geocode a list of addresses I have stored in a table in PostGIS. I would like to set things up so that every time the table is updated, and a new address is added, it would automatically be geocoded and then plotted on a map. The only way I could think to do so was to use plpythonu to create a geocoding function, and then some combination of update and trigger to get what I wanted. However, plpythonu is acting really weird I might ask about that here later, but for now I am looking for alternative solutions rather than figuring out plpythonu .p  pI cant think of another way to set things up so an entry is geocoded as soon as it is entered into the database Can someone give me some ideas on where to start lookingp

Negative 70885 pSo I have been working with Saxon quite a bit recently and am having some concerns about its memory management ability. p  pFrom what I understand Saxon does not take data as streams which means that if I need to make comparisons on 1000 tuples all 1000 tuples are allocated memory. This seems like a flawed system to me. Is there a reason behind this other than limitations in javap  pI feel like this really makes XQuery a less viable alternative to SQL and JDBC which supports streaming. p

The memory usage drops by a small inconsistent amount 520 MB, but the rest of it doesnt get freed until the app is resumed.p  pIs this a quirk with the debugger and the memory emisem being freed Or does the garbage collector not have enough time to clean up before the app is suspended Or am I doing this all wrongp  pstrongUpdatestrong Im pretty sure its related to SpriteKit automatically pausing the SKView when entering the background.

Negative 70885 pI am interested in setting new methods for generic functions.  For example, lets say I have a new class e.g. codecoolClasscode.

Negative 70885 pSo, Im basically wondering if for a matrix A of the typep  p0 ap  pb 0p  pthere is an easy way to calculate eAt, since if it were p  p0 bp  pb 0p  pOne would just have the rotation matrix where the angular frequency of the terms would be b, with the sines and cosines. Because going through the hassle of getting the Jordan Block and Change of Basis seems to be too much work for such a simple one. Then again,I might be wrongp  pAs an exemple, say A  p  p0 9 1 0p  pWhere the eigenvalues are 3i. How would I proceedp

Negative 70885 pSo I know a similar question has been asked in regards to this error. I know its because theres something wrong with the code which is why its not compiling. My problem is that I dont know where exactly in my code the error is and I cant figure it out. Just to sum up the program, its an XML parser that creates a TreeNode data structure and exports it into excel. Before I added the feature of it exporting to excel, it was working perfectly fine. But when I used apache poi to export it to excel for some reason theres been compilation problems, but I cant see how that might be where the error is being caused. Can anyone spot whatwhere in the code this problem is occuring Cheersp  pEdit apologies This is the error Exception in thread main java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem  at HMDB.XML.mainXML.java200p  pIts strange because the line of coding it seems to occur at is a blank line.

Negative 70885 pI am working on a small linux socket project. The goal is to have multiple servers ie. 1,2,3,4,5 that listen for codesendcode codegetcode and codeACKcode packets from each of their respective clients. I am currently attempting to implement a routing table protocol whereby 2 servers A, B exchange their routing tables vectors containing respective clients, server name, and number of hops. The issue I am having is with binding a socket to Bs external address from A and viceversa. From what I have read you do not bind to anything other than a local address except in certain cases. What I am wondering is how do I simply fire off a UDP packet from one server to another knowing the static IP address of each serverp

Negative 70885 pSo this code is meant to serve as a simple search system to go to certain records in a recordset. I originally had it so they had to click the btnGoToID button in order to perform the search.  I decided to just make it a little more user friendly and make it so the search field listened for the Enter button and that would perform the search as well.  p  pThe issue that I am running into when the code gets to codestrID  TrimNzMe.txtSearch.Value, code the value will randomly come back as an empty string even though visually I can see that there is a value in the textbox.  p  pI havent been able to narrow down any pattern for when this issue occurs.  At this point I dont really even know how to troubleshoot this problem, nor the words to search for that could yield any results in Google.  All I can say is that it SEEMS like changing between records will affect whether or not the search goes through.  p  pThis has always worked up until I put in the txtSearchKeyPress sub procedure. p  precode  txtSearchKeyPress  Private Sub txtSearchKeyPressKeyAscii As Integer     If user pressed enter     If KeyAscii  13 Then         Call btnGoToIDClick     End If End Sub      btnGoToIDClick   ltltPurposegtgt  Allow the user to search for a specific ID   Private Sub btnGoToIDClick On Error GoTo ErrHandler      Dim rs As Recordset     Dim strID As String      Set rs  Me.RecordsetClone      strID  TrimNzMe.txtSearch.Value,       If strID ltgt  Then          Go to the ID         rs.FindFirst ID   amp strID amp           If rs.NoMatch Then             MsgBox ID does not exist         Else              If we have a match, set the record as the current record             Me.Bookmark  rs.Bookmark         End If     Else         MsgBox Please enter a valid ID., vbOKOnly, Invalid ID     End If   ExitHandler On Error Resume Next      Me.txtSearch.Value       rs.Close     Set rs  Nothing     Exit Sub  ErrHandler     Call LogErrorErr.Number, Err.Description, txtSearch on  amp Me.Name     Resume ExitHandler End Sub codepre  pAfter the conversation in the comments I have narrowed down this question to be a whole lot simpler.  This yields an Invalid use of null error message even after there are several characters in the text field.  Why would that happen, and what can I do to make it pick up the values in the textbox p  precode  txtUnitNoToSearchKeyPress  Private Sub txtUnitNoToSearchKeyPressKeyAscii As Integer     MsgBox Me.txtUnitNoToSearch End Sub codepre

Negative 70885 pI have a bit of a logical challenge. I have a single table in excel that contains an identifier column and a cross reference column. There can be multiple rows for a single identifier which indicates multiple cross references. see basic example belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6BEw1.png altenter image description herep  pAny record that ends in the letter X indicates that it is a cross reference, and not an actual identifier. I need to generate a list of the cross references for each identifier, but trace it down to the actual cross reference identifier. So using A1 as an example from the table above, I would need the list returned as follows A2,A3,B1,B3. Notice there are no identifiers ending in X in the list, they have been traced down to the actual source record through the table. p  pAny ideas or help would be much appreciated. Im using python and xlrd to read the table.p

Negative 70885 pI dont get it I have two foreign keys identically set and two codebelongsTocode functions but one of them doesnt work right, instead of returning an array it just returns a string value from database.p  pHere are the tables that I have in database.p  pTable pagesp  precode  id  author       title      content    status    1     1     page one title  page text     1      2     1     page one title  page text     2     codepre  pTable usersp  precode  id  username       email           role    1     darth   darthdeathstar.dot    1    codepre  pTable pagestatusesp  precode  id     name    value    1   Published    1      2     Draft      2      3    Review      3     codepre  pSo the author and status fields from pages table are foreign keys of tables users and table pagestatuses. p  pBoth fields, author and status from pages are integers and unsigned, and also indexes. When i check  relations in codephpmyadmincode I get this on pages tablep  precode  Column     Foreign key constraint INNODB          Keyname             author        laravell.users.id         pagesauthorforeign      status  laravell.pagestatuses.value  pagesstatusforeign       codepre  pWhen I input some data in database on my pages table in author and status fields i can click on numbers and it will lead me to proper data in codephpmyadmincode. For example if I click on author number it will redirect me to users table and show the row of that author, so that works.p  pAnd now i have set the models p  precodemodels    Page.php    PageStatus.php    User.php codepre  pAnd finally i need to set relations. Under Page.php i have p  precodepublic function author      return thisgtbelongsToUser, author, id   public function pagestatus      return thisgtbelongsToPageStatus, status, value  codepre  pSo everything is set right and everything should be working but something is not. p  pWhen I die amp dump the author returns just a string while codepagestatuscode returns and array of that row. The output is p  precode  author                 status                   1    id2,nameDraft,value2   codepre  pSo the status returns correct and author doesnt returns correct.p

Negative 70885 pI have a dictionary file that contains a list of words, and I read that file into the array list codesArraycode. I then have a book where I use a string parser to take every string from this book and send it to the binary search method, codebSearchcode. codebSearchcode will use a recursive binary search to determine if key is found in the array codesArraycode containing the dictionary. If the word is not found it will print out that the word is possibly misspelled. p  pMy issue is, I am getting outputs of words that I know for a fact are in my dictionary array.

Negative 70885 pIm writing a C library for optimization, and Ive encountered a curious issue with contravariant types.p  pSo, I define a hierarchy of functions, based on what information they can compute.p  precodeclass Function   public     double value0   class DifferentiableFunction  public Function   public   const double gradient0   class TwiceDifferentiableFunction  public DifferentiableFunction   public     const double hessian0  codepre  pWhich is all well and good, but now I want to define interfaces for the optimizers.  For example, some optimizers require gradient information, or hessian information in order to optimize, and some dont.  So the types of the optimizers are contravariant to the types of the functions.p  precodeclass HessianOptimizer   public     setfunctionTwiceDifferentiableFunction f0   class GradientOptimizer  public HessianOptimizer   public     setfunctionDifferentiableFunction f0   class Optimizer public GradientOptimizer   public     setfunctionTwiceDifferentiableFunction f0  codepre  pWhich I suppose makes sense from a type theoretic perspective, but the thing that is weird about it is that usually when people want to extend code, they will inherit the already existing classes.  So for example, if someone else was using this library, and they wanted to create a new type of optimizer that requires more information than the hessian, they might create a class likep  precodeclass ThriceDifferentiableFunction public TwiceDifferentiableFunction   public     const double thirdderivative0  codepre  pBut then to create the corresponding optimizer class, we would have to make HessianOptimizer extend ThirdOrderOptimizer.  But the library user would have to modify the library to do so  So while we can add on the ThriceDifferentiableFunction without having to modify the library, it seems like the contravariant types lose this property.  This seems to just be an artifact of the fact the classes declare their parent types rather than their children types.  p  pBut how are you supposed to deal with this Is there any way to do it nicelyp
Negative 70885 pThe problem is pretty straight foward. When using the basic initialization of datatables server processing only plain text is displayed on the page. Rather, it pulls EXACTLY what is in the database columns into the table columns with no additional HTML formatting. p  pExample Here is an img of what HTML and CSS formatted text looks like  a hrefhttpi.imgur.comli2UMI7.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comli2UMI7.pnga. Each column of the table has its own stylingformat. Now when datatables server processing makes a request to the serverdatabase the results are, like I said, exactly as they are in the database.

Negative 70885 pSo, I dont have much experience with Parse. But, Ive been reading through the documentation and its giving me some guidance, but I still cant figure out how to get data from an Array data field.p  pI have an Array data field called Collection and it looks something like thisp  blockquote   p[170 grams tomato puree,118 milliliters water,74 milliliters   olive oil,2 cloves garlic,12 tablespoon dried oregano,12   teaspoon dried basil,12 teaspoon dried rosemary,salt,freshly   grounded pepper]p blockquote  pI also have a RecipeId field which looks something like thisp  blockquote   pJE9sVV84Lkp blockquote  pOf which references to a unique field in a Recipe table. The Ingredients table all has unique fields. There is no way in which a piece of data will be entered which is a replica. This is done through validation. So at the very most, and at the very least, only one item will ever be returned because It will never be able to find another Object which is mapped against the same RecipeId. It just wont ever happen. p  pThe code looks like thisp  precodeprotected void doInBackgroundVoid... params  ingredients  new ArrayListltgt  try     ParseQueryltParseObjectgt query  new ParseQueryltgtIngredients    query.whereEqualToRecipeId, JE9sVV84Lk     parseList  query.find    forParseObject object  parseList      ListltStringgt ing  object.getListContainer     forString s  ing      Ingredient temp  new Ingredient     temp.setIngredientDatas      ingredients.addtemp     codepre  p p  pIf anybody can help, I would be greatly appreciable.

Negative 70885 pI have a simple library application, and one thing it needs to accomplish is checkoutreturn books. In that checkoutreturn window, I have two tables, a Book List table, which starts full of books I already have stored, and a CheckoutReturn table, which starts out empty. The CheckoutReturn table is populated by double clicking items in the Book List table, and then depopulated by double clicking items displayed within itself. Double clicking adds or removes the book items tofrom a checkoutreturn ArrayList which is then displayed in the table.p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to filter out books in the Book List table by the contents of the CheckoutReturn ArrayList. Unable to post images of desired effect at this time.p  pIs this even possible, and if so, how similar is this to filtering by the contents of a JTextFieldp  pEdit Ive since found this approach a hrefhttppulkitsinghal.blogspot.com201006multiplerowfiltersforjtable.html relnofollowhttppulkitsinghal.blogspot.com201006multiplerowfiltersforjtable.htmla.p  precodeRowFilterltTableModel, Objectgt firstFiler  null RowFilterltTableModel, Objectgt secondFilter  null ListltRowFilterltTableModel,Objectgtgt filters  new ArrayListltRowFilterltTableModel,Objectgtgt RowFilterltTableModel, Objectgt compoundRowFilter  null try      firstFiler  RowFilter.regexFilteryourRegexString, columnIndex     secondFilter  RowFilter.regexFilteryourRegexString, columnIndex     filters.addfirstFiler     filters.addsecondFilter     compoundRowFilter  RowFilter.andFilterfilters  you may also choose the OR filter  catch java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException e      return  sorter.setRowFiltercompoundRowFilter codepre  pHowever, this achieves the opposite affect I want.

Franja is time slot, Docente is the teacher and Salon is the Room. FranjaDocente represents those time slots when the teacher is available, and in the same way, FranjaSalon represents those time slots when the room are available. EspacioAcademico represents an assignment, for example Jhon Doe at 600 a.m. 800 a.m. on the room A with linear Progamming. The records on EspacioAcademico are created by an algorithm, and due to the data, maybe have a partially assignment time slot null, teacher null or room null. On oracle database, in table EspacioAcademico, i have a composite foreign key to franjaDocentes primary key and franjaSalons primary key, an it allow null values on franja, docente or salon column in EspacioAcademico Table. In FranjaDocente or FranjaSalon this is not allowed.

Negative 70885 pI am trying to embed a youtube video on the background of my website.

Negative 70885 pI am still very new to Magento, fortunately I know enough to explain the scenario but not yet clear on exactly where to look for these processes.  I hope this can be an instructional thread.p  pMy company uses the onepage checkout system, with 5 steps registr. type [guest or register], billing, shipping, payment method, and review.  At the point of billing info, the user has option to select credit card or paypal.p  pIf the user selects credit card, the entries into codesalesflatordercode and codesalesflatorderitemcode are populated correctly from the shipping and billing information in the user forms.  However, if they select paypal, the user is redirected to paypal, and after payment is received sent back to our site.  However, all of the billing and shipping information from steps 2 and 3 is discarded and the system enters the data from paypal, with shipping information being null.p  pThe question is really in two parts 1. what class and method is the entry into codesalesflatordercode and code..flatcode happening in, i.e. where may I find it and 2. lets presume user gets back to our cart from paypal and that the session can be retrieved.  I can guarantee that through a token passed in the return URL if I need to. Then, where can I access the data that was previously submitted in form steps 1,2, and 3p  pBasically I need to intercept the process that happens after the return from paypal, or when the order is entered on our end.  Thanksp

Negative 70885 pIn my app codeminSdkVersioncode 15 I have a codeToolbarcode instead of codeActionBarcode and codeNavigationDrawercode switching between fragments. Some fragments have codeTabBarcode with child fragments inside. These child fragments are codeListViewcodes, and their codeonItemClickListenercode triggers codeDetailFragmentcode. I call codesetDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledcode and an up arrow appears for codeDetailFragmentcode but I cant treat it to perform any action, or even show a toast.

First, I could figure out who manages the up button whenp  precodeactionBarDrawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabledfalse codepre  pandp  precodegetSupportActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue codepre  por otherwise, how can I override the codeActionBarDrawerTogglecode behavior to perform another action when the up button arrow is available instead of the hamburger icon And how to cause the hamburger icon to appear when I press the hardware back buttonp

Negative 70885 pI came across this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22597945timecomplexityofdynamicarraysarticlea regarding time complexity of dynamic arrays which clarified a lot. However I have a case based question. Say I have a dynamic array that has a total of 6 elements and suppose the 4th element is removed. In this case the deletion complexity would be codeOnindexcode which will be codeO64  2code since the last two elements will only need to move up. Is this correct  I have articles that give the worst case complexity saying that if the top most element is removed then time complexity would be codeOncode.

A screenshot is provied as followingp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comttBU1.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comttBU1.jpg altGoogle Map push notificationap  pThis is quite amazing to me as an iOS developer. How can it live in the background and detect I am entering a car with such accuracyp  pOne of my guess is, Google map is using significant location change API. By using this way, the app can be waken in background mode, but, there is still no guarantee it is waken when I am entering my car. And I have already written a test app using this mechanism, although it can be waken in the background, but the timing is not correct, failed to detect I am entering a car or not.p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCoreLocationReferenceCLLocationManagerClassapplerefoccinstmCLLocationManagerstartMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges relnofollowCLLocationManager Class Referenceap  blockquote   pIf you start this service and your app is subsequently terminated, the system automatically relaunches the app into the background if a new event arrives. In such a case, the options dictionary passed to the applicationwillFinishLaunchingWithOptions and applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions methods of your app delegate contains the key UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocationKey to indicate that your app was launched because of a location event. Upon relaunch, you must still configure a location manager object and call this method to continue receiving location events. When you restart location services, the current event is delivered to your delegate immediately. In addition, the location property of your location manager object is populated with the most recent location object even before you start location services.p blockquote  pAny suggestion and help appreciated.p

Negative 70885 pthank you in advance for viewing my question. Im a high school student going to be pursuing computer science next year in college. Currently Im interning at a very large scale software development company. My job title is Application Developer, but basically Im just doing a ton of backend web development. Im using java for server side and javascript for client side. Im doing a lot of HTTP Programming using REST APIs. I have a good understanding of java, but not so much javascript. Ive tried javascript on code academy, but thought it wasnt producing much. So my question is, does anyone know good resourcesbooks on learning javascriptjava web developmentREST ApisHTTP programming Ill appreciate every response. Also, I have an understanding on how htmlcss works...Im just awful at designing the look of websites, if I wanted to create a website portfolio, would be making one through like wordpress be acceptablep  pThank you again.p
