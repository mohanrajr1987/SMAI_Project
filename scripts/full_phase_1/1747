Positive 1747 pI have a folder with assemblies that all contain an implementation of a certain interface different in each assembly. I have written some unit tests for that interface, and would like to automate the task of running the interface tests on each implementation.p  pI have a working solution that I dont likep  ul lipWrite code in the actual test class to load the assemblies and instantiate the implementations, store these in a list.pli lipWrite each test to loop through the list of implementations, running its assertions on each.pli ul  pemWhat I want insteadem is to run all tests on one implementation, then move on to the next to run all tests again, and so on. My thought was to find a way to do something like programmaticallyp  ul liLoad the assemblies and instantiate the implementations  like before, but not inside the test class.li liCreate an instance of the test class, injecting the next implementation.li liRun the tests.li liMove on to the next implementation, repeating the process.li ul  pI realize that I could be shuffling files around in the file system  like put an assembly in one location  run the test which loads emoneem implementation  replace the assembly with the next implementation, and then repeat the process. However, I would like something less crude, if possible.p  pIve been looking at the nUnit testrunners console etc. for a short cut, but found none so far. Does anyone know if there is a way to achieve what I want using nUnit or any other test suite that can be controlled programmatically Or maybe theres another way to go about it all, that will satisfy the what I want criteria abovep
Positive 1747 pWe currently are using TeamCity as our build server for performing scheduled nightly builds 0730 amp 1830 using an MSBUILD file we wrote and also running a suite of NUNIT integration tests.p  pThe company is moving over to TFS 2013 we use VS2013 PROFESSIONAL shortly and i was asked if it is possible to import all these projects over to TFS and have it running in the exactly the same fashion as TeamCity has it configured.

Positive 1747 pI have several test assemblies with multiple test fixtures in them testing client server scenarios.p  pRunnig tests wit the real server is very time consuming and difficult to debug. Thats why I developed server fake, so tests can run against fake server.p  pThe same test should also pass with the real server. This tests must run on regular basis in a dedicated environment, but a developer must also have a possibility to start them explicitly.p  pThe solution I found isp  precodepublic interface IHaveServer      IServer GetServer   public abstract class AbstractTests  IHaveServer      [Test]     public void TestX              var server  GetServer         var actual  server.Call         Assert.AreEqualHello, actual           public abstract IServer GetServer   [TestFixture] [Explicit] public class TestsWithRealServer  AbstractTests      public override IServer GetServer              return new RealServer        [TestFixture] public class TestsWithFakeServer  AbstractTests      public override IServer GetServer              return new FakeServer       codepre  pI dont like it because in this case every developer must think about splitting his test fixture into two. They are also not automatically grouped so that you can run only all fakes or only reals.p  pIs it a way to do that automatically I was thinking about NUnit extensibility a hrefhttpwww.nunit.orgindex.phppsuiteBuildersampr2.6.4 relnofollowISuiteBuildera. p  pstrongSo the ultimate goal isstrong that, developers just write their tests, creating as many fixtures as needed. When you start a test runner two sets of test show up one against fake one against real server. You can choose to run one of these sets or both.p  pTechnologies used code.NETcode, codeccode, codeNUnitcode, codeNinjectcode, codemoqcodep

Positive 1747 pIm testing a component that somehow reacts to a delegate it receives. Specifically Im testing that a certain behavior is triggered when the passed delegate throws an exception.p  pSince its a test, the life expectancy of the thread is very short. I thought about using AutoResetEvent to signal the main thread when the delegate is completed, but if I invoke Set before throwing the exception, I end up in a race condition that does not allow the test to be fully repeatable. A solution I tried is to invoke the Set in a finally block, so that the code is executed regardless of the exception being thrown. But I still have the same problem with the Mock.Verify failing.p  pRight now I use Task.Delay to synchronize the threads, but I know I can do it without blocking the thread for 2 painful seconds.p  pHere is the code of the test.p  precode[Test] public async Task TCommandErroryStrategyisinvokedwhenhandlerthrows      AutoResetEvent are  new AutoResetEventfalse      options.ServiceBusFactory  new LoopbackServiceBusFactory      var sut  CreateSystemUnderTest      var exception  Mock.OfltExceptiongt      sut.SubscribeToCommandltTestCommandgtmsg gt              try                      throw exception                  finally                      are.Set                    var message  fixture.CreateltCommandMessageltTestCommandgtgt      mockContextManager.Setupp gt p.CreateCommandMessageIt.IsAnyltIConsumeContextltTestCommandgtgt.Returnsmessage      await sut.Start      await sut.SendCommandmessage      are.WaitOneTimeSpan.FromSeconds3      await Task.DelayTimeSpan.FromSeconds2      mockCommandErrorStrategy.Verifyp gt p.HandleErrorIt.IsAnyltIConsumeContextltTestCommandgtgt, exception, Times.AtLeastOnce  codepre
Positive 1747 pIm using NUnit 3.0 and TestFixtureSource to run test cases inside a fixture multiple times with different parametersconfigurations I do want to do this at TestFixture level. Simple examplep  precode[TestFixtureSourcetypeof ConfigurationProvider] public class Fixture      public FixtureConfiguration configuration              configuration  configuration           private Configuration configuration      [Test]     public void Test              do something with configuration         Assert.Fail       codepre  pLets say Test fails for one of the configurations and succeeds for another. In the run report file and in Visual Studios Test Explorer the name for both the failed and the succeeded runs will be displayed as just Test, which doesnt tell me anything about which setup caused issues. p  pstrongIs there a way to affect the test cases names in this situation i.e. prefix its name per fixture runconfigurationstrong As a workaround Im currently printing to the results output before each test case fires but I would rather avoid doing that. p  pSince NUnit 3.0 is in beta and this feature is fairly new I wasnt able to find anything in the docs. I found TestCaseData but I dont think its tailored to be used with fixtures just yet its designed for test cases.p
Positive 1747 pIve a project where Im reading a excel file for the test cases.The code for reading the excel and mapping the cases to C classes is being done like thisp  precodeclass AllTests  public static IEnumerable DemoCases                      get                           Read the excel map the cases here              yield return testcasedataObject                            codepre  pAnd the test method looks like this  p  precode [Test, TestCaseSourcetypeofAllTests, DemoCases]         public void DemoTest                     Test execution code          codepre  pNow all this works fine with Nunit 2.6.4, but with the beta the excel is not being read while discovering test cases. I need to use the TestFixtureSource of the beta alongwith the TestCaseSource. p
Positive 1747 pIve started trying to use the Test Explorer with the nunit test adapter. The unit tests that Im running have some test files which are loaded from a test folder, the test folder contains test files which are specific to a particular project. Running nunit manually previously, I was able to specify the working directory for the test, but I cant see how I would do that when using the test explorer. So currently I have some unit tests failing because theyre unable to find these test files.p  pIve tried using the project macro to define in the code where the test files will reside in relation to the project directory but thats given me more issues. Ive tried setting the Project ProjectDir macro as a Preprocessor definition as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14888402accessingvisualstudiomacrosfromsourcecodeaccessingvisualstudiomacrosfromsourcecodea, however Im using the compiler from visual studio 2008, so I either get codeWarning   21  warning C4129   unrecognized character escape sequence fromcodePROJECTDIRECTORYProjectDircodebecause the backslashes in the directory structure from ProjectDir or by doing PROJECTDIRECTORYLRProjectDir I getcodeC2065 LR  undeclared identifier because LR doesnt exist in C prior to C11.p

Positive 1747 pIm trying to learn how to properly use Unit Testing for a WebApi2 project.  In my past projects, I frequently have used DataAnnotations for basic Model validation. However, they dont seem to be triggered properly in my Unit Tests.p  pIn the below example, the actual API controller when hit with a real HTTP request, behaves properly. It will return a BadRequest 400 when I submit a JSON object without ParrotTalk defined.  However, the TestMethod doesnt seem to invoke this rule.  What can I do to have this reflected in my Unit Test without resorting to convaluted methods  This seems like something that should work out of the box as they are built in, and commonly used features in MVC.p  pThis is my model passed up the wire in JSON.p  precode public class ParrotModel      [Required]     public string ParrotTalk  get set   codepre  pThis is the actual method in the controller.p  precode    [HttpPost]     [Routeanotherendpoint]     public IHttpActionResult CallParrotFromBodyParrotModel Parrot              if ModelState.IsValid                      return BadRequest                  return Oknew TestModel  SomeString  Bawwwwwk   Parrot.ParrotTalk       codepre  pThis is my TestMethod.  For some reason, when this runs, ModelState.IsValid is true...but its not when running in a real sitep  precode    [TestMethod]     public void CallParrotFromBody              good request         var controller  new RichController          var result  controller.CallParrotFromBodynew ParrotModel  ParrotTalk  Stuff          OkNegotiatedContentResultltTestModelgt okResult  result as OkNegotiatedContentResultltTestModelgt          Assert.IsNotNullokResult         Assert.IsInstanceOfTypeokResult.Content, typeofTestModel         Assert.AreEqualokResult.Content.SomeString, Bawwwwwk   Stuff           bad requestWHY DOESNT THIS WORK         var nullRequestController  new RichController         var nullRequestResult  nullRequestController.CallParrotFromBodynew ParrotModel           BadRequestResult badResult  nullRequestResult as BadRequestResult          Assert.IsNotNullbadResult      codepre  pIn the image below, you can clearly see that the IsValid portion of the code is not triggered because the [Required] attribute wasnt processed.

Ideally I would like it to create standalone executable that I will be able to run on a bare installed system, with no need to install some additional testing software.

Negative 1747 pUsing SQL Server 2005, I have a table where certain events are being logged, and I need to create a query that returns only very specific results.

And to clarify on this, the correct result would look like thisp  pre LogID  FBID    Date     LogName  LogType     6      4    2007116    John     Critical    2      3    2007111    Ben      Critical pre  pIts not the first date per FBID Im after, but the row where the LogName is changed from the original.p  pOriginally FBID 4 belongs to Mike, but the query should return the row where it moves on to John. However, it should NOT return the row where it moves further on to Nina, because the first responsibility change already happened when John got it.p  pIn the case of Ben with FBID 3, the logger is never changed, so the first row for Ben should be returned.p

Negative 1747 pI have a bunch of .NET Webservices running in one IIS Application. These webservices are consumed by another IIS Application frontend. The first call is pretty slow, about 5 to 10 seconds. After that its just milliseconds. The first call is considered a performance problem.p  pWeve tried an application that calls all these webservices but this obviously doesnt solve anything. So its not the default Application Recycle that is the problem. Ive created an application that just initializes the service several times and measures the time it takes to create one instance. Before running this application I ensure that my webservice application is started  recycled, then I run the application. The first initialization takes between 2 to 4 seconds, all others is just milliseconds.p  pAnother thought is that we create a page in the Frontend application that initiates all the webservices and that we call this page before any users are in. I dont consider this as an elegant solution, what else could I try p
Negative 1747 pSuppose you have a set of nodes. Some nodes are producers, some are consumers, and some are routers. Each node has a maximum throughput which defines the maximum number of units it can accept per day, and also the maximum number of units it can send per day in this case accepts and sends do not interfere with each other. Each node also has a storage capacity for units, allowing them to deal with variations in flow. Also, each node may only be outconnected with up to 8 nearby nodes on a plane, and the same limit applies to inconnections.p  pI already have a heuristic which, given a graph, enumerates the nodes and does a goodenough job pushing units to following nodes. It enumerates each node, sending maxceilremainingsendableunitsremainingfollowingnodes, remainingreceivableunitsatreceiver to each target node.p  pNow I need a way to automatically look at a node, and decide what the graph topology should be in order for goodenough flow. My basic idea was to assign a responsibility to each node, initially equivalent to how many units they consumed. Then adding an edge from n1 to n2 would give some of n2s responsibility to n1. But I quickly found that the difference between the amount a node could consume and the amount a node could accept confused the algorithm and led me in circles.p  pemeditem The amount consumed by each producerconsumer can vary over time below some maximum and nodes can be added or removed.p  pAny simple ideasp

Negative 1747 pIs there a way to stop the inferior without using CtrlC or an equivalent signal sent from another process  Im using a windows platform and am managing GDB from another process, so with no notion of signals, it seems that there isnt a good way to break execution of my program when its free running without any breakpoints.p  pstrongEDIT FOR CLARITYstrongp  pThere are 2 processes involved here.  Theres process A, which is the parent of GDB.  GDB is managing a process, but its on a remote host, and well call that process C.  p  pWhen I tell GDB to run it kicks off process C on the remote host and blocks either until a breakpoint is hit, process C encounters an error or a fatal signal, or GDB itself receives an interrupt signal.  If working interactively, you would simply press CTRLC at the GDB command console, which GDB interprets as a SIGINT somehow, triggering GDB to halt process C.  Since Im actually managing GDB with process A and not dealing with it interactively at the shell  I cant very well press CtrlC, and since windows has no native notion of Signals like you have in UNIX, I cant figure out how to interrupt GDB when its blocking waiting for process C to interrupt or hit a breakpoint.p

I think anyway. p  pnormal request  ContentType applicationjson charsetutf8 SIM proxy request  ContentType textxml charsetutf8p  pissue number one with this is the request requires a verb in the web.config enabling GETPOST easy addedp  pissue number two with this, the GET request is built like so emwww.site.coma.asmxfunctionvaluea valueem the JSON serialiser understand this is a string type so it removes the appended quotation marks and accepts the parameter, when the serialiser isnt used it will actually add more quotation marks a value. Easy fixedp  pIssue number three the return value is XML and not JSON. Requires allot of work but can be fixed should i not be able to find another way.p  pIve just been reading the W3 for the HTTP header CacheControl and apparently I can send notransform and assuming they conform the proxy will ignore it. That would be fantastic. p  pQuestion is... How do I change the header value of a GET request via Sys.Net.WebServiceProxy.invokep  pAlso has any one any experience with this the internet reveals little discussion on the topic. p  pMany Thanks in advance of any responses and sorry for the wall of text for a one line question... just fingers crossed someone has encountered this before.p

Negative 1747 pI have a relatively complex query, with several self joins, which works on a rather large table. For that query to perform faster, I thus need to only work with a subset of the data. Said subset of data can range between 12 000 and 120 000 rows depending on the parameters passed.p  pMore details can be found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3054843sqlserverctereferredinselfjoinsslowhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3054843sqlserverctereferredinselfjoinsslowap  pAs you can see, I was using a CTE to return the data subset before, which caused some performance problems as SQL Server was rerunning the Select statement in the CTE for every join instead of simply being run once and reusing its data set.p  pThe alternative, using temporary tables worked much faster while testing the query in a separate window outside the UDF body. However, when I tried to implement this in a multistatement UDF, I was harshly reminded by SQL Server that multistatement UDFs do not support temporary tables for some reason...p  pUDFs do allow table variables however, so I tried that, but the performance is absolutely horrible as it takes 1m40 for my query to complete whereas the CTE version emonlyem took 40 seconds. I believe the table variables is slow for reasons listed in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1643687tablevariablepoorperformanceoninsertinsqlserverstoredprocedurehttpstackoverflow.comquestions1643687tablevariablepoorperformanceoninsertinsqlserverstoredprocedureap  pTemporary table version takes around 1 seconds, but I cant make it into a function due to the SQL Server restrictions, and I emhaveem to return a table back to the caller.p  pConsidering that CTE and table variables are both too slow, and that temporary tables are rejected in UDFs, What are my options in order for my UDF to perform quicklyp  pThanks a lot in advance.p

Negative 1747 pIm looking for a tool that will determine the likelihood that a given codebase was plagiarized off a certain original codebase.

That is unacceptable.p  pThere is also one exceptionp  blockquote   prunOnce aborts waiting for a   connection request and returns   immediately if the process receives a   signal. Note that unless you have a   handler for that signal, the signal   will probably kill the whole process,   so set up a signal handler  even one   that does nothing  if you want to   exploit this.

So this is why I am doing the add in, and not some automatic storing of emails  noise after some time.p  pThis said, how to store the emails For the emails that I recieve or send through Outlook the idea could be save the whole file in a blob field so the eml file, may be I can save also other info like the subject in another text field. But the problem comes when I write an email from my application.p  pIn this case I am not generating an eml file, I send through MAPI data to Outlook to compose an email that I will send with Outlook so in this case I cannot save the eml, or I directly send it with Indy. Also in this case I dont have the eml file...p  pOne idea could be that the all the emails that I auto compose have a special flag that the Add in recognises and therefore when I send the mail it is stored back to the DB. So in this case I can save the eml also of the mails I sent from my application.p  pMay you commentp

The Results dont have to be just as above, but similar if possible.p  pIm quite good with simple Regex but I cant get my head around lookarounds etc. The Name  Value sets can repeat numerous possibly, but unlikely unlimited times each separated by a , comma  except for the last set the last namevalue set will not be followed by a , comma. There can be spaces either side of the  equals sign or not as well as either side of the , comma.p  pI dont know if this is too complicated to do with Regex or what if it is Im open to any suggestions anyone can give as an alternative on how to parse such a string.p  pThanks for any help anyone can provide.p  pChrisp

Negative 1747 pI have a table with observations x, y and need to estimate the mean of the Poisson distribution that more closely resembles them. It seems R and Octave can both do this on Linux, but I was wondering if there is a multiplatform way to do it. I can bundle anything with the program but I cant ask to install anything for it to run.p  pI tried searching for an algorithm to do it myself and couldnt find one, so I dont know what to do.p  pFor the record, I did find a simple algorithm to do it that was basically summing all the values and dividing by the number of examples, but it fails for even a trivial example taken directly from a book.p  pExamplep  precoderequisitions per day  absolute frequency days  relative frequency  8   2  0.016  9   4  0.033 10   6  0.050 11   8  0.066 12  10  0.083 13  12  0.100 14  13  0.108 15  14  0.116 16  12  0.100 17  10  0.083 18   9  0.075 19   7  0.058 20   5  0.041 21   3  0.025 22   2  0.016 23   2  0.016 24   1  0.008 codepre  pThe mean for the Poisson distribution should be 15 according to the book where I got the example. The method that I said above and is in one of the answers gives me 16. Using the sum of the squared euclidean distances I also find that the Poisson with mean 15 is closer to the data than the one with mean 16.p

Negative 1747 pI have a large amount of data that I am pulling from an xml file that all needs to be validated against each other in excess of 500,000 records. It is location data, so it has information such as county, street prefix, street suffix, street name, starting house number, ending number. There are duplicates, house number overlaps, etc. and I need to report on all this data such as where there are issues. Also, there is no ordering of the data within the xml file, so each record needs to be matched up against all others. p  pRight now Im creating a dictionary of the location based on the street name info, and then storing a list of the house number starting and ending locations. After all this is done, Im iterating through the massive data structure that was created to find duplicates and overlaps within each list. I am running into problems with the size of the data structure and how many errors are coming up.p  pOne solution that was suggested to me was to create a temporary SQLite DB to hold all data as it is read from the file, then run through the DB to find all issues with the data, report them out, and then destroy the DB. Is there a bettermore efficient way to do this And any suggestions on a better way to approach this problemp  pAs an fyi, the xml file Im reading in is over 500MB stores other data than just this street information, although that is the bulk of it, but the processing of the file is not where Im running into problems, its only when processing the data obtained from the file.p  pEDIT I could go into more detail, but the poster who mentioned that there was plenty of room in memory for the data was actually correct, although in one case I did have to run this against 3.5 million records, in that instance I did need to create a temporary database.p

Negative 1747 pI am learning regular expression and I would like to check the mechanisms that python is using.p  pI have the regexp  precodes  re.findallurd.d, 123,45.567 78. codepre  pFirst I thought that the result was going to be only 45.567p  pWhen I run it, I got all the numbers including the decimal [123, 45.567, 78] but it is not very clear the process that is used. p  pHere is my understanding  Python starts first with the expression d that will find 123 that is ok greedy search as much as possible before the comma. Next it expects an optional dot . that is not there and it is ok. Next, it expects one or more digits. But the next char is a comma , that is not accepted. Python will back to 12 drop 3. 12 fullfils the first d. Next it expects an optional dot that is not there and next it expects one or more digits and 3 matches it. That is, 123 fullfils the whole regex. p  pWill Python memorize the offset 2 for 123 and start all over again after 123. That is, will Python start using the whole regex at the string 45.567,78.p  pThat is, the whole regex is used thre times. The first time it finds 123. The second time it finds 45.567 and the third time it will find 78.p

Negative 1747 pHere is some a hrefhttpcodepad.orgi0U28cYv relnofollowCRTP based template codea that I used to try and resolve this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8706589requiringoverriddenvirtualfunctionstocallbaseimplementationsRequiring overridden virtual functions to call base implementationsa. I would post code here, but the lines are long and easier to read on codepad.org if needed Ill post here. Its ugly and its somewhat artificial, of course, although it does work. But what I didnt realize at first, that while it compiles on both MSVC and GCC, some template types are not really defined. The part Im questioning is several long inner codeif typeid DerivedN   typeid DerivedN1code symbolic notation in codeTBaseOnEventcode function on top.p  pYou cannot codetypdefcode these types, it will be a compilation error  there is simply not enough derived classes for type to be defined with such long code...TDerived...code chain, so youll get, correctly, compilation error codeTDerived is not defined in TBasecode. Yet compiler eats them through codetypeidcode. When I checked in debugger MSVC compiler output with full symbolic info, it seems that all those long code...TDerived...code that should not really result in any class, in codetypeidcode resolved by compiler to simply the last codeTDerived04code in class chain. And RTTI is pulled for this last class in the class chain, independently of how many code...TDerived...code I have.p  pTaking into account that both MSVC and GCC do that although I only have access to GCC through codepad.org, my question is next is it somehow defined behavior of codetypeidcode Why then codetypedefcode of any of those long code...TDerived...code does not resolve to codeTDerived04code p  pEDIT I mean, Im happy codetypedefcode does not resolve to codeTDerived04code, thatd be disaster for anyone who uses codetypedefcode, but why such inconsistency between codetypeidcode and codetypedefcode p  pEDIT GCC accepts codeTDerived04TDerived04TDerived04TDerived04 lD4code variable declaration. And the type is simply codeTDerived04code in the end. Is there a rule for collapsing scope resolution Apparently, both MSVC and GCC seems to be doing the same in codetypeidcode, but MSVC, unlike GCC, cant handle other scenarios  it gives compile error, requiring arguments for constructors.p

Negative 1747 pI have written some code in Python using imapclient and poplib to collect my emails from my online account. The received emails get saved to a plain text file.p  pWhen I get my email using POP3 is it saved perfectly in the text file with all the carriage returns and line spacings in the correct place. I believe this is because POP3 emails are saved line by line so it will automatically implement the carriage returns for each new line.p  pIMAP on the other hand is not so friendly. The IMAP text contains all the rn with the occasional t, but when I view the text file in vi, notepad, wordpad and word, none of them implement the carriage return, linefeed or tabs. p  pFrom what Ive read the reason is because those programs just see the rn as text and dont know what do to with it.p  pSo my question is, how do I convert the IMAP text so the rn is seen for what it truly is in Windows and Linux using Python.p  pThanks.  p

Later on in the withInputStream block where I do thisp  precodeprintln originalContent    doc..find it.id  editpageform ..find  it.nameoriginalContent.value codepre  pI notice all the original content of the page is stripped of its newlines. I originally thought it was a serverside thing but when I went to make the same req in my browser and view source I could see newlines in the originalContent hidden parameter. Is there an easy way to disable the whitespace normalization and preserve the contents of the field The above was run against a internal Confluence wiki page but could most likely be reproved when editing any arbitrary wiki page.p  pstrongUpdated abovestrong I added a call to slurped.keepWhitespace  true in an attempt to preserve whitespace but that still doesnt work. Im thinking this method is intended for elements and not attributes Is there a way to easily tweak flags on the underlying Java XMLParser Is there a specific setting to set for whitespace in attribute valuesp

Negative 1747 pIm using Spring 3.0.6, with Hibernate 3.2.7.GA in a Javabased webapp. Im declaring transactions with codeTransactionalcode annotations on the strongcontrollersstrong as opposed to in the service layer. Most of the views are readonly.p  pThe problem is, Ive got some DAOs which are using codeJdbcTemplatecode to query the database directly with SQL, and theyre being called outside of a transaction. Which means theyre not reusing the Hibernate codeSessionFactorycodes connection. The reason theyre outside the transaction is that Im using converters on method parameters in the controller, like sop  precodeController Transactional public class MyController      RequestMappingvaluefoofooId, methodRequestMethod.GET     public ModelAndView getPathVariablefooId Foo foo           do something with foo, and return a new ModelAndView        public class FooConverter implements ConverterltString, Foogt      Override     public Foo convertString fooId           call FooService, which calls FooJdbcDao to look up the Foo for fooId       codepre  pMy JDBC DAO relies on codeSimpleJdbcDaoSupportcode to have the codejdbcTemplatecode injectedp  precodeRepositoryfooDao public class FooJdbcDao extends SimpleJdbcDaoSupport implements FooDao      public Foo findByIdString fooId          getJdbcTemplate.queryForObjectselect  from foo where ..., new FooRowMapper          map to a Foo object, and return it       codepre  pand my codeapplicationContext.xmlcode wires it all togetherp  precodeltmvcannotationdriven conversionserviceconversionServicegt  ltbean idconversionService classorg.springframework.context.support.ConversionServiceFactoryBeangt    ltproperty nameconvertersgt        ltsetgt            ltbean classFooConvertergt            lt other converters gt        ltsetgt    ltpropertygt ltbeangt  ltbean idjdbcTemplate classorg.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplategt    ltproperty namedataSource refdataSourcegt ltbeangt ltbean idtransactionManager classorg.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager         psessionFactoryrefsessionFactory gt codepre  pcodeFooConvertercode which converts a path variable codeStringcode to a codeFoocode object gets called before codeMyControllergetcode is called, so the transaction hasnt been started yet. Thus when codeFooJdbcDAOcode is called to query the database, it has no way of reusing the codeSessionFactorycodes connection, and has to check out its own connection from the pool.p  h2So my questions areh2  ol lipIs there any way to share a database connection between the codeSessionFactorycode and my JDBC DAOs Im using codeHibernateTransactionManagercode, and from looking at Springs codeDataSourceUtilscode it appears that sharing a transaction is the emonlyem way to share the connection.pli lipIf the answer to 1 is emnoem, then is there a way to configure codeOpenSessionInViewFiltercode to just start a transaction for us, at the beginning of the request Im using codeonclosecode for the a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm3.3referenceenhtmltransactions.htmltransactionsconnectionrelease relnofollowcodehibernate.connection.releasemodecodea, so the Hibernate Session and Connection are already staying open for the life of the request.pli ol  pThe reason this is important to me is that Im experiencing problems under heavy load where each thread is checking out 2 connections from the pool  the first is checked out by hibernate and saved for the whole length of the thread, and the 2nd is checked out every time a JDBC DAO needs one for a query outside of a transaction. This causes deadlocks when the 2nd connection cant be checked out because the pool is empty, but the first connection is still held. My preferred solution is to make all JDBC DAOs participate in Hibernates transaction, so that codeTransactionSynchronizationManagercode will correctly share the one single connection.p

Negative 1747 pI have a Timer and Im calling some functions in an interval. Right now I have something like thisp  precodeprivate System.Timers.Timer timer private int sync  void Start    timer  new System.Timers.Timerinterval   timer.Elapsed  new ElapsedEventHandlerElapsed   timer.Enabled  true   void Elapsedobject s, ElapsedEventArgs e    if System.Threading.Interlocked.CompareExchangeref sync, 1, 0  0        Parallel.Invoke  gt Function1,  gt Function2,  gt Function3,                       gt Function4       sync  0  codepre  pThis is not bad. I can start the functions parallel AND one function cannot run 2 times, just once this is how I want it. The problem is lets say codefunction4code takes longer then my codeintervalcode, so the other functions have to wait too. If I remove the codesynccode there, the other functions wont wait BUT another codefunction4code call could start in another thread  and I dont want that one functions is running twice. Any suggestions Thank youp
Negative 1747 pI want to add a timeout to individual connections within my request handler for a server using the SocketServer module.p  pLet me start by saying this is the first time Im attempting to do network programming using Python. Ive subclassed SocketServer.BaseRequestHandler and SocketServer.ThreadingTCPServer amp SocketServer.TCPServer and managed to create two classes with some basic threaded TCP functionality. p  pHowever I would like my incoming connections to timeout. Trying to override any of the built in SocketServer timeout values and methods does not work, as the documentation says this works only with forking server. I have managed to create a timer thread that fires after X seconds, but due to the nature of the blocking recv call within the Handler thread, this is of no use, as I would be forced to kill it, and this is something I really want to avoid. p  pSo it is my understanding that I need an asyncore implementation, where I get notified and read certain amount of data. In the event that no data is sent over a period of 5 seconds lets say, I want to close that connection I know how to cleanly do that. I have found a few examples of using asyncore with sockets, but none using SocketServer. So, how can I implement asyncore amp threadingTCPserver   Is it possible  Has anyone done it p

Negative 1747 pI usually use codeMatlabs internal browsercode via, say, the web command, but it has given me a problem by sometimes not detecting when the user clicks next on an online survey I administer through Matlab.

Negative 1747 pIve just enabled sandboxing in my OS X application, and now my Core Audio code doesnt work. In particular, when I call codeAUGraphAddNodecode, it returns the error codeinvalidComponentIDcode, saying just The operation couldnt be completed. A number of other Core Audio calls seem to work correctly before that, though.p  pIt doesnt seem to be a direct sandbox violation, as there arent any messages from sandboxd in Console, but it definitely works when I turn off sandboxing. Anyone know why this would possibly happen The only thing I can imagine is that maybe its trying to read files that I dont have access to, although I would think that would give me a sandboxing error.p  pUpdatep  pTo clarify, Ive tried enabling every sandbox entitlement and the issue still occurs.p  pIve also narrowed down the issue somewhat. That call only fails if I try to add a node with the component type codekAudioUnitTypeMusicDevicecode and subtype codekAudioUnitSubTypeDLSSynthcode.p  pUpdate 2p  pIve figured out a hacky workaround. If I add a temporary exception entitlement to enable readwrite access to the users entire home directory, the error no longer happens. This is obviously not ideal, so Im continuing to search for better options. I tried to narrow down the access required by adding entitlements for more specific subdirectories, but that didnt work.p

Negative 1747 pIm now trying to use the MVVM approach to display some hierarchical data but until now, I didnt implement any specific design pattern. p  pAs simply as I can explain, I have 2 class libraries.   p  ol liLog.cs  li liBackup.cs  li ol  pAnd I have my WPF project.p  pSimply put, the Backup class performs some copy and paste functions. Each copy and paste is logged using the Log class.p  pCurrently, the logs List are stored in memory and this is where maybe there is an issue. When the operation is complete all backups are finished, I want the Logs to be displayed. My backup.cs class creates an instance of the codeMainWindowcode and passes the codeListltLoggtcode object as a constructor, and I bind it to the data context. This works fine. p  pHowever, I now want to use the MVVM approach since I want to use 2 way binding I want to filter by log status success or fail or other states.p  pSo, does any one feel this is possible with my current design or is the only way forward to be saving the logs as an XML file or text or similar just so my Model can be created using LinqToXml Or is there a different approachp

But Excel wont work with the massive number of rows I have to analyze.p  pIve thought about something like thisp  precodeSELECT ,         id,         SELECT 10000  Avgclose  open          FROM   2011          WHERE  id lt 25                 AND id gt  25  13                  AND  close  open  gt 0  SELECT 10000  Avgopen  close                                               FROM   2011                                               WHERE  id lt 25                                                      AND id gt  25  13                                                       AND  open  close  gt 0  FROM   2011  LIMIT  50  codepre  pThe limit 50 is just to keep in manageable. But this doesnt do what I want it to do. It does the math part just right, but it repeats the same number for every row.p  pSo when it is on row 25, it looks at rows 12 through 25. Then for row 26, it looks at rows 13 through 26, etc, which will be a new number for each row. Instead, the SELECT statement above repeats the same number in the last column, which should be different for each row because it has a different range than everything else.p
Negative 1747 pI hava a web application .war deployed to a WebSphere Application Server 7.0.

Negative 1747 pWhat I need is an emorderedem, associative container with string keys, valued by a vector of numbers.  Further, I need codeO1code insertion time.p  pMy description sounds abstract, I shall give you a scenariop  pThere is an online test.  When a person takes this test his name is added into a database. People may take the test repeatedly if they like.  All their scores will be recorded under their name which is unique. For example, David, Tom, Alice come and take the exam a few times. The program should be able to print out the output in following formatp  precodeAlice 65 70 84 David 98 97 93 Tom   100 45  ... codepre  pAs you can see their names should be printed out in lexicographical order. Whenever someone takes the test, his score is added to the database. Since many many people will come take the test, this must be codeO1code time complexity.  However printing out the database also happens frequently say once every second.  It would therefore be advantageous to not have to explicitly sort on each display.p  pWhat data structure can I use here  STL is preferred.  Im currently using an codeunorderedmapcode since it gives me codeO1code insertion, but it cant iterate the keys in lexicographical order.p

Negative 1747 pcodeSystem.out.printlnJava is awesomecodep  pPardon my enthusiasm I just cant believe how powerful Java is, what with its ability to not only save objects and load them, but also with its main purpose, to send them over a network. This is exactly what I must do, for I am conducting a betatest. In this betatest, I have given the testers a version of the game that saves the data as Objects in a location most people dont know about we are the enlightened ones hahaha. This would work fine and dandy, except that it isnt meant for longterm persistence. But, I could collect their coderecord.sercode and codecounter.bincode files the latter tells me how many Objects are in coderecord.sercode via some clientserver interaction with sockets which I know nothing about, until I started reading about it, but I still feel clueless.

Negative 1747 pI have been searching for an answer to this everywhere, and I cant seem to find any simple solution for this. I cant understand why such a simple thing should be so complicated.p  pSo basically  what I want to do is to map up a few local sites on my apache, each of them having their own cssjs etc. Then in my apache conf I set up a few Aliasesp  precode site 1 Alias site1 Cwwwsite1 ltDirectory Cwwwsite1gt     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt   site 2 Alias site1 Cwwwsite2 ltDirectory Cwwwsite2gt     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt codepre  pNow, when I go to the url codehttplocalhostsite1code, the content for site1 will be served  index.html is being loaded. All fine. Within my files I am linking css and js from folders using absolute paths  for example codecssstyles.csscode and codejsscripts.jscode.p  pWhen these files are being served through apache they will get the following pathp  pcodehttplocalhostcssstyles.csscode ignoring the site1, and the reason is of course since Ive asked to go from my webroot localhost by specifying an absolute path.p  pWhy absolute paths I need to be able to move my .html files deeper into the folder structure of my sites  meaning that in relation to where they are  they cannot know where the resource files are  unless I can tell them to start from a certain point  the web root.p  pSo the question isp  pIsnt there any easy way of telling my Alias setup, that any file being asked for  using the absolute path, shoud start with codehttplocalhostsitexcode instead of just codehttplocalhostcode. In other words, the base path is changed.p  pIve tried AliasMatch, DirectoryMatch, RewriteRules RewriteBase, but all seemingly unable to change this.p  pMaybe I should be using something other than Aliasp

I then need the function to choose an indexed value at random from each copied list. So, it might choose the 25th index value in the first copied list, and then it might choose the 60th index value in the next copied list. Then, the index of the value is an argument of a predefined function. The problem is that my copied lists are not being manipulated. p  pmy code is as followsp  precodedef conditionmanipulatevalue     listset[]                  this is the list in which the copied lists will go     for i in range0,value         newlistinitialconditions[]    initialconditions is the list to be copied         listset.appendnewlist         for i in listset           My confusion is here.

Negative 1747 pThere is a common bundle A in my Equinox OSGi application which is used for a common task. But bundle A imports packages from many other bundles depending on circumstance. What I mean is, When Bundle A and Bundle B are in the runtime, A should import package com.b.package1. When Bundle A and Bundle C are in the runtime, A should import package com.c.package2. For this I have to change the import statement in MANIFEST.MF file in bundle A manually every time I want to change the runtime. Is there a way to handle this programatically. Maybe using a custom class loader in bundle A Any help is appreciated.p
Negative 1747 pI need some help from you awesome people.

Negative 1747 pI have made a script which enables adding of dynamic inputs on click of a button and removing unwanted inputs with a corresponding x button. My need is to add the strongxeditablestrong plugin on every newly created dynamic input. Im using xeditable, in such way, that on a selected option from the xeditable popup, an input from the right side gets a value which corresponds to option selected.p  pI have made that work with static elements but with dynamic ones I have big problems. First of all, together with all html structure, classes of all dynamic elements are generated with its strongclassname  number of dynamic fieldstrong. precisely Im doing this with configured Fieldcount codevar FieldCount  1code and then in part where the generation of html code was made you add something like codeclassprivacydynamic FieldCount code. And then the first dynamic element gets the class in html code called codeprivacydynamic2code , second gets codeprivacydynamic3code and so on.p  pNow, my first conclusion is that I need somehow to add a similar option to xeditable in which I would create a script with same  code FieldCount code so every xeditable pop up would correspond to its result input from left rather than one popup to all dynamically made inputs.p  pI tried to generate a xeditable script in the same way I generate my html structure and it did not worked. Silly try from me, I know, generating script with script, but I was desperate.p  pTruly I dont know how it could be solved, Im a bit of a jquery noob, and Im lost in it. Can it even be solved somehowp  pHere is current situation in which you have the first static field with xeditable working, and dynamic fields with same structure for xeditable but without the script for them a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdzorzQxMs7 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdzorzQxMs7ap  phtmlp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt         ltinput typetext classmainactivity idmainactivity namemainactivity placeholderMain activitygt     ltdiv classparentToDelegategt         lta href idprivacy classprivacy datatypeselect datapk1 datavalue1 dataoriginaltitleSelect visibilitygtpublicltagt         ltinput typetext idprivacyresult classprivacyresult value1gt          ltdivgt      ltdiv classrowgt         ltdiv idInputsWrappergt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classrowgt         ltspan idAddMoreBox classbtn btninfo pullrightgtlti classiconplusgtltigtAdd Moreltspangt     ltdivgt codepre  pp  pscriptp  precodexeditable .privacy.editable     showbuttons false,     unsavedclass null,     type select,     inputclass inputmedium privacyselect,     source [         value 1, text public,         value 2, text approved contacts only,         value 3, text matching contacts,         value 4, text invisible     ],    function         .parentToDelegate.onchange keyup blur, .privacyselect, function             .privacyresult.val.privacyselect.val         .blur       dynamic fields document.readyfunction   var MaxInputs        5 maximum input boxes allowed var InputsWrapper    InputsWrapper Input boxes wrapper ID var AddButton        AddMoreBox Add button ID  var x  InputsWrapper.length initlal text box count var FieldCount1 to keep track of text box added  AddButton.clickfunction e  on add input button click           ifx lt MaxInputs max input box allowed                   FieldCount text box added increment         add input box         InputsWrapper.append         ltdivgt         ltinput typetext classotheractivity         nameotheractivity idotheractivity         placeholderOther activity stylemargin0px 15px 10px 0pxgt         lta href classremoveclassgtlti classiconremove iconremoveaddgtltigtltagt             ltdiv classparentToDelegatedynamic FieldCount  parentdynamicgt                 lta href idprivacydynamic classprivacydynamic FieldCount  datatypeselect datapk1 datavalue1 dataoriginaltitleSelect visibilitygtpublicltagt                 ltinput typetext idprivacyresultdynamic FieldCount  nameprivacyresultdynamic FieldCount  classprivacyresultdynamic FieldCount  privacydynamic value1gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         x text box increment           return false   body.onclick,.removeclass, functione user click on remove text     if x gt 1               this.parentdiv.remove remove text box             x decrement textbox                   .incomecount.triggerchange             return false    codepre  pcssp  precode.container    paddingtop100px   .privacyresult, .privacydynamic     width 40px   .mainactivity, .otheractivity     width 140px   .parentToDelegate     displayinline   .iconremoveadd     marginleft 10px     margintop 8px   .parentdynamic     display inline     top 5px     left 10px     position relative  codepre  pAny help or advice is welcome, you can edit my jsfiddle freely and post it backp

Negative 1747 pI need to produce an xml document where all elements and attributes are prefixed with the same namespace I know this is not ideal, but unfortunately is needed for interoperation with InfoPath.

However, it seems that attributes that do not have an associated namespaceprefix do not behave like this   see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions41561xmlnamespacesandattributesXML namespaces and attributesa and a hrefhttpwww.xmlplease.comattributexmlns relnofollowherea, which states p  pAn attribute never inherits the namespace of its parent element. For that reason an attribute is only in a namespace if it has a proper namespace prefixp  pIn this case, shouldnt the serializer generate a prefix to show the attribute is in that namespace Or is this not correctp  pThanks in advancep  pMORE INFO Further investigation see SamuelNeffs answer below has determined that unprefixed attributes do not inherit the namespace of their containing element. Does this mean the XmlSerializer is producing offspec attributes Is there a way to force it to add the prefix It emwillem add a prefix if a different namespace uri is added in the XmlAttribute attribute.p
Negative 1747 pIm using Rubys delayedjobmongoid gem to queue some mapreduce jobs in the background. The jobs process just fine, completing in roughly a minute.p  pNow Im trying to query the status of the jobs while they are processing, but Im finding that any query that I perform on the delayedjobs table while mapreduce is running just hangs there, blocking until all of the jobs have finished.p  pSo for example, if I execute db.delayedjobs.find while mapreduce is running, it just sits there until every last job is finished, then it finally displays the contents of the table which is empty by that point. Its almost as if the entire table is getting locked while the jobs are running. This isnt what I would expect.p  pIve checked and Im not running out of database connections.

If i pause the printer i can see the job gets sent to the printer and the size of the job is 2.12Kb, roughly the size the label should be, but nothing prints out. The light on the Zebra printer for data lights up but nothing will print. I have tried this with two of the Zebra printers we own, so it is not a printer issue. My guess at this point is that maybe the program isnt sending the entire label data to the printer and the end is never received but when i trace through the send request, everthing is sent properly. the printer also shows the job has 00 pages for the label but i cannot understand why it is not sending the label. Is there something special that needs to go at the end of the label data besides the XZ termination character I am also using Delphi XE3 if that helps.p

Negative 1747 pSo a client of mine has signed up with a ticketing company who have convinced them to go with a solution that basically embeds their system on my clients website via an iframe. Yuk.p  pThis means that on my clients events page, theyll be navigating through events in an iframe and the parents url will never change.p  pIm just wondering if theres anything I can do to make that particular problem less of a problem. E.g. on each page load in the iframe, send something to the parents url that identifies what page of the iframe is currently open That way if someone shares the url, or refreshes via the browser, theyre not left back at the starting page in the iframe.p  pI can probably get a javascript file of my own added to the iframe, not sure how much else I could manipulate the iframe.p  pAny suggestions would be awesome.p  pThanksp

Negative 1747 pIm attempting to install an archive build of my app using iPhone Configuration Utility but am unable to. The app appears in the Applications section, however when I click on the Devices section, then choose the Applications tab it isnt listed there.p  pI think this might be because I changed the app name and the app with the old name is still listed in iPhone Configuration Utility and as they have the same app id it may be getting confused. However there seems to be no way to delete the old app from within iPhone Configuration Utility to see if this clears the problem.p

In order to collect as much data as I can, and be able to easily add additional connections to services, Id really like to have each new connection as a onetomany record.

Negative 1747 pIm using a pretty basic implementation of Core Data to store some objects in my app. The code is pretty much boiler plate code that Xcode creates as the model is as simple as they get dont even have any relationships, just stand alone managed objects.p  pEverything works fine in iOS7, but in iOS 6 when deleting an object in the table view iOS removes the rows, then the fetchedResultsController immediately does a NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert and adds the deleted objects back to the table view. p  pIf I navigate away from the table view and then back to it the rows are gone confirming they are deleted, but why is the controller calling NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert in iOS 6 I can confirm this is not even called in iOS 7 at all.p  pIve created a blank app in Xcode to compare the code to mine to make sure I didnt mess something up and the code is identical as I can see it. Can anyone explain this problem Ive not used Core Data before so I may be missing something obvious.p  pThe only once difference in my code is that when I delete an object I also delete a jpg in the documents directory if it exists. p

Negative 1747 pApologies in advance for the lengthy post, just trying to explain the situation clearly.p  pIve created a PHPdriven website for searching a big millions of records MySQL database of people. On the search page you have your usual form for search criteria. Due to the way the people often use the site, the search criteria are saved into session variables so that if the search page is reloaded the previous criteria remain in the form fields theres a button to manually reset the criteria, of course. This in itself works fine.p  pI also have two language selection links that store the language selection in a session variable making the page header load an appropriate localization file, and as above, this in itself also works fine.p  pWhats problematic is that when a user gets the search result, a list of people, and wants to open up detailed info on a person thus going from search.php to info.php and then wants to go back to the people listing via the back button, it takes too long to reload the previous page as the page resends the MySQL query etc, instead of going back to a cached page. It can take even 5 seconds or more sometimes as the queries produce up to 5000 results  but even say, 200500 results takes long to reload because the database itself is big and not the fastest in the world. And limiting the number of results isnt really practical.p  pThe obvious solution at first glance would SEEM to be enabling the browser cache. Which is exactly what I did via PHP header and pragma controls. And all seemed well, as going back to the list was basically instantaneous. However, I realized that enabling the cache means the updated session variables dont work. New search criteria doesnt properly replace the old ones when reloading the search page after having been to a different page, and even though you select another language, pages open up in the language you previously were using, because thats the way they were cached You can force the language to update via F5, but that doesnt seem to help the search criteria much. But even if it did, F5spam isnt really an answer, it needs to work automatically.p  pSo long story short, how do I make the search result list open quickly without making session variables useless Or will I simply have to make do with sluggish page loads when using back button, thus annoying users I really dont want to open the info.php in a new page, either.p

Negative 1747 pWhat is the best practice to write a cross platform implementation of the x86 pause instruction I am planning to use it in a busy spinning loop in a C 11 project.p  pIf I was only using the gcc toolchain then I could use the mmpause intrinsic. Does this intrinsic do the right thing even when the native processor does not support the x86 pause instruction I would also like my code to work on the clangllvm toolchain too.p  pI imagine that a fallback could use stdthisthreadsleepfor since I am using C 11. But I am not sure how to detect processor capability supports pause vs does not and fall back to sleep.p  pI am using cmake to build my project and also will always build and deploy on the same machine. So I am comfortable detecting processor settings during compilation.p  pAn example implementation pseudocode is p  precodevoid pause   Not sure how to detect if pause is available on the platform. if definedUSEmmpause   asm  pause  else   stdthisthreadsleepforstdchronoseconds0 endif  codepre

Negative 1747 pI was looking at ways to include a title in a page and I have come across this website see image below which does exactly what I want but I cant figure out how to accomplish it. The trouble I have is in only having a single title image at the top without it repeating through to the bottom. I have used the css backgroundimageurlimage on the main div but the repeating image problem is present. Any help or insight on this matter will be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT I need the rest of the background to repeat until the end. I think having the rest of the background be a separate image may be part of the solution but I dont know if a title image div can be forced to the same layer. Again any insight is valuable as I am new to HTML and CSS. Also this is the best example website I can find, if you are offended please edit with a better example. Thank Youp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcr8p9.jpg altenter image description herep
Negative 1747 pIm observing a strange behavior and would like to know if it is Intel Xeon Phi related or not. p  pI have a little example code basically the matrix multiplication everyone knows three nested for loops. I offload the computation to an Intel MIC with OpenMP 4.0 codetargetcode pragma and map the three matrices with codemaptoA,Bcode codemaptofromCcode. p  pNow, what I am observing is that for small matrices e.g. 1024x1024 the memory transfer took extremely long. Compared to the native version same code, same parallelisation strategy, just no offloading the offload version consumes about 320ms more time. I did a warmup run of the code to remove initialization overhead. p  pCompared to a Nvidia Tesla K20 where the same amount of memory is copied without noticing this 320ms are very bad. p  pAre there some environment settings that may improve the memory transfer speedp  pAn additionally question  I enabled offload reporting via the OFFLOADREPORT environment variable. What are the differences between the two timing results shown in the reportp  precode[Offload] [HOST]  [Tag 5] [CPU Time]        26.995279seconds [Offload] [MIC 0] [Tag 5] [CPUgtMIC Data]   3221225480 bytes [Offload] [MIC 0] [Tag 5] [MIC Time]        16.859548seconds [Offload] [MIC 0] [Tag 5] [MICgtCPU Data]   1073741824 bytes codepre  pWhat are those 10 seconds missing at MIC Time memory transferp  pWell a third question.

Negative 1747 pI was under the impression that in order to use delete or delete[], I only need to provide the address and the object type.

Negative 1747 pI have a simple iOS game nearing completion. It runs quite smoothly on new devices, however running it on an iPhone 4S with iOS 7 is hopeless. p  pTime profiling it, it seems that a lot of computing power is used on setting the codecentercode property of codeUIViewscode, which are set every frame on multiple objects on the screen at any time. Running these functions concurrently using codedispatchasynccode results in very weird behavior in which the different objects in the game do not move at the time or speed that they are supposed to.p  pI have found no way in which I can speed things up a little. p  pThis is a simple 2D game, it should not take this toll on an iOS device.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 1747 pIn my app I have a sort of dashboard with buttons, images, labels, etc. This dashboard is common, apart from small variations, to several view controllers. I thought that a neat solution would be to implement the dashboard as a separate view controller that is included by means of embed segues and view containers in all the view controllers that need it. This works perfectly. However, I have many view controllers in my storyboard, and most of them are connected to the dashboard view controller, which makes the storyboard completely unreadable or, at least, the connections in it. Is it possible then to create all these connections programmatically so that the connections go away from the SB It seems to be possible to create segues programmatically, but what about embed segues If this is not a viable solution, what are the alternativesp

For larger systems with graphs going deep into five or six levels, the entities need to be converted to a DTO to make it simple. Unless the UI has some CRUD screens for entities, large applications end up with more DTOs and less entities. Most of the time, these DTOs will represent what UI wants and is equivalent to a presentation model.p  pWhy cant we consider what we deal with at the client as presentation models rather than entitiesp

Negative 1747 pI am currently learning C using Lynda.com tutorials, I am a complete beginner and am following the tutorials on how to set up Eclipse on my Mac. When I initially run the versiontest.cpp program provided, it runs fine with the expected output GCC version 4.2.1p  pThe tutorial requires my Mac to be running GCC version 4.7.0 or above and it explains how to upgrade GCC. The tutorial instructs me to save the updated GCC files within my home directory within the folder hpcgcc and then follows on to explain the method to set my PATHs to find this folder.p  pNow when I run the versiontest.cpp program it fails with the following errorp  pdyld Library not loaded usrlocalliblibmpc.3.dylib Referenced from Usersgaryhpcgccbin..libexecgccx8664appledarwin13.1.04.9.0cc1plusp  pReason image not foundp  pSo from this message I can see that the system cannot find the required files within usrlocallib.p  pI am able to copy the files from hpcgccbin to usrlocallib and have the program compile and run correctly but I am hoping to find out why Eclipse cannot read the required files directly from hpcgccbinp  pI have spent the last 2 hours searching forums and search engines for the answer but I am no further forward.

Negative 1747 pI am using Spring framework for my web app and i am currently using MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter in my DispatcherServlet.xml to map the data . In my application when the user enters a currency, commas are itself attached to the value. The Json converter is unable to parse through the string with commas. In my modal class the currency has data type double. So i want the Json converter to ignore the commas and give me a double value on the server side. Is there a way we can do this. p  pexample.if I am sending this data  price  1,234,555.76       This gives me a parse error  p  pit works fine when the data is  price  1234555.76p

Let me explain with an example.p  pInside my controller class I have a code piece p  blockquote   pAdminUser adminUser new AdminUserp blockquote  pSo when 2 Admins signsin to my web application, there will be 2 Objects of the class AdminUser with same reference variable adminUserp  ol liHow is it possible, is it 2 different threadsli liWho is managing this threads, web containerli liIf so, how web container is doing it, is it wrapping application code with threadLocalli liIf its different threads, to maintain a global object say a counter for the admins visit counts, static wont suffice... it needs to be volatile instead, correctli ol

Negative 1747 pDoes anyone have any experience in moving a simple 4 lead, bipolar stepper motor with a Pontech BigEasy Kard and a quick420 board I am simply trying to take the included Arduino examples of controlling stepper motors, and port them over so that they will operate properly within the Pontech environment. The code I am trying to convert is as followsp  precode   Stepper Motor Control  one revolution   This program drives a unipolar or bipolar stepper motor.

Negative 1747 pI am working within an existing PHP program that has an established way that it dynamically loads certain PHP files for rendering HTML, by doing something basically thisp  precodetry      includeFilePath  realpathmySubPath     include includeFilePath  catch Exception e      imagine code that handles error  codepre  pAssume that both file to be included and the file containing the above method are readonly and its not permissible to alter these actual files on disk. However the above method may be overridden by extending the class it is part of. Meanwhile the file thats being included cannot be overridden gracefully because it does not contain classes, just a mix of PHP and HTML instructions old school phtml. p  pNow what I want to do instead isp  precodetry      includeFilePath  realpathmySubPath     codeToModify  substrfilegetcontentsincludeFilePath,5     codeToEval  thisgtmodifyCodecodeToModify     evalcodeToExecute  catch Exception e      imagine code that handles error  codepre  p... where the strongmodifyCodestrstrong method is defined elsewhere, and basically what it would do is a check the existing file against a preknown hash checksum value to ensure it has not been modified, and b inject known safe code into it in order to add additional functionality to the application its known safe because we also would use a similar hash verification system on it emandem validate it. p  pNow my question is, assuming that security risks are not a concern here, is there any functional reason why eval would be problematic p  pNote no files wed be including have closing html tags, only opening ones. I chose to use strongsubstrstr,5strong to trim the opening tag as opposed to adding opening and closing tags as Ive seen done elsewhere that ought to work, rightp  hr  pExplanationp  pSince I anticipate a lot of you might wonder, Why would you want to do that, the reason is fairly complicated, but Ill try to explain it. The alternative to doing the above would be to include an entirely different file one that already contains the custom code I want to use on top of the code from the base file. However the custom code I want to use is all additional code not present in the original base file, so we would end up with a fair amount of duplicated code instead of a more elegant solution where only the new code is injected into the base code prior to execution. Even still, using a new file that contains both the old and new code would technically work fine emfor nowem. p  pThe problem is, though, in the future its entirely possible that when we upgrade the base program, there will be changes to the original file the one thats been effectively overridden by using my custom version of it. If that happens, our override would continue to rely on the emprevious versionsem code for that file, since the part of it that carried over from the original base system would no longer match up with the emnew versionsem normal default code for that file. p  pSo, to address that problem, I want to go with the method of injecting the code using my custom emmodifyCodestrem method. That method can tell if theres been any updates to the original file whether due to a hacker or due to system update and it would be able to then warn the admin to check out why this code has changed, and issue an approval before executing the modified version of the code by updating the checksum with the hash of the new version of the file to be overridden. That way we can safely update the system and know it will fall back on the default behavior of the new version of the system rather than continue to run old code which risks breaking the system or adding mods intended for old versions of the code to new versions of the code that they havent yet been tested on. p  pI hope that makes sense.p
Negative 1747 pIve spent the last two days beating my head against a wall trying to change Theme in my app. Ive taken the basic Hello World app from the SDK examples and have been learning Android by modifying it. Currently Im trying to change the Theme. Im testing it on my Nexus 7 running the latest OS and Im using Eclipse. Experienced with Java but new to Android.p  pIn my manifest I have p  blockquote   pandroidthemestyleAppBaseThemep blockquote  pIn valuesv11styles I havep  blockquote   pstyle nameAppBaseTheme parentandroidTheme.Blackp blockquote  pHave tried all Have tried all sorts of combinations in fact. Ive also tried using Holo and am aware I need to be V11 or higher to do that.p  pWhen I try running my app it starts on the tablet and I can see the black background as expected, but before it can draw any components Eclipse goes to debug mode in ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity and then into ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.run before my app dies.p  pIf I use this its finep  blockquote   pstyle nameAppBaseTheme parentstyleTheme.AppCompat.Lightp blockquote  pI feel Im missing something obvious or theres a fundamental part of Themes that I dont understand. But Ive tried for two days and failed. Have tried removing the .android directory and restarting Eclipse, that fixed a few other issues. Any help appreciated. p  pI know the  symbol in this context denotes that it is an inbuilt style by android. Does that mean I have to add something to my app to link in other themes If so what exactlyp

I also tried the name codecp1250code but while again working for both Win and Linux, it didnt change the situation for Android.p  pTherefore I believe that these codecs are really missing and asking for help in solving this.

Negative 1747 pI currently have a setup based on the meanjs stack boilerplate where I can have users logged in this state of being loggedin stays as I navigate the URLs of the site. This is due to holding the user object in a Service which becomes globally available.p  pHowever this only works if I navigate from my base root, i.e. from  and by navigation only within my app.p  pIf I manually enter a URL such as page1 it loses the global user object, however if I go to my root homepage and navigate to page1 via the site. Then its fine, it sees the global user object in the Service object.p  pSo I guess this happens due to the full page refresh which loses the global value where is navigating via the site does not do a refresh so you keep all your variables.p  pSome things to notep  ol liI have enabled HTML5Mode, using prefix of .li liI use UIRouter li liI use a  tag with li liI have a rewrite rule on express that after loading all my routes, I have one last route that takes all  to and sends back the root index.html file, as that is where the angularjs stuff is.li ol  pIm just wondering what people generally do here Do they revert the standard cookies and local storage solutions Im fairly new to angular so I am guessing there are libraries out there for this.p  pI just would like to know what the recommended way to deal with this or what the majority do, just so I am aligned in the right way and angular way I suppose.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIf I manually navigate to another URL on my site via the address bar, I lose my user state, however if I manually go back to my root via the address bar, my user state is seen again, so it is not simply about loosing state on window refresh. So it seems it is related to code running on root URL.p  pI have an express rewrite that manually entered URLs due to HTML5 Location Mode should return the index.html first as it contains the AngularJs files and then the UIRoute takes over and routes it properly.p  pSo I would have expected that any code on the root would have executed anyway, so it should be similar to navigating via the site or typing in the address bar. I must be missing something about Angular that has this effect.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pRight so more investigation lead me to thisp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var user   user  json  safe  ltscriptgt codepre  pWhich is a server side code for index.html, I guess this is not run when refreshing the page to a new page via a manual URL.p  pUsing the hash bang mode, it works, which is because with hash bang mode, even I type a URL in the browser, it does not cause a refresh, where as using HTML5 Mode, it does refresh. So right now the solution I can think of is using sessionStorage.p  pUnless there better alternativesp  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pIt seems the best way to handle this when using HTML5Mode is that you just have to have a rewrite on the express server and few other things.p

Negative 1747 pSo Ive been learning about Buffer Overflow as well as the Procedure for saving memory onto the stack and ive been bothered I dont understand certain conventions.  When saving local variables arrays why is that we allocate memory from the stack pointer to the base pointerp  parray[0] would be closer to the top of the stack and array[1] to array [n1] would be closer to the base pointer of your framep  pWhy not the other way around if array[n1] was allocated towards the stack pointer there would be no threat to the saved registers return addresses in the previous frame.p  pIve read the wiki article and the stacks that grow up section, but they assume the return address is there before the buffer is allocated, which would mean the buffer overwrites the return.  But shouldnt it be the other way around Shouldnt the return address be written in the stack only after the local variables are declaredp

Incase it matters the code Im using to display the player is the followingp  precodeattr  array     src gt audio  echo wpaudioshortcodeattr codepre  pIf anyone knows of a way to fix this issue thatd be great If you need any more information let me know.p  p[EDIT]p  pLooking at the network requests now too, it seems like it cant download the audio file either, the file is in the list of requests twice, each without a http status and a duration of between 0.2ms0.5ms, which for a full length mp3 track obviously isnt right. p  p[EDIT]p  pIve also tried disabling all plugins and reverting to the default theme, although everything appears to load in correctly and the audio plays, if you inspect the timeline it still fails to finish running the codemediaelementandplayer.min.jscode file, meaning that if there was an on load event in the jQuery, it would never get fired.p
Negative 1747 pI am building a Chrome App with a Leaflet Map for offline use. The app will fetch map tiles via XMLHttpRequest to avoid the CSP restrictions. Then the tiles will be stored on the file system with the correct URL pattern for subsequent retrieval. I assume the chrome.fileSystem API is the best choice, but the documentation is hard to follow for this use case.p  p1 What is the path to the map tile filesp  p2 Can this path be part of the App Files ie Can I create a Tiles directory and prepopulate it with tiles and have user accessed tiles added to itp  p3 What is the best way to test if a file exists, then if not, go fetch it, add it to the folder, then serve the newly downloaded tile to original requestp  p4 Or is there a better way to make offline mapsp  pThe goal is to allow users to prefetch map tiles while WiFi is available, then use the maps where it is not, as an HTML5 Chrome App.p

Negative 1747 pI need to write multiple tests e.g. login test, use application once logged in tests, logout test, etc. and need them all to be in separate files. The issue I run into is after each test, at the beginning of the next test being run, a new browser session start and it is no longer logged in due to the new session, so all my tests will fail except the login test. p  pSo, is there a way to use the same browser session to run all of my tests sequentially without having to duplicate my login code Sorry if this is a repost but I have searched and researched and not found any answers.p  pOR, is there a way to chain the test files somehow Like having one file that you run that just calls all the other test filesp

Negative 1747 pI am developing some software in CC for a linear algebra tool that involves multiplying large matrices 500GB out of core, in the sense that they are never fully loaded into the memory.  As such, I will load it in batches, and perform the multiplication piecewise several rows at a time using Intels MKL gemm functions.p  pI wanted to know if there are any good patterns to parallelize the reading and the multiplication.  Say the machine has 8 cores.  I would like one core to be reading in the batches, while the other 7 cores are performing the multiplication.  Since you can only efficiently read data with one core, it would involve the 7 others waiting idly while the batch is read.   As such, I would like to parallelize them such that the multiplication is happening while the reading is happening.p  pIm not really sure how this would look would I load 1000 rows and then let the gemm functions take over while another core is loading another 1000 rows  p

Negative 1747 pI am trying to translate codePolynomial45,67,10010code in python to give me a clean output of the form of p  precode[out] 10X100  7X6  5X4 codepre  pas a string. p  pSo the first entry of the dictionary matches to the exponent of codeXcode and the second entry to its coefficient, always starting with the smallest exponent ascending to the highest. To get a feeling for the situation I tried to iterate over the dictionary and noticed that the output is not what I would expectp  pFor instance if I setup the dictionary such as above codedictionary  45,67,10010code and I perform a print in the like of p  precodefor exponent in dictionary     print exponent codepre  pI get the output 100,4,6. Which is not very intuitive to me. However I looked into the codeoperatorcode module and some similar questions on this website and came up with the following piece of code. p  precodeimport operator codepre  pcodeclass Polynomialobject     def initself, polynom           self.polynom  polynom         self.polystring  self.nicePolynompolynomcodep  precodedef strself     return self.polystring  def nicePolynomself, polynom     sortedpolynom  sortedpolynom.items, keyoperator.itemgetter0     sortedpolynom.reverse       for element in sortedpolynom         exponent  strelement[0]         coefficient  strelement[1]          term  coefficient  X  exponent         print term          return term codepre  pWhich does basically what I want. However I am clueless on how to make it fit all together. My current output induced by the rudimentary print statement in the code isp  precode10X100 7X6 5X4 codepre  pand of course the return statement which just evaluates to 5X4. I do want the above output to be all in one line and have a    in between them just as in the output example above. However without writing very very ugly code uglier than the one above I cant complete this. p

Negative 1747 pI am checking for USB drive removal on linux.  I am simply monitoring the output of a command line process with childprocess.spawn.  But for some reason the childs stdout data event doesnt emit until like 20 lines have been printed, which makes it unable to detect a removed drive.  After removing the drive many times, it does finally go.  But obviously that wont do.p  pOriginal div classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodevar udevmonitor  requirechildprocess.spawnudevadm, [monitor, udev] udevmonitor.stdout.ondata, functiondata    return console.logdata.toString codepre div div p  pPretty simple.  So I figure its an issue with the piping node is using internally.  So instead of using the pipe, I figure Ill just use a simple passthrough stream.

Perhaps you can run the command udevadm monitor udev in another terminal to see what happens.  Remove and reinsert a few times and eventually node will print out.p

Negative 1747 pI was watching a Pluralsight course on React and the instructor stated that props should not be changed. Im now reading this article a hrefhttpsgithub.comuberVUreactguideblobmasterpropsvsstate.md relnofollowhttpsgithub.comuberVUreactguideblobmasterpropsvsstate.mda on props vs state and it says Both props and state changes trigger a render update.

Negative 1747 pI have a ringcompojure application and I want to apply different middleware depending on whether the route is part of the web application or part of the api which is json based. p  pI found some answers to this question on stack overflow and other forums, but these answers seem more complicated than the solution Ive been using. I wanted to know if there are drawbacks with how Im doing it and what I may be missing in my solution.  A very simplified version of what Im doing isp  precode  defroutes approutes     GET  [req] dumpreq     routenotfound Not Found  defroutes apiroutes   GET api [req] dumpreq  def app   routes gt apiroutes               wrapdefaults apidefaults           gt approutes               wrapdefaults sitedefaults codepre  pNote that there is more middleware than I have shown here. p  pThe only restriction Ive encountered is that as the approutes has the notfound route, it needs to come last or it will be triggered before finding the api routes. p  pThis seems simpler and more flexible than some of the other solutions Ive found, which appear to either use additional conditional middleware, such as ring.middleware.conditional or what seems to me as more complex routing definitions where there is an additional defroutes layer and the need to define defroutes with ANY  etc. p  pI suspect there is something subtle Im missing here and while my approach seems to work, it will cause unexpected behaviour or results in some situations etc. p

However, I also would like to expand again these same groups that were expanded before Group A and B. I decided to collapse all of the expanded groups and then open again those that were expanded before, because there may be some expanded groups that I need to collapse before removing so that its children dont stay in the list. In this way, if we have the list below em, I want the groups A and B to be expanded and C to be collapsed before it is automatically removed using the notifyDataSetChanged, because the notifityDataSetChanged doesnt remove the children from the removed groups.

If I wait something like 50 milliseconds and execute the expandGroups again everything works properly. So, Ive been searching but I cannot figure out if there is a function in the ExpandableListView API that can tell me if the ExpandableListView is ready for me to expand some of its groups. Ive tried to override the codeonFinishInflatecode from ExpandableListView, but this is only called on the first time the ExpandableListView is created. So, is there any function either from the adapter or the ExpandableListView that is fired up exactly when the ExpandableListView is ready for me to expand its groups after the notifyDataSetChanged has been executed on the adapterp  pThank you.p

So I opened up XCode, went to the downloads window and saw it wasnt installed anymore.  I have no idea how that happened, but Im guessing XCode updated itself and removed it.  So, I download and install the 8.2 SDK again.  However, when it finished, my project still wouldnt run I received the exact same error.

I am able to run both the code.rbcode script and the rake task flawlessly in my dev environment.p  pAfter reading a hrefhttpsdevcenter.heroku.comarticlesdynosephemeralfilesystem relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12416738howtouseherokusephemeralfilesystemthisa on how the ephemeral file system works, strongI am thinking that the task actually is working, but the file gets destroyed or is actually there but I cant see it when I use codelscode in codeheroku run bashcode.strong p  pstrongemCan someone please explain what is going on to me If my efforts to get a file from S3 written to my app on Heroku are futile And if there are any alternativesemstrong p  pemIf I cant figure it out after this then I am going to set up my own env in EC2.emp
Negative 1747 pIm wondering if xCode auto layout  constraints are really as frustrating as I think, or am I just not understanding them.  For example, I started with this basic label in the view controllerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com18BRH.png altinitialControllerp  pFair enough.  A box with text that has equal margins on the leftright and a smaller top margin.  Now when I run any size device, that gets skewedcut off from the device view.  So right away for some reason Xcode thinks that despite me putting the entire label in the view controller, it things it should display halfway off the screen.  Dont get it but okay, so I went ahead and added auto layout constraits to the right, left and top margins.  The result isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFUiDX.png altwithMarginsp  pSo it centered it, which is nice, but now it just ignores the fact that I made the width larger and it just shrinks it down anyways  For something so simple this seems to be very...unreliable.  I then added the aspect ratio constraint and it seemed to look fine in all of the devices...finallyp  pI curiously also simply tried to get rid of all those, and simply add the aspect ratio constraint and the horizontal center in container constraint.  On the main storyboard preview not the simulator it looked like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVt9MA.png altaspectAndHorizontalp  pNot what Im looking for, as its not stretched downward like I want, they shrunk it again.  However...when actually running it in the simulator...it looks perfect, the way I want it to in the first picture of the view controller.p  pWhy the preview and simulator differed, I suppose from reading other questions its because there were a few warnings after I added these.  One was that the horizontal and vertical positions are one initially and will be different at run time.  But when I ran it, it definitely held the initial ones and not the ones they said it would be at run time.  It also told me that vertical position was ambiguous...well yeah I only set a center and aspect ratio...pretty obvious and not sure how Id even solve that error.  It solves it when I delete the horizontal center...but now its not centered which is a step back from what I wanted.p  pLong story short, how do I deal with this.  My previews and simulations arent accurate with each other even for the simplest auto layout specifics.  Apps nowadays are so complicated and on every device they scale and work beautifully, and this seems to not agree with even just one label.p  pDoes anybody have any good articles, advice, or anything that would help me  This auto layout stuff seems to be so picky and thats really all I know so I have to deal with it.  And dont even get me started on why the text doesnt scale with the label...why would I want the text on an iphone 4 to be the same on an ipad even when my label is increasing in size with the devicep  pA lot to go through, but its just very frustrating and I cant see myself doing much else before I try to understand these basics.  Thank you and much appreciated.p

I followed the method suggested by samgak, everything looks to work ok but the color is very distorted. Im uploading two captures, the first one is with rgb888 and looks well, like it should do. The second one is the conversion with the distorsion.

Negative 1747 pI am hoping someone can help me with a query. So far I have an excel spreadsheet and you select a cell and then click a button, the button opens a userform with a scroll bar on and as you use the scroll bar this edits the number in cell by 1 updown to bounds that you type into text boxes.

Negative 1747 pIve been looking at the same problem for so long Im probably missing a simple solution here.p  pI created a small library to provide a custom UIView that sticks to the keyboard like the one for iMessage does aka doesnt hide with keyboard a hrefhttpsgithub.comoseparovicMessageComposerView relnofollowhttpsgithub.comoseparovicMessageComposerViewap  pBasically the problem Im experiencing is that when the user inits custom view I want a view with the following default rect initializedp  precodeCGFloat defaultHeight  44.0 CGRect frame  CGRectMake0,                           [self currentScreenSize].heightdefaultHeight,                           [self currentScreenSize].width,                           defaultHeight codepre  pThis requires that the currentScreenSize is calculated within the UIView. Ive tried multiple implementations all of which have their downsides. There doesnt seems to be a good solution due to this breaking principles of MVC.p  pThere are lots of duplicate questions on SO but most assume you have access to the rest of the code base e.g. the app delegate which this custom view does not so Im looking for a self contained solution.p  pHere are the two leading implementations Im usingp  hr  pstrongNextResponderstrongp  pThis solution seems to be fairly successful in a wide variety of scenarios. All it does is get the next responders frame which very conveniently doesnt include the nav or status bar and can be used to position the UIView at the bottom of the screen.p  pThe main problem is that codeself.nextRespondercode within the UIView is codenilcode at the point of initialization, meaning it cant be used at least not that I know to set up the initial frame. Once the view has been initialized and added as a subview though this seems to work like a charm for various repositioning uses.p  precode CGSizecurrentScreenSize       return the screen size with respect to the orientation     return UIViewself.nextResponder.frame.size  codepre  hr  pstrongApplicationFramestrongp  pThis was the solution I was using for a long time but its far more bulky and has several problems. First of all, by using the applicationFrame you have to deal with the nav bar height as it will otherwise offset the position of your view. This means you have to determine if it is visible, get its height and subtract it from your currentSize.p  pGetting the nav bar unfortunately means you need to access the UINavigationController which is not nearly as simple as accessing the UIViewController. The best solution Ive had so far is the below included codecurrentNavigationBarHeightcode. I recently found an issue though where this will fail to get the nav bar height if a UIAlertView is present as code[UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.rootViewControllercode will evaluate to codeUIAlertShimPresentingViewControllercodep  precode CGSizecurrentScreenSize       there are a few problems with this implementation. Namely nav bar height      especially was unreliable. For example when UIAlertView height was present      we couldnt properly determine the nav bar height. The above method appears to be      working more consistently. If it doesnt work for you try this method below instead.     return [self currentScreenSizeInInterfaceOrientation[self currentInterfaceOrientation]]    CGSizecurrentScreenSizeInInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationorientation       httpstackoverflow.coma7905540740474       get the size of the application frame screensize  status bar height     CGSize size  [UIScreen mainScreen].applicationFrame.size       if the orientation at this point is landscape but it hasnt fully rotated yet use landscape size instead.      handling differs between iOS 7 ampamp 8 so need to check if size is properly configured or not. On      iOS 7 height will still be greater than width in landscape without this call but on iOS 8      it wont     if UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscapeorientation ampamp size.height gt size.width          size  CGSizeMakesize.height, size.width            subtract the height of the navigation bar from the screen height     size.height  [self currentNavigationBarHeight]      return size    UIInterfaceOrientationcurrentInterfaceOrientation       Returns the orientation of the Interface NOT the Device. The two do not happen in exact unison so      this point is important.     return [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation    CGFloatcurrentNavigationBarHeight       TODO this will fail to get the correct height when a UIAlertView is present     id nav  [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.rootViewController     if [nav isKindOfClass[UINavigationController class]]          UINavigationController navc  UINavigationController  nav         ifnavc.navigationBarHidden              return 0          else              return navc.navigationBar.frame.size.height                   return 0  codepre  hr  pDoes anyone have suggestion about how I can best calculate the UIViewController size from within this UIView. Im totally open to other suggestions on how to stick the UIView to the bottom of the screen upon initialization that I may have overlooked. Thank youp

Moreover, no need to know the environment once the application has started. Furthermore, only the Listener holds a reference to the resource manager which has  a method codeshutdowncode which will be called on the codecontextDestroyedcode method of the Listener itself. Please also note that the factory itself has a single method codecreatePlugincode. This method creates a brand new instance of the plugin which contains the business logic API.p  pNow, we started using Spring. I would like to achieve the same result, maybe taking advantage of the mechanism described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29250080injectanewinstanceofanobjectintoeachrequesthandlerherea for the class codeMyRequestFoocode. p  pWe would like to get rid of the context storing horrible, IMHO so that the handlers that require the plugin can simply add in the signature the type.p  pBut Im stuck. Can anyone provide a valid solution for this Is there a way to initialize a provider at Spring startup Is it possible to have the cleanup feature we already have in the Listener above I love that resources get freed in a very clean way on shutdown....p
Negative 1747 pIm porting some Fortran90 code to C because Im stupid, to save the Why.p  pFortran allows specification of ranges on arrays, in particular, starting at negative values, egp  precodedouble precision  NameOfArrayFirstSize, 33 codepre  pI can write this in C as something likep  precodestdarrayltstdarrayltdouble, 7gt, FirstSizegt NameOfArray codepre  pbut now I have to index like codeNameOfArray[0FirstSize1][06]code.

Negative 1747 pIm aware of the reiterative kind of questions about this topic, but I still cant find a proper answer anywhere.p  pThe view controller that receives data implements the delegate method and sets the delegate to self. The sending view controller fires the method, so the receiver gets the data. So far so good. But when I jump back to my receiving view controller, a new instance of this view controller is created and Ive lost my data again. How do you avoid this problem What am I missing Thanks a lot.p
