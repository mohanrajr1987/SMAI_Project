All I want to do is center two labels on the same line so that they are always in the center so matter what screen it is on. p  pI want the two labels to act as one stack so you can just center the stack and as a result both labels together will look like they are centered. p  pI have stacked them but I dont know how to get rid of the borders and fill, I just want to display two labels, no borders or fill. p  pIm sure there is a way to do this without code.

Positive 28649 pImagine an app like Wikipedia for the Apple TV, where it has a block of text that contains information about a given topic. Some words or phrases in the text could be other available topics you could read. Therefore you need to make those wordsphrases into focusable and clickable buttons.p  pOn a web page its really easy to do this with links, and its easy to style the links to look different from the noninteractive text. On tvOS, it would be easy to apply attributes to ranges in the text using codeNSAttributedStringcode where you can determine the start and end index of the phrases  thats not a problem.p  pMy question is, how would you go about actually creating the focusable buttons for text that is in the text view I was thinking about somehow determining the rect that surrounds each phrase, and adding invisible buttons on top of them, then when it becomes focused make it visible so the user knows its active. Im not convinced thats a good approach. Also allowing all buttons to be focusable as expected could be tricky.p  pLooking into this, others have recommended using a web view and showing that in the app because its easy to make the buttons links inside a paragraph tag for example. But codeUIWebViewcode isnt available for tvOS. p  pWhats a good solution to this problem It will need to allow the user to intuitively focus and navigate between the text buttons. In this specific case, we could assume the text view will not scroll, therefore a codeUILabelcode could be used instead of a codeUITextViewcode if necessary.p  pWikipedia on the web  need to map to Apple TV appp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6DxVC.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6DxVC.png altWikipediaap
Positive 28649 pSo my question is more of a challenge in the end. Maybe Im going into a wrong direction so I though maybe I could ask for ideas.p  pstrongthe contextstrongp  pI have a set of string place names and I want to suggest answers based on user inputs in a UITextView.p  pstrongThe methodstrongp  pI Used a combination of two UILabels and one UITextView to achieve a working results The suggestionLabel is in the background, the searchLabel in the middle, and a searchInput text view on the foreground. The textview enables interaction but texts alpha is set to 0 I didnt want to consume time with padding and insets relative to the various screen size and autolayout constraints I have. When typing, the changes are reflected on the searchLabel, and the suggestion based on inputs on the suggestionLabel.p  pstrongThe goalstrongp  pIts a visual goal. when the user select a place based on suggestion, the places profile fades in and its title is set at the exact same place than was the search text. all of this to serve a good looking transition.p  pstrongThe challengestrongp  pThe search input, label and places profile title have to be centered Im speaking about text alignment here. To make this work with the different layer of text, I used a set of auto layout constraints where blocks are centered in the views, with dynamic width, and an original text alignment set to .Leftp  pHaving the alignment set to .Center breaks the text layers perfect overlap. So, I though about keeping it this way and make the transition from .Left alignement to .Center when users validate their choices.p  pMy problem is that textAlignment doesnt seems to be something that we can smoothly animate. So I was wondering if there was a trick of some sort I could use p  pthanks you for any idea you could come up with.p  pIm not sure its relevant but here is the code wrotep  precodefunc textViewDidChangetextView UITextView  Handle the text changes here          displaySearch.text  textView.text         displaySearch.textAlignment  NSTextAlignment.Left         displaySearch.font  UIFontname searchView.font.fontName, size 23          if suggestView.text.rangeOfStringsearchView.text  nil             printlnexists                  else             suggestView.text                     USER INPUT         let scope  self.searchView.text          SCANNING SUGGESTION DICT         forvar i  0 i lt dict.count i             let stringon  dict[i][place] as String             printlnstringon              if let range  stringon.rangeOfStringscope.lowercaseString                  if range.startIndex  stringon.startIndex                      suggestView.text  stringon.capitalizedString                     searchView.text  searchView.text.capitalizedString                     suggestView.textAlignment  NSTextAlignment.Left                     suggestView.font  UIFontname searchView.font.fontName, size 23                     suggestView.textColor  UIColor.grayColor                                               func textViewtextView UITextView, shouldChangeTextInRange range NSRange, replacementText text String gt Bool          iftext  n              textView.resignFirstResponder             ANIMATE TEXT ALIGNMENT             return false                  return true      codepre

Positive 28649 pI am in a situation where I need to check if preferredMaxLayoutWidth is set to automatic. Im using a custom subclass of UILabel, and in that subclass, I am setting the preferredMaxLayoutWidth every time the user calls codelayoutSubviewscode or codeintrinsicContentSizecode. The issue occurs in just one of my views, on iOS 9 on an iPhone 5S or earlier, so its a very limited issue.p  pWhat happens is the text gets truncated instead of word wrapping. This seems to be fixed by setting the preferredMaxLayoutWidth to automatic in the storyboard, and removing the manual setting of it in the two methods before, however, this breaks other uses of this UILabel subclass across the app. So Id like to only set it if preferredMaxLayoutWidth is not set to automatic, otherwise Id like to skip over setting it.p  pIve searched and searched and havent found a good way to check if its set to automatic. Checking if preferedMaxLayoutWidth is equal to zero was my first and only thing Ive come across to try, and that didnt work.p  pId prefer to not subclass this subclass for just this one usecase, as this issue may pop up elsewhere across the app, it would be nice to be able to fix it by just setting this one property and having my custom subclass handle that change in properties.

Positive 28649 pIve run into a very hard to track down issue in my app. So, before iOS 9 I had a TableView that displayed a couple of multi line labels, these all still display on multiple lines, however, on an iPhone 5s or below, on iOS 9, these lines truncate instead of wrapping.p  pTo add yet another layer of complexity onto this, it only seems to happen in the first and last emmultilineem cells. Theres only ever three cells that this issue could affect, if cells 13 are all multiline, cells 1 and 3 will be truncated and cell 2 will be fine. If cells 1 and 2 are multi line but 3 is not, cells 1 and 2 will truncate and cell 3 will be fine obviously, single linep  pBasically, I am trying to setup a tableview with 3 cells, which are almost always multi line. However, the first and last cells do not show as multi line cells on an iPhone 5s or lower running iOS 9. If the user is still on iOS 8, the cells get laid out fine, or on an iPhone 6 or 6s.p  pDoes anyone know anything in the iOS 9 SDK that may have changed to cause this type of issue I suspect it is something to do with how UILabels get sized that changed, but I cant for the life of me figure out why it would only affect the first and last multiline cell in the table view.p  pId appreciate any help, or any ideas pointing towards anything at all that I could look into.p  pEdit More info Im using a custom UILabel that calls codesizeToFitcode every time the text is set. Whenever codelayoutSubviewscode or codeintrinsicContentSizecode is called, it sets the codenumberOfLinescode to 0. codepreferredMaxLayoutWidthcode is also set to be the width of the labels bounds in these methods, as well as anytime the bounds are set on the label.p  pAnother interesting point Whenever codedrawTextInRectcode is called, it chooses its height based off of the minimum of either the height returned by calling code[self sizeThatFirstrect.size]code on the CGRect given to the method, or the height of the numberOfLines  lineHeight, and this always returns a very consistent 53, for the multi or single line labels, so it is recognizing that it should be multiple lines, but for some reason, still truncates instead of word wrappingp

Debugging the view hierarchy shows me that for some reason, the UIView is displayed in front of the UILabel.p  pHow can I set the UILabel in front of the UIView I remember encountering the same problem in XCode 6 and was able to bring the UILabel to front but cant now find any advice on how to do this on XCode 7.p  pThanks in advancep

Positive 28649 pI have a game made with Unity, and combined it with iOS provided as library to provide some native features.p  pI use this a hrefhttpsgithub.comhaxporUnityNativePrototype relnofollowUnityNativePrototypea which I forked from original creator a hrefhttpsgithub.comsamizzo relnofollowsamizzoa. It works fine, but right after I tested it with iPad 2. Things seem to be not right.p  pA little bit of concept of integration between iOS and Unity is this.

Only 2. I use for quick testing because integrating a final app between Unity and iOS requires time.p  pI use size class to set font size for codeUILabelcodein Storyboard. I tested it with 2. and it works fine. But strongproblemstrong occurs whenever I test it with integrated app, codeUILabelcode sets back to use default font size I have set with size class AnyAny. It suddenly changes after I touch on the view. I even applied work around by subclassing codeUILabelcode then override codesetFontcode method to force setting a correct font size. It works but has a problem with layout later on in which no matter I call codelayoutIfNeededcode on the view, it doesnt look like. p  pThe following is debug log I print it out to see if theres a call to set new font to codeUILabelcode.

Positive 28649 pI have a custom UITableViewCell that contains a UILabel. Im using Auto Layout and have the constraints properly set up. p  pIm running into an issue where some of the UILabels are taller than they need to be while the table view is in edit mode there are no problems when the table view isnt in edit mode. Some sections in the table view are allowed to be reordered or deleted, and some are not. Ive noticed that emonlyem the cells that arent allowed to be removed or reordered are having this problem. I believe the UILabel is sizing its height based on its width if it were indented on the right to show the reorder control. p  pThere was actually more extra height in the problematic cells before, but I improved the situation by returning codetruecode in codetableViewtableView UITableView, shouldIndentWhileEditingRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath.code Of course, Id rather not indent the cells if I can avoid it. If I prevent any cells from being reordered, the problem disappears completely. p  pIve read many answers to other questions about improperly sizing UILabels that suggest to create a UILabel subclass and set the labels codepreferredMaxLayoutWidthcode property. Ive tried that and it doesnt seem to solve the problem. p  pI have changed the background color of the UILabel to make sure the problem really lies in the height of the label. The text appears to be centered vertically in the label.p  pIs there any way to only allow some cells to be indented while still having Auto Layout correctly calculate UILabel heightsp

Why does it suddenly take 350ms to deliver the same 5KB p  pPS. On both machines the results are obtained by accessing the URL via the actual machines hostname, e.g. a hrefhttpmachinenameapppage.aspx relnofollowhttpmachinenameapppage.aspxa as opposed to a hrefhttplocalhostapppage.aspx relnofollowhttplocalhostapppage.aspxa. p  pPPS. Configurationwise, the setups of a dev box and the server are as close as we could make them  both use the exact same web.config. Both hit the DB sql server with integrated auth, and, consequently, the app runs under a domain account. The app uses forms authentication, and does NOT impersonate i.e. it always runs under the same account. Now, the way this works on IIS5 is different from IIS6  on IIS5 the account is specified in  tag in the machine.config, and on IIS6 its the AppPool setting. The setup seems pretty typical for both environments, and I cant imagine it causing 350ms delays...p

Im using the boost ublas sparse matrices, specifically mappedmatrix, and there is an intermittent bug that occurs eventually, but not in the initial phases of the program.

Debugging with Eclipse, I can see that the program enters the boost mappedmatrix code and continues several levels down into stdmap, stdRbtree, and stdless.  Also, the program occasionally traces down to stdmap, stdRbtree, and stdSelect1st. While code is executing and the active line  whats in memory changes in Rbtree, execution never seems to return in the level of stdmap. The line in stdmap the program is stuck on is the return of the following function.p  precodeconstiterator findconst keytypeamp x const  return Mt.findx  codepre  pIt seems to me that there is some element in the c matrix that the program is looking for but somehow the underlying storage mechanism has misplaced it.

Negative 28649 pI have an application using JPA, Hibernate and ehcache, as well as Springs declarative transactions. The load on DB is rather high so everything is cached to speed things up, including collections. Now it is not a secret that collections are cached separately from the entities that own them so if I delete an entity that is an element of such cached collection, persist an entity that should be an element of one, or update an entity such that it travels from one collection to another, I gotta perform the eviction by hand.p  pSo I use a hibernate event listener which keeps track of entities being inserted, deleted or updated and saves that info for a transaction synchronization registered with Springs transaction manager to act upon.

Negative 28649 pIve implemented a server side application that records timestamps when records are created and updated. The app assumes that the server clock does not have daylight saving time enabled, a because Ive read this is best practise and b because I imagine it would be tricky if not impossible to handle the ambiguities that occur, e.g. when the clocks go back by an hour in October. p  pFor safety, if the app detects DST is enabled on startup, an error is logged and the app terminates. Im being petitioned by internal stakeholders to make the application work even if the app server clock has DST enabled.p  pI feel this is a foolhardy thing to try and do, but I need to convince management. Is it just that it makes implementation more tricky or is it fundamentally flawed in such a way that its impossible for such an app that records timestamps to function 100 correctly at all times of the year What is the best argument for not running such an app with DST enabledp  pThe best I have come up with isp  blockquoteWhen daylight saving time is enabled there are two time discontinuities per year. Consider the following scenario, where a server is running in the UK with clock set to local time with daylight saving enabled liAt 2am on Oct 25 2009 the clock goes back one hour to 1am. liA record is created at 1.30am liThe app which must store timestamps in UTC cant tell whether this is 1.30am before or after the clock has gone back, and therefore cant determine whether to include an extra hour in the adjustment to UTC. blockquote  pIs this true Is it actually possible to determine in a Java webapp whether an event that occurs at 1.30am on Oct 25 is before or after the clock adjustmentp  pAny better reasons for avoiding DSTp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pJust to be clear, its a given that the app must emstoreem times as UTC.

The different states reside in a lookup table. p  pItemState table        p  pid  namebr  1   Availablebr  2   Rentedbr  3   Brokenp  pAdding to this we have a business rule which states that whenever an item is returned, its state is changed from Rented to Available.br  This could be done with a an update statement like update Items set state1 where iditemid. In application code we might have an enum that maps to the ItemState ids. However, these contain hard coded values that could lead to maintenance issues later on. Say if a developer were to change the set of states but forgot to fix the related business logic layer...    p  pWhat good methods or alternate designs are there for dealing with this type of design issuesbr  Links to related articles are also appreciated in addition to direct answers.p

Negative 28649 pI recently upgraded from Vista32 to Win764.  On my old machine, everything was working fine.p  pUnfortunately, on my new machine NUnit wont load my unit tests, with the error message emSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly UnitTest or one of its dependencies.  The system cannot find the file specifiedem.  Actually, I had to go through all of my solutions projects and set them to 32bit to get this far.p  pSo I loaded up Dependency Walker, and it told me that I was missing strongIESHIMS.DLLstrong.  I found two on my machine, so I copied in the 32bit version from the Internet Explorer directory, and DW stopped complaining about that file.p  pHowever, its also missing strongGPSVC.DLLstrong.  I found only one copy of this in CWindowsSystem32, but when I copy that into my unit test directory, DW complains that its 64bit, and NUnit still wont run.  It also now adds strongSYSNTFY.DLLstrong to the missing list.  Ive only got one of those, and thats also 64bit.  NUnit still reports an error.p  pSo should I scrap this 64bit OS and go back to goodold 32bit, or am I missing something obviousp

Negative 28649 pI am using Syncfusions TreeViewAdv control. I attach a KeypUp event handler to it and it worked as expected. The event is fired whenever I released a key. However, once I wrap it in a ScrollViewer, the event is not fired. I have to move the event handler up to the ScrollViewer itself to catch the event. I aslo checked the PreviewKeyUp event, at the ScrollViewer it is fired and the Handled is false.

Negative 28649 pI need a documentation system for a PHP project and I wanted it to be able to integrate external documentation use cases, project scope etc. with the documentation generated from code comments. It seems that phpDocumentor has exactly the right feature set, but external documentation must be written in DocBook which is too complex for our team.p  pIf it were in python, sphinx would be just about perfect for this job ReST is definitely simpler than docbook. Is there any way I can integrate external ReST documentation with the docs extracted from phpdoc Should I just separate the external documentation eg. use ReST for external and phpdoc for internal Or do you have a better suggestion for managing the external documentationp

Negative 28649 pIm relatively new using OOP in PHP. Its helped immensely in the organization and maintenance of my code, but Id like to get better at designing my classes and using OOP as efficiently as I can. Ive read the Gang of Four Design Patterns book, but still need some help. After building a few small apps, heres one thing I keep running across.p  pLets say Im building an application that keeps track of enrollment information for a school.p  pThe way I would currently approach this is to have a class called codestudentcode, and methods within that class for CRUD on an individual students record. It seems logical that I would have a constructor method for this class that took the codestudentidcode as an argument, so I could reference it from within the object for all of those different CRUD operations.p  pBut then, as I continue building the app, I run across situations where I need to run queries that return multiple students. For instance, something like, codegetallstudentsfromgradegradecode, codegetdropdownofallstudentscode, etc. These methods dont apply to just one student, so it seems odd that I would have them as methods in my codestudentcode class, since I instantiated the object with one codestudentidcode in mind. Obviously I can make it work this way, but it seems like Im doing it wrong. What is the best way to approach thisp

Negative 28649 pIve made countless attempts to get this working, but everything I do gives me runtime errors. Ive been trying to make asset managers to manage content for my game engine, and Im using lua and luabind for my scripting. Getting everything to compile, binding classes and variables, and getting basic variables back from lua have been no problem so far.p  pMy problem is Im using an stdvector to store instances of my asset classes, and vectors dont seem to get along with luabind. I know I will need this vector because my C program will use it for rendering and other thingsp  pWhen I bind my manager class and the variables, including the vector containing my asset classes everything compiles and runs fine. In my lua script I can create new objects successfully, but when I try to access them, I get a runtime error.p  pTo sum everything upp  pI have a class that holds information for a game object or information about some other data.p  pI have another class that contains a vector of asset classes.p  pWhen I try to access this vector like I would a regular lua table, I get a runtime error.p  pSo what should I do in C and luabind that will allow me to modify the classes in my asset manager classp

Negative 28649 pThe product I have been working on has been in development for the past six years. It started as a generic data entry portal into an insanely complex part WPFpart legacy application. The system has been developed for all these years without a single Unit test in its fold. Now, the point has been raised for a comprehensive unit testing framework. I have been recruited recently to work on this product and have been tasked to get the Testing in order. Since the team that worked on the product for the last six years adopted Agile, the project lacks any documentation of the business rules or any design documents. p  pI have been trying to write unit tests for some of the modules. But I am not sure what to Mock, how to setup my Test fixture and eventually what to Test for, since a casual glance of the methods does not reveal its intentions. Also, it has come to my attention that the code was not developed with a particular methodology in mind. p  pGiven the situation, I was wondering if the good people of Stackoverflow could provide me with some advise on how to salvage this situation. I have heard about the book Working with Legacy Code that has something to say about this general situation but I was thinking about getting some pointers from individuals who have encountered similar situations within the technology stackC,VB,C,.NET 3.5,WCF,SQL Server 2005.p

Negative 28649 pI am doing the following.p  p1 I am exporting a database and saving it to a file called dump.sql. 2 The file is then transferred to a different server via PHP ftp. 3 When the file has been successfully transferred the administrator has an option to run a dbtransfer script on the new host. 4 This script blows up the script and runs the queries line by line.p  pThis works great  however there is a problem with foreign language encoding. We are using UTF8.p  pStep 1  This works fine, file is in UTF8 Format.  Step 3  When I test the contents of the dump.sql file using mbcheckencoding. The string comes back as UTF8.

Negative 28649 pI want to model a kind of FSMFinite State Machine. I have a sequence of states lets say, from StateA to StateZ. This sequence is called a Chain and is implemented internally as a List. I will add states by the order I want them to run.p  pMy purpose is to be able to make a sequence of actions in my computer for example, mouse clicks. I know this has been done a zillion times.p  pSo a state is defined as ap  ol licodeboolean Preconditioncode lt Checks to see if for this state, some condition is true. For example, if I want to click in the Record button of a program, in this method I would check if the programs process is running or not. If it is, go to the next state in the chain list, otherwise, go to what was defined as the fail state generally is the first state of them all.li licodeIState GetNextStatecode lt Returns the next state to evaluate. If Precondition was sucessful, it should yield the next state in the chain otherwise it should yield the fail state.li licodeRuncode Simply checks the codePreconditioncode and sets the internal data so codeGetNextStatecode works as expected.li ol  pSo, a naive approach to this would be something like thisp  precodeChain chain  new Chain chain.AddStatenew StatePrecondition, FailState, NextState lt Method structure chain.AddStatenew Statenew WinampIsOpenCondition, null, new ltproblem here, I want to referr to a state that still wasnt definedgt codepre  pThe big problem is that I want to make a reference to a State that at this point still wasnt defined.

Negative 28649 pIm working on a bit of JavaScript that interacts with a clientside SQLite database, via the newish codewindow.openDatabase...code, codedatabase.transaction...code and related APIs. As most of you know when you execute a query in this way it is an asynchronous call, which is typically good. You can make the call and handle the results as appropriate with callbacks.p  pIn my current situation Im working on an algo for a client that does some hierarchy walking in the locally stored database. The part of the algo Im having trouble with requires starting at some row, which has a reference to a parent by id that is another row further up in the table. I have to keep walking up this tree until I reach the root.p  pThe problem is that Im at a point where Im not sure how to use an asynchronous style query with a callback to keep feeding the loop parent ids. Ideally I could get the query to block so that I can do it all in the loop.

Negative 28649 pIn a typical clientservice application, where service is WCF, how to you use the service reference p  pFor example, do you instantiate service for each call separately, or do you open one and keep it through the lifetime of the client app when Im refering to instatiating service, I mean instantiate service object created by svcutilp  pFor now we used one service instance on client, because that seemed faster than always creating, opening and closing the service for each and every call, but now I wander if that was OK The main problem we have with this approach is that timeouts occur or we have to have sessions opened for 10hrs, connection breaks etc, and we always have to do IsAlive through the channel to make sure everything is fine...p  pIf its of any relevance the app is single threaded, and the authentication is custom built by inserting auth tokens into header. The binding is basicHttp or ws, doesnt really matter for this case.p

Negative 28649 pI have 3 columns that are resizable. When one is made wider, the one to its left is made smaller. Essentially there are only 2 handles. Left col and Mid col. So when Mid col is made thinner, Right col expands accordingly. All three of them are contained with a 900px parent div, so the sum of all three is always 900. They have max and min widths set statically.p  pMy issue is that if you take the left handle and move it all the way to the right youre still able to use the right handle and expand the mid col past the edge of the parent div.p  pI thought of a way to solve that issue by writing up a function that checks the widths of the columns and then subtracts left and right columns from the parent div width, I called it mWid. This leaves me with the number I want to set as the maxWidth for Mid col. p  pNow the issue is that mWid is not gettings updated for here maxWidth mWidp  pHere is what the function for the right handle looks likep  precodefunction      midResizable.resizable         handles e,         containment container,         maxWidth mWid,  gets set once, but doesnt update WHY         minWidth 195,         resize functionevent, ui              contWidth  container.width             newWidth  this.width             leftWidth  leftResizable.width             rightWidth  rightResizable.width             rightResizable.csswidth, contWidth15newWidthleftWidthpx             checkWid                           function checkWid      rightWidth  rightResizable.width     leftWidth  leftResizable.width     contWidth  container.width     mWid  contWidth15rightWidthleftWidth  codepre

Negative 28649 pI have an application that uses Remote SharedObjects and I am seeing some strange behaviour. I am writing an ActionScript application in AS3 using Flash Builder and connecting to Wowza Media Server 2. p  pMy application is working just fine but I am now trying to write unit tests for it using FlexUnit. My unit tests involve creating multiple connections to the same remote SharedObject and making sure that I am getting updates correctly. Everything seems to be working well except that I am not getting any of the SyncEvent.SYNC events with an info.code of delete. When I run my applications independently in separate tabs or even separate swfs embedded in the same page it works fine. For some reason though it does not work when inside a unit test. I have also found that if I load the swfs using a Loader inside the same SWF then I get the same behaviour. It seems to me to be something strange about the way multiples of the same SharedObject behave within the same SWF. I have had to work around other strange behaviour in the unit tests such as oldValues not being set properly in the onSync events too.p  pAnyone have any ideas how I can work around this Is this a known issue Am I crazy p  pWould appreciate any helpp

Negative 28649 pI am building an application for the android Phone and am experiencing some strange throttling. I believe it is because a semaphore is being called to halt whatever the application is doing to process something else within the phone. Though Im not positive.p  pI am curious of if there would be a way to spread these breaks out or something else to make it less visible to the users that the application is having little lag spikes sotospeak.p  pEdit some further information, what I am currently running with is a 2d array of images  only about 80 are drawn at a time of the instanced 8000. They only draw if their colour tint is not RGB0pitch black. A runtime loop in the update checks what images are closest to the player and gives them a basic minimal lighting of RGB 0.2f. Other than that basic event handlers and movementviewport loops are in the update. Note that Im using Libgdx framework, not android native. So OpenGL etc etcp  pEdit Id like to note that the problem isnt what youd think it would be. I was sending a vector2 about 3800 times a render  but not just sending one, but declaring new Vector2 and sending parameters that way. THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR WOULD NOT TOLERATE THIS ATROCITY. Runs smoothly now that Im sending just 2 floats. My bad ..p

Negative 28649 pI have two views that flip based on a button press within the view. The view has two CAGradientLayers as sublayers. If I flip immediately after the action method fires, the button is in the process of changing the opacity of the gradients and so you see stuttering the UIVIew flip animation is having to accommodate the button that is itself changing.p  pI can hack a solution by doing a performWithSelectionwithObjectafterDelay0.1f, but it feels like such a hack.

Negative 28649 pI dont know how to ask this so pardon me if I am unclear and please ask me to clarify. I want to center a page and have a side bar on the right within the centered content, not the right of the viewport. This is pretty simple except I want the element to be as tall as the viewport. However, if the body tag is taller, I want it to be as tall as the body tag. I need this because the sidebar has a background that must repeat along the yaxis to cover the entire viewport. I probably didnt explain anything so perhaps this jsFiddle will clear up any missed details.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdHerb relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdHerbap  pI can set the code.centercode style to have a position value of static which works but then the absolute positioning is thrown off. I could float the sidebar to the right but the height wont fill the page. I could use JavaScript, but JavaScript shouldnt be relied on for layout especially since the element that depends on it is a quarter of the pages content.p  pAny pointer will be much appreciated.p  pEDIT Changing the body and html tag to have a height of 100 helps but it still doesnt quite behave as I described. If there is content out of the viewport and you scroll to that content, the background wont repeat.p

Negative 28649 pwe are developing an JavaSE application which communicates to many clients via persistent tcpconnections. The client connects, performs somemany  operations which are updated to a SQLDatabase and closes the application  disconnects from server. Were using HibernateJPA and manage the EntityManagerlifecycle on our own, using a ThreadLocalvariable. Actually we create a new EntityManagerinstance on every clientrequest which works fine so far. Recently we profiled a bit and we found out that hibernate performs a SELECTquery to the DB before every UPDATEstatement. That is because our entities are in detachedstate and every new EntityManager attaches the entity to the persistence context first. This leads to a massive SQLoverhead when the server is under load because we have an writeheavy applicationand we try to eliminate that leak. p  ul liFirst, we thought about 2ndLevelCache. However, we discovered that hibernate invalidates its Query and CollectionCaches whenever a new item is added or removed. li liOn second thought, we evaluate whether to keep an EntityManager up as long as the client is logged in on the server. But I wonder if this is a best practice, because there are some drawbacks threadsafety, managingoverhead of the EntityManagerinstances, etc. li ul  pIn short we are looking for a way to get rid of those SELECTstatements before every UPDATE. Any ideas out therep

Negative 28649 pI want to compare the SURF descriptors in one image A, with the descriptors in several other images B,C,D,.. to find the most similar image to A. The descriptors have 64 dimensions.p  pUsing C and Emgu, the match is done by comparing As descriptors to Bs, then Cs, then Ds and so on. This is very slow when the image count exceed 10, because many irrelevant descriptors have to be searched.p  pTo speed up the process, the right way to go according to articles seem to be to build one kdtree for the descriptors in B,C,D,.. to quickly match find the descriptor in A. The kdtree is split in dimensions according to the level. First split is decided by 1st dimension, second split by 2nd dimension etc. However, at the number of dimensions are high for the descriptors 64, the benefit of using a KDtree becomes smaller.p  pSo my question is What experience or knowledge do you have with using a KDtreeother method to match SURF descriptors from one image A to several images B,C,D... What works well and not so well and have you done anything like thisp  pFLANN would be an option here, as it is used by OpenCV, but I cant find a version for C. Approximately Nearest Neightboor would also be an option to speed up the kdtree, but does that work well with matching imagesp  pBest regards Morten p

Negative 28649 pThis is my short description about my widget and main application. Sorry because of my English English is not my mother tonguep  pI have a music player widget. When this widget enabled, I need bind to a music player service A of main application. Because we cannot bind a service in AppWidgetProvider so I start a local service B in AppWidgetProvider and bind to that music player service A from here. Furthermore, I also have a service C to do widgets button function.p  pEverything seems to be working fine but when my main app with service A all forced stop they will be restating a moment later I must rebind to A from widget. Problem is when main app was forced stop, I cannot rebind to A because contextI stored Context as a global variable in AppWidgetProvider whenever I receive context from onEnabled, onUpdate is NULL.p  pMy question is how about my above widget structure Should service B stoped when bind to A done How can i bind to service A again when main app and service a was forced stop but they will automatically restart a moment later.p  pThanks youp

Negative 28649 pThe W3C maintain a a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgQATipsfontsizepage of advice on how to size your fonts in CSSa  last updated in April 2010. According to this page the very best way to style fonts is to use the absolute fontsizesp  blockquote   peven better, if a base fontsize is set for the document, use absolute size [ xxsmall  xsmall  small  medium  large  xlarge  xxlarge ] or relative size [ larger  smaller ] when defining the font size for a particular element within the document.p blockquote  pThe spec then a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS2fonts.htmlvaluedefabsolutesizedefines these fontsizesa in a table. As far as I understand this table, codesmallcode should be 23 code66code the size of codemediumcode, and codelargecode should be 43 code133code.p  pIf I test this out I get a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnottrobinm9aF91rather different resultsa from my interpretation of the ratios specified by the W3C. The results are consistent across latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and IE, but do not tally up with the W3C recommendation. codesmallcode is code81.25code instead of code66code, and codelargecode is code112.5code instead of code133code.p  pDoes this mean that modern browsers are not supporting these standards from the W3C Is there a new standard that superseded this one that Im not aware of Or have I misunderstood the meaning of that table from the W3Cp  pAt the end of the day my question comes down to Is it still the best practice to use absolute font sizes in CSS Will it behave consistently across browsers And ideally I would like to know what standard the modern browsers are following.p

Negative 28649 pIn some old Java code, I found a class that contains a lot of methods that all use the same error handling code trycatch with a lot of error handling, logging and so on.

Negative 28649 pSo Im having an iPad specific problem in Safari it also seems to happen sometimes on the iPhone, but either sporadically or its just not severe enough to notice.p  pBut I have a page with 5 audio players all html5 and they all start within a div with display none. Clicking on the title changes the display to be display block and the player pops up with an unfinished html 5 player. This works everywhere sans old IE of course and even works on the iPad.p  pHowever, when clicking on the title the entire page gets blurred out on the iPad. Ive tried playing with the code and it seems the problem is loading a div from none to block that has an html5 audio file within it. I even changed it so it only displayed the standard controller and I removed all of my extra code and the issue persisted.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on thisp  pThe link for the website is a hrefhttpartferretti.compaulperrysoundrecordings relnofollowhttpartferretti.compaulperrysoundrecordingsap  pheres a link to an image from the iPad a hrefhttpartferretti.comblurrediPad.png relnofollowhttpartferretti.comblurrediPad.pngap

Negative 28649 pI have a web site which makes frequent requests to an external web service, and Id like these calls to be async and parallel to avoid blocking and to speed up the site a bit. Basically, I have 8 widgets, each of which has to make its own web calls.p  pFor some reason, only the first 3 or so of them truly load async, and then the threads dont free up in time, and the rest of the widgets load sequencially. If i could get 3 of them to load in parallel, then 3 more in parallel, then 2 more in parallel, id be happy. So the issue is really that the threads arent freeing up in time.p  pIm guessing the answer has to do with some IIS configuration. Im testing on a nonserver OS, so maybe thats part of it.p  pEdit for jon skeetp  pIm using reflection to invoke the web calls like thisp  precodeoutput  methodInfo.Invokewebservice, parameters codepre  pThe widget actions which eventually call the web service are called via a jquery .each loop and the .load function maybe this causes a bottleneck. The widget actions are set up as async methods in an async controller.p  pHere is the code for one of the async methods they are all set up like thisp  precodepublic void MarketTradeWidgetAsync              AsyncManager.OutstandingOperations.Increment          a bunch of market trade logic           this eventually calls the web service         PlanUISetting uiSettingMarketQuotesConfig  WebSettingsProviderManager.Provider.GetMarketQuotesSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[Theme], SessionValuesltStringgt.GlobalPlanID, SessionValuesltStringgt.ParticipantID, MARKETQUOTES          AsyncManager.OutstandingOperations.Decrement         public ActionResult MarketTradeWidgetCompletedMarketTradeTool markettradetool              if Session.IsNewSession             return PartialView..ErrorAjaxSessionExpired         else                      ViewData[MarketData]  markettradetool             return PartialViewmarkettradetool               codepre  pAnd, like I said, these methods are called via jquery. My thinking is that since the action methods are async, they should give control back to the jquery after they get called, rightp

Negative 28649 pA continual sticking point for my team has been our Common library. Looking at related questions here, it might be more correct to say Framework.p  pThis currently consists of v1, v2, and v3. Where v3 is used for all new apps. It contains multiple WCF services, a class library with business objects, and a common web directory for jscssimages. p  pWe want to do things right as we go forward, especially since we have all actively begun contributing to the common library. Its turning into a big ball of mud, and deploying it is frightening for everyone. p  pOur first thoughts are to set up a test server that runs unit tests across all the code to make sure nothing breaks. The problem is that writing tests for everything is extremely tedious, and frankly no one has that kind of time. We are also all inexperienced with writing proper unit tests. With that said, well get it done if thats the best route to go. p  pAfter that, were not too sure. We see the common code as a place to apply continuous integration practices, since there are many varied applications we write that utilize it.p  pThis also introduces questions such as copying DLLs local, or having everything on one server somewhere. We are already feeling like were in DLL Hell, and want to get out. p  pWhat are strategies that good software shops use to manage a situation like this p  pAny and all advice is appreciated. If more information is needed, just ask. Ill be happy to provide it. p  pThanksp

Negative 28649 pIm using a public static object to handle user settings. The first view reads settings from Android database and creates the settings object. After this all my classes are able to use the settings.p  pHowever user may open another view and then kill the app. When the app is reopened the first view will not be created and the setting object will be null.p  pThere are some stuff that I have came up with but none seems very elegant to me.p  pNow I could just pass the settings object to all views but this will need to be repeated a lot and if the settings somehow change this would fail.p  pEach view could load the settings again. Probably the best solution but it generates a lot of seemingly stupid database connections and transactions.p  pThere is something called SharedPreferences which seems to be exactly for sharing preferences between views.

Negative 28649 pI cannot wrap my brain around the following thing ... and I hope theres an easy rubyist way to solve this.p  pI have a couple of linux servers that are all administrated through a bunch of ruby scripts with own config. All those scripts rely on a utils gem that is easily installed on all hosts with gem install.  The apps itself however are host dependend. p  pThe ruby script that for example handles nightly database backups makes only sense on the database host. And the script that parses application server log files has nothing to do on the database host, aso.p  pWith the utils gem it is easy. I just put it to our gem server and every host just fetches it. But the apps itself and their configs are copied over manually at the moment. But this is kind of stupid.  p  pId really like to just package the app  config into its own ruby gem. This part is easy. But I then want the appscript to be installed to usrlocalbin and the config files to go to usrlocaletc. But I cannot figure out how I could tell a gemspec how to handle install paths per file, including owner change and possible forced manuall diffautomatic merge in case the config has changed.p  pI secretly try to get a chefsystem started, which would solve all of the problems. But there are too many things going on here currently that prevent the setup of such an infrastructure ... I cannot even use sprinkle ... sadly. So its all pretty nasty at the moment.p  pSo is there a way of telling my gemspec how to handle certain files or at least a way I can tell the gemspec to run a certain file on install so I can code my way around those problemsp  pOr maybe youve got similar situations and have a nice solution that works for you and you dont mind sharing your wisdom with mep  pThx in advance, Stefanp

Negative 28649 pI have an MDX query referencing a SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition cube that from a functional standpoint returns the data that is needed accurately and correctly. It takes 510 minutes however to execute this query which is unaccaptable for our end users executing this query within an SSRS report.p  pThe query is listed belowp  precodeWith Member [Measures].[CurrentPaidAmount] as  Sum        Tailnonemptydescendants[Valuation Date].[DateHierachy].currentmember,4,[Measures].[SaleCount],1, [Measures].[CurrentTotalPaidAmt]        Member [Measures].[PreviousPeriodPaidAmount] as  Sum        Taildescendants[Valuation Date].[DateHierachy].currentmember.prevmember,4,1,       [Measures].[CurrentTotalPaidAmt]         Member [Measures].[YTDCurrentPaidAmount] as  [Measures].[CurrentPaidAmount]  [Measures].[PreviousPeriodPaidAmount]  select non empty       [Valuation Date].[DateHierachy].[Year], [Valuation Date].[Year].children,        [Valuation Date].[Month].[All], [DimLocation].[State].[All],        [DimSeller].[Store].children, [DimProduct].[ProductCode].children,        [DimProgram].[ProgramLine].children  on rows,   [Measures].[YTDCurrentPaidAmount] on columns  from      [CBSales] codepre  pThis underlying fact table stores the [total paid amount] measure in a cumulative fashion meaning on the last day of the month, the total dollars paid for a particular product since the beginning of time are calculated.  This would imply that at the end of each month, the months total paid dollars are added to the previous months amount in order to create a grand total of all paid dollars for the product in question since the beginning in time.p  pMy requirements are to calculate the total amount paid for each product solely for each individual year.p  pConsider the following sample dataset in which the month to date total paid dollars are listed for a particular productp  hr  p122010 Product A  25.00p  p112011  Product A 50.00p  p122011  Product A 100.00p  p12012    Product A 150.00p  p22012    Product A 160.00p  p32012    Product A 200.00p  hr  pIf I wanted to obtain the total dollars paid solely for the 2011 calendar year for Product A above, I would obtain the total calendar to date paid dollars for Product A as of 122010which is 25.00 and  subtract this amount from the total paid dollars valued as of 122011 which is 100.00.p  pSubtracting the 2 values yields a difference of 75.00p  p100.00  25.00  75.00p  pThis would indicate that a total of 75.00 was paid for Product A solely within the 2011 calendar year.p  pWith this said, getting back to the MDX query above, I have created 2 calculated members to perform this calculation. p  pMember 1p  p[Measures].[CurrentPaidAmount]p  pThis calculated member gets the last, non empty total dollars paid amount logged for the current calendar year in question based on the currentmember of the [Valuation Date].[DateHierachy].[Year] attribute. Being that for the current 2012 calendar year the last month to have total dollars logged is June 2012, the calculated member would need to be smart enough to identify that the [June] 2012 month member within the date hierarchy is the specific month the total paid dollars should be taken from.p  pIt is important that I return the [Year] attribute of the of the date dimension in question as they would like this member displayed within a tabular report.  p  pHence, I have included the following set within the calculated measure that will take the current year value based on what is returned back to the client within the resultset, and navigate down the date hierarchy until I get the last day within the calendar year in question that has a valid total paid amount as shown belowp  precodeTailnonemptydescendants[Valuation Date].[DateHierachy].currentmember,4,[Measures].[SaleCount],1, codepre  pMy reasoning was that if the user selects all years within the connected report, for each year this particular calculated member would obtain the last non empty total dollars paid amount for the calendar year in question and allow me to subtract that from the previous year to get the total paid dollars that were incurred solely within the calendar year in question.p  pNow, the complete MDX query I listed above does return the correct data when executed.  It takes forever to execute however taking more that 510 minutes to execute.

Negative 28649 pIve been practicing detours using the same approach as Microsoft Detours replace the first five bytes with a jmp and an address. More recently Ive been reading about detouring by modifying the virtual table. I would appreciate if someone could shed some light on the subject by mentioning a few pros and cons with this method compared to the one previously mentionedp  pId also like to ask about patched vtables and objects on the stack. Consider the following situationp  precode Class definition struct Foo   virtual void Callvoid  stdcout ltlt FooCalln     If its GCC, this is passed as the first parameter void MyCallFoo  object   stdcout ltlt MyCalln    In some function Foo  foo  new Foo  Allocated on the heap Foo foo2  Created on the stack   Arguments void  vtable, uint offset, void  replacement PatchVTablereinterpretcastltvoidgtfoo, 0, MyCall   Call the methods foogtCall  Outputs MyCall foo2.Call  Outputs FooCall codepre  pIn this case codefoogtCallcode would end up calling codeMyCallFoo  objectcode whilst codefoo2.Callcode call the original function i.e codeFooCallvoidcode method. This is because the compiler will try to decide any virtual calls during compile time if possible correct me if Im wrong. Does that mean it does not matter if you patch the virtual table or not, as long as you use objects on the stack not heap allocatedp

The user can type in a message, along with their name and some other data. Once they finish filling out the form they can submit it and it goes to my email and all is well.

Negative 28649 pAnother question for you Filemaker Pro experts. The database I am developing starts with a emMainem layout with a number of buttons e.g. insert new item, show all items, etc.. Each button is associated to a script, which takes the user to the relevant layout. In each of these layouts I show the buttons in a row, and highlight the current layout with inverse colour. My problem is that some of the buttons lead to the same layout, viewed in different modes, and I dont know how to conditionally highlight the right button. p  pFor instance, emInsert new itemem and emShow all itemsem take to the same layout, however in the first case the script views the layout as a form and inserts a new record, while in the second I view as a list and show all records. The layout is the same, though, so Id need to enact a conditional formatting based on something. How do I do that, and what should I check againstp  pThanks in advance for any help.p  pRegards.p

Negative 28649 pI have a somewhat general question regarding whats best when programming in PHP using also database connections. I am building a project which includes several modules and each module needs to connect to the MySQL sometimes. The module files are included in the main index.php depending on the action selected from the menu by the user. I guess, most projects work this way anyway.p  pSo far what I do is always open the connection at the start of each module file and close it after the queries have run.p  pMy question is this is it better to open the connection to the database in the beginning of the index.php and close it in the end so to have 1 connection open, or do multiple connections which stay open for less time Whats best for speed and overheadp

Negative 28649 pBasically, we have a branch call it B, it contains some branch specific code which needs to be merged with HEAD. The problem were having is that the branch was created long time ago. Since then, HEAD has been updated many times with lots of new features and many bugs have been fixed. The B branch still has most of the bugs already fixed in HEAD and it lacks some features. So, what needs doing is to take some features of branch B there are probably about 50 files that contain new functionality  I dont know exactly what these files are while leaving the rest of HEAD intact. p  pCurrently, the merge tool in Eclipse reports more than 1700 changes, doing automatic merge overwrites code in HEAD with that from the branch thus, introducing back bugs that have already been fixed. Is there a better way to tackle this instead of going through all the 1700 changes and manually merging them p

Negative 28649 pI have just recently started looking at applications of VBA in Excel accessing web pages through IE, and have no experience with html coding, so the solution to this might be really simple...p  pI have a section of code below that is supposed to navigate to a website, access a table and pull out the data into excel. However, at seemingly random times, for no reason that I can determine, the Object Variable TDelement becomes locked somehow, and Excel throws up an Error 70 Permission Denied when I try to access the next cell through the loop.

Additionally I would like to take advantage of the native performance over jQuery in this interaction.p

Negative 28649 pI have been working on a packet sniffer just for funeducation and its been going quite well. The problem that Im having is that the only packets appearing in coderecvfromcode are SENT packets i.e. packets with my IP as their source IP and not my WAN IP but my LAN IP if that makes sense. I tried fixing it and spent hours reading everything I could find but to me there seems no solution. I am 100 positive that the code Ive written does not detect all packets because wireshark detects way more ingoing and outgoing and its obvious that there is not only outgoing traffic from my PC.p  precodepacketsize  recvfromsniffer , Buffer , 65536 , 0 , SOCKADDR ampSenderAddr , ampSenderAddrSize  for int x  12 x lt 16 x       printfc ,Buffer[x]   stdcout ltlt n  iphdr  IPV4HDR Buffer  memsetampsource, 0, sizeofsource source.sinaddr.saddr  iphdrgtipsrcaddr stdcout ltlt inetntoasource.sinaddr ltlt nn codepre  pThats the point where it all goes down there is way more code but not important, the structures are all properly defined so there is no errors there else I couldnt be getting the same IP adress over and over in every single packet. Also there is another, nonexistent IP from my network showing up as source IP and very occasionally the source IP is 0.0.0.0 which I both find very weird.p  pBuffer is declared asp  precodechar Buffer  char malloc65536 codepre  pso its signed char and I have no idea how I could manually extract the separate parts of the header from these values.p  pI hope anyone can explain to me that recvfrom is actually not losing packets and that Im doing something wrong.

Negative 28649 pI actually saw this question come up once before on the site a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18006943nikeupdatedwebsiteandmyscriptisntworkingNike Updated website and my script isn39t workinga, but it closed cause the guy wasnt asking specific questions let me break it down for yall.p  pSo theres been a Chrome extension thats been floating around that automatically added specified sizes and quantities of whatever Nike shoe link you opened to your cart as soon as you visited the site. The coding is as followsp  precode    var sizeiwant  9.5     var howmany  1  function addToCart  var sizesListdocument.getElementsByNameskuAndSize[0] function setQuantity      document.getElementsByNameqty[0].selectedIndex  howmany1  function setSizeValue      for var i0 iltsizesList.length i         ifsizesList.options[i].text  sizeiwant              document.getElementsByNameskuAndSize[0].selectedIndex  i             setQuantity                ifsizesList  undefined      setSizeValue     document.getElementsByClassNamebuttoncontainer addtocart[0].click  else      setTimeoutaddToCart, 250   setTimeoutaddToCart, 250 codepre  pWhile Im not really a code guy, I can assume from looking at the code that skuAndSize is size and the variable you control is sizeiwant, etc, same goes for quantity with howmany, blah blah.p  pNow Nike recently updated the website, changing the layout and cart system, as well as changing up the way the size and quantity selection works. Now the code is inept. That is, it no longer does anything, but I cant identify what was added to the site to cause the code to become more useless than a chicken with a million dollars. From a few members on a forum I frequent who decided theyd rather be trivial than helpful, they mentioned that it only took a couple code lines to fix the code, and that the old code might not necessarily need editing. p  pSo I took a look at the site code, particularly the size and quantity selection portionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvXSGH.png altp  pIm pretty sure the culprit is skuID, but hey. Im not particularly bright. Im also totally devoid of coding knowledge. If its not too much trouble, could anyone shed some light, or at least give me a notsocryptic point in the correct directionp

Negative 28649 pI need to explore the topic of integer hashes for a specific application. I have a few requirementsp  ul liinteger to integer hashli lisemi reversibility.  I know a hash will not be 11 reversible, so please try to understand what I have in mind in terms of an n1 hash.  Lets say I have an original domain of numbers 0...n that I hash into a smaller domain 0...k. If I hash using function fn  k, then I want something reversible in the sense that I also have an inverse gk  n1,n2,n3, ..., nj are all the possible domain members that hash to kli lireasonably even and randomish distributionli lifor my inverse function g, I have a tight bound on the size of the set returned, and this size is roughly the same for any given kli lifast integer hashli ul  pTo explain the application a bit here...  I am operating in a very memory restricted environment.  I intend to not allow collisions. That is, if there is a collision with an existing value in the table, the insert operation just fails. Thats ok.  I dont need every insert to succeed. I am ready to make that trade off in favor of space and speed.  Now the key thing is this, when I store the value in the table I need to absolutely minimize the number of bits represented.  What I am hoping for is basicallyp  pIf I hash to value k, I can immediately narrow down what I store to a small subset of the original domain.  If the hash is semi  reversible and if I can enumerate all the possible domain elements hashing to k, then I can order them and assign the ordinal to each possibility.  Then I would like to store that much smaller ordinal rather than the original value which will require hopefully many fewer bits.  Then I should be able to fully reverse this by enumerating to the ith possibility for stored ordinal i. p  pThe importance of the tight bound on the size of he inverse set gk is because I need to know how many bits I need to allocate for each ordinal, and I want to keep things relatively simple by allocating the same number of bits to each table entry.  Yes.  I will probably be working on smaller than a byte values though. The original domain will be of a relatively small size to start with. p  pIm interested in any of your thoughts and any examples anyone might have reference to.  I think this should be doable, but I would like to get an idea of the range of possible solutions.  p  pThanks in advance Markp

I ran a stacktrace using gdb and located the problem to be the call to gtkwidgetendgl which is placed at the end of my drawing, realize and configure handler methods of course there is a gtkwidgetbegingl at the beginning of each of those as well.p  pHere is the relevant excerpt from the stacktracep  precode0  0xb1170b58 in gdkx11glcontextimplgetcurrent  at gdkglcontextx11.c514 1  0xb116c094 in gdkglcontextgetcurrent  at gdkglcontext.c244 2  0xb116c0b4 in gdkglcontextreleasecurrent  at gdkglcontext.c215 3  0xb4d04592 in gtkwidgetendgl widget0xa175608, doswap0 at gtkglwidget.c549 codepre  pand below is a minimal example of my realize method where the problem occurs where widget is an instance of Gtk.DrawingAreap  precodedef onrealizeself, widget, userdata     if not GtkGLExt.widgetbeginglwidget         return False     gl.glClearColorBACKGROUNDCOLOR[0],                     BACKGROUNDCOLOR[1],                     BACKGROUNDCOLOR[2],                     BACKGROUNDCOLOR[3]     GtkGLExt.widgetendglwidget, False   codepre  pSince I am pretty much clueless why this problem occurs sometimes around every 5th time a new widget is created I wonder if anyone ever has experienced the same or can reproduce the problem or help me to find a solution.p  pI need to say that I dont manually create an OpenGL context here since in the provided examples this never seemed necessary and I figured the widget would do this on its own. The stacktrace implies that there seems to be a problem getting the context. Whats startles me is the fact that this only happens sometimes. So if someone could even hint me how to tackle this problem I would be very glad as I am not an experienced C programmer.p

Negative 28649 pIve been modifying my Access DB to clean it up and make it more user friendly. As such, Ive been changing the names on form labels and controls to include lbl and Ctrl instead of the generic names Access assigned them. Previously, I had three separate forms ListingsForm, ListOffersForm, ListDetailsForm that I could access by using buttons to call the form. Since the forms were directly related to the primary form ListingsForm, I changed two of the forms into subforms. Now I keep getting errors when I try to add a record.p  pOn the ListingsForm form, there is a control field for Property Address AddressCtrl. This control uses a combo box that is linked to a separate table called Properties. If the property address is not listed in the drop down box, it used to bring up the PropertyForm form to input new properties. After, it requeried to get the new list with the new record. After making the subforms and changing control names, Im getting an error whenever I try to add a new property address.p  pRuntime error 2473p  pThe expression On Not in List you entered as the event property setting produced the following error.

Ive tried using a string for the file name and using the filename directly.

Negative 28649 pProgramming Language Delphi 6p  pSQL Server in The Back end.p  pProblemp  pApplication used to hit DB each time we needed something  , Ended up hitting it for more than 2000 times for getting certain things, Caused problems with  application being slow. This hitting DB happened for a lot of tables each having different structure and different number of columns. So Im trying to reduce the number of calls. We can have about 4000 records at a time from each table.p  pProposed Solutionp  pLets get all the data from DB at once and use it when we need it so we dont have to keep hitting the DB.p  pHow Solution is turning out so farp  pThis version of Delphi doesnt have a dictionary. So we already have an implementation of a dictionary from String List Let us assume that implementation is good.p  pSolution 1p  pStore this in a dictionary that we created with A  unique field as a key. And   Add rest of the data as strings in String List separated like this FiledName1FileValue,FieldName2FieldValue2,.. Might Have to create about 2000 String List to map data to key. I took a look at the following link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1799634howshouldiimplementahugebutsimpleindexedstringlistindelphiHow Should I Implement a Huge but Simple Indexed StringList in Delphia Looks like they could move to a different DB not possible with me.

Insertion of data will happened only once when we get all the data , per table as we require them.p  pNeed to only read the data , dont have to modify it.p  pConstantly need to search in terms of primary key.p  pIn addition to changing the application we have already done good  indexing on DB to take care of things from DB side.

Negative 28649 pUsing Node.js we are trying to come up with a way of generating a random number that falls between 1 and 100. However instead of using a standard linear distribution like the typical RAND function might we want to instead use a Weibull or some such distribution that will give a long tail and weigh the answers more heavily toward the larger values  for example a value of 75 to 100 might be generated 80 of the time, a value of 50 to 74 would be generated 15 of the time, and the remainder lt 20 generated 5 of the time.p  pWe have found a Weibul random variable function using the following formula  alphaln1X1beta. Assuming X is a standard linear random from 0 to 1, using alpha  1, and a beta lt 1 seems to give us a good distribution, however we are stumped as to how to generate a single value that will always fall between 1 and 100.p  pAny ideas or recommendations are appreciated. p

So simple with OpenCV C             Mat face  grayfacei              Resizing the face is necessary for Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces. You can easily              verify this, by reading through the face recognition tutorial coming with OpenCV.              Resizing IS NOT NEEDED for Local Binary Patterns Histograms, so preparing the              input data really depends on the algorithm used.                           I strongly encourage you to play around with the algorithms. See which work best              in your scenario, LBPH should always be a contender for robust face recognition.

Negative 28649 pI have a custom view width  2000 inside a Horizontal Scrollview width  480. So theres a region that is scrollable.p  pWhen codeonDrawcode is called, the dirty rectangle returned by codegetClipBoundscode returns the whole views dimensions, so I draw the whole view including the area that is not visible. As a consequence, when I scroll, codeonDrawcode is not called any more, because the areas that become visible were already drawn and somehow remembered.p  precodepublic void onDrawCanvas canvas      canvas.getClipBoundsr  returns 2000 x 400  codepre  pThis works finebr However my custom view can be as wide as 20,000 or more, and things start to get slow.

Negative 28649 pI am developing an application in java. With this application, I want to store data about students and payments so I decided to construct a database with MySQL.p  pI created a schema with two tablescodestudents,paymentscode.p  pThe codestudentscode table has many columns, one of which is called codestudentidcode and is the primary key. p  pThe codepaymentscode table has many columns one of which is called codepaymentidcodePrimary key and codestudentidcode which is a foreign key from the primary key of codestudentscode table. p  pI set the foreign key to codecascadecode on codeUpdatecode, so if i update a value in the codestudentidcode column in codestudentscode table the value will be updated automatically in the column codestudentidcode in codepaymentscode table. The problem is that when i change a value in a row at the codestudentidcode column in codestudentscode table I can see that the changes have been applied through a select querySELECT  FROM students in codestudentscode table. But when i execute a select querySELECT  FROM payments in  codepaymentscode table it seems that the changes have not been applied in the column codestudentsidcode. Please note that codeautocommitcode is enabled. Only when I commit the codeselectcode execution on codepaymentscode table will show the right resultsthe updated row.  p

Negative 28649 pI am new to C, and am wondering how to do the followingp  pI create an array whose size of the maximum number of elements I will need to storep  precodeint[] myArray  new int[64000] codepre  pI am passing this array to a 3rd party API.  In this API, they use the code.Lengthcode property to determine the number of elements.  I dont want this to happen because the array length is the maximum count, not the active count i.e. the number of elements in use.p  pWith this in mind, is there a way to create another array, whose size equals the active count  And, can this be done without a copy andor allocation  I already have the allocated memory  all I want to do is indicate the subregion of interest while playing nicely with the 3rd party API.p

Negative 28649 pIve got a CronJob scheduled to run every 7 minutes. The script runs a loop over a number of users and sends email via SMTP or does some API calls via curl. p  pThus, most of the execution time is apparently spent outside the realm tracked by codemaxexecutiontimecode on Linux. So, because I was experiencing hangs in my script that were always fixed by restarting it Im also looking for the cause of the hangs, but wasnt successful so far. p  pBecause with settimelimit set to 6 minutes, the script still ran 30 minutes sometimes, I now check codemicrotimetruecode after each round in the loop and break out of it, if it has been running more than 6 minutes.p  pStill, the script sometimes runs 37 minutes even though I can see that emails, which map to one round in a loop, still go off. p  pThe only trick I have left is a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions7493676detectingatimeoutforablockofcodeinphp74938387493838codepcntlforkcodea. I am reluctant to employ it because of platform dependence, and because I figured using a loop and codemicrotimetruecode should track time spent outside the process too and Id like to understand why this isnt the case here.p
Negative 28649 pIve been working on a server status checker script with PHP, JavaScript, XML, and XLST, and although Ive been getting closer, but am stumped by a new error. I get a xmlParseEntityRef no name error, which is generally caused by stray ampersands in an XML document. However, I have a grand total of zero ampersands in my XML document, so I have no idea what is causing the error. Another thing I found interesting is that if I remove the PHP filefetcher, and just parse the XML file locally, everything works fine. So that leads me to believe that theres something a bit off with my PHP code, but Im not sure what. The filefetcher retrieves and saves the data from the IP address successfully with an XML extension.p  pAny ideasp  pHeres a pastebin link to all the files with the script, since stackoverflow was throwing a fit with me trying to put it all in here a hrefhttppastebin.comNSB31P0f relnofollowhttppastebin.comNSB31P0fap
Negative 28649 pHey Guys I have succesfully made a GUI in java that will scale polygons and circles using a slider. Everything works but I was wondering if there is a way to change the Origin pointWhere it scales from. Right now it scales from the corner and I would like it to scale from the middle so I can start it in the middle and it scales out evenly. Also, If anyone could tell me an easy way to replace the Rectangle I have with an Image of some kind so you can scale the Picture up and down would be great Thank you Here is my codep  precodeimport javax.swing.   public class Fred      public static void mainString[] args               TheWindow w  new TheWindow         w.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE X wont close the window with out this line         w.setSize375,375         w.setVisibletrue          import java.awt. import javax.swing. import javax.swing.event.   public class TheWindow extends JFrame      private JSlider slider declare slider     private drawRect myPanel declare create panel       public TheWindow              superSlider Example make title         myPanel  new drawRect         myPanel.setBackgroundColor.green change background color          slider  new JSliderSwingConstants.VERTICAL, 0, 315, 10 restrains the slider from scaling square to 0300 pixels         slider.setMajorTickSpacing20 will set tick marks every 10 pixels         slider.setPaintTickstrue this actually paints the ticks on the screen          slider.addChangeListener                      new ChangeListener                              public void stateChangedChangeEvent e                                      myPanel.setDslider.getValue Wherever you set the slider, it will pass that value and that will paint on the screen                                                  addslider, BorderLayout.WEST similar to init method, adds slider and panel to GUI         addmyPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER                  import java.awt. import javax.swing.  public class drawRect extends JPanel       private int d  25 this determines the beginning length of the rect.       public void paintComponentGraphics gpaints circle on the screen              super.paintComponentg prepares graphic object for drawing         g.fillRect15,15, d, d paints rectangle on screen             x , y, width, height                       public void setDint newD              d  newD gt 0  newD  10 if number is less than zero it will use 10 for diametercompressed if statement         repaint            public Dimension getPrefferedSize               return new Dimension200, 200                public Dimension getMinimumSize              return getPrefferedSize        codepre

I extensively use POCO for several things, like sockets, file handling, logging, etc. So, I need to handle the exceptions POCO can throw.p  pApart from exceptions related with POCO, my code can throw other exceptions because several reasons basically, RunTime exceptions. POCO C actually contains a a hrefhttppocoproject.orgdocsPoco.RuntimeException.html relnofollowstrongRunTimeExceptionstronga class. So, I can use it.p  pMy question is strongShould I just rely on POCO exceptions, and allow third parties using my library to directly catch themstrong The other option would be to strongcreate my own set of exceptions, wrapping the POCO Exceptionsstrong, and expose them.

Negative 28649 pIm attempting to solve a domain modelling problem in a Rails application via composition.p  pI have a generic active record codeUsercode class which has some attributes in the codeuserscode table, but we have a few different flavours of user. Some of these different user types have data stored in different places for legacy reasons.p  pFor example codeBlueUsercode objects have their codeemailcode attribute stored in the codeDB.blueuserscode table, and codeRedUsercode objects have their email stored in codeDB.reduserscode. Note that codeblueuserscode and codereduserscode do not have the same table structure, they just both happen to have an codeemailcode. p  pMy intention is to have the generic codeUsercode class be the only to interact with, and use composition to create the codeUsercode objects out of their own properties and methods, in addition to the properties and methods of the composite object Lets call it the codeUserRecordcode object.p  pSo the codeUsercode class would have its own methods, but then at runtime as the codeUsercode is being instantiated perhaps via codeafterinitializecode, a codeRedUsercode or codeBlueUsercode object may be instantiated within codeUsercode as the codeUserRecordcode object. Each of the codeUserRecordcode objectsimplementations would be Active Record models themselves. Im then hoping that something can be done so if I ask for the property codeUser.emailcode, it can be pulled from the codeUserRecordcode object without having to call it like codeUser.record.emailcode. p  pIve looked a little bit at codecomposedofcode in Rails, but am unsure how I might go about unifying the properties  methods of the two objects so that I wouldnt have to do codeUser.record.emailcode elsewhere in the codebase.p  pI hope my explanation is clear, but if not Id be happy to take another stab at it.p

Negative 28649 pI am trying to implement a parallel calculation of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVariance relnofollowvariancea in JavaScript using MapReduce. I believe that this a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAlgorithmsforcalculatingvarianceParallelalgorithm relnofollowParallel algorithma could be used, but I cannott figure out how to apply it to an arbitrary number of datasets. So far, I came to the conclusion that the best way to approach the problem is to do a reduction based on the sum of squares instead of doing it against the variance. A naive implementation would look like thatp  precode partials is an array of [count, sum, sumsquare] arrays function variancepartials    var count  0   var sum  0   var sumsquare  0   for var i  0 i lt partials.length i      count  partials[i][0]     sum  partials[i][1]     sumsquare  partials[i][2]      return sumsquare  count  Math.powsum  count, 2    variance[[3, 6, 14], [3, 15, 77], [3, 24, 194]] should return 6.666666666666668 codepre  pNot being a statistician, I have a hard time figuring out whether such a parallel algorithm would introduce too many compounding errors. But if it is acceptable, it is worth noting that the variance does not need to be computed during the codemapcode phase. Only the sum of squares, sum, and count are needed.p

I add to the codePushpinscode collection 1000 codePushpinViewModelcode elements. They are rendered, memory is allocated, everythings fine. Now I want to clear the collection, and add another different in real scenario 1000 elements. So, I call codeClearcode method. But.. nothing happens codePushpinscode gets cleared, but codePushpinViewModelcodes finalizers are not called Then I add 1000 elements again, and my memory usage doubles.  You can guess what happens next. When I repeat this codeClearcode  codeAddcode procedure 35 times my app crashes.p  pSo, what is the problem Clearly codeObservableCollectioncode is holding references to the codePushpinViewModelcode objects after codeClearcode has been performed on it, so they cannot be garbage collected. Of course forcing GC to perform garbage collection does not help it sometimes even makes the situation worse.p  pIts bothering me for 2 days now, I have tried many different scenarios to try and overcome this problem, but to be honest, nothing helped. There was only one thing worth nothing  I dont remember the exact scenario, but when I had assigned codePushpins  nullcode, and then did something more, codeVehiceViewModelcodes were destroyed. But that does not work for me, because I also remember that I had problem with visualizing these pins on the map after the codeClearcode.p  pDo you have any ideas what can cause this memory leak How can I force codeOCcodes members to destroy Maybe there is some kind of alternative for codeOCcode  Thanks in advance for any helpp  pEDITp  pI did some tests with XAML Map Control  a hrefhttpsxamlmapcontrol.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpsxamlmapcontrol.codeplex.coma, and results are surprising. Overall map performance with 1000 elements added to it, is poorer than a native codeMapControlcode, BUT, if I call codeAddcode x1000, then codeClearcode, then codeAddcode x1000, the codePushpinViewModelcodes finalizers are geting called Memory gets freed, and app does not crash. So there is definitely something wrong with Microsofts codeMapControlcode... p

Negative 28649 pIm working through Zed Shaws Learn C The Hard Way and had a question regarding exercise 19 description and link below.  p  pThe skinny while readingentering the code, it struck me that we never explicitly free the memory which we malloc when creating the various objects more detail below at the start of program execution.  Its confirmed by valgrind valgrind reports that 12 blocks or 608 bytes are allocated at the start of execution these blocks are reported as lost most are indirectly lost and some is directly lost at program termination.  p  pSo...is this code representative of good or even acceptable memory management techniques  Or is the lack of memory deallocation a bug  Seems to be the latter but wanted to get others opinions since Im a C n00b.p  pGiven that none of the accompanying exercises involve changing the program to ensure we do free the malloced memory, I assume that the posted code is intended to be sound, i.e., representative of good coding practices...p  pIm including an overview of the exercise below.  Rather than repost the code in full, Im including the link a hrefhttpc.learncodethehardway.orgbookex19.html relnofollowhttpc.learncodethehardway.orgbookex19.htmla.p  pMods sorry if it isnt kosher to link to external sites, please lmk and Ill take it down, I just didnt want to reproduce the material posted on his site due to potential copyright issues.p  hr  pOverview of exercisep  pThe exercise is to make a simple textbased RPG in which the user can i choose to move from room to room i.e., from any room, you can choose to go northsoutheastwest or some subset thereof and ii choose to attack a monster who is in one of the rooms.  A quick summary of the implementation focusing on the relevant parts is as followsp  ol liWe define a typestruct Object in the object.h and object.c files on the linked page, within which we include among other functions a constructor which calls malloc and a destructor probably not the technical term which calls free.  li liIn the ex19.h file, we go on to define the following typesstructs Map, Room and Monster, each of which includes an Object i.e., what wed defined in object.h and object.c as well as some other stuff.li liGameflow is defined in the ex19.c file.  Its in this file that we     create instances of a Map, a Monster and a couple of Rooms.li ol  pAs you can see, we never call a function to deallocate the memory neither free nor the Objectdestroy function which we declaredefine in object.hobject.c for the Map, Monster and Room objects.  p  hr  pNote the Valgrind output below is the result of code which I copypasted from the site I made sure not to use my retyped versions of the files so as not to introduce errors.p  pValgrind outputp  precode10184  10184 HEAP SUMMARY 10184     in use at exit 608 bytes in 12 blocks 10184   total heap usage 12 allocs, 0 frees, 608 bytes allocated 10184  10184 608 64 direct, 544 indirect bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 12 of 12 10184    at 0x4C2C934 calloc vgreplacemalloc.c623 10184    by 0x400FCF Objectnew object.c52 10184    by 0x400E53 main ex19.c206 10184  10184 LEAK SUMMARY 10184    definitely lost 64 bytes in 1 blocks 10184    indirectly lost 544 bytes in 11 blocks 10184      possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 10184    still reachable 0 bytes in 0 blocks 10184         suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 10184  10184 For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with v 10184 ERROR SUMMARY 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 0 from 0 codepre

I would have though that the rendering just differs and this results in irregular different pixel values.p  pSo my question if I do this comparison, can I derive any rules from that Does anyone know the rounding rules of firefox Or will I have to make a emtolerantem comparison where I check whether the values are more than 1 unit apart from each other p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIf you quickly want to check this yourself, just go to a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma as this has a quite tiny DOM and entercodedocument.getElementsByTagNamebody[0].getBoundingClientRectcode in the javascript console on firefox and chrome. Y, height and top values are insanely long float values in firefox, whereas in they are shorter and strangely rounded in chrome.p

Negative 28649 pMy question is predicated on Jason Clarks statement at f8 2014 that app links is designed to sit side by side well with deep linking technologies. I have a word game app published in 2013 to Canada and Australia using Facebooks authentication but without deep linking.  For the US market launch my intent was to add Facebook deep linking. Managed with the request and feed dialogs to send the Match Identifier UUID for both initiating a match and then bragging about the match FriendSmash example at that time to open the game on that match. My day job got in the way and I did not have time to finish QA and support a launch to the US. Last summer I upgraded SDKs Facebook 3.14 and the url query no longer contained the string notif to allow me to parse for the match Id. Therefore, I switched from using [FBSession.activeSession handleOpenURLurl] to the current [FBAppCall handleOpenURLurl ] and some other code from the new FriendSmash example. However, the url passed from the Facebook app no longer contains the ref and therefore not the notif which was the method documented to utilize my deep linking content.

I probably would have given up a long time ago but I did once have deep linking working SDK 3.5.  I am wondering if I should be at another release level of the SDK for deep linking. It seems like the Facebook platform has significantly changed how it packages appLinkData. And although Facebooks documentation has improved over the past two years, many of the examples which are required to put this all together do not seem to be referring to the same level of SDK.  So Facebook how do I inject content into appLinkData so I can support deep linking with SDK 3.21 I thought about adding the Bolts framework but Jason implied it was designed for outlinking apps, which is not my case.p  pI can directly type in my iPhone Safari something like ruleofwordsmatchIdUUID and get the app delegate to parse out the [url query] so I could probably implement deep linking with push notifications, but I still like the ability to have a Facebook user tap on a link and launch the specific match directly.p

Negative 28649 pI need to create a graph to display userentered sleep data. The user will enter a start datetime and end datetime, as well as a numeric value for quality.

The x axis must be the dates that the sleep occurred like such Jan 01, 2015  Jan 02, 2015 that is the tick label for one pointsee fiddle for clarification. Lastly, the point will be colorcoded based on the sleep quality value.

It is on the right track of what I need but as you can see, there are a few issues 1. The datalogic has been rigged to work for the fiddle but it will prove more difficult when working with actual datetimes. 2. Is columnrange the correct graph type to achieve what I want here 3. How can I get the tooltip formatted with the sleep quality value and the datetime range I tried adding explicit categories but that messed up the x axis. [Tick labels disappeared] 4. Points arent directly aligned with x axis tick marks tooltips are also misalignedp  pIt seems that when I try to add one feature then another begins to malfunction.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXBmB559 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netXBmB559ap  pAny guidance with this graph would be greatly appreciated.p

According to the JBoss logs and admin console the slave has successfully connected to the master. However, if I put something in the session on the slave, take the slave offline, the master cannot read the item that the slave put in the session.p  pThis is where I need some help with the general setup. Do I have to have a separate apache httpd instance sat in front of JBoss to do the load balancing I thought there was a load balancing capability built into JBoss that wouldnt need the separate server, or am I just completely wrong If I dont need apache, please could you point me in the direction of instructions to setup the JBoss load balancingp  pThanks.p

Negative 28649 pI came across a very unusual error with VBA that Im struggling with for two days now. I have a code that updates values to be shown in an Activex dropdown list and then assigns them to the list using the codeListFillRangecode property. Unfortunately every time I run it it generates an error. I presume the error is caused by running a piece of code on a power pivot that Im refreshing before it completes the refresh. The error occurs in the 9th line of the lastRow function which selects a cell in the power pivot. The error no longer appears after I comment out the 5th line of the codeSubcode which refreshes the pivot table. I guess the solution to this problem is forcing VBA to wait with going to the next step of the code until the refresh of the table is completed. I tried solving this problem by adding codeDoEventscode and some other techniques that Ive found online, but none of them worked. Any suggestions on tackling this problem would be highly appreciated.

Negative 28649 pIn my controller, I have something like the followingp  precodepublic function index      questions  Questionall      return viewquestions.index, compactquestions  codepre  pHowever, I would like this route to also be used by my ajax requests.

Im considering the followingp  precodepublic function index      questions  Questionall      return thisgtrenderquestions.index, compactquestions   public function renderparams      if thisgtisAjax          return Responsejsonparams      else          return viewquestions.indexgtwithparams       codepre  p..by the way, I havent tested any of this yet, but hopefully you get the idea. p  pHowever, I was wondering if I can alter the built in view... functionality itself to keep things even lighter. So I just keep the followingp  precodepublic function index      questions  Questionall       this function will detect the request and deal with it      e.g. if header XRequestedWithXMLHttpRequest isAjax     return viewquestions.index, compactquestions  codepre  pIs this possiblep

I am pretty terrible with css, so if someone has a way to accomplish this with multiple classes then I can certainly make edits.p  precodeltheadgt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefmain.cssgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript languageJavaScriptgt function checkCheckBoxestheForm      if      theForm.m.checked  false ampamp     theForm.t.checked  false ampamp     theForm.w.checked  false ampamp     theForm.th.checked  false ampamp     theForm.f.checked  false ampamp     theForm.s.checked  false ampamp     theForm.sn.checked  false ampamp               alert You didnt choose a day         return false      else              return true       ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv classbox titleSchedulegt    ltdiv classwrappergt     lta datapopupOn demand hrefrefresh valueRefresh NowgtRefresh Nowltagt    ltdivgt     lta hrefschedule valueChange SchedulegtChange Scheduleltagt ltdivgt  ltaside classmodal idschedulegt lth2 gtRefresh Schedulelth2gt      ltsection gt          ltdiv classonoffswitchgt              ltform nameonoff methodpost action urlfortogglebool gt                  ltinput typecheckbox nameonoffswitch classonoffswitchcheckbox idonoffswitch onchangethis.form.submit  checkval gt                  ltlabel classonoffswitchlabel foronoffswitchgt                     ltspan classonoffswitchinnergtltspangt                     ltspan classonoffswitchswitchgtltspangt                  ltlabelgt              ltformgt          ltdivgt ltp idschedulemssggtltstronggtWhen should this occurltstronggtltpgt      ltform methodPOST namescheduletime action urlforinfo  onsubmitreturn checkCheckBoxesthisgt         ltselect classcustomdropdown namehour idhour requiredgt             ltoption value selected disabledgtHourltoptiongt              for i in hours              ltoption value i gt i ltoptiongt              endfor          ltselectgt         ltselect classcustomdropdown nameminute idminute requiredgt             ltoption value selected disabledgtMinuteltoptiongt              for i in minutes              ltoption value i gt i ltoptiongt              endfor          ltselectgt         ltselect classcustomdropdown nameperiod idperiod requiredgt             ltoption value selected disabledgtAMPMltoptiongt             ltoptiongtAMltoptiongt             ltoptiongtPMltoptiongt             ltselectgt   ltActions, at least one must be checkedgt             ltinput typecheckbox nameaction idcode classcsscheckbox valuecode checkedgtltlabel forcode classcsslabelgtCodeltlabelgt         ltinput typecheckbox nameaction iddatabase classcsscheckbox valuedatabase checkedgtltlabel fordatabase classcsslabelgtDatabaseltlabelgt             ltdiv idscheduleformgt   gt ltDays, at least one must be checked in addition to at least one actiongt              ltinput typecheckbox namem idm classcsscheckbox value1 checkedgtltlabel form classcsslabelgtMonltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox namet idt classcsscheckbox value2 checkedgtltlabel fort classcsslabelgtTuesltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox namew idw classcsscheckbox value3 checkedgtltlabel forw classcsslabelgtWedltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox nameth idth classcsscheckbox value4 checkedgtltlabel forth classcsslabelgtThurltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox namef idf classcsscheckbox value5 checkedgtltlabel forf classcsslabelgtFriltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox names ids classcsscheckbox value6 checkedgtltlabel fors classcsslabelgtSatltlabelgt             ltinput typecheckbox namesn idsn classcsscheckbox value7 checkedgtltlabel forsn classcsslabelgtSunltlabelgt                 ltfieldsetgt             ltdivgt             ltinput typesubmit nameschedsub idschedulesub valueSave Changes gt              lta href classbtngtCloseltagt         ltformgt              ltsectiongt             ltfooter classcfgt         ltfootergt     ltsectiongt           ltasidegt         ltbodygt codepre  pstrongCSS for checkboxesstrongp  precode Begin Checkboxes  input[typecheckbox].csscheckbox      positionabsolute      zindex1000      left1000px      overflow hidden      clip rect0 0 0 0      height1px      width1px      margin1px      padding0      border0  input[typecheckbox].csscheckbox  label.csslabel          paddingleft 27px     height 22px     display inlineblock     lineheight 22px     backgroundrepeat norepeat     backgroundposition 0px 0px     fontsize 120     margin 20px     verticalalign middle     cursor pointer     fontfamily Open Sans, sansserif   input[typecheckbox].csscheckboxchecked  label.csslabel  backgroundposition 0 22px   label.csslabel      backgroundimageurlhttpcsscheckbox.comcheckboxesucsscheckboxcc5c7a8c1727e75f2de9c422739d0ad5.png     webkittouchcallout none     webkituserselect none     khtmluserselect none     mozuserselect none     msuserselect none     userselect none                End Checkboxes   codepre

Any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated.  p  pHere is the result of the header in the MS Word doc I want to create...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhFgeS.png altenter image description herep  pHere is my XSL for the header...p  precodeltxslstylesheet xmlnsamlhttpschemas.microsoft.comaml2001core      xmlnsdtuuidC2F4101065B311d1A29F00AA00C14882      xmlnsfohttpwww.w3.org1999XSLFormat      xmlnskmfhttpwww.kleinmundo.comfunctions      xmlnsournschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice      xmlnsslhttpschemas.microsoft.comschemaLibrary2003core      xmlnstlrhttpwww.elite.comfunctions      xmlnsst1urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficesmarttags      xmlnsvurnschemasmicrosoftcomvml      xmlnswhttpschemas.microsoft.comofficeword2003wordml      xmlnsw10urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeword      xmlnswsphttpschemas.microsoft.comofficeword2003wordmlsp2      xmlnswxhttpschemas.microsoft.comofficeword2003auxHint      xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransform version2.0gt      ltxsltemplate nameXSHeader xmlspacedefaultgt         ltxslvariable nameTW select1440 gt         ltxslvariable nameimagedir selectImages gt         ltwsectPrgt             ltwhdr wtypefirstgt                 ltwtblgt                     ltxslvariable nameCol1 select2  TW gt                     ltxslvariable nameCol2 select5.5  TW gt                     ltwtblPrgt                         ltwtblW ww0 wtypedxagt                         ltwtblCellMargt                             ltwleft ww0 wtypedxagt                             ltwright ww0 wtypedxagt                         ltwtblCellMargt                     ltwtblPrgt                     ltwtblGridgt                         ltwgridCol wwCol1gt                         ltwgridCol wwCol2gt                     ltwtblGridgt                     ltwtrgt                         ltwtrPrgt                             ltwcantSplitgt                             ltwtblHeadergt                         ltwtrPrgt                         ltLOGO COLUMN gt                         ltwtcgt                             ltwtcPrgt                                 ltwtcW wwCol1 wtypedxagt                                 ltwvAlign wvalbottomgt                             ltwtcPrgt                             ltwpgt                                 ltwpPrgt                                     ltwkeepNextgt                                     ltwkeepLinesgt                                 ltwpPrgt                                 ltwrgt                                     ltwtgtLOGO HEREltwtgt                                 ltwrgt                             ltwpgt                         ltwtcgt                         lt ADDRESS INFO COLUMN gt                         ltwtcgt                             ltwtcPrgt                                 ltwtcW wwCol2 wtypedxagt                                 ltwvAlign wvalbottomgt                             ltwtcPrgt                             ltwpgt                                 ltwpPrgt                                     ltwkeepNextgt                                     ltwkeepLinesgt                                     ltwjc wvalright gt                                 ltwpPrgt                                 ltwrgt                                     ltwrPrgt                                         ltwsz wval16 gt                                     ltwrPrgt                                     ltwtgtCompany Address    City, State  ZIP    TEL 555.555.1234    FAX 555.555.4321ltwtgt                                 ltwrgt                             ltwpgt                         ltwtcgt                     ltwtrgt                 ltwtblgt                 ltwsectPrgt                     ltwpgSz ww12240 wh15840 worientportrait wcode1 gt                     ltwpgMar wtop720 wright720 wbottom720 wleft720 wheader720 wfooter720 wgutter0 gt                     ltwcols wspace720 gt                     ltwtitlePg gt                     ltwdocGrid wlinepitch272 gt                 ltwsectPrgt             ltwhdrgt             ltwtitlePg gt             ltwhdr wtypeoddgt             ltwhdrgt             ltwftr wtypefirstgt                 ltwpgt                     ltwrgt                         ltwt gt                     ltwrgt                 ltwpgt             ltwftrgt             ltwtitlePg gt             ltwftr wtypeoddgt                 ltwpgt                     ltwrgt                         ltwt gt                     ltwrgt                 ltwpgt             ltwftrgt             ltwpgNumType wstart1 gt             ltwcols wspace720 gt         ltwsectPrgt     ltxsltemplategt ltxslstylesheetgt codepre  pNickp
Negative 28649 pSo, similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11017678sqlservercompareresultsoftwoqueriesthatshouldbeidenticalSQL Server compare results of two queries that should be identicala, I need to compare the output of two stored procedures to ensure the new version is generating equivalent output to the old version. The tricky part is that my SP outputs six tables of differing widths.p  pI started writing a hybrid version of them that would compare each of the tables individually, but its a pretty complex SP, so I was hoping there was an easier way.p  pI tried using EXCEPT as in the linked question, but it looks like that will only compare one table to one other table.p

Negative 28649 pI am trying to develop an alarm system in android that would function after the application closes, making multiple simultaneous alarms possible which should be repeatable and cancelable, but I have read documentation for such functions.p  pCurrently, I only have the UI which fires off intents to receiver at scheduled times through AlarmManager and the Receiver class which extends BroadCastReceiver. Although the alarm somehow functions, there have been issues like the alarm not sounding at appropriate times until I open app again and not providing the correct alarm.p  pI have read that a service is commonly used in such apps to provide functionality of the application when the activity is closed. Thus, I am interested in what a service would provide in the context of the application, and whether my problems are solvable through service. p  pI have searched answers and read that a service is useful for running background operations i.e. mp3 or alarm  For example, google states that Another application component can start a service and it will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. . The following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9208576howtodevelopandroidalarmapplicationanswera states that to use alarm simultaneously you must use Service class for that.p  pTherefore, I think that a service may be useful for providing the functionality for the alarm. However, some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16158086androiddeveloperalarmmanagervsservicepeoplea seem to represent a service as a either or with AlarmManager, which I am currently using. Most others seem to use AlarmManger to start service or perform an action of that nature. I would be very grateful if someone could shed light on what a service provides Ive already read googles explanation but it did not clear up whether I need it or not.

Negative 28649 pSo Im new to Ruby and Im looking to make my code a little neater and cleaner looking. Basically I have a these methods in a class. I made a reverse polish notation calculator. Now I know in theory dont repeat yourself but as you can see in the codepluscode codeminuscode codedividecode and codetimescode methods I do. Basically the only thing that changes is a the , , , . Im wondering what is the best way to go about fixing that To start, heres the code. Some of my thoughts are below.p  precodeclass RPNCalculator  def initialize     calculator   [ ]  end  def pushnum     calculator ltlt num end  def plus     value  calculator[2].tof  calculator[1]     calculator.deleteat2     calculator.deleteat1     calculator ltlt value end  def minus     value  calculator[2].tof  calculator[1]     calculator.deleteat2     calculator.deleteat1     calculator ltlt value end  def divide     value  calculator[2].tof  calculator[1]     calculator.deleteat2     calculator.deleteat1     calculator ltlt value end   def times     value  calculator[2].tof  calculator[1]     calculator.deleteat2     calculator.deleteat1     calculator ltlt value end codepre  pBasically, Im thinking to make another method codeendcalccode which takes a block. Im wondering what that would look like. For example this is what I was thinking about.  p  precodedef endcalcampblock value  calculator[2].tof ampblock calculator[1]     calculator.deleteat2     calculator.deleteat1     calculator ltlt value end  def plus   endcalc end codepre  pBasically in the methods codepluscode codeminuscode etc, I just call endcalc plus the necessary codecode codecode codecode codecode sign. How can I write it syntactically so that the codecode method is inserted into codeendcalccode Or what should I go about studying in order to understand how to do that Is there another what to do it that may be more effective that I do not know about yetp

Negative 28649 pIm working on a program for a Java assignment where I need to use recursion to populate a Pascals Triangle and then print a given line of triangle.p  pEverything compiles fine but Im having issues with ArrayIndexOutOfBound exception though. p  pThe stack trace to main line 30 in pTTest class goes from line 80, 87, 92 of pasTriangle in the populateT method. So obviously somethings wrong here. Anyone know whats wrong here Please see my code below p  precode  pasTriangleTest.java     Tests the pasTriangle class by creating a few Pascals Triangles of different size as pasTriangle objects. Then calls the getLine method of pasTriangle class to print some of the lines  of the triangles. Tests include printing lines in the triangle, as well as trying to print the first line and nonexistent lines of some triangles.  Anticipated exception ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception, occurring if line row outside of array is attempted to be accesed, is handled.       public class pTTest         public static void main String [] args                 pasTriangle T1  new pasTriangle1         pasTriangle T2  new pasTriangle9         pasTriangle T3  new pasTriangle3         pasTriangle T4  new pasTriangle5            Triangle with only one line created so not a triangle test for condition size  1.

Note the number of numbers on each line is the same as the number of lines in             the triangle, so size can be used for both values.

Note case where size  1, recursion does not occur since only 1 integer can be added             to array.             Also note base case where base of triangle is reached and recursion stops.             Also note cases for first and last value of each line row.

Negative 28649 pSo I am able to make the first JSONP request to the yelp API work to return business data for me, but any subsequent requests I make lead to the callback for failure that logs a status code of 404. Yet when I pull up the network tab in Chrome Dev Tools I see that all the subsequent GET requests I made all have status 200 and I do see valid response data. How can that be when the callback for failure was called How can I fix this Id like to be able to receive data more than once.p  pThe following code in question is based off the answer to this other question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23716264yelpapiandangularjsYelp API and AngularJSa, the difference being the statements directly below the commentsp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.4.5angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcoauthsignature.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbody ngappplunkergt     ltdiv  ngcontrollerMainCtrlgt         ltpgtltdateinput nameinfo.name messageinfo.messagegtltdateinputgtltpgt         ltulgt             ltli datangrepeatbusiness in businessesgt                 business.name             ltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt     ltscriptgt         function randomStringlength, chars              var result               for var i  length i gt 0 i result  chars[Math.roundMath.random  chars.length  1]             return result                   var app  angular.moduleplunker, []         app.controllerMainCtrl, [scope, MyYelpAPI, functionscope, MyYelpAPI              scope.businesses  []               first time for the callback gets executed             MyYelpAPI.retrieveYelp, functiondata                  console.logcallback1                 console.logdata                 scope.businesses  data.businesses                            the second time for the callback doesnt get executed             MyYelpAPI.retrieveYelp, functiondata                  console.logcallback2                 scope.businesses  data.businesses                       ].factoryMyYelpAPI, functionhttp              return                  retrieveYelp functionname, callback                      var method  GET                     var url  httpapi.yelp.comv2search                     var params                               callback angular.callbacks.0,                             location SanFrancisco,                             oauthconsumerkey ,                              oauthtoken ,                              oauthsignaturemethod HMACSHA1,                             oauthtimestamp new Date.getTime,                             oauthnonce randomString32, 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,                             term food                                              var consumerSecret  ,                     var tokenSecret  ,                     var signature  oauthSignature.generatemethod, url, params, consumerSecret, tokenSecret,  encodeSignature false                     params[oauthsignature]  signature                     http.jsonpurl, params params                         .successcallback                          second time fails                          data gt undefined status gt 404                         .errorfunctiondata, status                              console.logdata, status  why is this happening                                                                     ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre
Negative 28649 pI am working on a WinForms application that has the ability to create and send invoices. In addition to creating invoices locally, the app uses PayPals Permissions APIand the invoicing API to allow the application to optionallysend invoices on the clients behalf.p  pMy question is as follows, what is the best method of keeping track of the current status of invoices sent using PayPal The application needs to know the status of each invoice so it can update its records locally.p  pI am aware of PayPals Instant Payments Notifications although I am unsure how this would fit together with a WinForms application. p  pMy initial thought was to use the PayPal Invoicing API to query the required information on a as and when needtoknow basis. Additionally, a function that ran on a different thread could be run periodically to retrieve information in the background from the API, updating records locally.p  pAm I failing to acknowledge a better solutionp

Negative 28649 pI understand that checked exceptions inherit from codeExceptioncode and that unchecked exceptions extend codeRuntimeExceptioncode. But looking at the a hrefhttpwww.docjar.comhtmlapijavalangRuntimeException.java.html relnofollowsource codea, I cant see whats in RuntimeException that makes it unchecked.p  pIn fact, if I make my own class called codeMyRuntimeExceptioncode and literally copypaste the code from codeRuntimeExceptioncode after stripping out the package declaration and changing the class name, the resulting class will be checked. That is, when I try to throw a MyRuntimeException, the compiler will complain that the exception needs to be caught or declared to be thrown.

Negative 28649 pIn C, Ive heard that you need to separate the implementation from the interface in order to reduce compile times. In a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions48857waystoorganizeinterfaceandimplementationincthisa question, the answerer basically says that if you change the header then the source is recompiled, so if you separate the interface from the implementation then there is less chance you will need to change the header. But here are the two scenarios I seep  ol lipHave all code in header filep  pWhenever you change any code, the entire file is recompiled.pli lipHave code in separate header files and source filesp  pSince the header file is usually copy and pasted via include into the source file, if you make a change to either the header or source files the whole file will still have to be recompiled because it is as if they are one file.p  pWhether you change either the header or the source file, the whole file both the header and the source are recompiled. pli ol  pSo then what is the advantage of separating interface from implementation You might say it is so that you can have multiple implementations for a single interface by means of inheritance, but cant you still do that when you have all the code in the header file You could also say that it is so that the interface does not see any implementation details, but what is the use of thatp  pThe only reason I can see why separating interface from implementation is that if the C compiler emskips over the part of the source file that is the header fileem that is copy and pasted into the source code if it is not changed and just compiles the rest of the source file. So is this the case strongDo C compilers skip compilation of certain parts of files that have not changedstrong I know that that is probably not what happens, but I cannot think of any other explanation.p  pbEditbp  pIve already seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions333889whyhaveheaderfilesandcppfilesincthisa question. What I am asking is iwhyi are the compilation times faster with separate implementation and interface files. I understand that there are advantages with separate implementation and interface files such as what Lightness Races in Orbit stated, but I am asking is bwhy are compile times betterb if they are at all.p

Negative 28649 pLooking the documentation of AWS Elastic Cache I can see they support Redis Cluster and talk about keyvalue data and Redis operations in general. However is not clear for me if this will support replication of Redis pubsub along the different servers.p  pWe are building a chat server on nodexmpp. We will have many application servers for handling chat connections and we are relying on Redis pubsub for handling the communication between chat threads. We require that regardless the actual Redis instance each chat server is communicating to, they can share the same pubsub channel.p  pAt a hrefhttpsd0.awsstatic.comwhitepapersperformanceatscalewithamazonelasticache.pdf relnofollowAWS Elastic cache white paper page 7 a they indicate to use Redis if you want pubsub. I understand from this that AWS Elastic Cache will actual support pubsub scalability but Im not convinced yet.p

Negative 28649 pI have a web application thats written mostly in Jquery, that is essentially a dashboard that a user can add any number of custom widgets to. I have the users currently added widgets, so when its loaded up I masically append each widget to the DOM. I want to work on converting this to an Angular application however im stumbling on one major issue.p  p1I can recreate each widget as a directive, that will work nicely. However what Im struggling with is how to add each widget that a user has setup on load. My first attempt at solving this was to create a generic widget directive, and doing an ngrepeat, and dynamically assigning the widget its controllertemplateUrl. p  pIn theory this seems great however I ran into some issues with not being able to dynamically pass the controller name via attribute. if I hard coded a string value it would work, but wouldnt a databound attribute in the ngrepeat. Example below does not work. p  precodeltquidget ngdynamiccontrollerquidget.QuidgetName ngrepeatquidget in tab.quidgets track by indexgtltquidgetgt codepre  pif instead of quidget.QuidgetName I passed in the actual name of the controller, it would work...like sop  precodeltquidget ngdynamiccontrollerquidget1Controller ngrepeatquidget in tab.quidgets track by indexgtltquidgetgt codepre  pDoes anyone have any insight on how I can go about accomplishing thisp
