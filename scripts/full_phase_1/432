Positive 432 pI just run into an error that said No module name socketio, after adding it to the hidden imports I get No module name server and after adding to the hidden imports socketio.server I get the new one and so on... Is there another way to add every import my application needs p  pHowever if I have to go this way, how can I add import  from .exceptions import WebSocketError, since geventwebsocket.exceptions.WebSocketError is not working p  pThank youp  p[EDIT] Here is more informations. My application works fine from PyCharm, after I create exe with Pyinstaller I get that error, I was doing research for adding imports that Pyinstaller did not caught and all I could find is to change .spec and to add to the hiddenimports what I need. However I thought that adding geventwebsocket will be enough but as I said, now I get Cannot import name WebSocketError .

Positive 432 pI have found many examples that read a SQL database, as using PowerShell on the net.p  pBut, I can not find any example, to read an unknown database with ODBC and powershell. The database handles SQL queries via ODBC I know the name of the ODBC connector DSN  Squid Star The database has no username and password ie the database is open Also knows the names of the various tables, that I would want to read. I want the ability to specify which fields to export with SQL queries such as SELECT  FROM OPERATORp  pThe result should be saved in a CSV file in UTF8 format and preferably with headers.p  hr  pIs it difficult to make an import, with certain fields to the same database via ODBC using PowerShellp  pI have no idea how to fix this, but I think that it should not be so difficult with PowerShellp  pJanp

TDMGCC gfortran is perhaps the closest I got, as I could run a DLL created from gfortran, but not in C. In fact, in TDMGCC gfortran, after I created a Fortran DLL that was referencing a C DLL, all function calls to the Fortran generated DLL within Excel VBA would immediately return 0, even after no warnings were given after compiling the Fortran DLL In other cases, it said it could not find the function name in the DLL, even though I made them without decorations or underscores. Excluding the C DLL from that build would eliminate that problem, but of course, I need to reference the C DLL as it has required 3rd party functions.p  pI looked at other posts and could not find an answer to this questionp  ul lipMy question is not a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22134259fortrandllimportimporting a Fortran DLL into c or Capli lipI do not get the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10381739runfortrandllwithvisualstudioAdd as Link option when right clicking AddExisting Itemapli lipThe answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1237129howtocallcsharpcodefromfortrandllthis posta did not solve my questionpli lipA similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23433508fortrancallingacdllwhichinturncallsanotherfortrandllherea was not answered adequatelypli ul  pPlease provide a stepbystep guide to getting Fortran to work with DLLIMPORT, with both gfortran and Intel Visual Studio Fortran, if possible.

Negative 432 pIm asking for a suitable architecture for the following Java web application p  pThe goal is to build several web applications which all operate on the same data. Suppose a banking system in which account data can be accessed by different web applications it can be accessed by customers online banking, by service personal mostly read and by the account administration department admin tool. These applications run as separate web applications on different machines but they use the same data and a set of common data manipulation and search queries.p  pA possible approach is to build a core application which fits the common needs of the clients, namely data storage, manipulation and search facilities. The clients can then call this core application to fulfil their requests. The requirement is the applications are build on top of a WicketSpringHibernate stack as WARs.p  pTo get a picture, here are some of the possible approaches we thought ofp  pA The monolithic approach. Build one huge web application that fits all needs this is not really an optionp  pB The API approach. Build a core database access API JAR for data accessmanipulation. Each web application is build as a separate WAR which uses the API to access a database. There is no separate core application.p  pC RMI approach. The core application runs as a standalone application possibly a WAR and offers services via RMI or HttpInvoker.p  pD WS approach. Just like C but replace RMI with Web Servicesp  pE OSGi approach. Build all the components as OSGi modules and which run in an OSGi container. Possibly use SpringSource dm Server or ModuleFusion. This approach was not an option for us for some reasons ...p  pHope I could make clear the problem. We are just going the with option B, but Im not very confident with it.

As new formats come I just have to write new FormatXSerializer classes.p  precodeFormatASerializer.SerializeXmlWriter writer, MainResponse r FormatASerializer.SerializeXmlWriter writer, ShutDownResponse r FormatBSerializer.SerializeXmlWriter writer, MainResponse r FormatBSerializer.SerializeXmlWriter writer, ShutDownResponse r codepre  por should the DTOs themself know how to do it. So I have it all in one place  for each DTO class. As new DTO classes come, they just have to implement the serialization for the various formats. As new formats come, I have to touch each DTO class.p  precodemyMainRequestInstace.SerializeFormatTypeEnum type, XmlWriter writer codepre  pOr is there a complete different approach Should I introduce a common inteface for serialization and have some inversion of control, so I could load new format serializers at runtime p  pWhat design pattern can guide me herep  pWhat open source code in the .NET world could I study to see different approaches on this subjectp  pstrongEDIT I know about the general serialization techniques existing in the framework. My question is more geared towards class design that respects the two requirements multiple xml formats and multiple DTOs message types that keep coming as the project evolves.strongp

Negative 432 pIs there a nontoyish tool that can create a call graph of the whole application I dont mean just getting a picture or drawing call graph by means of pointing methodbymethod.p  pI need a call graph, which is accessible programmatically, i.e. the tool should flush it to a file in text mode e.g. XML or build the call graph in memory which becomes problematic for large application. A call graph built in a DB would be great.p  pBoth static and dynamic call graphs are in demand though static one is a little more interesting, the fact that it is overapproximated is acceptable.p  pI have tried Soot so far. However, it is not able to handle even mediumsize projects like FreeCol java sources are available. Soot depletes 1.5GB of memory on that project, and then JVM crashes, as described here a hrefhttpwww.sable.mcgill.capipermailsootlist2008July001828.htmlhttpwww.sable.mcgill.capipermailsootlist2008July001828.htmlap  pCould anyone suggest a tool to generate a call graph, as described above Java or .NET languages are ok.p  pBest regards, Sargep

I configured Hibernate then to fetch the field value also as NULL.p  pThe customer wants to configure these values in case these are NULL. So I decided to have a Properties file containing the default values so nobody has to alter Annotations or database schemes...p  pMy problem now is that I dont know how to realize that in a cool way. The main object I am working with is called Job and contains some joined tables. I dont want to assign the properties file to the Job object, because it wouldnt be persistent anymore. How can I tell Hibernate during creation  hey, you also need a Properties file in case you find NULL columnsp  pCurrently, the only solution I see is to walk over the complete fetched List and analyze the contents of each Job and set them properly if some fields are NULL.p  pApparently, I wondered if there is better way to do that...p  pThanks for your help and regards from rainy Bonn, Germany,p  pMarcop

Negative 432 pBasically, I have two tables, Table A contains the actual items that I care to get out, and Table B is used for language translations.p  pSo, for example, Table A contains the actual content. Anytime text is used within the table, instead of storing actual varchar values, ids are stored that relate back to text stored in Table B. This allows me to by adding a languageID column to Table B, have multiple translations for the same row in the database.p  pExamplep  h2Table Ah2  ul liTitle int li liDescription intli liOther Data....li ul  h2Table Bh2  ul liTextID int  This is the column whose value is stored in other tablesli liLanguageID intli liText varcharli ul  pMy question is more a call for suggestions on how to best handle this. Ideally I want a query that I can use to select from the table, and get the text as opposed to the ids of the text out of the table. Currently when I have two text items in the table this is what I dop  precodeSELECT C.ID, C.Title, D.Text AS Description FROM SELECT A.ID, A.Description, B.Text AS Title FROM TableA A, TranslationsTable B WHERE A.Title  B.TextID AND B.LanguaugeID  1 C LEFT JOIN TranslationsTable D ON C.Description  D.TextID AND D.LanguaugeID  1 codepre  pThis query gives me the row from Table A I am looking for using where statements in the inner select statement with the actual text based on the language ID used instead of the text ids.p  pThis works fine when I am only using one or two text items that need to be translated, but adding a third item or more, it starts to get really messy  essentially another left join on top of the example.p  pAny suggestions on a better query, or at least a good way to handle 3 or more text items in a single rowp  pPer suggestions, Ive added an example of the two tablesp  precode    Table A            ID    Title    Description              1     1        2              2     3        4              Table B Translations Table           ID    LanguaugeIDText              1     1        Here is title one            1     2        Here is a title one in espanol          2     1        Here is description one            2     2        Here is description one in espanol          3     1        Title 2            4     1        Description 2         codepre  pWhat I want is to be able to pull a row out of table A that already has the text from table B, not just the ids  and to be able to do this for several columns that need translations.p

Negative 432 pIn my program Ive got two data files A and B. The data in A is static and the data in B refers back to the data in A. In order to make sure the data in B is invalidated when A is changed, I keep an identifier for each of the links which is a long bytestring identifying the data. I get this string using BitConverter on some of the important properties.p  pMy problem is that this scheme isnt working. I save the identifiers initially, and with I reload with the exact same data in A the identifiers dont match anymore. It seems the bit converter gives different results when I go to save.p  pThe emreallyem weird thing about it is, if I place a breakpoint in the save code, I can see the identifier its writing to the file is fine, and the next load works. If I dont place a breakpoint and say emprintem the identifiers to console instead, theyre totally different. Its like when my program is running at fullspeed the CPU messes up some instructions.p  pThis isnt the first time something like this happens to me. Ive seen it in other projects. What gives Has anyone every experienced this kind of debugging weirdness I cant explain how stopping the program and not stopping it can change the output. Also, its not a hardware problem because this happens on my laptop as well.p

Negative 432 pI have some problems when I want to use implicit methods to convert a strongfunctionstrong to something else.p  pIm implementing a small DSL in Scala 2.8 for testing purposes.

Negative 432 pI am writing a music player that uses a custom Adapter extending BaseAdapter efficiency adapter that I want to display in an codeAlertDialogcode using codesetAdaptercode where the user can either click on one of the songs to switch to that position in the playlist OR check songs to remove from the playlist. I tried using a custom click listener so that a user could just long click to remove the item from the list but the codelistviewcode just doesnt work right... it was removing the wrong items the ones at the end even though the codeArrayListcode contained the correct playlist items... when I removed the item from the codeArrayListcode, I passed it to the adapter which called codenotifyDataSetChangedcode... but that just didnt work as I mentioned. There is definitely a bug in the codeAlertDialog ListViewcode... because there is no reason for it to have popped off the results from the end rather than the correct item.p  pSo... the next method I would like to try is to use the codesetMultiChoiceItemscode method of the codeAlertDialogcode... but it appears that it doesnt work with a custom adapter... only simple arrays. Will I have to subclass codeAlertDialogcode and codeOverridecode the codesetMultiChoiceItemscode method or is there a way I can make it work with an codeArrayAdaptercodep  pBasically, I cant figure out how to even iterate the list that the codeAlertDialogcode creates or whether it even passes that view somehow. In addition, I dont think I can even listen to clicks on codecheckboxescode if I add those to the row. Any help will be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT Asking questions here is like magic... I answered my own question... this is how I did it. I added a hint to each codecheckboxcode which is the position of the item in the codeArrayListcode. Then I used codeOnCheckedChangeListenercode to capture the selections. When you set a hint it adds text to the codecheckboxcode... since the background of the codeAlertDialogcode is white even for clicked items I just set the hint text color to transparent.p  precodeholder.check.setHintTextColorColor.TRANSPARENT holder.check.setHintString.valueOfposition holder.check.setOnCheckedChangeListenernew OnCheckedChangeListener   public void onCheckedChangedCompoundButton buttonView,             boolean isChecked          int position  Integer.parseIntString buttonView.getHint         Log.vonCheckedChanged, Checked isChecked returned position which should be getItemposition.name                                 codepre

Negative 432 pIs there a possibility to declare a codeIValueConvertercode for an application global, so that if a conversion in a Binding is needed, automatically the appropriate converter is used.p  pstrongE.g.strong p  pI have written a codeIValueConvertercode that converts between codeintcode and codeMySpecialClasscode. I have a codeBindingcode that has a source that returns an instance of codeMySpecialClasscode and a target that is codeintcode.p  pWith that globaly declared codeValueConvertercode, the conversion will automatically be done without the need of a converterdeclaration with the codeConvertercodekeyword in the Binding. p  pDoes such a possibility existsp

Negative 432 pIm encountering somewhat of an, uh, unorthodox design and Im not quite sure how to handle it. The table Im trying to map looks likep  precodeTABLE example      ID INT,     CATEGORY VARCHAR,     PROPERTY VARCHAR,     VALUE VARCHAR codepre  pA single id can have several rows obviously, not a primary key.

Property names are unique for any given id, category combination.p  pEDIT The ID field is a foreign key to objects in a different table. I need to be able to get from these objects to the various properties stored in this table, using only the ID field. If a composite key is the way to go, how do I then link themp  pEDIT2 I also think the detail youre missing here is that all the data with the same ID in column one conceptually belongs to the same object. I dont want a separate instance for every ID,CATEGORY combination.p  pObviously, this isnt very normalized. Worst case scenario, I set up some extra tables that are normalized and copy everything over, but I was wondering if anyone could suggest a sensible way to get this information into hibernate backed objects directly If necessary in some sort of bag of String properties.p  pIm using hibernateannotations btw.p

Negative 432 pIm building a site with a lot of similar css between pages.

Negative 432 pI have a program that creates a table, adds it to a flow document along with table cells that are populated with text.  Everything works great with one exception.

I would guess because the font is not equal width for each character.p  pWhat I would like to do is be able to display the costs just like the are when in an Excel spreadsheet when formatted as Accounting ie the dollar sign is left hand justified, the numbers are right hand justified and the numbers are lined up from cell to cell. p  pExamplep  blockquote   p   10,000.00br      11,111.11p blockquote  pIf someone knows what formatting to apply to reach this goal please let me know.p
Negative 432 pI have a server say XYZ and many clients of different domain,  say A, B and C.  authentication is done at server.    when user comes first time to any of the site, we will ask him to create  the account for the site. he will enter email and password. we will sent the data to server and stores thr. now he has account in XYZ so that he can login to any of the site A, B and c. p  pNextfor example say, He come to site B, to login, he enters email and password. we will take this data to server to verify, if password matches with email, we send status Yes back to client so the he login successfully and go to inner pages.p  pBecause sending email and status yes back to clink is not safe. we are using socket programming. so that outside people will not know what data we are sending and getting back.   because we are using socket, we are not able to create any session or cookies, because we are not opening server site in browser.p  pI want,like  when user successfully logs into site B. if simultaneously  in next tab he goes for site C. he should not asked for to loginshould not show login page.  he automatically gets logged ingoes to inner pages. p

Negative 432 pIm looking for a way to have to write and maintain a certain algorithm a graphics rendering submodule of my code, actually only once. I need the algorithm in C, PHP and Javascript. Theoretically I could write it in C and wrap it into a PHP extension but that has many issues of itself and doesnt solve the Javascript link.p  pWhat Im looking for, I  think, is a tool that converts from a language doesnt matter which one into the three or two, if the source language is one of the three output languages Im targetting. Ive found MetaL httpwww.metalanguage.net which seems to do what I want but also looks dead no updates since 2007 and only targets one of the three languages I need. It needs to be quite flexible and allow me to update the results  for example, I use Cairo in my C and PHP rendering, and HTML Canvas on the Javascript side. So I need to customize to the API for certain effects.p  pAlternatively, Id settle for a PHP parser and lexer that would give me an AST with enough information for me to write generators for C and Javascript as an alternative backend. p  pAny ideas Thanks.p

It feels like it should be done at a higher level. p  pFor example, I defined a death state which resizes the item to height0.

Negative 432 pIm in the process of making a fairly complex application. It is expected to run across multiple web servers, otherwise this would be easy. p  pBasically, we have a set of Client records. Each Client record has an XML column which contains all of the real data, such as the clients name and other fields which are made dynamically. Our users can update a clients record at anytime. Also, we have Application records. Each application is tied to multiple clients. Each application is usually tied to more than 3 clients. Each clients XML data is greater than 5k of text, usually.p  pIn some profiling Ive done, obtaining and deserializing this XML data is a fairly expensive operation.

Negative 432 pI have a PHP script that performs an MS SQL query and outputs an XML file.  Whenever I run the query in SQL Management Studio, the results are correct.  However, when I place the same query in the PHP code, the XML that outputs doesnt have the correct amount in the tot node.  All other nodes flow through correctly.

Negative 432 pIm writing a Java app which has a feature to check whether its connected to the internet by periodically trying to access a server. My first idea was to Ping the server  but turned out to be complicated to achieve in Java. So I remade it to send HTTP HEAD requests and check for the HTTP response code instead. I have two questionsp  p1 Are HTTP HEAD requests as reliable as pings Ping would be my first natural choice to check if something is available. Maybe just because its so easy to run on the command line.p  p2 If I send HTTP HEAD requests to a thirdparty website to check if it is accessible, is there some standard frequency at which these should be sent Eg if I send them every second, would that be discouraged or even get me blocked from those servicesp
Negative 432 pI have a resque worker which works great but is just too slow.  The main reason for this is Im using activerecord and having to load the entire environment which takes at least 1020 seconds just to load up I dont keep a running worker at all times as Im using Heroku and pay for the time the worker runs.  Im using a resque worker to grab amp parse data from an external website and then dumping the data into my database.p  pMy question is whether I should rewrite the method to not use Rails and instead use DataMapper  Or something else which would load faster than activerecord.  p  pOr If I should extract the code using ActiveRecord which figures out what to do with the external data and move it out of the worker and back into the appp  pHope that makes sense. p

At this point, the TCPListener seems to stop listening.  The problem is that I cant test this easily, as it only happens on a remote test VM and only once every 24 hours or so.  If I knew how to recreate the error with a test client, I would be able to figure this out.  Wireshark shows a reset [RST] packet being sent at around the time of the exception.  So I either need to know how to handle the exception, or how to recreate the problem with a test client.p

Do something    codepre  pstrongTake notice of the optional param3 parameter.strongp  pNow for quite a few reasons I need to extract the code of the MyMethod method into its own class but I cannot extract ProtectedMethod with it because of all the classes that are inheriting from this one and I need to keep the changes small and isolated. So I figured I could have an Actionlt delegate in the new class with the same signature as ProtectedMethod.p  pThe problem is that if I declare the delegate like thisp  precodeprotected readonly ActionltIEnumerableltstringgt, string, intgt mProtectedMethod codepre  pThe extracted code does not like it because it says the method is only being invoked with two parameters.p  pAnd if I declare the delegate like sop  precodeprotected readonly ActionltIEnumerableltstringgt, stringgt mProtectedMethod codepre  pWhen I send it as a parameter to the new class it does not like it either because the method is defined as having three parameters not two.p  pSo far the only way I have thought of to solve this is to create an overloaded version of  ProtectedMethod to eliminate the optional parameter. p  pIs this the only option or is there another way of doing it since now the preferred choice is to have optional parameters instead of overloaded methods p

Usually, with imageprocessing, we have been tought that the image is read from top left to bottom right, but after some testing, it seems that it does the exact opposite, starting at the lower right corner and moving to the upper leftp  pSo the question here is In which order does FindContours find its Contours Am I right in my assumption or is it my own code confusing me p  pInput a hrefhttpi32.photobucket.comalbumsd37EthaloxBlobtest06.png relnofollowBlobtest06ap  pa hrefhttpi32.photobucket.comalbumsd37EthaloxComponents.jpg relnofollowComponents windowap  pa hrefhttpi32.photobucket.comalbumsd37EthaloxConsole.jpg relnofollowConsoleap  precodeinclude ltopencv2opencv.hppgt include ltiostreamgt include ltopencv2coremat.hppgt include ltWindows.hgt for sleep function  using namespace cv using namespace std  void IsolateGreenMat mIn, Matamp mOut  Mat inImg mIn.rows, mIn.cols, CV8UC3, Scalar1,2,3 inImg.data  mIn.data Mat channelRed inImg.rows, inImg.cols, CV8UC1 Mat channelGreen inImg.rows, inImg.cols, CV8UC1 Mat channelBlue inImg.rows, inImg.cols, CV8UC1 Mat outImg[]  channelRed, channelGreen, channelBlue  int fromTo[]   0,2, 1,1, 2,0 mixChannels ampinImg, 1, outImg, 3, fromTo, 3  mOut  channelGreen  channelRed  channelBlue  thresholdmOut, mOut, 5, 255, THRESHBINARY  erodemOut, mOut, Mat, Point 1,1, 1 dilatemOut, mOut, Mat, Point1,1, 2    void FindContoursMatamp mDst, Mat mGreenScale, vectorltvectorltPointgtgtamp vecContours, vectorltVec4igtamp vecHierarchy, Mat img  This is empty at all times.

Negative 432 pOk so i am using the following jquery dropdown menu.  I found this code online and it works fine.  All i want to change is the openclose functionality.  Right now it is mouseover mouseout to show and hide the menus.  I want to change it so that that the menus are displayed onclick.  So when the user clicks the menu it opens and stays open.  Then when they select a link from the dropdown it  closes.  Also i need it to close if they click somewhere else on the page.  I think this is acheived by using the toggle event but i have been trying for hours to get it to work and have not been successful.  can anyone help  Code is below.p  pHtmlp  precodeltul idjsddmgt     ltligtlta hrefgtJavaScriptltagt         ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefgtDrop Down Menultagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtjQuery Pluginltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtAjax Navigationltagtltligt         ltulgt     ltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtEffectltagt         ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefgtSlide Effectltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtFade Effectltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtOpacity Modeltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtDrop Shadowltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtSemitransparentltagtltligt         ltulgt     ltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtNavigationltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtHTMLCSSltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtHelpltagtltligt ltulgt codepre  pCSSp  precodejsddm    margin 0     padding 0      jsddm li        float left         liststyle none         font 12px Tahoma, Arial      jsddm li a        display block         background 20548E         padding 5px 12px         textdecoration none         borderright 1px solid white         width 70px         color EAFFED         whitespace nowrap      jsddm li ahover        background 1A4473          jsddm li ul            margin 0             padding 0             position absolute             visibility hidden             bordertop 1px solid white          jsddm li ul li            float none             display inline          jsddm li ul li a            width auto             background 9F1B1B          jsddm li ul li ahover            background 7F1616 codepre  pjavascriptp  precodevar timeout     500 var closetimer  0 var ddmenuitem  0  function jsddmopen   jsddmcanceltimer    jsddmclose    ddmenuitem  this.findul.cssvisibility, visible  function jsddmclose   ifddmenuitem ddmenuitem.cssvisibility, hidden  function jsddmtimer   closetimer  window.setTimeoutjsddmclose, timeout  function jsddmcanceltimer   ifclosetimer      window.clearTimeoutclosetimer       closetimer  null  document.readyfunction   jsddm gt li.bindmouseover, jsddmopen    jsddm gt li.bindmouseout,  jsddmtimer  document.onclick  jsddmclose codepre  pI have tried playing with the last 4 lines of the above js changing the mouseover to onclick and also have tried some variations of toggle but havent been able to get it to work.

Negative 432 pI am looking to move the InkPresenter in the InkCanvas to have a ZIndex that is lower than the Children of the InkCanvas. p  pIn other words, I want to move the Ink so that it is displayed under the images and user controls that are added to the InkCanvas as Children.p  pI was wondering if there is a way to edit the Control Template of the InkCanvas to achieve this I have been completely unsuccessful at accomplishing this task. p  pOriginally I was using the InkCanvas as one layer and placed the children into a Canvas control that is on top of the InkCanvas however, I want to be able to select the Children and the Strokes together...since the InkCanvas has this built in I was hoping to not use 2 controls like this.p  pThanks.p  pFrinnyp
Negative 432 pIm designing the data model for an app with the LINQ to SQL OR designer and wonder is it possible to have many classes implement an interface or base class and store the implemented fields values in the DBp  pMost if not all of my classes need common fields to be stored that describe metadata about the object, such as when and by whom the object was created, whether the object was deleted and when it was last modified... The values for these fields would ideally just go into columns on the implementing classes tables in the database.p  pI know of the option to specify a global base class or interface in the .dbml file, but thats not very elegant since I will have some L2S classes that dont implement the interface.p  pI know that this is easy to do with something like NHibernate. Id just like to see if there is a way to do this with LINQ to SQL in an elegant way.p  pAny pointersp

The response to a JSONP request namely, a   request following the JSONP usage pattern is not JSON and is not   parsed as JSON the returned payload can be any arbitrary JavaScript   expression, and it does not need to include any JSON at all. But   conventionally, it is a JavaScript fragment that invokes a function   call on some JSONformatted data.p blockquote  pSo is there any global definition what is valid JSONP response and what JavaScript constructs are allowed Should I expect any JavaScript code because that is what current browsers accept because it has codeapplicationjavascriptcode content typep

Right now i imported them as embedded videos. however, this causes the performance to drop significantly, making the game unplayable.p  pCan anyone give me performance optimization tips on how to have animations playing on 3D transformed layersp  pThanksp  pedit answer to first commentp  pthe stage contains one child representing the 3D scene this movieClip is moved in Z direction to make the camera move through the scene. this sceneClip contains one big clip rotated 90 degree arround X 3D to represent the floor as well as aproximately 20 clips facing the camera and lying on different Z depths. Each of these 20 child clips contains 18 animated children. An animated child clip consists of a prerendered animation of aproximately 20 frames in resolution 150x150. In total there are about 2030 such animated clips.p  pi know that flash caches some movieClips together with their children as bitmaps when the clip is 3D transformed. maybe updating these caches when the animations play is causing the performance drop. maybe restructuring the nesting could solve the problemp

Negative 432 pi have a problem in the code which could be probably eliminated by implementing onintercepttouchevent, but i did not understand about it. i have looked at the drag and drop example as well. my doubt is that do we need to implement onintercepttouchevent and ontouchevent methods for each and every view. i am not understanding how to implement them. how to find the source of the motion event. Very confusing for me. so please clear my doubts and if possible give me some sample codes to understand  its usage clearly.p  pone more doubt suppose if the current motion event is ACTIONMOVE  then in that case,how to cancel the motion event. to prevent it from going to ACTIONUP. i want to recognize the sliding on buttons sayp  p1 2 3 4 5p  pif the user slides on from button 1 to button 3, the immediate next button is touched it should be updated to the down eventp

Negative 432 pI have some java code that needs to programmatically render text onto an image. So I use BufferedImage, and write text on the Graphics object.p  pHowever, when configuring the font instance, one would specify the font size in points. When a piece of text is rendered onto an image, AWT will translate the points into pixels, based on the resolution of the Graphics object. I dont want to get myself involved in computing the pixelpoint ratio, since its really the task for the AWT. The image that is being produced is for a high resolution device higher than any desktop monitors.p  pBut, I dont seem to find a way to specify what the resolution of the Graphics is. It inherits it from the local graphics environment, which is beyond my control. I dont really want this code to be dependent on anything local, and Im not even sure its sane, to use local graphics environment for determining the resolution of off screen rasters, who knows what people would want them for.p  pSo, any way I can specify the resolution for an off screen image of any kind preferably the one that can create Graphics object so I can use standard AWT rendering APIp  pupdate Here is a rather long sample problem that renders a piece of text on an image, with predefined font size in strongpixelsstrong effectively, the target device DPI is 72. What bugs me, is that I have to use local screen DPI to make the calculation of the font size in points, though Im not using the screen in any way, so its not relevant, and plain fails on headless systems all together. What I would loved in this case instead, is being able to create an off screen image graphics, raster, with DPI of 72, which would make points, by value, be equal to pixels.p  pSample way to run the codep  precode java FontDisplay Monospace 150 Cat in a bag 1.png codepre  pThis would render Cat in a bag message, with font size of 150 pixels, on a 150 pixel tall image, and save the result in 1.png.p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.image. import java.awt.font. import javax.imageio. import javax.imageio.stream. import java.io. import java.util.  public class FontDisplay       public static void mainString a[] throws Exception            args ltfontnamegt ltpixelheightgt lttextgt ltimagefilegt          image file must have supported extension.          int height  Integer.parseInta[1]         String text  a[2]          BufferedImage bi  new BufferedImage1, 1,                 BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB          int dpi  Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.getScreenResolution         System.out.printlndpi  dpi         float points  floatheight  72.0F  floatdpi         System.out.printlnpoints  points          Map m  new HashMap         m.putTextAttribute.FAMILY, a[0]         m.putTextAttribute.SIZE, points          Font f  Font.getFontm          if f  null              throw new ExceptionFont a[0] not found on your system                   Graphics2D g  bi.createGraphics          FontMetrics fm  g.getFontMetricsf          int w  fm.charsWidthtext.toCharArray, 0, text.length          bi  new BufferedImagew, height, BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB          g  bi.createGraphics         g.setColorColor.BLACK         g.fillRect0, 0, w, height         g.setColorColor.WHITE         g.setRenderingHintRenderingHints.KEYTEXTANTIALIASING,                 RenderingHints.VALUETEXTANTIALIASLCDHRGB         g.setFontf         g.drawStringtext, 0, fm.getMaxAscent          String fName  a[3]         String ext  fName.substringfName.lastIndexOf.1.toLowerCase          File file  new FilefName         ImageWriter iw  ImageIO.getImageWritersBySuffixext.next          ImageOutputStream ios  ImageIO.createImageOutputStreamfile         iw.setOutputios         iw.writebi         ios.flush         ios.close         codepre

Negative 432 pId like to write a simple function that iterates over the lines of a text file. I believe in code2.8code one could dop  precodedef linesfilename String  Iterator[String]        scala.io.Source.fromFilefilename.getLines  codepre  pand that was that, but in code2.9code the above doesnt work and instead I must dop  precodedef linesfilename String  Iterator[String]        scala.io.Source.fromFilenew Filefilename.getLines  codepre  pNow, the trouble is, I want to compose the above iterators in a codeforcode comprehensionp  precodefor  l1 lt linesfile1.txt l2 lt linesfile2.txt       dostuffl1, l2   codepre  pThis again, used to work fine with code2.8code but causes a too many open files  exception to get thrown in code2.9code. This is understandable  the second codelinescode  in the comprehension ends up opening and not closing a file for each line  in the first.p  pIn my case, I know that the codefile1.txtcode is big and I dont want to suck it intobr memory, but the second file is small, so I can write a different codelinesEagercode  like sop  precodedef linesEagerfilename String Iterator[String]       val buf  scala.io.Source.fromFilenew Filefilename     val zs   buf.getLines.toList.toIterator     buf.close     zs codepre  pand then turn my forcomprehension intop  precodefor l1 lt linesfile1.txt l2 lt linesEagerfile2.txt      dostuffl1, l2   codepre  pThis works, but is clearly ugly. Can someone suggest a uniform amp clean  way of achieving the above.

Negative 432 pI need to develop several calendar type controls in winforms. These calendars are all vertical in nature.

Ive attached a screenshot of how it looks at the moment.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4rTNd.png altenter image description herep  pIve come up against problems in rendering the well known stuttering problem, which Ive gotten over by hiding the grid while its being built, and then showing it when its done. Also, Ive had problems with getting the table to resize correctly the number of columns changes depending on the number of days in the month, as you can see in the screenshot the bottom row takes up all space. As you can imagine, this is all very nasty and seems to me to be rather hacky. p  pIve tried WPF a bit to see if I can overcome the problems, but it seems that though it may render a bit better, the issues with columns and row sizing are the same. Is there some other approach I could take to avoid these issues, or is it best to bite the bullet and just switch to WPF I find it double frustrating because it would be quite an easy job to get this done in HTML using a table. p  pTo reiterate the issues that Im having arep  ol liColumns are not automatically resizing as I would expect the last column just fills the space making for some odd UIli liRows are similar, with the bottom row taking up all the empty space.li liSlow renderingli liWhen resizing the control have to hide the grid otherwise get lots of stutteringli liThe hacky nature of the table layout panelli ol  pI appreciate any feedback users have on how I should best approach the problem.p

Negative 432 pI have a dynamically sized uitableviewcell with 4 subviews. So my cell looks like thisp  precode    Image       Label1                        Label2                        Label3                             codepre  pLabel2 and Label3 and the Image are statically sized. I know what their size is going to be before I populate them with text. Label1 is dynamically sized according to its text content. Label1 is restricted to 3 lines of text and has wordwrap linebreak mode on. The issue happens when the following steps are followedp  ol liUser looks at tableviewcell containing Label1 with 2 lines of text in portrait modeli liUser switches to landscape mode. Label1 is resized correctly.li liUser scrolls away from the cell at step 1, causing it to be put in reusablecell queue.li liuser switches back to portrait mode and scrolls back to cell from step 1. The size of Label1 is now much bigger than it needs to be bigger than it was in portrait mode originally  and since the other labels are placed at points that depend on label1s size, they are also out of place.li ol  pI am using code[text sizeWithFontlabel.font constrainedToSizemaxSize lineBreakModelabel.lineBreakMode]code to get the size of the uilabel. This happens in codetableViewwillDisplayCellforRowAtIndexPathcode. I am also using the following autoresizemasks on Label1 codeUIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeightcode. Im calculating the frame of the cell and its subviews in codetableViewwillDisplayCellforRowAtIndexPathcode and at first it seemed like this is where the problem was. But debugging shows that this method returns the correct frame for Label1. Im guessing label1 must be getting resized after I set the frame and causing issuesp  pAlso, Label2 and Label3 have these autoresizemasks codeUIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth  UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargincode.p
Negative 432 pIm writing a J2EEJPASpring 3 application, trying to stay pure JPA 2.0. I want to get a count of child objects without having to load them, as its obviously an expensive operation. For example heres a simplified examplep  precodeOrganisation   OrgID   OrgName  Employee   EmployeeID   OrgID key to Organisation table   EmployeeName codepre  pOn a jsp page I want to show the list of all organisations and a count of the number of employees without loading the employees themselves. If it can be a single database hit that loads all the Organisation objects and somehow loads a count of the Employee objects that would be great. Id rather avoid  one query to list the organisations then one for each organisation to count the employees. I guess I could add a transient property to hold the count, Im not sure how to best do that.p  pJust to give an idea of scale, there will be around 50 organisations, and each organisation will have between 0 and 500 employees. I would rather avoid any implementation specific extensions, as Ive changed JPA providers once and may change again.p  pIn SQL Id just do a join, group, and count, but I dont have a clue how to do it in JPA.

Negative 432 pI have implemented the slide menu but I want sliding effect exactly like facebook.  I came across following post on stackoverflow p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7991034iphonefacebooksidemenuusingobjectiveciphone facebook side menu using objective cap  pIn which I want to implement the solution given by greenisus up voted 15 times but I am having the trouble implementing that, same trouble has been raised by Bot in comments to his answer.  greenisus Im confused on how you sent the menu to the back When I do that it just shows a black side menu. which has not been answered. p  h2The text of his answer for reference ish2  pIts pretty simple really. First, you need to make a view controller that sits under the one thats visible. You can send that view to the back like thisp  precode[self.view sendSubviewToBackmenuViewController.view] codepre  pThen, you put a menu button on the left side of your navigation bar, and write a handler kind of like thisp  precode voidmenuButtonPressedidsender      CGRect destination  self.navigationController.view.frame     if destination.origin.x gt 0          destination.origin.x  0      else          destination.origin.x  254.5          [UIView animateWithDuration0.25 animations         self.navigationController.view.frame  destination              completionBOOL finished          self.view.userInteractionEnabled  destination.origin.x gt 0     ]  codepre  h2Thats the general idea. You may have to change the code to reflect your view hierarchy, etc.h2  pJust want to know when we have to use the following method, the second method is simple and works fine, but doesnt show menu view under it.p  precode[self.view sendSubviewToBackmenuViewController.view] codepre  pLooking for some pointers or solution to run the above code correctly. p

I have no issues in loading the window as it just prepares the form to be displayed. While the quote is to be saved, all these product forms will be submitted and the logic that I incorporated is that 1 to N1 action instances will put the form values in a VO which is added to a Vector object and saved in session so that other action instance can take it from session and add on top of it. The N th action instance is meant to save the all these product values collectively. The business rule validation is also performed just before saving and hence the Nth action instance will be made available with the errors which should be displayed in each and every Product window. p  pJust to make sure that all other action instances also avail the errors corresponding to their window, I implemented the wait and notifyAll mechanism wherein things go awry when more than 6 products are tried to be saved. The code is given below. This piece of code works just fine for products less that or equal to 6 I mean upto 6 action instances. When the 7th product is loaded and saved, the seventh instance is not at all visible or traceable in debug mode instance does not reach the intended method upon form submission. p  pCould anyone throw some light on the mistake that is committed here which is responsible for this issue.p  precodepublic String submitProducts         throws Exception       String resultValue        Algorithm       1.

Negative 432 pSo, in my rails app I ajaxified the error messages on one of my pages. the process was so everyone understands first, in my edit codelinktocode I added coderemote gt truecode at the end of it thus having it send an ajax request. I then added the line codeformat.jscode in my coderespondto do formatcode block. Then, I made an edit.js.erb file with the following line of code codeerror.htmllt flash[error] gtcode  which basically finds the error div in the current page and replaces the html in that div with the error flash message. This is cool right No more annoying page refreshes in the event of an error.p  pQuestion is, I want to do this for all my edit and destroy pages, but how without making an edit.js.erb and destroy.js.erb file for each view folder seems pretty simple, and maybe im just missing an obvious answer because Im exhausted, but I cant figure it out... so... helpp  pEDITp  pthis is my edit controllerp  precodedef edit user  User.findsession[id] table  Table.findparams[id]    if user.id  table.createdby    flash[error]  ERROR   respondto do format     format.js render template gt sharedshowerror     format.html   end else   flash[error]     respondto do format     format.js render template gt tableedit, formats gt html     format.html   end  end end codepre  pProblem now is, it works fine for showing the errors but if there are no errors it doesnt action render the edit page...

Negative 432 pIm developing an application that does computations per vertex of a graph. The main problem here is that of latency as each computation is rather small.  For example, each computation might take 10ms to execute by itself, so PGBL should not add any significant latency to the process.p  pI can code my own barebones graph routines to accomplish this task. Of course PBGL has many more features that would be nice to have. For example, I would like to potentially even off load some computations to the cloud when latency is not an issue.p  pSo basically, what is the overhead of computations across vectors on a cpu or multicore cpu Also, would it be possible to off load vertex computations to a gpu in the futurep  pIve never used PGBL but ran across it in the boost library and it caught my eye as something that might be near perfect for my application except for potentially latency issues.p  pFor example, what would the performance difference be between a very simple tree that is divided up into n branches which computations of each branch ran on a separate core vs using PBGL for small computation times, obviously the larger the computation the less of a differencep

Negative 432 pcan somebody explain to me why it takes 6 to 10 seconds to import an entity into Neo4jp  pIm using Spring Data Neo4j with a custom Repository, that has codeNeo4jTemplate Autowirecoded. So when Im persisting an entity I call codetemplate.saveentitycode. I do have to say though that the entity is a bit heavy. It has 47 properties, i.e. fields, 3 of them are marked with codeIndexedcode annotation and 10 of them are other custom entities marked with codeRelatedTocode. 5 of the codeRelatedTocode fields are of type codeSetcode. Which means that actually when importing this one heavy entity another 1015 entities could potentially also be persisted and connected to it.p  pIs that the actual problem or is there something I can do that could speed up the processp  pIve looked around and found the codeBatchInsertercode but it doesnt take care of the indexes. I found a hrefhttpcode.paananen.fi20120405neo4jbatchinserterandspringdataforneo4j relnofollowthisa example implementation, but I would try it if there is no other other option. p  pSo I guess what Im trying to understand is, if the heavy entity is the reason for the slow persisting or something else.p  pIm using Neo4j 1.8 and havent touched the config files. p  pAny help is appreciated. Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Michael Hungerbr  The amount of data in the DB doesnt seem to have an effect.br  Im not using AspectJ, so I guess Im using simple mapping, right Do you think I would get a better performance with AspectJbr  I dont think I have an external transaction spanning the codesavecode method. Im using the DB from a Wicket web application. Would it be better if I used Neo4js REST API with for example emJerseyem REST clientsbr  If there is an attribute in the class of a custom type, e.g. codeArea areacode, then another node will be automatically created for this codeareacode as well as a connection between the main node and the codeareacode, right So there is no need for codetemplate.createRelationshipBetweenentity1, entity2, type, properties, truecode, right What I would have to do, to use this, is to remove the codeareacode attribute and then use some index to find the correct codeareacode and then make the connection manually.

Negative 432 pI am in the process of using VB.NET to work with the Magento API. I was using SOAP v1 successfully until I ran into a call that needs an associative array. After a day or so of no luck I decided to try v2 which has all the objects I need. v2 works but is very, very slow. To update one stock item inventory it took roughly a minute and a half to login and do the update as opposed to maybe less than 10 seconds with v1. That reminded me why I chose v1 in the first place.p  pMy question is if there is anyway to improve the performance on v2. I cant imagine there is to the extent I need it but I thought Id ask. I already have caching enabled. The alternative of getting v1 to accept an associative array seems to be a challenge, if possible.p

I override the switch method to switch to a tab item that contains my low level view.p  pThen on the other tabs I implement the user control with the button.p  pThe problem I am facing is that on the first tab the button works fine, however on each subsequent tab the execute method always calls the base class method, not the derived class method.p  pI change the order of tabs it is always the first tab that works correctly and subsequent tabs that fail to call the derived method.p  pI can resolve the problem by changing the command to a RoutedCommand and then execute always calls the derived method.p  pBut I am confused as to why the delegate command does not work and why am I seeing the above behaviourp  pAny insight would be much appreciated.p  hr  pYeah I suppose code might be useful  I have added some snippets of code that might help show my intentions.p  pPlease note I have tried many different variations of this code, including using a nonstatic delegate command and using a custom delegate command not from prism but only the use of a routed command seems to workp  pbase windowp  precode    public static DelegateCommandltobjectgt SwitchToXmlOnError      public WindowBase               SwitchToXmlOnError  new DelegateCommandltobjectgtSwitchToXml, CanSwitch         this.CommandBindings.Addnew System.Windows.Input.CommandBindingSwitchToXmlOnError       protected bool CanSwitchobject e      return true   protected void SwitchToXmlobject e      this.SwitchToXmlErrorExecutee   protected virtual void SwitchToXmlErrorExecuteobject sender      To be implemented by derived class  codepre  pderived windowp  precodeprotected override void SwitchToXmlErrorExecuteobject sender      some code to change selected tab item  codepre  pbutton in user controlp  precodeltButton xNamelnkOpenXmlDocument BorderThickness0 ContentSwitch To Xml CommandinfWindowBase.SwitchToXmlOnError CommandParameterBinding XmlValidationException gt codepre  puser control implemented in other viewsp  precode                    ltappCtrlXmlErrorCtrl gt                         ltappCtrlXmlErrorCtrl.Stylegt                             ltStyle TargetTypexType appCtrlXmlErrorCtrlgt                                 ltStyle.Triggersgt                                     ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsXmlValid ValueTruegt                                         ltSetter PropertyVisibility ValueCollapsed gt                                     ltDataTriggergt                                     ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsXmlValid ValueFalsegt                                         ltSetter PropertyVisibility ValueVisible gt                                     ltDataTriggergt                                 ltStyle.Triggersgt                             ltStylegt                         ltappCtrlXmlErrorCtrl.Stylegt                     ltappCtrlXmlErrorCtrlgt codepre  pThe tab control on my main window custom tab control is merely an inherited tab control with SelectedItemChanging eventp  precodeltGridgt     ltctrlCustomTabControl xNameMainTabControl SelectionChangingMainTabControlSelectionChanging1 gt         ltctrlCustomTabItem xNameGeneralTabItem HeaderBinding GeneralTabVM.Title gt             ltScrollViewer VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt                 ltviewGeneralTabEnhancedView xNamegeneralDetailsView MinHeight650 MinWidth700 gt             ltScrollViewergt         ltctrlCustomTabItemgt         ltctrlCustomTabItem xNameSetingsTabItem HeaderBinding SettingTabVM.Title gt             ltScrollViewer VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt                 ltviewSettingsView xNamesettingsView MinHeight400  gt             ltScrollViewergt         ltctrlCustomTabItemgt         ltctrlCustomTabItem xNameXmlTabItem  DataContextBinding XMLEditorTabVM HeaderBinding Title gt             lteditorSyntaxEditor xNameMainXmlEditor                                  IsReadOnlyBinding ElementNameDataQueryView, PathIsReadOnly                                   ForegroundBlack SyntaxHighlightingXML DocumentBinding XmlDocument                                  LoadedMainXmlEditorLoaded1 UnloadedMainXmlEditorUnloaded1gt         ltctrlCustomTabItemgt     ltctrlCustomTabControlgt ltGridgt codepre

So, I faced with four kind of variablep  ol liStatic variables these are bound to memory before execution i.e., during compilation and remain bound throughout execution. li liStackdynamic variables these variables are statically bound to a type at compilation time, but they are not bound to a memory location until execution of the code reaches the declaration. li liExplicit heapdynamic variables these variables are allocated and deallocated via explicit runtime, programmerspecified instructions. The heap, not the stack, is used to provide the required memory cells. li liImplicit heapdynamic variables All the attributes for these variables, including memory cells, are bound when they are assigned a value. li ol  pMy question is about the type 2 and 4. In programming languages whose the type biding is dynamicPhp, Ruby, Python, ... all variable appears to be of type 4. p  pIs it true  All variables even the local variables are put on heap Is this a implementation thing or there is not a possibility to implement a language with dynamic type binding whose local variables are put in stack and the others in heapp

Negative 432 pI need to write a function that takes a character and a string as inputs, and then compares that character to each element in the string. It then prints an d finally returns the number of times that the said character appears in the string.p  pThis is the code Ive come up with, but it isnt working out the right way.

Metadata is encoded in JSON, and each property   in the JSON will become a property of the element itself.     There are three supported types of metadata storage       attr  Inside an attribute. The name parameter indicates which attribute.                 class Inside the class attribute, wrapped in curly braces            elem  Inside a child element e.g. a script tag. The            name parameter indicates which element.               The metadata for an element is loaded the first time the element is accessed via jQuery.     As a result, you can define the metadata type, use expr to load the metadata into the elements   matched by expr, then redefine the metadata type and run another expr for other elements.      name .metadata.setType     example ltp idone classsomeclass itemid 1, itemlabel LabelgtThis is a pltpgt   before .metadata.setTypeclass   after one.metadata.itemid  1 one.metadata.itemlabel  Label   desc Reads metadata from the class attribute      example ltp idone classsomeclass dataitemid 1, itemlabel LabelgtThis is a pltpgt   before .metadata.setTypeattr, data   after one.metadata.itemid  1 one.metadata.itemlabel  Label   desc Reads metadata from a data attribute      example ltp idone classsomeclassgtltscriptgtitemid 1, itemlabel LabelltscriptgtThis is a pltpgt   before .metadata.setTypeelem, script   after one.metadata.itemid  1 one.metadata.itemlabel  Label   desc Reads metadata from a nested script element      param String type The encoding type   param String name The name of the attribute to be used to get metadata optional   cat PluginsMetadata   descr Sets the type of encoding to be used when loading metadata for the first time   type undefined   see metadata    function   .extend     metadata           defaults               type class,             name metadata,             cre .,             single metadata         ,         setType function type, name              this.defaults.type  type             this.defaults.name  name         ,         get function elem, opts              var settings  .extend,this.defaults,opts              check for empty string in single property             if  settings.single.length  settings.single  metadata              var data  .dataelem, settings.single              returned cached data if it already exists             if  data  return data              data                if  settings.type  class                   var m  settings.cre.exec elem.className                  if  m                      data  m[1]              else if  settings.type  elem                   if elem.getElementsByTagName                      return undefined                 var e  elem.getElementsByTagNamesettings.name                 if  e.length                      data  .trime[0].innerHTML              else if  elem.getAttribute  undefined                   var attr  elem.getAttribute settings.name                  if  attr                      data  attr                           if  data.indexOf   lt0              data    data                data  eval  data                .data elem, settings.single, data              return data                    Returns the metadata object for the first member of the jQuery object.     name metadata   descr Returns elements metadata object   param Object opts An object contianing settings to override the defaults   type jQuery   cat PluginsMetadata   .fn.metadata  function opts      return .metadata.get this[0], opts    jQuery codepre

Negative 432 pIve been working a lot with Win32 lately, but Im pretty new to it, and need some advice concerning organization.  In C, although it works syntactically to declare global variables, I was always under the impression that this was sloppy, because the variable can then be modified anywhere, so it becomes much more difficult to track changes to it.  p  pIn my Win32 project, Ive got several variables which need to be modified in multiple places.  For instance, one such variable was in the WndProc function and also in a dialog procedure function.  Due to the way it was used, I was able to simply use the actual values in WndProc, and then call the dialog box using DialogBoxParam, and pass the value to the dialog box through the lParam value.p  pHowever, there are other values, such as certain bitmaps that I use for drawing or variables that are used in multiple different window message calls, where the values need to be retained throughout multiple instances of the WndProc function or multiple functions.  I can control the parameters of the functions I created, but what if I need to pass a variable into the WndProc function so that I can use it regardless of multiple different window messages  What if I need to pass in multiple values  p  pSo far Ive just been making everything global, and it works, but it feels sloppy to me...but I know that some variables are generally global as a matter of convention  like the main window and instance variables.p  pWhat do you all thinkp

Negative 432 pIm in the process of developing an automation framework using Selenium Webdriver following the PageObject pattern where there are 2 layersp  ul liTest classes Test specificationli liPageObject classes Test implementationli ul  pMy test classes contain TestNG annotation methods codeTestcode, codeBeforeTestcode, codeAfterTestcode etc where Im creating objects of the PageObject classes and calling the methods in those classes, which will actually interact with the AUT.p  pThe way Im passing data to the tests is by includingp  ul liAll the locators cssxpathclassid locators of elements in the application.li liAll the testdata neededli ul  pin a properties file For ex testDataSet1.properties. Im creating a codeHashMapltString, Stringgtcode of the properties file and passing it as a parameter to all the pageobjects which will read the data from the hashmap and use them in the script. Im not passing test data at all from the test classes.p  pWhat my problem is, I am not sure whether it is appropriate to read testdata in PageObjects. I get a feeling that this approach is very inflexible because I am tying test data to PageObjects instead of tying it to the tests. So when I need to perform datadriven tests  run the automation suite in multiple iterations, this will not work. Because, currently if I need to use different data each time I need to manually go and change the key specified in the hashmap which will fetch me a different value from the properties file. p  pAny suggestionsp

I am trying to implement codejpkottacodes answer using the variable codeisearchsearchfunfunctioncode.

Negative 432 pThis thing just seems to give me problem after problem.p  pI posted another question earlier, trying to solve the problem of retaining my session state between closing and opening through Watir. Firefox achieves this on its own, so I figured if I just set the preferences correctly, itd save my state. I ended up having to go into the codeseleniumwebdrivercode source and make some changes in order to achieve this in reality.p  pSo, I was just testing my application. Part of its behavior is to loop through a bunch of pages and extract text from them. While its looping, I simply have it in a while true loop, and figured hey, I can just stop the program with CtrlC. Well, this worked fine up to now, until it came to saving the states.p  pcodeCtrlCcode causes it not to save its state. My guess as to why is that you need to actually close the browser and I actually recreated the bug in IRB, so Im pretty sure this is the case. Simple, right Why not just use an codeensurecode block with codebrowser.closecode in it That was my first thought.p  pSo, when I try it this way, it does hit the codeensurecode block, and the codeensurecode block calls a method called codekillcode. Kill calls codebrowser.close if browser.existscode. The problem is that when it tries to execute this line, I get a nice long list of errors leading up to codeseleniumwebdrivercode. It seems as if its trying to make an HTTP request as part of its codeclosecode functionality, and is failing because, perhaps, codeCtrlCcode exited the application.p  pThe stack trace is located at a hrefhttpsgist.github.comInkybro5557085 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comInkybro5557085ap  pThe very last thing I thought was that maybe I needed to let any calls to the codebrowsercode object complete, so I placed a bunch of codetrapINT, IGNOREcode and codetrapINT, DEFAULTcode lines around these pieces of code. This also doesnt seem to do the trick.p  pIm not really emsureem as to why, which is why Im posting here. What I emthinkem needs to happen is that whatever processing is going on at the time of codeCtrlCcode needs to finish processing before codebrowser.closecode can be called. If anybody has experience with Watir andor Selenium, or even if you dont, perhaps you could help me outp

Negative 432 pI am currently thinking which implementation of PagerAdapter should I use. Ive got dilemmas connected to both of them. Let me show you what are these.p  p1 FragmentPagerAdapterp  pWorks fine, It creates new instances of fragments when none previous instances are available and retrieves previously fragments when theres such opportunity.p  pIve read recently on StackOverflow that, method codePagerAdapterscode codegetItemcode method is called ONLY when it need to create fragment, but  it is called over and over and I had to handle creating new instances and retrieving old ones inside this methods body.p  pBUT  Only few callback and lifecycle methods are called. For example I cant manage to codeonSaveInstanceStatecode to be called. So theres no way to save fragments state  of course I can use codeSharedPreferencescode or something else, but I wanted to use callback methods. Is there any way to accomplish thatp  p2 FragmentStatePagerAdapterp  pWorks perfectly, saves state of every fragment that codeViewPagercode holds.p  psBUT  this codePagerAdaptercode ALWAYS creates new fragment. I checked it inside constructor.p  pIsnt that inefficient I saw Romain Guy on Google IO materials saying that creating new codeViewscode is not efficient, especially when we creating lots of codeViewscode like in codeListViewcode so we use codeconvertViewcode to retrieve existing codeViewcode and change it for our purposes as many times as we want to. So fliping between pages is quite similar  many new codeViewscode  because fragment is a some kind of codeViewcodep  pIn both codePagerAdapterscode I tried trick with Overriding codedestroyItemcode method but It didnt work at all.sp  pAnd heres my question.p  pWhat should I dop  pShould I use codeSharedPreferencescode and option 1 with codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode or option 2 with codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercodep  pIs there any possibility, that I do something wrong within these adapters, to they behave not as we expect top  pBelow is my code divided into readable partsp  pPagerAdapter part 1p  precode   Adapter class to link WizardPager   public static class WizardCrazyAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter     implements OnPageChangeListener      public static final String tag  androidswitcherR.id.pagerw             Refernece to root activity           WizardActivity wizardActivity             list of fragments           private final ArrayListltFragmentInfogt fInfos  new ArrayListltFragmentInfogt      private short prevPageNumber  0             Constructor of adapter       param wizardActivity                  link WizardActivity as reference to activity root           public WizardCrazyAdapterWizardActivity wizardActivity          superwizardActivity.getSupportFragmentManager         this.wizardActivity  wizardActivity                      static final class FragmentInfo          private final Classltgt clss         private Bundle args          public FragmentInfoClassltgt clss, Bundle args              clss   clss             args   args                    public void addPageClassltgt clss, Bundle args         FragmentInfo fi  new FragmentInfoclss, args                  fInfos.addfi                  Return number of pages           public int getCount          return fInfos.size      codepre  pPagerAdapter part 2p  precode           Searches in link FragmentManager for link Fragment at specified position       param position       return           private AbstractWizardFragment getFragmentAtint position         FragmentManager fm  wizardActivity.getSupportFragmentManager          AbstractWizardFragment awf  AbstractWizardFragment fm.findFragmentByTagtagposition          return awf                           Return page of view pager           Override     public Fragment getItemint position          finding existing instance of fragment         AbstractWizardFragment awf  getFragmentAtposition          ifawf  null             creating new instance if no instance exist             Log.vWizardActivity, creating new Fragment             FragmentInfo fi  fInfos.getposition             awf  AbstractWizardFragment Fragment.instantiatewizardActivity, fi.clss.getName         else             Log.vWizardActivity, found existing Fragment                   return awf      codepre  pPagerAdapter part 3p  precode    Override     public void onPageSelectedint pageNumber          wizardActivity.stepFragment.setCurrentStepAndChangeTextpageNumber          ifpageNumber  prevPageNumber             AbstractWizardFragment prevFragment  AbstractWizardFragment getItemprevPageNumberTODO change if any problems             prevFragment.onDetachedFromViewPagerwizardActivity.mForm                   AbstractWizardFragment currFragment  AbstractWizardFragment getItempageNumberTODO change if any problems         currFragment.onAttachedToViewPagerwizardActivity.mForm          prevPageNumber  short pageNumber           Log.dWizardActivity, onPageSelected           Override     public Object instantiateItemViewGroup arg0, int arg1          Log.dWizardActivity, instantiateItem arg1         return super.instantiateItemarg0, arg1           Override     public void destroyItemViewGroup container, int position, Object object                super.destroyItemcontainer, position, object          Log.vWizardActivity, that would be destroy       codepre  pViewPager codep  precodepublic class WizardPager extends ViewPager     Flag to check if view pager must be scrolled    protected boolean isScrollable     Default constructor   param context link Context   public WizardPagerContext context      supercontext     isScrollable  true      Standard constructor   param context link Context   param attrs link AttributeSet   public WizardPagerContext context, AttributeSet attrs      supercontext, attrs     isScrollable  true   Override public boolean onTouchEventMotionEvent event      if this.isScrollable          return super.onTouchEventevent           return false   Override public boolean onInterceptTouchEventMotionEvent event      if this.isScrollable          return super.onInterceptTouchEventevent           return false      Enable scroll of pages   public void enableScroll     this.isScrollable  true      Disable scroll of pages   public void disableScroll     this.isScrollable  false      Check if pages can be scrolled   return   public boolean isScrollable     return isScrollable   codepre

I know it, I have put my protecting suit and I wouldnt do it If I could find any other simple way. p  pThe source text is standard python and I transform it into something else using all the runtime type manipulation available. In short, all the standard types are enhanced with metadata. Currently List is the only type which is not a leaf type and is standard.  dict is in the same category but I didnt try yet to transform it, I would likely have the same problem . Leaf types int, str, bool, float are ok, as are classes.p  pTo elegantly replace the standard list by my enhanced list datatype is one swooop, I would like to change the default behavior of the token code[]code in python text, instead of returning a list, it should return my listlike type. p  pBut I dont see any way to intercepting this token.  I can override the token codelistcode via codesys.modules[builtins]code, but code[]code seems beyond reach. p  pAny idea  p
Negative 432 pMove an EE project from Eclipse Indigo to Juno and get this error. Have anyone seen this Where should I start lookingp  pIf you need more info, just let me know.p  pbANSWER b Just want to put in the exact solution based on the suggested by Brian Vosburgh.p  pThe problem in my case is that the JPA facet does not have a JBoss runtime associated with it.

Negative 432 pa question about datetime oracle data typesp  pWe suppose that we have a codeOraclecode database.p  pWe suppose that we have a table with a field codetimestamp with timezonecode.p  pWhen I insert some rows into this table I have the codedate in ISO8601 formatcode.p  pMy server is located in strongAmericastrong.p  pMy question is p  pWhen should I remove rows that have a date that has passed, I have to consider the timezone Im wondering If I remove a row that has an expired date for the timezone of the server, this date may still be valid for other timezonesp  phow can I handle this I would like to point out that the cancellation is via cronjob on the server so always with the server side timezonep
Negative 432 pSo lets say there are two classesp  precodepublic class A      B reference  new Bthis B isnt garbage collected because A references it   public class B      A reference  A isnt garbage collected because B references it     public BA ref        reference  ref       codepre  pAnd then a third class creates a new codeAcode object. Then, when it wants to get ride of it, it sets that pointer to codenullcode. Wouldnt there be some weird persistant loop caused by A and B because they both reference each other Neither can be collected because they keep each other alive. Or is the JVM too smart for that and realizes that the rest of the program doesnt know about themp  pIt feels like this might cause some sort of memory leak.p  pIf this is possible, how do you fix it Bidirectional references are very common in code. There are many cases when object 1 knows about object 2 and object 2 knows about object 1. How do you make sure that they are deleted. p  pNOTE I wrote all this in my web browser, so forgive any errorsp

Negative 432 pDraft C14 includes both runtimesized arrays and the codestddynarraycode container.  From what I can tell, the only real difference between the two is that codestddynarraycode has an STL interface e.g., codebegincode, codeendcode, codesizecode, etc., while runtimesized arrays do not. So why does C14 need them bothp  pI understand that runtimesized arrays are part of the core language, while codestddynarraycode is part of the standard library, but a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2008n2648.htmlthe proposal for codestddynarraycodea makes clear that the authors expect compilers, in many cases, to offer special support for codestddynarraycode so that it can be as efficient as possible, i.e., as efficient as a runtimesized array. As such, the languagelibrary distinction seems somewhat artificial.p  pSo, again, why does C14 need both runtimesized arrays and codestddynarraycode  And given that codestddynarraycode has a richer STLified interface, why not just drop runtimesized arrays, assuming that codestddynarraycode can be implemented with equal runtime efficiencyp  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pWhen I talk about runtimesized arrays, Im referring to a new C14 core language feature thats described in a hrefhttpisocpp.orgfilespapersN3639.htmlN3639a, not to traditional C arrays or VLAs or anything in C11.p

Negative 432 pIm working with pulling a stream of bytes off of a medical device, and have run into a really annoying data structure. Basically, I am getting back a 2byte chunk where each bit represents a boolean value. This structure appears frequently enough in the byte stream to develop a structclass around it, but in each instance, the bits mean completely different things.p  pSo first I set up a bunch of Enums to represent all the different definitions the bit structure could have. Note that not every bit is used in every definition. Sometimes there are breaks in between the important bits.p  pstrongEDITstrong Removed all names that looked like flag. Im not using the [Flags] attribute, and this seems to be a point of contentionconfusion. The enum values are simply mapped to the indices in my BitArray.p  precodepublic enum RecordInfo  AMTEST  0, PMTEST, TESTVALIDITY  public enum RecordAlerts  ALERT1  0, ALERT2, ALERT3, ALERT4, VALIDATED  15  codepre  pThen created this container to hold the actual bitsp  precodepublic struct TwoBytesltTEnumgt where TEnum  struct, IConvertible      private BitArray bits  new BitArray2  codepre  pThis seems to work as I need, until I want to index my structure based on an Enum name. So say I have a TwoByte struct called Alerts, and this contains some bit values. If I want to get a specific flag like thisp  precodebool alert3Set  Alerts[RecordAlerts.ALERT3] codepre  pI end up with a truly heinous index function. This is what I have in place nowp  precodepublic bool this[TEnum name]      get              int index  Enum.GetValuestypeofTEnum.CastltTEnumgt.ToList.Wherex gt x.Equalsname.Castltintgt.First         return bits[index]       codepre  pNow it works, crazily enough. But that LINQ chains looks positively atrocious, and it takes a while to decipher what its actually doing. p  pIs there a cleaner, more efficient way of converting a generic Enum name to its integer value Or would I be better suited to use a Dictionary or some other object to represent the bit structure definitionsp

Negative 432 pI need to add a function from one shell script to other and launch it. Basically process should look like thisp  ol liShell script checks if a file with functions is providedli liCheck for certain function in provided fileli liIf function is available  switch to corresponding user and run this function.li ol  pProblem descriptionp  ul liBusybox Ash is used as shell interpreter.li lifunction should be called in isolated shell and should not mess up main script. li liNo code except function should be executedli liNo interaction with user should be requiredli ul  pPossible solutionsp  ul lipFirst solution is to include second file using . command. It looks like this p  precodefunctionboo su userName e c . filePath type t function if [  eq 0 ] then   su userName e c . filePath function fi codepreli ul  pHere we switch to corresponding user and include filePath in main bash script.  We also check if function is defined inside that file and if it is available, we launch it.  The problem starts when there is a code in filePath outside any functions. Ash decides to run it during every include . operation. That may potentially lead to a problem. Is there a way to import other file functions without running code itselfp  ul lipSecond solution I came out is to filter out function using sed.p  pcodesed e boo,d  filepathcodep  pcodesed e boo .[]d  filepathcodepli ul  pFirst request allows to filter function boo until closing bracket. Second one covers case when whole function is written in one line. Is there a possibility to cover all function syntax cases using one regexp p  pMay be there is an other way to solve this problemp
Negative 432 pI have a jsp page with 4 tabs. Suppose tab1,tab2,tab3,tab4. Each tab has their own buttons,button1 for tab1 and similarly button2 for tab2,button3 for tab3 and button4 for tab4.

Negative 432 pIve been rewriting an application of mine using Marionette, but Im a bit confused.p  pIn every usage Ive seen, the codeMarionette.Applicationcode object appears to just be used as a container  toplevel module which it is and nothing morep  precodeApp  new Marionette.Application  App.modulemyModule, functionargs   ...

Negative 432 pI have SQL SPs that I use to populate DataTables in VB and those to fill listboxcharts etc in VB form.  In VB I am trying to use OOP and thus use classes for variables.  In VB I have a function with the code to pull the data using a SP, this function I want to use everytime I pull data, so with every different data request you send different inputs, parameters to the function.p  pI can achieve this for input parameters which are of integer data type, however I am stuck with doing the same for DataTable type.  If I can I would like to use the same DataTable, but when you run the function again to fill another containerlistbox, then chart etc the first container loses its data and is empty, since the DataTable is loaded with new data.  This is ofcourse after the first dataset has been used to fill the first container.  Which leads me to thinking the DataTable has a permanent link to the container to keep it populatedp  pThis led me to trying to declare multiple DataTables and passing a different one for every container.  Here I get the problem to declare and pass DataTable type. Any solution to this problem  Another question is, is it possible to have a DataTable class  I use MS SQL Server 2012 amp MS Visual Studio 2010.p  pThis is how my function to fill a DataTable looksp  precodePublic Function outputDataByVal begDate, ByVal endDate, ByVal ID1, ByVal proC, ByRef dDataTable     If conn.State  ConnectionState.Open Then pData.Clear      SQLcomm  New SqlClient.SqlCommandproC, conn     SQLcomm.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure     SQLcomm.Parameters.AddWithValuebegDate, SqlDbType.Date.Value  begDate     SQLcomm.Parameters.AddWithValueendDate, SqlDbType.Date.Value  endDate     SQLcomm.Parameters.AddWithValueID1, SqlDbType.Int.Value  ID1       aDapter.SelectCommand  SQLcomm     aDapter.FilldDataTable      Return pData  End Function codepre  pproC is the SQL procedure parameter, dDataTable the DataTable parameter.

Negative 432 pIm having trouble with a hrefhttpsgithub.comairbladepapertrail relnofollowPaperTraila autoversioning of objects for Rails being used with RSpec tests. Normally I want my tests to run without PaperTrail versioning, but there are a handful of tests for which I want PaperTrail turned on. I typically run my tests with Guard and Spork, and I can use things like codePaperTrail.enabled  truecode and codePaperTrail.enabled  falsecode around a given test and everything works fine.p  pHowever, when I run the tests with RSpec, the tests requiring PaperTrail fail. To be more specific, it appears that while code in codebeforecode filters can produce versions objects, code in the tests cannot. After a considerable amount of digging and tinkering and trying code snippets Ive tried a hrefhttpteamcoding.comblogselectivepapertrailinrspec relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comairbladepapertrailturningpapertrailoffon relnofollowthisa, it looks like the best solution is to use the coderequire papertrailframeworksrspeccode line mentioned in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comairbladepapertrailspork relnofollowPaperTrail READMEa.p  pUnfortunately, each of these keeps me right where I startedtests pass with GuardSpork but not vanilla RSpec. This is in particular an issue because while I use Spork locally, our continous integration server runs RSpec directly.p  pDoes anyone have any insightp

And thus the data produced is not compressed AND then immediately the original file is DELETED leaving me with nothing If it was compressed it would have been ok. There are currently 5 running jobs in such a state. I need to divert this behavior somehow so that I dont loose 5 days work. I am thinking to  create a fake script named datacompress in the current directory to change the behavior of the running program. Can I do this or are there better options, if at all The program is about to finish in less than an hour so it is urgent. p

Negative 432 pThis is the question from my assignment that I am unsure ofp  pThe class is to contain a public method nextWord. When a new line is read, use the String method .splits to create an array of the words that are on the line. Each call to the nextWord method is to return the next word in the array. When all of the words in the array have been processed, read the next line in the file. The nextWordmethod returns the value null when the end of the file is reached. p  pI have read the file, and stored each individual string in an array called tokenz.p  pIm not sure how I can have a method called nextWord which returns each individual word from tokenz one at a time.

Then write a loop that obtains one word at a time from the MyReader class using the nextWord method and prints each word on a new line.p  pIve thought of ways to do this but Im not sure how to return each word from the nextWord method im supposed to write.

Negative 432 pAlright, let me try to explain.p  pI have an application where I can trigger some sort of scan process. This scan process launches just a number 10 background workers which do something. After again, just a number 5 seconds I would like top  ul liKill all the background workers Im using CancelAsync for thatli liDo some calculation with the data I got from all of themli liUpdate the UI so the data is displayed AND enable some buttons these buttons are bound through a codeViewModelcode Command called codePerformUpdateCommandcode and they have a codeCanExecutecode property of codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode. The codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode dependency property is set when my tasks finish.li ul  pWhat I thought I would dop  ul liAfter triggering the Background Workers, start a dispatcher timer with a 5 second interval. li liWhen the codeDispatcherTimercode ticks I calculate the data and set the property codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode to either true or false.li ul  pThis basically works as expected the UI stays responsive, ... with just a minor hickup The UI is not being updated the button is not enabled. As soon as I put the window into the background and back into the foreground, the command is enabled, also the codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode property is set to true. Also, when I press the button in disabled state after pressing it, it will be enabled.p  pSo, although I set the dependency property correctly, the UI does not react to this change. p  pAnybody knows why Interestingly, I also set some text in the UI into a label  this text is updated correctly. Its just that the property which tells the command codeCanExecutecode does not trigger a UI update.p  pCode for the initialization of the timer.p  precode        scanTimer  new DispatcherTimer         scanTimer.Interval  new TimeSpan0, 0, 0, 3         scanTimer.Tick  delegate                       After the timer has elapsed some time passed, cancel all scans and update the result             scanTimer.Stop             UpdateScanResults             CancelNormalScansfalse                  scanTimer.Start codepre  pCode how the Command is bound to the WPF element the button is actually a Hyperlinkp  precode            ltLabel Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1gt                 ltHyperlink CommandBinding ReadSettingsCommandgt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding SourceStaticResource Loc, PathLabels.ReadSettingsgtltTextBlockgt                 ltHyperlinkgt             ltLabelgt codepre  pHere is the code for the Commandp  precode    public RelayCommand ReadSettingsCommand              get                      return readSettingsCommand                  readSettingsCommand  new RelayCommandExecuteReadSettings,  gt IsScannedDeviceAvailable ampamp IsUpdateInProgress               codepre  pThe code is actually dependent on two dependency properties IsScannedDeviceAvailable AND NOT IsUpdateInProgress. Both are dependency properties.p  pUPDATE I just read that the binding to the CanExecute property is just one time. If you want it to revalidate you need to call RaiseCanExecuteChanged on the command. This works, but it is somewhat cumbersome, since now I need to call it manually every time one of the two properties change. Actually I wanted that to be handled automatically. Any ideas on how this can be done more easily Isnt there some method to have kind of a oneway binding between CanExecute and the propertyp

That is to say a new tab and content shows, which is great, but since the code.navtabscode dont update two things occurp  ol liThe wrong tab is active.li liThe active code.navcode link doesnt work. So say I went from tab codehrefnavacode to tab codehrefnavbcode but from a link in the main content and not in the code.navtabscode the link for codenavacode stays active and not clickable, preventing me from returning to it.li ol  pShould I be using codedataspycode or something like thatp  pAnd if Ive been unclear, let me know. I can provide a link to the site in question if that would help.p
Negative 432 pWe have a java webapplication that allows authentication via LDAP.  Basically, it follows this processp  ul liBind to the directory with an admin user that has rights to search the directory.li liTakes a usernamevalue and searches the directory for a user that has that usernamevalue in a particular attribute.li liBinds with the user that is found with the password that was entered.li liIf the bind is successful we grant login.li ul  pThis works well, but we have recently come across environment where the LDAP user logging in, does not have access to browse the directory itself. This causes an error when binding. The admin user binds correctly, and searches the directory. It is only the final bind with the found user that fails.p  pInternal logging from the LDAP directory CA Directory shows that the bind function is successful, but as part of the bind process, the bound user is looking itself up.. which it doesnt have access to do. This causes the bind to fail.p  pThe bind to LDAP is done with this java code.. p  precode        Properties props  new Properties         props.putContext.INITIALCONTEXTFACTORY, com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory         props.putContext.PROVIDERURL, createLDAPString                props.putContext.SECURITYAUTHENTICATION, simple         props.putContext.SECURITYPRINCIPAL, username         props.putContext.SECURITYCREDENTIALS, password          return new InitialLdapContextprops, null  codepre  pIs there a way to stop the internal lookup from occurringp  pOr is there way that I can validate a userpassword without binding ie. Binding on behalf of another user.. or comparing passwords manually which doesnt sound great.p  pThanks.p

Negative 432 pI have recently added Jeff Wilcoxs PhoneThemeManager to my app, which works great, although I am having problems changing the application bar buttons to the color I wish to use. My app design specifications require using the Light Theme. The problem I am having is that when the device is already in light theme, upon application loading the appbar foreground is the correct color because the PhoneThemeManager does not overwrite any values, although when in dark theme the appbar foreground values are black which mimics the default foreground settings in the light theme.p  pAccording to his website, If you have code in your app like var ab  new ApplicationBar, beware that that application bar will take on the systems actual theme colors by default, and not the overridden lightdark coloring that happens with the app.p  pIf you need to new up an ApplicationBar, you should use the convenience method of codeThemeManager.CreateApplicationBarcode or use the extension method on app bar that I added, codeMatchOverriddenThemecode, to set the color values.p  pIm not sure how to implement this to get custom appbar button colors.p  pIve done the followingp  precodepublic App   Global handler for uncaught exceptions.

Negative 432 pI have an IBAction connected to a UIButton, which when pressed calls an HTTPS POST request method. The method is called and the request is made, the server responds and everything is dandy.p  pThe problem that I am having is very peculiar. I launch the app, and I hit my button. The request is made once. I hit it again, and the request fires twice, I hit it again and the request fires three times, and so on and so forth. I continued up to 20 POST requests made with a single button pressp  pI set breakpoints to see if the method was being called more than once, and the breakpoint only showed one. But, then I put in a log to log the request, and that showed me that it was repeating, but for some unknown reason.p  pI have no loops that I can see, no NSTimers, or any reason for this to be happening.

After this POST request, there is a response from the server which triggers an NSNotification. The selector that the NSNotification observer calls, is the POST request that is being repeated. Setting breakpoints shows that it does get called multiple times. Why are the notifications stacking up How do I keep it from being called more than oncep

Negative 432 pI have a navigation menu that is positioned relative to other elements in my code. When you view this navigation menu in a browser that has a minimum width of 200px max 767px, and open the navigation menu, all of the content is pushed down, which is good, as you can view all of the content, however, if you start to scroll down with the menu open, the page content jumps upward at least 400 pixels not allowing anyone to read 14 of the content on the page.p  pI have a script that makes this navigation menu stick to the top of the browser, and when I turn off that script and repeat the above actions everything is fine the content doesnt jump etc. The only problem then is that the navigation menu no longer sticks to the the top of the page, and when the nav menu is opened it does not push any content down, it gets covered up by the expanding navigation menu.p  pI have attached a working fiddle that replicates the issue. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nety7Cgg1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nety7Cgg1ap  pAny remedy for this scenariop  pScriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction     this.scrollTop0   window.scrollfunction      if window.scrollTop gt 36               .mobilenavcontainer.cssposition fixed           else               .mobilenavcontainer.cssposition relative, top 3px       codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idmainimage2gtltdivgt  ltMOBILE NAVIGATION MENUgt ltdiv classmobilenavcontainergt ltdiv idmainlogomobilegtlta hrefindex.htmlgtltimg srcimagesmobilelogo.svg width32px alt3Elements Review, a literary journal based in Chicago, Illinois.

Negative 432 pI have an RSA x509 certificate that I want to use in a C program.p  pIve done some research and apparently I need to import two things using RSAParameters The modulus, and the exponent.p  pAll I know how to use is a key block like the one above, how do I take a key block and get the modulus and exponent I tried MSDN but the documentation doesnt say much.p  pAlso, those two fields are supposed to be in codebyte[]code format, can I convert them directly I have a method codeUtility.ToByteArraycode or do they need to be encoded in a certain way first.p  pThanksp

Negative 432 pIn my business logic, I have a user, a company users can be part of the company, as employees,  i would call them agents and products. p  pA product can be owned by a user or by a company, the company can assign it to a user agent later, but it would still be owned by the company in case the company fires the agent. p  pMy thought is to have the user table, the company table and the product table and a table to track who is the owner of the productp  precode    users          userid     name            products    productid    title           company     companyid    name             agents      agentid      userid     companyid     productowner        id          productid     userid        companyid   agentassigned  codepre  pIf the product is owned by a user then only productid and userid will be filled. If its owned by a company, then productid, companyid and agentassigned would be filled. p  pLater, I would want to pull a product, and know whos the owner the user info, or the agent and company info.p  pIs this the best way to do it It doesnt seem that good to me. p

Negative 432 pI have two models Portfolio and PortfolioPic.  PortfolioPic belongsto Portfolio and Portfolio hasmany portfoliopics.

For example, If at first I create two images, A and B, and then I try to update A and B, the database will contain two different As and two different bs.

Negative 432 pIm making use of storing random token values into session as well as flash message which prints out messages for one time only upon registration of updating profile,, this is working so far like it should on the localhost  wampserver. However, after deploying the website to the live server the process works correctly as long as the user is not logged in, after I log in I just cant update the profile at all, also after a successful registration the message you have been registered successfully is shown every time I go to the the homepage while it should only appear once and only once.. and  again on the local server it is working like charm.p  pSo after checking some online resources the answer was it mostly the configuration of php.ini on the server is what causing the problem, so I checked the php.ini on the server and after comparing it to the local one i found these two line missing concerning the Session fieldp  precodesession.savepath  cwamptmp session.useonlycookies  1 codepre  pThen I added them to the online version of php.ini and it still doesnt work, of course Ive changed the savepath to some random value but the whole storing in session doesnt work at all until i comment the codesession.savepathcode line, the other line didnt change anything so I dont know where the problem is.p  pThanks in advance.p

Players can interact with the map by moving spacecraft to each sector and colonising as desired.p  pSo, part of my model layer looks like this Im oversimplifying here just to be briefp  precodefunction Map        An array of Sectors     this.sectors  []     . . .   function Sector        Array of Planets     this.planets  []       Array of player built space stations     . . .     this.spaceStations  []   function Planet        Array of player built buildings     this.structures  []     . . .  codepre  pThe game currently has two views, a MapView which renders the visible universep  precodefunction MapView        param map The game Map object     this.render  functionmap           this.canvas  new Canvas           Camera can examine the Map to find the part that is currently visible on screen         this.camera  new Camera         . . .          foreachmap.sectors as sector               LOTS of code and drawImage commands here to . . .             ask camera if each sector is in currently in view no point drawing the entire map             draw each sector background image star field or nebula or whatever helps make the game look more natural             draw sector boundary lines so we end up with a nice nasty grid over the whole map             determine what planet sprite image to draw depending on planet type i.e ROCK, EARTH, GAS             draw every planet in each sector the player can watch these planet sprites orbit their sun             draw any player created structures in each sector             draw any ships currently in each sector                codepre  pand a ExamineSectorView, which renders a selected sectorp  precodefunction ExamineSectorView        param sector A game Sector object     this.render  functionsector           this.canvas  new AnotherCanvas         . . .         notsomuchbutgrowingsuspiciouslylargeamountofcode here to . . .          foreach  draw planets in currently selected sector selected from Map           draw space stations          you get the idea       codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvbFMj.png altviewsp  pI just have one controller right now, MapController. It creates Event listeners on the keyboardmouse so that the player can interact with the Map, i.ep  ul liplayer clicks on a sector in MapView  view that sector in the ExamineSectorViewli liplayer uses the arrow keys  scroll the map camera.li ul  pAt startup, the controller calls methods on the Map to generate it, creates the views and starts a setInterval timer for view rendering.p  pWhat I would like help with is my two views.p  pI feel that they are both doing far too much.p  pThey do contain logic, but it is viewrelevant stuff only and required for the render  like a 10switch statement to determine a planet type and draw the appropriate image or a little multiplication of a planets .size property to work out how big to draw it. So I think that logic is in the correct place, in the view.p  pThe trouble is that all this viewspecific logic adds up to a lot. My view is getting out of hand and would like to separate the rendering of each aspect of the views somehow. For example, like thisp  precodefunction MapView       this.render  function           this.canvas  new Canvas           Camera can examine the Map to find the part that is currently visible on screen         this.camera  new Camera         . . .         foreachmap.sectors as sector              mapSectorView  new MapSectorView            mapSectorView.rendersector                function MapSectorView       this.render  functionsector           this.canvas  new Canvas          . . .         foreachsector.planets as planet              planetView  new MapSectorPlanetView            planetView.renderplanet                function MapSectorPlanetView       this.render  functionplanet           this.canvas  new Canvas          . . .         foreachplanet.structure as structure              structureView  new StructureView            structureView.renderstructure                . . . codepre  pIve read other posts on this site that state views should not create one another. If so, an alternative to the above would be to create all required views in the controller and start passing them around i.ep  precodemapView.rendermapModelObject, mapSectorView, mapPlanetView codepre  pIm not too sure that is the way to solve this issue either.p  pI can imagine this game is going to get big fairly quickly and I know the view will get much more complex as I develop the game so Id appreciate any advice on how to manage rendering in a MVC game like this, especially regarding separation of concerns in a JScanvas environment.p  pI just found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions475129mvcdatamodelsandviewmodelsrq1MVC Data Models and View Modelsap  pIm wondering if that is a possible solution here create some viewmodels i.e MapViewModel that holds all the views it needs and renders each one.p  pThanksp

Negative 432 pI did a test against a WCF server where the response from the server exceeds the codeMaxRecievedMessageSizecode property defined in the clientside binding object, resulting in a codeCommunicationExceptioncode. I examined request and response using a hrefhttpfiddler2.com relnofollowFiddlera. Despite exceeding the codeMaxRecievedMessageSizecode, the entirety of the response is sent to the client.p  pI believe I am missing the point of this behavior. As I see it, no bandwidth is saved as the data has already been received. The client application could have processed the data but the client binding has discarded before it is given to the application.p  pIf saving bandwidth is not the purpose of the MaxReceivedMessageSize on the clientside, what is it forp

Negative 432 pI use adjustPan to automatically pan my application to make the EditText field visible when the softkeyboard appears. So far this has worked well but in the latest Android 4.4 Kitkat versions the actionbar pans up as usual but a white box is left behind. Ive tried debugging this with the Eclipse View Hierarchy tool but it ignores the box. Ive also experimented with v19 styling with no luck. This happens on a variety of Kitkat Nexus devices and emulators.p  pIm happy to leave the actionbar on screen or remove it completely when the windows pans. Any help would be appreciated removing the box.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6v2YY.png altenter image description herep

Negative 432 pI know how to program, but i want to become a better programmer. I have certain classes that are more IO oriented. One takes in a url with a macro, some page numbers, and an downloader interface, an some xpath to combine many htmls into one managable xml. p  pThe problem comes in my mind is, do i let the end user access the methods that do the work, or do i make the class have one single run method Or do i leave the class as is, with no run method, and add a method to a utility class that simply constructs the object and returns its ultimate value.p  pmaking a class with a single public method feels wrong, but on the other hand, making a bunch of public methods that could be relied on, and therefore kill my ability to refactor also feels wrong.p

Negative 432 pIm creating a home automation android application with my arduino uno and HC05 Bluetooth Module. Everything works fine already. It can scan, connect, onoff bluetooth, control the bulb on and off using buttons and switch control but with a bad and plain design of the application. So I decided to use a Tab Widget. The problem is that when I change something it wont run and shows a NullPointerException problem and I dont have any idea why ots happening since its already a working app for this past few days.p

Negative 432 pFirst of all, excuse me if my english isnt perfect, but Im not from a english speaking country Spain, so...p  pWell, heres the question. When creating a class, is a good practice to use temporary variables all you can, or is better to declare your variables as class variables, just in order to keep things clearp  pIll give you an example, using a simple class SpriteSheet. Is a very short and popular class, used almost in every 2D game out there in Java.p  pHere is the code just as it originally was planned by the creator of the tutorial I was watchingp  precodepublic class SpriteSheet   private String path private final int SIZE public int[] spriteSheetPixels  public SpriteSheetString path, int size  this.path  path SIZE  size  spriteSheetPixels  new int[SIZE  SIZE]  load   private final void load  try      BufferedImage image  ImageIO.readSpriteSheet.class         .getResourcepath     int w  image.getWidth     int h  image.getHeight     image.getRGB0, 0, w, h, spriteSheetPixels, 0, w  catch IOException e      e.printStackTrace   codepre  pp  pPoint is, he is doing just a normal class, following all Java conventions as far as I know. After having a look at it, I thought I could improve it a little bit. Here is my version of the very same classp  precodepublic final class SpriteSheet   public final int[] spriteSheetPixels  public SpriteSheetfinal String path, final int width, final int height  spriteSheetPixels  new int[width  height]  loadpath, width, height   private final void loadfinal String path, final int width, final int height  try      BufferedImage image  ImageIO.readSpriteSheet.class         .getResourcepath      final int w  image.getWidth     final int h  image.getHeight     final byte ZERO  0      image.getRGBZERO, ZERO, w, h, spriteSheetPixels, ZERO, w  catch IOException e      e.printStackTrace   codepre  pp  pJust in case, if you dont feel like paying too much attention, Ill try to resume what Ive changed and why  Added final to class declaration, as I dont think Ill ever need to instantiate it.  Removed all class variables except for the array, as it is the only thing Ill end up using from this class. I feel like having the rest of the variables declared as class variables is just a waste of memory. If theyre temporary, if Im not mistaken, theyll be used and then the GC will take care of them sooner or later, freeing memory.  Marked the array as final because itll stay as it is for the rest of runtime.  Split the SIZE constant into width and height, just in case I decide using some non square sprite sheets.  Declaring w and h is actually a good think, as calling methods in the parameters is usually bad for execution speed or thats what Ive read in some places.  As 0 is used several times, I believe declaring it as a variable will help to improve the execution speed just a tiny little bit, probably wont be noticeable anyway.p  pAnd thats basically all of it. Be aware Im a studient and probably Im making some very n00b mistakes, and thats why I wanted to ask here, as Im sure there are lots of experienced programmers around.p  pBare in mind I dont really care about the SpriteSheet class, Im more curious about the quality of my optimisations.p  pDid I improved things or make them worst making things actually slower, less readable, harder to maintain in the future, doing things that the compiler will do anyways...p  pSorry if my question is too long and too vague, is my first one so, easy on me p  pThanks in advance.p  pEDITp  pI just read it after a little break, and it doesnt make any sense have you seen that Im parsing width and height parameters to load and never use themp  pHere is as I believe it should bep  precodepublic final class SpriteSheet   public final int[] spriteSheetPixels  public SpriteSheetfinal String path, final int width, final int height  final byte ZERO  0 spriteSheetPixels  new int[width  height]  try      BufferedImage image  ImageIO.readSpriteSheet.class         .getResourcepath      image.getRGBZERO, ZERO, width, height, spriteSheetPixels, ZERO,         width  catch IOException e      e.printStackTrace   codepre  pp  pJust realized I dont need the method really.

Negative 432 pIf you declare in CSS something is codedisplay nonecode, does the browser download the data anywayp  pI always had the impression that it does. My understanding is that when downloading a web page, the browser pulls down everything from the server, and then it reads the CSS, and then displays or doesnt display what the CSS specifies. So, if you have a bunch of images in a codeDIVcode, and you set that codeDIVcode to codedisplay nonecode the images still get downloaded, just not rendered.p  pThis being the case, then if a responsive website has huge images to display for a widescreen monitor, and if someone views that page on their mobile phone, then they are still downloading those huge images, but just cant see them. This is kind of a burn for people who pay for data transfer rates, not to mention the additional time it takes to download the content, holding the user up.p  pAm I wrong about this Are responsive web sites in some way saving people on lower spec devices from downloading content they wont see Without resorting to browser detection and code on the server to determine what content to send, is there a methodology in CSS that addresses the downloading of unneeded datap

Negative 432 pIn one of our app, we have to list around a million records that are stored in an internal sqlite database and show them in a list view separated by multiple list view UI layouts. p  pFor example, the list will look like    p  precodeArea 1        Location A           Person 1           Person 2           Person 3        Location B            Person 4           Person 5 Area 2        Location C           Person 6           Person 7           Person 8        Location D            Person 9           Person 10 codepre  pand so on...p  pNow, the Areas are in hundreds, the Locations are in thousands in number and Persons are in millions. Area, Location amp Person are models tables with multiple attributes attached to them. Ive to use 3 different list item layout for Area, Location amp Person records.p  pIve used a hrefhttpsgithub.comcommonsguycwacendless relnofollowEndless Adapter from CWACa with custom BaseAdapter in my implementation. Im fetching and storing the Areas amp Locations in ArrayList and Ive delegated the fetching of Person records to Endless Adapter. It is working as expected but as the number of records for Persons keep growing which is normal in the app, the list view generation is getting slow daybyday. Other than that there are filters that come into play to filter the area, location amp persons. So for each filter the query for fetching the area, the location as well as the person changes. And we also have Search feature in the app where the user can search for a particular area, location or a person and the list view refreshes the data accordingly. p  pIm not allowed to show the actual records and source code which would have helped in understanding the complex data in a better way, Sorryp  pIs there any embetterem way to do this and improve the user experience and save users time Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers488241squonkSquonka  The users can actually edit the records of Persons at any given point in time like changing their location, names, birthdate, etc. The users can also change the Location that they want to pursue. For example, a user can store New York amp London for hisher preference even if the app has multiple other Locations for himher to choose. Once the user selects the Location heshe will be able to see the Persons available on those Locations. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers518159tophyrtophyra  The EndlessAdapter helps me to fetch 30 records at a time for a given Area amp Location which I keep it in memory for display. Once the user scrolls and last record is reached, the EndlessAdapter refreshes and my data in the memory refreshes too. As soon as there are no Person records left, I alter the query to get the next Location and the EndlessAdapter starts fetching the Person records based on the new query. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers115145commonswareCommonsWarea  Yes, the millions records are not stored in devices RAM but they have to be searched, filtered and shown to the user and for this, I use your awesome library. I may be guilty of implementing it in the wrong way and thats why I seek help in improving it.p

Negative 432 pImagine a codeUIWebViewcode that is partly overlayed by a codeUIViewcode which itself has to receive touches. p  pAll I want to do is forward the touch events from the overlaying codeUIViewcode to the codeUIWebViewcode. I tried subclassing the codeUIViewcode and forward the touches to codeUIWebViewcode like p  precode[webview touchesbegantouches withEvent event]  codepre  pbut it isnt working. p  pWell, it works as far as I can see by subclassing the codeUIWebViewcode that codetouchesbegancode gets called.

Negative 432 pI am using hibernate lucene search4.5.1 in my application in the cloud environment. For each tenant a separate hibernate configuration is maintained all the properties are same except codehibernate.search.default.indexBasecode property. Each tenant has separate filesystem location. While starting the application I made the logic to index some table data by unique location for each tenant eg ddbindextenant1, ddbindextenant2 by calling the method codeSearch.getFullTextSessionsession.createIndexer.startAndWaitcode. For the first tenant every thing is fine, index was perfectly done. For the second tenant the startAndWait is not completed. It doesnt comes out from the codestartAndWaitcode but some time it is working. Some time doesnt comes out from the codestartAndWaitcode. After a serious debugging I found that codeBatchIndexingWorkspacecode has two thread producer and consumer where producer take the list of Id from DB and put it in queue and Consumer takes and indexes it. At the producer side IdentifierProducer a method named codeinTransactionWrappercode has a statement p  precodeTransaction transaction  Helper.getTransactionAndMarkForJoin session  transaction.begin codepre  pThe statement codetransaction.begincode gets hangs and transaction doesnt begins so producer is not produced so consumer didnt indexed and startAndWait freezes. After a long search some post says that pool size will make a dead lock. But I am using codeBoneCPConnectionProvidercode with codemaxConnectionsPerPartitioncode with 50 per tenant. I monitored the active connection while starting, it doesnt exceed 10. More connection are available. But I dont know what is the problem.p

Negative 432 pI have a Django application that allows web visitors to create there own accounts. Once they create an account with a passwords, they should receive and email containing activation code. When a webvisitor creates a new account, they need to receive an activation email containing a unique key. p  pObviously, I can do all this using Djangos builtin authentication system. Ive done it before without any problems. However, in this application, I dont want to pollute my Users table with inactive users. I only want activated users to appear in the Users table. So although I will use Djangos account system for authenticating activated users, until they become activated, Im rolling my own system. Im keeping all the data about notyetactivated users in a separate Django Model object called codeUserActivationcode. And I will be managing the sending of the activation email myself.p  pThe problem Im having is that I dont want to store the usersubmitted password in Plain text. I want to store it in my UserActivation object in a field called password in the same hashedformat it would appear in the User table.

How can I get this same value and stuff it into codeUserActivation.passwordcodep  pFrom looking at a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.4topicsauth relnofollowstrongthisstronga doc, it seems that there is a codemakepasswordcode function that returns the value that I need.

Negative 432 pI have implemented the method of graph construction from image. This method is based on KNN.p  pBasically, each pixel represents a vertex, and it is necessary to connect each pixel with the k nearest neighbors.p  pThe script is simple, but is very slow. I tried to optimize the calculation of the Euclidean distance and the step to add edges.p  pSomeone has any suggestions to optimize my codep  pThe slowest step is the calculation of the Euclidean distance. This distance is coden2code, due to compute the distance of all vertices for all.

I do not yet see any difference with the scripts where mails are sent correctly and the scripts where mail headers get corrupted.

Negative 432 pLet me begin by saying that I am very new to Microsofts Internet Information Service. I need to setup IIS on my PC and it should also execute PHP files.

If I try to request any PHP files, I get 403 error. p  pI have been researching online and seems to be more confused about setting up PHP extension on IIS. Some websites say you need to configure PHP through its MANAGER. Others say I need to add Role and FastCGImodule through IIS manager. According to Microsoft I need to rename php.inidevelopment to php.ini and point php to some DLL file.p  pI am using Windows 8, IIS 8.5 and PHP 5.6. I hope someone could point me in the direction.p

This happens if the facesinitialization does not work at all  make sure that you properly include all configuration settings necessary for a basic faces application and that all the necessary libs are included. Also check the logging output of your web application and your container for any exceptions If you did that and find nothing, the mistake might be due to the fact that you use some special webcontainers which do not support registering contextlisteners via TLD files and a context listener is not setup in your web.xml.

Negative 432 pIf a[,] is a multdimensional array in C, does a[0,1] or a[1,0] come immediately after a[0,0] in memory.

Negative 432 pI am ordering products from a supplier using cURL.  I have a choice of receiving the orders by email, fairly straight forward, or via HTTP.  I want to use the HTTP delivery method to get the files delivered into a directory on my webserver.  I have asked the supplier to tell me more about the requirements for the HTTP and they are unable to give detail.  This suggests that it is something that can be setup entirely at my side, or they are not being forthcoming with information i will need.  I have asked them for examples of what other people have provided for the HTTP parameter and they have given me some examples.  Apparently most people have specified a URL to file level and not just directory level.  E.g. a hrefhttpwww.domain.co.ukdirectorylistenLandmark.asmx relnofollowhttpwww.domain.co.ukdirectorylistenLandmark.asmxa  or .aspx or .ashx.  there are also some .php which is good as that is what i want to use.  Howeever, some have just given a directory level parameter.p  pI guess that if I use a php file, I will be able to handle the files delivered rather than just have to check manually to see if there is anything there.p  pCan somebody tell me what I need to do to get this started please.  The supplier is getting a 500 server error when trying to sendpost file to me.  I have tried changing the permissions on a directory to allow public read and write and execute, but this has changed nothing and is presumably very bad practice anyway .p  pIf somebody can give me a quick push in the right direction i would appreciate it or is it the case that i need more information from the supplier before i can begin.p

Negative 432 pI am having some issues with a third level nested viewroute using uirouter. I am essentially developing a site admin panel for all the sites I manage. on the tools page you first have to select an environment which populates the sites view and dropdown box once a site is selected you should get the selected view and panel which will contain all the site specific info. The issue I am having is the selected panel shows up when the sites panel shows up without having selected a site yet. p  pMy real question is this what is the proper way to setup multiple nested views using uirouter do all the view get specified under each state also is it ok to change the URL with a view change or should the url only be altered during a state change. I think I am mixing up states and views. I know that what I really want is a tools statepage with multiple views one for each set of options.p  peven if someone could just provide some links to good tutorials on nested views and routes using uirouter that would be awesome.p  pI will try to setup a plunker to demonstrate what I am trying to do, but it has proved difficult so far being that I started with ngboilerplate for this projectp

Negative 432 pI need to replace a cross domain iframe with the html it contains. I can add html and javascript to both domains. I know this should be possible, since youtube seems to do something similar with the comment section. I would just need to do the same. If nothing else works, could this also be done using postMessage or I could use something like document.domainp  p... okay, since the site didnt let me post the question, I have to write something more I guess. I need this because I have to create a script to autoload youtube comments, since they dont load at ALL on older browsers. I tried using iframes to embed the same thing youtube originally does. But since the content is retrieved from apis.google.com, I had a lot of trouble trying to make it resize itself like it should be. A lot of solutions seem to not work on older browsers, but thats why I need this in the first place. I noticed in firebug how the comments dont seem to open in an iframe, even though I was sure they did. I could even open the frame itself sometime ago, thats how I got the URL the comments are called from. Now only that sites html can be seen there, embedded inside the container. I would be grateful if anyone finally gave a solution.p

Negative 432 pIm trying to get boost fiber up and running on os x, and Im having quite a few issues.  First, fiber wont compile with Apple clang because of the use of codethreadlocalcode which Apple does not support according to what I found online, they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and dont want to introduce it only to break ABI later.p  pSo instead, I tried using gcc5 installed through homebrew. After a bit of screwing around with boost build I managed to get fiber to build, and I can link sample programs successfully, but they seg fault.p  pThen I figured Id give current llvm a try, since it has threadlocal support, and I can again get boost fiber to build fine, but now Im getting issues because the os x linker doesnt seem to handle thread local properly either  I would post the exact error, but my power is out.  I did actually get it to link though with a couple changes to fiber, but the sample program failed again.p  pSo the question is, how can I make this happen Is there any way to get another linker working to produce os x executables for me Llvm comes with another linker called lld, but I dont think it does what Im after.p  pI think if I absolutely had to, I could go through fiber and boost context replacing all threadlocal with boostthreadspecificptr, but Im not sure how deep that rabbit hole goes.  Any suggestions p

Negative 432 pI am reading about the Abstract Factory Pattern.  As far as I understand, the client code is going to have references to the constructed objects via the abstract interface.

Why have all these subclasses when the client wont even be able to access any new methods or variablesp

Negative 432 pI think my title says it all. I am running a software on a NIOS2 processor on an Altera FPGA. Is there some way to detect which is the FPGA that the software is running onp  pTo answer the question in the comment Why do I care which FPGA I am on For production we use a design with EPCS controller to program everything. This programming flow is not sensitive to Quartus versions, unlike the .jic flow using Quartus programmer.  Unfortunately, for new EPCQ devices you have to correctly program the nonvolatile register of the EPCQ with the proper wait states and addressing mode so that the FPGA will configure correctly. The NIOS shell tools dont have the capability to do that Quartus programmer with .jic flow does it so I wrote a small piece of software that does that.  There is a table in the EPCQ datasheet that says what the wait states should be according to FPGA family and size of EPCQ. Size of EPCQ I can ask the EPCQ. FPGA family I dont know who to ask. Thus, now for each project I have its personal piece of software with data hard coded to FPGA type. I want the software to be generic and not FPGA specific thus I need to know which FPGA I am on.p

Negative 432 pIm writing a sort of complex large app, where by definition theres not a whole lot of structure. Theres tons of random elements with random colors, sizes, etc. So, writing css selectors that can be applied to many elements is kind of difficult. p  pEach element will need a set of CSS properties applied to it, so the question then becomes how to structure that CSS. Ive began to think that it might be more efficient to declare a bunch of selectors that only have one property each, which could be used throughout the application, like so p  pCSSp  precode.bgred    backgroundcolor red   .inline    display inlineblock   .width50px    width 50px   .borderbottom    borderbottom 1px solid black  codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idmydiv classbgred inline width50px borderbottomgtltdivgt codepre  pWhere as traditionally, I would probably dop  precodemydiv    backgroundcolor red   display inlineblock   width 50px   borderbottom 1px solid black  codepre  pWhich seems like the normal way to declare elements. p  pButIve found that, for example, I was redeclaring properties like codedisplay inlineblockcode very, very often, so it seemed like it instead of declaring codeinlineblockcode in a bunch of selectors, I could just have a selector that has a single declaration of codeinlineblockcode which then could be a class that I could apply to all elements that need to be declared that way.p  pIt therefore puts me at a middle ground, where I could have tons of selectors that each have one property and each HTML element is flooded with classes with one property each. Or, I could go the traditional route and have a selector that has a bunch of properties that should apply to an element. p  pPerformance wise, which is the better option Using selectors that have one property means that the same properties wont have to be declared repeatedly, but it also means that the parser may have to run through the HTML more to find the correct elements to apply properties to. p  pCouldnt find much information on this so any general advice is appreciated. p

Negative 432 pAn array A of N integers and one integer K. Count number of nonempty contiguous sub sequences of A, such that there are no bad pairs of integers in this sub segment.

Negative 432 pI have been researching a way to dynamically add a table row, then a set of 3 cells, each containing an image which is pulled from a directory.

The reason why I need to fill the matrix is because in my program I am then using it for various calculations I am inverting it, I am multiplying it with other matrices...and it seems to me that in order to perform these various calculations you do need to actually store the full matrix, you cant use for example only half of that but I may be wrong, in which case please tell me how I should do.p  pThe problem is that such a matrix is simply too big for my computer and I get the following errorp  precodeTraceback most recent call last     File program.py, line 191, in ltmodulegt         A  zerosnxnynz. nxnynz, float MemoryError codepre  pHere, codenx  32code.

Negative 432 pIm having some troubles moving the ResultSet current record.p  pIm learning JDBC and I came from Clipper and Delphi. So I used to have some kind of reference like a record number or a reference to a tagged record, so I can save this reference and move back to this position later. While trying to do the same with JDBC and MySql, I tried to use a select  where statement to get the record I want. Thats ok. But when I try to get the line of the record,  it happens that theres always just one line in the ResultSet I realised it could happen even before I write the code, but I had to test, cause its how you learn. .p  pSo, to make things short. I need a way to find a record by some value like the primary key with a selectwhere maybe and save this position. So I can move the database to this same record but with a large collection of data not just the filtered data. I could do a while next or work arround some sql codes to make my form work in a diferent way. But its not my goal.p  pSo. anyone got some tips on how to do that Thats my DAO class.

Negative 432 pSo I have a java program, for which, I have an ant script to run. I know how to enable the debugging option in the ant script, by adding two parameters Xdebug Xrunjdwptransportdtsocket,servery,suspendn,address5432 to the ants java task.p  pAfter adding those parameters to the java task in ant, I open the ant view in eclipse, rightclick on the target I want to debug, and choose debug as  ant build.p  pNow, I need to attach this debugger to that same eclipse which runs on the same machine, so that it will take me to the java code, and I can debug it line by line. p  pThe two questions are 1 how to attach that ant debugger to eclipse and how to run itp  pI found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2406825howtodebugjavacodewhenusingantscriptineclipseHow to debug Java code when using ANT script in Eclipsea, but it does not explain how to attach an ant debugger to eclipse, and how to run.p  pI know, you may ask, why dont I just debug the java program directly on eclipse The thing is, the program is quite large, have a lot of junit suite tests, and we use ant to run those tests. The ant was written by some other developer.p  pThanks  p

This part is fun. p  pBut now I am thinking about remoting and how to connect all the clients web, mobile, windows with my backend. p  pstrong1. What do you prefer for the remoting between client and backend SOAPWeb Services or a RESTAPI e.g. with JSON.strongp  pstrong2. If RESTAPI How should the API look like for authenticationlogin functionality REST is resourceoriented but how do you implement authentication with REST APIstrongp  pAt the moment I think a RESTAPI is a good idea. Because I am using spring it is easy to create a Spring MVC controller with REST support. But is this the correct way to implement a REST API for all the three devices The web client e.g. should be implemented with JSF and Primefaces and I dont use spring MVC for the web layer. p  pstrong3.Can I nevertheless use Spring MVC controllers to build the REST API together with JSF in the web layer Or is there a better waystrongp

Negative 432 pIm having an issue with a HTML5 canvas idea. Its basically a game, whereby the player is always centered in the canvas  this means that for movement the rest of the scene must move instead. I have this setup, but I also wanted to have a clickable grid 50x50 px on top of the scene as if the games elements are made up of blocks.p  pFor drawing the mouse box I have the following codep  precode Draw mouse box ifgame.mouse.o     var mouseBlockX  Math.floorgame.mouse.x  50  50  game.view.x  50      Previous attempt      var mouseBlockX  Math.floorgame.mouse.x   0.5  game.view.x  50  50  50  game.view.x  50     var mouseBlockY  Math.floorgame.mouse.y   0.5  game.view.y  50  50  50  game.view.y  50      ctx.fillTextBlock   mouseBlockX.toString    mouseBlockY.toString, 5, 400     ctx.fillTextMath.absgame.view.x  50, 5, 410      ctx.strokeStyle  DDDDFF     ctx.strokeWidth  1     ctx.strokeRectmouseBlockX, mouseBlockY, 50, 50  codepre  pEssentially, my main issue here is that the following line doesnt work properlyp  precodeMath.floorgame.mouse.x   0.5  game.view.x  50  50  50  game.view.x  50 codepre  p...and Ive tried to find a correct version, but its beating me at the minute. What would be the correct formula so that the mouses box follows the mouse, but also compensates for the view moving Have I made it too complicated so Im missing the answerp  pstrongJSFiddlestrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nety14ftv0o relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nety14ftv0oap  pstrongUPDATEstrong changed variables to be clearer. To try and explain in a better way when the view moves, the grid doesnt properly stick to its original position. When the view moves, the grid should look like it is fixed to the original objects on the scene essentially so the user thinks theyre clicking on things in the scene on a grid.p
