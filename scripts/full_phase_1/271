I cant find an answer in the GitHub help I did look and I did ask some software developers Im using GitHub to store documentation and they didnt know eitherp  pHeres the scenario I have a GitHub repository call it A. If someone wants to make updates they fork that repository to one of their own call it B. They can then click Clone in Desktop to get a local copy.p  pThey make edits locally and then open GitHub Desktop. p  pIn GitHub Desktop they can use Commit to Master and then hit the Sync button. This syncs them with repository B. If they want to then copy the edits to repository A, they go into GitHub and make a pull request. I get that.p  pBut GitHub Desktop also has a Pull Request button, and I dont get who its making the request to Is it repository A or repository B Or something completely differentp  pIf its repository B, then whats the difference between commitsync and the pull request buttonp  pI cant try it out because that button is always greyed out for me maybe because I own the repositoryp  pAnd can a user make a pull request directly into repository A from GitHub Desktop  or will it always be a twostep process via repository Bp

Negative 271 pIm trying to come up with a simple, easy to use design pattern for error handling in a .net wcf service specifically a silverlight enabled wcf service.

Negative 271 pAbout a year ago our company rolled a relatively large software package written primarily by two senior developers.  For ease of demonstration, Ill call it project A.  Since then, we have been working on a new software package, project B and in its tree is a branch of project A.p  pProject B has a reference to project A, but now that were nearing the end of project B, we also need to reference B from A.  So, after merging the branches of A and before going live with B, we would like to merge the core libraries between the two projects.p  pWhat are some experiences you have had with this type of situation  What are some best practices and lessons learned on this project  How can we best merge the core libraries with minimal impact to the rest of the source code in project Ap  pstrongEDITstrong What is your opinion on the feasibility of retaining project As namespaces, but locating the code in project Bs core library which will ultimately become the companys core library  From there, just reference the new company core library in the legacy projects...p  pstrongEDIT 2strong Thanks for the replies.  Maybe a bit more technical clarification is in order.  Both of these projects are very closely related but each has their own .NET Class Library project for a core library.  Beyond that, each library is referenced by other various .NET projects internal and external Web Apps, Forms Apps, etc.  More of my question is where the source code should live  I dont believe that they should remain two separate .NET projects, but a single project contains both, keeping the existing namespaces initially.  As we continue to develop, well refactor, combining namespaces, clearing out duplicate functionality, etc.  There is no doubt functionality contained in both existing libraries that will be useful in upcoming projects and there is also an emerging need to share between both existing core libraries.p

Negative 271 pI am hosting a Django app on Apache using modpython.  Occasionally, I get some cryptic modpython errors, usually of the codeImportErrorcode variety, although not usually referring to the same module.  The thing is, these seem to come up for a single forked subprocess, while the others operate fine, even when I force behavior that requires using the module that the problem process has errored on.  Once the process encounters the error, it will always just serve the same traceback every time Apache chooses it to handle a request.  This is also a hassle, since my users dont necessarily report the error on the first occurrence, and once the process encounters the error.p  pI know more about configuring Django than configuring Apache, but that wont get me anywhere since the request never reaches Django for processing.

The reason is that I dont know a way to remove the items from the queue safely.p  pa hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencestlqueue relnofollowThisa reference states vacuously, so I guess it doesnt actually STATE it that the only way to remove elements from the queue is to call codepopcode. The reference also says that codepopcode calls the destructor for the item.p  pWell, this causes problems with my pointer types because they may or may not actually point to aggregates. If one of them points to an aggregate, they all will, but because the wrapper is templated, there is no guarantee which type aggregated or nonaggregated we are dealing with.p  pSo, when codepopcode calls the destructor, what happens How do I ensure that everything is being removed and the memory deallocation properlyp  pLastly, my solution is using an older version of GCC for ARM9.

Negative 271 pI am having issues with something that seems like it should be very simple but in fact has proven quite difficult.p  pLets say you have a TabControl bound to an itemsource of ViewModels and the items displayed using a DataTemplate. Now lets say the DataTemplate consists of a Grid with two columns and a Grid splitter to resize the columns. p  pThe problem is if you resize the columns on one tab, and switch to another tab, the columns are also resized. This is because the TabControl shares the DataTemplate among all tabs. This lack of UI persistence is applied to all elements of the template which can make for a frustrating experience when various UI components are adjusted. Another example is the scroll position in a DataGrid on a tab. A DataGrid with few items will be scrolled out of view only one row visible if a DataGrid with more rows was scrolled to the bottom on another tab. On top of this, if the TabControl has various items defined in multiple DataTemplates the view is reset when you switch between items of differenet types. I can understand that this approach saves resources but the resultant functionality seems quite contradictory to expected UI behavior.p  pAnd so im wondering if there is a solutionworkaround to this as im sure its something that others have encountered before. Ive noticed a few similar questions on other forums but there was no real solution. One about using the AdornerDecorator but that doesnt seem to work when used with a DataTemplate. Im not keen on binding all the UI properties like column width, scroll position to my ViewModels and in fact I tried it for the simple GridSplitter example and I didnt manage to make it work. The width of the ColumnDefinitions were not necessarily affected by a grid splitter. Regardless, it would be nice if there were a general solution to this. Any thoughtsp  pIf I ditch the TabControl and use an ItemsControl will I encounter a similar issue Would it be possible to modify the TabControl Style so it doesnt share the ContentPresenter between tabsp

Negative 271 pAs part of a solution containing many projects, I have a project that references via a codeltProjectReferencegtcode three other projects in the solution, plus some others. In the codeAfterBuildcode, I need to copy the outputs of 3 specific dependent projects to another location.p  pVia various SO answers, etc. the way I settled on to accomplish that wasp  precode    ltMSBuild          ProjectsProjectReference          TargetsBuild          BuildInParalleltrue          ConditionNameProjectA OR NameProjectB OR NameProjectCgt         ltOutput TaskParameterTargetOutputs ItemNameDependentAssemblies gt     ltMSBuildgt     ltCopy SourceFilesDependentAssemblies DestinationFolderXX SkipUnchangedFilestrue gt codepre  pHowever, I ran into problems with this. The codeltMSBuildcode steps codeIncrementalCleancode task ends up deleting a number of the outputs of codeProjectCcode. When running this under VS2008, a codebuild.forcecode file being deposited in the codeobjDebugcode folder of ProjectC which then triggers ProjectC getting rebuilt if I do a Build on the entire solution if the project containing this codeAfterBuildcode target, whereas if one excludes this project from the build, it [correctly] doesnt trigger a rebuild of ProjectC and emcriticallyem a rebuild of all dependents of ProjectC. This may be VSspecific trickery in this case which would not occur in the context of a TeamBuild or other commandline MSBuild invocation but the most common usage will be via VS so I need to resolve this either wayp  pThe dependent projects and the rest of the solution in general have all been created interactively with VS, and hence the codeProjectRefencecodes contain relative paths etc. Ive seen mention of this being likely to causing issues  but without a full explanation of why, or when itll be fixed or how to work around it. In other words, Im not really interested in e.g. converting the codeProjectReferencecode paths to absolute paths by handediting the .csproj.p  pWhile its entirely possible Im doing something stupid and someone will immediately point out what it is which would be great, be assured Ive spent lots of time poring over codevdiagcode outputs etc. although I havent tried to build a repro from the ground up  this is in the context of a relatively complex overall buildp
Negative 271 pI saw DamienGs article a hrefhttpdamieng.comblog20090624clientsidepropertiesandanyremotelinqprovider relnofollowhttpdamieng.comblog20090624clientsidepropertiesandanyremotelinqprovidera in how to map client properties to sql. i ran throgh this article, and i saw great potential in it. Definitely mapping client properties to SQL is an awesome idea.p  pBut i wanted to use this for something a bit more complicated then just concatenating strings. Atm we are trying to introduce multilinguality to our Business objects, and i hoped we could leave all the existing linq2sql queries intact, and just change the code of the multilingual properties, so they would actually return the given property in the CurrentUICulture.p  pThe first idea was to change these fields to XMLs, and then try the Object.Property.Elements.Where..., but it got stuck on the Elements, as it couldnt translate it to sql. I read somewhere that XML fields are actually regarded as strings, and only on the app server they become XElements, so this way the filtering would be on the app server anyways, not the DB. Fair point, it wont work like this. Lets try something else... SO the second idea was to create a PolyGlots table name taken from a hrefhttpweblogic.syscon.comnode102698page0,1 relnofollowhttpweblogic.syscon.comnode102698page0,1a, a PolyGlotTranslations table and a Culture table, where the PolyGlots would be referenced from each internationalized property. This way i wanted to say for examplep  precodeprivate static readonly CompiledExpressionltAnnouncement, stringgt nameExpression      DefaultTranslationOfltAnnouncementgt         .Propertye gt e.Name         .Isegt e.NamePolyGlot.PolyGlotTranslations           .Wheretgt t.Culture.Code  Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture.Name           .Single.Value          codepre  pnow unfortunately here i get an error that the Where function cannot be translated to sql, what is a bit disappointing, as i was sure it will go through.  I guess it is failing, cause the IEntitySet is basically an IEnumerable, not IQueryable, am i rightp  pIs there another way to use the compiledExpressions class to achieve this goal Any help appreciated.p

Negative 271 pI am using a hrefhttpwww.dillerdesign.comexperimentDDroundies relnofollowDDroundiesa to generate rounded corners in Internet Explorer. The pages that have the rounded elements are loaded very often and the roundies script has to run many times to round corners and fix pngs. This costs a lot of time. The script produces some VML elements that are placed in the targeted elements, and some CSS that it injects into a  block.p  pI want to save both the VML and the CSS to reuse when the page loads so that I dont have to run the script every time. The targeted elements are already being saved in a database and reinserted into the DOM through java at load time.p  pI made a test page where after the roundies script runs I then grab the html of the elements including the VML, the XML namespace, and the CSS. Im having some troubles getting the innerHTML of the  block in IE, but I was able to get it using IE developer tools just so I could test it. After getting the various pieces I placed them on a separate HTML file to see if they would render correctly. My test did not work.p  pHere is the first test pagep  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.4jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.2jqueryui.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.2themesbasejqueryui.css typetextcss mediaall gt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function    DDroundies.addRuleblock1, 20px 20px 0 0, true    DDroundies.addRuleblock2, 0 20px 20px 0, true    DDroundies.addRuleblock3, 0 0 20px 20px, true    DDroundies.addRuleblock4, 20px 0 0 20px, true    getContent.clickfunction       var allHTML  allContent.html       captureContent.textallHTML.valallHTML        getStyles.clickfunction       var allStyles  allStyles.html       captureStyles.textallStyles.valallStyles      ltscriptgt ltdiv idallContentgt ltscript srchttpwww.dillerdesign.comexperimentDDroundiesDDroundies0.0.2amin.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltstyle idallStyles typetextcssgt    .blocks       width 150px       height 100px       margin 5px       border 3px solid 999     ltstylegt ltdiv idblock1 classblocksgtltdivgt ltdiv idblock2 classblocksgtltdivgt ltdiv idblock3 classblocksgtltdivgt ltdiv idblock4 classblocksgtltdivgt ltdivgt ltbutton idgetStylesgtGet Stylesltbuttongt lttextarea idcaptureStylesgtlttextareagt ltbr gt ltbutton idgetContentgtGet Contentltbuttongt lttextarea idcaptureContentgtlttextareagt codepre  pAny help will be greatly appreciated, thanksp

Negative 271 pIm working on a custom ecommerce system for a client and ran into a fork in the road. The checkout system Im using is very flexible and is meant to be integrated into an existing Web site. So essentially, I have all my products on a page. Each product has a Buy Now button associated with it. When clicking on that button, a modal window opens, showing a cartlike screen with the item they chose being added. From here, they can either close the modal window and buy another product or checkout. Here is where the fork comes inp  pstrongOption Astrong They are now redirected to the merchants site for the actual checkout. I can make that page look anyway I want, but its independent from the clients real site. So if something on the real site changes, I have to update my files on the merchants site manually so there wont be any confusions e.a. a new menu item is added in the header.p  pemProem They checkout on a page thats branded as the client and it takes up the full page. It might provide a better sense of security as apposed to option B.p  pemConem May involve some manual maintenance to keep the appearance of the site consistent.p  pstrongOption Bstrong When the modal window displays and they click on checkout, a new windowpopup opens up. It shows them everything they need to checkout... name, address, billing info, etc. It would still be branded as the clients checkout system, but you wouldnt see the entire site headerfooter in that popup window.p  pemProem No maintenance involved and theyll always see the site in the background and know where they are at. On completion of checkout, they can close the window and are right back where they left of.p  pemConem It might defer some people from checking out, because you cant really tell where youre entering your credit card info... although it would be branded accordingly. They may also have a popup blocker that could prevent the window from opening in the first place.p  hr  pDoes anyone have any experience with this Are people less likely to checkout from a popup window vs. a full page checkout systemp  pAny feedback much appreciated.p  pRyanp

Negative 271 pI often read that one purpose of a VIEW is security to allow some users access to the underlying table, and other users to a derived view only. With that in mind I designed several views that supply restricted datasets to external users.p  pAll very fine, but in practice this doesnt work. After I grant codeSELECTcode permission on a view, the users cant access it unless I grant codeSELECTcode on all underlying objects too. Same story for stored procedures. The net result is nonfunctional, for I end up still granting access to sensitive data to the wrong users, as well as annoying, for it is easy to forget one object and the users come back to complain that the view doesnt work.p  pIs there a way to grant codeSELECTcode permissions on a view or stored procedure without having to expose the underlying objects toop

Negative 271 phere is more detailed explanation i am using the ubercart module with the file download feature module the ucfile module . i have created a product class which is a new contenttype as far as the drupal system and add a cck file field to it. what i want to achive is the following behavior once a user saves a new node of my product class, i want the uploaded file to be added as a file download feature to the product class automatically. i know i can hack the function ucfilefeatureformsubmitform, ampformstate, do what it does in my module code, but i rather ivoke it since ill have easier life with future changes to the ucfile module since i am calling its function, i dont care if it will change in the future. so, to invoke the ucfilefeatureformsubmit function i need to build fake form, ampformstate parameters, i know i can printr those arrays, and build it from there, the thing is that there are a lot of data in those arrays that is not mandatory, i was wondering what are those mandatory fields that i have to build on my own. thank you...p
Negative 271 pI am creating this custom theme emwww.designislikethis.tumblr.comem, which uses the jQuery Masonry and the Slider plugins.

Negative 271 pIm currently developing a generalpurpose agentbased programming language its syntaxt will be somewhat inspired by Java, and we are also using object in this language.p  pSince the beginning of the project we were doubtful about the fact of using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiANTLR relnofollowANTLRa or a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgXtext relnofollowXtexta. At that time we found out that Xtext was implementing a subset of the feature of ANTLR. So we decided to use ANLTR for our language losing the possibility to have a fullfledged Eclipse editor for free for our language such a nice features provided by Xtext.p  pHowever, as the best of my knowledge, this summer the Xtext project has done a a hrefhttpeclipse.dzone.comarticlesxtext relnofollowbig step forwarda. Quoting from the linkp  blockquote   pstrongWhat are the limitations of Xtextstrongp      pSven You can implement almost any kind of programming language or DSL   with Xtext. There is one exception, that is if you need to use so    called  Semantic Predicates which is a rather complicated thing I    dont think is worth being explained here. Very few languages really   need this concept. However the prominent example is CC.  We want to   look into that topic for the next release.p blockquote  pAnd that is also reinforced in the a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgXtextdocumentation101xtext.htmlWhatisXtext relnofollowXtext documentationap  blockquote   pstrongWhat is Xtextstrong No matter if you want to create a small textual domainspecific language DSL or you want to implement a fullblown   general purpose programming language. With Xtext you can create your   very own languages in a snap. Also if you already have an existing   language but it lacks decent tool support, you can use Xtext to create   a sophisticated Eclipsebased development environment providing   editing experience known from modern Java IDEs in a surprisingly short   amount of time. We call Xtext a language development framework.p blockquote  pIf Xtext has got rid of its past limitations why is it still not possible to find a complex Xtext grammar for the best known programming languages Java, C, etc. p  pOn the ANTLR website you can find tons of such grammar examples, for what concerns Xtext instead the only sample I was able to find is the one reported in the documentation. So maybe Xtext is still not mature to be used for implementing a general purpose programming language Im a bit worried about this... I would not start to rewrite the grammar in Xtext for then to recognize that it was not suited for that.p

I basically unpacked it and added all the packages into the project, but the one time it worked it made the movie file unreadable to any media player afterwards. If anyone has specific knowledge of how to import and use JID3 that would be great.pli lipIve found this site a hrefhttpwillcode4beer.comparsing.jspsetmp3ID3 relnofollowhttpwillcode4beer.comparsing.jspsetmp3ID3a which has some seemingly good code for reading and writing ID3 tags, unfortunately it does not work properly constantly returning strings of question marks or telling me that the file is not there spontaneously it will literally work one time and then not work another time without any changes. Nevertheless I like the idea of simply reading the bytes or ASCII of a file and findingediting the ID3 tag that way so if anyone knows what to do for that, thatd be awesome.pli ol  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 271 pIm developing a mobile app which runs a simple HTTP server and a WebView. The WebView displays an external website which should access the server via javascript GET. Unfortunately this doesnt work and I assume its due to the same origin policy but the console doesnt show any errors. I had a similar error before which required me to define AccessControlAllowOrigin  on the server side. This error already took a while to find because there were no error messages Firebug Net tab showed a completed GET request with empty response data. Now I assume a same origin policy violation in the external script, but its hard to tell because of the missing error messages. The only hint I see is in Firebug Net tab, showing a connection which never completes. I checked the packages sent to localhost but there wasnt even a connection attempt  thus I assume the browser is holding it back.p  pHow do I display Javascript same origin policy violation errors in Firefox ext Firebug, Webdeveloperp

Negative 271 pIve been developing a web site with the Play framework scala using H2 as a backend. Testing is nicely integrated, especially with the ability to run tests against an inmemory H2 db.p  pNow Id like to move my datastore over to Postgres for various convenience reasons. This leaves me with a problem How to continue to test and retain the simplicity of a fresh db for each test run I see on the net that some people manage to run live against postgres and test against H2. However the two are not entirely compatible at the SQL level even with H2 in Postgres compatibility mode.

Negative 271 pIm looking for a function for CC that behaves identically to PHPs md5 function  pass in a string, return a oneway hash of that string.  Im also open to other algorithms than md5 if they are as secure or more secure, reasonably fast, and ideally oneway.p  pThe reason Im searching for said function is for the same purpose I would use PHPs md5 function to store a oneway hash of a users password in a database rather than the actual text of the users password in case the databases data is ever compromised, the users passwords would still be relatively secret.p  pIve spent around two hours searching now.  All the code Ive found either was for getting an MD5 of file data instead of just a string, wouldnt compile, was for another programming language, or required an entire library such as Crypto, OpenSSL, hashlib to be added to my project, some of which are very large is that really necessary when all I want is just one oneway string hashing function.p  pSeeing as how this is a common need, Im assuming someone has already written and made available exactly what Im looking for.. can someone point me to itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 271 pI need to deal with a two objects of a class in a way that will return a third object of the same class, and I am trying to determine whether it is better to do this as an independent function that receives two objects and returns the third or as a method which would take one other object and return the third.p  hr  pFor a simple example.  Would thisp  precodefrom collections import namedtuple  class PointnamedtuplePoint, x y     slots       Attached to class     def midpointself, otherpoint         mx  self.x  otherpoint.x  2.0         my  self.y  otherpoint.y  2.0         return Pointmx, my  a  Point1.0, 2.0 b  Point2.0, 3.0  print a.midpointb Pointx1.5, y2.5 codepre  pOr thisp  precodefrom collections import namedtuple  class PointnamedtuplePoint, x y     slots     not attached to class takes two point objects def midpointp1, p2     mx  p1.x  p2.x  2.0     my  p1.y  p2.y  2.0     return Pointmx, my   a  Point1.0, 2.0 b  Point2.0, 3.0  print midpointa, b Pointx1.5, y2.5 codepre  pand why would one be preferred over the otherp  hr  pThis seems far less clear cut than I had expected when I asked the question.p  pIn summary, it seems that something like a.midpointb is not preferred since it seems to give a special place to one point or another in what is really a symmetric function that returns a completely new point instance.  But it seems to be largely a matter of taste and style between something like a freestanding module function or a function attached to the class, but not meant to be called by the insance, such as Point.midpointa, b.p  pI think, personally, I stylistically lean towards freestanding module functions, but it may depend on the circumstances.  In cases where the function is definitely tightly bound to the class and there is any risk of namespace pollution or potential confusion, then making a class function probably makes more sense.p  pAlso, a couple of people mentioned making the function more general, perhaps by implementing additional features of the class to support this.  In this particular case dealing with points and midpoints, that is probably the overall best approach.  It supports polymorphism and code reuse and is highly readable.  In a lot of cases though, that would not work the project that inspired me to ask this for instance, but points and midpoints seemed like a concise and understandable example to illustrate the question.p  pThank you all, it was enlightening.p

Negative 271 pin a continuous integration build environment when running several Selenium tests in parallel using Firefox driver for different applications and each tests records its screenshots after every action e.g. navigating to a page, submitting a form etc. it seems like that whichever application window pops up that one gets on the top of the zaxis and will have the focus.  So using the method getScreenshotAs from the Selenium API to record images results in mixed up screenshots sometimes showing one application and sometimes the other application. Recording the HTML responses with getPageSource on the other hand seems to work correctly using the Firefox driver instance bound to the test.p  pIs there any solution how to deal with the mixed up image screenshots Is there a possibility how to ensure that getScreenshotAs only consideres its own Firefox driver instance Thanks for any hintsp  pPeterp

Negative 271 pAs with any memory management issue, this is a long story, so strapin.p  pWe have an application that has been suffering from some memory management issues, so Ive been trying to profile the app to get an idea of where the problem lies. I saw this thread earlier todayp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1197530tomcatsessionevictiontoavoidoutofmemoryerrorTomcat Session Eviction to Avoid OutOfMemoryErrorap  p... which seems to follow suit with what I was seeing in the profiler. Basically, if I hit the app with a bunch of users with Jmeter it would hold onto the heap memory for a long time, eventually until the sessions began to expire. Unlike the poster in that thread however, I have the source, and the option to try to implement persistent state sessions with Tomcat, which is what Ive been trying to do today, with limited success. I think it is some configuration setting I am missing. Here is what I have in context.xmlp  precode  ltManager classNameorg.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManager                 saveOnRestartfalse                 maxActiveSessions5                 minIdelSwap0                 maxIdleSwap1                 maxInactiveInterval600                 maxIdleBackup0gt    ltStore classNameorg.apache.catalina.session.FileStoregt    ltManagergt codepre  pAnd in web.xml I have thisp  precodeltsessionconfiggt     ltsessiontimeoutgt         10     ltsessiontimeoutgt ltsessionconfiggt codepre  pIdeally I would like the sessions to timeout in an hour, but for testing purposes this is fine. Now after having played around with some things and finally coming to these settings, I am watching the app in the profiler and this is what I am seeingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6BIL3.jpg altenter image description herep  pAs you can see in the image, I have put some annotations. Its the part circled around the question mark which I really do not understand more than anything else. You can see that I am using the Jconsole Perform GC button at a few different points, and you can see the part in the chart where I am hitting the application with many client with Jmeter. p  pIf I recall correctly Id have to go back and really document it to be sure, before I implemented persistent state, the GC button would not do nearly as much with regards to clearing the heap. The strange bit here is that it seems like I have to manually run GC for this persistent state to actually help with anything. p  pAlternatively, is this just a plain memory leak scenario Earlier today, I took a heap dump and loaded it into Eclipse Memory Analyzer tool, and used the Detect Leak feature, and all it did was reinforce the theory that this is a session size issue the only leak it detected was in java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMapSegment  which led me to this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3959122memoryfullyutilizedbyjavaconcurrenthashmapundertomcatMemory Fully utilized by Java ConcurrentHashMap under Tomcatap  pwhich makes me think its not the app thats actually leaking.p  pOther relevant details    Runningtesting this on my local machine for the time being. Thats where all these results come from.   Using Tomcat 6   This is a JSF2.0 app   I have added the system property Dorg.apache.catalina.STRICTSERVLETCOMPLIANCEtrue  as per the Tomcat documentationp  pSo, I guess there is several questions here  1. Do I have this configured properly  2. Is there a memory leak  3. What is going on in this memory profile  4. Is it relatively normalp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo, I tried Seans tips, and found some new interesting things. p  pThe session listener works great, and has been instrumental in analyzing this scenario. Something else, that I forgot to mention is that the apps load is only really confounded by a single page, which reaches a functional complexity on an almost comical proportion. So, in testing, I sometimes aim to hit that page, and other times I avoid it. So in my next round of tests, this time using the session listener I found the followingp  p1 Hit the app with several dozen clients, just visiting a simple page. I noted that the sessions were all released as expected after the specified time limit, and the memory was released. Same thing works perfectly with a trivial number of clients, for the complex case, hitting the big page.p  p2 Next, I tried hitting the app with the complex use case, with several dozen clients. This time, several dozen more sessions were initiated than expected. It seemed like every client initiated between one and three sessions. After the session expiration time, a little memory was released, but according to the session listener, only about a third of the sessions were destroyed. Contradicting that though, the folder which actually contains the sessions data is empty. Most of the memory that was used is being held, too. But, after exactly one hour of running the stress test, the garbage collector runs and everything is back to normal.p  pSo, follow up questions includep  p1 Why might the sessions be handled properly in the simple case, but when things get memory intensive, they stop being managed correctly Is the Session handler misreporting things, or does using JMeter impact this in some wayp  p2 Why does the garbage collector wait one hour to run Is there a system setting that mandates that the garbage collector MUST run within a given time frame, or if there some configuration setting Im missingp  pThank you again for continued support.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pJust a quick note playing around with this some more, I found out the reason I was getting different reports about the number of live sessions is due to the fact that I am using persistent session if I turn it off, everything works as expected. It indeed says on the Tomcat page for persistent session, that it is an experimental feature. It must be calling sessions events that the listener is picking up on, when one would atypically expect it to do so.p

In landscape mode, when the leftViewController is shown UITableViewController, then the user can tap on one item and it is pushed onto the left part of the SplitViewController another list of items UITableViewController. As a result, it appears the title and the back button with the title of the previous list this is the back button offered by the UITableViewController, so I have not programmed a new button to implement that behavior. During all that process the map does not change and this is the desired behavior.p  pThe problem is related to the back button and in landscape mode that is, when it is pressed then the previous list is shown and this is the desired behavior, however it seems like all the screen the menu bar at the top and also the sliptviewcontroller with left and rigth viewcontrollers is refreshed repainted from top to bottom during less than one second.p  pI am quite sure that is not a problem related to animation because I have commented, in the code, all the sentences related to animation, and, I also have set to false all the function arguments like animate.p  pIt is a esthetic problem, but I would like to correct it.p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 271 pFor a JOGL application, I have a realsize model of an object. My model is a little big it can be surrounded by a sphere of radius 3 meters. While working on this, couple of questions have puzzled my mindp  ol liDoes the size of the model has any effect on the render time More precisely, if I scaled down my model by a factor of 0.01, am I going to have a faster render scaling down the model before importing and not using glScaleli liConsider Im brightening my scene with a light source which has a certain intensity. If I scale updown my model, in order to obtain the same appearance, should I also scale my light intensityli ol

Negative 271 pSo I have a weird situation here.p  pIm working on extending the a hrefhttpgrails.orgpluginclojureGrails Clojure plugina in a hrefhttpgrails.orgdoc2.0.xguideintroduction.htmlGrails 2.0.0a and 2.1.0SNAPSHOT and I wanted to update it to a hrefhttpclojure.orgdownloadsClojure 1.3.0a and add a hrefhttpsgithub.comclojuretools.loggingclojure.tools.logginga. p  pClojure throws an exception during compilation of a  emproxyem of a codeByteArrayOutputStreamcode in codeclojure.tools.loggingcodes logstream function p  pcodeClassCastException clojure.asm.Type cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFncodep  p a hrefhttpsgist.github.coma6ae681c37091a3d2379httpsgist.github.coma6ae681c37091a3d2379a p  pI went and removed codeclojure.tools.loggingcode and wrote a stripped down emproxyem of codeObjectcode p  pcodeproxy [java.lang.Object] [] toString [] proxys toStringcode p  pand it also threw that same codeClassCastExceptioncode and message. p  pI tried to print a emmacroexpand1em of the emproxyem and got the same thing. p  pI reverted to Clojure 1.2.0 and emproxyem worked fine again. p  pI tried a number of incarnations of 1.4.0 and they exhibit the same behavior as 1.3.0.  1.2.1 also throws some sort of exception but Im trying to hit 1.3.0 so I didnt spend much time with that.p  pThe stack trace points to the genmethod function defined in one of the emletem forms of codegenerateproxycode in codecoreproxy.cljcode. p  pI added a small smattering of codeprintlncodes around there to see if I could catch what was happening. Maybe this next statement will betray a huge misunderstanding of the reader on my part but simply adding those codeprintlncodes changed the compile time behavior in a way I totally didnt expect. The exception location and exception type completely changed, even though all the Clojure tests in codemvn packagecode continue to pass.p  pFor instance, just adding a single codeprintlncode to genmethod right before it starts generating bytecode caused Clojure to throw p  pcodeClassCastException clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap cannot be cast to java.lang.Classcode p  p a hrefhttpsgist.github.com5a7a40929a6c4a104bd5httpsgist.github.com5a7a40929a6c4a104bd5a p  pIve seen various other errors depending on where I put the codeprintlncodes but this is the most prevalent.p  pObviously some aspect of Grails and Clojure are not meshing correctly here, but I am not seeing the connection. At first I suspected ASM incompatibility but since Clojure has its own ASM namespace, I cant see that being the issue. But maybe Im wrong, Ive been staring at codeclojure.lang.Compilercode, emproxyem and emgenerateproxyem for days now trying to get this to work and Ive pretty much stopped making forward progress because Ive run out of steam p  pThanks in advance for any assistance.

Negative 271 pSorry I couldnt think of a more informative title, but heres my challenge. I have a matrix and I need to add columns in specific places based on parameters described by a vector. For example, if I have the following matrixp  precode1, 0, 1, 2, 0 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 2, 0, 1, 0, 2 codepre  pbut for a particular R package unmarked, I need to add columns of NA in specific place. I have a vector relating the columns in the matrixp  precode1, 1, 1, 2, 3 codepre  pWhich indicates that columns 13 were from the same sampling period and columns 4 and 5 were from different sampling periods. I need to make the number of columns in the matrix equal the max number from the same sampling period times the number of sampling periods. In this case there are three 1s max number of any unique value in the vector and a total of three sampling periods max number in the vector. So I need a matrix with 9 columns 3 x 3. Specifically, I need to add the new columns of NAs after the 4th and 5th columns. Basically, I just need columns of NAs to be placeholders to have a matrix where the number of observations each column is the same 3 for each of the sample periods indicated by the number in the vector. This is difficult to describe but in this imaginary example I would want to end up withp  precode1, 0, 1, 2, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA 0, 0, 1, 1, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA 1, 1, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA 2, 0, 1, 0, NA, NA, 2, NA, NA codepre  pthis would be described by a vector that looked likep  precode1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3 codepre  palthough I dont actually need to produce that vector, just the matrix. Obviously, it was easy to add those columns in this case, but for my data I have a much bigger matrix that will end up with 200 columns. Plus I will likely have to do this for numerous data sets.p  pCan anyone help me with a way to code this in R so that I can automate the process of expanding the matrixp  pThanks for any advice or suggestionsp  hr  pEDIT to make things a bit more similar to my actual data here is a reproducible matrix and vector similar to my current onesp  precode    m lt matrixrpois12026, 1, nrow  120, ncol  26     v lt c1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7 codepre

And from all possible examples i see I have to use global wpdb or include some php files, or extend wpdb with my own DB class, but what is the best  correct way in OOP approach p  pthis is part of my code, constructor and try to call db function that gives me errors all the time. p  precodeclass FeatDispWidget extends WPWidget        private featdisplayertable      featdisplayertable  wpdbgtprefix . featdisplayer      Widget setup.   function FeatDispWidget       Widget settings.      widgetops  array classname gt featdisp, description gt Sexy Feature Displayer., featdisp        Widget control settings.      controlops  array width gt 300, height gt 350, idbase gt featdispwidget        Create the widget.      thisgtWPWidget featdispwidget, Feature Displayer Widget, featdisp, widgetops, controlops           function featDispDBsetup          global wpdb         global featdisplayertable           if  wpdbgtgetvar show tables like featdisplayertable   featdisplayertable       sql  CREATE TABLE featdisplayertable .         sandfid INT NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT, .         type VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL, .         attachid INT NOT NULL, .         setid INT NOT NULL, .         imgpath LONGTEXT NOT NULL, .                     title LONGTEXT NOT NULL, .         desc LONGTEXT, .                     linkto LONGTEXT, .                     altertext LONGTEXT, .                     txtnxttoimg LONGTEXT, .                     sortorder INT, .                       requireonce ABSPATH . wpadminincludesupgrade.php      dbDelta sql                 codepre  pSo my questionsp  p1 can I extend WPwidget, as I do, and display it on both pages and sidebar  2 do I need to extend WPwidget in order to have widget instantiated several times once on each page 3 If I extend WPwidget, where do I put wpdb in order to create table in wp databasep  pSo, this is it for now, I think I took something to complex for my first widget, but Im not giving up  p

Negative 271 pI am making an interactive walkthrough for one of my apps, and in a couple of spots an alpha animation and some various other UI changes such as checkbox pressed states would be really great. p  pThe walkthrough has a back and next button. The basic idea is that the next button would start the animation maybe as a thread, and if at any point in the animation the back button was pressed, that the animation would stop.p  pI have looked into the built in Android animation library, but have sort of seen a lot left to be desired. My next thought was a thread, but I know I cant change the UI from an outside thread. Also I want to leave the UI thread open for my back button listener.p  pAny thoughts on how these simple animations could be achievedp

Negative 271 pI expect the answer to this is already here someplace, but I was not able to find it. Im wasting too much time messing around with this. Best to just ask and move on.p  pI am trying to create a bash shell script which when run will prompt for the name of an alias and the replacement string and then create that alias. So, being not the sharpest tool in the toolshed, I tried copied from a blog actually the code below.p  precodebinbash echo Enter the identifier for the alias shortcut read SHORTTEXT echo Now enter the string which SHORTTEXT will alias read LONGTEXT alias SHORTTEXTLONGTEXT codepre  pI put the above code into the file codescriptsnojoy.shcode, made the file executable, and then tried it out.p  precodemyidmyid lsbrelease a No LSB modules are available.

Can someone please just explain to me how to do this so I can get on to doing something else more important than this Like cleaning litter boxes maybep  hr  h3Updateh3  pI did not expect to have a hard time picking an answer for this.

That is, if I defined an alias named  codeexamplecode  for   codeecho .txtcode   then when I used it Id expect the result to be  code.txtcodep  pUsing the method in the first answer does this.

Negative 271 pI have an slightly oneoff scenario for a site Im working on.p  pI am routing certain request paths to a custom HTTP module that dynamically outputs static content. By that, I mean javascript and css content. However, that content is generated dynamically by the module, but once generated, does not change very often.p  pSo, I would like to cache the output of my custom module, but for some reason, neither cached content, nor 304s are being returned to the client like I would expect.p  pIf I browse to a URL using Firefox, the local browser caching seems to work. The browser uses what it has cached locally and doesnt make a request to the server.p  pHowever, if I press F5 on a page, the browser attempts to refetch the file from the server, and the server subsequently redirects to the module, regenerates the content, and essentially serves it fresh. I would expect IIS to instead return 304 to the client, or serve the content from the cache and avoid calling the module entirely.p  pThe module seems to be returning correct cache headersp  pa hrefhttpwww.mydomain.comSpecialPathFile17aa85bf3bf430066a0524787be6af7b9363c8ae.js relnofollowhttpwww.mydomain.comSpecialPathFile17aa85bf3bf430066a0524787be6af7b9363c8ae.jsap  pCacheControl   public, maxage1800p  pContentEncoding    gzipp  pContentLength  60568p  pContentType    applicationxjavascript charsetutf8p  pDate    Tue, 27 Mar 2012 202542 GMTp  pEtag    17aa85bf3bf430066a0524787be6af7b9363c8aep  pLastModified   Tue, 27 Mar 2012 202543 GMTp  pServer  MicrosoftIIS7.5p  pVary    AcceptEncodingp  pXAspNetVersion    4.0.30319p  pWhen I use F5 the browser request headers also seem to be OKp  pCacheControl   maxage0p  pIfModifiedSince   Tue, 27 Mar 2012 202521 GMTp  pIfNoneMatch   17aa85bf3bf430066a0524787be6af7b9363c8aep  pHowever, if I set a break point, I see the request being passed through to the module. p  p304 is never returned, and neither is the content ever served from the output cache.p  pDo I need to do anything extra or special to get output caching to cache content returned from a custom module p  pIs there something possibly wrong with my headersp

Negative 271 pI managewebmaster half a dozen websites that have facebook like boxes on their index pages. These were all working fine until yesterday, when suddenly they all began to display to the right of the page where previously they had been centered. No changes have been made to any of these pages in the last day or two, so I cant think of any reason why they would all suddenly rightalign. Some of these scripts are between center tags, Others are inside centered tables. But theyre still displaying to the right of the page. Ive tried everything I can think of to get them to display in the middle of the page again, but nothing Ive tried works. Im also curious to know why they would all suddenly lose their center alignment.

Negative 271 pI have three possible designs and Im trying to determine which one is better and in which cases they would be better. The general idea of all the designs is that there is a data object that stores some data and there is an analyzer object that analyzes the data.p  pI need to choose between these designs and I like Design 2 the best. However, a developer Im working with is pushing for Design 3, which I think is the worst. Are there any advantages or disadvantages Im missing for any of the designs Let me know if clarification is needed.p  h2Design 1h2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkRLIc.jpg altDesign 1p  pIn design 1, DataAnalyzer has a Data object that is supplied during construction. When the client calls codedataAnalyzer.analyzecode, the data is analyzed. In this design, each objects responsibility is clear The Data object simply holds data and the DataAnalyzer object analyzes data. Changing the data stored will only change the Data class and adding types of analysis methods will only change the DataAnalyzer class. One problem with this design is that the DataAnalyzer object can only be used for the Data object passed in during construction, so if there are lots of data objects, lots of DataAnalyzers need to be created. Another disadvantage which will be clearer from Design 3 is that the client needs to know about two classes instead of just one. If there are more classes that have an association with Data, the client will have to work will all of these classes.p  h2Design 2h2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxm4ZD.jpg altDesign 2p  pDesign 2 is very similar to design 1, except now DataAnalyzer is reusable for different data objects. The client still has to work with two classes as opposed to one as in design 3. The responsibilities are still very clear and maintenance is easy.p  h2Design3h2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVp9FX.jpg altDesign3p  pDesign 3 allows the client to work with one object. The client can say codedata.analyzecode and not know anything about the DataAnalyzer. Im not sure if this violates the single responsibility rule the Data object has an interface that allows analysis, but the responsibility is really delegated to DataAnalyzer. Another issue is that a DataAnalyzer is created for every Data object created, regardless of whether the Data needs to be analyzed or not. Now if more functionality was added, a lot of things would change. If a DataPrinter class was created lets assume this is better than having the data print the data itself, the client wouldnt have to worry about creating a dataPrinter object and calling codedataPrinter.printDatacode, it could just call codedata.printcode. However, by adding this class I had to change the interface of Data. Adding more methods to any of the DataXX classes causes methods to be added to the Data class.p

Negative 271 pWe recently moved a database from MS SQL Server 2000 to MS SQL Server 2008. Everything works as expected with our main .NET client application but we are having problems with a MS Access 2003 application which connects via ODBC. A System DSN is used to make the connection.p  pWhen the database was running on SQL Server 2000 the Access application would request a user name and password once when the program was first started. Now, with the database running on SQL Server 2008 a user name and password dialog is requested every time a different table is accessed I believe.p  pThis behavior occurs when using either the user account we have used for years and it also occurs if I use the database system admin account  I know this is bad practice, it was just a test. p  pWhat do I need to reconfigure to return to the previous, desirable behavior where the user is only authenticated a single timep

Negative 271 pI have an application that uses SQLiteversion 3.7.2 to store data. I have a SQLite connection shared between multiple threads that writes and reads from the same SQLite db. SQLite is compiled with DSQLITETHREADSAFE1 which means SQLite is in Serialized mode. p  pQuoting from a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgthreadsafe.htmlSQLite docsap  blockquote   pSerialized In serialized mode, SQLite can be safely used by multiple   threads with no restriction.p blockquote  pOn the contrary the a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgcvstracwikipMultiThreadingSQLite Wikia entry says p  blockquote   pDo not use the same database connection at the same time in more than   one threadp blockquote  pI tried with a sample application that spawns hundreds of threads and shares an SQLite handle to read amp write which is working fine. p  pSo is the SQLite wiki entry outdated or SQLite might not be able to handle read and write happening from different threads at the same time using the same connectionp
Negative 271 pI read all the other questions about this, but i cant understand why there is type erasure in my case. I havep  precodepublic ltT extends AclassampBinterfacegt boolean testfinal T param      ...   public boolean testfinal Aclass pOtherPPShape      ...  codepre  pMethod testAclass has the same erasure testAclass as another method in type ClassNamep  pHow should i write two methods that operate on the same class but one with an interface and one not i cant modify the AClass since is from an external library, and have a lot of subtypes with which this code should workp  pIs the use of instanceof right in this casep  pEDIT i use this in a collision test. If the shape passed is instance of an interface, i get a collisionmaskwith a method of the interface and then call the checker, if its not, i want to instantiate a dummy collisionmask that does some different stuff and pass to the same method of the checker that has as parameters the 2 shapes and 2 collisonmasksp

Negative 271 pAt last I have something displayed. Switched to using graphics.GraphicsDevice.DrawIndexedPrimitives ... Next problem... Only one triangle is displayed. The data set is about 200 triangles. I formatted the data coming in to make sure every three consecutive vectors form a triangle face. These are irregular triangles forming an irregular shape. I dont fully understand the indexing of the vertices. Looks like each 3 indices form a triangle. If that is so then the indices match the data coming in.

Negative 271 pIve got everything going great up to a certain point.  I have a form where users fill out their address in form separate fields for street, city, state, zipcode.  Once they hit submit, on the submit button, I have a series of onClick functions.  It consolidates their address fields into one hidden field seperated by commas and spaces like you would handwrite your address.  This works fine.  Then once its consolidated, the next function geocodes the address and returns the latitude and longitude to hidden fields on the form as well.  This works too I think here is the code where I do that.p  precodefunction codeAddress1         var sAddress  document.form.postconsolidatedAddress1.value       var storedLatLng       var lon       var lat       var splittingPoint       var stoppingPoint         geocoder.geocode  address sAddress, functionresults, status             if status  google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK                     document.form.longitude1.value  results[0].geometry.location.lng                   document.form.latitude1.value  results[0].geometry.location.lat                     alertdocument.form.latitude1.value                     alertdocument.form.longitude1.value              else                 alertGeocode was not successful. Please contact the site webmaster and inform them of the following error   status                         codepre  pAt least when it shows me the alerts, it has latitude and longitude in them.  Heres my problem arises though Once I have those values in the hidden field, I need to submit it to a MySQL database to be used for sorting by distance later.  I have structured the database so that the  the latitude and longitude fields are type FLOAT with lengths of 10,6 large enough to contain the returned values Ive gotten through testing.  But when I submit to the database, I never actually get the value, I only get 0.000000.  Ive tried several methods of making the value posted from the form a float, this currently what I have in my PHP where I get the values to submitp  precodelatitude1  floatvalREQUEST[latitude1]  longitude1  floatvalREQUEST[longitude1]  codepre  pIve also triedp  precodelatitude1  float REQUEST[latitude1]  longitude1  float REQUEST[longitude1]  codepre  pNothing ever works...

Since I have an int x on two methods, it doesnt know which to call. My confusion is exacerbated by the fact that when I dop  precode.ajax     cache false,     type POST,     url ApiLocation  Test,     contentType applicationjson,     dataType json,     data JSON.stringify5,     success function response    codepre  pIt still goes to the ReceiveHunk method, with the hunk being null. If I comment out B, ReceiveHunk is still called. Is this related to the fact that Im using JSON instead of form url encoding Do I have to have a separate ApiController for every method that has the same signature Is there some way to configure the routing or whatsit to have the URL include the method name A regular Controller includes the method name in the URL, why doesnt an ApiController Furthermore, if I change either A or B take zero parameters, I simply get an internal server error 500 without any method being called and no exception.

That is codesomefunccode will change codemsgcode. In some cases the changing in question is of the formp  precode    sprintftxt,some text. Not fixed but with a format and variables etc     LogWars,txt   call to some logging function that uses txt     msg  strduptxt codepre  pI know that each call to codestrdupcode should have a related call to codefreecode to release the memory it allocated.p  pSince that memory is used to return something, it should obviously not be freed at the end of codesomefunccode.p  pBut then wherep  pIf codesomefunccode is called multiple times with the emsameem msg, then that pointer will move around, I presume. So the space allocated by the empreviousem call will be lost, rightp  pSomewhere before the end of the program I should certainly codefreemsgcode. In this case codemsgcode is the version that is used as parameter in the calls to codesomefunccode. But I think that call would only release the emlastem allocated memory, not the memory allocated in emearlierem calls to codesomefunccode, rightp  pSo, am I correct in saying that codesomefunccode should look like thisp  precode    sprintftxt,some text.

Negative 271 pHi I wonder if you guys could help please.p  pIm writing a application that is going to live on multiple servers and therefore multiple IPs and instead of using the exact IP and directory structure Id like to just step back a folder from where the application is actually running. So for instance....p  pThe folder structure is p  pcontrols    This contains the aspx file that is going to check if an xml file exists in the blogengine folder.p  pblogengine This should contain xml filesp  pThe code that Im using is......p  precodestring[] filePaths  Directory.GetFiles94.175.237.35inetpubwwwrootmytestBlogEngine, .xml codepre  pWhich will find the files on a particular server but I need to find the files relative to the server that the application is running on, so that I dont have to keep changing the file path. So Id need something likep  precodestring[] filePaths  Directory.GetFiles..BlogEngine, .xml codepre  pBut I cant find the correct syntax in order to do thisp  pDoes anyone knowp  pThanks in advance, Craigp

Negative 271 pIm trying to simplify the development process for a team of eight or nine developers.  As part of this, Im moving our project over to git and Maven.p  pOur project uses some custom Maven goals in order to support our git workflow.  In NetBeans, which is our primary development platform, Im able to configure these custom goals to be triggered via the Custom submenu under the project context menu, which is very friendly and ideal for the undergraduate researchers who come and go on our project.p  pI had omitted codenbactions.xmlcode from code.gitignorecode and, happily, this meant whenever a new developer pulled down the code and opened the Maven project with NetBeans, they got the custom actions which require some scary configuration for free.p  pUnfortunately, when developers configure their rundebug settings and run our project, their rundebugprofile actions emalsoem get added to nbactions.xml, which then gets committed, and hoses everyone elses private workflow when they next pull down the code.p  pIs there a way to separate the actions available in the Custom submenu or some equivalently easy mechanism for triggering specific Maven goals from rundebug configurations such that one can be version controlled while the other is ignoredp  pInsist everyone use relative paths isnt a great answer to start with, but its particularly illsuited for our purposes where folks often have to point their working directory for the VM at different arbitrary directories that they keep according to their own scheme.p

Negative 271 pIs it possible to set the width of a div to be the same as its closest sibling when the width on that div is codewidth autocodep  pIn a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcrmpicco6zCt6 relnofollowmy jsFiddlea you will see that I have a red, green and blue div. I want the blue div to adjust to the size of the green div which is dynamic.

Negative 271 pHere is what Im trying to dop  pMy application has a feature allowing a document generated to be faxed. This feature prints the document to a Printer that is set up in the system as a Fax printer. Its a Brother, and the printer name is Brother PCFAX. Currently, when the print job is initiated, the print driver opens a dialog box for inputting the fax number, cover sheet options, and what not. The fax number associated with the document is stored. I am trying to set up my app to inject the fax number for the user, and click the Start button. The dialog has shortcuts, it initially focuses a button, and the user can press ShiftTAB to get to the number input control, which then accepts CtrlV to paste. Then the user can press AltO to activate the Start button. My previous app version simply copied the fax number to the clipboard, and left the paste and click actions to the user, but Im trying to automate further. My current approach isp  ol liHijack WndProc to answer the WMACTIVATE messageli liIf the Window caption is Brother PCFAX, thenli liUse SendKeys.Send to send TAB, V, and Oli ol  pThis would work, except when the actual fax dialog seems to not register as an actual window, as in, perhaps its just a dialog box child form of the print driver. The only window caption I come up with is the Printing box, which is the small window that pops up everytime you print, on any printer. This does not allow the SendKeys functions to pass through.p  pAny thoughts as to how I should handle this It would be nice if the driver had and SDK that would allow customized command calls, but it doesnt.p

Negative 271 pIve been learning Rails 3 with Devise and, so far, seem to have it working quite well. Ive got custom session amp registration controllers, recaptcha is working and a signedin user can upload an avatar via carrierwave, which is saved on S3. Pretty happy with my progress.p  pNow Im writing Rspec tests. Not going so well I have a reasonable User model test, but thats because I found it online httpsgithub.comRailsAppsrails3deviserspeccucumber and was able to add to it by following Michael Hartls excellent Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial.p  pMy real problem is controller test and integration tests, especially controller tests. Initially I thought Id be able to convert the tests in Michaels book, and I have to a small degree, but its slow progress and I seem to be constantly hitting my head against a brick wall  partly, I think, because I dont know Rspec and capybara so well have made some very dumb mistakes but also because I dont really understand Devise well enough and am wondering if Devise plays as nicely as it might with Rspec I read somewhere that, because Devise is Rack based, it might not always work as one might expect with Rspec. Dont know if thats true or notp  pI know some people will wonder why this might be necessary since Devise is a gem and therefore already tested but Ive had a couple of instances where changes elsewhere have broken login or registration without me immediately realizing. I think a good set of controller amp integration tests would have solved this.p  pIf I was able to do this myself I would and Id publish it for others but, so far, writing these tests has been extremely painful and I really need to move on to other things.p  pIm sure I wouldnt be the only one who could use this.

Negative 271 pMy target is to autoname the output msi file with version number in WIX 3.6 project. I find this link a hrefhttpblog.tentaclesoftware.comarchive2010080599.aspx relnofollowAutomated installer version numbers for WiX, revisiteda but we have a slightly different scenario we dont want to control our product version number by referencing to any assemblys version number. Instead, we just simply want to assign it in wix files. Specifically, I have a wxi file which defines a property like thisp  precodeltdefine VersionNumber  1.1.2000 gt   codepre  pAs a result, I can use this VersionNumber variable anywhere inside our Product.wxs file. But since the easiest way to rename the output msi file seems to be adding a postbuild task in MSBuild, I must pass this VersionNumber out to the MSBuild project file. This is what stops me.p  pI tried the other way around, i.e., to define the VersionNumber constant in the MSBuild and use it inside WIX. It works fine except I must keep this constant the same for different BuildPlatform combinations. We are building our software in VS IDE which means if we modify the version number in IDEs window, it would only apply to the specific BuildPlatform combination and the other combinations will remain unchangedI know if I am building from command line I can simply pass a version number to overwrite the existing one. And that is what I dont want to see. I like the idea to only define the version number in one place to avoid any possible mistake. p  pAny help will be appreciatedp

Since each doubleclick implicitly calls mouseup, I am getting my maximiseminimize functionality interfere with the leftright button click functions.p  pI tried using various techniques like timeout to check if single mouse up is followed by doubleclick as suggested in following thread  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1067464needtocancelclickmouseupeventswhendoubleclickeventdetected10674841067484Need to cancel clickmouseup events when doubleclick event detectedap  pIt did not work for me. Also I have different objects of the view containing the chart on same page so I am attaching unique ID with every event handler to differentiate them I also tried the simple flag set reset method to detect double click and prevent mouseup if double click occured but since in the event hierarchy the mouseup occurs before doubleclick, that failed too.p  pAll in all, Please Help Thanks in advancep

Negative 271 pI work on a project that sits on a largeish pile of raw data, aggregates from which are used to power a publicfacing informational site some simple aggregates like various totals and toptens of totals, and some somewhatmorecomplicated aggregates.  At present we update it once every few months, which involves adding new data, and possibly updating or deleting existing records, and rerunning all the aggregation offline, after which new aggregates are deployed to production.p  pWere interested in ramping up the frequency of updates, such that reaggregating everything from scratch isnt practical, so wed like to do rolling aggregation that updates the existing aggregates to reflect new, changed, or deleted records.p  pCouchDBs MapReduce implementation offers roughly the facility that Im looking for it stores the intermediate state of MapReduce tasks in a big Btree, where the output of maps is at the leaves, and reduce operations gradually join branches together.  New, updated, or deleted records cause subtrees to be marked as dirty and recomputed, but only the relevant portions of the reduce tree need to be touched, and intermediate results from nondirty subtrees can be reused as is.p  pFor a variety of reasons, though uncertainty about CouchDBs future, lack of convenient support for nonMR oneoff queries, current SQLheavy implementation, etc., wed prefer not to use CouchDB for this project, so Im looking for other implementations of this kind of treeish incremental mapreduce strategy possibly, but not necessarily, atop Hadoop or similar.p  pTo preempt some possible responsesp  ul liIm aware of MongoDBs supposed support for incremental MapReduce its not the real thing, in my opinion, because it really only works well for additions to the dataset, not updates or deletes.li liIm also aware of the a hrefhttpwww.cl.cam.ac.ukey204teachingACSR20220122013papersS4ProgrammingpapersbhatotiaSOCC2011.pdf relnofollowIncoopa paper.

Negative 271 pMy application takes in input parameters from UI and executes a set of SQL queries that would return data for the jquery datatables.

Negative 271 pI have a database on a cpanel server, which contains a user field called password. When I look at the field through phpmyadmin, all the passwords appear as md5 encrypted. p  pSo for example, a password thats 12345 would be encrypted and appearing in the database as e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e. Now, on the original server, thats ok, because even if the password is encrypted in database, when I enter the password on the related website as 12345 it recognizes it and gives access.p  pThe problem is when I export and import the database. After importing the same database into another server, naturally the password values are still encrypted in the database. But, when I try logging in into the related website, the decrypted password, tht is, 12345 does not work anymore. I have to enter the password as e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e and only then I can login. So Im guessing the problem is that the data in the password column is not getting decrypted after importing to another database, hence when I enter 12345 instead of the extended md5 value, it does not match and gives me a wrong password error.p  pSo can anyone help me solve this issue I am supposed to migrate this website on another server, and its a school system, and currently none of my users have access because of this issue.p  pThanks. p

Negative 271 pI have an application that uses a class to create a complete MySQL database for use by the application. The class uses a separate method for creating each table.p  pA dialog is used to allow the creation of the tables since there are tables for different uses that are created in groups. The underlying code for each group create button executes the table creation methods from the class mentioned above in succession.p  pEach table creation method uses two queries. The first isp  pDROP TABLE IF EXISTS tablenamep  pThe second query is the table definition CREATE TABLE ...p  pIf the database is empty, the tables are all created successfully. p  pIf the tables exist and Im recreating the tables from scratch, I receive an error errno 121 when trying to recreate the tables. This is curious since NONE of the tables being recreated have a PRIMARY KEY and NONE have a foreign key Im assuming that the errno 121 coming up because the table still appears to be there even though its been dropped.p  pIf I drop the tables manually using MySQL Workbench and run the table creation again, all is well and all the tables are created successfully again.p  pIt would appear that the DROP TABLE query is not being completed or visible to the program before the CREATE TABLE query is being run. The DROP TABLE is eventually successful because the table no longer appears in the database when I check in MySQL Workbench.p  pI use the same MySQL command object to run both queries. After execution of the DROP TABLE query, I change the CommandText property for the CREATE TABLE query. Ive also tried this with a different MySQL command object with a different MySQL connection object with the same results.p  pAny idea why the DROP TABLE query is not being completed or recognized before the CREATE TABLE query p  pIm running MySQL 5.1.39 on Windows 8 same results on Windows 7 with MySQL ConnectorNET 6.5.4 in Visual Studio 2008 in C.p  pAs requested by SH below, here is the code for one of the tables a small one.

Negative 271 pIm trying to write a contact form for a company that uses the Movable Type platform. Im in the process of creating page templates for them to use.

Instead I get a huge block of all my php text. The html renders just fine. I am unsure of how to force MT to recognize the php. I cant find a setting or anything that directly addresses this problem. The closest I can find in the MT helpfaq areas is a hrefhttpmovabletype.orgdocumentationappendicesmodifiersencodephp.html relnofollowherea.

Negative 271 pHope someone can help  apologies for this very basic question, but Im using standard C to write code for some experiments with PIC microcontrollers, and Im very new to the C Language.p  pI have various logical groups of code, such as functions to control an LCD display, that Id like to make reusable to PICbased projects and would like to know how best to breakup these logical code groups for reusability.p  pIn the example of the LCD functions, I presume I split the declarations into a header named lcd.h including in Header Files project directory of my IDE and the function definitions in an include lcd.c including in Source Files project directory of my IDE  would this be correctp  pWhat are the naming conventions for breaking up code in this way For instance should all global declarations be in a header file named main.hp  pMany thanks, Alexp

Negative 271 pWhat kind of program use connection less and connection oriented communication I know this is a simple questions but I have no idea where to find anything.p  pI thought that applications like Skype or a VPN could use connection oriented services because they would require a direct constant path to the destination so that there is a minimal amount of packet loss and all packets come in order.p  pBut what applications could use a connection less oriented service I thought maybe a connection of a video game server or a database server. p  pI would appreciate some feedback on this.p  pThank you.p

Negative 271 pWhile loading my [animated] slideshow I want to show the credits [in plain text] of the cooperators of the show and enable the viewer to go to full [black] screen as is recommanded. Now, these credits have to disappear [fade out] as soon as the first image of the show appears on screen, although some overlap seems acceptable for me. Since loading time is different for different browsers and also depends on broadband connection speed, clientshardware, etc., I want to ensure the viewer [client] has enough time to read the credits, say at least 5 seconds. p  pLogically this seems easy enoughp  ppage loading time [LT] here defined as the interval between opening of new browser window [which gets focus] and the appearance of the first image of the show [randomized] reading Time [RT] for local client [viewer], say 5 seconds ..SetTimeout variable [ST] adding surplus time, in case  LT lt 5  Of course, here I do need a reference point from which to count, but how do I calculate LT as defined, which is probably not the loading time of the full page. p  p1 in case LT  RT [loading time exceeds reading time] I still want the credits to stay on screen, otherwise the black screen  is too boring, or the viewer may think that the show has crashed. [this option seems to be captured by the onLoad statement see below].  So,in this case ST  0p  p2 in case LT lt RT or avoiding the credits flash away before the viewer can read it.    In this case the viewer views the show more than once [what Im aiming at btw] and is then cached  by the browser next time she starts the show.    If so, then ST  RT  LT, which forces the credits to continue superimposed on the images since the page is already loaded. p  pad 1 MS Internet Explorer seems to ignore ST, once the show is cached. Since I cannot control the clients browser settings I dont know how to cope with this problem. The beginning of the show is the only place to show the credits, since the show never ends.p  pad 2 Sometimes Firefox continues to load the show for some reason [though the images are already displayed] or waiting for the server. The credits are  displayed by far too long, due to the onLoad statement, I guess. So, how do I stop the display of the credits in this case p  pMy examplep  precodefunction verbergid     document.getElementByIdid.style.visibility  hidden     setTimeoutfunction verbergid,5000   have to replace the fixed number by [ST]  . .  ltheadgt     ltbody  onloadsetTimeoutfunction verbergloading,5000gt    . ltdiv styletextaligncenter idloadinggtcredits...........ltdivgt codepre  pView [just the beginning of] my show in full screen [no user interaction is required]p  precode[httpwww.atelierfransvandestaak.nlslideshow.html][1]    [Chrome, Firefox, Safari]  [httpwww.atelierfransvandestaak.nlieslideshow.html][2]   [Internet Explorer] codepre  pIn [1] a live videostream is inserted, which is not supported by internet explorer and so in [2] is replaced by a snapshot from the same camera point of view.  p  pI would appreciate your advise for a crossbrowser solution, if there is one.

Negative 271 pIm new to using Rx and Ive been trying to rewrite my MVC w Service Layer emNOT ASPem to use this awesome newfangled Rx. I have a class called codeRemotecode which encapsulates a codeNetworkStreamcode. The codeRemotecode uses Rx to listen to bytes from the codeNetworkStreamcode and once it works out its received a full message worth of data, it decodes that data into an codeIMessagecode.p  pI get how I can read from the codeStreamcode continuously using Rx from inside the codeRemotecode, but how do I publish decoded codeIMessagecode from that stream to the outside world from the codeRemotecode Am I supposed to use the classic evented style in C and have the consumers of the events use codeObservable.FromEventcodep  pI only ask because Ive read around that codeIObservablecode is not meant to be implemented anymore.p

I believe its because I only stringify the coderequestcode object literal once, right before the clientside hash is calculated. Then, the coderequestcode object is in JSON format as part of the codepayloadcode. Once received by the server, the hash is created directly from the JSON object received in the payload, theres no second codeJSON.stringifycode method invoked, so the signature always matches because the order of the properties is determined once, by the client. Ill keep looking into this though as it seems like a weak point, if not a security concern.p

Negative 271 pWe have a web application thats built on top of Play framework 1. The current version of Play is 1.2.7. Its running on top on Ubuntu 12.04 in an Amazon EC2 instance.p  pRecently we experienced a peculiar and very worrying behaviour on our test server. There were only a few people using the system a few developers and a few testers. What happened was that the session cookie of one user was given to two other users. Suppose you have users A, B and C using the system, each logged in as themselves. Suddenly what happens is that all of them seem to be logged in as user A, without any of them doing anything special.p  pPlay is managing its own session cookie. Suppose the session cookie name is configured as XYZSESSION. When we saw this behaviour, I was able to inspect the session cookies of users A and B C was in a different organization and site. The session cookie that B had was 100 same as A had. In this application, the session cookie is used to store user name, email address etc. So in practice, user B was suddenly having the same session as user A. I didnt inspect the cookie of user C, but the verbal report was that he suddenly was logged in as user A.p  pThis was actually a second time this behaviour was observed with this application. The previous time was several months ago, and then a cludgy hack was developed to notice the situation and logout the user in question. However, the hack is not very maintainable or scalable, and we want to get rid of it. And preferably find the root cause for the issue.p  pThe authentication logic of the application is implemented using OpenID4Java. However, when this behaviour occurred, all users were already logged in. p  pWe have a theory on the possible cause of this behaviour. In the application, we have a BaseController class that inherits Plays Controller class and that is used as the base class of all controllers. In the BaseController there is some code that gets and puts to the session container. In the code of that class, the session is referred to as just session, which means the static field in Plays Controller class. The assumption is that Plays enhancer will enhance the reference to use a ThreadLocal field in Scope.Session class. The enhancing would be done by Plays ControllersEnhancer class. However, when inspecting the code of method enhanceThisClass in ControllersEnhancer, it makes use of CtClassgetDeclaredMethods. In the comments for that method it says The inherited methods are not included. I dont fully understand how enhanceThisClass gets called, so Im not entirely sure how solid the theory is.p  pSo, our suspicion is that in practice Play skips enhancing the code in this BaseController class, and the static session field in Plays Controller class gets used as plain as it is, and this combined with suitable scheduling of threads will cause the session duplicationp  pThe problem is quite difficult to reproduce and thus we havent this far conclusively verified that this is the cause for the behaviour we observed.p  pAnybody have any insights Have seen similar behaviour with Play Able to prove the theory right or wrongp

Within this python script there is a subprocess.Popen call to run several other batch files. However for the past couple days Ive noticed that the task has successfully run however the secondary batch files did not. I know the python script ran successfully due to the logs it created and all the files it makes that the secondary batch files use are all there. However the completed files are not. p  pIf I just run the batch file by itself everything works perfectly.

Negative 271 pToday my build eninge RTCJazz build engine makes trouble  i start a build and it abondons the buildp  precodeThis build has been automatically abandoned by the build engine vis1adaBuildEngine. This can happen if the build engine stops while it is processing a build, or if it fails     to communicate with the server e.g. due to the server crashing, or a network     break. As a result, the build is left in the inprogress state.  Such builds are automatically abandoned for the following reasons 1. When the build engine is restarted, new builds will be processed, however the old     builds would otherwise remain in the inprogress state indefinitely. 2. As a result the build engine would appear as busy when it is not. codepre  pi cant tell why its not working anymore  i have another build engine running on my build server and this works fine  also other build definitions work on the buggy build engine fine, so what could be the reasonp  pThe build definition itself hasnt been changed for a longer period of time...p

Negative 271 pI know that a generic type will not be shared among instances of different close constructed types. This means that for a generic class codeCltTgtcode which has a static field codeXcode, the values of codeCltintgt.Xcode and codeCltstringgt.Xcode have completely different, independent values.br In my case I really need to have a static field shared between instances with different generic arguments. The only solution i found was emdefine a nongeneric base class to store your static members, then set your generic type to inherit from this type.embr The problem is that my class is already inherit from other .net class.br Is there other way to solve thisp

Negative 271 pI have a rather theoretical question Is multiplying y by 2x and subtracting y faster than  multiplying y by [2x1] directlyp  pcodey2x  ycode vs codey2x1code p  pI implemented a moving average filter on some data I get from a sensor. The basic idea is that I want to average the last code2xcode values by taking the old average, multiplying that by code[2x1]code, adding the new value, and dividing again by code2xcode. But because I have to do this more than 500 times a second, I want to optimize it as much as possible. I know that floating point numbers are represented in IEEE754 and therefore, multiplying and dividing by a power of 2 should be rather fast basically just changing the mantissa, but how to do that most efficiently Should I simply stick with just multiplying code2x1code, or is multiplying by code2.0fcode and subtracting y better, or could I even do that more efficiently by performing a leftshift on the mantissa And if that is possible, how to implement that properly Thank you very muchp

Negative 271 pI am having trouble with below scenario.p  pThere is a record lock on a file MYFILE from Program A. Later Session gets disconnected abruptly with a record lock on MYFILE and it executes cancel handler routine. In cancel handler program routine Program B it tries to delete the record locked in MYFILE and session hangs because the file MYFILE is compiled with WAITRCD time of NOMAX. Now nobody can access the account for any update action from other sessions as well.p  pProgram flow is given belowp  p.... .... Program A Record lock .... Program X Cancel Handler OVRDBF WAITRCD3 added .... Program B Session Freeze After adding OVRDBF above, session didnt freeze Program C Session Freeze happens  I still see the overrides are there and its the same default activation group and no commitment control and no triggersp  pScenario here is Record lock by the same jobsession.p  pI have tried below solution to fix the issuep  pIn cancel handler program Program B, I did a OVRDBF with WAITRCD of 3 to 5 seconds. Later executed above steps and when it came to cancel handler program, it tired to delete the locked record and after 3 to 5 seconds, it continued processing with next steps and wrote error message for locked record. There was no screen freeze. Later it went on to execute another program C where it tried to delete the locked record in MYFILE. But now the session hangs again. p  pI have checked the call stack and all the programs are under Default activation group and there is no committment control and no triggers. Any idea, why it overcame the record lock situation from Program B and not from Program C. Please let me know. p  pRegards, Surip

Negative 271 pIm starting to use MEF with my MVC application, so that it follows SOLID priciples.p  pI asked this question last week a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27493203shouldadependencybeinjectedmanylevelsupthanitisneededShould a dependency be injected many quotlevelsquot up than it is neededa and part of what I asked in the comments was, if you have two constructorsp  blockquote   pOne constructor for Dependancy Injectionp      pAnother construtor with no parametersp blockquote  pAnd the contstructor with no parameters instantiates instances of the dependancies needed, then this should make a Service Locator moot.

Negative 271 pIm new to asynchronous programming in C and Im still confused about a few things. Ive read that after .NET 4.5, the APM and EAP are no longer recommended for new development since the TAP is supposed to replace them a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryjj152938vvs.110.aspx relnofollowsourcea.p  pI think I understood how asyncawait works and Id be able to use them for performing IO operations that have async methods. For example, I could write an async method that awaits for an HttpWebClients GetStringAsync result, since its declared as an async method. Thats great.p  pMy question is what if we have an IO operation that happens in a method that is not declared as async Like this suppose I have an API that has a methodp  pp  precodestring GetResultFromWeb codepre  pp  pwhich queries something from the Web. And I have lots of different queries to do and I strongmuststrong use this method to do so. And then I need to process each query result. I understand that Id do this if that was an async methodp  pp  precodeTaskltstringgt getResultTask  GetResultFromWebmyUrl   Do whatever I need to do that doesnt need the query result string result  await getResultTask Processresult codepre  pp  pBut since its not, I cannot await for it  it tells me string is not awaitable. So my question is is there any way of performing these IO operations asynchronously without having to create one thread for each query If I could, Id like to create as less threads as possible, without having to block any of the threads.p  pOne way I found to do so was by implementing APM, following a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163467.aspx relnofollowthis articlea from Jeffrey Richter and then, in my Begin method, I call ThreadPool.QueueWorkItemGetResultFromWeb, asyncResult. Like thisp  pp  precodepublic class A      private void DoQueryObject ar         AsyncResultltstringgt asyncResult  AsyncResultltstringgt ar         string result  GetResultFromWeb         asyncResult.SetAsCompletedresult, false           public IAsyncResult BeginQueryAsyncCallback         AsyncResultltstringgt asyncResult  new AsyncResultltstringgtcallback, this         ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemDoQuery, asyncResult         return asyncResult           public string EndQueryIAsyncResult ar         AsyncResultltstringgt asyncResult  AsyncResultltstringgtar         return asyncResult.EndInvoke       codepre  pp  pThen I use an AsyncEnumerator and begin BeginQuery several queries and process the results as each one of them finishes using yield return  EndQuery. This seems to work well. But after reading so much that APM is obsolete, I was wondering how could I do this using TAP. Also, is there any problem with this APM approach p  pThanks p

Negative 271 pI am looking for advice on how to resolve the following issue.p  pAs part of a volunteering project I have automated an Excel spreadsheet using VBA. I have written a lot of code that includes user forms and classes. p  pI would like to allow other volunteer to access the spreadsheet and make some changes to the content just the content, not the VBA code. Their editing may have to be done through VBA user forms. p  pThe easiest way to allow this is to install a remote control software like Team Viewer and distribute the access codes to the volunteers. Unfortunately this would not be the optimal solution for security and continuity reasons.p  pDoes anyone know a better way to allow users to edit a spreadsheet from remote that does not cost a fortunep

Negative 271 pWe recently upgraded our solution to the new Managed ODP.Net v4.121.2.0, from v4.121.1.0 and have come across a problem with udpating to CLOB fields when the field has between 1001 and 4000 characters. When you attempt to do that an error ORA1461 is thrown from ODP.Net.  p  pRun the same code and data, using the earlier version of ODP.Net and it works fine.  Also, you can insert records with 1001 and 4000 characters, you just cant update them.p  pIve created a sample program in C that demonstrates the problem.  The program does the followingp  ul liIt creates a 3 column table, one column a CLOB, in the database li liIt creates an inmemory .Net DataSet object to match.li liCreates a new record in the DataSet with 1400 characters in the CLOB field.li liSaves the DataSet to the database with an INSERT statement.li liUpdates the CLOB field in the DataSet with some new data, again 1400 characters worth of data.li liSaves the DataSet to the database, and the ORA1461 is thrown.li ul  pI dont have an Oracle Support account, so where do you report to Oracle problems with ODP.Netp  pSample C code that demonstrates the problemp  precodeusing System using System.Data using System.Data.Common using System.Diagnostics using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client  class CLOBTest      string TableName  CLOBTEST     string ServerName  servername     string UserName  username     string Password  password      public void CLOBTest1               Create a physical data table, if needed, in the Oracle DB that has the CLOB column         CreateTable           Create a dataset for the CLOBTEST table, fill it with a new row         DataSet CLOBInfo  BuildCLOBTestDataSet         DataTable CLOBTable  CLOBInfo.Tables[TableName]         DataRow CLOBRow  CLOBTable.NewRow         CLOBRow[ACTIONCODE]  DateTime.Now.ToStrings         CLOBRow[DESCRIPTION]  CLOB Slim Test           The size of text in the CLOB field is critical to reproducing this defect.

Negative 271 pFirst of all let me be clear I dont know anything about Maya. A guy at the office wants to spawn random particles in a field. Then he gives them a random rotation vector so that they look in random locations. He wants to attached people to the particles and move them like that. The question is how to move the particles in the direction of the rotation vector they have been assigned on creation. If someone here knows Python or MEL i would greatly appreciate the help. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis is the code that orients the particles in a random way.

Negative 271 pI recently migrated my NetBeans Platform NBP based application from Ant to Maven. I pretty much figured Maven out but theres one thing I still cannot get my head around, and that is the version systemconvention.p  pIt seems that everyone in the Maven world with a large Maven project consisting of multiple modules uses a parent pom in which they define a version, which is then inherited by all child poms i.e. all NBP Modules in Maven NetBeans RCP project.p  pFor instance, take a look at the final result of the example project in the maven book a hrefhttpbooks.sonatype.commvnexbookreferenceoptimizingsectfinalpoms.html relnofollowhttpbooks.sonatype.commvnexbookreferenceoptimizingsectfinalpoms.htmlap  pYou will see one version defined by the parent POM,p  precodeltgroupIdgtorg.sonatype.mavenbook.optimizeltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtsimpleparentltartifactIdgt ltpackaginggtpomltpackaginggt ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt codepre  pwhich is inherited by each child module, by specifying the parent and not using any  tag of its ownp  precodeltparentgt     ltgroupIdgtorg.sonatype.mavenbook.optimizeltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtsimpleparentltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt ltparentgt codepre  pand for its internal within the project dependencies each child module defines this relative to the projectp  precodeltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtproject.groupIdltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtsimpleweatherltartifactIdgt             ltversiongtproject.versionltversiongt ltdependencygt codepre  pThis means that you cannot update one module to a higher version because it will then look for dependencies with the same version number, which dont exist. Not to mention that using a separate version for any of your child modules gives you headaches when using the versionsmavenplugin because you end up micromanaging your dependencies. p  pThis seems to completely go against the AutoUpdate  Lifecycle  Release philosophy of the NetBeans Platform. There I could update one module and generate a new updates.xml Package as NBMs and when uploaded to an AutoUpdate repository, a client will see just that one update. It seems that if you do it the Maven way codemvn nbmautoupdatecode, strongallstrong modules get a version bump so that the whole model of auto updating via modules goes down the drain.p  pI hope I am mistaken and there is somewhere a feature to restore the great autoupdate functionality that comes with the platform, some kind of extra version number that automatically gets added to the major.minor.revision number or some intelligent way to override codeOpenIDEModuleSpecificationVersion  major.minor.revisioncode in between releases versions. Is there or do I have to release a new version of my application for each tiny update to a client modulep

Negative 271 pWhen you lock a computer on windows 7 your login screen appears on your main display and then on other monitors it is completely black, when your displays are extended. This problem is fixed when you duplicate displays, because when you lock your computer that picture and login screen appears on both. I want that for more or less a better look to my computer. I know this is technically not needed but I liked the idea. So I created a batch file that is called DuplicateOnLock. All it says is thisp  pDisplaySwitch.exe clonep  pThis bat file works if I just run it myself. So I set it up in Task Scheduler that when I lock my computer it triggers a run of this command. I do know the path is right because if I run it manually the task it will run and duplicate my displays. I also gave the task the highest admin capabilities. I also have another command that when I unlock the computer it Extends my screen. Also that bat file says isp  pDisplaySwitch.exe extendp  pOnce again this runs fine. Has all the same settings as the one above except it runs on unlock and this is not running as well. I believe this is not working because the computer is locked and the command is not working because my computer is simply locked and on the desktop and windows just discards it. I think would be a very neat trick if I could get it to work. If anyone has any ideas on why this is happening and can help me come up with an idea I would great appreciate it.p  pI did try delaying the command as well to see if that fixed the issue. Sadly that did not.p

But meanwhile my account seems really messed up from all the testing and deleting and wiping off iCloud data from the device and so and since you can not delete containers and do kind of fresh install it is really bit messed up. And I am confused about documentary. It says somethig like use custom containers if multiple apps share same container. But does multiple apps mean he same app on different devices Or do they mean really different appsp  pAm I right Is that the difference of default vs custom containersp  pSo when I want to sync the same app across different devices I have to go with custom containerp  pThanks for help p

Negative 271 pIs there a way to share core library between Java processes or other way to minimize JVM initial memory impactp  pSo heres my case. Im playing with microservices. Im runing quite a lot of them. Im setting their heap for code128Mcode as its enough for them. But Ive noticed that the Linux process is consuming much more.p  pIf I understand correctly from a hrefhttpsplumbr.eublogwhydoesmyjavaprocessconsumemorememorythanxmx relnofollowhereap  precodeMax memory  [Xmx]  [XXMaxPermSize]  numberofthreads  [Xss] codepre  palthough I am using Java 8 so probably perm size is no longer the issue or is it.p  pThere is initial core JVM memory footprint... and I was wondering if you heard a way to somehow share that core memory between processes as its really the same. Or any way to deal with that extra cost when running many processes of java. p

Negative 271 pI used the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9692962flasksqlalchemyimportcontextissuethisa question to fix a circular import when setting up FlaskSQLAlchemy.  The solution works because you dont have to import the codeappcode from the codeapplication.pycode file to get the database URI  it initalizes the connection just before running the app.  The issue now is that I typically like import my codemodelscode file into a python interpreter just so I can test the models and the connection to the database without actually running the app.  But with this setup, just importing codemodelscode wont establish a connection to PostGres.p  pIs there a way to establish a connection to PostGres through codeFlaskSQLAlchemycode without actually initializing and running an app  Maybe I can provide codedbcode with the URI to my database directlyp
Negative 271 pIm having trouble trying to figure out why my LibGDX game only runs successfully once on Android.p  pAssuming the game has not been installed on the device, when I run the application from eclipse the game runs fine.

To make sure I am using the correct keys required by the DLLs, I have set up a resource file. I will have the Russian developers edit the resource file to make sure the strings are correct. It would be nice if after they edit the file, they could immediately test the changes with the application I have built, hence the question about users editing resources. If they cant do this, then they will have to email the new resource file, so I can include it in the next build.

Or we can use strongA.lookupstrong for each key in B.p  pHowever, the problem is that both join and lookup for PairRDD is stronglinear scan for each partitionstrong. This is too slow. As I desire, each partition could be a Hashmap, so that we can find the key in each parition in O1. So the ideal strategy is that when the master machine receives a bunch of keys, the master assigns each key to its corresponding partition, then the partition uses its Hashmap to find the keys and return the result to the master machine.p  pIs there an easy way to achieve itp  pOne potential way As I searched online, a similar question is herep  pa hrefhttpmailarchives.us.apache.orgmodmboxsparkuser201401.mbox3CCAMwrk0kPiHoX6mAiwZTfkGRPxKURHhn9iqvFHfa4aGj3XJUCNgmail.gmail.com3E relnofollowhttpmailarchives.us.apache.orgmodmboxsparkuser201401.mbox3CCAMwrk0kPiHoX6mAiwZTfkGRPxKURHhn9iqvFHfa4aGj3XJUCNgmail.gmail.com3Eap  pAs it said, I built the Hashmap for each partition using the code as followsp  precode val hashpair  A.mapPartitionsiterator gt       val hashmap  new HashMap[Long, Double]      iterator.foreach  case key, value  gt hashmap.getOrElseUpdatekey,value       Iteratorhashmap   codepre  pNow I get 100 Hashmap if I have 100 partitions for data A. Here Im lost. I dont know how to ask query, how to use the stronghashpairstrong to search keys in B, since hashpair is not a regular RDD. Do I need to implement a new RDD and implement RDD methods for hashpair If so, what is the easiest way to implement join or lookup methods for hashpairp  pThanks all.p

Negative 271 pIve already asked for something here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29907858aspmvc5updateviewinresponsetowebservicerequestsASP.MVC 5  Update view in response to web service requestsa AND I got the answer for most important question however I have another one related to this.p  pI have 2 projects in my solution actually more but others are irrelevant in this case  ServiceStack web services which is library type of project and MVC application. I would like to use mvc apps functions or variables so share MVC projects memory with web service. I can do this if I move web services classes into the main project but I would like to keep it separated. I, of course, already added web services project reference into main project MVC but I cant add main project references info web services project because it says that it cannot be done because it would result in circular dependencies, which isnt anything strange.p  pWhats the best solution to either share memory between these projects or provide a communication channel between them. I dont want to, for example, make requests to my controllers public methods. I know that when you face circular dependencies it means you did something wrong while designing a solution but in this case these 2 projects are separated only to separate web services classes from the main project.p

Negative 271 pIm using the Foursquare API to get locations of specific stores in a small region. I have a list of districts and cities in which I want to find stores. For this reason, Im doing the queries to the venues search endpoint with parameter emintentbrowseem and providing emnearDistrict, City, Countryem, without providing a radius parameter because I dont know the size beforehand. Often, the query returns with code strong200strong and a list of venues or an empty list venues if it doesnt find any location in the area, but sometimes the query returns an error code strong400strong saying emMust provide parameters ll and radius or sw and ne or near and radiusem. p  pProviding a radius parameter does make the query return an empty list of venues as expected. I dont understand why sometimes the query doesnt complain about omitting the radius parameter. Should I always provide a radius parameter, even when doing so may restrict my search areap

We appreciate that PSO management has been forthcoming in providing all the requisite information. This has enabled PACRA in forming the right ration opinion.ltbrgt             PACRA has decided to hold PSOs rating with AA category. This category captures credit worthiness of very strong enterprises. Within the category though, the rating has been revised to AA [Previous Rating AA]. This primarily captures the uncertainty emanating from circular debt, of which PSO has become an inseparable part. This is likely to persist until structural reforms are implemented.ltbrgt              At the same time, the rating incorporate PSOs leading position in the OMC sector, its stateoftheart

If anybody knows how I could do this, or has another solution wrapping pushes some of the lower rows off the screen so that doesnt work it would be appreciated.p  pThank youp  pEDIT clarifying my question, Currently these gridview cells down this column have scrollbars to manually scroll if necessary.

Negative 271 pI am a complete newbie to Windows development and test platforms. I am working on a legacy MFC based GUI application and looking for tools that would help with automated testing of the UI. A whole bunch of tools came up when I searched but most of them dont seem to support MFC.p  pThe options I considered were  a. Coded UI UI Automation  Seems like a good fit but not supported in Visual Studio Professional 2012 which is my dev env. b. Google test  no MFC support  Pls share any pointers if you think otherwise  c. TestStack White  The open source tool built on top of Coded UI but doesnt seem to be actively supported anymore. Couldnt find any documentation on current version or if it is still actively supported.  d. Develop my own TestInterface and modify the existing ViewWindow  classes as described here a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.comtestingdontdevelopguiteststeachyourappto240168468 relnofollowhttpwww.drdobbs.comtestingdontdevelopguiteststeachyourappto240168468a . Not in favor of such a major change at the moment and would like to try some tool which can at least automate the basic features.  p  pCould you pls share your experience with any of these or other tools for testing MFC apps.   p  pPS I did see other posts like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26058560mfcguitestablewithgoogletestMFC gui testable with google testa but didnt get the answers I was looking for. It is the purely visual aspects of the tool that I am looking for automation and the functional logic is already well covered. p  pThanks in advance VeeAaaKayp

Negative 271 pI have made a number of Python scripts that allow the user to explore an equation using matplotlib.widgets such as the Slider and the RadioButtons. p  pI would like to send these simulations to my colleagues, but they are busy people and running a Python script is an insurmountable hurdle for them. So, I would like to be able to send my program in another format, ideally, as an html page that they could simply open in their browser and still play with the sliders and buttons. p  pAt first, I was very exited to discover projects like a hrefhttpioam.github.ioholoviews relnofollowHoloviewsa and a hrefhttpsjakevdp.github.ioblog20131205staticinteractivewidgets relnofollowipywidgets.StaticInteracta, which do allow you to embed interactive elements in an iPython notebook. However, these require that every possible plot be pregenerated as an image. So, if I have numerous sliders I often have 10 sliders and generate 4 plots, then the file would quickly become enormous.p  pa hrefhttpbokeh.pydata.orgenlatestdocsuserguideinteraction.htmlcutomjsforwidgets relnofollowBokeha has a nice demonstration of interactive sliders on the web, but the calculations are done by the server, and I do not have my own web server. Bokeh also offers the option of a hrefhttpbokeh.pydata.orgenlatestdocsuserguideinteraction.htmlcutomjsforwidgets relnofollowcreating custom Javascript actionsa, which generates an html file which works exactly like I want. However, it seems that I would need to do all of the calculations to update the plot in Javascript, and I do not know Javascript.
