Positive 88 pSetting Im using the YouTube Iframe api to embed a YouTube player in my page. I load a playlist into this player. On mobile when I press the play button on the video it goes into fullscreen mode and plays that video. When that video finishes it exits full screen and goes back to the web page view. p  pProblem I want the player to continue onto the next song in the playlist. Ive tried adding code in the onPlayerStateChange function so that when the player state changes to ENDED I call a player.nextVideo function. This does not work. Ive tried using a button to call the player.playVideo function. This does not work. p  pIt seems as though the only way to get into the full screen player is to click on the play button on the video display. If it would just stay in full screen mode and continue onto the next video that would be just as useful.p  pDoes anybody know how to achieve this functionalityp  pHeres my entire page documentp  pdiv

Regardless off if I use portrait or landscape the used thumbnail is codehqdefault.jpgcode which is very lowres, extremely blurry text for example.p  pSo the Nexus 6, having a resolution of 2560x1440 prefers a hrefhttpsi.ytimg.comviMbhVgK0WgAEhqdefault.jpg relnofollowhqdefault.jpga over both a hrefhttpsi.ytimg.comviMbhVgK0WgAEsddefault.jpg relnofollowsddefault.jpga and a hrefhttpsi.ytimg.comviMbhVgK0WgAEmaxresdefault.jpg relnofollowmaxresdeafult.jpga.p  pIs there a bug with embedded iframes and HiDPI devices or is there a way, which I havent found yet, to prefer higher resolution thumbnails by default Or perhaps something else Im doing wrong.p  pAll suggestions are appreciated.p

Positive 88 pIm trying to use ContentSecurityPolicy CSP headers for a site that has social media buttons youtube, twitter, facebook. However these widgets run scripts on a poorly specified list of 3rd party sites. The social media sites dont specify all the sites their scripts will access and so you need to run your page and onebyone look and see the domains that were blocked, then add them to the CSP header.p  pThis seems very fragile. If the social media sites change their scripts and add new domains, the page will break because the browser will block access to the new domain.p  pCSP is very effective in stopping XSS, but it seems social media sites do not provide buttons  widgets designed to work with it. At a minimum, they should require only ONE domain and should specific what that domain is.p  pI end up with a CSP header likep  pContentSecurityPolicy defaultsrc self a hrefhttpswww.google.com relnofollowhttpswww.google.coma a hrefhttpcsi.gstatic.com relnofollowhttpcsi.gstatic.coma a hrefhttpwww.googleanalytics.com relnofollowhttpwww.googleanalytics.coma a hrefhttpsapis.google.com relnofollowhttpsapis.google.coma a hrefhttpsaccounts.google.com relnofollowhttpsaccounts.google.coma a hrefhttpsplatform.twitter.com relnofollowhttpsplatform.twitter.coma a hrefhttpswww.youtube relnofollowhttpswww.youtubea.   com a hrefhttpplatform.twitter.com relnofollowhttpplatform.twitter.coma imgsrc self data a hrefhttpswww.google.com relnofollowhttpswww.google.coma a hrefhttpwww.googleanalytics.com relnofollowhttpwww.googleanalytics.coma a hrefhttpssl.gstatic.com relnofollowhttpssl.gstatic.coma a hrefhttpsssl.gstatic.com relnofollowhttpsssl.gstatic.coma data stylesrc self a hrefhttpsfonts.googleapis.com relnofollowhttpsfonts.googleapis.coma unsafeinline fontsrc self a hrefhttpsfonts.gstatic.com relnofollowhttpsfonts.gstatic.coma datap  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 88 pIm betting that someone has already solved this and maybe Im using the wrong search terms for google to tell me the answer, but here is my situation.p  pI have a script that I want to run, but I want it to run only when scheduled and only one at a time.  cant run the script simultaneously  p  pNow the sticky part is that say I have a table called myhappyschedule which has the data I need and the scheduled time.

But I dont want to populate ViewData[UserNickname] in each and every action of every controller, so I decided to use a hrefhttpwww.asp.netLearnmvctutorial13cs.aspxthis approacha and create an abstract base controller which will do the work for me, like sop  precodepublic abstract class ApplicationController  Controller              private IUserRepository repUser          public ApplicationController                      repUser  RepositoryFactory.getUserRepository             var loggedInUser  repUser.FindByIdUser.Identity.Name Problem             ViewData[LoggedInUser]  loggedInUser               codepre  pThis way, whatever my deriving Controller does, the user information will already be present.p  pSo far, so good.

Negative 88 pIm abusing C templates a little and Im having trouble figuring something out.  Lets say I have two types that really should be inherited from a base type, but for speed reasons, I cant afford to have the virtual function overhead Ive benchmarked it, and virtual calls ruin things for me.p  pFirst, here are the two classes I havep  precodetemplateltclass DataTypegt class Class1      Lots of stuff here   templateltClass DataTypegt class Class2      The same stuff as in Class1, but implemented differently  codepre  pIn a typical oo design, codeClass1code and codeClass2code would inherit from codeIInterfacecode and I could have a function that looks like thisp  precodeDoStuffIInterfaceamp MyInterface   codepre  pBut I cant do that, so Ive done thisp  precodetemplate ltclass Cgt DoStuffCamp c   codepre  pI know its not pretty, as theres nothing at the compiler level to enforce that codeClass1code and codeClass2code implement the same interface, but for speed reasons, Im breaking some of the rules.p  pWhat Id love to do is create a call back function on codeDoStuffcode, but I cant figure out how to make it work with the templates especially since theres the hidden  in there.p  pFor example this works right nowp  precodeDoStuffchar filename      switch figure out the type i need to make          case 1 return DoStuffClass1ltintgtfilename     case 2 return DoStuffClass1ltdoublegtfilename        templateltclass DataTypegt DoStuffDataType pdata      return DoStuffClass2ltDataTypegtpdata   templateltclass Cgt DoStuffC c    c.Print  codepre  pNow I know youre asking, why use codeClass1code and codeClass2code  Well the underlying difference between dealing with a file and dealing with memory is so big, that it makes sense to have different classes for the different type of input rather than just overloading the constructor and having it behave differently for the different inputs.  Again, I did benchmark this and its much faster to have the special cases handled in their own classes rather than having codecasecodescodeifcodes in every function.p  pSo what Id like to do is hide a lot of this implementation from the junior developers, I dont want them to have to create three different overloaded codeDoStuffcodes to handle the different inputs.  Ideally, Id just set up some type of callback with codedefinescode and all theyd need to do is something like create a class called codeDoStuffcode and overload the codecode operator and have the functor do the work.p  pThe trouble Im having is that the codeDoStuffcode function that does the work is only templatized by codeltclass Cgtcode but C itself is templatized by codeltclass DataTypegtcode and everything I cant figure out how to pass everything around in a generic way.  E.g., I cannot use codetemplate ltclass CltDataTypegtgtcode or codetemplatelttemplatelt class DataTypegt class Cgtcode.  It just wont compile.p  pDoes anyone have a good trick to have a generic call back, either a function or a functor I dont care, with this nested templated class  Basically I want something where I can write a generic function that doesnt care about the class thats storing the data and have that called by a mostly common function that figures out which class to use.p  precodeBigSwitchCallBack,Inputs      switchsomething          case 1 return CallBackClass1ltTypegtInputs     case 2 return CallBackClass2ltTypegtInputs       codepre  pThis way I can write one codeBigSwitchcode function and have other people write the CallBack functions.p  pAny Ideasp  phr p  pEDIT for clarification for Jalfp  pI have two very similar classes, codeClass1code and codeClass2code which represent basically the same type of data, however the data store is vastly different.  To make it more concrete, Ill use a simple example codeClass1code is a simple array and codeClass2code looks like an array however rather than storing in memory is stores in a file because its too big to fit in memory.  So Ill call them codeMemArraycode and codeFileArraycode right now.  So lets say I wanted the Sum of the arrays.  I can do something like thisp  precodetemplate ltclass ArrayType, class ReturnTypegt ReturnType SumArrayType A      ReturnType S0     for int iA.beginiltA.endi            SA[i]          return S  codepre  pBut now, I need a way to load real data into the array.  If its a memorybased array, Id do thisp  precodeMemArrayltDataTypegt MpData codepre  pand if its filebaaed, Id do thisp  precodeFileArrayltDataTypegt Ffilename codepre  pand both of these calls are valid because the compiler generates both code paths at compile timep  precodedouble MSSumltMemArrayltDataTypegt,doublegtM double FSSumltFileArrayltDataTypegt,doublegtF codepre  pAll of this assumes that I know what the DataType is, but for a file based array, I may not know the data type until I open the file and query the header to know what kind of data is in the array.p  precodedouble GetSumchar filename      int DataTypeCodeGetDataTypeCodefilename     switch DataTypeCode          case 1 return SumltFileArrayltintgt,doublegtFileArrayltintgtfilename     case 2 return SumltFileArrayltdoublegt,doublegtFileArrayltdoublegtfilename       template ltclass DataTypegt double GetSumDataType pData      return SumltMemArrayltDataTypegt,doublegtMemArrayltDataTypegtpData  codepre  pAll of this works, but it requires writing two overloaded codeGetXcode functions and a codeXcode function for everything that Id want to do.  the codeGetXcode functions are basically the same code everytime except for the codeXcode that it calls.  So Id love to be able to write something likep  precodedouble GetXCallBackType X, char filename      int DataTypeCodeGetDataTypeCodefilename     switch DataTypeCode          case 1 return XltFileArrayltintgt,doublegtFileArrayltintgtfilename     case 2 return XltFileArrayltdoublegt,doublegtFileArrayltdoublegtfilename       template ltclass DataTypegt double GetXCallBackType, DataType pData      return XltMemArrayltDataTypegt,doublegtMemArrayltDataTypegtpData  codepre  pso that I could callp  precodeGetXSum,filename codepre  pthen later when someone else wants to add a new function, all they need to do is write the function and callp  precodeGetXNewFunction,filename codepre  pIm just looking for a way to write my overloaded codeGetXcode functions and my codeXcode functions so that I can abstract way the inputstorage from the actual algorithms.  Normally, this isnt a hard problem, its just that Im having trouble because the codeXcode function contains a template argument that itself is templated.

Negative 88 pHeres my story, Sort of long  please bear with me  p  pI am currently the only programmer here, no much designing to do  yet. When I started, we had no source control,  files where edited directly from a development server  which used rsync to sync to production servers. p  pI have not had much experience doing this kinds of thing  this is my first job im 19  but what I have setup sort of works, but I dont know if it will work easily when coolaborating with a designer andor more programmers.p  pMy IDE is Zend. Project is an SVNchecked out project. p  pWhen I need to make a change, I do so, save it and hit my local computer that has apache setup to read from those files in that project. Mostly they are Webservices or just 1 file  not whole projects. p  pI got started on another project that required me to use a full domain name because it required parsing subdomains so I setup my local apache to use that domain name, even though it wasnt pointed to me. Using foxyProxy and making http.domain.com and a hrefhttpdomain.com relnofollowhttpdomain.coma as one rule and pointing it to 127.0.0.1  this allows me use the www.domain.com but hit the dev machine which is mine. p  pI commit the changes, and run this sort of ghetto bash script that checks out the code off SVN and syncs to all the servers using RSYNC.p  pWell, soon we will get a designer to work with me. My code is split into a sort of View Controller system  strongBut i dont use any php templating systemstrongp  pIve got a buddy that works at this other company.

It is configured using an HTTP Proxy server.

Negative 88 pSo weve hired a company to migrate our three websites from custom built CMS solutions to Typo3.  One of our sites is still in classic ASP while the other two are in ASP.net 1.1 amp 2.0.  Typo3 wasnt my choice, but the choice of those with the purse strings.  Anyway, the migration of the sites is progressing but I have a problem that nobody seems to be able to answer. How do we handle page redirectsp  pFor example, on our classic ASP site, we have a lot of tracking links from our newsletters 7 years worth that have urls like tracklink.aspID23421  How can we handle these links on the new PHP setup that Typo3 is running on  I can build a PHP page to handle the classic tracking similar to the PHP page, but if you go to the .asp page in the example above, we get a 404 error, even if the page is there, since by default, the system doesnt handle ASP pages.  Is there a way to do some sort of redirect that will still pass the querystring variable to the new PHP tracking page  Also, well need to do this with our .aspx pages on the .net sites as well.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 88 pDue to incomplete understanding of eclipse infrastructure I have one problem. Historically we have one ugly thing in our build procedure. It looks like followingbr  After eclipse builds entire workspace there is one incomplete thing in local build of plugins. It is some data file which is currently built during execution of special plugin test which is actually tests nothing, but do generation of necessary data. It isnt necessary to execute that test after any change in workspace. Actually that needed only after changes in parts of code which is touched very rarely. But if changes in that parts of code are made then the build became unusable before update of that special data file. That file is now stored on CVS since now it can be created only locally, but its necessary in product build.br  I want to change build procedure in such way that this plugin test will be executed during workspace build procedure so it will be unnecessary to have manual runs of it. Ive tried to write ant file which will run that test using templates from org.eclipse.testlibrary.xml, but the plugin didnt loaded. I dont know why this happens, but Im afraid that this can happen due to absence of test plugins in my working copy of eclipse.br  Ive read some articles about running plugin tests in batch mode, but they only strengthen my feeling about necessity of separate eclipse copy for testing developed plugins.br  Were using ant for plugin builds and the entire structure of these scripts is very complex, so I think it will be impossible to make global changes in build procedure on top level. Which options do I have to finish my task Maybe someone already had a similar experience...p  pPlease note, that in fact I want to get rid of that test in favor of some special eclipse application, but I think it isnt important right now, since I believe that my problem can be more general than running plugin tests.p

Dont forget, this is a completely random example.p  pSo, if I were to try to do this, I guess I have the following questionsp  ol lipstrongHow do I create the white canvas for drawing everything uponstrong Some answers to my first question suggested using WPF, and I want to try that. Is there a specific control I need to add to the XAML to allow me to render such dynamic stuff on top of itpli lipstrongHow can I drawpaint figures like these onto the canvas, and how can I change this during runtime panningzoomstrongpli lipstrongDo I need to create a simple coordinate plane for referencing and storing all the objects and their locationsstrong inside the house If so, howpli ol  pI hope this isnt too general still, as I think that using such an example would allow people to effectively answer this question. Thanksp

Negative 88 pLooking at the OpenID protocol, it appears that the relying party needs to send a request to the identity provider.  In our situation, this is not exactly ideal since the identity provider is behind a firewall our server will not be able to make the request.

So my question is this does OpenID support an identity provider behind the firewall  If not, is there a secure way of accomplishing thisp  pEDITp  pThe client has a web server behind their firewall. They have employees that visit our website and thus are able to visit our site and their webserver which resides behind their firewall our server, however, would not be able to.

Negative 88 pIm working on a library where Im farming various tasks out to some thirdparty libraries that do some relatively sketchy or dangerous platformspecific work.  In specific, Im writing a mathematical function parser that calls JITcompilers, like LLVM or libjit, to build machine code.  In practice, these thirdparty libraries have a tendency to be crashy part of this is my fault, of course, but I still want some insurance.p  pId like, then, to be able to very gracefully deal with a job dying horribly  SIGSEGV, SIGILL, etc.  without bringing down the rest of my code or the code of the users calling my library functions.  To be clear, I dont care if that particular job can continue Im not going to try to repair a crash condition, nor do I really care about the state of the objects after such a crash Ill discard them immediately if theres a crash.  I just want to be able to detect that a crash has occurred, stop the crash from taking out the entire process, stop calling whatevers crashing, and resume execution.p  pFor a little more context, the code at the moment is a for loop, testing each of the available JITcompilers.  Some of these compilers might crash.  If they do, I just want to execute codecontinuecode and get on with testing another compiler.p  pCurrently, Ive got a codesignalcodebased implementation that fails pretty horribly of course, its undefined behavior to codelongjmpcode out of a signal handler, and signal handlers are pretty much expected to end with codeexitcode or codeterminatecode.  Just throwing the code in another thread doesnt help by itself, at least the way Ive tested it so far.  I also cant hack out a way to make this work using C exceptions.p  pSo, whats the best way to insulate a particular set of instructions  thread  job from crashesp

Negative 88 pI have an application that receives a pointer to JPEG data from a camera API wrapped with ctypes, converts it to a wx.Image, and displays the images as a movie.p  pOne of required features is to set two of the components of a pixel equal to the third. E.g, my pixel in RGB format is 100,200,255, I want to set the the R and B values equal to the G, or 200,200,200. I need to do t his for every pixel in the image whilst maintaining a decent framerate.p  pI can access the RGB values from my wx.Image by calling the Image.GetData, which returns a string containing the pixel values in the following format RGBRGBRGB ... I have implemented the feature naively by iterating through this RGBRGBRGB string. p  pHowever, this naive approach is far too slow to achieve a decent FPS because I thinkp  pa I am iterating through every pixel in the image.p  pb I am doing too much data copying.p  pI have considered converting my RGB data to numpy, performing the operation I assume numpy would have a faster way of doing this sort of thing, and then converting back to wx.Image. Unfortunately I cannot convert straight from the raw data to numpy as the data comes as a JPEG, not in as a RGB bitmap. So I would need to go from datawx.Imagenumpy arraywx.Image.p  pI have also considered implementing my own python buffer which will return, for example, the G pixel value instead of the R and B values when being read. I think this would be the ideal solution, as it requires no data copying or excessive iterations, but I have no idea how to go about doing this. Will I need to write this buffer in C Is it possible to implement buffers in pure python and still manipulate raw memory p  pSo SO, how do you think I should go about improving my performance Should I attempt the numpy or buffer solution, or is there an easier solution that I am missingp  pI am mainly looking for ideaslinks to relevant documentation or examples, but if someones wants to write some code then thats fine p  pThanksp

I navigate to the view with the table and it displays the data correctly there with the UISwitches all in the correct position given the data some on, some off. When I tap one of the switches, then click the segmentedcontrol that does the filtering, the data reverts back to the state it was loaded in, implying that the flipping of the switch did not actually effect the data at all even though I dont think I did a deep copy anywhere here so I figured it should be doing the right thing.

Negative 88 pFolks,   I am building a RESTful service that is secured by providing an XMLDSIG XML signature at the bottom of the XML document. When I send this document to the server, the WCF service is doing the XML deserialization method on the HTTP payload to give me a C class.

Negative 88 pBoth Developer Express CodeRush and Whole Tomatos Visual Assist X are excellent tools. Ive found that CodeRush has a prettier UI, and its marker mechanic is extremely useful, and it has a larger palette of refactorings available. On the other hand, CodeRush occasionally makes mistakes with its refactorings, particularly when working with C projects. Therefore I usually disable CR there. VAX doesnt have near the number of refactorings as CR does, but they all consistently work. VAX is also much better at unobtrusively making Visual Studio better  doing things like improving features that already exist, instead of CRs method of almost building an IDE inside of an IDE.p  pLong story short, I like both tools, and would like to use both tools. The problem is that they do a few things that conflict. I would like to set things up such that whenever there is a conflict between a CodeRush command and a Visual Assist command, the VAX command wins. Is there an easy way to do thisp

For example the speed in ms of the ascentdescent. I set it to a speed of 0 for flat dives for now but that doesnt feel right.

Negative 88 pLong time reader, very first question.  fsi.exe is a .NET executable and therefore contains its own assembly complete with all the yummy methods and whatnot fsi uses to execute F scripts.p  pLooking at the assembly in .NET Reflector pick your class, but Shell is the best example reveals a bunch of garbage names that look like decorated C functions say, from Dependency Walker.  Incidentally and slightly beside the point, F assemblies compile in much the same way, with lots of garbage names, which leads me to think fsi.exe was written in F, perhaps as a proofofusabilityp  pAnyway, heres my question  has anyone delved into fsi.exe and figured out how to embed it into a .NET application  Because Id like to use F as a scripting language, but programs compile to surprise programs, and scripts must be executed by fsi.exe, which is unacceptable in my domain I need a persistent VM.

Negative 88 pI have the following setup Spring  JPA  Hibernate  PostgreSQLp  pIve created a service layer which offers some Transactional methods to insert data. The data is in the concrete case a person entity which has to be connected to a category entity identifying relation and some picture entities non identifying relation.p  pAs I have to offer a importer Ive created a method also Transactional to import a csv file. This method trys at first to insert the categories which works well using em.persist which is used from the DAO that is called by the service layer. Then I add a new person which becomes connected to the category I added before the category gets loaded like it were already in the database  HQL query, which also works as the category is persistent in the running transaction. The person entity also uses em.persist to get persisted in the transaction.p  pNow I create the picture entities and connect them to the person entity. After connecting them, I also save the person, but as it is already persisted in the transaction I use em.merge. Here I get a EntityNotFoundException as hibernate or jpa could not load the category from the first step it has a correct id, but it seems it couldnt see the transaction...p  pAll three methods insertCategory, insertPerson and addPicture are also declared as Transaction as they are used seperate in the normal use case.

However I also have a consolidation job which has to wait until all of the parallel jobs are completed and perform the consolidation.p  pEg br Job A  Job B, Job Cbr Job B  Job D, Job Ebr Job C  Job Fbr Job F, Job E  Job Gbrp  pAfter Job A is done, Job B and Job C are to be triggered. Job D amp Job E will be triggered after Job B is completed and similarly Job F is triggered after Job C is completed. and Job G is to be triggered after Job F amp Job E are completed. p  pI notice that Job G is triggered twice after completion of each of the dependent jobs Job F, Job E. Is there any way I can ensure that Job G runs only once but after completion of Job F and Job E.p

Negative 88 pWithin Excel, I use tables to store dynamic data inside a seperate worksheet. Entering new data works like a charm, however, I would like to be able to dynamically retrieve a single row from that table and store its data in variables. I would prefer to build a function so I could do something like thisp  precodefindFromCatsByDatesearchterm returns a single row if found with mathing date. codepre  pNote that the table is dynamic and not a fixed range so it changes vertically. I want to reuse this function with slight modification on other tables. I kind of need an example how to achieve this in VBA.p  pThanks,p
Negative 88 pOur project has about 20 developers, but our application makes relatively light use of databases. We have a collection of about 5 databases, all of which are very small and would have less than 20 tables each, none of which have millions of rows or anything large.p  pWe have two options on the table for how to manage the evolution of the databases over timep  ul liSome kind of tool. Currently were using Visual Studio database projects, which contain the current definition of the schema, and look at a reference database to generate a diff script. We then use this diff script to bring the reference database up to date.li liUse version scripts to build the database from a baseline. The scripts are manually placed in source control. Any data migration to move data from old columnstables to new would be part of these scripts. There would be a version recorded in the DB somewhere and upgrading would run all scripts between DB version and the current version.li ul  pThe second option seems to be widely used and I have found an indepth discussion here a hrefhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20080131versioningdatabasesthebaseline.aspxhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20080131versioningdatabasesthebaseline.aspxap  pThe problem we have with what weve got at the moment is that we dont have access over our Production databases. This means to create a release package, we have to restore a backup of Production into another location, generate a diff against that referece DB and give the script to the production DB team. So our release to production is different to our other environments.p  pThis makes the idea of running versioned scripts appealing because we use the same scripts in all environments, and theres no adhoc work in deployment eg manual restore of prod to reference DB. But given that we have such a small scale DB situation, I feel like we can hardly be a difficult case for the DB tools out there. What we want is something as simple as possible which is easy to understand.p  pDo the tools such as RedGates suite make sense for this kind of scenario, or should we go with versioned scripts Cost isnt so much of an issue, its more about creating a Pit of Success where maintaining and deploying the DB is as basic and automated as possible.p
Negative 88 pI need opinions on the best way to go about creating a table or collection of tables to handle this unique problem. Basically, Im designing this site with business profiles. The profile table contains all your usual things such as name, uniqueID, address, ect. Now, the whole idea of the site is that its going to be collecting a small string of informative text. I want to allow the clients to be able to store one per date, with as many as 30 days in advance. The program is only going to show the information from the current date on forward, with expired dates not being shown.p  pThe only way I can really see this being done is a table consisting of the uniqueID, date, and the informative block of text, but this creates pretty extensive queries. Eventually this table is going to be at least 20 times larger than the table of businesses in the first place as these businesses are going to be able to post up to 30 items in this table using their uniqueID. p  pNow, imagine the search page brings up a list of businesses in the area, its then got to query the new table for all of those ids to get that block of information I want to show based on the date. Im pretty sure it would be a rather intensive couple of queries just to show a rather simple block of text, but I imagine this is how status updates work for social networking sites in general Does facebook store updates in a table of updates tied to a users ID number or have they come up with a better wayp  pIm just trying to gain a little more insight into DB design, so throw out any ideas you might have.p

Negative 88 pIm currently learning game programming using a framework called libgdx. It allows users to make programs that can easily run on both a Java virtual machine on the desktop and an Android mobile phone. I am trying to make a basic program that will display a character on screen and allow me to move it back and forth with the keyboard. I have created 3 classes  one called codeAssetscode, which loads files into the memory and converts them into Textures and Animations, one called codeInputHandlercode, which responds to key input by changing animations, direction of movement etc., and one called codeFightViewcode, which is essentially where all the rendering gets done. The codeInputHandlercode is called from the codeFightViewcode class with the typical command codeinput  new InputHandleranim, framecode. The constructor for codeInputHandlercode looks like thisp  precodepublic InputHandlerAnimation animation, TextureRegion region      Assets.load  loads textures from files into memory and creates animations from them     animation  Assets.playStance  set initial animation to be used     region  animation.getKeyFrame0, true    make TextureRegion equal to first frame in animation   codepre  pNow, what I want to happen is simply that the Animation and TextureRegion passed into the constructor are set to the values quoted above, so that, for example, if I was to mention coderegioncode in the codeFightViewcode class after codeinputcode had been declared, it would be set as codeanimation.getKeyFrame0, truecode. From my limited experience of Java this is what I believe should happen, but I get a NullPointerException at compile time pointing to the second line in the code belowp  precode    input  new InputHandleranim, frame     x  centreX  frame.getRegionWidth  2 codepre  pClearly, codeframecode is still null, even after being passed through the constructor, which as can be see in the third line in the constructor should assign to it a value. Note that before being passed into the constructor they both are actually null  I am trying to create a class that will give the fields data without needing to do so in the codeFightViewcode class.p  pAny help appreciated. This could be the wrong way to go about this  what I am trying to do is create an object that, upon initialisation, will load the codeAnimationcode and codeTextureRegioncodes with data.p

Negative 88 pHeres my use case.  We are trying to narrow down a potential memory leak in an application, and we are using a memory analysis tool to snapshot the heap so we can look for object instances and references.  In case it helps, were using YourKit.p  pThis application makes extensive use of dynamic and CGLIB proxies, which end up storing tons of references to classes and classloaders in WeakHashMaps.p  pAfter our test case runs, we are expecting all hard references to object X and its classloader to be gone, but since there were many proxies involved in the test case in the end we have many weaksoft references left to it.  I can only find WeakHashMap references, but YourKit wraps both weak and soft references into one line item in the summary so I cant be sure Im not missing a soft reference somewhere.p  pThis is true even after requesting a full GC from the JVM.  Using the sun 1.6.023 JDK in server mode.p  pIt emseemsem as though the JVM admits there are only weaksoft references to these objects, but I cant get force it to GC these things to be 100 sure.  So, what I want is for this to disappear entirely from the heap and its classloader usage of permgen to also go away.p  pAnyone know of a way to configure andor force the JVM to dispose of objects only softweakly referencedp

Negative 88 pI have a large amount of data that I am pulling from an xml file that all needs to be validated against each other in excess of 500,000 records. It is location data, so it has information such as county, street prefix, street suffix, street name, starting house number, ending number. There are duplicates, house number overlaps, etc. and I need to report on all this data such as where there are issues. Also, there is no ordering of the data within the xml file, so each record needs to be matched up against all others. p  pRight now Im creating a dictionary of the location based on the street name info, and then storing a list of the house number starting and ending locations. After all this is done, Im iterating through the massive data structure that was created to find duplicates and overlaps within each list. I am running into problems with the size of the data structure and how many errors are coming up.p  pOne solution that was suggested to me was to create a temporary SQLite DB to hold all data as it is read from the file, then run through the DB to find all issues with the data, report them out, and then destroy the DB. Is there a bettermore efficient way to do this And any suggestions on a better way to approach this problemp  pAs an fyi, the xml file Im reading in is over 500MB stores other data than just this street information, although that is the bulk of it, but the processing of the file is not where Im running into problems, its only when processing the data obtained from the file.p  pEDIT I could go into more detail, but the poster who mentioned that there was plenty of room in memory for the data was actually correct, although in one case I did have to run this against 3.5 million records, in that instance I did need to create a temporary database.p
Negative 88 pDoes anyone know how images are loaded per browser For inline images, do two calls to the same image trigger two server requests or just one How are subsequent calls to an image that has been downloaded handled  p  pFor CSS images, are all images called within your CSS loaded when the CSS file is called or is it when individual classes calling the images are used As an extreme example, if I have a CSS file that calls 200 separate images but only one of those images is called on the first page load, do all 200 get called or just the one How does loading differ by browser if any  p

Negative 88 pOut of pure curiosity In VB.net, I tested concatenating 100k strings and found out one thread alone did it in 23 milliseconds.  Two threads each concatenating 50k then joining the two at the end took 30 milliseconds.  Performance wise, it didnt seem beneficial to utilize multiple threads when dealing with only 100k concatenations.  Then I tried 3 million string concatenations and two threads each handling 1.5MM always demolished one thread handling all 3 million.  I imagine at some point using 3 threads becomes beneficial, then 4, and so on.

Negative 88 pWe have a desktop client with several hundreds of users in our company. Sometimes it throws exceptions and crashes, but its been hard to get the users to report their issues.

Negative 88 pIm working on the mathematically modeled piano synthesizer. Right now Im using modal based approach, where the sound is formed by a sum of exponentially decaying sinusoids harmonics. p  pRight now I can calculate frequencies of sinusoids taking inharmonicity into account, of course. For initial amplitude values Im using data obtained from a real piano samples, since it is just easier right now. I dont care about phases just jet.p  pMy main concern is decay rate. To simulate beating and two stage decay I use 2 or 3 exponents of about the same frequency depending on the number of strings for a particular note.p  pFor a case of 3 strings theory suggests that one of the exponents will decay faster and two will decay at about the same rate, but due to slight difference in frequencies they will produce beating. p  pThis method is described in the literature, but no algorithm is given to obtain actual values.p  pAt the moment I use simple formulas that Ive created myself and they are not based on any physics at all, but produce decent sound after a lot of trial and error.p  pMy question is is there a method to calculate those decay rates based on a more physical approachp  pKey moment  method should produce values for the decay rates before synthesis itself occurs, so methods based on building system with feedback that reproduce this behavior wont work for me.p

Negative 88 pI created a mobile site in html and jquery, but it is not loading properly in Chrome or on an iphone.  There is no backend to the site  all changes to content would happen right through editing the html.  Inside of my html, I made no specific reference to ajax.  And, each page links through pageid.  The problem is that as I navigate the site, various pages do not display correctly unless I hit refresh.  URL is mobile.shorelinelake.com. I am VERY new to this, so please be patient with a newbie   Thanks for any helpp  pa hrefhttpmobile.shorelinelake.com relnofollowhttpmobile.shorelinelake.coma  if you click through to Lake and then Sailing, or Cafe to Menu, you can see the problem  the page jumps after loading, cuts off the header, places content below the footer, or will entirely hide jquery elements...p

Our customers have been notified that there will be a short outage period between certain dates so thats ok, but I guess what Im saying is I cant stop the SQL Server Agent right now just to copy log files and such for testing purposes.p  pAny helpadvice is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 88 pIve created a Messenger library and Ive made it thread safe so it can be shared around between threads without worry. I achieve this mostly using the Monitor class.p  pI have a Logout routine which can take some time to complete because it tries to wait for transactions taking place before it shuts down the socket etc. Its asynchronous and has BeginEnd methods, but for this example well just pretend its synchronous.p  pWhat if two threads call Logout, one right after another What should I be doing with the second threadp  pCurrently I block using Monitor.Wait to wait for a Pulse from the first thread until the first logout completes and then throw a AlreadyLoggedOutException.p  pIve also toyed with having a LogoutInProgress exception thrown if Logout is called but a logout is already taking place.p  pBoth seem to have advantages and disadvantages, but Id like to know what other people think is best.p

To that end, Ive succeeded by shuffling an array, and then codegotoAndPlaycodeing the label in the first element of the array, and then removing that element. At the end of each ad is codegotoAndPlay1code with all the main code being on the first frame.

Further, I dont want the last element in the array to be the same as the first in the new one, so the same ad wont ever show twice in a row. Im trying to have it detect if the element it just used matches the one its about to use, and reshuffle if that happens, but in my testing it continues to occasionally show the same ad twice in a row.p  pIm obviously doing something wrong, but being entirely new to ActionScript3 and in fact to flash Im having a lot of trouble identifying what it is.

Negative 88 pI am working in a project where each user has a big avatar and a thumbnail of this avatar. The avatar is 150x215 and the thumbnail is 50x50. To generate the thumbnail, the user selects a square area inside the avatar and the system crops and resizes the avatar to generate the thumbnail.p  pNow I need to have a 70x70 thumbnail. I cannot resize the 50x50 thumbnail because it does not look nice. My idea was to create a tool to find the thumbnail inside the avatar and, using the thumbnail location, generate the new 70x70 image. It was working well until I notice that some thumbnails are not only cropped, they are resized. When the image is resized it loses pixels what makes a pixelbypixel comparison impossible so I cant detect the thumbnail location inside the avatar.p  pIs there any way to identify where the thumbnail is locatedeven though it is resized I am using a hrefhttpwww.emgu.comwikiindex.phpMainPage relnofollowEMGUa to handle the images.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 88 pSo, I am in the process of globallocalizing an asp.net mvc3 website and have a list of cultures I need to support. Every one has worked well so far but, I have not been able to get the spanish Latin American culture code to work. It appears that it is not supported by microsoftp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusgoglobalbb896001.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusgoglobalbb896001.aspxap  pIs there a way to circumvent this I know I can add each of the specific country cultures but that actually will not work specifically in chrome when the browser is set to esla. If I do not find a reasonable workaround for this it is becoming a defect. p  pI would be happy to add any additional detail required. Any help is greatly appreciated. Even if the answer is that I cant really workaround it.p  pThanks.p

Negative 88 pI often find myself transferring workspaces to different scratch drives etc when one computing system is downbusy, or, I want to run two longwinded packages simultaneously to save time and loading the same workspace twice in different places.p  pBecause of this, Id really love a way to see the different objects between workspaces and a way to combine them, adding only the new, changed or updated workspace objects to a similar workspace. This would be extremely useful for me. p  pSo far I am relying on manual notetaking and getting befuddled with my scribbles two weeks down the line. I really just want to learn so good working practices and habits that make this sort of this easier. p  pGenerally I would really like to learn more about workspace management and how experienced users keep workspaces for long, ongoing projects comprehensive and tidy. I often use Rstudio but working remotely or using our HPC system it can be a bit laggy and clunky so I tend to use command line and interactive sessions.p  pI think maybe making lists of objects might be the key, but Id like to be able to annotate things more easily, maybe with the data and parameters used to make the object etc. p  pThanks.p

Negative 88 pSay you have to call a web service from an ASP.NET page. If you just call it asynchronously it is of no use becausep  pThe CLR Threadpool thread that would not get freed.

I called it Stack Blur because this describes best how this  filter works internally it creates a kind of moving stack  of colors whilst scanning through the image.

Negative 88 pI have an environment where Im building several library solutions in TFS.  At the end of the build process the script packages them into a NuGet package and pushes them to our local feed.p  pNow we can include these libraries, which change little daytoday, in our upstream projects.p  pThese libraries as well as our upstream projects generally are branched at the same version.  Basically the trunk is our evolving latest version. Say before branching the trunk is 3.0.0.123, 123 being a running build number.  At some point we mark the current trunk as what were going to release and branch it.  The version number of the trunk at the time of the branch becomes the version of that branch and we would increment the version in whatever appropriate manner for the trunk to what we would feel is likely going to be the next release say 3.1.0.456.p  pThis presents a slight oddity to how wed like to use NuGet.  We would want that the branch, 3.0.0.456, use the lateset library from the branch perhaps 3.0.0.457 and the trunk to use the latest from the trunk 3.1.0.789p  pSo what this basically boils down to is can we setup the versions for a solution using NuGet to be similar to the manner NuGet uses when defining dependencies within a packagep  pIdeally, Id like to tell the branched upstream application to use [3.0.0.456, 3.1 and the  trunk to use latest no version. In this scenario it would pick up the branch would pick up the next branch build 3.0.0.457 and the trunk would pick up whatever the last NuGet package that was published to the feed.p  pThe only idea that Ive come up with as a possible solution is using parameters for the build template and using that to update the package.config file before the NuGet targets are run.p  pemI appologize if this should go on SuperUser or elsewhere...emp

And I am not sure which technology from azure I should use...p  pBefore I am starting to read deeply into the topic, I want to be sure, that I am reading into the right one...p  pI want to create an application that should be able to be used by a lot of customers. so its important that its very easy that 100 and also 1.000.000 users can communicate with the service. azure is scalable easily, so thats why I decided to use azurep  pEach customer can buy a subscription and is then able to connect to the service with its username and id. p  pEach customer can connect to the service with different clients e.g. browser, windowsclient, iOS, android, ....p  pWhat I already know is how the data layer data access components connect to azureSql, ... and the business layer will work. business layers application facade is there in C.net and will be able to run in an azure appp  pWhat also doesnt matter is the client side.p  pI just have to figure out, the communication between the business facade and all the external systems, that will use them i.e. clientsp  pSo What shall I use as Technology for the Services Layer Which message types,... p  pImportant is, if one of the many endusers is communicating through two different clients with the same username and password with the service, and the client lets say is changing something through the business layer, so that data that will be presented on each client has to be changed, the other client has to receive that change pretty instantly. simultaneously one change from one client, will affect all the other clients from one users that are connected at that moment if they are not connected, they will get the Change at the next Login...p  pWhat I mean by that is, it just should not matter at all which client the customer is using or if more than one, it shouldnt matter as well p  pBecause every client is offering the same functionality anyhow there is a login, and after that the user will se some data and can process that data..p  pIt would be perfect, if someone who is experienced in messaging and communication can help me out, by telling me the right way to go... p
Negative 88 pI have two threads and a flag that gets set by the second thread. I could use an codeatomicboolcode, but I want to be able to wait for the flag being set on the first thread. How can I do thatp  pI cant use a codeconditionvariablecode I guess, because if the second thread calls codenotifyonecode before the first thread starts waiting, the thread wont wake up. p  pAlso, checking if the flag has already been set should be reasonably fast. I guess this should be rather simple, but Im just stuck, so Im asking here. Thanks in advance.p  pEdit Block of course, not busywait. Sorry if that wasnt clear.p

Allows me to specify multiple templates for one class  Allows me to generate code and resources  Allows me to generate a base class to targetgeneratedsources and a dummy implementation to srcmainjava which simply extends the base class If the dummy class in srcmainjava exists, nothing happens, if it doesnt it generates such a dummy class. This code is checked in to the SCM and allows extending the generated classes manuallyp  pI am using the Flexmojos GraniteDS plugin for generating my ActionScript model code, but its pretty specialized for that particular purpose. p  pI think such a generic generator would make things a lot easier.p

I checked all the sizes in the HTML and they are set to the correct sizes. I cant figure out why this is happening, especially after I went back and reset all the settings to their original ones.

Negative 88 pIve been having a lot of strange problems while trying to write a raytracer in an opengl shader. I try to determine if the source of the error is myself, and often this is the case, but Ive come to the conclusion that some of these problems may just be bugs in my graphics driver Im on ATI. In these cases, Ive just implemented workarounds. p  pBut I just ran into something Im not sure how to work around At least without really weird code, the fact that I cant switch over some of my data from uniform arrays to texture buffers, because the moment I delete the references to the uniform array which doesnt do anything anymore Ive removed any actual usage of the data, my shader goes from

Negative 88 pIm looking at creating a standalone utility that displays user friendly  error messages for debugging issues related to code signing and deployment  that are typically encountered during IOS development. p  pIt should programatically start by opening a provisioning profile chosen by  the user, inspect each of the certificates in them, dig out the public  key used in each of the certificates, find out if the appropriate private  keys are present in the keychain and then see if the raw materials are in the right places. If something is missing or out of place it should  display very a clear message to the user. If all is fine, it should  display the certificate to use along with the chosen private key from the keychain.p  pTo achieve this, how would I programatically extract the public keys  from inside the certificates and inspect the keychain for private key  matches Any pointers would help.p  pPS I know XCode does some of the above but it is not as  friendly as it should be and the I think mysteries related to the black box codesigning approach needs to be unraveled and democratized.p

Negative 88 pOk, so I need to store ages in a database. There are no DOBs because the data set is animals with an age estimate. The ages can be days, weeks, months or years. What is the best way to store this We have 1 year, or .5 year 6 months, or 952.17307... for 9 weeks, and that is how it is stored now. So for anything under 1 year, the entry person needs to calculate the age in this way. Trying to figure out a better way than this mess. Suggestionsp  pThanksp
Negative 88 pIve been teaching myself how to code in C and utilize GTK for writing applications in Linux, using Glade to design the UI before implementing it. Ive been trying to utilize a GtkTreeView coupled with a GtkListStore to display data, but I seem to be running into issues. I can get my application to launch fine and it shows the window and dialog correctly, but I cannot figure out how to add rows of data to the List Store programmatically and have them appear in the Tree View most tutorials I find seem to prefer to make the rows in Glade, or to design the whole interface through the code. With the code as it is I receive no errors when running the program, but I cannot see anything being added in GtkTreeView. I dont see any blank rows being added either.p  pBy writing some code to forcibly generate an error, I can see that the signal for codepostingButtoncode is being connected I think so that should be fine. Im just missing something in my actual implementation of GtkTreeView. If anyone can help me out, Id greatly appreciate itp  pEdit The GtkEntries that are present will be implemented later Im just trying to get data to show up at all.p  pC Codep  precode Id give objects better names normally, no worries   Just goofing around for now.  include ltgtk3.0gtkgtk.hgt  Needed for interface. include ltgtk3.0gdkgdk.hgt include ltglib2.0glibobject.hgt  void onmainWindowdestroyGObject object, gpointer userdata      gtkmainquit   void onstupidButtonclickedGtkButton button, gpointer userdata      gtkdialogrunGTKDIALOGuserdata   void onpostingButtonclickedGtkButton button, gpointer userdata      GtkListStore liststore1     GtkWidget treeview1  Ive tried defining this as a GtkTreeView as well.

Negative 88 pI am seeing some very high nonmapped virtual memory usage for MongoDB. I can see the large amount of virtual memory in codetopcode and codepmapcode tells me most of it is not allocated to files. Furthermore codeMMScode confirms this by showing a large amount of nonmapped virtual memory.p  pThe codeMMScode description of the graph states the following about nonmapped virtual memoryp  blockquote   pIf this number is very high multiple gigabytes, it indicates that excessive memory is being used by other aspects than the memory mapping of files  that would be badsuboptimal. The most common case of usage of a high amount of memory for nonmapped is that there are very many connections to the database. Each connection has a thread stack and the memory for those stacks can add up to a considerable amount. Keeping this statistic reasonably low is important as the memory used here is unavailable for caching.p blockquote  pSo now I am wondering whether or not the amount I am seeing here is unreasonable and if it is actually a problem, or if its fine. The amounts can be seen in the image, but I will also explain them in text here, just in case.p  pMy db size is about 12.5GB. Resident memory usage is at 11GB, mapped at 18GB and virtual at a whopping 118GB. The amount of connections to the db is about 50 moving between 40 and 60, so that doesnt seem like the cause.p  pIt might be worth noting that I see a lot of entries similar to this in codepmapcode outputp  precode0000013f9dfff000 521296K     [ anon ] 000001439e400000   1024K     [ anon ] 000001439e500000   1024K rw    [ anon ] 000001439e600000   2048K     [ anon ] 000001537ce33000    820K     [ anon ] 000001537cf00000     20K rw    [ anon ] 000001537cf05000      4K     [ anon ] 000001537cf06000    996K rwx    [ anon ] 000001537cfff000      4K     [ anon ] 000001537d000000     20K rw    [ anon ] 000001537d005000      4K     [ anon ] 000001537d006000    996K rwx    [ anon ] codepre  pEspecially the first entry of approximately .5GB seems excessive. I see it coming back very often, 159 times according to some grepping. So that would explain most of the amount that I am seeing. I dont know where these entries are coming from though.p  pI am using MongoDB v2.4.1 on CentOS 6.4 64 bits.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgvf2t.png altMMS screenshotp

Negative 88 pHave landed into a scenario again. The summary is as follows I have a usercontrol which is basically a mix up of a textbox,imagebuttons,checkboxlist incorporated together to look like a singleselect dropdown with checkboxes..works pretty fine. One of the images inside the usercontrol opens up an aspx page as a popup.have few functionalities there viz saving values to database and stuffs. On the OK button click of the popup page, I should be able to save the values to the DB as well as populate the usercontrolwhich acts as a dropdown with the value which I have saved to the DB. Here the problem arises, when trying to bind the checkboxlistpresent in the usercontrol to the values from the DB, I get the error that the checkboxlist object is null and has not been created. I feel that on the OK button click, the usercontrol has to refresh and hence the checkboxlist will be active.p  pPFB the relevant codes Usercontrol.ascxp  precodelt Control LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindSingleSelectCustomDropDown.ascx.cs InheritsMS.IT.Informa.UI.UserControls.SingleSelectCustomDropDown gt  ltaspPanel IDpanel runatservergt ltdiv idFirstDivgt lttablegt lttrgt lttd alignrightgt ltaspTextBox IDtxtSelect runatserver ReadOnlytruegtltaspTextBoxgt lttdgt lttdgt ltaspImage IDimgShow ImageUrl..ImagesDDGlyph.png onmouseoverthis.src..ImagesDDGlyphHOVER.png onmouseoutthis.src..ImagesDDGlyph.png runatserver gt lttdgt lttrgt lttrgt lttd colspan2gt ltdiv idSecondDiv styledisplaynonegt ltaspCheckBoxList IDchkBoxList runatservergt ltaspListItem Value0 TextStandard SelectedTruegtltaspListItemgt ltaspCheckBoxListgt ltdivgt ltdiv idThirdDiv styledisplaynonegt ltaspImageButton IDbtnNew runatserver Height20px ImageUrlImagesnew.png Width20px OnClientClickShowPopup gt ltaspImageButton IDbtnEdit runatserver Height20px ImageUrlImagesedit.png Width20px gt ltaspImageButton IDbtnDefault runatserver Height20px ImageUrlImagesdefault.png Width20px gt ltaspImageButton IDbtnDelete runatserver Height20px ImageUrlImagesdelete.png Width20px gt ltdivgt lttdgt lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltaspPanelgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt Displays the divs containing checkboxlist and images function ShowList      document.getElementByIdSecondDiv.style.display  block     document.getElementByIdThirdDiv.style.display  block  Hides the divs containing checkboxlist and images function HideList      document.getElementByIdSecondDiv.style.display  none     document.getElementByIdThirdDiv.style.display  none  Displays the selected item from the checkboxlist into the textbox placed in the Custom Control function DisplaySelectedItemsender, txtBoxID       var x  document.getElementByIdsender.id     var chkBoxPrefix  sender.id       var selectedText     for i  0 i lt x.rows.length i      ifdocument.getElementByIdchkBoxPrefixi.checked              selectedText  document.getElementByIdchkBoxPrefixi.parentNode.innerText               document.getElementByIdtxtBoxID.id.value  selectedText  Ensures that only one item is selected from the checkboxlist function SelectOnlyOneCheckBoxe       if e e  window.event     var sender  e.target  e.srcElement     if sender.nodeName  INPUT          return          var checker  sender     var chkBox  document.getElementByIdlt chkBoxList.ClientID gt     var chks  chkBox.getElementsByTagNameINPUT     for i  0 i lt chks.length i          if chks[i]  checker             chks[i].checked  false       function ShowPopup      window.openViewColumnOptions.aspx, ViewColumnOptions, height300,width600,left300,top150  ltscriptgt codepre  pThe codebehind for the usercontrol as belowp  precodepublic partial class SingleSelectCustomDropDown  System.Web.UI.UserControl              protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e                  if IsPostBack                      chkBoxList.Attributes.Addonclick, SelectOnlyOneCheckBoxeventDisplaySelectedItemthis,  txtSelect.ClientID  HideList             txtSelect.Attributes.Addonclick, ShowList             imgShow.Attributes.Addonclick, ShowList                   public void PopulateOtherViews              SaveReportViewFilterltReportFilterBasegt newObj  new SaveReportViewFilterltReportFilterBasegt         ViewColumnOptions vwobj  new ViewColumnOptions         newObj.UserName  vwobj.Page.User.Identity.Name         SaveReportViewltReportFilterBasegt obj2  new SaveReportViewltReportFilterBasegt         DataTable dt  obj2.GetSaveReportViewFromDataBasenewObj         chkBoxList.DataSource  dtchkBoxList becomes null here..we have ample data in the datatable though         chkBoxList.DataTextField  dt.Columns[0].ToString         chkBoxList.DataValueField  dt.Columns[0].ToString         chkBoxList.DataBind       codepre  pThe function PopulateOtherViews is called on the button click of the aspx page.

Negative 88 pmy Android App is highly depending on an Internet connection.p  pIts an App for an Internetradio.

For reference, this VB6 app is not a commerciallydistributed product, just an internallyused testing tool within my own department at work.  It takes flatfile fixed width data, parses it, then generates the SQL code to insert it to the DB.p

Negative 88 pI noticed this weird effect where memory is not registered as allocated by the Windows Task Manager until it is touched instead of when it is codemalloccodeed or codenewcodeed. The effect occurs in both the codedebugcode and optimized codereleasecode builds.p  pThe following is a structural example, although in my code the allocation and utilization occurs on different threads so I dont think its the optimizer, although I am not sure how to check.p  precodefor int i  0 i lt 1000i  buffer[i]mallocbuffersize  sleep100060 for int i0ilt1000i  memsetbuffer[i],0,buffersizeOnly shows up the in the resource manager here  codepre  pMy question is how does Windows know I have used the memory Is it monitoring memory for first usage or is it some compile time optimization. p  pMy curiosity is motivated by a realtime acquisition I am writing that requires me to touch the memory twice  once when allocating and once when actually filling it with data. Thus pressing a button aquire requires me to write 64 gigabytes of ram at once, as opposed to over time, adding a fairly real amount of latency. If I codemalloccode as I go this adds too much latency.p  peditp  pI also disabled the Windows pagefile...p

Negative 88 pi have something being done when a radio is checked, however, now i want to make the same thing happen on page load, hopefully without duplicating the bulk of the code.p  pthe reason im adding it for page load is because im creating an editupdate page.  the first page is for saving form data to mysql database, and second page grabs values from database and displays the form as it was saved and a person can make changes and save it back to the database.p  pso i have this for the click.  its more than this for the other radio values, but dont want to paste too much.  this is just examplep  precodeinput[nametypeofmailerradio].clickfunction      ifthis.value  Postcards          typeofpostcardmaileroptions.showfast          else          typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast          more ifelses for more radio values here  codepre  pso i did a test and put all of this into the page codep  precodeinput[nametypeofmailerradio]checked.valfunction  ifthis.value  Postcards          typeofpostcardmaileroptions.showfast          else          typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast          more ifelses for more radio values here  codepre  pfirst, thats what i meant by duplicating the bulk of code, and second it didnt really work.  it worked for page load, but the section of code for clicking didnt want to work anymore.p  pwhat i want to do is an or or something.  something like this, but dont know how to go about itp  precodeinput[nametypeofmailerradio].clickfunction  input[nametypeofmailerradio]checked.valfunction      ifthis.value  Postcards          typeofpostcardmaileroptions.showfast          else          typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast          more ifelses for more radio values here  codepre  pby the way, what the proposed solution i wrote doesnt work at all.  doesnt work on load and doesnt work when clicking.p  pdoesnt workp  precodeinput[nametypeofmailerradio],input[nametypeofmailerradio]checked.clickfunction  ifthis.value  Postcards      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.showfast  else      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast  more ifelses for more radio values here  codepre  pdoesnt workp  precodeinput[nametypeofmailerradio],input[nametypeofmailerradio]checked.valfunction  ifthis.value  Postcards      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.showfast  else      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast  more ifelses for more radio values here  codepre  pthis is what i did to make it work...p  precodedocument.readyfunction    function typeOfMailer   iftypeofmailerradio1.ischecked         typeofpostcardmaileroptions.showfast     snapapartoption.hidefast     typeofspecialtymaileroptions.hidefast     typeofmaileroptions.hidefast   else iftypeofmailerradio2.ischecked      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast     snapapartoption.showfast     typeofspecialtymaileroptions.hidefast     typeofmaileroptions.hidefast   else iftypeofmailerradio3.ischecked      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast     snapapartoption.hidefast     typeofspecialtymaileroptions.showfast     typeofmaileroptions.hidefast   else      typeofpostcardmaileroptions.hidefast     snapapartoption.hidefast     typeofspecialtymaileroptions.hidefast     typeofmaileroptions.showfast     input[nametypeofmailerradio].clickfunction  typeOfMailer   typeOfMailer  codepre

I want to implement program that checks if contents of 1 .txt file has changed.p  pThere is this FILENOTIFYCHANGESIZE filter of ReadDirectoryChangesW API would do the trick Even then, how do I hook it to 1 file rather than entire directoryp  pstrongIs there any sample code reference for this.. I have worked on .NET but am very new to VB6...strongp
Negative 88 pI have a project where I need to update multiple areas of a texture and synchronise those areas into openGL every frame. Im using openGL ES 2.0 with a project in xcode5 for iDevices.p  pTo sync those texture changes I use glTexSubImage2D, potentially calling this function several hundred times per frame for small areas of the bound texture. This works fast enough for my needs when testing on an iPhone4 running ios6.p  pWhen I test it on my iPad Mini Retina, running ios7, it stalls significantly. The stalls show up in machmsgtrap from three functions called under glTexSubImage2D.p  pUnfortunately I cant post images of the profile due to a lack of reputation points, but the three functions are called from agxuBlitRender, taking up a combined 86.1 of the CPU agxuCreateRenderTarget 38.2 SubmitPackets 25.5 agxuReleaseAllRenderTargets 16.2p  pI appreciate machmsgtrap just means the thread is spinning whilst waiting, but I cannot determine what its waiting for, from the profiler.p  pI was initially wondering whether it might be rebuilding mipmaps or some other process that ios7 forces. Ive not got mipmaps turned on, although according to the options in gl.h, I might not have much of a choice all the TextureMinFilters are mipmap orientated, even though I set it to GLNEAREST, it might be defaulting to GLNEARESTMIPMAPNEAREST if it considers GLNEAREST invalid. The fact that the iPhone4 version uses the exact same code might not be the deciding factor if it deals with mipmapping under the hood.p  pWhilst Ive tried just copying the entire texture once per frame, this becomes significantly slower with larger texture sizes, when the function twiddle32x3232, deep in the heart of openGL, eats a large portion of the CPU per frame.p  pAny help gratefully received.p

Negative 88 pIm playing with codepsycopg2code for the first time today, and Im trying to understand how passwords work...

Clearly only one of those lines should work regardless of what the password actually is. As expected, I do get an error if I try a codeuseramos123code, since that user doesnt exist. If it matters, my PostgreSQL was installed with codePostgres.appcode.p

My issue is related to performance, as my app may execute DB operations with some frequency, causing it to become slow after migrating to SQLCipher.p  pFor my DatabaseHelper methods, I believe Im following the standard approach, e.g.p  precode   Getting all MyObjects   public ListltMyObjectgt getMyObjects       ListltMyObjectgt objects  new ArrayListltMyObjectgt      String selectQuery  SELECT  FROM   TABLENAME     Log.vLOG, selectQuery       Open     SQLiteDatabase db  this.getReadableDatabase...the password...

The queries seem to work fast and I dont think I need to worry about them.p  pIf I drill down the calls, following the one with the longest duration every time, I end up withp  pcodeSQLiteDatabase.OpenOrCreateDatabasecode  codeSqLiteDatabase.openDatabasecode  codeSQLiteDatabase.openDatabasecode  codeSQLiteDatabase.setLocalecodep  pSo the codeSQLiteDatabase.setLocalejava.util.Localecode seems to be the culprit, as it is taking 4 seconds everytime getReadableDatabase is called. Ive looked into the source for SQLiteDatabase and it just locks the DB, calls codenativesetLocalelocale.toString, mFlagscode the 4 sec. overhead takes place here and unlocks the DB.p  pAny idea on why this happensp

It all works beautifully. p  pExcept, when you try and do a MASS update of the Address table.p  pFor examplep  precodeaddresses.update  country Australia ,  street Something else ,  multi true   codepre  pWhen this is done, I also run a query for each parent table in this case, codepeoplecode this wayp  precodepeople.update  children.country Australia,  children.addresses..street Something else ,  multi true   codepre  pNote that the new query is automatically worked out.p  pHowever, because of bug a hrefhttpsjira.mongodb.orgbrowseSERVER1243 relnofollowhttpsjira.mongodb.orgbrowseSERVER1243a, I am basically screwed. p  pNote that inserting is always a single operation that implies a simple push no problems there, and deleting is an operation that requires a pull on children pull accepts a filter to work on the array. So, no problems there too. The only problem is only with massupdate.p  pNowp  ul lipI cannot load the full document and change all of the entries by hand for several reasons 1 performance I would need to run an update on every single record matching, and it could be 1 million 2 AND its actually impossible because I wouldnt have a way to rerun the query which might involve regexps etc. on the loaded documentpli lipI cannot repeat the update operation till I get ZERO updates they have all been changed because if the change is such that will emalsoem match, it will do it forever if you change perth to perth2, and match for anything beginning with p.pli ul  pBut, I really need this feature and I just cannot figure out how to do it.p  pDo you guys have some ideas, other than beg the MongoDB guys to fix this issue, which is yet another weakness in Mongos array updatingp

Negative 88 pWere having some issues with getting the Reply function to work for comments in our WordPress site. Submitting comments in general works fine, but even though the URL Im redirected to from the Reply button looks correct, it just posts it as a normal comment, and the title above the comment section is just the regular title, not the expected Leave a Reply to.... Its a custom theme, but its set up to support this and WordPress itself is configured to allow threaded comments down to the default 5 levels.p  pHeres the site in question a hrefhttpantagonist.no relnofollowhttpantagonist.noap  pWhats strange about this is that it only happens in the live environment. I have a testing environment set up locally, where WordPress is configured with the exact same configuration and version of our template. The Reply function works perfectly there, with the same URL structure and parameters, and Im unable to reproduce whats going on in the live environment.p  pThe only differences are the hosting environments my local testing environment runs on Apache 2.2 on OS X 10.9, while the live environment runs on IIS 6 on Windows Server 2008 R2. Both are running PHP 5.5.8. Could this be due to the URL rewriting for permalinks WordPress does this automatically on Apache, but on IIS in the live environment we used a plugin called ISAPIRewrite 3 a hrefhttpwww.helicontech.comisapirewrite relnofollowhttpwww.helicontech.comisapirewritea to support the URL rewriting, with the following rulesp  precodeRewriteBase  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.phpp1 [NC,L] codepre  pIt seems to work fine for anything else than comment replies.p  pAny ideas for things we could check for or tryp

Negative 88 pIm trying to store arrays or vectors of data in a SQLite database but Im having problems trying to find a decent way to do so. I found some other post on StackOverflow, that I cant seem to find anymore, which mentioned storing the data in a table like the followingp  precodeCREATE TABLE arrayofpoints      id integer NOT NULL,     position integer NOT NULL,     x integer NOT NULL,     y integer NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY id, position  codepre  pSo to store all the data for a single array you would insert each item under the same ID and just increment the position. So for example to insert an array with three values it would be something likep  precodeINSERT INTO arrayofpoints VALUES 0, 0, 1, 1 INSERT INTO arrayofpoints VALUES 0, 1, 2, 2 INSERT INTO arrayofpoints VALUES 0, 2, 3, 3 codepre  pAnd then to retrieve the values you would select everything with the same ID and order by the positionp  precodeSELECT x,y FROM arrayofpoints WHERE id  0 ORDER BY position codepre  pThis is all great and works wonderfully, but Im now running into a problem where I dont know how to reference an array in a different table. For example I want to do something like the followingp  precodeCREATE TABLE foo      id integer NOT NULL,     arrayid integer NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY id,     FOREIGN KEY arrayid REFERENCES arrayofpoints id  codepre  pThis will create the table just fine but once you try to execute a query on it the foreign key constraint throws an error since it must reference both the codeidcode and codepositioncode of the codearrayofpointscode table since they are part of a composite primary key.p  pThe only solution I currently have is to just remove the foreign key from the codefoocode table, but that is not a good solution since it means it can now hold any value even if it doesnt actually map to an array in the codearrayofpointscode table.p  pIs there any way to work around this problem Or maybe theres some other way to store the data so that this is possiblep  pJust as an FYI, please do not suggest I store the data in some sort of commasemicolonwhatever delimited list because that is an even worse option that I am not going to consider. It is also not possible to do with some of the more complex objects that are going to be stored in the database.p

Negative 88 pI want to ask if there is any possibility how to develop app for jailbroken Iphone without using a mac, in a way that Id programmed application in Windows or Ubuntu and would compile a program on my jailbroken iPhone.

I would especially like some good environment for Objective C,because I know that it is the ability to program the application in Java and then import it, but I think that in the future it would be a bad habit  I was looking for lot of simmilar questions but no one took into consideration the possibility of compilation on the phone.... but if Im stupid, please navigate me to the right place and close this issue.

Negative 88 pI have a AngularJS app implemented in a Chrome Extension. Its using Content Scripts to inject itself into the users pages as they navigate. In it theres an interval that calls back to our servers every N seconds as a polling mechanism to check for new data to return to the client. p  precodemyInterval  intervalfunction       calls back to server , 30000  scope.ondestroy, function      if angular.isDefinedmyInterval          interval.cancelmyInterval         myInterval  undefined       codepre  pI noticed the traffic on our servers was increasing so I investigated and found that the query triggered by this interval is slamming our servers at a way higher rate than our users could possibly be triggering under expected conditions. For example, at a rate of 200 requests per minute from the same user. p  pIt seems the interval is staying alive even after navigating to a new page, closing the tab, etc. Ive come to understand that listening for destroy and canceling the interval takes care of routing changes within the app, but how do I make sure the interval is cancelled when a user undergoes normal browsing activity since a new interval is about to be created when the next page is loadedp
Negative 88 pThanks for the help in advance. Im working on an practice assigment using Phonegap and Javascript. Long story short I need to use Parse.com to store information about some Lego minifigures. The problem Im having right now is due mostly to my inexperience in Javascript.p  pIm working on letting the user add tags to the figures. The user enters them, separated by comma, and I then split the string. Thats working OK.p  pNow, I need to add the tags that dont exist yet to my database. For this, I search for any tags with that description using query.find and then, if it exists, I dont create it, I just modify the relationship. If it doesnt exist, I create it and then modify the relationship.p  pMy problem is I cant seem to be able to access the tag description the string from within the success callback of query.find.

Print a codegtcode in front of user input before using stdcin. I have simple code in place that prints the codegtcode, flushes cout and then calls codegetlinecode. It works when just running the program normally. But sadly, GDB refuses to flush the stream when there isnt a newline, so it doesnt print the codegtcode, ignores the first character of the user input and then emdoesem prints the codegtcode, immediately followed by the error message that my program sends because of the mutilated input string.p  pIn Windows, Ive solved it by making a .gdbinit file with a hrefhttpvisualgdb.comgdbreferencecommandssetnewconsole relnofollowcodeset newconsole oncodea. This causes GDB to use a Windows console in stead of its own and that works as intended.p

Negative 88 pIm using jQuery validation in order to sort banners on a website.p  pI have three types of bannersp  ul liDefault Banner set by the company, existing rule cannot be removed but can be sortedli liSelectable Banner selectable banner form a list of manyli liSpecial Banner special banner, set by the company difference between this and default is that they can be removed from the carousel li ul  pThe banners carousel has a few rules no more than 7 banners are allowed into the carousel and four of these can be custom, with the four of these being selectablebanners. Ive got the logic for this as followsp  precode  no more than 7 banners allowed     sortable1.sortable     connectWith .connectedSortable,     receive This event is triggered when a connected sortable list has received an item from another list.     receive functionevent, ui           so if gt 7         if this.children.length gt 7              ui.sender will cancel the change.

Negative 88 pIm working on a BizTalk application.p  pI have setup my vocabularies and have started writing the rules in the rule composer.p  pAfter evaluating a rule, I have made a function called AddValidationError which writes the validation error into the XML document being validated.  The AddValidationError method is called from the Action section of the rule.p  pI want to pass the node that is being evaluated to the AddValidationError method to that I can determine the XPath to that node and include it as part of the error message.p  pI thought I can have a parameter of type TTypedXmlDocument but this doesnt allow me to pass nodes which are defined as anything other than TTypedXmlDocument, such as string, int, datetime, etc.  I have noticed that the rule engine has a method called Exists which will accept any type of node and resolves it to XPath, which is what I want.p  pI dont want to have to copy the XPath text into the AddValidationError method as this seems messy and also any BA should be able to create new rules by simply dragging and dropping nodes and methods onscreen, i.e, they shouldnt have to know that you need to copy the XPath to the node into the AddValidationError method for it to work.p  pI hope this makes sense.p  pSo coming back to the Exists predicate method, i can pass it any node and it appears to work out the XPath automatically, how can i get this functionality or better yet, how can I pass a node of type other than TTypedXmlDocument to a method and then determine the XPath to the node passed inp  pI have thought about having two definitions for each node, one that represents the value, string, int, datetime, etc and another for the same node but of the TTypedXmlDocument.  Although this does work it also smells a bit so would like something better.p

Negative 88 pI am using ChromeVox for accessibility testing in my project. I am facing an issue while trying to provide aria tags for graphs. I read that we can use ariadescribedby to describe graphs. But ChromeVox does not read the description while navigating forward from one control to the graph.

Negative 88 pIn my Chrome extension I am injecting the emcontent scriptem into all codeIFRAMEscode inside a page. Heres a part of the codemanifest.jsoncode filep  precodecontentscripts [              runat documentend,         allframes  true,         matchaboutblank true,         matches [http, https],         js [content.js]      ], codepre  pSo a single web page having multiple codeIFRAMEscode will end up running that many copies of my injected codecontent.jscode.p  pThe logic inside codecontent.jscode collects data from each codeIFRAMEcode its injected into, or from the maintop page, and sends it back to the embackground scriptem using codechrome.runtime.sendMessagecode. The embackground scriptem in turn needs to store the data in the global variable, that is later used in the extension itself.p  pThe issue Im facing is that the app needs to distinguish between the data received from multiple codeIFRAMEscode, since my data collection method can be called repeatedly upon users interaction with the page, and thus I cannot simply dump the data received by the embackground scriptem into an array. Instead I need to use a codedictionarycodetype data storage.p  pI can tell if the data is coming from an codeIFRAMEcode or from the top page by running the followingp  precodeFrom the content.js var isIframe  window  window.top codepre  pand my thinking was that if I collect page URLs of each codeIFRAMEcode then I should be able to use it as a unique key to store the data under in my dictionarytype global variablep  precodeAgain from content.js var strUniqueIFrameURL  document.URL codepre  pWell, that is not going to work, because two or more codeIFRAMEscode can have the same URLs.p  pSo thus my original question  how to tell codeIFRAMEscode on the page apart Is there some unique ID or somethign that Chrome assigns to themp

Negative 88 pBackground Im working on an MVC framework for some practice, and want to make sure everything is 100 unit tested.p  pThe setup currently is to have an instance of the application class codeExAppcode. The main script asks a DispatcherRouter for a controller name. This controller name is the name of a class implementing codeExControllercode. The result is returned as an instance of codeExDispatchResultcode. This result is passed to the codeExAppcode instance using an codeinvokeControllerdispatchResultcode function.p  pAnd this is where magic happens. The listing below is an excerptp  precodecontrollerName  dispatchResultgtgetControllerName ... checks for validaty of class name ... controller  new controllerName controllergtpreparethis codepre  pIm using PHPUnit to do my unit testing, and am able to mock the dispatch result, correctly check that validating the class name of the controller works. The problem is how to check if prepare is called.p  pId like to do something similar top  precodemockController  thisgtgetMockBuilderExController   gtsetMockClassNameInvokeCorrectController   gtgetMock mockControllergtexpectsthisgtoncegtmethodprepare codepre  pHowever since a new instance of codeInvokeCorrectControllercode is created upon calling codeinvokeControllercode, it will not be this mock and thus the codeexpectscode call is completely irrelevant.p  pI could make the codeExDispatchResultcode class responsible for returning a controller and testing that, but before returning an instance I will need to verify the correctness of the class name and in my opinion that responsibility should be with the codeExAppcode class and not the dumb shell codeExDispatchResultcode class.p  pIs there something I am missing in the PHPUnit framework that I could use to test the code here, or some useful pattern that could work in my instance I feel passing around controller names scales way better than passing around instances of controllers from the start, requiring the initialization of every possible controller. So, I kinda want to stick to passing around names and using the codeExAppcode as a factory for the controller instance.p  pMaybe Im just overthinking part of this problem, but that happens sometimes. Its why a fresh look by a third party often works p

But this seems problematic because some of the fields need to be shared across objects e.g. the codeClientIDcode needs to know the associated codeEmployerIDcode. p  pTo further complicate things, I would like to add fields with the code[FieldNotInFile]code attribute to the class definitions because during processing, my application will query for database records that match a specific row field and populate the rows respective code[FieldNotInFile]codes e.g. get clients codeFNamecode from database based on codeSSNcode since its not in the file.p  pHow would you structure this I kind of just want to keep the whole file row as one class, but its approaching 75 fields, which seems ridiculous.

Negative 88 pAt my work I wrote a little parser for Clike expressions in one of our inhouse Perl tools. I initially chose ParseRecDescent because of its extreme ease of use and straightforward grammar syntax, but Im finding that its excessively slow which is corroborated by general opinion found on the web. Its safe to assume that the grammar of the expressions is no more complicated than that of C.p  pWhat are the fastest but still with a straightforward and uncumbersome grammar format lexxerparser modules for the use case of thousands of simple expressions Id guestimate the median length is 1 token, mean is 2 or so, and max is 30 Additionally, thanks to unsavory IT choices, it must work in Perl 5.8.8 and it and any noncore dependencies must be pure Perl.p

Negative 88 pI am working on a project that has multiple plugins, and one of the plugins needs to composite two animated images on top of one another. The problem is that one of these will be userdefined and will most likely not match up framewise to the other. p  pHow I get around this currently is by loading both images, finding the lowest common multiple of their frame count, then extracting them over and over until I hit their LCM, then recombining the extracted images into separate gif files, then compositing those two together. Here is the relevant code as far as the extending goesp  precodedef self.extendgifsone, two     imgone  MagickImageList.newone.coalesce     imgtwo  MagickImageList.newtwo.coalesce      lcm  imgone.length.lcmimgtwo.length      i  0     while i lt lcm         imgone[i  imgone.length].writetmp1i.tos.rjust4, 0.png         imgtwo[i  imgtwo.length].writetmp2i.tos.rjust4, 0.png         i  1     end      xconvert limit memory 256MiB dispose Background tmp1.png tmpextend1.gif     xconvert limit memory 256MiB dispose Background tmp2.png tmpextend2.gif      Dir[tmp.png].each  f File.delete f  end codepre  pThe problem is that this is deployed on a server with 1GB of memory, and running this code in ruby takes upwards of 500MB or more depending on how many frames or how big the user defined gif is, not including the memory that the convert process takes. Because of this, I want to move away from using rmagick and ruby and drop the process onto the external tools I have available which can limit memory usage to some degree. p  pThis brings me to my question How would I replicate this process using the imagemagick command line tools p  pEditp  pBy request, here are some example images and output. This should work for any two images though, assuming one has a transparent background.p  pBackground image 3 frames p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comC9IT9SY.gifp  pForeground image 11 framesp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comMlFOzAE.gifp  pResult foreground repeated 3 times, background repeated 11 times.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comATwiMZC.gifp

Negative 88 pI am trying to implement a twodrawer layout with the android v7 support library. I have a navigation drawer on the left Gravity.START side and a notification drawer on the right Gravity.END side. The problem is that I need the hamburger in the action bar to stay a hamburger when the notification drawer is pulled out, but stay animated and change to an arrow if the navigation drawer is pulled out. Currently it changes to an arrow when either one is pulled out. I have successfully disabled the animation by overriding codeonDrawerSlideView, floatcode and only calling to codesuper.onDrawerSlideView, floatcode if the View is the navigation drawer and doing nothing if the View is the notification drawer like thisp  precodeOverride public void onDrawerSlideView drawerView, float slideOffset       Make sure it was the navigation drawer     ifdrawerView.equalsnavigationDrawer          super.onDrawerSlidedrawerView, slideOffset          else           Do nothing       codepre  pHowever, once the notification drawer has fully opened, the icon still changes to an arrow. Any idea how to disable this changep

Negative 88 pI wanted to clarify something that I find strange in Chrome. It seems that it is quite finicky in terms of finding element properties via JQuery though I suspect its true in general of elements that are first shown.p  pWhat I mean is in various areas in my codebase, the FIRST time I switch the object from display none to display XXX and immediately query various properties such as height, scrollHeight, etc., I get a value that is off by some pixels.p  pHowever, this only happens the first time. If I then hide the element and show it again, the second time everything has been corrected. If I simply query the same property with a time delay after the first show, then everything has again been corrected.p  pThis does not happen at all in any other browser. The exact same code produces precise query calls. Is this just a particular problem with howwhen Chrome updates its element properties Im assuming its not synchronous and therefore has some lagtime.p  pEDIT Ive fixed these issues for Chrome with a hack where at page loadtime I simply show.hide all the elements that I want accurate measurements from opacity 0. I find this extremely hacky but it works.p

Negative 88 pI have a 3 axis cylinder graph in Excel which is generated from a pivot table sourced from a SQL DB table.  Currently, Excel is simply pulling strongallstrong the data from the SQL table into a pivot table to generate the datasource behind the graph.

The graph looks like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt0jCz.png altCylinder graphp  pAnd the SQL table column structure is as follows terrible schema, I knowp  ul liEntryIDli liOperatorli liDateYearli liDateMonthli liDateDayli liVarious other items irrelevant for generating the graphli ul  pSo far Ive been able to use code to pull the data needed to populate the source outside of Excel, though this generates 122 separate queriesclearly unacceptable.

Negative 88 pI made an apache module with a purpose of creating a file for every unique IP address that connects to the linux computer and updating its contents everytime.p  pI tried this module out on a simple config where linux usernames arent an issue. On my computer when the code works, and a file is created, the username and group automatically assigned to the file on creation is daemon. I assume this is because that is the default user and group name values for apache.p  pSo then I uploaded my module to a modRuid2 configuration and when the modules are loaded, the system changes the active username based on what folder is being requested.p  pSince I want the module to apply to the whole server instead of just folders of one username, I need to know what I need to add to my module so that I can read configuration in httpd via my module AND read and write data via original username before it switches over to another one which then makes all my writes a permission denied.p  pCan anyone tell me what to include in my C modulep  pI think the module suexec is responsible for changing usernames but I dont want to just ditch it for security reasons.p

Each checkbox has its own code.colxscode class, to keep things aligned and looking clean.  p  pThe problem is that when a user shrinks the viewport, some labels will move underneath the checkboxes, which looks a little messyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFJ77j.png altenter image description herep  pTo fix this problem, Ive just been making the codecolcode classes larger e.g. changing code.colxs4code to code.colxs5code or adding code.formgroupcode and code.formcontrolcode classes to create checkboxey areas, but I imagine that there might be a cleaner solution.p  ul liIs there a Bootstrappy way to keep these checkboxes aligned when the width of the label exceeds the codecolxscode containers width  li liAre there some simple CSS rules I can use to apply fixes to these form fieldsli ul  pHeres a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netoLzyLvc4 relnofollowJSFiddlea example of how my form looks right now.p

Negative 88 pHow can you create widgets from html scripts in your page Lets say I havep  precodeltscript typetexthtml idwidgetsimplegt     ltdiv classwidgetsimplegt        This is my widget and hes called  test      ltdivgt ltscriptgt ltscript typetexthtml idwidgetcomplexgt     ltdiv classwidgetcomplexgt        This is my complex widget and hes called  test      ltdivgt ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd I want to create a widget with the following scopep  precodefunction createWidgetname, class      var self  this     this.name  name     this.class  class  var widgetList  [] function createWidgetList     forvar i0 j3 iltj i         var class  i lt 2  simple  complex        widgetList.pushnew createWidgetwidget i, class      createWidgetList codepre  pThis will all be done in a controller hopefully, but Im trying to skim as much JS down as possible to make sure its obvious what Im asking for. In essence Ill have an array of widgets, each having their own properties. I can modify these properties and the html will update itself, but only for that widget, not them all. So at the start I should have three widgets on my page called test 1, test 2 and test 3, and because theyre all divs with nothing else, itll just be this text.p  precodeltdiv ngappmyAppgt    ltdiv ngcontrollermyCtrlgt        ltdiv ngrepeatw in widgetListgt            lt Somehow render the widget here gt        ltdivgt    ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNow, you may have noticed I have two different types of widget, which are defined in two script tags.

Negative 88 pI am currently writing parallel code using joblib to do some extremely CPUintensive processing on a set of data files. Ultimately, the code will be run either on one of my labs highpowered machines or on a cluster, with access to many tens or hundreds of cores. However, for a given run of the program, the list of data files to be processed will likely be only 2030.p  pRight now, Im telling codejoblib.Parallelcode to use all cores available by setting codencores  1code. However, I wonder what will happen when the iterable passed to joblib has fewer elements than there are cores on my machine Is it even to speed things up beyond this point Is it possible that this will introduce some sort of unnecessary overhead and actually slow the process down Should I add some sort of protection statement to my code, egp  precodeif joblib.cpucount lt lenlistofdatafiles     ncores  lenlistofdatafiles codepre  p...or is this total overkillp  pIm unable to test this in an environment with a lot of cores right now because I dont yet have access to the highpowered environment where this code will be run. From tests on my old Dell quadcore, testing with codencorescode set gratuitously causes a significant slowdown, but its unclear whether this is because Ive set it higher than the number of data files or because its higher than my actual number of cores.p

Negative 88 pIm stuck on an assignment where I will need to have a text field update each time a user clicks on a button.

Negative 88 pThis is a question on how to structure an SSIS package to solve a very specific problem Im new SSIS and have not found anything on the correct approach.p  pMy Problem I have a SSIS package that reads a very simple XML file. The XML Source sees the information as a single table. One of the table columns is a qualifier that affects the way a record is processed. Rather than having the processing for all of the qualifiers in a single task, Id like to have a separate task for each qualifier for modularity. I could have the task for each qualifier read, shred, and process the XML file, but reading and shredding the XML file multiple times seems like an inefficient way of doing this. Id think it would be better to have a task for an XML Source that persists the data, and then have that data used by a number of other tasks that process the data.p  pA Possible Solution From what Ive read, the correct approach is to save the data into a Raw File Destination, and then to have the various tasks use a Raw File Source. This seems too much like a global variable to me. Is there a better way I can figure out the specifics, so I dont need a detailed answer, just the best approach.p  pThanksp

Negative 88 pSo, basically all my eventstheres min. 360 of them have codeteam1 vs. team2code or code vs. team2code or codeteam1 vs. code placeholders.

Negative 88 pIm trying to access a screen in an application, which appears when I do a mousehover over a tab and click on one of the options. I used Actions method to execute this using selenium. Heres my codep  precodeelementdriver.findElementBy.idtab Actions hoverovernew Actionsdriver hoverover.moveToElementelement.moveToElementdriver.findElementBy.idmenu.click.build.perform codepre  pWhen I login to the application and directly call this tab, Im able to access this without any issue. But the problem occurs when I access this tab from a different screen in the application. p  pWhenever I access the hoverover page from a different page in the application, sometimes the page loads correctly but most of the time it fails and I recieve no such element or stale element reference error.p  pIm really not sure how it is able to access the tab without any issue sometimes and how sometimes it is throwing errors. Please guide me here and let me know if there is anything elseany additional functionsor an alternative to Actions I can do so that the mouseover click works all the time.p  pEDIT I tried using both Explicit and Implicit waits and even thread.sleep as well, but in vain. In Chromeonly in chrome when i do a manual screen refresh while it tries to access the tab, it works. But when I do the same in my code [driver.navigate.refresh], its not workingp

Negative 88 pI want to classify MRI images of a brain tumor into benign and malignant using C. I am using SIFT features and the paper I am following clustered them using kmeans before training the SVM classifier. What I dont understand is why is there a need to do that From what I know, kmeans only clusters the features it doesnt change the size of the input.p  pI have read that possible ways are BoW and histogram. strongIn the histogram approachstrong, It just counts the  of features in each cluster right I dont think that will provide the information Ill need for classifying benign and malignant tumors because they can be both small and big. strongIn BoW approachstrong, I didnt understand this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30928135howtousesiftfeaturesforbagofwordsinopencvlinka.p  pBasically, I dont know what to do with my SIFT features to use it as input for SVM.

Negative 88 pWe just updated SpringIntegration from 3. to 4.1.6 and it seems that there is a new feature on the MessageHandlers, which is triggered by the flag shouldCopyRequestHeaders, that seems to merge all headers of a splitter or recipientList component. It defaults to true. Can we set that flag to false without writing our own component It causes us a lot of distress, like mixing up ContentType and Accept headers in outboundgateways in a complete inappropiate wayp

Negative 88 pI have been reading about class templates, specialisation and inheritance, but none of the examples provided elsewhere gave me quite what I needed. So I put together this simple example to illustrate my specific requirements.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pSay I have codeclass Acode, which contains instances of codeclass Bcode. However, there are two different types of codeBcode, which I have defined in an codeenum classcode Type 1 and Type 2, so I need two separate versions of codeclass Bcode which have some members specific to that type of codeBcode. There are two possible solutionsp  ul liSolution 1 Make B a base class containing the common members and create derived classes codeclass BType1code and codeclass BType2code. So the base class holds the common members and the derived classes have their own additional members.li ul  pIssue In codeAcode, I need to specify what codeBcodes I need codeBType1code or codeBType2code, so this means that I need one base and two derived classes for A as well. This is all made worse by the fact that the hierarchy in my actual program consists of four classes, not two. So I have to make base and derived classes for all four classesp  ul liSolution 2 Templatise codeBcode. That way I have only one class codeBcode, so I templatise codeAcode as well, no need for base or derived classes, and Bobs your uncle.li ul  pIssue Types 1 and 2 have shared members but also different members, so I have to specialise the template codetemplateltgt BltType1gtcode and codetemplateltgt BltType2gtcode. But this means that I have to implement the common members in both specialisations.p  pstrongRequirementsstrongp  pThe user should be able to instantiate codeAcode with one of the two types of codeBcode by supplying strongonlystrong an codeenum classcode as a template argument. They should have access to the members of the specialised codeclass Bcode corresponding to that codeenumcode value. There should be only one class of type A visible to the user rather than codeAType1code and codeAType2code and resp. codeBType1code and codeBType2code. From my perspective, I dont want to have to implement common members of codeBcode in separate template specialisations, so I need a way to put common members into a single class, but the additional members should still reside in separate classes.p  pstrongTentative solutionstrongp  pI have come up with the following solution. My rudimentary knowledge and understanding of templates and inheritance notwithstanding, Im actually pretty happy with the result. It gives the users centralised classes codeAcode and codeBcode so they dont have to worry about the specialisations. To me as a maintainer the benefit is that I have a place to stick the common members of each class while still providing access to the additional members of the class of the corresponding type and not the other. It is fairly obvious that one concern is object size, which is why I need only those members which are relevant to the particular type. The solution goes against every example that I have seen so far  essentially, what should be the base class such as codeclass Bcode inherits from both derived classes codeBType1code and codeBType2code. However, because of the specific template specialisation, only one of the two classes codeBType1code and codeBType2code is instantiated depending on the template argument provided. p  pPlease let me know if any part of this is unclear, and Ill try to elaborate.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHave I overlooked any monstrous hidden caveats related to this code waiting to jump and bite me when I least expect it I dont want to spend a week refactoring my code just to find out that it brings out some awful dark side of C.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  enum class ClassBType      Type1,     Type2   templateltClassBType BTgt class BType1    templateltClassBType BTgt class BType2    templateltClassBType BTgt class AType1    templateltClassBType BTgt class AType2    templateltgt class BType1ltClassBTypeType1gt      public     int type1specificitem1  1     float type2specificitem2  1.0     stdstring dummy1  Dummy var 1     stdstring dummy2  Dummy var 2     stdstring dummy3  Dummy var 3     stdstring classBtype1  Type 1      inline int gettype1specificitem1              return type1specificitem1           inline float gettype1specificitem2              return type2specificitem2           inline stdstring getdummy1              return dummy1           inline stdstring getdummy2              return dummy2           inline stdstring getdummy3              return dummy3        templateltgt class BType2ltClassBTypeType2gt      public     int type2specificitem1  2     float type2specificitem2  2.0     stdstring classBtype2  Type 2      int gettype2specificitem1              return type2specificitem1           float gettype2specificitem2              return type2specificitem2        templateltClassBType BTgt class B  public BType1ltBTgt, public BType2ltBTgt      public      Common to both Type 1 and Type 2     ClassBType dtype  BT      stdstring gettype              switch dtype                  case ClassBTypeType1             return Type 1             break          case ClassBTypeType2             return Type 2             break                 templateltgt class AType1ltClassBTypeType1gt      public     stdstring classAtype1  Type 1    templateltgt class AType2ltClassBTypeType2gt      public     stdstring classAtype2  Type 2   templateltClassBType BTgt class A  public AType1ltBTgt, public AType2ltBTgt      public     BltBTgt binst   int main      AltClassBTypeType1gt objatype1     stdcout ltlt Type of object B  ltlt objatype1.binst.gettype ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Type of object A  ltlt objatype1.classAtype1 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Dummy var 1 from object B  ltlt objatype1.binst.getdummy1 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Dummy var 2 from object B  ltlt objatype1.binst.getdummy2 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Dummy var 3 from object B  ltlt objatype1.binst.getdummy3 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Specific item 1 from B  ltlt objatype1.binst.gettype1specificitem1 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Specific item 1 from B  ltlt objatype1.binst.gettype1specificitem2 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Size of object A  ltlt sizeofobjatype1 ltlt stdendl      stdcout ltlt stdendl      AltClassBTypeType2gt objatype2     stdcout ltlt Type of object B  ltlt objatype2.binst.gettype ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Type of object A  ltlt objatype2.classAtype2 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Specific item 1 from B  ltlt objatype2.binst.gettype2specificitem1 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Specific item 1 from B  ltlt objatype2.binst.gettype2specificitem2 ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Size of object A  ltlt sizeofobjatype2 ltlt stdendl       This produces a compilation error, which is good     stdcout ltlt objatype2.binst.getdummy1 ltlt stdendl      return 0  codepre  pThis prints the followingp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeType of object B Type 1 Type of object A Type 1 Dummy var 1 from object B Dummy var 1 Dummy var 2 from object B Dummy var 2 Dummy var 3 from object B Dummy var 3 Specific item 1 from B 1 Specific item 1 from B 1 Size of object A 56  Type of object B Type 2 Type of object A Type 2 Specific item 1 from B 2 Specific item 1 from B 2 Size of object A 32 codepre

Negative 88 pCurrently, i am working on a project using WEKA. Being naive and newbie in it, there are many things which i am not familair with. In my last project I used text files as a classification using WEKA. I applied the TextDirectoryLoader convertor to convert a directory containing text files as mentioned on this URL a hrefhttpweka.wikispaces.comTextcategorizationwithWEKA relnofollowText categorization with WEKAa. Now I want to use the same stretagy for converting a directory containing source code instead of text. For example, I have a Jedit source file containing Java source code. I am trying to convert it to ARFF file so that i can apply classifiers or other functions present in WEKA on that ARFF file for data mining purposes. I have also tried a test file given on following URL a hrefhttpweka.wikispaces.comARFFfilesfromTextCollections relnofollowARFF files from Text Collectionsa. I believe i can use the same file as an example to convert source code files. However, I do not know what attributes should I define in a FastVector and What format should the data be in String or numeric. And what other sections should an ARFF file may havep  pAs in the example the authors have defined following attributesp  precodeFastVector atts  new FastVector2 atts.addElementnew Attributefilename, FastVector null atts.addElementnew Attributecontents, FastVector null codepre  pI have tried to find some examples on Google but no success.p  ol liCould anyone here suggests me any solution or alternate to solve the above said problem Example code will be highly appreciated.li liOr atleast could give me a short example which convertes a source code directory into an ARFF file.
