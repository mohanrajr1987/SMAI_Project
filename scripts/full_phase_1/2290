Positive 2290 pI am trying to get parts which have certain attributes. Each codepartcode has many attributes, and each codeattributecode has an codeattributeheadercode. So theres three tables that I need to use.p  precodeSELECT  FROM Part p  LEFT JOIN p.attributes pa JOIN pa.attributeheader pah WHERE sph.name  size AND sp.value IN 11  AND sph.name  colour AND sp.value IN Black codepre  pThis returns nothing as Ive gone wrong somewhere on the JOIN, or the lack of grouping. Im trying to select the parts which have both attributes, so using codeORcode is not a solution. I cant quite work out how to go about this  using raw MySQL I would use aliases on the join.p

Positive 2290 pWhat is the best way to handle a codeFilecode entity where you have multiple codeManyToOnecode relationships. p  pLets say I have 5 entities that has a codeOneToManycode relationship with the codeFilecode entity.p  pFile.php p  precode   ORMManyToOnetargetEntityEntity1, inversedByfiles   ORMJoinColumnnameentity1id, referencedColumnNameid, nullabletrue, onDeleteCASCADE   private entity1      ORMManyToOnetargetEntityEntity2, inversedByfiles   ORMJoinColumnnameentity2id, referencedColumnNameid, nullabletrue, onDeleteCASCADE   private entity2  and so one....  codepre  pEntity1.phpp  precode     ORMOneToManytargetEntityFile, mappedByentity1 , cascadepersist, remove, orphanRemovaltrue   protected images codepre  pThe great thing about the above is the getter and setter are set, I can persist and save to the database automatically. The relationship is set and I can load the files by just calling codeentity1gtgetFilescode.p  pWhat I dont like is every time I want to add another entity that has a codeOneToManycode with codeFilecode it creates a new column in the database so potential I could have 10 columns referencing Ids from other entities.p  pWhat I would like to achieve is saving the class of the entity in the codeclasscode field and saving the codeidcode of the record in an codeidcode field but also somehow still allowing the persist and collection saving to work.p  precodeentityid  class  2          ProjectBundleEntityEntity1 3          ProjectBundleEntityEntity2 codepre

Negative 2290 pThere are many posts on the internet about the ReadDirectoryChangesW API function missing files when there is a lot of file activity.  Most blame the speed at which the ReadDirectoryChangesW function loop is called.  This is an incorrect assumption.  The best explanation I have seen is in the following post, the comment on Monday, April 14, 2008 21527 PMp  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comforumsenUSnetfxbclthread4465cafbf4ed434f89d8c85ced6ffaa8httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comforumsenUSnetfxbclthread4465cafbf4ed434f89d8c85ced6ffaa8ap  pThe summary is that the ReadDirectoryChangesW function reports file changes as they leave the filewritebehind queue, not as they are added.  And if too many are added before being committed, you lose notice on some of them.  You can see this with your implementation, if you just write a program to generate a 1000 files in a directory real quick.  Just count how many file event notices you get and you will see there are times when you will not receive all of them.p  pThe question is, has anyone found a reliable method to use the ReadDirectoryChangesW function without having to flush the volume each time  This is not allowed if the user is not an Administrator and can also take some time to complete.p

Negative 2290 pI wanted to run something by you guys. I am starting a new project which is roughly the followingp  pImportant information I am using PHP and MySQLp  pEvery minute I get a list of todo transactions from an API from different users. p  pExample p  precodeuser1 send 1 to user2 userx send 2 to usera userw send 0.50 to user2  etc.. codepre  pLets say user1 wants to send 1 to user2. There are two posibilities, its succesful or its unsuccessful because there are insufficient funds or the user spelled the username wrong. If its unsuccesfull I send out a message to the user.p  pI am now facing several options  please bare with me through my thought process.p  pstrongOption 1strongp  pCreate a database table with transactions that need to be processed and use a cronjob that processes them every minute. The risk here is that the script could run against an error or a timeout and the other transactions would still show In Progress in the database table. So I would need a second script to check that against a timestamp.p  pstrongOption 2strongp  pCreate an API or Function which gets called for each transaction after I receive them and brings me a response. From which then I can call another API or Function to deal with that response or move on to the next transaction. However I would still have to put them in a database table since I cant risk losing them if the script stops executing. So it would work as follow put all transactions in database table  start transaction  when finished transaction delete from table  start transaction 2.p  phr p  pemBoth options are flawed because you dont know how long the list of transactions will be. If its long PHP is definitely not optimal to run for a long time  using set timeout to zero is risky. I am looking to create a solution that will scale with PHP. So I was thinking about an Option 3.emp  phr p  pstrongOption 3 Optimal solutionstrongp  pUse an API to return 10 transactions. p  pIn database set a flag to say they are sent to a script and timestamp to say when they were sentp  pPHP script retreives 10 transactions from API  handles 10 transactions.p  pOnce transaction completed  delete it from this table and copy it to completed transaction table.p  pHave a cronjob script check every 3 minutes if timesent is greater then X minutes based on an upper bound of the execution time of 10 transactions. If it is greater  set them to not sent  so they can be sent out again.p  phr p  pAs you can see I wrote down my whole thought process on this and am looking for input. Theres bound to be stuff that I missed. Also please realize that these are not real financial transactions  its just the best metafore I could use to make it clear.p  pThank you very much,p  pIcep

Negative 2290 pI wrote a custom server control that inherits from CompositeControl.  When the control is instantiated, I am dynamically adding a TextBox to its Controls collection.  I have overridden the TabIndex property so that when it is set, it applies the value to the TabIndex property of the child TextBox control.  The problem is that when the CompositeControl is rendered, it includes a span tag as the overall container, and it is setting the tabindex property on the emspanem as well as the input TextBox control.  This makes the cursor actually tab to the span, which is not what I want.  Any ideas on how to get the CompositeControl to not render the tabindex property on the spanp

This is good. However, they can also highlight the hyperlinks, and copy those. Id rather avoid that, for two reasonsp  ul liThe hyperlinks arent really part of the content, so what good are they on the clipboard or in another programli liI also expect to have other hyperlinks on the form that emarentem part of the FlowDocument, and it would be poor form for some hyperlinks to be highlightable and others not.li ul  pI like having these hyperlinks wordwrap with the paragraph, and always appear just to the right of the last line of wrapped text. As far as I know, that means they need to be part of the FlowDocument. But thats just an artifact of layout  Id be just as happy having them outside if I could get the same layout. I dont want the hyperlinks to be highlightable, any more than I would want a dialogs OK and Cancel buttons to be highlightable. Is there any way to make that happenp

Negative 2290 pThis is not a programming question. But Im sure its something that is widely known and understood in this community.p  pI have an image, x, and a much smaller image, y, and I need to convolve the two by multiplying their FFTs. But since they are not the same size I dont know how to do the frequency domain multiplication.p  pI take the twodimensional FFT of x which is an integer matrix of dimensions 4096 x 4096, which gives me the frequency domain representation, X which is a matrix of complex numbers and I think its dimension is 2048 x 2048.p  pSimilarly, I take the twodimensional FFT of y which is an integer matrix of dimension 64 x 64, which gives me the frequency domain representation, Y which is also a matrix of complex numbers and I think its dimension is 32 x 32.p  pIm using the fourn function in Numerical Recipes, so my input matrices, x and y must be collapsed into onedimensional arrays, which get replaced by their discrete Fourier transforms, X and Y. The point being that even though this is a twodimensional problem with images, I am working with onedimensional arrays.p  pIf I were trying to convolve two images of the exact same dimensions, x and y. It would all be very straightforwardp  precode X  FFTx   Y  FFTy   Z  X  Y term by term multiplication   Convolution of x and y  IFFTZ codepre  pBut if X and Y are different lengths, how do I do the multiplicationp  pOne possibility is to pad out y to have the same dimensions as x. But this seems horribly inefficient. Another possibility is to pad out Y to have the same dimensions as X. But I dont know what this means in frequency space.p  pHeres another way of asking this question If I want to convolve two images of very different dimensions using FFTs so I can do multiplication of their spectra frequency domain representation, how do I do that multiplicationp  pThanks,p  pMichael.p

I have been comparing packets but its slow and confusing.  For instance, I still havent found the key a specific policyNum that I am passing in the request packet.

Like I said, I CAN definitely call the same webservice from a Windows form by directly calling its WSE3 interface.  I know that I can get there that way. p  pIm thinking the main differences in the two programs is that one is running under a Win Form and calling WSE3 directly.  That one works.  The one that fails is basically 99 same code, published as a WCF service, so its running under IIS then a console program calls the WCFIIS service on my machine, which in turns calls the WSE3 service. p  pstrongIs there some reason IIS wouldnt use the same proxystrong p

Negative 2290 pI have a GWT application where its RPC services are handled by a GWTHandler bean so that it can integrate with Spring smoothly. The application works. No problem with that. p  pMy issue is I cant do any AOP logging with Spring. I like to log user activities from the GWT interface using AOP. I could of course do it the old way of calling an RPC service for every action that a user does and log those action, but that is not the AOP way. I have to do it in AOP because thats the clients requirements. p  pI tried using the normal Spring AOP with a generic pointcut pattern execution em.em... Its able to capture all methods except for the GWT services. So in other words, its useless.  I could of course log the backend Spring DAOs using AOP but how do I know which RPC service it came from These DAOs are used by numerous classes and methods not exclusive to GWT.p  pI tried exploring GWTENT package. It looks good. However, it works on the clients side and your classes must implement Aspectable. This means requiring changes on all client classes on my GWT application. Furthermore, you cant use private methods since to handle AOP with GWTENT, you need to create your classes via GWT.create instead of the new. Having private methods throws an error. I setup a simple application and really private methods dont work. p  pI tried searching the GWTSL package where my GWTHandler came from. They mentioned about something about AOP, but the info is very scarce. Google didnt give me any solutions or examples. p  pIve tried everything I could think of and searched Google with all my efforts but I cant find a solution to my problem.p  pAll I want to do is log methods from my GWT services via AOP. Lets say a client goes to the Report tab. Then he click on Delete button record. I want to log that activity via AOP. p  pIm using GWT with SmartGWT and SpringHibernate stack. p

Negative 2290 pIve got a multithreaded app that manipulates inmemory data no database or network access. I tried this on 2 machines, one machine is Xeon dual quad core CPU, the other is twin dialcores. 5 threads are spawned.p  pThen this multithreaded process starts it runs very quickly and the CPU usage is at 60 for 5 cores, the physical memory is 50 of the RAM capacity. Info from task manager. After its about 13 of the way through it starts to slow down and the CPU utilisation drops to just below 20. By the time it gets to 23s of the way its so slow that it takes 1 day to complete the last third while it takes half an hour to do the first 13.p  pThe process creates many SortedLists and Lists, so I am starting to suspect that the Garbage Collector cant cope, although the Task Manager memory usage is not so bad...

Since this needs to become a server which hands out file descriptors to multiple processes, Id still like to be able to use select.p  pIs there anything I can do to make this work, or does anyone know of alternative solutionsp  pPlatform is Ubuntu 10.4.p  pThis is the code that initializes the structuresp  precode  struct cmsghdrfd  public cmsghdr    int fd   int sendfdint sock, int fd    struct msghdr hdr   struct iovec data   struct cmsghdrfd msgdata    char dummy     data.iovbase  dummy   data.iovlen  sizeofdummy    hdr.msgname  NULL   hdr.msgnamelen  0   hdr.msgiov  data   hdr.msgiovlen  1   hdr.msgflags  0    hdr.msgcontrol  msgdata   hdr.msgcontrollen  sizeofmsgdata    struct cmsghdr cmsg  CMSGFIRSTHDRhdr   cmsgcmsglen    hdr.msgcontrollen   cmsgcmsglevel  SOLSOCKET   cmsgcmsgtype   SCMRIGHTS    intCMSGDATAcmsg  fd    int n  sendmsgsock, hdr, 0    ifn  1     printfsendmsg failed s socket fd  dn, strerrorerrno, sock    return n  codepre  pAgain, this works, as long as I dont call select first to check whether the socket is ready for writing.p

Negative 2290 pI am trying to figure out the best method to relate country, region and town tables.p  pOn my website I want the user to be able to just enter a town. Then optionally country and region, both of which will be required to be entered or not at all.p  pCurrently my tables are as suchp  blockquote   ptblgtUser has townID FKp      ptblgttown has idPK townName regionIDFK DEFAULT NULLp      ptblgtregion has idPK regionName countryIDFK NOT NULLp      ptblgtcountry has idPK countryNamep blockquote  pI thought to possibly further spit the user to town relation top  blockquote   ptblgtUser has locationID FKbr   tblgtlocation has id PK townIDFK regionIDFK countryIDFKp blockquote  pBut I think that is unnecessary and just further complicates the issuep  pThe country database is already populated. I intend to build up my own references of town  region  country relations as entered by users. So if a user enters a town with no region and country then it is entered into tbltown without a regionID if there isnt already a town with the same name without a region ID. This is same for a town where a region and country ID has been entered by the user. Only I check that there isnt already a town  region  country relation that already exists before entering. Later on in the development of the site I will be providing Ajax suggestions for countryregion based upon the town entered by a user.p  pSo to the questionsp  pI can envisage pitfalls with this such as duplicate data or data possibly being overwritten. Is there a better way to construct the tables to fit in with my desired methodsp  pThis might get answered by the prior question but is there anything I can do to reduce the PHP processing of the tables. Obviously Id prefer to just insert with one PHP statement but I think there are too many caveats to do it at once.p  pAlso as the users town entry may be null and may or may not contain a foreign key reference to a region how is it best to create a View that takes that into considerationp  pAs it will be hosted I would rather not be using MySQL functions.p  pPlease let me know if you need any clarification.

Negative 2290 pI need to develop an iPad application which should manage the two orientation mode landscape and portrait. According the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosfeaturedarticlesViewControllerPGforiPhoneOSBasicViewControllersBasicViewControllers.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007457CH101SW1 relnofollowofficial Apple iOS documentationa, there are 2 ways to proceed.p  pThe first one consists in adjusting views element when the rotation event is received. The main advantage is that we had only one ViewController The second one consists in displaying a specific ViewController for each orientation. Therefore, we have 2 ViewControllers.p  pThe second approach seems to be nice, but Iam afraid by the numbers of ViewController that will be needed. Whats more, the data synchronisation logic in the ViewControllers will have to be duplicated or isolated from the ViewController to be used in both orientation.p  pThe application I need to develop will contain many full custom elements and many ViewControllers.p  pIf anyone has advices or experience feedback, it would be really appreciated p  pThanks for reading p

Negative 2290 pI inherited a project that uses JJTree from a hrefhttpjavacc.dev.java.net relnofollowJavaCCa to implement a simple language parser. Since the code was over 5 years old, I decided to update all dependencies, including JavaCC, to the latest release before I do any actual development.p  pTherefore, I deleted all the files generated by JJTreeJavaCC and used the latest version 5.0 to rebuild them. The resulting files, however, seem to miss fields and methods that were previously present and the code does not compile any more.p  pI assumed that something changed in JavaCC that requires me to update the grammar file, so I tried out the codeInterprettercode example from the current JavaCC distribution, with the same results missing class fields that do not allow the code to compile.p  pFor example, here is a definition from codeSPL.jjtcode of the codeInterprettercode examplep  precodevoid Id      Token t      t  ltIDENTIFIERgt   jjtThis.name  t.image   codepre  pThe folder for this example contains an codeASTId.javacode file which originally had this contentp  precodepublic class ASTId extends SimpleNode    String name    public ASTIdint id      superid       public ASTIdSPLParser p, int id      superp, id       public void interpret         stack[top]  symtab.getname     codepre  pAfter I regenerated the codeAST.javacode files, the content changedp  precodepublic class ASTId extends SimpleNode    public ASTIdint id      superid       public ASTIdSPLParser p, int id      superp, id     codepre  pThere is ema lotem missing here and as a result the codeSPLParser.javacode generated file does not compile because it uses fields that are not defined in the corresponding classes.p  pWhat am I missing Is there a JJTree or JavaCC option that I have to use Perhaps a modification to make in the grammar file Or, as I dont really know if the original files have been edited, am I supposed to directly modify the generated files and add the missing bits manuallyp  pI have no experience with JavaCC, so I would appreciate any hints to resolve this issue.p

Negative 2290 pI have been wondering about this one for quite some time, but I cannot seem to find a definitive answer. Whenever I convert an integer to a string using the codeToStringcode method, and I run a code analysis, I get the following warning p  blockquote   pCA1305 Microsoft.Globalization  Because the   behavior of int.ToString could   vary based on the current users   locale settings, replace this call in   Class.Method with a call to   int.ToStringIFormatProvider.   If the result of int.ToString   IFormatProvider will be displayed to   the user, specify   CultureInfo.CurrentCulture as the   IFormatProvider parameter.   Otherwise, if the result will be   stored and accessed by software, such   as when it is persisted to disk or to   a database, specify   CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.p blockquote  pThis is the very wellknown generic CA1305 warning, which gets shown whenever you make a call to a method that has an overload that accepts an codeIFormatProvidercode parameter. While this is a very rightly warning in almost all cases, I cant think of anything that could go wrong when calling the default codeToStringcode strongwithout any format or formatproviderstrong on an integer. So please, if anyone knows of anything that could go wrong, enlighten me. Im guessing there must be a good reason for the codeIFormatProvidercode overload.p  pBy the way, I strongdostrong always make the call using the codeIFormatProvidercode overload, because it also seems to have a performance benefit. If anyone has any insightful comments on this, feel free to share them as well.p

Negative 2290 pI am making my own Lisplike interpreted language, and I want to do tail call optimization. I want to free my interpreter from the C stack so I can manage my own jumps from function to function and my own stack magic to achieve TCO. I really dont mean stackless per se, just the fact that calls dont add frames to the C stack. I would like to use a stack of my own that does not grow with tail calls. Like Stackless Python, and unlike Ruby or... standard Python I guess.p  pBut, as my language is a Lisp derivative, all evaluation of sexpressions is currently done recursively because its the most obvious way I thought of to do this nonlinear, highly hierarchical process. I have an eval function, which calls a Lambdaapply function every time it encounters a function call. The apply function then calls eval to execute the body of the function, and so on. Mutual stackhungry nontail C recursion. The only iterative part I currently use is to eval a body of sequential sexpressions.p  precodedefun f x y     a x y  tail call goto instead of call.                do not grow the stack, keep return addr  defun a x y      x y   ...  print f 1 2  how does the return work here how does it know its supposed to                  return the value here to be used by print, and how does it know                  how to continue execution here codepre  pSo, how do I avoid using C recursion Or can I use some kind of goto that jumps across c functions longjmp, perhaps I really dont know. Please bear with me, I am mostly self Internet  taught in programming.p

Negative 2290 pI have been struggling for too long a time now with a rather simple question about how to create a generic linked list in c. The list should be able contain several types of structs, but each list will only contain one type of struct. The problem arises when I want to implement the getNode function [see below], because then I have to specify which of the structs it should return. I have tried to substitute the structs with classes, where the getNode function returns a base class that is inherited by all the other classes, but it still does not do the trick, since the compiler does not allow the getNode function to return anything but the base class then.p  pSo here is some code snippetp  precodetypedef struct struct1       int param1 ...  struct1  typedef struct struct2       double param1 ...  struct2   typedef struct node      struct1 data     node link  node  class LinkedList  public     node first     int nbrOfNodes     LinkedList     void addNodestruct1     struct1 getNode     bool isEmpty   LinkedListLinkedList      first  NULL     nbrOfNodes  0   void LinkedListaddNodestruct1 newData      if nbrOfNodes  0              first  new node         firstgtdata  newData          else              node it  first         for int i  0 i lt nbrOfNodes i                      it  itgtlink                  node newNode  new node         newNodegtdata  newData         itgtlink  newNode          nbrOfNodes   bool LinkedListisEmpty      return nbrOfNodes   struct1 LinkedListgetNode      param1 returnData  firstgtdata     node deleteNode  first     nbrOfNodes     if nbrOfNodes         first  deleteNodegtlink     delete deleteNode     return returnData  codepre  pSo the question, put in one sentence, is as follows How do I adjust the above linked list class so that it can also be used for struct2, without having to create a new almost identical list class for struct2 objects As I said above, each instance of LinkedList will only deal with either struct1 or struct2.

Negative 2290 pstrongScenariostrong I need to create a report for the auditors for an ASP.Net application. I have a program that parses the XML of the web.config files in a directory for the authorization tag and creates a report providing which users have access to which folder in the site structure.

Negative 2290 pIm streaming video to my Motorola Droid 1 using the method from the android tutorial a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcessamplesApiDemossrccomexampleandroidapismediaMediaPlayerDemoVideo.html relnofollowherea. Im getting different behavior from the two different formats Id like to play. The first type youtube lq 3gp plays fine. The second type youtube hq mp4 will start to play the audio before the TIOverlay functions are run so no video, then once the video is drawn its out of sync with the audio. I know the hq mp4 format is supported by my phone because it is the type played by the mobile youtube site which works fine. More info on the formats a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiYouTubeQualityandcodecs relnofollowherea.p  pSo I guess I either need a way to force the TIOverlay to run, or a way to listen for it to be ready and not to start the video until that point. Some logcat output below shows the flow, its interesting when onPrepared is called in both cases. The 3gp seems to do TIOverlay calls before and after onPrepared, while the mp4 only does them after.p  pEdit The same code seems to be working on a Motorola Droid 3. Still, if that video format works on youtube on my Droid 1, I feel like it should work in my app as well. I tried waiting to play the video until it was buffered a little bit. Not only did this not solve the problem, but the buffer also restarted upon starting the video.p  p3GPp  precode1025 165626.750 DEBUGTIOverlay1103 overlaycreateOverlayIN w176 h144 format22 1025

Now the algorithm Im using is this I have a 2d array where the values represent the coordinates of the number. First I assign that every number coordinate in this array will have a value of 10.

Negative 2290 pI am running an Android 4.0 emulator on windows 7 with a valid global ipv6 address. The emulator can access the ipv4 of the host machine addresses but not the ipv6 address. Pinging the ipv6 address from a third party site works.p  pIs there some magic trick to tell the emulator to use IPv6 as well The emulator hasnt really got a lot of configuration options. p  pI always get the message Network is unreachable.p
Negative 2290 pWith JDK 1.6, I can implement a JAXWS based web service without a need to have an external implementation of JAXWS or even without the need of an external servlet container since JDK 1.6 provides both.p  pIt seems to me that for JAXRS, the situation is not the same meaning that to implement a JAXRS web service, I will need to download the reference implementation Called Jersey separately.  p  pAm I correct, or JDK 1.6 comes with Jersey out of the box as well  p

Negative 2290 pI have a Java EE 6 web application that offers its data via a JAXRS REST web service. The entities are annotated with the JPA annotations as well as with the javax.xml.bind JAX annotations. My aim is to assemble a clientjar out of my webapp project that contains the JAXRS annotated DTO classes to be used for JAX unmarshalling in clients of my webapp.p  pPutting the raw entities in the client jar is not an option because of the JPA annotations, which would lead to bogus dependencies for the client.p  pIs there a way for doing this without writing the JAXRS classes twice, for the webapp and the clientsp  pI thought of annotation processing and killing all JPA annotations in the entities, thats quite techy, but not very handy. My second idea is to extract an interface of the needed getterssetters of the entities. The question here is how to handle the JAX annotations that are placed at the class members and at the getters.p  pBoth ways seem to work somehow. But is there a general purpose solution for that taskp  pHint yes, im aware of the way to expose the JPAEntities directly via rest and its coupling drawbacks to evolution etc p

Negative 2290 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions459224jqueryanimateandbrowserperformancejQuery animate and browser performanceap  pI have a problem with the browsers performance. same as above except I am not using setIntervals. I used fadein and fadeout to animate between 4 different pictures, which looked pretty good. But the IE browsers performance was bad. It was using about 100 processor during the animation. It was ok in Firefox and chrome but IE is just bad. For now I used gif animation instead of jquery but the animation looks choppy in gif. Does anyone has a solution for this Thanksp

Negative 2290 pI am evaluating apache poi as an option to write docx files. The specific thing I am looking for is to generate content in the docx file in different languages hindimarathi to be specific. I am facing the following issuep  pWhen the docx file gets written the HindiMarathi text is visible as square boxes even though the font Arial Unicode MS supports it. The point is that when we check the boxes MS Word displays the font as Cailbri, even though i have explicitly set the font to Arial Unicode MS. If i select the boxes in MS Word and then change the font to Arial Unicode MS the hindimarathi words are visible correctly.

Negative 2290 pI have two different files each of whose content is coming from different streams of data. I have some data collected from these streams in two different files. Then i want to search the files to find any sort of patterns, So that at a later stage if i collect some more data from the streams i should be able to distinguish which data belongs to which stream based on the patterns that i have found earlier. p  pAn example of the data contained in the file can be  b0 82 91 a2 c3 89 b0 82 4a e3....more bytes... Though i have taken very few bytes here, but we can find the pattern b0 82 coming twice above. So the output should show the pattern and the no of times it is coming. Similarly we can have 3 byte pattern or even more byte pattern.p  pStill other example can be  aa 00 a7 2f 7b 4c ....more bytes.....aa 01 a7.........more bytes......aa 05 a7..... I think even this can be considered a pattern of 3 bytes where two bytes aa amp a7 are fixed and middle one varies from 00 to 05.p  pThese are two examples that i could think of though there can be more patterns possibly. Even there may be some hidden patterns which cant be visualized immediately. The whole idea is any pattern will do as long as that helps to distinguish between two streams at a later stage. I think i am more clear now on specifying my problem. Please let me know the following things p  ol lipHow can we do this type of pattern findingpli lipAre any tools or libraries which can help for this purpose pli lipAlso which language or tool to use for efficient and faster development pli lipcan the field of data mining help for this purpose  If yes how to go ahead with thatpli ol

Negative 2290 pWent off on an interesting tangent today after reading a hrefhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid91 relnofollowthis article on command handler decorationa. I wanted to see if I could implement the pattern using Unity instead of a hrefhttpssimpleinjector.org relnofollowSimpleInjectora, and so far it is proving extremely difficult. p  pThe first thing I had to do was install a hrefhttpsautoregistration.codeplex.com relnofollowUnityAutoRegistrationa to resolve the open generic codeICommandHandlerltTCommandgtcode interface. Current solution for that aspect is as followsp  precodeContainer  new UnityContainer.LoadConfiguration  Container.ConfigureAutoRegistration     .ExcludeSystemAssemblies     .Includetype gt type.ImplementsOpenGenerictypeofICommandHandlerltgt,         t, c gt c.RegisterTypetypeofICommandHandlerltgt, t          .ApplyAutoRegistration  codepre  pThis works for the first part, resolving any strongsinglestrong codeICommandHandlerltTCommandgtcode. Whats proven frustrating so far is implementing a decoration handler. As soon as I add a second codeICommandHandlerltTCommandgtcode as a decorator, Unity throws a StackOverflowException. I dont know enough about Unity internals, but Im guessing this is because it cant figure out which instance to resolve to  the command handler, or the command handler decorator  since both implement the codeICommandHandlerltTCommandgtcode interface.p  pGoogling around led me a hrefhttpwww.pnpguidance.netpostGenericDecoratorChainsExampleUnityDependencyInjectionContainer.aspx relnofollowfirst to this articlea, which explains how to do it in what I would consider a brute force method. I also found a hrefhttpdavidhayden.comblogdavearchive20081119ChainResponsibilityDesignPatternUnityDependencyInjectionContainer.aspx relnofollowthesea a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions6109646howdoiusethedecoratorpatternwithunitywithoutexplicitlyspecifyingeverrelateda a hrefhttpsunity.codeplex.comdiscussions24015ProjectNameunity relnofollowpagesa but none is a complete solution to my problem and I am too ignorant to figure it out for myself.p  pI then found a hrefhttpwww.beefycode.compostDecoratorUnityContainerExtension.aspx relnofollowthis article, which seems to address my same concernsa. However beefys solution does not account for dealing with open generics. Currently most of our dependencies are loaded from a unity section in the .config file, so I dont want to write a ton of compiled code for each handler or decorator. It seems like having some kind of UnityContainerExtension and DecoratorBuildStrategy is the right way to go, but I cant figure it out.  I have been playing with beefys code for a little while now, and am completely stuck. My attempts to modify his code to account for generics has led to BadImageFormatExceptions An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format. Exception from HRESULT 0x8007000B.p  pI like the idea of doing this to implement the decorator chaining, because its short, and there is only 1 line per concernp  precodevar container  new Container   Go look in all assemblies and register all implementations  of ICommandHandlerltTgt by their closed interface container.RegisterManyForOpenGenerictypeofICommandHandlerltgt,     AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies   Decorate each returned ICommandHandlerltTgt object with an  TransactionCommandHandlerDecoratorltTgt. container.RegisterDecoratortypeofICommandHandlerltgt,     typeofTransactionCommandHandlerDecoratorltgt   Decorate each returned ICommandHandlerltTgt object with an  DeadlockRetryCommandHandlerDecoratorltTgt. container.RegisterDecoratortypeofICommandHandlerltgt,     typeofDeadlockRetryCommandHandlerDecoratorltgt codepre  p...but I dont want to change my container from Unity to Simple Injector if I dont have to. p  pSO my question is how could I go about implementing open generic decorator chaining using unity plus codeUnityAutoRegistrationcodep

Negative 2290 pIve spent hours on this program and have put several hours online searching for alternatives to my methods and have been plagued with crashes and errors all evening p  pI have a few things Id like to achieve with this code.  First Ill explain my problems, then Ill post the code and finally Ill explain my need for the program.p  pThe program outputs just the single words and the concatenate function does nothing.  This seems like it should be simple enough to fix... p  pMy first problem is that I cannot seem to get the concatenate function to work, I used the generic strcat function which didnt work and neither did another version I found on the internet  that function is used here, it is called mystrcat .  I want to have the program read in a string and remove delimiters to create a single string comprised of every word within the original string.  I am trying to do with strtok and a strcat function.  If there is an easier or simpler way PLEASE Im all ears. p  pAnother problem, which isnt necessarily a problem but an ugly mess the seven lines following main.  Id prefer to initialize my variables as follows char variable[amt] but the code I found for strtok was using a pointer and the code for the strcat function was using pointers.  A better understanding of pointers ampamp addresses for strings would probably help me out long term. However I would like to get rid of some of those lines by any means necessary.  I cant have 6 lines dedicated to only 2 variables.  When I have 10 variables I do not want 30 lines up topp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt  char mystrcatchar output, char firstptr  int main   char str[]  now  is the time for all  good men to come to the  aid of their     country char delims[]    char resultOrig[70]    was [20] char firstOrig[20] char result  NULL, first  NULL char result  resultOrig    was result  ampresultOrig char first  firstOrig    was   first  ampfirstOrig  first  strtok str, delims   while first  NULL       mystrcatresultOrig, firstOrig     printf s , first      printfn s  this should be the concatd string so farn, resultOrig     first  strtok NULL, delims    systempause return 0   char mystrcatchar resultptr, char firstptr  char output  resultptr  while output  0     output whilefirstptr  0      output  firstptr     output     firstptr  output  0  return output  codepre  pThis is just a test program right now but I was intending to use this for a listdatabase of files.

And some files have spaces in them already along with the special characters Id like to delimit.p  pIm planning to do all this by means of scanning a text file.

Negative 2290 pSo i have text that is quite a bit longer than some of the components they occupy. I have come up with reasonable solutions for most of the problems, but i dont know what to do with very long text items in combo boxes. If the user can not see the text, he can not make the right decision  especially if the first part of the text matches. See my a hrefhttpwww.sscce.org relnofollowSSCCEa below. p  pI have used a JScrollpane to resolve the issue of long text in a JTextfield and i have used a tooltip to resolve long text in a JXhyperlink field. Also, i ahve a tooltip for the combo box that can display a long item AFTER it has been selected, but ideally i would like to give that option to the user BEFORE he makes his choice. This code example was put together using Netbeans GUI designer great for RAD purposes and the layout is the GroupLayout that the GUI designer uses. p  precodepackage longtextsexample  import javax.swing.JFileChooser  public class MainFrame extends javax.swing.JFrame              Creates new form MainFrame           public MainFrame          initComponents                  This method is called from within the constructor to initialize the form.

Negative 2290 pCurrently I have a DB structure in MySQL with a few dozen tables with various foreign key linkages among them.  All of the data is in files that Im going to load in, so Im hoping I can port the design over to a storage system that works with Drupal 7, since I can simply setup something using the Feeds module to get my data in a way that Drupal 7 likes.  The ultimate purpose of this is for lots of manual human revision, linking together entries in tables with relations and possibly revising some field data that looks wrong.  So the whole goal is to make the human interface for viewing and editing particularly adding relations in Drupal 7.  The question is, what is the proper way for the data to be stored so I have to write as little module code as neededp  pIt seems to me that I would choose one of 3 modules to accomplish this task  p  ul liRelationli liEntity Referenceli liDatali ul  pRelation and Entity Reference would allow me to store all of my data in nodes entities in Drupal 7, so Drupal would have native support for handling all of the stuff.  However, I expect there to be 100s of millions to low billions of nodes with perhaps up to 3 relations to other nodes in each.  How efficiently does Relation or Entity Reference handle this when referencing foreign data and perhaps grabbing referenced data from that reference, and so on with Views and the like  Can they support a node having a null reference, since many will be null until a user can set them so Id need a way to also have a view to find nodes with particular null referencesp  pData is another possibility, but its in alpha and I wonder about its stability and efficiency.  It also seems to me that having all of my data stored in an external MySQL database instead of in Drupal nodes defeats the entire purpose of using Drupal in the first place.  Is my feeling on this correctp  pIm having a difficult time nailing down what I would need to manage my content, which seems odd considering Drupal 7 is a CMS.  I have to be missing something here, but Im not sure what it is.  What is the most mature modules for handlinginterfacing with this large quantity of interrelated data and being able to go through and have a user mostly setting up and managing the links so foreign keys between tables, along with perhaps field data review and revision  Are there any that would sufficep

So this is the casep  pI have a tracking service that collects some data in the browser client and then sends it off to the tracking server.

So in    that case i have to use POST if the profile does not exist. Something like a hrefhttpmydomain.tldprofiles relnofollowhttpmydomain.tldprofilesa and then POST payload have the information to save. If the profile is existing i use PUT and a hrefhttpmydomain.tldprofiles relnofollowhttpmydomain.tldprofilesa and payload of PUT has data to save. All good, but problem is that as far as i understand, xmlhttp does not support PUT. Now is it ok to use POST even though its an updatep  pQuestion 2 As said my service returns some elements to be injected into the DOM, when a track is made. Logically, to keep it RESTful, i guess that i would have to use POSTPUT to update the profile and then GET to get the elements to inject. But to save bandwidth and resources on the serverside, it makes more sense to return the elements with the POSTPUT to profiles, even though its a different resource. What are your take on thisp  pBRSunep  pEDITp  pQuestion 3 In some cases i only want to update the profile and NOT receive back elements. Could i still use same resource and then using a payload parameter to specify if i want elements, e.g. dontreceiveelementstruep

Negative 2290 pWhen I put my Flash game into full screen interactive display mode and set stage.fullScreenSourceRect so that it uses hardware scaling, the performance at any resolution seems to be much better than if I do it without the fullScreenSourceRect. Id really like to use this feature, but the problem is that it seems to be using a 4x blur or some similar algorithm for scaling that leaves everything looking very blurry.p  pIt seems like an odd choice to have a blur as the only available scale mode. I would be much happier with a simple nearestneighbor. I cant find anything about changing the scale algorithm in the documentation. Is there any way to do this while still using hardware accelerationp

And I cant find a way of doing that without any downsides.p  h1What I didh1  pI first added a column to the table to save a custom order.p  precode       id           timestamp         order             1          1000000003           1              2          1000000000           2        codepre  pstrongFirst issuestrong I believe I cant order photos according to two different criteria, because itd be hard to know which one has to be given precedence.p  pSo Im ordering them using the codeordercode column, and strongonlystrong this one. When I added the codeordercode column, I gave each photo a value so that the current order would remain. I now have photos ordered by codeordercode, in the same order as when they were ordered by codetimestampcode.p  pI can now reorder some photos manually, and the other ones will stay where they belong. strongThe first issue has been solved.strongp  pBut now, I want to add a new photo.p  pstrongSecond issuestrong I know when the new photo Im adding has been taken, but my photos arent ordered by their codetimestampcode anymore. This photo needs to be correctly ordered, thus it needs a correct codeordercode value.p  pThis is the issue a emcorrectem codeordercode value.p  pHere are two ways I could handle a new photop  ul liGive it an codeordercode value greater than others. In the previous table, a new photo would be given codeorder  3code. This is obviously a bad idea, since it doesnt take its timestamp into account. A recent photo would still be the last one displayed.li liInsert it where it belongs, according to its timestamp. Looking at the same table, if the timestamp of the new photo was code1000000002code, the new photo would be given codeorder  2code, and the codeordercode of every following photo would be increased by 1.li ul  pThe second solution looks great, except in one case if the order of the photo 2 had been manually changed to lets say 50, the new photo would have been given codeorder  50code even though it belongs among the first photos according to its timestamp.p  h1What I needh1  pWhat I need is a way of ordering photos according to their timestamp strongandstrong to their manuallyset order.p  pMaybe you have a solution to the strongsecond issuestrong I highlighted, or maybe youre aware of a whole other way to deal with this. Either way, thank you for your help.p

The program must allow for ANY .txt file to be read, ergo the program cannot predict what words it will be dealing with.p  pThen, it takes the words and makes them their Pig Latin counterpart, and writes them into a new file.  There are a lot more requirements to this problem but siffice to say, I have every part solved save one...when printng to the new file I am unable to perserve the line spacing.  That is to say, if line 1 has 5 words and then there is a break and line 2 has 3 words and a break...the same must be true for the new file.  As it stands now, it all works but all the converted words are all listed one after the other.p  pI am interested in learning this so I am OK if you all wish to play coy in your answers.  Although I have been at this for 9 hours so semicoy will be appreaciated as well   Please pay close attention to the while statements in the code that is where the file IO action is happening.  I am wondering if I need to utilize the nextLine commands from the scanner and then make a string off that...then make substrings off the nextLine string to convert the words one at a time.  The substrings could be splits or tokens, or something else  I am unclear on this part and token attempts are giving me compiler arrors exceptions java.util.NoSuchElementException  I do not seem to understand the correct call for a split command.

Negative 2290 pI have an issue that I have seen come up in a couple different sites and I have never been able to find a solution. I have noticed that many other people have had similar issues but every fix that I have seen is not working on the site I am currently working on. Basically what I am trying to do is have a responsive layout with a header that has a repeating background that spans the entire window and a body that has a fixed width. The basic html looks like thisp  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idheadergtHeader contentltdivgt     ltdiv idmaincontentgtMain content hereltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pand the css is something like thisp  precodehtml, body       width100  header       width100  maincontent       width1000px  codepre  pThis code is not meant to be representative of what is actually on the site that I am working on but to give you an idea of what we are trying to do. To see the actual html, css, etc. please go to a hrefhttp236887.siteshow.com relnofollowhttp236887.siteshow.coma and take a look at it. The site initially will look fine but if you shrink the size of the window down so that there is a horizontal scroll bar and then scroll to the right and look at the header, you will see that the repeating background is not going to the full width. p  pOne thing that I did find is that removing the width1000px on the maincontent did fix this issue. However, we need that maincontent area to be set to that width. I have also tried setting overflows to hidden and setting floats on the header but nothing seems to correct the issue.p  pThis is especially an issue with AndroidiOS systems which run on tablets, smartphones, etc. Any help that you can give me on this issue would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2290 pI have an Eclipse Feature that Im building that contains a few plugins.  One of the plugins uses the import package statement to declare a dependency on another plugin.p  pThe other plugin has platform specific code and exists in another feature that Im building.  I have two plugins in this feature that have the platform specific code. One for oswin32 archx86 and the other for oswin32 archx8664p  pBoth features are being built and using Tycho and they both have p2 repositories that are successfully available.p  pSo, I made a composite repository that points to both of these repositories, and then I use the Install New Software... command in my RCP app and point to the composite repository to install the first feature I mentioned.p  pThe issue is that when the installation is done, the plugin that has the platform specific code has failed to install correctly.  Specifically, the plugin for the x86 system shows up on my 64bit machine.p

Negative 2290 pI am very new to cocoa development and this could be a question specific to my application. But please help me out.I have worked in iOS programming before. I developed a simple core data based cocoa app from online tutorials to add and remove rows of data from table. I made an archive and saved it as an application on my desktop. IT saves users information. When i double click and open the application from my desktop it is launched. I choose open recent file and use the file that i saved. I make modifications and save it. Now i want the application to open with its information already there. Suppose like if we have a exe file. We input data in textboxes and save it. Next time we open it the data is populated automatically. How can i do that in cocoaOr can i Please ask me questions if you need more information. Thanksp
Negative 2290 pHeres a screenshot of my appp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYqPX5.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe list of fillers that you see are coming from the database and are all tied to multiple capsules.  I dont ever want to show ALL fillers.  I only want to show fillers based on the capsule selected.  There are 4 capsules that the user can select from.  When the user chooses 0 Capsule, for example, I want the Filler list to change to only show fillers related to the 0 Capsule.  Same for the other capsules as well.p  pWhats the best way to dynamically modify the filler list to only show fillers based on the capsule selected  Do I want to make a call to my C method that retrieves the list of fillers and pass in the capsule chosen, which would involve a postback  Or is there a better way to do this via clientsidep

Once the user has selected their image, and the submit button is pressed, the image gets saved to the uploads section in my server.p  pI have found that the best ways to do this are via AJAX, PHP and through an iFrame. Although, most examples online are either not working at all, or are far to complex.p  pTHIS IS AN ASSIGNMENT. But my teacher has stated that we can use any upload script we find online, as long as we reference it.p  pI am limited to Javascript no librarys such as jquery, just plain javascript, PHP, HTML and AJAX.p  pAll help is greatly appreciated, and I am open to all links that you provide also, since I may have missed a few.p  pThanksp

Negative 2290 pUsing WinJS Im trying to display a message to the user who has just hit a continue button that they havent answered the question asked. That displays a dialog Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog with two buttons, which allow the user to choose to answer it now and therefore stay on the uinaswered question or answer it later and therefore proceed straight to the next question. In Javascript, I could normally use a confirm dialog, which would halt execution until the user has made a selection and I could then use the returned value to decide whether or not to display the next question. In WinJS, code execution doesnt halt. Heres my function to display the dialogp  precodefunction doSillyMessagemessage, title      var messagedialogpopup  new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialogmessage, title      Add commands and set their CommandIds     messagedialogpopup.commands.appendnew Windows.UI.Popups.UICommandAnswer now, null, 1     messagedialogpopup.commands.appendnew Windows.UI.Popups.UICommandAnswer later, null, 2       Set the command that will be invoked by default     messagedialogpopup.defaultCommandIndex  0       Show the message dialog     messagedialogpopup.showAsync.donefunction command          if command              if command.id  1                  console.logproceed in popup is false                 proceed  false                          else if command.id  2                  console.logproceed in popup is true                 proceed  true                              codepre  pThe problem is that at the point where doSillyMessage is called, the code doesnt wait and so continues with whatever the current value of the proceed variable happens to be. For example, if the value of proceed is false at the point where doSillyMessage is called, it is also false after doSillyMessage is called and is changed to true if appropriate only later, when I then see in the console proceed in popup is true.

Negative 2290 pWhats the best way to transmit a history of accelerometercompass data to a server p  pI have a very basic Android application that transmits GPS point data to a web server. I would like to now include accelerometercompass data along with these GPS coordinates. The idea is to get a better understanding of the path the device has taken and the forces it has experiences along the trip.p  pI dont want to miss quick accelerometer events such as a sharp bump. But I can see this resulting in a large amount of possibly redundant data getting sent over the wire.p  pIs there a standardised format for storing  transmitting this type of datap  pThanks, Davep

I have looked at many tutorials across the web and cannot find out how to do this with just CSS and HTML. I would like to avoid using javascript or php if possible.

Negative 2290 pmy concern is to find a well fitting framework for developing a cross mobile platform app via phonegap. I am using JQMobile for the User interface.p  pI want to build my Application well structured and modular. That means i want to keep it very well capsulated.p  pI know Backbone.js , Underscore.js , handlebar.js , Mustache.js.... and many more.p  pI am wondering what could be the best method of structuring my apps architecture Moreover Are there big dependencies which result from using those frameworks Which framework is giving me the BEST expandability and performance Boostsp  pIam asking because i hope someone can give me a hint. That would save much time.p  pGreetings p  pChris.p  pEDIT USEFUL Information for readers.p  pMy final decision is based on a hrefhttpcoenraets.orgblogphonegaptutorialhttpcoenraets.orgblogphonegaptutoriala. This is a Tutorial about developing a Phonegap Application. Christophe Coenraets is a Technical Evangelist from Adobe. He gives many advices how to develop Phonegap applications with good performance. The link directs you to a really nice Tutorial for Routing between Views, Css Scrolling with Phonegap and many architectural information more. There is also a 60 minute presentation about Performance  Architecture and more similiar stuff. I am using handlebars.js for HTML templating, fastclick.js to simulate touch for click for more performance and Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework for the responsive Design. p  pAnyway thx for your answersp

Negative 2290 pShort version  Can anyone point me to a more detailed setup guide for trigger.io installation on a fresh windows 8 system beyond the getting started tutorial at a hrefhttpstrigger.iodocscurrentgettingstartedgettingstarted.html relnofollowhttpstrigger.iodocscurrentgettingstartedgettingstarted.htmlap  pLong version  p  pFirst some background  Im not a professional developer, but Im also not a complete novice when it comes to programming stuff.  While I prefer GUI interfaces, Im comfortable with a command line and poking around behind the scenes of things.  I previously did a basic for fun Android app using Eclips and the Android SDK.  Ive also taken a look at PhoneGapBuild and JQueryMobile and was able to make and test a simple app with that.  Im looking to make my first real app, which will be pretty basic  essentially a glorified user manual app that provides various content I have the copyright to for a fee via inapp purchasing.  Trigger.io seems to be the best solution for crossplatform quick development that allows access to the various inapp purchasing APIs.p  pMy system  A Microsoft Surface Pro tablet running Windows 8p  pMy issue  Ive been unable to get the basic hello world app to actually run via either the web firefox option or the android options emulator and debug connection to my android phone.  Building works fine, but that took a little effort to get functional too.  While the getting started guides were a little helpful, there are a lot of things they mention in passing or essentially skim over.  For example, having Java and Python installed is a prereq, but buried in the text of one of the pages.  Ditto for node.js and the actual Android SDK.  Likewise, when i first tried to run the demo app, it automatically downloaded and installed the Android SDK, however it appeared to be an incomplete install when I ran the SDK Manager app.  Right now, I get the following errors when I try to run an app both from the web gui and from the command linep  ul liEmulator  right after choosing attempt to automatically launch the emulator, windows pops up with emulatorarm.exe has stopped working.li liWeb  right after Forge tools running at version 3.3.54, I get an error environment can only contain stringsli liDevice  right after Creating APK with aapt, I get an error [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified.  Examining the forgeerror.log, there are a whole bunch of traceback calls to various python scripts.li ul  pNote my brother, who has a Mac had little trouble installing xcode and the trigger.io toolkit and getting an IOS hello world app to run.  Thus, while Id be happy to trudge through my individual issues, Id suggest that other users might find value in a lower level system setup guide, that assumes you have a stock install of Windows and steps you through everything you need to do, such as install X, add Y to the path, run Z.  p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 2290 pIm currently writing a library where I want the user of my library to implement an interface. From within my library Im calling this implementation.p  pIm using ServiceLoader to instantiate the implementation provided by the integrator and it works just fine. The integrator calls a start method in my library and in the end he gets something in return. The implementation is used to give me some things along the way that I need in order to get to the final result.  Im deliberately not using CDI or any other DI container cause I want to create a library that can be used anywhere. In a desktop application, a spring application an application using guice...p  pNow Im facing a problem. Im creating a showcase in which Im using my own library. Its a webapplication where Im using jsf and CDI. When I instantiate the implementation provided in said webapp from within my library, Im dealing with a noncontainer managed object. But since this implementation needs to use container managed objects Im kinda screwed since this can never work.p  pExample Interface in libp  precodepublic interface Example    public abstract String getInfo  codepre  pImplementation in warp  precodepublic class ExampleImpl implements Example     Inject    private ManagedBean bean    public String getInfo       return bean.getSomethingThatReturnsString      codepre  pAs you can see this is a huge problem in the way my library is build since the bean will always be null... This means no one using a DI container can use my library. I know I can get the managedbean by doing a FacesContext lookup and get the managedbean but more importantly, my library isnt very well designed if you think about it.p  pSo to conclude my questions Is there any way I can make the serviceloader use a DI container to instantiate the classp  pAnyone who knows a better way to fix my problemp  pAnyone who knows a better way to get the things I need without making the integrator implement an interface but I can get information from the integratorp  pI know this is a quite abstract question but Im kinda stuck on this one.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2290 pIve been studying a lot of the common ways that developers designarchitect an application on domain driven design Still trying to understand the concept as a whole. Some of the examples that I saw included the use of events via an event aggregator. I liked the concept because it truly keeps the different elementsdomains of an application decoupled.p  pA concern that I have is how do you rollback an operation in the case of an errorp  pFor examplep  pSay I have an order application that has to save an order to the database and also save a copy of the order as a pdf to a CMS. The application fires an event that a new order has been created and the pdf service that subscribes to this event saves the pdf. Meanwhile when committing the order changes to the database an exception is thrown. The problem is that the pdf has been saved but their isnt a matching database record. p  pShould I cache the previously handled events and fire a new error event that looks to the cache for undo operations Use something like the command pattern for this p  pOr... is the event aggregator not a good pattern for this. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIm starting to think that maybe events should be used for less mission critical items, such as emailing and logging. p  pMy initial thought was to limit dependencies by using the event aggregator pattern.p

Negative 2290 pBasically I have an issue that stems from Joomla 3.1s JSON handling, although because I cannot isolate it I am making this question for direction on it. This will hopefully serve to isolate if this is a bug I should report or something in my application.p  pJoomla 3.1 seems to have a plugin, or some sort of JSON handling in either the default codemodelgtsavecode or codetablegtsavecode. This can lead to unwanted additions to JSON fields when saving any kind of page. So far looking through the code for them I have been unable to isolate it witch makes me think plugin, though I only have default enabled.p  pSo here is the questionp  pstrongDoes Joomla do any JSON handling of form inputs If so can it be disabledstrongp  pTo clarify on my personal problem, I have a skeleton component save feature saves a few minor values to the database, one column is a JSON field. It uses codeJModelAdmincode and through it codeJTablecodefor handling the saving of the content. However every item in the JSON array it is an array of objects gets duplicated every time it saves. Considering it is a string in a hidden form when it is saved, somewhere in the process it is being parsed into a php array and duplicated by Joomla. Since there is no custom code in the actual saving process it is likely that Joomla has some need to edit JSON values elsewhere and my component triggered it.p  phere is the form xml if this has anything to do with it, the codevaluescode hidden form field is what should contain the json, it works until you save.

I think its relatively straightforward for someone familiar with OpenGL, but if you have any questions ask.p  pEDIT The problem now is that the texture is showing up wrong.The code and result picture have been edited to reflect this change.p  precodeprivate int amountOfVertices private int vertexSize private int textureSize private int vboVertexHandle private int vboTextureHandle private boolean canDraw  false  public BlockBlockType type, Location loc     this.type  type     this.loc  loc      initRendering  private void initRendering      amountOfVertices  24     vertexSize  3     textureSize  2      FloatBuffer vertexData  BufferUtils.createFloatBufferamountOfVertices  vertexSize     float[] vertices                 X     Y     Z           R     G     B              face 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,         vertex 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,         vertex 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,         vertex 2               face 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,         vertex 2                face 2             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,       vertex 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 2                face 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,      vertex 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,       vertex 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,         vertex 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 2               face 4             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,       vertex 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,        vertex 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,      vertex 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,     vertex 2               face 5             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,       vertex 0             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,      vertex 1             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,      vertex 3             1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,      vertex 2              6 faces with 4 vertices with 6 components floats           System.out.printlnvertices.length     vertexData.putvertices       vertexData.flip       FloatBuffer textureData  BufferUtils.createFloatBufferamountOfVertices  textureSize     textureData.putnew float[]             1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,              1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,              1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,              1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,              1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,              1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,          textureData.flip      vboVertexHandle  glGenBuffers     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vboVertexHandle     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, vertexData, GLSTATICDRAW     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0       vboTextureHandle  glGenBuffers     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vboTextureHandle     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, textureData, GLSTATICDRAW     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0   Override public void render       ifhasBeenRendered     ifamt  0         amt  1     else ifcanDraw         return           canDraw  true     glPushMatrix              glTranslatefloc.getX, loc.getY, loc.getZ         glRotatefx, 1, 1, 0         glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLNEAREST         glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLNEAREST          glBindTextureGLTEXTURE, type.getTexture.getTextureID         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, type.getTexture.getTextureID           glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vboVertexHandle         glVertexPointervertexSize, GLFLOAT, 0, 0L          glBindTextureGLARRAYBUFFER, vboTextureHandle         glTexCoordPointertextureSize, GLFLOAT, 0, 0L          glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY         glEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY         glDrawArraysGLQUADS, 0, amountOfVertices         glDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY         glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY           glPopMatrix  codepre  pa hrefhttpgyazo.com715f6e5659f7c399c7b8a53b27a47fa4.png relnofollowThe output looks something like thisa. p  pIf you need any more information please let me know, Ive been struggling with this a lot.

Negative 2290 pAs I have understood so far Javascript is single threaded. If you defer the execution of some procedure, you just schedule it queue it to be run next time the thread is free. But Async.js defines two methods codeAsyncparallel amp AsyncparallelLimitcode, and I quotep  ul liparalleltasks, [callback]li ul  blockquote   pRun an array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous function has completed.

Negative 2290 pIm doing a little university project where I apply different multithreading approaches to pattern matching algorithms pthread, omp and compare them against their respective sequential implementations.p  pAt the moment it works well, and depending on the algorithm and gcc optimizations, I get shorter run times by a factor of about 2  3.p  pNow, Id like to do it using stdthread as well, however, from what Ive managed to gather, theyre implemented using Pthreads on Linux, so I was wondering whether there was any point to this.p

Negative 2290 pLets say Im on a screen editing a post and its associated metadata. Now, the post has many categories, tags, and possibly other related items hasMany.p  pWhen saving the entire post, I have to save the post and every single entity associated with it. This is how I do it in AngularJSp  ol lipAll the data is stored in a separate model so that it can be universally accessed. Each related entity has multiple metadata indicating whether theyre new, dirty, or whether they have serverside validation errors.pli lipA different controller called SaveCtrl manages saving. It goes through all the entities of a post, figures out the ones that have changed, and only sends them along with the post to a single save endpoint.pli lipI have a factory that parses the response from the server. An element might not get saved due to a serverside validation error. Regardless, once we get the response, each of those entities have to be updated with the new state and validation errors. This allows the serverside to update entities without any errors, while returning errors for the few that did have validation errors.pli ol  pNow, here are some problems with this approachp  ol lipThe saving is not entirely RESTful. While retrieving data, I believe I should probably make multiple GET calls for each resource a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4409877urldesignforanapi44119294411929URL design for an APIa. However, I dont know of a similar approach for saving. Should I save a collection, or a single entity at a timepli lipThe metadata for each entity specifying whether its new, dirty, saved, or unsaved has to be put in the model data itself. Since ngrepeat creates a separate scope, Id ideally like to save such state information in these separate scopes, with the ngrepeat elements wrapped in a controller thatd handle this.pli ol  h3My questionh3  pWhich strategy should I use to save an entire post with all its related entities Or is my present strategy good enough Let me know if there are some additional details required.p

Negative 2290 pIm using AndroidStudio with maven. what i dont understand is how duplicate classes dont confuse classloaders nor the build process.p  pI made my own codeandroid.util.Logcode class like, i made a codeandroid.utilcode package inside my app, and inside it i made my own codeLogcode class, instead of using the standard android codeLog.dcode, i use my own. How and why does this workp  pive read somewhere that there are 3 classloaders  your application classloader, 3rd party libs classloader, and system classloaders. so is it that they go in some kind of priority, where if your application classloader finds the .class file then it gets linked and any other duplicate .class files just dont matterp  pand... why isnt this behaviour causing any kind of build errorswarningsp  pan example is that ... say i want to use reflection to call a certain private class that both i and android will provide. i want guarantee that whether or not it calls mine or ANdroids, theres not clash that causes a crash. but id like to know exactly whyhow it works the way im seeing it work.p

Can someone help me figure this out and explain to me what is going on The form looks exactly how you think it would however i took out the forms method and action attributes because i figured they would be handled in the below script.  p  precode  Send function                ifsubmitbutton  1                 var dataString  name name  ltbrgtemail  email  ltbrgtphone  phone                   alert dataStringreturn false                   .ajax                        var name  inputname.val                        var phone  inputphone.val                        var email  inputemail.val                     type POST,                     url mailer.php,                     data dataString,                     success function                         this .dialog close                                                          return false                              else ifsubmitbutton  2                 var dataString  name name  ltbrgtemail  email  ltbrgtphone  phone                   alert dataStringreturn false                   .ajax                        var name  inputname2.val                        var phone  inputphone2.val                        var email  inputemail2.val                     type POST,                     url mailer2.php,                     data dataString,                     success function                         this .dialog close                                                        return false                            else ifsubmitbutton  0                  error.cssdisplay,                        , codepre
Negative 2290 pIve been researching for an Arduino project I will be starting soon and I came across some relevant code Uncommented... but I cant seem to decipher how the most important part works The way the code should work is there are 4 bytes in question yaw, pitch, throttle, and trim all dec values and each bit in each byte corresponds to a sequence of LED flashes encoded in the sendZero and sendOne commands. Here is the code in questionp  precodevoid sendCommand       byte b      sendHeader      for int i0 ilt7 i           b  yaw amp 1 ltlt i gtgt i         if b gt 0 sendOne else sendZero            for int i0 ilt7 i           b  pitch amp 1 ltlt i gtgt i         if b gt 0 sendOne else sendZero            for int i0 ilt7 i           b  throttle amp 1 ltlt i gtgt i         if b gt 0 sendOne else sendZero            for int i0 ilt7 i           b  trim amp 1 ltlt i gtgt i         if b gt 0 sendOne else sendZero         codepre  pThe part that gets me is the inside of each forloop as I have no clue whats going on with those bitwise operations. My guess is they are somehow converting the dec value into binary and then iterating through it, registering zeros or ones accordingly Its this p  pb  x amp 1 ltlt i  ip  pwhere I cant seem to see whats going on or why. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 2290 pBased on the information here a hrefhttpdocs.valence.desire2learn.comrescourse.htmlactions relnofollowhttpdocs.valence.desire2learn.comrescourse.htmlactionsa I would expect that to update a courseOffering I would specify a PUT with a CourseOfferingInfo block, which only contains a few attributes.  Every time I try this, I get a 404, not found  even using the same route for a successful GET 404 says org doesnt exist OR org is not an offering  neither is true.  However, if I specify a CreateCourseOffering block directly from a previous GET, the PUT works fine.  Is this correct and the documentation not  Or are there other things I should look for in this scenario  The documentation says use CreateCourseOffering for the POST to create an offering I simply want to update one attribute of that offering and as such thought the PUT was the way to go.p

Negative 2290 pI recently got a Sony MEX BT4100U car radio with support for the App Remotefeature. Sony offers a apps which bring Smart Extras to this radio. Its possible to hear tweets from twitter or the contents of an RSS feed through this addons without touching the phone.p  pI am wondering if its possible to use the Sony AddOn SDK  Smart Extension API to extend the functionality by myself. The list of target devices in the SonySDK does not include any Sony Automotive devices but a set of smartwatches and headsets.p  pDoes anyone has experience with this topic and is able to point out if its generally possible to extend the radio functionality via the mentioned SDK or do I have to deal with some closed pluginarchitecturep  pMy goal is to write an extension which will warn me of speed cameras via text to speech, as soon as a new speed camera is on my route. The warning should be displayed on the car radio, regardless of the configured audio source.p  pDoes anyone havep  ul lithe information if this SDK is the right choice to control this type of Sony deviceli liif its possible to reach my described goal with it or if there are any impossibilitiesli liother related information or special requirements for controlling Sony automotive devices via bluetoothli ul  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 2290 pBy using codebwmorphcode, one can identify the branch points in a skeleton and by subtracting them from the skeleton image, the residual image is left with the different branches.

Negative 2290 pI am using transactions in my unit tests to roll back changes. The unit test uses a dbcontext, and the service im testing uses his own. Both of them are wrapped in one transaction, and one dbcontext is in the block of the other. The thing is, when the inner dbcontext saves his changes, its not visible to the outer dbcontext and i dont think its  because the other dbcontext might already have the object loaded. Here is the examplep  precode[TestMethod] public void EditDepartmentTest      using TransactionScope transaction  new TransactionScope              using MyDbContext db  new MyDbContext                      Arrange             int departmentId  from d in db.Departments                                    where d.Name  Dep1                                    select d.Id.Single             string newName  newName,                    newCode  newCode              Act             IDepartmentService service  new DepartmentService             service.EditDepartmentdepartmentId, newName, newCode              Assert             Department department  db.Departments.FinddepartmentId             Assert.AreEqualnewName, department.Name,Unexpected department name             Exception is thrown because department.Name is Dep1 instead of newName             Assert.AreEqualnewCode, department.Code, Unexpected department code                codepre  pThe servicep  precodepublic class DepartmentService  IDepartmentService      public void EditDepartmentint DepartmentId, string Name, string Code              using MyDbContext db  new MyDbContext                       Department department  db.Departments.FindDepartmentId              department.Name  Name             department.Code  Code              db.SaveChanges                 codepre  pHowever, if I close the outer dbcontext before calling the service and open a new dbcontext for the assert, everything works finep  precode[TestMethod] public void EditDepartmentTest      using TransactionScope transaction  new TransactionScope              int departmentId0         string newName  newName,                newCode  newCode          using MyDbContext db  new MyDbContext                      Arrange             departmentId  from d in db.Departments                                    where d.Name  Dep1                                    select d.Id.Single                   Act         IDepartmentService service  new DepartmentService         service.EditDepartmentdepartmentId, newName, newCode          using MyDbContext db  new MyDbContext                      Assert             Department department  db.Departments.FinddepartmentId             Assert.AreEqualnewName, department.Name,Unexpected department name             Assert.AreEqualnewCode, department.Code, Unexpected department code                codepre  pSo basically i have a solution for this problem thought of it during the writing of this question but i still wonder why it isnt possible accessing uncommitted data in the transaction when the dbcontexts are nested. Could it be becuase usingdbcontext is like a transaction itself If so, i still dont understand the issue since im calling .SaveChanges on the inner dbcontext.p

Negative 2290 pI am writing a program to control the drone using a C program. I am using the AT commands to control the drone.

on the send button then it can update my location. p  pi heard there is a new Location API for more accuracy but what is the difference between that and mine at the Google developer page there are not

Now Ive been trying to do the same thing in codeCCLIcode as he only codes in codeCCLIcode and its turning out to be a lot more complicated.. p  pFirst of all there is no dynamic keyword in codeCCLIcode so translating the code example from that guide didnt really seem to work. I found a hrefhttpoldschooldotnet.blogspot.se201104scriptingccliwithironpythonvisual.html relnofollowanother examplea specifically for codeCCLIcode but it doesnt actually work anymore, Im guessing it is for an old version of IronPython.

Negative 2290 pData I send to the serial port from the Arduino Uno can be viewed exactly as expected in the Arduino serial monitor, but when reading the data from PHP through serproxy in my WAMP environment I am getting some missing or extra characters often a character that looks like a question mark inside of a black diamond, for example.p  pIve found similar questions posted, but all of the answers fell short.

I received a Module winserial is not compiled into PHP after following all of the steps. If anyone else has had this issue please let me know as I would be willing to look into this again.pli lipFinally, I tried using a program called a hrefhttpfreecode.comprojectsserproxy relnofollowserproxya which redirects network sockets to and from serial ports. This emdoesem work with the caveat that I added a 10uF capacitor on the Arduinos GND and RESET pins to prevent reseting on new serial connections as mentioned at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13114275phpserialportdatareturnfromarduinoPHP serial port data return from Arduinoa.pli ul  pSo now, I have my Arduino sending data to my computer via the USB cable, and so long as I am monitoring the data in Arduinos serial monitor, everything looks as it should.

This page is called via jQuery from another page every 10th of a second and the echoed content is loaded into the contents of a  on my main page. p  pMy end goal is to send a stream of either 1s or 0s to be sent to my PHP script to indicate that a  should toggle its background color. I would prefer to be certain those 1s or 0s were not just randomly echoed among the extra characters and truly came from the serial stream itself.p  pDoes anyone know if serproxy is the cause of the adding or removing the unwanted data that Im seeing in PHP  p  pThe fact that the serial monitor is showing the correct data indicates to me that its something in the way PHP is receiving or parsing the data. p  pIm running out of ideas on what else I could check.

Negative 2290 pWhat is the canonical way to derive from one of the fancy iterators of the thrust frameworkp  pIm storing 3D points in a structure of arrays. Now I was thinking about a convenient way to get a blas vector type from that. What I came up with was something like thisp  precodenamespace abc    typedef VERYBASICLINEARALGEBRAVECTORCLASSFORTESTING tvector   typedef typename thrustdevicevectoriterator tbaseIterator   typedef typename thrusttuplelttbaseIterator,tbaseIterator,tbaseIteratorgt titeratorTuple   typedef typename thrustzipiteratorlttiteratorTuplegt tzipIterator    struct customiterator public tzipIterator      customiteratortzipIterator zi tzipIteratorzi      tvector getVector        return tvectorthis          void setVectorconst tvectoramp v        this  ttuplev          codepre  pThis works. Which means I can do something like codeit.getVectorcode where codeitcode is a valid customiterator, and pass this customiterators to thrusts compute primitives, like transformreduce. Ive searched a little bit more about the documentation of thrust and found codethrustiteratoradaptorcode. Now the question should one rather use codeiteratoradaptorcode If so, why What are the pros and cons of above piece of code. It seems rather  exaggerated using codeiteratoradaptorcodep  precodeinclude ltthrustiteratoriteratoradaptor.hgt class customiterator public thrustiteratoradaptorltcustomiterator, tzipIteratorgt      public     typedef thrustiteratoradaptorltcustomiterator, tzipIteratorgt supert      customiteratorconst tzipIterator ampzi  supertzi       tvector getVector          return tvectorthis          void setVectorconst tvectoramp v          this  ttuplev           friend class thrustiteratorcoreaccess  codepre  pI dont know if this works, as I didnt try.p  pSo the question is What is the canonical way doing thisp  pRelated to this is another question A functor used by thrusttransformreduce or thrusttransformiterator must accept the underlying type of a given iterator, not the iterator itself. So above customiterator is pretty much useless. Is there a way to accept an iterator instead of an dereferenced iterator in the operator member function of the used functorp  pYou may ask yourself why I want a derived iterator with this additonal getters and setters, as above examples suggest that codetvectorcode is initialised with the underling tuple of the zipiterator anyway. But this is only an example, and there is a more complex case, where above concept would be a very convenient way to go.p

Negative 2290 pThe topic of changing the Dojo DataGrid row background has been previously discussed on this board as well as the Dojo documentation, which gives a full example a hrefhttpdojotoolkit.orgreferenceguide1.9dojoxgridDataGrid.html relnofollowhttpdojotoolkit.orgreferenceguide1.9dojoxgridDataGrid.htmla.p  pMy issue is a little bit different. I need to change the background color of the rows based on a common field  lets call it CityId. If two rows have the same CityId, then they should have the same background. Note that this question is not concerned with the grouping nor ordering of the data in the grid, but only with the changing of the row style for adjacent rows sharing a common ID field.p  pThe two main paths for this issue involve either hooking into the onStyleRow event or the private onFetchComplete event.p  pHeres my onStyleRow attemptp  precodevar idx  0 var prevId  0 function myStyleRowrow      var item  grid.getItemrow.index     ifitem          var currId  store.getValueitem, CityId, null         if  currId                if  prevId  currId                   prevId  currId                 idx                           if  idx2  0                   row.customStyles  backgroundcolorFFF000              else                  row.customStyles  backgroundcolor000                                grid.focus.styleRowrow     grid.edit.styleRowrow  codepre  pwhich gets called during the grid creation among other parametersp  precodegrid  new dojox.grid.DataGridonStyleRowmyStyleRow codepre  pThe reason why this approach is unstable is because the onStyleRow event gets triggered on mouse hover, causing the rows to be repainted due to the prevId value. I would like to know whetherhow I could disable onStyleRow from triggering on mouse hovers. This would solve my issue.p  pIn the onFetchComplete approach, I am stuck trying to find a way to access grid rows. Heres my codep  precodevar idx  0 var prevId  0 grid.connectgrid, onFetchComplete, function       wait until everything is loaded     for var i in grid.pendingrequests          if grid.pendingrequests[i]             return                      parse through row data     for  var j0 j lt grid.rowCount j          var item  grid.getItemj         ifitem              var currId  store.getValueitem, CityId, null             if  currId                    if  prevId  currId                       prevId  currId                     idx                                   if  idx2  0                       row.customStyles  backgroundcolorFFF000                  else                      row.customStyles  backgroundcolor000                                              codepre  pThis is obviously a work in progress as there are two missing points a way to iterate through the grids rows grid.rowCount does not work properly and a way to fetch the grids rows in order to apply the custom styles. I could not find something like grid.getRow to address the issue.p  pAny pointers are appreciated.p

Negative 2290 h1The data seth1  pI have a big data frame with millions of rows and more than 20 columns. Let me first describe what the data is to make question more clear. The original data frame consists of locations, velocities and accelerations of 2169 vehicles during a 15 minute period. Each vehicle has a unique codeVehicle.IDcode, an ID of the time frame in which it was observed i.e. codeFrame.IDcode, the velocity of vehicle in that frame i.e. codesvelcode, the acceleration of vehicle in that frame i.e. codesacccode and the class of that vehicle, codevehicle.classcode, i.e. 1 motorcycle, 2 car, 3  truck. These variables were recorded after every 0.1 seconds i.e. each frame is 0.1 seconds. Here are the first 6 rowsp  precodegt dputheaddf structurelistVehicle.ID  c2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, Frame.ID  133138,      Vehicle.class  c2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, Lane  c2L, 2L,      2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, svel  c37.29, 37.11, 36.96, 36.83, 36.73,      36.64, sacc  c0.07, 0.11, 0.15, 0.19, 0.22, 0.25, .Names  cVehicle.ID,  Frame.ID, Vehicle.class, Lane, svel, sacc, row.names  77507755, class  data.frame codepre  pThere are some instances in vehicles journey during the 15 minute recording period that they completely stop i.e. codesvel0code. This continues for some frames and then vehicles gain speed again. For the purpose of reproduciblity I am creating an example data set as followsp  precodex lt data.frameVehicle.ID  crep10,5, rep20,5, rep30,5, rep40,5, rep50,5,                     vehicle.class  crep2,10, rep3,10,rep1,5,                     svel  repc1,0,0,0,3,5,                     sacc  repc0.3,0.001,0.001,0.002,0.5,5 codepre  h1What do I want to findh1  pAs described above some vehicles stop and have zero velocity for some time but later accelerate to get up to speed. I want to find the acceleration, codesacccode they apply after having zero velocity for some time moving from standstill position. This means that I should be able to look at the FIRST row AFTER the last frame in which codesvel0code. In the example data this means that the car codevehicle.class2code having a codeVehicle.ID10code had a velocity, codesvelcode equal to 1 as seen in the first row. Later, it stopped for 3 frames 3 consecutive rows and then accelerated to velocity, codesvelcode, equal to 3. I want the acceleration codesacccode it applied in those 2 frames rows 4 and 5 for vehicle 10, which come out to be 0.002 and 0.500. This means that for example data, following should be the output by codevehicle.classcodep  precodeoutput lt data.frameVehicle.ID  c10,10,20,20,30,30,40,40,50, 50,                      vehicle.class  c2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,1,1,                      xf  repcl,f,10,                      sacc  repc0.002,0.500,5 codepre  pcodexfcode identifies the last row codelcode in which codesvel0code and codefcode is the first one after that.

If a user is trying to change the Name property to a name of another recipe, I would like the PropertyGrid to prevent that as if we typed text in a numeric field. Ideally, the Name property wouldnt change. If thats not possible then it will change, validation will fail and the change will be reverted.p  pSince each Recipe object is only aware of itself and not aware of the other recipes, how can I how can I prevent the user from changing the name of the Recipe object to a name that existsp  pHere are the approaches I consideredp  ol liValidation with TypeConverter. Seems like TypeConverter is the right tool for validations so that would be the preferred approach. Problem I need a list of existing names for the validation, and I cant pass any arguments to TypeConverter.li liImplementing INotifyChangedProperty. The Recipe object will notify the change using an event, send the old and the new values, and the list will listen to the event, validate and will revert the change if needed. It will probably work, but Im hoping theres a more elegant solution. I also dont know how to reflect that in the PropertyGrid as an error message.li liObservableCollection. It only observes addingremoving items. Not changes to these items.li liInclude a reference in Recipe to the RecipeList and use the setter to validate changes and throw an exception if validation fails.

Perhaps there is some sort of setting that can be turned onoff that may increase performancep  pNote Weve since moved to VS2013, and I no longer see these performance problems.  Still not sure what was going on behind the scenes that was causing it.p

Negative 2290 pI was wondering if anybody has had to write a program which moves a folder from shared with me to My Drive.

There is code to cop the file, but I do not want to create a copy, I want to move the location of the file from the Shared with me folder to the My Drive folder. I do not have any ideas as I have looked and looked and looked without finding anything related to moving a file, and I also cannot post any code snippets as I have none. p  pstrongEDITstrong This is being done on a service account and being shared with thousands of users, so currently they would all need to authorize the app. We want to be able to share it with them and put it into their drive too.

Negative 2290 pI am using the following Macro that uses filename pipe. But get an error saying invalid option name dir, etc. I suspect it could be due to the quotes while defining filename and pipe.

Negative 2290 pbefore getting to question I should tell you that Im a rookie. p  pMy problem is I have 2 cursors on different sql connections, first cursor gets results from sql database, while second cursor makes changes to rows in the results.

I have tried deleteing the app, restarting the phone etc. I have also tried to create a folder called Base.lproj and put the english translations in there. It still defaults to norwegian. Whyp

Negative 2290 pFirst, Ive googled and searched and read questions here on SO for hours, and am at my wits end... Im a Rails newbie and pretty much new at all this, working on a task manager site as a project. I am trying to make a list of projects, in the projectsindex.html.erb view, be able to be dragged around to a different position, and then be saved in that spot. So far I have figured out, using jQuery, how to make the project items draggable, and thatss great. But upon refreshing the page, its back to the original list order. I made a gist of the files in question, which I will post below. Also, I found an answer to a similar question on here, but I dont have any familiarity with AJAX...I have this code in my project.js now, but I do not know what to do for the put your AJAX call here part you can see it in my gist...or if that is even the right thing to do. Any help on this, I would greatly appreciate itp  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comvtboyarca4d59c4dabce958f3788 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comvtboyarca4d59c4dabce958f3788ap

Negative 2290 pSo I have a bit of a mindboggler on my hands thats refusing to bend. My objective is to log on a database every single time a page is visited. I have created on the c side code that logs this info and I know it works. What Im trying to do now is relatively straightfoward every time an item that is, a page is clicked on the home view list which acts as a shell for the SPA and doesnt change, send the page name to a function in Javascript which will in turn communicate to the Webmethod. The problem is, when the app starts, as it is a SPA, it collects all the divs see below and renders them and for some reason, it does not want to communicate and pass parameters into the javascript function, no matter where I put it Ive put it on a header, Ive put it underneath the html, etc. The onclick function works fine when test it separately, but in this application, it refuses to work.p  pIve also tried using body onloadPostName as well as window.onload on each of the pages to invoke the function but its also a blank. Some thoughts on where the problem might bep  precodelttr classrowgt         lttdgt             ltdiv classtabbablegt                 ltul classnav navtabs navstacked idmenuTabsgt                     ltli classactivegtlta hrefland datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameHomegtHomeltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hreftutuwaroadshow datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameRoadshowsgtTutuwa roadshowsltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hreffaqsandpresentations datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameFaqsgtFAQs and presentationsltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hrefexamplescenarios datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameExampleScenariosgtExample scenariosltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hreffinancialadvisors datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameFinancialAdvisorsgtFinancial advisorsltagtltligt                     ltltli classgtlta hrefprivateclients datatoggletabgtPrivate Clientsltagtltligtgt                     ltli classgtlta hreftrustdeeds datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameTrustDeedsgtTrust deedsltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hrefnewsflashes datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameNewsflashesgtNewsflashesltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hrefusefullinksandcontacts datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameUsefulgtUseful links and contactsltagtltligt                     ltli classgtlta hrefwebinar datatoggletab onclickjavascriptPostNameWebinargtWebinarltagtltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classnewsflashgtlta hrefContentfilesTutuwa20Newsflash204.pdf targetblankgtClick here for the latest newsflash.ltagtltdivgt         lttdgt         lttd rowspan2gt             ltdiv classtabcontentgt                 ltdiv classtabpane active idlandgtHtml.PartialLandltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idtutuwaroadshowgtHtml.PartialTutuwaRoadshowltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idfaqsandpresentationsgtHtml.PartialFaqsAndPresentationsltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idexamplescenariosgtHtml.PartialExampleScenariosltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idfinancialadvisorsgtHtml.PartialFinancialAdvisors ltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idprivateclientsgtHtml.PartialPrivateClientsltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idtrustdeedsgtHtml.PartialTrustDeedsltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idnewsflashesgtHtml.PartialNewsFlashesltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idusefullinksandcontactsgtHtml.PartialUsefulLinksAndContactsltdivgt                 ltdiv classtabpane idwebinargtHtml.PartialWebinarltdivgt             ltdivgt                      lttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pthe function, currently sitting on the headerp  precodeltheadgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function PostNamepageName      debugger     String PageName  ExampleScenarios     .ajax     type POST,     url HomeControllerSaveVisitorHits,     data  s pageName ,     contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,     dataType json,     success function msg      do nothing     ,     error function e       do nothing                    ltscriptgt      lttitlegtlttitlegt ltheadgt codepre  pNote that when I seperate this code from the app, it works fine see a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcLp6y51c relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcLp6y51ca as was created by another user who was trying to help earlier on.

Negative 2290 pI am using libxml2 codexmlTextReadercode in order to parse some XML files. It has constructor functions like codexmlReaderForFilecode to create readers. Once I have a reader I can set error handler to intercept all possible errors, but if the function creating the reader fails, I only know there was an error, no idea what kind of error file missing, access denied, IO error, missing symlink target, and so on. Is there any mechanism through those functions report additional information about errorsp  pIve already tried codexmlSetGenericErrorFunccode, codexmlSetStructuredErrorFunccode and codexmlGetLastErrorcode, and they all give nothing. I noticed that codeerrnocode has an appropriate value after those calls means it correctly reports conditions I simulated for testing, but I assume that it is only because libxml uses functions from standard library, and it leaves the value those functions set after an error. There doesnt seem to be any statement however, that this is intentional, and therefore I have no guarantee that after receiving error code libxml will not either call some other stdlib functions that will reset codeerrnocode, or even reset codeerrnocode explicitly.p

Negative 2290 pI am currently working on a phone directory application. For this application I get a flat file csv from corporate SAP that is updated daily that I use to update an sql database twice a day using a windows service. Additionally, users can add themselves to the database if they do not exist ie is not included in the SAP file. Thus, a contact can be of 2 different types SAP or ECOM.p  pSo, the Windows service downloads the file from a SAP ftp, deletes all existing contacts in the database of type SAP and then adds all the contacts on the file to the database. To insert the contacts into the database some 30k, I load them into a codeDataTablecode and then make use of SqlBulkCopy. This works particularly, running only a few seconds.p  pThe only problem is the fact that the primary key for this table is an autoincremented identity. This means that my contact ids grows at a rate of 60k per day. Im still in development and my ids are in the area of 20milp  precodehttplocalhostCityPhoneContactDetails21026374 codepre  pI started looking into reseeding the id column, but if I were to reseed the identity to the current highest number in the database, the following scenario would pose issuesp  ol liWindows Service Loads 30 000 contactsli liUser creates entry for himself id  30 001li liWindows Service deletes all SAP contacts, reseeds column to after current highest id 30 002li ol  pAlso, I frequently query for users based on this this id, so, Im concerned that making use of something like a GUID instead of an autoincremented integer will have too high a price in performance. I also tried looking into codeSqlBulkCopyOptions.KeepIdentitycode, but this wont work. I dont get any ids from SAP in the file and if I did they could easily conflict with the values of manually entered contact fields. Is there any other solution to reseeding the column that would not cause the id column values to grow at such an exponential ratep

Negative 2290 pCould someone be so kind to help me understand how to use the alphabeta pruning algorithm Im making a game similar to connect four. The only differences is there is no diagonal win, and a player can mark an square at any given time unless it is already occupied, of course.

I dont get the 3 bars. When I debug the code below and I step through when the bars are getting created the layouts, the width and height in the layoutparams are not being set correctly. I see negative values here, which is right for MATCHPARENT but not for the actual width. I see a legit value for the calculated width. So...

So I try changing the folders name from fontawesome4 to fontawesome, and the FA icons are working... except that I have to add class fa. Im not sure if the problem is related to how I upgrade the version and the fact that I change the folders name, I put it here just for your information.p

All the javafiles are stored under codesrcmainjavacode and jspcssxml are under codewebresourcescode and codewebWEBINFcode. p  pThe question is where I have to store all resource files when developing The idea to put them under codesrcmainresorcescode doesnt seem to me elegant because default folders structures is dislocated.

We only need one of the input fields to have a value. When the form is submitted another directive is run cf. the numbervalidation above. This simply checks if any of the model values have something greater than zero entered. If so it validates the control in question. However if the user uses a touch screen and increments the value for one of the fields further down the page, every input field up to the field with the value is seen as invalid. This is because until it actually gets to the field with the value the model value doesnt appear to be set. I dumped the model array form.numberArray to the console in the validation directive and could see that each value was being appended each time the validation directive was run.p  pWhat I need is to have the model update when the button is touched. I tried using scope.parent.apply but simply got an in progress error.p  pAny suggestions, guidance or recommendations gratefully received. p

However, with that solution I loose the adapter unless I build a container view which is probably more complex than building a layout manager.p  pHow would you go about solving such a problem Tips are appreciated, I dont need code examples, just ideas which path is the best to solve this problem.p  pThanks.p  pemApologies if Ive misunderstood the guidelinesemp  pstrongEdit How I resolved this problemstrong My first solution to use RecyclerView with a special Decorator seemed promising, but it remained a hack so we decided not to go for that solution since we were afraid of the complications that it would create down the line.p  pTo solve the problem I went with a SurfaceView instead of an Adapter, this means having to rewrite all the adapterfunctionality for my SurfaceView but it seemed to be the best way of solving this issue of very custom drawing and layout managing for my usecase.p  pIt still would be nice to build a custom Viewgroup that can handle this kind of layout problems.p

And while I am in the Conversation.xaml window and if I receive a new toast notification message from the same FromUserId who is BuddyA of current Conversation.xaml,  I just want to update the ObservableCollection Messages property of the ConversationModel by appending this new message to the list of existing messages in the chat conversation window. This is because property ConvData set method is called first when Conversation.xaml is navigated and later updating the same BuddyAs content in Conversation.xaml.cs OnNavigatedTo method has successfully updated the existing data to UI and later appended the new message also.p  pWhen I try to modify the gAllConversations in Conversation.xaml.cs when i receive the new toast notification from BuddyA and if I am already in the BuddyAs window, the UI shows new message from BuddyA if the BuddyA was already there in the gAllConversations earlier. Now while being in the conversation.xaml window for UserA if I receive a new message from UserB there is no existing chat history with userB in gAllConversation object I am loading the Conversation.xaml upon clicking the notification and this time Set property of ConvData will set nothing as there was no data  and in Conversation.xaml.cs when I try add a new entry to the collection for initiating a new conversation for ConvB I dont see the changes reflecting back in the UI because set property call would have initially set the null data. How do I fix this issue p  pAnd is there a better way of handling this whole scenario so that I can avoid writing the code in code behind of Conversation.xaml.cs . Please let me know if there is an alternative way of handling this conversations cleanly.p

Negative 2290 pI am creating a C client server rendering application. p  pThe Server runs with a small Database holding jobs and presetsp  pThe Clients probably no more than 10 access the db every 2 seconds for example to poll for job information.p  pThe render nodes write to the server DB every 2 seconds to update the render status of the jobs. p  pAll client server comms is done over a local network via WCF. Each write is only updating a row. Each read will read the whole single table of jobs. approx 30 columns and maybe upto 500 rowsp  pI am currently using LocalDB in the development with LinqtoSQL  but dont mind using connection strings, but its a bit of a pain to have to distribute the 140MB installer with the app and then install something during my installer, and have the DB file located only in a certain location.p  pI have just started looking at SQLite. It seems the perfect solution  lightweight, a single file, no installer.p  pBut how does it deal with the concurrency with potential simultaneous[ concurrent] writes and reads from my render nodesclients vs MSSQL LocalDBp  pI have previously read conflicting things about write concurrency with LocalDB so any pointers would be appreciated if SQLite would be suitable in this scenario.p

Negative 2290 pSo, basically Im reinventing the wheel by trying to make a sort of spreadsheet in flash for tracking member growth in a game.  In this one section Im adding member names to an array and then placing the names into dynamically created tiles with text fields attached to display the name.p  pI have a save button which saves the array, and if I save, close, and reopen, then I can see the members I have added.  However, I would like it to refresh the stage as soon as the array is changed to reflect the changes made update the spreadsheet.  I will also be adding and removing other tiles dynamically, but I can extrapolate the solution to this problem to all of those later.p  pHeres the code I have to add members and create the displayp  precodepublic var mainArrayArray  new Array public var i1Number  0 public var memberBoxMovieClip  new MovieClip public var MAXROWS  0 public var MAXCOLS  0  public function Tracker      MAXCOLS  mainArray.length  1     addBtn.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, addFun atchaed to button on stage     public function addFuneMouseEventvoid         mainArray[i1]  []         mainArray[i1][0]  addNameTxt.text attached to textfield on stage         i1         loadMembers      public function loadMembersvoid          var multiDimensionalArrayArray  new Array           initalize the arrays         for var row  0 row lt MAXROWS row                      var boolArrayArray  new Array              for var col  0 col lt MAXCOLS col                 boolArray.pushfalse                           multiDimensionalArray.pushboolArray                   now we can set the values of the array as usual         for var row  0 row lt MAXROWS row                      for var col  0 col lt MAXCOLS col                  multiDimensionalArray.push1                                create a column of tiles based on mainArray length with a textfield attached to each         buildLevelmultiDimensionalArray                public function buildLevelsArray             var txtArrayArray  new Array             memberBox.name  tileHolder             forvar i0 i  lt MAXROWS  1 i                 forvar o0 o lt MAXCOLS  1 o                     var currentTileMemberBox  new MemberBox                     currentTile.x  i150                     currentTile.y  o25                     currentTile.name  bo                     memberBox.addChildcurrentTile                     currentTile.gotoAndStopints[o][i]                     var memberTxtTextFieldnew TextField                      currentTile.addChildmemberTxt                     memberTxt.width  150                     memberTxt.height  25                     txtArray[o]  memberTxt                     txtArray[o].text  mainArray[o][0]                                                          memberBox.x  60                 memberBox.y  170                 addChildmemberBox                  codepre

Everything was going fine, until recently, With Literally No Code Change, the application broke, reason being some problem with the threadlocal, that fails to hold my header.

Negative 2290 pAfter RampD i didnot get solution for this flaw...p  p1 This call to mscorlibdll.System.IO.File.Delete contains a path manipulation flaw. The argument to the function is a filename constructed using usersupplied input. If an attacker is allowed to specify all or part of the filename, it may be possible to gain unauthorized access to files on the server, including those outside the webroot, that would be normally be inaccessible to end users. The level of exposure depends on the effectiveness of input validation routines, if any. The first argument to Delete contains tainted data from the variable path. The tainted data originated from an earlier call to systemwebdll.system.web.httprequest.getparamsp  p2Validate all usersupplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Negative 2290 pI have written a small implementation of a simple stack in C using a linked list.  The application works after a bit of fussing with gdb and valgrind.  However, I have noticed that valgrind reports a number of still reachable leaks at termination of the program.p  pAfter some googling, I have found that these type of leaks are not an issue and that I generally shouldnt worry about them.  Well thats great news  The only thing is, I would REALLY like to understand why valgrind sees these leaks and where they appear.

Negative 2290 pWhat are the best techniques that you  have found to debug scala code which passes around lambda bodies, anonymous class instances and things like that p  pI am convinced Scala will make me more productive once I learn it better,  but I sometimes get puzzled when I try to figure out what generated a callback or lambda body, etc. that I am invoking at particular points in the flow of my programs execution. I tried one technique which you can see below which emdoes not workem... I provide this code example so you can see what I am trying to accomplish.  p  precodedef fork[A]a gt Par[A] Par[A]     val marker   new java.util.Date.getTime   logabout to return future with marker   marker   val func  es ExecutorService gt new Future[A]      def applycb A gt Unit Unit         logapplying callback w eval in future apply method   this       evalesaescb          override def toString  String    execSvc gt future wmarker   marker      logreturning future creation func   func.toString   func      a log method that uses a simmple timestamp to help order print statements emitted in multithreaded programs,   and which deliberately slows things down  so we dont see the same time stamp repeated. cheesy, but   seems to serve its purpose def logmsg String Unit     printlnnew java.util.Date.getTime   thread   Thread.currentThread.getName     msg   for i lt 1 to 100000000            slow things down    System.out.flush  codepre  pThe method fork returns  a function F which accepts an executor service argument, and eventually submits a Future instance to the executor service. In the fork method I would to emit a marker that tells me I am making an instance of function F here, and then before I invoke the function  somewhere outside of fork  by passing it an executor service stance,  i want to print the function object instance and see the marker so I can trace things back to where F was created that is.. in some invocation of fork.  The current solution gives me the following output  p  precode1438983547813 thread pool1thread1 returning future creation func ltfunction1gt codepre  pI dont want to see the generic function1 label.. i want to see the result of my overridden toString method which will print my marker.p  pDoes anyone have any cool tricks to do this  And in general if there are blog posts or articles that discuss similar debugging tricks, I would be grateful if someone could provide some links.

Negative 2290 pLaravel 5.1 relationshipsp  pIn order to accomodate multiple types of authentication for different types of users e.g. jobseeker, recruiter, Admin, some of you have suggested using a single users table to store only the password and email, creating profile tables to store user specific information jobseekerprofile, recruiterprofile and using roles to differentiate between the different types of users i.e having a roles and roleuser table. p  pWhen defining an eloquent relationship would you define it against the users model or the profile modal e.g. recruiterprofile. p  pFor example a recruiter hasMany jobs and a job belongsTo a recruiter. If I define the relationship between the recruiterprofile modal then eloquent is unable to identify the foreign key i.e I would always have to define the foreign key everytime as the second parameter in my relationship because for belongsTo relationship eloquent uses the method name and suffixing it with id. When implementing authentication i.e. having separate profile tables like this foreign key relationship becomes convoluted for eloquent to determine.

Negative 2290 pI was called in to finish up a project that another developer had started.  Ive never worked with the WP Job Board plugin before but its mostly pretty intuitive.  The issue Im having is, there is a built in field called category and its currently set up to display a checklist in a dropdown menu.  My client would like for it to be displayed simply as a list with check boxes.p  pIn the custom fields section of the plugin, I cant delete the selection with field name of category, and I assume that having that field name is what pulls the list of categories.  I also cant create another field named category because it already exists.p  pAny thoughtsp
Negative 2290 pI am using Amazon AWS and our project uses MySQL databases. So far we are self hosting them, but we want to move that out of the instances few production workloads each running its own MySQL db and use Amazon provided ones.p  pWhat I have right now is that each server has its own mysql root password and then creates new user with new random password that is used for user.p  pMySQL state uses credentials set up in codeetcsaltminioncodep  pstrongThe problem I want to avoidstrong is having a common root password of shared DB instance that is stored in text and shared within all production instances even thought they only need to know their own.p  pthe mysql state does allow right now to manually set connection credentials for each state, meaning I can template that based on grains or pillar. That would somewhat work since I could just create each instance credentials and manually distribute them. But thats not the salt way is itp  pSo I could have an event fire to master asking to checkcreate credentials, but there is no way to respondstop state there is itp  pI cant set up a slave in mysql instance since its just an interface I am allowed to access to.p  pSo I could also salt the master and have within master configuration a state that would go over a list of minions and check credentials. Then fire it off with an event and reactor and hope that this will finish always faster than rest of the deployment. Or is there a simpler way to keep some data secret from the minion but effectively use itp

Negative 2290 pI have a python application built on MVC pattern served by a Gunicorn server using asynchronous worker class i.e. gevent. That means multiple clients requests are served simultaneously by a worker process. Every http request contains some data specific to that request like userid.

I want these values to be available globally for any code executed for this particular request. Controller on receiving the request sets these values and then any code executed for this request has access to these values. Code executing for multiple simultaneous requests should have access to their respective data values. Is it possiblep

Negative 2290 pIm using Magento CE 1.9.1.0 and Ive got a problem with one single extension. This is a slider manager plugin and when I try to open any of its configuration pages, I get logged out from admin. Ive already tried to flush all caches, restart apache and php, without success. Im storing sessions into files, which is the default configuration and Im not having any problem to log in to admin and accessing any configuration, except for this plugin pages. I cannot find any log reporting this problem, so Im quite lost at the moment. The plugin is working fine on the frontend, by the way. Any idea about the cause of this behaviorp  pEDIT I found that opening those particular links, causes Magento to assign the frontend cookie value to the adminhtml cookie thats why I lose my login. I cannot see why this would happen though do you have any suggestion for solving thisp
Negative 2290 pI have a problem in all my activities, when I press the back button it works properly, but when I press the context menu button before, nothing happens when I press back. I am talking about the phone buttons, not the toolbar icon for back navigation. Has anyone ever dealt with thisp  pEDIT No menu shows, onPrepareOptionsMenu is removed, the phone vibrates when I press back but no action. I see that if I inflate a menu, it worsk properly after the first back that closes te popup.p  pI see that this happens only if I set the toolbar with setSupportActionBartoolbarp
