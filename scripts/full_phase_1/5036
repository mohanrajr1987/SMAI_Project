Positive 5036 pI was implementing a Treebased Set in Java for a project which is mostly irrelevant to the issue, but provides context and thought it would be nice for elements to keep track of their ancestor this would be copied to each child node as it was adopted by a parent, and set whenever the root node of the tree changed I am using a Tree class that encapsulates a root Node, in case you were wondering. The desired behavior would be that as soon as the ancestor of a nodes parent changes, the child node would correspondingly change its own ancestor. This would help ensure that no cycles were introduced during adoption, as you would only need to test whether the prospective adoptee is orphaned and not the ancestor of the current node, and that would ensure that everything is kosher. To this end, a mutable encapsulation of an Element seemed like the right idea, in lieu of a pointer as I might use were I writing in C. The only downside is, if a node is ever orphaned i.e. its parent forgets it, and it forgets its parent, as well as its ancestor, all of its descendants would have to have their own ancestor values modified as well, as they would not know that this disownment occurred. Therefore, for practical reasons, I abandoned the idea of having this Ancestor reference, as it would be more trouble to implement than its benefit would merit. However, I was wondering whether there was any way to implement a hierarchically mutable reference in Java namely, any time you copy it, any change would propogate emdownem the copy chain. An example of the desired behaviorp  precodeinterface HierarchyReferenceltAgt      public A getValue  returns value     public HierarchyReferenceltAgt chainedCopy  creates a chained copy     public void mutateA val  changes the value for this, and all chained copies     public void forsake  disregard upstream changes, propogate own changes downstream   HierarchyReferenceltStringgt a  new MyHierarchyRefererenceltStringgta HierarchyReferenceltStringgt b  a.chainedCopy HierarchyReferenceltStringgt c  b.chainedCopy a.getValue  a b.getValue  a c.getValue  a b.mutateb a.getValue  a b.getValue  b c.getValue  b a.mutatec a.getValue  c b.getValue  c c.getValue  c b.forsake a.mutatea a.getValue  a b.getValue  c c.getValue  c b.mutateb a.getValue  a b.getValue  b c.getValue  b codepre  pIs this at all reasonablepossible to implementp

Positive 5036 pSay I have a class that looks like thisp  precodeclass MyAnimals public     Animal getAnimalint index         return animals.atindex      private     vectorltAnimalgt animals  codepre  pFrom what Ive learned about C so far, I think codegetAnimalcode currently returns a copy of the animal, not a reference like in Java.

Negative 5036 pI can understand this requirement for the old PPC RISC systems and even for x8664, but for the old triedandtrue x86 In this case, the stack needs to be aligned on 4 byte boundaries only. Yes, some of the MMXSSE instructions require 16byte alignments, but if that is a requirement of the callee, then it should ensure the alignments are correct. Why burden strongeverystrong caller with this extra requirement This can actually cause some drops in performance because every callsite must manage this requirement. Am I missing somethingp  pstrongUpdatestrong After some more investigation into this and some consultation with some internal colleagues, I have some theories about thisp  ol liConsistency between the PPC, x86, and x64 version of the OSli liIt seems that the GCC codegen now consistently does a sub esp,xxx and then movs the data onto the stack rather than simply doing a push instruction. This could actually be faster on some hardware.li liWhile this does complicate the call sites a little, there is very little extra overhead when using the default cdecl convention where the caller cleans up the stack.li ol  pThe issue I have with the last item, is that for calling conventions that rely on the callee cleaning the stack, the above requirements strongreallystrong uglifies the codegen. For instance, what some compiler decided to implement a faster registerbased calling style for its own internal use ie any code that isnt intended to be called from other languages or sources This stackalignment thing could negate some of the performance gains achieved by passing some parameters in registers.p  pstrongUpdatestrong So far the only real answers have been consistency, but to me thats a bit too easy of an answer. I have well over 20 years experience with the x86 architecture and if consistency, not performance, or something else concrete, is really the reason then I respectfully suggest that is a bit naive for the developers to require it. Theyre ignoring nearly three decades of tools and support.

Negative 5036 pIn my line of work Im often retrieving very specific versions of crusty ASP.NET web apps from their longforgotten repositories, making minor changes and then recompiling.p  pA major annoyance in this process is having to create a virtual directory for every web project that I need to recompile.

Negative 5036 pIm maintaining an existing website that wants a site search.  I implemented the search using the YAHOO API.  The problem is that the API is returning irrelevant results.  For example, there is a sidebar with a list of places and if a user searches for New York the top results will be for pages that do not have New York in the main content section.  I have tried adding Yahoos codeclassrobotsnocontentcode to the sidebar however that was two weeks ago and there has been no update.p  pI also tried out Googles Search API but am having the same problem.p  pThis site has mostly static content and about 50 pages total so it is very small.p  pHow can I implement a simple search that only searches the main content portions of the pagep

Negative 5036 pAs is widely known, anything related to Swing components must be done on a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbookstutorialuiswingconcurrencydispatch.htmlthe event dispatch threada. This also applies to the a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbookstutorialuiswingcomponentsmodel.htmlmodelsa behind the components, such as a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavaxswingtableTableModel.htmlTableModela. Easy enough in elementary cases, but things become pretty complicated if the model is a live view of something that must run on a separate thread because its changing quickly. For example, a live view of a stock market on a JTable. Stock markets dont usually happen on the EDT.p  pSo, what is the preferable pattern to decouple the Swing model that must be on the EDT, and a real, threadsafe model that must be updateable from anywhere, anytime One possible solution would be to actually a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsjfctscarticlesthreadsthreads3.htmlsplit the modela into two separate copies the real model plus its Swing counterpart, which is is a snapshot of the real model. Theyre then bidirectionally synchronized on the EDT every now and then. But this feels like bloat. Is this really the only viable approach, or are there any other, or more standard, ways Helpful libraries Anythingp

Negative 5036 pI have been using Rails for over 4 years so obviously I like Rails and like doing things the Rails Way and sometimes I unknowingly fall to the dark side.p  pI recently picked up Clean Code by Uncle Bob. I am on Chapter 6 and a bit confused whether we as rails developers break the very fundamental rule of OO design, i.e. Law of Demeter or encapsulation The Law of Demeter states that an object should not know the innards of another object and it should not invoke methods on objects that are returned by a method because when you do that then it suggests one object knows too much about the other object.p  pBut very often we call methods on another object from a model. For example, when we have a relationship like An order belongs to a user. Then very often we end up doing order.user.name or to prevent it from looking like a train wreck we set up a delegate to do order.name. p  ol lipIsnt that still like breaking the Law of Demeter or encapsulation pli lipThe other question is is ActiveRecord just a Data Structure or Data Transfer Object that interfaces with the databasepli lipIf yes, then dont we create a Hybrid Structure, i.e. half object and half data structure by putting our business rules in ActiveRecord Modelspli ol

Negative 5036 pThe problems im facing is when I use something like jcarousellite inside tabs. It works fine in browsers other than ie. In ie, the carousel loads fine in the active tab, but in the inactive ones it doesnt preload. Basically when you click on a previously inactive tab, it displays nothing until you click outside the tab.  p  pI have narrowed down the problem to this My tabs use a css style where the inactive tabs set the display to none. This somehow in ie causes whatever jquery that is contained within not to load before hand. If I remove this display none property, all my carousels show fine, but ofcourse so do all the tabs i.e. they are no longer hidden when inactive, instead all are shown as overlapping blocks on the page. How can I overcome this issuep

I wasnt quite sure how to look for this problem on stackoverflow so sorry if this has been asked before pp  pBasically Im in the Console environment busy reading all the rows from a table into a variable and I noticed that you can reference the results by specifing codemyobject.idcode OR codemyobject[id]code.p  pCan someone tell me if there is a specific reason for this Is one of these methods deprecated or what is the reason for thisp  pHere is a code snippit assuming all has been setp  precodemyobject  MyModel.findall myobject[1].id returns gt my value myobject[1][id]  also returns gt my value codepre  pWhich of these methods are best practice Or is it purely a notation preferencep  pThanks    p
Negative 5036 pId like to implement a data structure similar to the lookup functionality of Amazon S3.  For those of you who dont know what Im taking about, Amazon S3 stores all files at the root, but allows you to look up groups of files by common prefixes in their names, therefore replicating the power of a directory tree without the complexity of it.p  pThe catch is, both lookup and filter operations are O1 or close enough that even on very large buckets  S3s disk equivalents  both operations might as well be O1.p  pSo in short, Im looking for a data structure that functions like a hash map, with the added benefit of efficient at the very least not On filtering.  The best I can come up with is extending HashMap so that it also contains a sorted list of contents, and doing a binary search for the range that matches the prefix, and returning that set.  This seems slow to me, but I cant think of any other way to do it.p  pDoes anyone know either how Amazon does it, or a better way to implement this data structure p

Negative 5036 pI have a problem on the following situation p  pIn my Spring, Hibernate application I got a User Entity and a UserCategory Entity. The table of the user entity got a username as identifier. This indentifierfield cant be encrypted because this table is also used by an older program without the possibility to do this. p  pTo make a ManyToOne reference from UserCategory to User I need a field in the UserCategory table with the unique username of a User.

Negative 5036 pToday I faced a weird behavior using Indy 10 shipped with Delphi 2010.

ReadLongInt calls ReadBytes. Inside ReadBytes, FInputBuffer.Size is zero. There, in a loop ReadFromSource is called, and eventually execution reaches to TIdSocketListWindows.FDSelect which calls select function from WinSock2, and execution stops here, and nothing will be received from that client connection. I tried giving value to AByteCount and AReadUntilDisconnect parameters too, but it did not change the behavior.p  pIf I replace ReadStream with ReadLn, then connecting to server does not block code execution, and the data sent from client is read by server.p  pIs there anything wrong with the code Or is this a bugp  pRegardsp

Let me explain the situation and share some of my code which Im sure will be horrible since Im an amateur.p  pI created a class to take in the settings for running a process in the background.

I set that to be double buffered through some tricks I found but it didnt matter.  There was still a roughly 10 second delay before the data showed up in the datagrid.p  pI thought about it and decided I really didnt need a datagridview and replaced the control with a multiline textbox, but it didnt make a difference.

Negative 5036 pI am working on an application that is near the end of its development cycle and has mostly passed user testing. We recently realized that having flex convert dates to the clients local timezone is not desired, as all of our dates are in EST and contain no time data. Since BlazeDS sends dates in UTC, this results in the dates being converted to the day before in timezones west of EST.p  pThe best solution is to go in and refactor all dates to adjust for the timezone offset, but that is just not doable at this stage. Since all dates in our application dont care about time, I would really like to be able to intercept all Date objects that come across BlazeDS and adjust for the timezone offset. Is it possible to do this If not, are there any cross cutting solutionsp  pThanksp

Negative 5036 pIn the past, Ive written unit tests for simple CRUD operations when creating data accessrepository code that look something like thisp  precodeusingvar connection  new WhateverConnectionconnectionString      connection.Open     usingvar transaction  connection.BeginTransaction              try                      test the CRUD operation                  finally                      gets rid of any stuff created during the test             transaction.Rollback                codepre  pI was messing around with EF4 Code First today, and I realized that I have no idea how this testing scenario translates in the Entity Framework lexicon.  It seems that, if I call codeDbContext.SaveChangescode, it saves strongandstrong commits, regardless of whether or not codeAcceptAllChangescode was called.  Even using codeObjectContextcode instead of codeDbContextcode, I cant figure out how this simple test scenario can be recreated without manually cleaning up any mocktest objects created.  I did read a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb738523.aspx relnofollowthis article on MSDNa, but codeTransactionScopecode doesnt really have a codeRollbackcode type method either.  Do I use codeTransactionScopecode and never call codeCompletecode  Is there another method or manner of using DbContext andor ObjectContext in order to Rollback during unit tests  Do I need to completely readjust my thinking for TDD with EF4 Code Firstp

Negative 5036 pIve been banging my head on the keyboard for about one week now and I cant figure a proper solution for my problem. I think its more Math related than HTML Canvas... hopefully someone can point me into the right direction.p  pIm having an HTML Canvas where users can draw lines using they mouse and the very simple moveTo and lineTo functions. When the user is done I save the coords in a MongoDB. When the user hits the page later again I want to display his drawing BUT I dont want to load the entire picture with all stored coordinates at once, I want to return it in tiles for better performance by caching each tile.p  pThe tiles are 200x200 pixels fixed offsets and width, starting at 0  200 400 ....  Now, when the user draws a line from lets say 50,50xy to 250,250xy theres only one dot in each bounding box tile. I need to split the lines and calculate the start and ending points of each line in each bounding box tile. Otherwise I cant draw the image partially in tiles. It gets even more complicated when a single line crosses multiple bounding boxes tiles. For instance 100,100 xy  1234,300 xy. The lines can go from any point  to ANY direction for ANY distance.p  pOf course I looked at Bresenhams good old algorithm and it worked  partially, but it seems like the longest and most resourcehungry solution to me.p  pSo, the reason Im here is that I hope someone can point me into the right direction with perhaps another approach of calculating the startending points of my lines for each bounding box.p  pCode examples are very welcome in JavaScript or PHP. p  pThank you for reading and thinking about it p

Negative 5036 pI have a ecore metamodel which have some relationships between its classes. Some of them are containments while others not. I have created a dynamic instance that I edit with the sample reflective editor.p  pAt this point, I cant create childs from classes with a relationship different from a containment. This is, the new child option is not available in the menu, only new sibling.p  pI dont understand why. I dont want to tweak the metamodel adding containers in all the relationships as the metamodel is correct without containments. And only setting containmentcontainer to true enables the new child option in the dynamic instance.p  pHow to proceed Why this limitationp  pThank you very much.p
Negative 5036 pI use git gui on Ubuntu 10.04 gitgui version 0.12.0.64.g89d6 to manage my commits staging, unstaging, checking diffs and I like it a lot.  However it does not show any new files or directories that I have created, even though git status on the command line shows them as untracked. I have to explicitly do git add on the untracked files before I run git gui, and then they show up as staged changes.p  pDoes anybody have an idea why this is happening Or what the right way is to add untracked files from inside git gui Other comments Ive seen about git gui suggest that this is not normal behaviour but I cant find any option that might affect it.p

Negative 5036 pIm developing a java application, using a 32Bit native library which Im accessing via JNA. On MacOS X Snow Leopard its possible to pass the parameter d32 to the JVM, which causes the JVM to start in 32Bit mode. Ive got a launcher application, which sets some environment variables and then starts the main application. This is also the place where it is decided to launch the main application with the d32 switch, if the program is executed on MacOS.p  pSo heres my question Is there a similar way to solve this on Windows or Linuxp  pIt would be the best if it was possible to run the 64Bit JVM in 32Bit mode. But Im not really afraid to tell my users to install an additional 32Bit JVM, thats not the problem. The problem is, that I would have to tell my launcher application where the 32Bit JVM can be found, as the first one in the PATH variable could be the 64Bit one.p  pThanks in advance,p  paRestlessp

Negative 5036 pI have to transfer some files to a third party. We can invent the file format, but want to keep it simple, like CSV. These wont be big files  a few 10s of MB at most and there wont be many  3 files per night.p  pOur preference for the protocol is sftp. Weve done this lots in the past and we understand it well.p  pTheir preference is to do it via a web serviceSOAPhttps call.p  pThe reasons they give is reliability, mainly around knowing that theyve fully received the file.p  pI dont buy this as a killer argument. You can easily build something into your file transfer process using sftp to make sure the transfer has completed, e.g. use headersfooters in the files, or move file between directories, etc.p  pThe only other argument I can think of is that over https, ports 80443 will be open, so there might be less firewall work for our infrastructure guys.p  pCan you think of any other arguments either way on this Is there a consensus on what would be best practice herep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5036 pI would like to implement a RTE Rich Text Editor with the ability to upload images anywhere inside the text. My aim is to create an add  edit news article page, where the client can write a story with images.p  pI am good at PHP and Javascript programming, so I am looking for help about emmethodsem of implementing this. Do I create a custom button in this RTE to insert a previously uploaded image or some other way How do I display those images for the user to choose Etc.p  pBonus points forp  ul liMultiple files upload the ability for the client to just select e.g. 10 images that are relevant to this story.li liUses some method other than Flash as a default for upload.li liUses jQuery as I use it a lot.li liRTE is very lightweight. I dont care if the client has to know a few things like markdown or something similar, I just dont like bloated RTEs.li liUses new technologies, like HTML5 and  or CSS3.li ul  pLet me clarify a few things. I know a few Javascript RTEs and have also emusedem them in several CMSs. So I dont need links to these, I can Google javascript RTE myself . However, something like hakre said emisem useful as he pointed out how extensible CKEditor is, which I was not fully aware.p  pTo give an example of the answer Im looking for you can do this with CKEditor, upload images asynchronously with jqueryhtml5upload, save all uploaded image filename in a Javascript array, create a new button inside CKEditor with a custom click handler, which displays an overlay with Fancybox and you show all the images you have filenames stored in an array, user clicks an image and you insert html into the editor.br Something like that but better  or should I say accurate.p

Negative 5036 pMy application sends notifications to the customers in bulks. For example at 8am every day a backend systems generates notifications for 50K customers, and those notifications should be delivered in a reasonable time. During performance testing Ive discovered that sending a single push request to C2DM server takes about 400 millis which is far too long. I was told that a production quota may provide better performance, but will it reduce to 10 millis Besides, I need C2DM performance marks before going to production because it may affect the implementation  sending the requests from multiple threads, using asynchronous http client etc. Does anyone knows about the C2DM server benchmarks or any performancerelated server implementation guidelines p  pThanks, Artemp

Negative 5036 pI have a gridview that imports data from a remote database, this is working fine. The data populates and I can manipulate it easily enough. There seems to be issues with the spacing of the columns. They are not giving enough space for all the text to fit in one line of each cell the width of the column seems to stop at a certain point which isnt the same for every column. This also has the effect of adding a lot of extra space in each cell in which the text only does take up one line.p  pWhen i click on the edit button, all autosizing works absolutely perfectly and the text is all line up in one cell, with no forced line breaks. Once I hit cancel and go back to the standard grid view display ie. edit not clicked the sizingspace issues comes back.p  pHere is my codep  precodeltaspSqlDataSource IDcoverAllDataSource runatserver                 ConnectionStringData Sourceblah Initial Catalogblah User Idblah              Passwordblah                 SelectCommandSELECT  FROM blah                 gt                 Search by ampnbsp                 ltaspDropDownList IDddlCoverAll runatserver Width148pxgt                 ltaspDropDownListgt                 ltbr gtltbr gt                 ltdiv styleoverflowautomaxwidth650px maxheight 400px border 1px solid blackgt                     ltaspGridView IDcoverAllGV DataSourceIDcoverAllDataSource runatserver                          BorderStyleNone AllowSortingTrue                          AutoGenerateEditButtonTrue CellPadding0 DataMemberDefaultView                          ShowFooterTruegt                         ltAlternatingRowStyle BackColorFF9900 gt                         ltEditRowStyle WrapFalse gt                     ltaspGridViewgt                 ltdivgt codepre  pSo I am not entirely sure why this is happening, it is my understanding that the gridview will automatically size the column width to accommodate the specific columns largest body of text, but this does not seem to be working correctly. To make things even more confusing, sometimes the autosizing chooses to set its width based on a column header, but other times it decides to set its width based on the cell with the largest amount of text within it.p  pSuch a simple thing to get stuck on, alas I cannot resolve this and Ive spent way too much time trying to trying to build a gridview on an empty page without divs or manipulation from an external css file, etc....its probably something way too simple.p  pAnyways, if someone could guide me in the rite direction it would be rather appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 5036 pI am new to Ruby, and I am currently working with an API which is unfamiliar to me.  In order to use code completion, which helps me learn, I installed RadRails in Eclipse.  However, I am having trouble with Content Assist specifically, the Content Assist does not reveal the methods for objects in the API.p  pFor example, one of my objects, ins, represents a loaded XBRL instance document.  If I run ins.methods, the list contains all of the methods I want, including those in the API such as functions that allow me to access items in the instancep  p...br itembr itemallbr itemallgroupbyvocabbr itemallmapbr itembyvocabbr itemctxfilterbr ...br etc.p  pHowever, if I just type ins. with Content Assist enabled, it only shows options likep  pdclonebr gembr gemoriginalrequirebr JSONbr Pathnamepathbr ...br etc.brp  pwhich appear to be system options.  As a result, the Content Assist exposes exactly zero of the methods I actually want to use.  If I know the methods ahead of time and start typing them, I can get Content Assist to give them to me, eventually, by pressing CtrlSpace.  However, that requires me to know what I want ahead of time since I am using this to explore the API, that doesnt work for me.p  pDoes anyone know how to get RadRailsEclipse to show me the correct methodsp  pRegards, Mattp

Negative 5036 pIm currently using Google Maps API and Im open to try out other free map APIs to accomplish my task. p  pIn one of the projects Im working on, I need to be able to overlay multiple shape overlay layers on top of one another. My initial thought is to have the first overlay layer to use different shades of solid colors. For subsequent overlay layers, I plan to use different colorcoded patterns... ex the second overlay layer uses colorcoded stripe pattern and another overlay layer uses colorcoded checkerbox pattern.  This way, I can stack these overlay layers to represent multiple things. For the first overlay layer, Im able to create irregular shape boundaries using a hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsdocumentationjavascriptoverlays.htmlPolygons relnofollowPolygona objects and Im able to set different fill colors on the polygons depending on the associated values. p  pAfter digging around, it seems like the Polygon object in Google Maps API only accepts fill and stroke colors, and I dont seem to be able to set custom pattern on a Polygon object.

The closest things I could use is a hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsdocumentationjavascriptoverlays.htmlGroundOverlays relnofollowGroundOverlaya object but thats not going to work for me because it accepts only 2 coordinates top left and bottom right, I believe whereas I need to create custom pattern overlays on irregular shapes.p  pCan I accomplish this using Google Maps API, or any other map APIs Bing, Yahoo, etc Are there any third party APIs that allow me to integrate custom pattern overlays on Google Mapsp

These are in a section called strongememstrongemStep 3emstrongememememstrongp  pTHe spec is that if you enter a number into one of the input boxes and check the associated checkbox in Step 3, the number gets populated into the corresponding box in step 4.p  pFor instance, if i check a checkbox called chckbox1 and enter a number into chck1 in step3, that number gets populated into chckamt in step 4 as long as the checkbox next to the inputbox in step3 is checked.p  pIf a number is entered in any of the boxes in step 3 but the associated checkbox is not checked, the number doesnt get populated into the corresponding box in step4.p  pThe issue that I have so far is that if I check a box emFIRSTem before entering a number, the corresponding  box in step4 gets populated.p  pIf, however, I enter a number into a box in step3 emBEFOREem checking the associated checkbox, that number does NOT get populated into the corresponding box in step4.p  pDoes anyone know how to ensure that whether a number is entered first in step3 or a box is checked first, as long a box is checked, that number needs to get populated into the corresponding box in step4.p  pCan someone, please help.p  pI know this is complicated but I am confident gurus here can assist.p  pHere is the markup for step3 and step4.p  pThanks a lot in advancep  precode        Step 3      ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck1 runatserver Width75px Text  0 onchangecaltottotamt1,chck1,onetime1,multi1 AutoPostBack  True Ontextchanged  getAmtgtltaspTextBoxgt      ltaspCheckBox IDchckBox1 runatserver  AutoPostBack  True gtltaspTableCellgt      ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck2 runatserver Width75px Text  0 onchangecaltottotamt2,chck2,onetime2,multi2 AutoPostBack  True Ontextchanged  getAmtgtltaspTextBoxgt      ltaspCheckBox IDchckBox2 runatserver  AutoPostBack  True gtltaspTableCellgt      ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck3 runatserver Width75px Text  0 onchangecaltottotamt3,chck3,onetime3,multi3 AutoPostBack  True Ontextchanged  getAmtgtltaspTextBoxgt      ltaspCheckBox IDchckBox3 runatserver  AutoPostBack  True gtltaspTableCellgt      ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck4 runatserver Width75px Text  0 onchangecaltottotamt4,chck4,onetime4,multi4 AutoPostBack  True Ontextchanged  getAmtgtltaspTextBoxgt      ltaspCheckBox IDchckBox4 runatserver  AutoPostBack  True gtltaspTableCellgt      ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck5 runatserver Width75px Text  0 onchangecaltottotamt5,chck5,onetime5,multi5 AutoPostBack  True Ontextchanged  getAmtgtltaspTextBoxgt      ltaspCheckBox IDchckBox5 runatserver  AutoPostBack  True gtltaspTableCellgt                                                     V    Step 4   ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck1amt runatserver Width90px Text  0gtltaspTextBoxgtltaspTableCellgt   ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck2amt runatserver Width90px Text  0gtltaspTextBoxgtltaspTableCellgt   ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck3amt runatserver Width90px Text  0gtltaspTextBoxgtltaspTableCellgt   ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck4amt runatserver Width90px Text  0gtltaspTextBoxgtltaspTableCellgt   ltaspTableCellgtltaspTextBox IDchck5amt runatserver Width90px Text  0gtltaspTextBoxgtltaspTableCellgt      If chckamttext.Text ltgt 0 Then             Select Case chckded                 Case chck1                     If chckBox1.Checked Then                         chckamtbot.Text  chckamttext.Text                         chckfed.Text  fedname1.Text                     End If                 Case chck2                     If chckBox2.Checked Then                         chckamtbot.Text  chckamttext.Text                         chckfed.Text  fedname2.Text                     End If                  Case chck3                     If chckBox3.Checked Then                         chckamtbot.Text  chckamttext.Text                         chckfed.Text  fedname3.Text                     End If                  Case chck4                     If chckBox4.Checked Then                         chckamtbot.Text  chckamttext.Text                         chckfed.Text  fedname4.Text                     End If                  Case chck5                     If chckBox5.Checked Then                         chckamtbot.Text  chckamttext.Text                         chckfed.Text  fedname5.Text                     End If             End Select         ElseIf chckamttext.Text  0 And chckded ltgt  Then             chckamtbot.Text  0             chckfed.Text           End If         chckamttot.Text  CDecchck1amt.Text  CDecchck2amt.Text  CDecchck3amt.Text  CDecchck4amt.Text  CDecchck5amt.Text codepre
Negative 5036 pI need to get the codeNSIndexPathcode for a custom cell in a codeUITableViewcode. Heres the problem I send a codeNSNotificationcode from my custom cell to my codeUITableViewControllercode when codeeditingDidBegincode gets called from a codeUITextFieldcode in my custom cell. In my codeUITableViewControllercode, I resize the codeUITableViewcode when the codeUITextFieldcode began editing, and then want the table view to scroll to the Cell in which the codeUITextFieldcode is first responder. But I cant figure out how to return the codeindexPathcode of the cell where the codeUITextFieldcode is being edited. I have tried so many ways, but its still not working. One way is this in my cstomCell class i select the row using code[self setSelectedYES]code and in my TV controller then if I codeNSLogcode the row of code[self.tableV indexPathForSelectedRow]code it always returns 0 even though its always not 0.p

Negative 5036 pI think i have all the requirements to have an alive socket while the app is in background. That is to sayp  ul liMy application has voip and audio as its background modes.li liIm using PJSIP as the SIP library, which is supposed to use CFReadStreams with the Run in Background property enabledli liThe app is using TCP to establish the connection with the SIP server.li ul  pWhen the application is sent to background, it adds a background handler which sends a keepAlive message each period of time.p  pThat keepAlive seems to be working. If I check the logs in the server I can see how messages arrive even when the application is not in foreground.p  pThe problem  and the question  is, Im not receiving calls while the application is in background. p  pIt seems that the socket is still alive, if I make a call to the cell phone while the app is no in the foreground, nothing happens, but if I launch the app by myself, the call is automatically detected. p  pThanks p
Negative 5036 pThis is a really great slider but it has just one annoying fault. If I have different widths of images, the ones that are too small for the default width, are left justified. Ive tried every which way to do it with the htmlcss but its somewhere in the js I think. I even loaded the js after the images load and it still put it left justified even though they were centered for that split second before the js loaded. What seems to happen is, the js takes the smaller width image and makes it the full default width and adds whitespace to the right of it, essentially making it a full width image. I am just curious if this is customizable so that the photo is centered and whitespace is added on either side.p  pAny thoughts are appreciated, thanks for taking a look.p  precodefunction       var

Negative 5036 pI wrote a custom PreferenceDialog that includes two TimePickers, an EditText, a few CheckBoxes, and a scrollview parent.p  pEverything works fine, but when the screen orientation changes the timepickers reset to 0 while the other controls retain their state.

Negative 5036 pI have an question about architectureperformance. Im talking about a SIP server that processes multiples client requests concurrently. I suppose that each request is treated in a dedicated thread. At the end of the process, the concerned thread log request specific infos in a file. I want to optimize the last part of processing. I mean I want to know what alternatives you propose instead of logging these infos in a file. Why Because writing in a file after processing uses resources that I would use to process other arriving requests.p  pFirst, what do you think about the question And, if you think that its a true question I mean that an alternative may optimize the performances, what do you proposep  pI thought about logging the data into a queue and to use another process IN ANOTHER MACHINE that would read from the queue and write to a file.p  pThanks for your suggestionsp

The necessary files are already in your asset pipeline.             Just add  require jquery and  require jqueryujs to your appassetsjavascriptsapplication.js             If you upgraded your app from Rails 3.0 and still have jquery.js, rails.js, or jqueryujs.js in your javascripts, be sure to remove them.             If you do not want the asset pipeline enabled, you may turn it off in application.rb and rerun this generator. codepre  pOkay, nothing new. But why my destroy links still doesnt work. So I ask myself the question where are these jquery files located When I read the jquery installation instruction for another rails version, there they always tell me to copy these files jquery.js, jqueryujs.js to a specific location. Only as a Ruby 3.1 user you dont have to do this. But why I cant find these files. Are they a part of the jqueryrails gem If yes, why my destroy links still doesnt work Is this really an issue of jquery I mean if I change the helper from codelinktocode to codebuttontocode its working. So how it can be happen as long as it should be an issue of jquery It might not matter to me, but I dont want to use a form button.

Negative 5036 pI have an assignment where I have a tree where all the parent nodes contain yes or no questions and the leaf nodes contain an answer.  There are two children per parent node, a yes node and a no node.  This tree needs to be serialized and stored in a file via RandomAccessFile so that the whole tree isnt written out to the file every time.  If the leaf node doesnt contain the answer the user is looking for, the user submits a new answer and a question to differentiate between the leafs answer and the answer he was thinking of.  Then this leaf becomes a parent with its own question and two children a yes node and a no node these two nodes are new leafs.  This process is whats giving me trouble because if a leaf is already written out to the file how can I overwrite the leaf without spilling into another nodes data since the byte size of a leaf node changes when it becomes a parent.  Note that the program can be killed at any time and its tree structure should still remain intact.  Thanksp

Its main theme is exposing codeIObservableltTgtcode objects directly from the interfaces of our components.p  precode  Interfaces  interface IFooSource       this is the eventstream of objects of type Foo     IObservableltFoogt FooArrivals  get    interface IBarSource       this is the eventstream of objects of type Bar     IObservableltBargt BarArrivals  get      Implementations  class FooSource  IFooSource       Here we put logic that receives Foo objects from the network and publishes them to the FooArrivals event stream.   class FooSubsetsToBarConverter  IBarSource      IFooSource fooSource      IObservableltBargt BarArrivals              get                       Do some fancy Rx operators on fooSource.FooArrivals, like Buffer, Window, Join and others and return IObservableltBargt                  this class will subscribe to the bar source and do processing class BarsProcessor      BarsProcessorIBarSource barSource     void Subscribe      Main  class Program      public static void Mainstring[] args              var fooSource  FooSourceFactory.Create         var barsProcessor  BarsProcessorFactory.CreatefooSource  this will create FooSubsetToBarConverter and BarsProcessor          barsProcessor.Subscribe         fooSource.Run  this enters a loop of listening for Foo objects from the network and notifying about their arrival.       codepre  pThe other suggested another design that its main theme is using our own publishersubscriber interfaces and using Rx inside the implementations only when needed.p  precode interfaces   interface IPublisherltTgt      void SubscribeISubscriberltTgt subscriber   interface ISubscriberltTgt      ActionltTgt Callback  get      implementations   class FooSource  IPublisherltFoogt      public void SubscribeISubscriberltFoogt subscriber   ...          here we put logic that receives Foo objects from some source the network publishes them to the registered subscribers   class FooSubsetsToBarConverter   ISubscriberltFoogt, IPublisherltBargt      void CallbackFoo foo               here we put logic that aggregates Foo objects and publishes Bars when we have received a subset of Foos that match our criteria          maybe we use Rx here internally.           public void SubscribeISubscriberltBargt subscriber   ...      class BarsProcessor  ISubscriberltBargt      void CallbackBar bar               here we put code that processes Bar objects         program  class Program      public static void Mainstring[] args              var fooSource  fooSourceFactory.Create         var barsProcessor  barsProcessorFactory.CreatefooSource  this will create BarsProcessor and perform all the necessary subscriptions          fooSource.Run   this enters a loop of listening for Foo objects from the network and notifying about their arrival.       codepre  pWhich one do you think is better Exposing codeIObservableltTgtcode and making our components create new event streams from Rx operators, or defining our own publishersubscriber interfaces and using Rx internally if neededp  pHere are some things to consider about the designsp  ul lipIn the first design the consumer of our interfaces has the whole power of Rx at hisher fingertips and can perform any Rx operators. One of us claims this is an advantage and the other claims that this is a drawback.pli lipThe second design allows us to use any publishersubscriber architecture under the hood. The first design ties us to Rx.pli lipIf we wish to use the power of Rx, it requires more work in the second design because we need to translate the custom publishersubscriber implementation to Rx and back. It requires writing glue code for every class that wishes to do some event processing.pli ul

Negative 5036 pI was playing around out of interest with retrieving a tree of nodes in a simple adjacency list with a recursive query using local variables. p  pThe solution i have so far is fun but i wonder and this is my only question why MySQL refuses to use any codeINDEXcode to optimize this query. Shouldnt MySQL be able to lookup the nearest childs by using an codeINDEXcodep  pIm curious why MySQL doesnt.

Negative 5036 pSo, I have a keyListener in my program. As soon as its activated, it draws another component on screen.p  pWhat happens is the newest component gets drawn on screen in a place it shouldnt be or wrongly sized just for a split second and then snaps to its designated location and size and everything looks great.p  pIs there a way to instruct my program to calculate position and size of the component prior to drawing it on screen to avoid that flickerp  precodepackage core  import java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Component import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Font import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import

Then we find the total sales for the that item, and begin subtracting the receiving amount from sales. The remainder is considered aged not sold and is evaluated against the next month. We then move to the next month and repeat the process until we hit a negative number or 0. If we hit a negative number then that means we have hit a month that we ordered more than sold to date, and that amount is considered aged not sold. If there are more months to evaluate then any FURTHER received amount is considered aged by default as it clearly as not been sold.p  pHere is sample data from the table used for evaluation p  precodeID      ItemID  ItemLookupCode  HQAdjustment    FirstTransferred        Rcvd    RcvdDateEarly           RcvdDateLate            Sold    SoldDateEarly           SoldDateLate            Sales   Month   Year    StartOfMonthQty EndOfMonthQty 17350   188993  21208641        0               20120405 132914.000 48      20120427 110040.100 20120427 110040.100 40      20120405 132914.000 20120430 125013.000 75.20   4       2012    0               8 34427   188993  21208641        0               20120405 132914.000 120     20120522 101440.213 20120522 101440.213 24      20120504 174212.000 20120529 102210.000 44.72   5       2012    8               104 48437   188993  21208641        0               20120405 132914.000 0       NULL                    NULL                    12      20120602 162445.000 20120621 111505.000 22.36   6       2012    104             92 62369   188993  21208641        0               20120405 132914.000 60      20120716 125733.330 20120716 125733.330 9       20120711 144201.000 20120725 145841.000 16.22   7       2012    92              143 75781   188993  21208641        0               20120405 132914.000 0       NULL                    NULL                    2       20120801 125610.000 20120814 190100.000 4.01    8       2012    143             141 codepre  pHere is the result of my function for the above datap  precodeItemLookupCode  Month   Rcvd    Sold    Aged 21208641        4       48      40      0 21208641        5       120     24      81 21208641        6       0       12      0 21208641        7       60      9       60 21208641        8       0       2       0 codepre  pThis tells me that we sold everything received in April.

Then without selling the inventory out in July we ordered more again, and therefore that inventory is automatically considered to be aged.p  pThe purpose of this function is stop what happened above. Which is ordering items that have aged unsold inventory. Its also used for evaluating how much of a department is aged and if we should consider starting a sale to get rid of aged items.p  pThe problem is that we have no less then 40,000 items to evaluate.

Negative 5036 pIm doing an analysis about Arrays in Scala. Im doing this analysis following a book Concepts of Programming Languages by Robert W. Sebesta. According to the book, there are five categories of arrays, based on the binding to subscript ranges, the binding to storage, and from where the storage is allocated. The categories arep  ul lipstrongstatic arraystrong  is one in which the subscript ranges are statically bound and storage allocation is static done before run time. The advantage of static arrays is efficiency No dynamic allocation or deallocation is required. The disadvantage is that the storage for the array is fixed for the entire execution time of the program.pli lipstrongfixed stackdynamic arraystrong  is one in which the subscript ranges are statically bound, but the allocation is done at declaration elaboration time during execution. The advantage of fixed stackdynamic arrays over static arrays is space efficiency. A large array in one subprogram can use the same space as a large array in a different subprogram, as long as both subprograms are not active at the same time. The same is true if the two arrays are in different blocks that are not active at the same time. The disadvantage is the required allocation and deallocation time.pli lipstrongstackdynamic arraystrong  is one in which both the subscript ranges and the storage allocation are dynamically bound at elaboration time. Once the subscript ranges are bound and the storage is allocated, however, they remain fixed during the lifetime of the variable. The advantage of stackdynamic arrays over static and fixed stackdynamic arrays is flexibility. The size of an array need not be known until the array is about to be used.pli lipstrongfixed heapdynamic arraystrong  is similar to a fixed stackdynamic array, in that the subscript ranges and the storage binding are both fixed after storage is allocated. The differences are that both the subscript ranges and storage bindings are done when the user program requests them during execution, and the storage is allocated from the heap, rather than the stack. The advantage of fixed heapdynamic arrays is flexibilitythe arrays size always fits the problem. The disadvantage is allocation time from the heap, which is longer than allocation time from the stack.pli lipstrongheapdynamic arraystrong  is one in which the binding of subscript ranges and storage allocation is dynamic and can change any number of times during the arrays lifetime. The advantage of heapdynamic arrays over the others is flexibility Arrays can grow and shrink during program execution as the need for space changes. The disadvantage is that allocation and deallocation take longer and may happen many times during execution of the program. Examples of the five categories are given in the following paragraphs.pli ul  h2strongWhich of these types of matrices the Scala language is usingstrongh2

Negative 5036 pI am having a bizarre problem. I will explain a little about the architecture of the solution first. p  pWe have a mobile application on both Android and iOS that is being served by WCF RESTful web services. The web services are hosted by IIS 7 and they are a proxy to a service layer that runs as a windows service. The web services communicate with the service layer using WCF TCP binding. p  pThe service layer calls stored procedures in a SQL Server 2008 instance. We are using .NET Framework 4 and Microsoft Enterprise library version 5.0. Many of the web service call results in stored procedure calls.p  pNow, the problem. One of the web services is causing a single stored procedure to be called many times within a second for a single web service call. We have used the trace utility on SQL Server and we can see the stored procedure being called many times with the same set of parameters. This is causing huge performance problems on our web site.p  pI have no idea what is causing this. It is the same stored procedure that gets called multiple times. I have looked at the IIS logs and the devices are not calling the web service multiple times so it must be an internal bug. I have looked at the implementation of the web service and the service layer and there is no loop that would causes the stored procedure to be called multiple times. p  pI would appreciate any insight on this. I have no idea what is causing this but I suspect a bug in WCF or Enterprise library. p  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 5036 pI have a few years background with serverside MVC app development using CakePHP and a few more with vanilla PHP. Sadly I cant say the same about JS apps, although I do have experience in spicing up static pages with Mootools.p  pSo now Im trying to study clientside app building and my success so far hasnt been so great. Since the only MVC Ive touched is CakePHP, every JS MV framework seem incomprehensible at best. It doesnt help at all that Ive grown so accustomed to writing neat CakePHP and Mootools Class code that big blocks of JS code feel just disorderly.p  pIve even tried to write my own simple MVClike lib by imitating CakePHP for mostly academic use. I guess its needless to say that I havent really gotten anywhere with it.p  pSome things I realised while studying and writing my own MVCp  ul liJs is asynchronous. CakePHP works the way it does because PHP is synchronous. In JS theres an endless list of things that need to be implemented differently and about just as long list of things that can be done differently thanks to async. What are the most important differences between serverside MVCor CakePHP implementation of it and clientside MVli liI still dont quite get the concept of clientside models. In Cake they handle data validation and database connections. Client on the other hand is an unsafe environment, so clientside models can only do basic data filtering, prevalidation and default values. Am I completely wrong hereli liSome apps require a server counterpart. Should Server also be MVCli liIt seems that in clientside MV you can have multiple controllers simultaneously. Although I kind of understand that it has its uses, my knowledge at this point is so little I cant even think of a better question than What good does it doli ul  pIve also downloaded a hrefhttpaddyosmani.github.comtodomvc relnofollow titleTodoMVCTodoMVCa and tried to examine the different frameworks with little success. The main problems with it are that its only singlepageactions happen at different urls but the layout stays the same and the implementations are so different that Im having hard time even comprehending the basics, let alone finding the best suited framework for me. Also, it doesnt communicate with the server in any way, which is a huge disappointment since Id wanted to see how different frameworks do that.p  pSo, the optimal answer to this question would be a link to a book called strongClientside JavaScript MV For Dummies Who only have experience in serverside MVCstrong, which would earn you somewhere around 500 internets in addition to the regular StackOverflow rewards.p  pI would be extremely thankful for any insightful links on any of my ramblingly written questions topics. You will be rewarded with the standard 1s and as a further incentive I promise to write your nickname on a postit note and keep it on my monitor for the next month. The person with the most helpful answer of course gets an emAcceptedem and additionally may provide a picture to be printed along their nickname to be attached to my monitor.p

Negative 5036 pI am currently learning to program with unix domain sockets and I have a question about it. What is the standard way to separate message E.g. A server writes two messages and the client needs can do two reads to get the message. I guess I could define my own protocol by always appending a certain char sequence at the end of each message, but this does not seem right. The null char seems to get thrown away when writing to a socket. I would be really grateful for some clarification, especially if it comes within the next 2 hours D. p

Negative 5036 pI am new to GWT and understood the motive behind creating such good framework. However I could not understand how GWT builds the UI and shows while in development mode.p  pIt is said that while bootstrapping .nocache.js file is loaded in the browser, then this file created a hidden iframe. Then depending on browser and language settings a .cache.html file is loaded in the iframe where all application logic resides.p  pWhat I could not understand is how gwt does this in development mode hosted mode. Because .cache.html files are not available in development mode. I assume that the sdk receives a request from .nocache.js file regarding the browser details and then generates a .cache.html file for that particular browser and that is loaded in the iframe. My question is how .nocache.js file sends a request to sdk to dynamically generate a .cache.html file Or does it have something to do with hosted.html and the browser plugin How the UI and RPC code is loaded while in development mode. For nocache.js file to send a request there must be a server program Servlet listening to the request and allowing GWt to start looking for entrypoint class and start generating the UI content.p  pI could not understand how gwt will come to know about the browser settings and generate the UI Does hosted.html and browser plugin has something to do with the content generationp  pI searched using google, but all my trials went useless. Or may be I searched using wrong search keys. Could anyone please tell me or point me to a link where it is clearly explainedp

Negative 5036 pThis is what is the best practice question. p  pI have 3 tables orders, customer and address. p  precodeOrder  ID ADDRESSID   Customer  ID   Address  ID CUSTOMERID ISHIDDEN codepre  pUser can have multiple address and is free to edit them at any time. When user places an order I need to store a snapshot of his address at that time, associate it with the order and make it unavailable to the user. In other words, I want to duplicate address row which will be owned by Order table instead of Customer. This ownership needs to be somehow indicated for example with ISHIDDEN flag.p  pIs this correct approach that some data from address table is sometimes owned by a Customer table and sometimes by Order. p  pThe other solution would be replicating all columns from Address table in Order so the ownership will be explicit but I have bad feelings about duplication in schema.p
Negative 5036 pI was learning about spoofing attacks and now confused on IP and MAC addreses.

Negative 5036 pThis feels like such a noob question.p  pIm looking at a pile of Java code that manipulates an XML DOM.  The classes are the stock codeorg.w3c.dom.Documentcode and codejavax.xml.xpath.XPathcode and such that ship with JDK 7.  It has a ton of places that look like thisp  precodeString expr  fixedpaththroughthehierarchy   actual code reuses factory instances, etc XPath xpath  XPathFactory.newInstance.newXPath Node topNode  someDocumentInstance.getFirstChild Node node  Node xpath.evaluate expr, topNode, XPathConstants.NODE  NodeList children  node.getChildNodes for int i  0 i lt children.getLength i      Node child  children.itemi     if child.getNodeName.equalsIgnoreCasesomePrefixsomeTag           return child or otherwise break out of the loop       codepre  pAnd it all works.  But that loop seems a tedious effort if were already using XPath to get a node, why then iterate over that nodes children looking for a known tagp  pSo I tried to rewrite a section to fetch the child node directly.  But querying usingp  precodeString expr  fixedpaththroughthehierarchysomePrefixsomeTag codepre  pnever matches anything.  Ive tried variations like requesting codeXPathConstants.NODESETcode or code.STRINGcode, but still no results.  There should only ever be one of these nodes anyhow.p  pI feel like Im missing something supremely obvious here, but I cant figure out why the full query fails, when the queryforparent plus a manual loop through the children works.  Is XPath testing some quality of a node beyond codegetNodeNamecode when I use a query like thatp  pThe only theory Ive come up with is that it has something to do with XML namespaces, which arent used in this project.  Theres actually a call to code.setNamespaceAwarefalsecode on the DocumentBuilderFactory instance with a comment saying leave this off or everything everywhere breaks.p

Negative 5036 pI have a special situation that is outside my area of expertise, being a PHP developer and not a network administrator.p  pA client wants to do split testing between the new website I built them, and their old website built by a competitor. All traffic will be sent to the existing url a.com. I have access to the clients godaddy account for a.com, and traffic is sent via an ARecord to a server that I emdo notem have access to. The old webmaster will not do anything to help my cause, understandably.p  pThus, I believe I need to change the arecord on the domain to point to my own server. But how will I send 50 of traffic to the old server If I navigate to the IP Address on the ARecord directly the website doesnt come up, I presume because the server only knows to use the vhost if the request comes in as a.com. So, I need to change the arecord, then send traffic to this IP address requesting this server....and I need to do this for 50 of the hits I receive. Im not sure if I can do this using php header...Im not sure how to do this at all.p  pAny recommendations are welcome...Im racking my brain but cant find a solution.p

Heres the code Ive got so far, when the captcha is entered correctly everything works fine, but if its entered incorrectly the page reloads with an error message as well as showing the correct message for an invalid entry below the error.

Negative 5036 pIm currently trying to get to know the basics with the means of OpenGL. At the time I try to render a Floating Cube with a Pyramid beneath it. I want the Cube to rotate on Input which is already working and the Pyramid to stay where its supposed to be.p  pAfter figuring out the use of codePushcode and codePopMatrixcode I managed to rotate only the cube. My Problem is, that the Cube stops rotating as soon as I let go of the key.  The codeplayer.Xcode and codePlayer.Zcode arent reset at that point checked that.p  pSo my guess is that codePushMatrixcode puts some kind of standard matrix onto the stack, then rotates it and displays it.

Been working on this little project for a while and am finding Datatables to be next to useless but im being told i must use it....anyway Ive got it displaying our table from an ajax call to our SQL server.

Negative 5036 pFrom some Googling Im no bash expert by any means I was able to put together a bash script that allows me to run a test suite and output a status bar at the bottom while it runs. It typically takes about 10 hours, and the status bar tells me how many tests passed and how many failed.p  pIt works great sometimes, however occasionally I will run into an infinite loop, which is bad mmmkay.

Heres an example error that repeats with four lines of whitespace between each setp  precodewarning caused by MYCustomPerlModuleTESTFUNCTION print on closed filehandle GEN3663 at someCPANPerlModule.pm line 123. codepre  pIve tried taking out the code2gtamp1code redirect, and Ive tried changing codewhile IFSread r linecode to codewhile read r linecode, but I keep getting the infinite loop. Whats stranger is this seems to happen most of the time, but there have been times I finish the long test suite without any problems.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe reason Im writing this is to upgrade from a black amp white test suite to a colorcoded test suite hence the ANSI codes. Previously, I would run the test suite usingp  precoderuntestsuite gt out.txt 2gtamp1 amp watch grep c FAILED out.txt grep c passed out.txt tail 20 out.txt codepre  pRunning it this way gets the same warning from Perl, but prints it to the file and moves on, rather than getting stuck in an infinite loop. Using watch, also prints stuff like code[32mcode rather than actually rendering the text as green.p

Negative 5036 pI am relatively new to Python but am using it to hack together some automation. I am having a bit of trouble with Classes and how functions within speak to functions outside.

I have a super class codeAppWindowwx.Framecode and within it there are many functions defined.p  pcodeInitUIcode creates the interface and initializes variables. codeProcessComputerscode reaches out to different workstations to gather some info. This relies heavily on a module I had written when this application was consolebased. There are various other misc. functions that arent really worth calling out.p  pThis obviously is bad for the GUI since everything is dependent on those processes completing before the screen can refresh and accept events.p  pSince codeProcessComputercode is already separate from my UI functions, I am wondering what is the easiest way to move these functions into a separate thread, without having to rewrite and rename objects and variablesp  pI have tried creating a new class as suggested a hrefhttpwiki.wxpython.orgNonBlocking20Gui relnofollowherea. The problem is when I created the two new classes, and move the guts of codeProcessComputercode to the CountEvent class, everything broke. I could no longer update a self.textField from codeAppWindowcode nor could I refer to it using AppWindow.textField. None of my variables were accessible to the new class. Is there a better way of moving this function into its own class, without rewriting too much of the code that is currently workingp  pIf not, what is the best way of rewriting the guts of codeProcessComputercode so they still play with the rest of the code within codeAppWindowcodep

Negative 5036 pI have a for loop that I would like to make parallel, however the threads must share an codeunorderedmapcode and a codevectorcode.p  pBecause the for loop is somewhat big I will post here a concise overview of it so that I can make my main problem clear. Please read the comments.p  precode   unorderedmapltstring, vectorltintgtgt sharedUM            here I call a function that updates the unorderedmap with some       initial data, however the unorderedmap will need to be updated by       the threads inside the for loop         vectorltintgt sharedVector          the shared vector initially is empty, the threads will      fill it with integers, the order of these integers should be in ascending     order, however I can simply sort the array after all the      threads finish executing so I guess we can assume that the order      does not matter        pragma omp parallel for    forint i0 iltN i        key  generateakeyvalueaccordingtoanalgorithm       stdunorderedmapltstring, vectorltintgtiterator it  sharedUM.findkey                according to the data inside itgtsecondthe value,         the thread makes some conclusions which then        uses in order to figure out whether         it should run a high complexity algorithm        or not.               bool conclusion  makeconclusion         ifconclusion  true             results  runexpensivealgorithm                          According to the results,               the thread updates some values of              the key that it previously searched for inside the unorderedmap              this update may help other threads avoid running               the expensive algorithm                             sharedVector.pushbacki      codepre  pInitially I left the code as it is, so I just used that codepragmacode over the for loop, however I got a few problems regarding the update of the codesharedVectorcode. So I decided to use simple locks in order to force a thread acquire the lock before writing to the vector. So in my implementation I had something like thisp  precode      omplockt sharedVectorLock       ompinitlockampsharedVectorLock       ...       for...       ...        ompsetlockampsharedVectorLock        sharedVector.pushbacki        ompunsetlockampsharedVectorLock       ...       ompdestroylockampsharedVectorLock codepre  pI had run my application many times and everything seemed to be working great, and thats until I decided to rerun it automatically too many times until I got wrong results. Because Im very new to the world of OpenMP and the threads in general, I wasnt aware of the fact that we should lock all the readers when a writer is updating some shared data. As you can see here in my application the threads always read some data from the codeunorderedmapcode in order make some conclusions and learn things about the key that was assigned to them. What happens though if two threads have to work with the same key, and while some other thread is trying to read the values of this key, another one has reached the point of updating those values I believe thats where my problem occurs.p  pHowever my main problem right now is that Im not sure what would be the best way to avoid such things from happening. Its like my system works for 99 of the time, but that 1 ruins everything because two threads are rarely assigned with the same key which in turn is because my unorderedmap is usually big.p  pWould locking the unorderedmap do my job Most likely, but that wouldnt be efficient because a thread codeAcode that wants to work with the key codexcode would have to wait for a thread codeBcode that is already working with the key codeycode where codeycode can be different than codexcode to finish. p  pSo my main question is, how should I approach this problem How can I lock the codeunorderedmapcode if and only if two threads are working with the same keyp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 5036 pIm building off of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14613584canaclienteverreliablygenerateapkforanobjectbeingwrittentoadba previous discussion I had with Jon Skeeta.p  pThe gist of my scenario is as followsp  ul liClient application has the ability to create new PlaylistItem objects which need to be persisted in a database.li liUse case requires the PlaylistItem to be created in such a way that the client does not have to wait on a response from the server before displaying the PlaylistItem.li liClient generates a UUID for PlaylistItem, shows the PlaylistItem in the client and then issue a save command to the server.li ul  pAt this point, I understand that it would be bad practice to use the UUID generated by the client as the objects PK in my database. The reason for this is that a malicious user could modify the generated UUID and force PK collisions on my DB.p  pTo mitigate any damages which would be incurred from forcing a PK collision on PlaylistItem, I chose to define the PK as a composite of two IDs  the clientgenerated UUID and a servergenerated GUID. The servergenerated GUID is the PlaylistItems Playlists ID.p  pNow, I have been using this solution for a while, but I dont understand whybelieve my solution is any better than simply trusting the client ID. If the user is able to force a PK collison with another users PlaylistItem objects then I think I should assume they could also provide that users PlaylistId. They could still force collisons.p  pSo... yeah. Whats the proper way of doing something like this Allow the client to create a UUID, server gives a thumbs updown when successfully saved. If a collision is found, revert the client changes and notify of collison detected p

Negative 5036 pI use ZXing to read barcodes in my application. When a button is pressed, I launch the program with the following code.p  precodeIntent scanner  new Intentcom.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN scanner.putExtraSCANMODE, ONEDMODE startActivityForResultscanner, 0 codepre  pWith this I can read one barcode. Then the reader closes and returns to my application. I use the codeonActivityResultcode method to retrieve the barcode. Can I somehow scan multiple barcodes without ZXing closing I want my program to process the code whenever the scanner returns something but I dont want the scanner to close. This way I can save a lot of time when scanning a lot of barcodes. It takes a few seconds for the intent to open and close, so its a long time in total when I have a thousand barcodes to scan.p

Since the count gets reset every time I close the workbook, it would not run properly when I go and run it in the 2nd month.p  pHere is the link of my original post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17057384needassistancewithexcelmacrovbaExcelMacro Help LngCntap  pHere is a part of the code for 2 of the 4 sectionsp  precode    ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1  SUMIFWorksheet1R5C1R159C1,RC1,Worksheet1R5C amp 13  LngCnt amp R159C amp 13  LngCnt amp  LngCnt  LngCnt  1 RangeB13.Select Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeB13B17, TypexlFillDefault RangeB13B17.Select RangeB23.Select  ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1       SUMIFWorksheet2R3C6R47C6,RC1,Worksheet2R3C amp 16  LngCnt amp R47C amp 16  LngCnt amp  LngCnt  LngCnt  2 RangeB23.Select Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeB23B32, TypexlFillDefault RangeB23B32.Select codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  precodegt Public LngCnt As Long Sub Actual   Actual Macro  LngCount  ActiveWorkbook.Namesstate.Value      ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1  SUMIFWorkbook1R5C1R159C1,RC1,Workbook1R5C amp 13  LngCnt amp R159C amp 13  LngCnt amp      LngCnt  LngCnt  1     RangeB13.Select     Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeB13B17, TypexlFillDefault     RangeB13B17.Select ActiveWorkbook.Namesstate.Value  LngCnt End Sub codepre
Negative 5036 pI have a SeleniumThucydides project that runs test cases using JUnit. In Eclipse when running using JUnit I can use codeFixMethodOrdercode to run tests in alphabetical order. This works fine, but when I then run the test in Maven using codemvn verifycode the tests are run randomly.p  pI have seen that you can set codeltrunOrdergtalphabeticalltrunOrdergtcode in the pom.xml but it doesnt seem to work either.p  pAre there anyway to run the tests alphabetically when using Maven I know they shouldnt be dependent on each other but some are at this point in time, so need this

Negative 5036 pI am trying to work with Chaco and pyqt in plotting a realtime data acquisition task for laboratory hardware.

Negative 5036 pI recently downloaded Microsoft Visual C 2010 Express to try to learn C and I am running in to a problem. I have used Eclipse before with Java and Microsoft Visual C seems similar to it. p  pSo my problem is that I create a project called Project and I have two files HelloWorld.cpp and PowersOfTwo.cpp in the project. The HelloWorld.cpps code is below   p  precode   Hello World File   include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  int main      coutltlt Hello, World ltlt endl      return 0   codepre  pThe PowersOfTwo.cpp code is belowp  precode     This program generates the powers of two until the number that the user requested   include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  int raiseToPowerint n, int k  int main      int limit     cout ltlt This program lists the powers of two.  ltlt endl     cout ltlt Enter exponent limit      cin gtgt limit      for int i  0 i lt limit i              cout ltlt 2 to the  ltlt i ltlt    ltlt raiseToPower2, i ltlt endl           return 0    Function for raiseToPower   int raiseToPowerint n, int k      int result  1     for int i  0 i lt k i              result  n          return result   codepre  pBasically, I tried to start without debugging the PowersOfTwo.cpp file but I end up with a fatal error stating that main is already defined in the HelloWorld.obj. Does that mean I cannot have two files with a main method in the same project as opposed to eclipse when I could have two files with a main method. Does that also mean that I have to create a new project every time for an unrelated program to workp

Negative 5036 pI tried using CExpress, maybe its just my lack of knowledge on how to use it but I cannot seem to open this .db2 database I have on my PC. If someone could explain to me what application and what steps I need to take to completely view the database it would be much appreciatedp
Negative 5036 pI have a lambda expression here with the goal of returning all people in our database that either have First Name, Last Name, Registration Number or Phone Numbers that match the search input given by the user. For some reason, when trying to do this search I get a long cryptic NHibernate error at the bottom. It only happens if that phone number search is included in my code, the other searches work fine, and the phone number search works fine on its own. Phone Numbers is an IList of Phone and their Number is a string. Any advice or possibly a better way to handle this search based off a string Thanks.p  precodex gt                             x.Person.FirstName.StartsWithsearchInput

If I have this excel workbook open it takes minutes and I havent even bothered to let it run to the end when there are more workbooks open.p  pIm very new to VBA, but Id expect it to be a bit faster if I could set it to solve the equations in VBA instead of letting the values iterate back and forth between the excel worksheet and the VBA solver, by gradually solving the cell values  if I just knew how, IF it is possible or a good idea.p  pThe code in its entity, first the general calculationsp  precode   Sub BFgas  Datamatrix  RangeCells.FindDatamatrix.Offset1, 0.Address, Cells.FindDatamatrix.Offset21, 0.Address ReDim BFoutput1 To 168, 1 To 3 As Double    MpigironMatrix  RangeCells.FindBF1 Pig iron production.Offset1, 0.Address, Cells.FindBF1 Pig iron production.Offset168  1, 0.Address BfblastMatrix  RangeCells.FindBF 1  Blast.Offset1, 0.Address, Cells.FindBF 1  Blast.Offset168  1, 0.Address BfoxygenMatrix  RangeCells.FindBF 1  Oxygen.Offset1, 0.Address, Cells.FindBF 1  Oxygen.Offset168  1, 0.Address  M  1 Do  Mpigiron  MpigironMatrixM, 1 Tons of pig iron Bfblast  BfblastMatrixM, 1 Nm3 Bfoxygen  BfoxygenMatrixM, 1 Nm3  If Bfblast  0 Or Bfoxygen  0 Then Do Mpigiron  MpigironMatrixM, 1 Tons of pig iron Bfblast  BfblastMatrixM, 1 Nm3 Bfoxygen  BfoxygenMatrixM, 1 Nm3 M  M  1 Loop While Bfoxygen  0 Or Bfblast  0 End If    nN2blast  Bfblast  Datamatrix19, 1  Datamatrix17, 1 kmol nO2blast  Bfblast  Datamatrix18, 1  Datamatrix17, 1 kmol nO2oxygenintake  Bfoxygen  Datamatrix17, 1 kmol ntotalOin  nO2blast  nO2oxygenintake  2 kmol     Calculates the amounts of coke, briquettes and scrap  Cokeratio  Cells.FindInput data.Offset1, 1.Value2 Briqratio  Cells.FindInput data.Offset2, 1.Value2 Scrapratio  Cells.FindInput data.Offset3, 1.Value2 moil  Cells.FindInput data.Offset4, 1.Value2   mcoke  Cokeratio  Mpigiron  1000 kg mbriq  Briqratio  Mpigiron kg mscrap  Scrapratio  Mpigiron kg   FeIron calculations Calculates the molar masses of iron and coal in pig iron, briqettes and scrap  nFepigiron  Datamatrix3, 1  Mpigiron  1000  Datamatrix15, 1 kmol  nFebriq  Datamatrix12, 1  mbriq  Datamatrix15, 1 kmol  nFescrap  Datamatrix13, 1  mscrap  Datamatrix15, 1 kmol  Calculates how many kmol is needed from pellets  nFepellets  nFepigiron  nFebriq  nFescrap mpellets  nFepellets  Datamatrix11, 1  Datamatrix15, 1 Divides by the iron content 0.72, to get the total mass    OOxygen calculations Calculates the total incoming oxygen mpelxpellets,O  mbriqxO,briqMO  nblast,O22  nOxygen,O22  Oxygenin  mpellets  Datamatrix10, 1  Datamatrix16, 1  mbriq  Datamatrix9, 1  Datamatrix16, 1  ntotalOin kmol Cells.FindSolutions.Offset0, 1.Value  Oxygenin  CCoal calculations Calculates the incoming coal minus what comes out with the pig iron, leaving what comes out with the bfgases mcoke,xC,coke  moilxC,oil  mbrxbr,C  mrjxC,rj  Vtgy,co  y,co2  Coalforbfgas  mcoke  Datamatrix4, 1  Datamatrix14, 1  moil  Datamatrix5, 1  Datamatrix14, 1  mbriq  Datamatrix6, 1  Datamatrix14, 1  Mpigiron  1000  Datamatrix1, 1  Datamatrix14, 1 Cells.FindSolutions.Offset0, 2.Value  Coalforbfgas  NNitrogen Nitrogen is mainly what comes in with the blast  N2forbfgas  nN2blast Cells.FindSolutions.Offset0, 3.Value  N2forbfgas    Sets in the hydrogen just in case Hhydrogen Hforbfgas  mcoke  Datamatrix21, 1  Datamatrix20, 1  moil  Datamatrix7, 1  Datamatrix20, 1 codepre  pThe solver partp  precodeSolverReset Code solves the problem for a specific set of lines, in this case meaning hours SolverOptions Precision1, Iterations100, AssumeNonNegTrue SolverOk setCellCells.FindDifferences.Offset1, 0.Address, MaxMinVal3, ValueOf0, ByChangeRangeCells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 1.Address, Cells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 3.Address  SolverAdd cellRefRangeCells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 2.Address, Cells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 3.Address,  relation3,  formulaText0.1  SolverAdd cellRefRangeCells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 2.Address, Cells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 3.Address,  relation1,  formulaText0.4  SolverAdd cellRefCells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 1.Address,  relation3,  formulaTextBfblast  Bfoxygen  1.2  SolverAdd cellRefCells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 1.Address,  relation1,  formulaTextBfblast  Bfoxygen  2  SolverSolve userFinishTrue  BFoutputM, 1  Cells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 1.Value BFoutputM, 2  Cells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 2.Value BFoutputM, 3  Cells.FindTesting here.Offset0, 3.Value    M  M  1 Loop While M lt 169  Cells.FindBF1  Output data.Offset2, 0.ResizeUBoundBFoutput, 1, 3.Value  BFoutput codepre

The class files are loaded by native code and are extracted from a custom archive format and loaded using a custom class loader. I can however execute Java code in the context of their JVM instance fairly easily.p  pMy goal is to do something like belowp  pFor example, say in there code there is a classp  precodeclass Theirs       public Theirs          ....           public String getName          return Theirs       codepre  pAnd in my code I havep  precodeclass Mine       public static Theirs theirs  null     public static void myMethodTheirs theirs           theirs  theirs       codepre  pI would like to modify emeveryem instance of Theirs to behave as suchp  precodeclass Theirs       public Theirs          Mine.myMethodthis       codepre  pSo that I can then do something likep  precodeSystem.out.printlnMine.theirs.getName codepre  pI thought that CGLib Proxies would enable this, but with Proxies, the overhead is high due to string comparisons for methods that may be called hundreds thousands of times a second and anyways, I discovered that in order to have an instance of an enhanced object, you need to instantiate them yourself.. IE not all instances of the class you enhanced are actually enhanced such asp  precodepublic static void main String[] args       Object proxy  Enhancer.createObject.class, new HashCodeAlwaysZeroMethodInterceptor     System.out.printlnnew Object.hashCode     System.out.printlnproxy.hashCode   codepre  pThe first println prints a real objects hash, not 0 as intended.p  pSo now I am thinking that what I need to do is write my own or modify theirs ClassLoader that looks for the classes I am interested in modifying, inject my modifications and go from there using something like ASM. Ive done something similar using JVMTI and C, but the compiledebug process for that is extremely time consumingp  pBefore I do that however, I was hoping that there was something that worked similar to how CGLib proxies work, in that the library takes care of the required bytecode modifications, but that doesnt require me to actually instantiate an instance of said enhanced class.p

If I remove this buffer size it hangs, however with the 5 byte size it only hangs on the last pass through the loopp  precodestreamsettimeoutthisgtsocket, 10 10 seconds read timeout  while feofthisgtsocket      breakOut  false      echo Reading response.time.ltbrgt     data  streamgetcontentsthisgtsocket, 5     echo Read response.time.ltbrgt      if data  false          thisgtlatestErrStr  Timed out waiting for a response.         return false      else          index  strposdata, chr3          if index  FALSE             breakOut  true             data  substrdata, 0, index                   response . data           streammetadata  streamgetmetadatathisgtsocket      If we have no EOF marker then break if there are no bytes left to read     ifbreakOut  streammetadata[unreadbytes] lt 0          break       codepre  pThe output is as followsp  precodeReading response1387463602 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463603 Reading response1387463603 Read response1387463623 codepre  pAs you can see there is a 10s delay between the last two lines, but no noticeable delay between the others.p  pAlso for your information I use an ETX marker 3 to signify the end of a message, so I also stop if I hit this rather than just the end of the stream.p  pAm I doing something wrong Is there a better way of doing thisp  pThanks in advance...p  pEdit Just to be clear, the above code is only expecting one message response. It does not care about any data that comes back after it has received an ETX byte.p  pEdit2 Hangs have been seen of up to 40 seconds now. It doesnt appear to be fixed to 10 seconds, but it weirdly seems to be nice round numbers every time.p  pstrongSolutionstrong thanks to chathuxstrongstrongp  pcodestreamgetcontentsstream, bytescode will block until it receives codebytescode bytes or the timeout expires. This means my code was reaching the end and trying to read 5 bytes which didnt exist, it was therefore waiting 10s before giving up.p  pAs I know the minimum size of a message coming back to me is 49 bytes, I first read those 49 bytes blocking until I get them or 10s expires in order to populate the codestreamgetmetadatacodes codeunreadbytescode field. Once I have this I dynamically adjust the buffer size to codemin161024, unreadbytescode so I either read 16k at a time or all of the remaining bytes, whichever is smaller. In my case this usually only means two goes through the loop as messages are often tiny 49 bytes  payload.p  pThe system now hangs for approximately 3 seconds instead of 10, but it hangs waiting for the initial few bytes to arrive rather than at the end which can be put down to network latency and other normal factors.p

Negative 5036 pI am trying to migrate a solution using pointers to one using uniqueptr, to simplify resource handling. I am aware of move semantics and the the use of codestdmovecode to work with uniqueptrs. p  pPresently I have a function with the signature codeint fooconst T2DMatrix mcode and I call this using a dynamically allocated 2DMatrix object. The function codefoocode requires only readonly access to T2DMatrix class, hence the const argument. Now, Ive migrated this to codeint foouniqueptrltconst T2DMatrixgtamp mcode. From a different function, codeprocesscode, which has a codeuniqueptrltT2DMatrixgtcode object created using a factory function, I want to pass the object to foo as the parameter. However, the compiler doesnt allow me to do so. Please note, I do not want to transfer ownership of the object from codeprocesscode to codefoocode, hence the use of references. Calling foo with a codeuniqueptrltconst T2DMatrixgtcode works fine, however the const guarantee would not be enforced if I change the function signature.p  pNote one solution Ive found is to create a new codeuniqueptrltconst T2DMatrixgtcode object in process, transfer ownership to it from the original codeuniqueptrltT2DMatrixgtcode object using codestdmovecode, pass it to foo, and again transfer ownership in process. But this hardly seems the ideal solution.p  pPlease suggest the equivalent of the pointer solution which was allowing me to pass a T2DMatrix argument to const T2DMatrix parameter. I tried using msvc2012, msvc2013 and g4.8, all with the same results.p
Negative 5036 pIve been playing around with this problem, trying to sort out this multidimensional array but I keep on getting the wrong output. The array is sorted, except for the first element.

Negative 5036 pI have been asking myself for quite a while, when exactly objects and variables go out of scope and are garbage collected. Also what the difference between reference and value types is in this regard.p  pFor example if I usep  precodePrivate Sub Foo   Dim ob as Integer  1 End Sub codepre  pit is my understanding that the variable goes out of scope when the Sub has run its course and the related memory is freed again.

However I can do the followingp  precodePrivate Sub Foo   Dim frm1 as New Form1   frm1.Show               Edit made here End Sub codepre  pand the related form is opened stays open even though the sub is over immediately. Therefore there seem to be references that are kept open somehow, so the new form instance is not disposed of. Maybe there is something special about forms. But what about some other random objectp  precodePrivate Sub Foo   Dim ob as New MyRandomClass End Sub codepre  pWill this object persist like the form or is it disposed p  pCould someone shed some light about the details of scope and the differences between variables, objects and maybe Forms which are not really straightforward in VB.net compared to C in my opinion.p

It feels awfully magical.p  pThe Python docs just liken lambdas to anonymous functions and dont really talk about the underthehood that I can tell  so what exactly is going on when defining and using lambdas p  pSidequestion is this fair game for an approach to pubsubbing, then, or is the convenience and apparent ubiquity of weakrefs the whole reason we tend to see those instead as opposed to, say, codetryexceptcodeing your way through lambdas that no longer return valid functions or bound methodsp

Since some calls to the API return many values thatre pretty consistent we want to cache them in a local database.p  pCurrently we use a TPT database mapping, but this is much slower than TPH.

Negative 5036 pI have written an MPI code in C for my Raspberry Pi cluster, which generates an image of the Mandelbrot Set. What happens is on each node excluding the master, processor 0 part of the Mandelbrot Set is calculated, resulting in each node having a 2D array of ints that indicates whether each xy point is in the set.p  pIt appears to work well on each node individually, but when all the arrays are gathered to the master using this command MPIGatherampinside, 1, MPIINT, insideFull, 1, MPIINT, 0, MPICOMMWORLD it corrupts the data, and the result is an array full of garbage. inside is the nodes 2D arrays of part of the set. insideFull is also a 2D array but it holds the whole set Why would it be doing thisp  pThis led to me wondering if it corrupting because the master isnt sending its array to itself or at least I dont want it to.

Negative 5036 pI have a large application in Magento which is pretty heavy in terms of data collections and actions that are performed. Currently Im trying to optimize the performance and I noticed that during a regular page load, around 900 MagegetModel calls are being performed. The call itself is quite fast but when 900 calls are made, this affect performance as all the calls take around 2 seconds.p  pI was wondering if its safe to use Magentos registry functionality to register models that have no construct arguments. Basically if a MagegetModelsalesquote is called, after loading the class I intend to register the instance under a unique key like modelregister.className and all subsequent MagegetModelsalesquote calls will no longer create a new instance of the model but return the one in the registry, which should improve performance. This, of course, would only be used for calls that have no constructArguments in the MagegetModel call.p  pHas anyone done this before As I am interested if this approach is safe or if this might cause other issues.p

Negative 5036 pI have a dynamic part of my website that shows a table if there are values and hides the table if there are no values. When it shows the table, the values in the table are in different colors that represent different definitions. I want to be able to add hover text with a color key for these definitions.  Originally, I wanted a hover to have a little square of that color with the definition next to the color. I thought that might be too difficult after looking around, so Ive resorted to just trying to change the actual color of the definition in order to show the link between the valuecolordefinition . However...I cant even figure out how to do that. i need the hover to occur on mouseover, so right now i have this until I figure out how to get colors  change the color text IN the hover paragraph p  precodemyResults.find.Solutions.bindmouseover, function  .myTable.attrtitle, blue  value1 n red  value2 n olive  value3 n  codepre  pI tried using tooltipster and couldnt get that to work. p
Negative 5036 pUnder Linux, are there ways to add comments, description text, rich text, hypertext ..  to a directory emitselfem, rather than by means of auxiliary files eminem such a directory, like README.txt, INSTALL.txt, NOTEONWHYWEDIDTHISTHISWAY.txt, .. p  pIn such a generalized directory, a directory entry subdirectoryfile would be represented as hyperlink, at least in one view of such a generalized directory. A classical directory view may also be available for generalized directories, in which the commments, description, mentioned above, would be omitted, or be available through an auxiliary file. I am aware this may require either special formatting of the storage medium, or a software layer on top of a classical disk formatting structure. The views would have to be derived from the generalized directory and not vice versa in order to avoid consistency problems between the views. p

Negative 5036 pI am trying to do an old project of my school, which deals with metaprogramming in C98.

Negative 5036 pIm using blueimp file upload angularjs version and have mostly got it working. The only area Im having an issue with is parsing of the json response. p  pAs recommended by angularjs team here  a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgapingservice relnofollowhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgapingserviceahttp  all server responses of type applicationjson are prefixed with ],n and angularjs is smart enough to strip it.p  pIm wondering where in blueimp I can interceptpreprocess the response to strip the prefix as it isnt happening by default and causes a json parse error.p  pI have a spring mvc app with MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter class handling the response for all applicationjson types and cannot disable for specific requests as far as I can tell.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 5036 pMy application has some privileged information, costs that certain users arent allowed to see. The app uses WebAPI OData to pull data down into an AngularJS single page application which then hides or shows the data.p  pObviously this isnt ideal, any technically savvy users can just inspect the network traffic and then view the costs.p  pIs there a way to remove this data from the entity framework query at the source before its even entered my BLService layersp  pI thought projection might help but it will break the .Include functionality and that will break my OData extend functionality. Im not using code first at the moment but would be willing to switch if it will help.p  pI fear my best option would be to ditch OData and remove the data myself at the BL or web service boundary.p  pThanksp

Negative 5036 pIm working with MEF to compose a large set of plugins and observed a rather strange exception, stating that GetExportedValue could not be called before Imports for xxx are satisfied. Weird thing is that the constructor for the said part has already been executed, but imports are not satisfied, because construction of next part is needed before, which again references the first part. So its a cyclic dependency  MEF usually has no problem which this kind of dependency, but in certain scenarios this excepton happens.p  pIt mostly happens when using AssemblyCatalog togather with AggregateCatalog. But the problem lies not within the catalogs, but within the order of the discovered parts. If I use a TypeCatalog the same exception happens, but if I order the types in a certain way in the constructor of the catalog the composition does happen without error. For me this seems to be a bug in the composition algorithm. As this problem is rather difficult I wrote a demo application causing the exception a hrefhttpwww.filedropper.commeftest relnofollowhttpwww.filedropper.commeftesta p  pThe problematic import is in WorkflowController.cs  if you comment out the IdleParts import and comment in the pendant code in SolTest.cs the composition is happy.p  pI know that cyclic dependencies are bad and everything, but you cant avoid them everytime. So please no discussion about that. However, the MEF engine is able to solve the problem in principle, just in certain situations it fails, which seems to be a bug. Could anybody confirmp

I have spent about 6 hours now on the google search to see whats out there, tweaking my code, and retesting and so now Im looking for how this can be done.

Negative 5036 pIm fixing to use sockets to stream a sequence of bytes across a network. Im using a binaryformatter to serialize the objects I wish to send, then just beam them between machines and deserialize them when the reach their destination. The question has been asked before how do I detect the end of a bytestream, but my predicament is a little different. I want to be able to send multiple types of objects across this network. I would simply use a marker or agreed upon sequence of bytes to communicate the end of a message, but because I have no idea what the binaryformatter will produce, I dont know what sequence of characters I could use that would be unique. If i decided to use the sequence 255, 128, 0, 255 to denote the end of one object stream, how do I ensure that that sequence doesnt also occur within the binaryformatter output What else can I do to signify the end of one object and the beginning of anotherp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 5036 pI am having an issue with trying to bind a codeComboBoxcode in WinRT.  I am using PrismMVVM.  I am able to bind the codeItemsSourcecode to an codeObservableCollectioncode no problem, and the codeComboBoxcode is being populated.p  pWhat I am having trouble with, is having it automatically select the appropriate value based on the current codeInvoicecode.  Here is the relevant XAMLp  precodeltComboBox Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 Height30            ItemsSourceBinding PathPayees           DisplayMemberPathAccountName           SelectedValuePathPayeeId           SelectedValueBinding CurrentInvoice.PayeeId, ModeTwoWay           Margin5,0,10,0 gt codepre  pcodePayeescode is my codeObservableCollectioncode and codeCurrentInvoicecode is a property on the codeViewModelcode that points to the currently loaded codeInvoicecode item.  The codeInvoicecode has a property called codePayeeIdcode, which as you may guess, is the codeIdcode of the codePayeecode that this codeInvoicecode is associated to.p  pFor some reason, no matter which codeInvoicecode I select, the codeComboBoxcode is blank when I navigate to my page.  By blank, I just mean there is nothing selected, but it is populated with the codePayeescode collection.p  pIf I manually change the selection, and save my codeInvoicecode, the codePayeeIdcode isnt changed.  I think that it probably has something to do with the binding on the codeSelectedValuecode, but so far I have been unable to figure this one out.  Thanks in advance for any helpp  pHere are the properties for the codePayeescode and codeCurrentInvoicecodep  precodeprivate Invoice currentInvoice public Invoice CurrentInvoice      get  return currentInvoice      set  SetPropertyref currentInvoice, value     private ObservableCollectionltPayeegt payees public ObservableCollectionltPayeegt Payees      get  return payees      set  SetPropertyref payees, value   codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have added a property on the codeViewModelcode called codeSelectedPayeecode that is bound to the codeSelectedItemcode property of the codeComboBoxcode.  Here is the updated definitionp  precodeltComboBox Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 Height30            ItemsSourceBinding PathPayees           DisplayMemberPathAccountName           SelectedValuePathId           SelectedItemBinding PathSelectedPayee, ModeTwoWay           Margin5,0,10,0 gt codepre  pWhen I select a codePayeecode and save, it saves with the new codePayeeIdcode, but when I load the page it still does not load with the codeSelectedPayeecode displayed in the codeComboBoxcode.  However, all is well in the designer.  To further test, I have added a codeTextBoxcode that is bound to codeSelectedPayee.Idcodep  precodeltTextBox Grid.Row7 Grid.Column1 TextBinding PathSelectedPayee.Id gt codepre  pThat displayed the correct number at design time and runtime, and is updated appropriately whenever I change the selection in the codeComboBoxcode.  The only thing that is not working correctly is the codeComboBoxcode is not correctly displaying the codePayeecode codeAccountNamecode when I navigate to the page.  As I said, the design view is correctly displaying the dummy data that I have in my designer codeViewModelcode.  Is there something special about a codeComboBoxcode that I am perhaps doing something in the wrong orderp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI also am getting the exact same results using p  precodeSelectedValueBinding PathSelectedPayee.Id, ModeTwoWay codepre  pThe binding is displaying the correct codePayee.Idcode in the codeTextBoxcode depending on which codePayeecode is selected in the codeComboBoxcode, but it just does not display the codeSelectedPayeecode when I first navigate to the page but the codeTextBoxcode will be populated with the correct codeIdcode.  This is really a head scratcher to me....p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI got it all straightened out.  The final issue I had going was I was setting the codeSelectedPayeecode before actually loading the codeComboBoxcode, so there was no property changes to trigger the codeSelectedValuecode of the codeComboBoxcode to change.  Once I moved the call to codeLoadPayeescode above the assignment to codeSelectedValuecode, everything works like a charm.  strongSee answer below.strongp

Negative 5036 pThis is my first post, but Ive frequented SO for help plenty of times. Still, please bear with me if I am not following proper etiquette. So to be brief, Im working on a tricky problem involving pointers. Ill copy and paste it here because Im worried Id otherwise leave out important info p  pGiven a PHB list 1000 elementsints from 1100 of inlen the pointer towards the last element elements without any duplicates and pointed by inlist, the function will p  ul li1 determine if it is possible to generate the sum of 31 within 5 consecutive elements li li2 if it is possible, return one list pointed by outlist that consists of positions of the list whose associated values add up to the number 31 li li3 if it is possible, return the list length pointed by outlen. li ul  pNote that each element can only be used once. In addition, you need to return only one list if multiple cases exist. For example, if a PHB list is code9, 5, 16, 22, 1, 37, 26, 14code, then the returning value of the function is true, and outlist contains code9, 5, 16, 1code and its length is 4, or it contains code9, 22code and its length is 2. Note that the list code16, 1, 14code is not qualified since the set of three values spans more than 5 elements. As another example, if a PHB list is code9, 5, 34code, it returns false. outlist will be empty with a length of 0.p  pThats it. At first, I attempted hard coding in tons of options along the lines of  p  precodeif inlist, inlist  1, inlist  2, inlist  3, inlist4         add up to 31,  not actual codejust odd formatting  or inlist, inlist  1, inlist  2, inlist  3,  add up to 31 or inlist, inlist  1, inlist  2, inlist  4, add up to 31 or inlist, inlist  1, inlist  3, inlist  4, add to 31 or inlist, inlist  2, inlist  3, inlist  4 add to 31 or inlist, inlist  1, inlist  2,  add up to 31  codepre  petcetc,  but quickly realized I just dont know what Im doing here. Fortunately, the outlist only needs one list that adds up to 31. Id appreciate any sort of help.

Negative 5036 pI have a program that plays bingo. It creates a random bingo board, and continuously makes random balls, and if the ball matches a number and column on the board, replaces it with an X.

Negative 5036 pI have a hard time modeling a website with webdriver javap  pCase          N pieces of Tabs                   N pieces of subTabsp  p Transition buttonsp  pThis site is an intranet for managing client requests. It is workflow based. Example The user wants buy insurance for their car. You fill out a bunch of forms, and pushing a transition button returns with a different set of tabs  subtabs. The case itself has workflow steps, each with a preconfigured list of tabs assigned to it. Transition buttons are the fork points of the workflow. So pushing button A goes in one direction resulting a set of tabs  subtabs, pushing button B will take the case into another state with another type of forms e.g. rectification. The current state of the case Step1, StepN is visible in the case header. What I initially thought is to create the  following structurep  precodepublic Case      private ListltTabsgt     blabla...   public abstract class Tab      private ListltSubTabsgt     public abstract fillFormSomeDataType data   public abstract class SubTab      public abstract fillFormSomeDataType data  codepre  pMy problem with this is, that I want to be able to have exactly those subtabs and tabs in the list which are defined in the app. But right now I have no clue how to introduce the workflow above or below the case object. Also, this construction has the downside, that I can only acces the forms through the fillForm method, and no specific methods of each specific tab, or subtab. What is the best design approach if any to handle these kind of situationp

Negative 5036 pI think I need a HList that is constrained to have all of its elements being a subtype of a certain type. codeLUBConstraintcode seems to be what I want, and indeed it does constrain the emconstructionem of such a HList  but I cant see how to get the evidence out again, so that I can map actually, traverse, because it needs to be monadic over the HList and call a method that exists in the LUB type on each of the elements.p  pIn addition, I want the type of the HList resulting from the traverse operation to be exactly the same type as the type of the input HList.p  pThe use case is a kind of functional listener list  all of the elements of the HList are listeners which must be notified of events, accept or reject them, and return new versions of themselves with updated internal state.

Essays can consist of a number of elements, including literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays e.g. Alexander Popes An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man. While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Lockes An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthuss An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples. In some countries e.g., the United States and Canada, essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants and, in the humanities and social sciences, as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams. codepre

One of my constraint is that i must connect to this device only when i have to send a command or read data. I must disconnect as soon as possible when its done, to allow other potential users to do the same.p  pOne of the features of the app is the following p  ul liUsers can enable an automatic command while the app is in the background. This automatic command triggers if the device hasnt been detected within 10 minutes.li liMy app scans until it finds my BLE device.li liIn order to keep it awake when i need it, im restarting the scan each time, because of the CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey option ignorance.li liWhen its detected, im checking if the last detection was more than 10 minutes ago. If thats the case, i connect to the device and then write into the characteristic corresponding to the service i need.li ul  pThe goal is to trigger this device when user come in range. It may happen a few minutes after being out of range such as a few hours, it depends on my users habits. p  pEverything is working fine this way, but sometimes it seems like happening at random times, the scan sort of freezes. My process is done well, but after a couple of time, i see my app scanning, but my didDiscoverPeripheral call back is never called, even if my testing device is right in front of my BLE device. Sometimes it may take a while to detect it, but here, nothing happens after a couple of minutes.p  pI was thinking that iOS may have killed my app to claim back memory, but when i turn off and on Bluetooth, strongcentralManagerDidUpdateStatestrong is called the right way. If my app where killed, it shouldnt be the case right  If i open my app, the scan is restarted and its coming back to life. I also checked that iOS doesnt shutdown my app after 180 seconds of activity, but thats not the case because its working well after this amount of time.p  pIve set up my .plist to have the right settings strongbluetoothcentralstrong in strongUIBackgroundModesstrong. My class managing all BLE processing is stored in my strongAppDelegatestrong as a singleton accessible through all of my app. Ive also tested to switch where im creating this object. Currently im creating it in the strongapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsstrong method.

Negative 5036 pI have a question about Entity Frameworks loading behavior. In my ASP.NET MVC5 application, there is an ApplicationUser model, UserProfile modelfor basic profile information such as name, address, gender etc, and UserContactProfile, UserEducationProfile, UserJobProfile modelsfor secondary information not usually needed. p  pIn this relationship, ApplicationUser owns a UserProfile, while UserProfile owns a UserContactProfile, UserEducationProfile and UserJobProfile. The issue is that I want ApplicationUser to always eager load UserProfile, but UserProfile to lazy load subprofiles such as UserContactProfile. How is this possible p  pIve tried writing some kind of code, while this does not seem to workp  precodevar user  Db.Users.FindId codepre  pThe one below actually does the trickp  precodevar user  Db.Users.Includeu gt u.Profile.Whereu gt u.Id  userId.First codepre  pThe idea is that I want the eagerlazy loading behaviors to be automatic, so even the first code that did not work before will pull User and UserProfile information. How is this achievable I heard that editing ApplicationDbContexts onModelBinding method may work, but I havent found a way yet. p

Negative 5036 pI am very new to API programming.

I can only view them, I can not write them readonly access.p  pWhen I end my process,  there is a created folder called bfscache that gets saved onto my virtual machine.  This cache directory is only accessible when the program ends, and it turns out that the files have writeaccess under this cached directory.p  pThe problem is that I am unable to figure out how to write the cached files into physical memory when the application is running.p  pI am reading this see below website, and it shows that private memory mapping page caches, that APIs use, have read only permissions.  Yet this website does not explain how to switch the page cache to have shared memory mapping which has write access.p  pa hrefhttpduartes.orggustavoblogpostpagecachetheaffairbetweenmemoryandfiles relnofollowhttpduartes.orggustavoblogpostpagecachetheaffairbetweenmemoryandfilesap  pUsing linux x86, is there a command that I can invoke that will search for a file in the cache and write it to physical memoryp  pUsing an API, how can I change the readonly permissions using the AWS Rest APIp  pNote  this space dock  package automatically generates all the GET, and query commands used in an OAuth work flow.

What I want to do is take a screenshot whenever the user touches the screen.p  pWhen I take a screenshot with Power amp Volume Button it works perfectly. Is there an Intent which takes this kind of a screenshot Ideally the screenshot would only contain the webview, but if its the entire screen I can work with that too.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pCheers,p  pTobyp  pEdit some of my codep  precodeView rootView ValueCallbackltStringgt callback  new ValueCallbackltStringgt      Override     public void onReceiveValueString value          category1.setTextvalue       String root  android.os.Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory         Environment.DIRECTORYDCIM.toString, filename, time, puretime, movementType   movementType is set according to MotionEvent.getAction File myDir  new Fileroot  savedfiles  protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      requestWindowFeatureWindow.FEATURENOTITLE     super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      rootView  findViewByIdandroid.R.id.content.getRootView     rootView.setDrawingCacheEnabledtrue   public class MyView extends View      public MyViewContext context          supercontext           Override     public boolean onTouchEventMotionEvent event          calendar  Calendar.getInstance         time  String.format02d02d02d.03d, calendar.getCalendar.HOUROFDAY,                 calendar.getCalendar.MINUTE, calendar.getCalendar.SECOND,                 calendar.getCalendar.MILLISECOND         puretime  String.format02d02d02d03d, calendar.getCalendar.HOUROFDAY,                 calendar.getCalendar.MINUTE, calendar.getCalendar.SECOND,                 calendar.getCalendar.MILLISECOND         if movementType.equalsdown              try                  filename  puretime  .xml                 webView.saveWebArchivemyDirfilename, false, callback              catch Exception e                  e.printStackTrace                               invalidate         return true      codepre  pedit2p  papparently the problem for the black rectangles is that elements as the video are processed by the gpu and for a normal snapshot to work the program would need to calculate every frame which is too much work.p

Negative 5036 pI am using apache PropertiesConfiguration to read the property file. I have a requirement that multiple jms events read the properties from this file. I want to understand the below questions.p  p1 If I add new property, does this class reloads the application instance to refresh the propertyp  p2 Will there be thread issues when multiple JMS messages read this property file.p  p3 I will also add new property while these threads are reading the property. Will this cause any issue or by default it is thread safe.p  pI did go through the documentation..but was not that clear.p

Negative 5036 pI would like to run a phantomJS script which tries to add a phone number to an account. The trouble is, once the phone number is added I then need to add the code that was sent to the users phone. p  pFor the life of me I cant seem to figure out how to do something this complex in phantom or other headless browsers. p  pIdeap  pMy thinking is I could create a phantomjs process and then use a web server to communicate with it. I would spin up two separate browser windows the first would connect to my web server and the second would connect to whatever service I was trying to add a mobile number to. I would then let my webserver know that I was ready for the code, once my webserver got the message I would ask the user for the code sent to their phone and then once they enter it, change the html or whatever on the web page phantom has opened then extract the code from that and enter it in the other page. p  pMy question is, how possible is this Can any one think of a better solution Solutions using other headless browsers are more then welcome. p

Negative 5036 pI am creating a database to store food orders, and I am considering the most efficient ways for storing it. And I figured that hexidecimal is the most efficient storage mechanism.p  pA food order would include any number of food item, plus any additions to each food item.p  pSo, a cheese burger with extra cheese, and a pizza with extra peperoni could be stored asp  p300050AF200010Fp  pWhere as the F serves as the comma, to separate the food items, and the very first values 3, and 2, correspond the the food item, all the values in the middle, represent the various toppings, and choices of each item.p  pSo it can be seen as 300050AF Cheese burger 200010F Pizza 500210B0F any possible additional food items, along with topping choices for this orderp  pThe food item can be different lengths, because of the F comma, as some items have much more topping choices than othersp  pFirst question is, is this the most efficient means of storagep  pSecond question is that MYSQL doesnt seem to have a hexadecimal datatype, so I would have to store it as binary, if so, what is the most efficient way to convert various values from real data to and from binary Javascript, and how efficient is MySQL binary storagep  pAlso, how would an ENUM or set compare as data storage mediansp

Negative 5036 pThe brief description of the problem is that Doctrine2 when caching query not query result ignores filters. My question is what is the best practice to keep using cache and make Doctrine apply filters. Below is the detailed description of the problem.p  pIm creating the application using Doctrine2 ORM ver 2.5 now.

Next time I run request it doesnt check for any filters, find the original query in the cache and use it. So filters are ignored.p  pThe simplest solution that works is to disable the query cache. But This query is run hundreds of time during script execution so I want to keep using cache. p  pAre there any best practices that can help me with thisp

However I found dozens of thirdparty libraries about that, but the implementation varies too much and it looks like that there is no consensus.p  pI would like to get a NavigationDrawer whuch opens from the left, and based on what you click on the NavigationDrawer menu, I would also like to have tabbed fragmentImplemented with TabsLayout and ViewPager in the Fragment on click of the first NavigationDrawer item under the toolbar.p  pThis is my codep  pactivitymain.xmlp  pp  precodeltandroid.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto androidididdrawerlayout androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidfitsSystemWindowstruegt  ltFrameLayout     androidididmaincontent     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidbackgroundcolorcolorPrimary     androidfitsSystemWindowstrue gt   ltandroid.support.design.widget.NavigationView     androidididmenucontainer     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidlayoutgravitystart     androidbackgroundffffff     androidclickabletrue     appheaderLayoutlayoutnavheader     appitemBackgroundattrselectableItemBackground     appmenumenumenunavigation gt  ltandroid.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayoutgt codepre  pfragment1.xmlp  precodeltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto androidididtabanimmaincontent androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt  ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout     androidididtabanimappbar     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidthemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBargt      ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar         androidididtabanimtoolbar         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightattractionBarSize         androidbackgroundattrcolorPrimary         applayoutscrollFlagsscrollenterAlways         apppopupThemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Light gt      ltandroid.support.design.widget.TabLayout         androidididtabanimtabs         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt  ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayoutgt  ltandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager     androidididtabanimviewpager     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     applayoutbehaviorstringappbarscrollingviewbehavior gt  ltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayoutgt codepre

Negative 5036 pI want to populate an index but make it searchable only after Im done. Is there a standard way of doing that with elastic search I think I can set codeindex.blocks.read truecode but Id like a way to be able to ask elastic for a list of the searchable indices and I dont know how to do that with that setting. Also closingopening an index feels a bit cumbersome.p  pA solution I found is to add a document to each index defining that indexs status. Though querying for the list of indices is a bit annoying. Specifically since querying and paginating a long list of 2,000 index status documents is problematic. Scrollscan is a solution because it gives me all the results in one go because every shard has at most 1 index status document. Though that feels like Im using the wrong tool for the job i.e. a scrollscan op that always does exactly one scroll.p  pI dont want one document that references all the indices because then Id have to garbage collect it manually alongside garbage collecting indices. But maybe thats the best tradeoff...p  pIs there a standard practice that Im not aware ofp

Negative 5036 pTheres a somewhat similar question here, but it didnt solve my problem, so geres the deal. Ive created a  gitolite server on my secundar machine, but Im also hosting a web service there. My intention is that the web service can communicate with it, for exemple, add a new repository. For that, I need to clone the gitoliteadmin repository to the same machine where the server is hosted.p  pSo, Ive created the user git, that is in charge of the gitolite server. Ive tried generate sshkey pair and copied to my primary machine so I could add it to the users on the gitoliteadmin repository.p  pBut, on the secondary machine, where the server is hosted, with a user different from git, when I try to git clone gitlocalhostgitoliteadmin, it saysp  precode          WARNING UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE            Permissions 0644 for homepi.sshraspi.pub are too open.

Negative 5036 pIm trying to use a Hibernate JPA repository method as the method for a serviceactivator.

I also dont need to explicitly define the lineupRepository bean as the Repository annotation handles this for me.p  pAs a result of the above it produces the following exeption.p  precodeCaused by org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name org.springframework.integration.handler.MessageHandlerChain9child0.handler FactoryBean threw exception on object creation nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException Target object of type [class com.sun.proxy.Proxy79] has no eligible methods for handling Messages. codepre  pFinally I do have a work around in place that seems to get the job done. But it is an obvious work around and I suspect shouldnt be neccesary. The work around consists of creating a new bean, explicitly defining the bean in the context XML and calling that method instead of the method on repository. So my work around looks a bit like this first the workarounds context looks like this instead.p  precodeltintchain inputchannelbootstrapLineupCdsStart outputchannelbootstrapLineupItemCdsStartgt     ltintserviceactivator reflineupRepositoryService methodfindByIntegrationStatusNew gt     ltintfilter expressionpayload.isEmpty discardchannelbootstrapLineupItemCdsStartgt     ltintsplitter expressionpayloadgt     ltintserviceactivator reflineupServicePipeline methodcreateLineupgt     ltintaggregatorgt ltintchaingt ltbean idlineupRepositoryService classcom.mypackage.LineupRepositoryServicegt codepre  pNotice the first serviceactivator now references LineupRepositoryService instead of LineupRepository, and I also added a new bean definition.p  pSecond in the work around, of course, I also defined a LineupRespositoryService class that looks like the following.p  precodepublic class LineupRepositoryService      Autowired     private LineupRepository lineupRepository      public ListltLineupEntitygt findByIntegrationStatusNew          return lineupRepository.findByIntegrationStatusNew       codepre  pThe workaround works, but Id rather do it the right way. So anyone know how I can get it to properly work or what is going on herep

the hidden TextView on the basis of pixels swiped. However, there are some problems. Below are my issues.p  ol lipSuppose I started the swipe and the hidden TextView is partiallyhalf visible. Before the hidden TextView becomes completely visible I scrolled the ListView, now the ListView started scrolling. Now if again I will start the swipe, the restother half of the hidden TextView is not becoming visible. How can I handle this If its not possible to handle then atleast tell me how to disable the ListView scroll when the swipe is started and enable the ListView scroll once swipe is stopped.pli lipSecond issue is, if I start the swipe from the empty area of the ListView i.e. middle portion of left and right TextView then the swipe works perfectly fine. However, if I start the swipe from the right or left TextView then instead of the swipe, the click listener of the TextViews is fired. When I click on the right or left TextView then their onClickListener should get fired and when I swipe then the ListViews swipe should get fired.pli ol  pPlease help me out with this implementation.p  pemNote This is not like traditional ListView swipe functionality. In traditional ListView swipe, complete row is swiped to the left and the hidden view is revealed. In my case I want only part of the row blue bubbles to slide to reveal the hidden view timestamp. Grey bubbles stay fixed. And I want this on all the rows of ListView not just single row. For traditional ListView swipe there are a lot of libraries out there like a hrefhttpsgithub.combaoyongzhangSwipeMenuListView relnofollowSwipeMenuListViewa, a hrefhttpsgithub.com47degandroidswipelistview relnofollowandroidswipelistviewa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comdaimajiaAndroidSwipeLayout relnofollowAndroidSwipeLayouta and many others, but these doesnt fulfill my requirement.emp

Negative 5036 h2Questionh2  pHow could I create a function which would take a .Rmd file containing htmlwidgets code as its input, and output a html file containing its JavaScriptCSS dependenciesp  pSpecifically, the tempfile rmarkdown generates for pandocs codeincludeinheadercode argument, when rendering to html.p  h2Detailsh2  pExample  myfile.Rmdp  precodeThis is some text  r librarydygraphs dygraphnhtemp, main  New Haven Temperatures  codepre  pRunning codermarkdownrendermyfile.Rmdcode passes a tempfile to the codeincludeinheadercode pandoc argument, containing all the JavaScript and CSS needed to render the interactive graphic either compressed datauri format, or html links to copied files. This is included in the final html file, so that everything renders in the browser.

Id like to be able to generate this file for arbitrary .Rmd documents containing htmlwidgets code.p  h2Contexth2  pIm interested in blogging using knitr and Jekyll, as Yihui outlines a hrefhttpsgithub.comyihuiknitrjekyll relnofollowherea. However, the disadvantage of this approach is that none of the htmlwidgets functionality works, because the a hrefhttpsgithub.comyihuiknitrjekyllissues8 relnofollowdependency injection step is misseda.
