Furthermore, the beach tap occurs first, so I cant even put in a if touchedStone then dont run touchedBeach type flag.p  pHeres some code. On BeachView.mp  precode  voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       if self.decelerating  didScroll  YES          else  didScroll  NO        UITouch touch  [[event allTouches] anyObject]      CGPoint touchLocation  [touch locationInViewtouch.view]      NSLogtouched beach  , [touch view]      lastTouch  touchLocation      [super touchesBegantouches withEventevent]   voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       didScroll  YES      [super touchesMovedtouches withEventevent]   voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       if didScroll  NO  isPaused  NO             [self touchedBeachYES locationlastTouch]            [super touchesEndedtouches withEventevent]  codepre  pOn Stone.mp  precode voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       [parent stoneWasTouched]  parent  ivar pointing from stone to beachview   voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       UITouch touch  [[event allTouches] anyObject]      CGPoint touchLocation  [touch locationInViewtouch.view]      NSLogtouched stone  , [touch view]      [parent touchedStoneYES locationtouchLocation]  codepre  pAfter a stone tap, My NSLog looks like thisp  precode Touched beach  ltBeachView 0x1276a0gt ran touchedBeach Touched Stone  ltStone 0x1480c0gt ran touchedStone codepre  pSo its actually running both. Whats even stranger is if I take the touchesBegan and touchesEnded out of Stone.m but leave userInteractionEnabled  YES, the beachView registers both touches itself, but returns the Stone as the view it touched the second time.p  precode Touched beach  ltBeachView 0x1276a0gt ran touchedBeach Touched beach  ltStone 0x1480c0gt ran touchedBeach codepre  pSo PLEASE, Ive been trying to sort this for days. How do I make it so a tapped stone calls only touchedStone and a tapped beach calls only touchedBeach Where am I going wrongp

Negative 1704 pIve got a process which attempts to decode different encodings of strings from a binary stream.  I get some behavior which does not quite add up in my mind when I step through it.

What confuses me is that some times the exception arises when I call codeGetCharCountcode and other times it occurs when I call codeGetStringcode.  Is there any reason this should be happening  Is this in fact expected  I would like to be able to reliably check for the presence of printable characters in as few places as possible  currently Im doing it in several places.p  pAny thoughtsp  pthanks, brianp  pstrongBIG UPDATEstrong It seems that my initial description of the problem is lacking a bit.

I can get extra information back from my controller if something went wrong, and then show an error message based on that.p  pHowever, recently Ive been really annoyed with all the extra work that goes into maintaining HTML structure both in my partial views and the part that generates HTML from Json.p  pI like to make a jQuery ajax request and then have the controller return PartialViewmypartialview and then just use jQuery to replace to HTML in the view.p  pHowever, this way I cannot attach extra data from the controller  its either whatever the partial view gives me  or nothing. At least thats my current take on it.p  pIf some validation goes wrong at some point in my controller action I dont want to return the HTML of the partial view.p  pSo how do you go about handling this issuep  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 1704 pI am writing Windows Hooks for DirectX 6.1. I want to intercept calls for EMBM Environment Mapped Bump Mapping and pass the data to own bump shader, so application which depend on EMBM will work correctly. The only problem is that DX 6.1 dont allow shaders at all. I cant simple replace Direct3DDevice3 with class from newer SDK, because its methods uses different sets of arguments and application that use my hooked dll will crash. I do not know how to workaround through. I am not so good at DirectX maybe there is more effective way to implement bump in DX 6.1 that will work on modern hardware Maybe it is possible to query some interface in D3Device that will allow me to use shadersp  pAnything that could point me in right direction would be much appreciated.p
Negative 1704 pGreetings, everyone.  I consider myself to be an intermediate developer, but, to be candid, probably closer to novice than expert. In any case, I have more experience with C and the .NET platform, but my current job has me working almost exclusively with Java. This in itself is sort of a problem, but Im dealing with it fine and Im not really in a position to change my role at the moment.p  pOn the side, I am starting to work on a highly interactive, databasedriven web project. Im doing it because I feel that its a great idea and I know that the experience of doing something like this from scratch will help me immensely.p  pI initially wanted to go with ASP.NET MVC and I am still leaning that direction. Im not even sure why, but I love the community behind it and, in my opinion, Visual Studio is the best IDE around. However, doing that would be counterproductive to my current job. That brought me to Grails. Even though I realize that Groovy is not Java, it seems to be similar enough not to mention that it runs on the JVM that the skills I learn should still help me at my current job. The more I looked into Grails, the more I loved it, especially after having to deal with what I consider to be an extremely complex J2EE environment at work.p  pBut with the good I found the bad. I cant help but notice that there are a lot of developers who are irritated with the amount of bugs in Grails. Being that I am starting a new project and I am fairly inexperienced, do I even want to consider Grails Is it a liability And whats the consensus about its longevity I would really hate to get too involved if there is a good chance of it fading into obscurity within the next few years. And even if the bugs and longevity issues arent a huge deal, how would you compare the ease of development of Grails with that of ASP.NET MVC I realize this last part is highly subjective. But for the sake of comparison, lets say that someone with virtually no technical background were in the same position. Would you recommend they take a look at ASP.NET MVC or Grailsp  pThanks so much. If anything needs clarified or reworded, please let me know. I sincerely hope Im not opening a can of worms...p

The web service is essentially just a database of usernames and hashed passwords. Imagine a desktop application that keeps usernames and passwords in a remote database. The end user types their username and password into the application and the application accesses the web service to authenticate the user.p  pSo, the application will need to send an end users username and plaintext password to the service.

The application itself will have to authenticate before it can access the service, but I am just wondering what is the best way to send the end users username and password to the service for authenticating the end user. I dont to use a POST method because I am simply authenticating and therefore not changing the state of the server. Sorry for the confusion. p

Negative 1704 pI have a job board where a user submits his location, via GoogleMaps API, which plots the job on a map.p  pThe problem is, because it is a location based job board, I want to make the most broad input allowable a ZIP code so users can either enter a ZIP code or address.  Is there anyway to either parse the input to determine whether its a zip code or address  or does Google Maps API return anything that would let me know how broad the input the user supplied wasp
Negative 1704 pSo a couple of weeks ago I installed an intranet solution for a client.. For this, they also wanted to integrate their local Active Directory with auto login Single Sign On.  After several tries and fails with Apaches solutions, I desided to use IIS7 on a Windows 2008 RC2. The problem was, Ive had no experience with neither a Windows Server nor a ISS server.. or any other servers for that matter.. xampp is my friend   After a couple of hours I was able to finally fetch the AD username from SERVER[REMOTEUSER].  Which is what I check for in my PHP autologin script. This was an easy setup because the intranet was only going to be accessed by computers inside their local network.p  pSince then, Ive been working for another client with the same intranet solution. Only this time their AD is hosted by a company on the other side of the country. With very strict rules. The Intranet should also be available for members not logged into their domain Internet. These members should be able to log in via a standard form with a  username  email and password stored in a MySQL database.p  pI now have a working setup. But its not what I was looking for. First the members must connect to the AD domain using the Citrix. Second they have to setup their IE browser add a hrefhttpsmyintranet.com relnofollowhttpsmyintranet.coma to tools  Internet Options  Security  Trusted sites. By doing this they wont get a popup dialog asking for their domainusername and password. Members trying to access the site outside the domain is always met with a popup.p  pTomorrow I have a meeting with the client, and Im worried sick  This is not what I promised them. So Im wondering and hoping anyone here can tell me if this is even possible. If so, how can I remove the popup box and allow a login via a standard HTML form like mentioned above What am I doing wrong  Ive included some screenshots from the IIS 7 serverp  pimg srchttpimg3.imageshack.usimg32591iis7setup1.jpg altalt text img srchttpimg683.imageshack.usimg6839266iis7setup2.jpg altalt textp

Negative 1704 pFirst, a little explanation of emwhyem Im asking this question in the first place Im writing a python program with a wxPython gui that needs to call a Java AWT program from python and extract data from it. I have an inprocess working solution on Windows. I also have an inprocess solution on OSX so long as I run the Java app headless. Unfortunately there is no reasonable solution that I have found for running both GUIs within the same process on OSX because both AWT and WX both want the first thread and cannot share the wx message loop.p  pWhat I would like to do is to launch a Java program in a separate process from my Python program and establish a pipe or queue or something for passing data specifically byte arrays back and forth.p  pId greatly appreciate any suggestions, or even a nudge in the right direction as I have very little experience with IPC.p
Negative 1704 pHaving recently worked on a project which required some more IO interaction than Im used to, I felt like I wanted to look past the regular libraries Commons IO, in particular and tackle some more in depth IO issues.p  pAs an academic test, I decided to implement a basic, multithreaded HTTP downloader. The idea is simple provide a URL to download, and the code will download the file. To increase download speeds, the file is chunked and each chunk is downloaded concurrently using the HTTP codeRange bytesxxcodeheader to use as much bandwidth as possible.p  pI have a working prototype, but as you may have guessed, its not exactly ideal. At the moment I manually start 3 downloader threads which each download 13 of the file. These threads use a common, synchronized file writer instance to actually write the files to disk. When all threads are done, the file writer is completed and any open streams are closed. Some snippets of code to give you an ideap  pThe thread startupp  precodeExecutorService downloadExecutor  Executors.newFixedThreadPool3 ... downloadExecutor.executenew DownloaderfileWriter, download, start1, end1 downloadExecutor.executenew DownloaderfileWriter, download, start2, end2 downloadExecutor.executenew DownloaderfileWriter, download, start3, end3 codepre  pEach downloader thread downloads a chunk buffered and uses the file writer to write to diskp  precodeint bytesRead  0 byte[] buffer  new byte[10241024] InputStream inStream  entity.getContent long seekOffset  chunkStart while bytesRead  inStream.readbuffer  1      fileWriter.writebuffer, bytesRead, seekOffset     seekOffset  bytesRead  codepre  pThe file writer writes to disk using a codeRandomAccessFilecode to codeseekcodeand codewritecode the chunks to diskp  precodepublic synchronized void writebyte[] bytes, int len, long start throws IOException        output.seekstart       output.writebytes, 0, len  codepre  pAll things considered, this approach seems to work. However, it doesnt work very well. Id appreciate some advicehelpopinions on the following points. Much appreciated.p  ol liThe strongCPU usagestrong of this code is through the roof. Its using half my CPU 50 of each of the 2 cores to do this, which is exponentially more than comparable downloading tools which barely stress the CPU at all. Im a bit mystified as to where this CPU usage comes from, as I wasnt expecting this.li liUsually, there seems to be 1 of the 3 threads that is stronglagging behindstrong significantly. The other 2 threads will finish, after which it takes the third thread which seems to be mostly the first thread with the first chunk 30 or more seconds to complete. I can see from the task manager that the javaw process is still doing small IO writes, but I dont really know why this happens Im guessing race conditions.li liDespite the fact that Ive chosen quite a big buffer 1MB, I get the feeling that the codeInputStreamcode almost never actually fills the buffer, which causes more IO writes than I would like. Im under the impression that in this scenario, it would be best to keep the IO access to a minimum, but I dont know for sure whether this is the best approach.li liI realise Java may not be the ideal language to do something like this, but Im convinced theres much more performance to be had than I get in my current implementation. Is NIO worth exploring in this caseli ol  pemNoteem I use Apache HTTPClient to do the HTTP interaction, which is where the codeentity.getContentcode comes from in case anyone is wondering.p

Negative 1704 pIm trying to make a vector drawing application using OpenGL which will allow the user to see the result in real time. The way I have it set up is with an edge flag callback so the glu tesselator only outputs triangles which I then pass to a VBO. Iv tried t make all my algorithms as fast as possible and this is not where my issue is. According to a few code profilers, my big slowdown occurs in a call to GLUTessEndPolygon which is the function that makes the polygon. I have found that when the shape exceeds 100 input verticies, it gets really really slow and basically destroys all the hard work I did to optimize everything else. What can I do I provide the normal of 0,0,1. I also tried all the tips from the GL redbook. Is there a way to make the tesselator tesselate quicker but with less precisionp  pThanksp

Negative 1704 pI have a GenericForeignKey in an inline on an admin page. Being a GenericFK there are 2 fields involved in it The ContentType FK and the objectid integer field. The GenericFK can, of course, point to a variety of models and objects, some that have image fields and some that dont. My goal is to customize one of the widgets it can be either, but Im trying for the objectid one such that if the object the GenericFK points to has an image, it displays a thumbnail of it.p  pThe problem Im running into is that Im not aware of a way for a widget to know the value of another field when it is being drawn, since in order for the objectid or ContentType fields widget to find what object the GenericFK is pointing to, it needs both values. Is there a way to do this short of just going about this some other way completely, like using AJAX calls to pull in the thumbnails after the page loadsp

Hoping someone here has or has worked on a similar project.p  pMy application is a basic CRUD application that Ive broken down in to separate areas of concern and hence modules. However, I want all the modules to share one common local SQL Express database.

How can I go about accomplishing thisp  pIve thought about just adding in all my tables initially but this seems to break the principal of modularity in my mind. Perhaps my thinking is wrong, but what would be the point of loosely coupled modules if the database is already fully aware and strongly coupled to a given module from db creationp  pLooking for some insight. p

Negative 1704 pWhat is the best way of turning a Canvas element into a link  by this I mean the whole canvas element, not just a part of the image.p  pI have tried the obvious thing  wrapping the element in an A element  but finding issues in IE9.p  pTake this markup for examplep  precodelta hreflinkgt   ltcanvas width100 height100gt     fallback   ltcanvasgt ltagt codepre  pUsing CSS I have styled the link background colour to change on hover, and am finding in most modern canvas supporting browsers it works as expected  you hover, the background changes colour, you click the link, the link is followed.p  pHowever, in IE9 when hovering over the element it doesnt recognise that its a link  no hover effect, no cursor changing to a pointer, clicking does nowt.p  pInterestingly, if I add a 1 pixel border to the A element, and hover the mouse precariously over the 1 pixel border, IE9 does recognise the link, and after that you can move the mouse over the canvas and it maintains its hover state and works as a link.p  pIts almost as if the canvas is overriding the link, so the browser isnt able to recognise the link, only the canvas element  if that makes sensep  pSo, really I just want to ascertainp  ul liIs is acceptable to simply wrap a Canvas element in an A element  is this just IE9 being weird or am I doing it wrongli liIf Im doing it wrong, what is the accepted technique for doing this seemingly simple taskli ul  pThanksp  h2UPDATEh2  pOK, so the answers Ive had below are all correct, but unfortunately werent working in my implementation either.

Negative 1704 pIm creating reports with Jasper Reports 4.0.0 for our project JRE 1.6.x.p  pIm getting bothered with codeNullPointerExceptioncodes in my scriptlets, as they do not cause the report to abort, they just make the field be silently evaluated to codenullcode. As far as I tested, it happens only to NPEs.p  pThe generated reports are quite important and should not have any errors. So, if an exception occurs like NPEs for some missing data, it should stop the generation, and the database andor report should be fixed. Such behavior may hide some report coding errors, unless someone spots the missing field.p  pWhat is the reason for this behavior with NPEs Is there any compilation option or execution flag I can switch to make NPEs bubble up as other exceptions do I really wish I wont have to wrap every scriptlet method in a codetry..catchcode block and throw another exception on NPEs.p  pThanksp  hr  pOk, a sample report. It does not uses scriptlets, but generate the NPE directly on a field evaluation the result is the same, and can be executed directly on iReport preview without parametersp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltjasperReport xmlnshttpjasperreports.sourceforge.netjasperreports xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpjasperreports.sourceforge.netjasperreports httpjasperreports.sourceforge.netxsdjasperreport.xsd nameNPEReport pageWidth595 pageHeight842 columnWidth555 leftMargin20 rightMargin20 topMargin20 bottomMargin20gt     ltproperty nameireport.zoom value1.0gt     ltproperty nameireport.x value0gt     ltproperty nameireport.y value0gt     ltvariable nameNullVariable classjava.lang.Integer calculationSystemgt         ltinitialValueExpressiongtlt[CDATA[null]]gtltinitialValueExpressiongt     ltvariablegt     ltvariable nameNotNullVariable classjava.lang.Integer calculationSystemgt         ltinitialValueExpressiongtlt[CDATA[200]]gtltinitialValueExpressiongt     ltvariablegt     lttitlegt         ltband height72 splitTypeStretchgt             ltstaticTextgt                 ltreportElement x11 y10 width179 height22gt                 lttextElementgt                     ltfont size14gt                 lttextElementgt                 lttextgtlt[CDATA[Successful field evaluation]]gtlttextgt             ltstaticTextgt             lttextFieldgt                 ltreportElement x190 y10 width296 height22gt                 lttextElementgt                     ltfont size14gt                    lttextElementgt                 lttextFieldExpression classjava.lang.Stringgtlt[CDATA[0xInteger.toHexStringVNotNullVariable.intValue55]]gtlttextFieldExpressiongt             lttextFieldgt             ltstaticTextgt                 ltreportElement x11 y32 width179 height22gt                 lttextElementgt                     ltfont size14gt                 lttextElementgt                 lttextgtlt[CDATA[NPE on field evaluation]]gtlttextgt             ltstaticTextgt             lttextFieldgt                 ltreportElement x190 y32 width296 height22gt                 lttextElementgt                     ltfont size14gt                 lttextElementgt                 lttextFieldExpression classjava.lang.Stringgtlt[CDATA[0xInteger.toHexStringVNullVariable.intValue55]]gtlttextFieldExpressiongt             lttextFieldgt         ltbandgt     lttitlegt     ltdetailgt         ltband height24 splitTypeStretchgt     ltdetailgt ltjasperReportgt codepre

Negative 1704 pIm writing a JOCl.org which is different then jogamps jocl running on GPU.  Were working with sufficient data that I need to be careful to stay under the GPUs global memory limit.  To do this I need a way of programmatically determining how much memory the GPU has.  I assume there must be a simple JOCL methodvariable to do this, but for some reason I cant seem to figure out what it is.  Ive looked at the CL.CLMEMSIZE and CLDEVICEGLOBALMEMCACHESIZE but these both return something around 4100 I know Im currently working with a graphics card that is suppose to contain 512 MB.p  pAlso, I cant seem to use nearly as much memory as I should.  In my worst case scenario I have to run a kernel that processes frames of 222 floats and will internally require twice as much data as frame size.  If I try to cache two frames so 2 frames  222  22 bytesfloat  2 for overhead  226 I can cache without difficulty, but when I increase my caching so I process three frames at a time or 2253 I appear to run out of memory.  However, I believe I should only be using  100 of my 512 MB of global memory.  I believe Im properly freeing memory when not used, but apparently Im either doing something wrong or am misinterpreting the GPUs advertised 512 MB.  Can anyone help explain this confusion to mep  pIs there a way I can profile the GPU to get a sense for actual memory usagep
Negative 1704 pI want to combine pseudo streaming of FLV videos with bandwidth control on IIS7.5.p  pPseudostreaming is the ability to seekjump within a video although it has not been completely loaded, yet. It is explained here a hrefhttpflowplayer.orgpluginsstreamingpseudostreaming.html relnofollowhttpflowplayer.orgpluginsstreamingpseudostreaming.htmla and the site also has a link to the source code of a custom c IHttpHandler implementation that works nicely as managed handler in IIS7 integrated mode.p  pNow while this is working, the FLVs are transmitted with maximum speed which is not neededwanted. Usually the Bit Rate Throttling module for IIS7 a hrefhttpwww.iis.netdownloadBitRateThrottling relnofollowhttpwww.iis.netdownloadBitRateThrottlinga solves this.p  pBut in combination they do not work the handler takes over and the module does not kick in. Is there any configuration to combine these two techniques to limit bandwidth while pseudostreaming Or any other custom implementation to limit bit rates near to the high quality of the IIS BRT modulep  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 1704 pI am building an application which will perform 2 phases. p  ol liExecute Phase  First phase is very codeINSERTcode intensive as many inserts as the hardware can possibly can execute in a second.

Negative 1704 pIve got a problem trying to create a custom tableview cell for my iPhone app in Xcode 4.

Negative 1704 pI am building a webpage that has a few controls on it such as CheckBoxList and Listbox with multi selection enabled. These controls will be linked to a sql database table, one for colors and one for sizes. What is the best way to design the query, primarily the where statement to filter the shirts listed in a gridview that match the selected sizes and colors made by the user. For example, if the user checks red and blue from the colorsCheckBoxList and medium and large from the sizesListbox, then the gridview will display only shirts that are red and are in medium and large as well as shirts in blue that are in medium and large. Ive done most of the work, I just cant figure the best way to design the where clause. I can create it easily if I allow only one selection per control but Id prefer to allow multiselection. p  pThis is an .aspx page with code behind the page C.

Negative 1704 pI am using HttpClient by Apache to make one get call and two post calls to autozone.com. The get call is to access the homepage so that a JSessionId cookie is set. Then I am trying to search for stores around a certain zip code with their store locator and then set the first result as my Preferred Store.p  pI found out previously that all information about a user is stored server side and looked up using two permanent cookies. Basically just a usernamepassword pair. These cookies are being created along with the JSessionId because the first post, which requires the JSessionId, is working perfectly. I also found out that they also dont directly return the results page, instead they return just Http headers with a 302 Temporarily Moved status. So I retrieve the new page from the headers and go there.p  pThis is exactly what I see happening with my program. The get call to the homepage is loaded successfully and the 3 necessary cookies are set and I retrieve the dynamic session confirmation number that is necessary for all post calls. Then I do the post call to the processing page for the StoreLocator passing all the necessary arguments, get the location of the results, do a get call and load that page. I find the prefStoreNumber, the systems unique number to identify the store, and save it. Then I create my last post call. It goes to the correct page to process a preferred store selection. I again pass all the arguments that are in the form on the HTML page and the 302 response is returned. The problem arises when I get the new location. It should have, in the HTML, the store I just selected along the top bar, but instead it is still the same as if no store had ever been selected. I know that the cookies are being passed correctly or else I wouldnt have gotten the store results. p  pIm not sure why it isnt working so any ideas as to what might be happening are greatly appreciated. Ive included my code in case I am just missing something that is necessary, but I have checked over it a thousand times and can not find anything wrong. And I used WireShark to see if the post was being created correctly and it was.p  precode    String useragent, homepage, locatorPage, host, sessionConf, results, preferedPage     homepage  autozone     locatorPage  autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorMain.jspDARGSautozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorSearch.jsp     preferedPage  autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorMain.jspDARGSautozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorResults.jsp     useragent  Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 5.1 AppleWebKit535.1 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome14.0.835.202 Safari535.1     host  httpwww.autozone.com     DefaultHttpClient client  new DefaultHttpClient     client.getParams.setBooleanParameterhttp.protocol.allowcircularredirects, true     client.getParams.setParameterCoreProtocolPNames.USERAGENT, useragent      HttpContext session  new BasicHttpContext     HttpGet get  new HttpGethosthomepage     get.setHeaderUserAgent, useragent     HttpEntity e  client.executeget, session.getEntity     sessionConf  getHTMLValuedynSessConf, EntityUtils.toStringe     EntityUtils.consumee      HttpPost post  new HttpPosthostlocatorPage     ListltNameValuePairgt form  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairdyncharset, ISO88591     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairdynSessConf, sessionConf     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.successURL, autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorMain.jsptargetPagestoreLocatorResults     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.successURL,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.errorURL, autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorMain.jsptargetPagenull     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.errorURL,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePaircity,      form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDcity,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairstate, 1     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairzip, Integer.toStringzip     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDzip,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairareaCode,      form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDareaCode,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.findNearestLocations, submit     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.findNearestLocations,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDARGS, autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorSearch.jsp     post.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntityform, UTF8     HttpResponse response  client.executepost, session     results  response.getFirstHeaderLocation.toString.substring10     EntityUtils.consumeresponse.getEntity      get  new HttpGetresults     response  client.executeget, session     e  response.getEntity     String storeID  getHTMLValueprefStoreNumber, EntityUtils.toStringe     EntityUtils.consumee      post  new HttpPosthostpreferedPage     form  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairdyncharset, ISO88591     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairdynSessConf, sessionConf     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.preferedStoreSuccessURL, autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorMain.jsptargetPagestoreLocatorResults     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.preferedStoreSuccessURL,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.errorURL, autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorMain.jsptargetPagestoreLocatorResults     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.errorURL,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairprefStoreNumber, storeID     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.setPreferedStore, submit     form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDautozonediystorelocatorStoreLocatorFormHandler.setPreferedStore,       form.addnew BasicNameValuePairDARGS, autozonestorelocatorstoreLocatorResults.jsp     post.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntityform, UTF8     response  client.executepost, session     displayResponseresponse     results  response.getFirstHeaderLocation.toString.substring10     EntityUtils.consumeresponse.getEntity      get  new HttpGetresults     response  client.executeget, session     displayResponseresponse codepre  pThe displayResponse is just for debugging.

Negative 1704 pFirst off, here is what is emworkingem, and then Ill describe what is not  Using SWIG, we have taken some third party code, and created the Java and C wrapper source.  A jar file of the Java classes, and a shared library of the C wrapper code was created.  We have a Java codebase that loads the shared library, and is able to invoke the native code as needed.  This is running on Sun HostSpot JVM 1.5.0.14. No worries here.p  pNow, this is emnot workingem  Using the same JVM, jar file with of the Java wrapper code, and same shared library described above, I am trying to use Jython to do some scripting.  The CLASSPATH and LDLIBRARYPATH environment vars are set correctly.  From Jython, I am able to run java.lang.System.loadLibrary..., and load the shared library without error.  However, when the first native method from this library that is invoked for a Java object in my Jython script, I get an strongUnsatisfiedLinkErrorstrong from the JVM.p  pI ran nm on the shared library, and I see that the method in question is present in the library with the name mangling for native methods as described in the JNI spec.  So, the question is, what could be stopping the JVM from resolving the method namep  pIve been through the JNI spec, and I see that a library can be unloaded by the GC.  Could that be happening before I invoke the method  What else can cause this to failp

Negative 1704 pI have a contentEditable div element.

This means my p tag has 2 text nodes as siblings. Google Chrome and Opera dont do this. This extra text node creates an issue with my undoredo system. This undo system saves the caret position as an array of node offsets. The contents of the contentEditable div are saved and restored using innerHTML. However when the contents are restored via this method only a single text node is created, where Firefox previously had 2, causing an error. Im wondering if this behaviour creating the extra text node is intentional in Firefox, or if it perhaps a bug. Any suggestions or advice much appreciated. p

Negative 1704 pI am wondering if there is a simple way to create chartsgraphs within Mongodb, php and javascript.  I want to be able to display graphs on my website of the data in my mongodb using PHP andor javascript.  p  pFor example lets say i had a mongodb with a collection called sales and i want to display the average sales in a graph group by month.  p  pI am assuming i would have to use some sort of mapreduce to group the data then somehow  display it in a graph on my page using php andor javascript.  p  pI dont have any idea how to do this because i am new to mongodb.  Can someone please point me in the right directions  Also i would love if there was some sort of plugin, framework, library or api to accomplish this time saver.  If not, i dont mind learning how to code all of this if someone can just point me in the right direction books, websites, videos, resources, etc..p  pThank you.p
Negative 1704 pI have a pg table like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE orderstatushistory  orderid integer NOT NULL, status character varying NOT NULL, sequence integer DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL, datestatus timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now NOT NULL, recordstate character varying12 DEFAULT ACTIVEcharacter varying NOT NULL  codepre  pwith composite PK on orderid and sequence. Essentially the status column is an autoincrement value starting at 1, for each individual orderid. So, if orderid 2 already has two rows, the sequences would be 1 and 2, and for a new row, the sequence should be 3. Im trying to use a trigger to implement this behaviour before insert, but when I try to insert the first row for a new orderid i.e. trigger doesnt have to change the row prior to insert, Im getting an error for PG. saying that it cannot insert NULL into sequence. I cant see how my trigger function would be returning NULL, but my plsql is not great so im sure its something simple... Trigger function below, thanks.p  precodeDECLARE     seqno INTEGER  BEGIN     SELECT INTO seqno MAXsequence FROM rar.orderstatushistory WHERE orderid  NEW.orderid     IF FOUND THEN          NEW.sequence  seqno  1     END IF      RETURN NEW END codepre

However, for a few, everything gets wonky.  The text always seems to stay aligned in the center, but the icons tend to get pushed off to the left, sometimes at zerox, sometimes somewhere between zero and center.p  pThe icons are mostly of different sizes, but all fit nicely within the buttons with plenty of room to spare for the text. If I use the text for one of the misaligned buttons in a button that does align nicely, it will misalign.  If text from an aligned button goes with an icon from a misaligned one, it will usually align, but not always. It seems to be some combination of the icon size and text size, but I cant see anything wrong with any of them. p  pIs there a more proper way of setting these insets to make this workp  pIve been tweaking and playing with this for hours, and I cannot for the life of me figure out whats going on.

It seemed like a perhaps sneaky way of doing it would be to start B at 1 and increment Before by 1 every time a [ ]valued sublist is encountered since encountering [ ] means that the the head has been removed and now were starting over with just the tail, and once you have Before, After would just be [the length of the input list]  Before  [the length of the sublist]. Unfortunately, I am at a complete loss as to how I might go about incrementing Before.  Any thoughts Thanks so much p

When I explored the code a bit more I realized that there is no way to set the classloader for the HBaseConfiguration although it would be possible to set the classloader for a simple hadoopConfiguration, HBaseConfiguration inherits from, but the creation procedure of HBaseConfiguration does not allow it, as it simply creates a new object within the create method.p  pI really hope you have some idea how to get this up and running p

MEF is used to resolve dependencies  and load pluggable parts.p  pEach module consists of controllers, views, and other objects phisically its one assembly.

And application is running on one AppDomain default one.p  pHowever, if we would like to do configuration where different tenants use different module versions, we encounter problem with loading the same assembly in different version.

Negative 1704 pSo I have a framework weve built on codeigniter.  It uses regular codeigniter sessions by default which allows up to 4kb storage encrypted on a cookie.p  pIts for general apps that require a registration process, which can vary in size as questions are generated dynamically through an admin panel.  Registration process relies on session data as it redirects throughout process.p  pI have used dbsessions in the past when I knew this would be an issue on the framework, however, Im now considering the possibility to always have registration process using dbsession and the rest of the site use the 4kb cookie session.  p  pIs this possible.  It seems like it could be a really bad idea, but I dont really want to rework the dynamic registration process or really use dbsession for whole site as it will eventually make the site run very slow if too many users are online at once.p  pso Im think I can just set the variable in config to be true only when the registration controller is loadedby checking the url via SERVER or the uri helper if I can load it in the config which Im guessing I cant.p  pDoes this seem plausiblep

Negative 1704 pMost programers agree for avoiding DAO pattern when using JPA entities. Indeed, as a simple POJO, any entity can be merely persistent using annotations.p  pHowever, in the case where conceptual domain objects are slightly different from physical domain objects reflecting database table, is it a good practice to use a Business Object representing conceptual model and delegate persisting operation to a data storage object Thus, Business Object would be exempt from JPA annotations because it would be now the responsibility of the data storage object.p  pWhat is the best practice to deal with some differences between conceptual and physical domain Should I introduce DAO pattern in order to convert each BO to data storage object and apply persisting operations on itp

Negative 1704 pIn order to draw decals Im currently making use of codeglPolygonOffset1,1code, this rids me of some ugly zfighting artifacts when Im drawing my decals by fudging the zbuffer values of the decal as if the decals polygons were closer to the camera.

Negative 1704 pThis is a general noob question about software design, so I apologise if it seems vague, but I would really appreciate the advice. Note the system described below is purely an example, not a specific product I have in mind.p  pI often have a need to combine the functionality of several libraries or utilities, written in different languages. For example, if I want to code a highperformance audio processing application for the desktop, I will write it in C  C. Then, I want to add a nice GUI. But I dont want to learn Qt. I like the look and feel of Adobe Air, and would like to use that. Later, I have a need to access a USB device. But the USB library I have only has an API in Java. How can I combine all these elements together, to take advantage of their relative strengthsp  pClearly, I cannot compile these various elements into one single executable. So I need to create and run them seperately, and give them a means to communicate. The most common way to do this seems to be using IPC Inter Process Communication, eg shared memory or sockets. I prefer the idea of sockets, as the programs could potentially run on seperate machines on a network.p  pSo I decide to create a local client  server system, with a custom API, to allow these elements to communicate. For example, the Air application will receive a message from the C application, telling it to update its UI. The USB application running in Java will use the sockets to stream audio from the USB hardware, into the C application.p  pMy question  is using local sockets in this way a typical way to design such a system Will the performance be much worse than a truly native application e.g. everything in Java or C, in a single executable  It also seems likely that such an approach would be prone to bugs, and difficult to maintainp  pI frequently find myself coming up against the limits of existing software libraries e.g. a graphics library with a pretty, flexible UI but no way to access lowlevel hardware, or a media library that can mix many audio streams, but has no support for video playback, and find it very frustrating. If anyone could advise the best way to combine arbitrary software libraries like this, I would really appreciate it.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1704 pemShort questionemp  precodefunction FooampFooParam  ...   FooampBar codepre  pHow to keep this code and make it work in PHP 5.4p  pemLonger descriptionemp  pI have quite a lot of PHP code in which I used a notation pattern from C  mark reference parameters at declaration emANDem function call. It makes code more readable and prevents mistakes when refactoring code. Now PHP from 5.4 reports this as unsupported calltime pass by reference, which I believe is incorrect according to php.net, the prohibition of this feature in 5.4 was meant against the caller changing semantics of function parameters. It clearly does not apply in this case.p  pI still see the code with amp at function declaration and call as more readable and want to use it. Is there any way how to make it work in PHP 5.4 If not, please feel free to add some reasoning which would convince me that this C practice is wrong and I should rewrite all the code so that it will be 5.4compatible.p  pemEditem I have read some eight or ten questions on similar topic and the difference is Im not asking how to fix code but how not to fix code. If there is really no way how to make it working, please state your oppinion on why is it decided to be this way or why I should prefer this new way of writing code which I think is worse than the old way.p

Template is instantiated only with wellknown limited set of implementation classes that define the actual behavior of container.p  pMain template implements common functions supported by all containers  codeIsEmptycode, codeGetCountcode, codeClearcode etc.p  pEach specific container specializes some functions that are supported only by it, e.g. codeSortcode for sorted container, codeoperator[Keyamp]code for key indexed container etc.p  pThe reason for such design is that class is replacement for several legacy handmade bicycle containers written by some prehistorics in early 90th. Idea is to replace old rotting implemenation with modern STLampBoost containers keeping old interface untouched as much as possible.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pSuch design leads to unpleasant situation when user tries to call unsupported function from some specialization. It compiles OK, but produces error on linking stage symbol not defined. Not very user friendly behavior.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  precode SortedItemContainer sc  sc.IsEmpty  OK  sc.Sort  OK   IndexedItemContainer ic  ic.IsEmpty  OK  ic.Sort  Compiles OK, but linking fails codepre  pOf course, it could be completely avoided by using inheritance instead of specialization but I dont like to produce a lot of classes with 13 functions. Would like to keep original design.p  pIs there possibility to turn it into compile stage error instead of link stage one I have a feeling that static assert could be used somehow.p  pTarget compiler for this code is VS2008, so practical solution must be C03 compatible and could use MS specific features.

Negative 1704 pIve been writing a lot of unit tests recently. Theres a scenario to which I cannot find a clean solution...p  pLets say you have a beast of a methodp  precodepublic void bigMethod       a lot of code goes in here  codepre  pTo make your life easier and your code cleaner youd usually decompose such a beast into smaller inner methodsp  precodepublic void bigMethod      a     b     c      etc.  codepre  pYou can test all of the inner methods a, b, c etc. independently. The problem is the bigMethod which should also be tested but the only thing its doing is chaining calls of some other methods and those have been thoroughly tested alreadyp  pHow do you approach such a scenario You cannot just leave bigMethod untested because you need to be sure that a, b and c are called in there IN PROPER ORDER. But writing a test for bigMethod will lead to a lot of DUPLICATION IN TESTS. And reducing this duplication there every time is a lot of hassle since youll be doing that OFTEN.p  pOne idea that comes to my mind isp  precodepublic void bigMethod      helperA.a     helperB.b     helperC.c      etc.  codepre  pIn this scenario you test every helper class and then make sure bigMethod calls them inOrder.

Negative 1704 h1Summaryh1  pIm working on a fairly straightforward 2D tower defense game for iOS.p  pSo far, Ive been using Core Graphics exclusively to handle rendering. There are no image files in the app at all yet. Ive been experiencing some significant performance issues doing relatively simple drawing, and Im looking for ideas as to how I can fix this, short of moving to OpenGL.p  h1Game Setuph1  pAt a high level, I have a Board class, which is a subclass of codeUIViewcode, to represent the game board. All other objects in the game towers, creeps, weapons, explosions, etc are also subclasses of codeUIViewcode, and are added as subviews to the Board when they are created.p  pI keep game state totally separate from view properties within the objects, and each objects state is updated in the main game loop fired by an codeNSTimercode at 60240 Hz, depending on the game speed setting. The game is totally playable without ever drawing, updating, or animating the views.p  pI handle view updates using a codeCADisplayLinkcode timer at the native refresh rate 60 Hz, which calls codesetNeedsDisplaycode on the board objects that need to have their view properties updated based on changes in the game state. All the objects on the board override codedrawRectcode to paint some pretty simple 2D shapes within their frame. So when a weapon, for example, is animated, it will redraw itself based on the weapons new state.p  h1Performance Issuesh1  pTesting on an iPhone 5, with about 2 dozen total game objects on the board, the frame rate drops significantly below 60 FPS the target frame rate, usually into the 1020 FPS range. With more action on the screen, it goes downhill from here. And on an iPhone 4, things are even worse.p  pUsing Instruments Ive determined that only roughly 5 of the CPU time is being spent on actually updating the game state  the vast majority of it is going towards rendering. Specifically, the codeCGContextDrawPathcode function which from my understanding is where the rasterization of vector paths is done is taking an enormous amount of CPU time. See the Instruments screenshot at the bottom for more details.p  pFrom some research on StackOverflow and other sites, it seems as though Core Graphics just isnt up to the task for what I need. Apparently, stroking vector paths is extremely expensive especially when drawing things that arent opaque and have some alpha value lt 1.0. Im almost certain OpenGL would solve my problems, but its pretty low level and Im not really excited to have to use it  it doesnt seem like it should be necessary for what Im doing here.p  h1The Questionh1  pstrongAre there any optimizations I should be looking at to try to get a smooth 60 FPS out of Core Graphicsstrong p  h2Some Ideas...h2  pSomeone suggested that I consider drawing all my objects onto a single codeCALayercode instead of having each object on its own codeCALayercode, but Im not convinced that this would help based on what Instruments is showing. p  pPersonally, I have a theory that using codeCGAffineTransformscode to do my animation i.e. draw the objects shapes in codedrawRectcode once, then do transforms to moverotateresize its layer in subsequent frames would solve my problem, since those are based directly on OpenGL. But I dont think it would be any easier to do that than just use OpenGL outright.p  h2Sample Codeh2  pTo give you a feel for the level of drawing Im doing, heres an example of the codedrawRectcode implementation for one of my weapon objects a beam fired from a tower.p  pemNote this beam can be retargeted and it crosses the entire board, so for simplicity its frame is the same dimensions as the board. However most other objects on the board have their frame set to the smallest circumscribed rectangle possible.emp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect      CGContextRef c  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext       Draw beam     CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColorc, [UIColor greenColor].CGColor     CGContextSetLineWidthc, self.width     CGContextMoveToPointc, self.origin.x, self.origin.y     CGPoint vector  [TDBoard vectorFromPointself.origin toPointself.destination]     double magnitude  sqrtpowself.board.frame.size.width, 2  powself.board.frame.size.height, 2     CGContextAddLineToPointc, self.origin.xmagnitudevector.x, self.origin.ymagnitudevector.y     CGContextStrokePathc   codepre  h2Instruments Runh2  pHeres a look at Instruments after letting the game run for a whilep  pemstrongThe codeTDGreenBeamcode class has the exact codedrawRectcode implementation shown above in the Sample Code section.emstrongp  pstronga hrefhttpcl.lyimage2b1y3512341dFull Size Screenshotastrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqSw3j.png altInstruments run of the game, with the heaviest stack trace expanded.p

My current attempt is to write the string representation out and then read it back in and call codeevaluatecode on it to recreate the map when Im ready to use it again.p  pThe problem Im having is that the codetoStringcode method of the map removes vital quotes from the values of the elements.

Negative 1704 pIf I have a set of random floats 0.0f  1.0f around a sphere or even on a 2D grid would work too, each of which only differ by about 0.1f from their neighbors, is there a way to transform these floats into, say Colors, each of whichs RGB values also only differ by about 0.1f from their neighbors in a way that has essentially equal possibility of getting any color so some colors arent biased over othersp  pThe method Im using is a hrefhttpfreespace.virgin.nethugo.eliasmodelsmlandsp.htm relnofollowthisa, where after each vertices final offset is complete I scale all of the offsets down to float values from 0.0 to 1.0, where these float values still reflect the initial distribution of values.

Negative 1704 pI am working on an iPad application where the user can place several editable text boxes on a canvas. Each text box should be able to be moved by dragging it around with one finger. The user can rotate the selected text box using two fingers.p  pI would like to have two layers. The upper layer would receive rotation gestures with two fingers. However, if the user touch the screen using only one finger, it should pass the touch event to a text box custom UIView on the lower layer. Is it possible to do thisp  pMy first attempt is to count the number of touches from codevoidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent eventcode and codevoidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent eventcode using code[touches count]code. If the number of touches is two, it performs the rotation. If it is a single touch, it would loop through all the text boxes and check if the touch is inside which text box, and perform the moving for that box.p  pIs there a better way to do this Is looping going to be a problem when there are a lot of text boxesp  pBy the way, Im new to stack overflow. Please tell me if my question is too vague or anything and Ill try to explain it more clearly.p  pThanks for your help.p

No equality constraints, and codemcode,codencode of codeAcode are both lt3. codeAcode,codelbcode and codeubcode change after each codetcode and codencode iteration.  Also Im more interested about the speed up I get with the time loop because codentcodecodeNcode, so removing the inner loop by formulating a larger problem will not help much.p

Obviously the robot will need to only move within the bounds of the grid.p

Im beginning to worry.p  pIf I put in a user name that I have entered into LDAP, with a password, it says that the test was successful.p  pActually, if I put anything at all into those boxes, it says that it is successful.p  pHowever, if I put something into the Service Account Password then the test is not successful  it says that the service account supplied has either an invalid user name or password.p  pSo the main question at this point is  how do I find out what the service account password isp  pAnd is the behaviour that Im getting to be expected Thanks Stevep  pCode for validating sign on includesp  precodePublic Shared Function ValidateUserByVal server As String, ByVal port As Integer, ByVal userBase As String, ByVal userName As String, ByVal password As String, ByVal bindUser As String, ByVal bindPassword As String As LdapValidatorResult             Dim retVal As New LdapValidatorResult             Dim conn As New Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapConnection             Try                  connect to the specificed server for user validation                 conn.Connectserver, port                  retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.Success                 Try                     now authenticate to we can then go on to see if the username specificed exists                     conn.BindbindUser, bindPassword                      construct the distinguished name to uniquely id the specified user                     Dim searchString As String  String.FormatCN0,1, userName, userBase                      look to see if the user attempting to login to aware exists                     Dim sResults As LdapSearchResults  conn.SearchsearchString, Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapConnection.SCOPESUB, Nothing, Nothing, False ampobjectClasscomputer                     If sResults.hasMore Then                          Try                              now validate the user with the password as the final check                             Dim userDN As String  sResults.next.DN                             conn.BinduserDN, password                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.Success                          Catch ex As Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException                             If ex.ResultCode  Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException.INVALIDCREDENTIALS Then                                 retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.InvalidUserNameOrPassword                             End If                             retVal.ExceptInfo  ex                         End Try                      Else                         retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.NonExistentUser                       End If                 Catch ex As Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException                     Select Case ex.ResultCode                         Case Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException.INVALIDCREDENTIALS                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.InvalidBindUserNameOrPassword                         Case Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException.CONNECTERROR                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.ServerDown                     End Select                      retVal.ExceptInfo  ex                 End Try              Catch ex As Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException                 Dim cause As System.Net.Sockets.SocketException  TryCastex.Cause, System.Net.Sockets.SocketException                 If cause IsNot Nothing Then                     Select Case cause.ErrorCode                         Case 1101                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.InvalidNameIp                         Case 1106                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.RefusedConnectionOnPort                         Case 10060                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.ServerDown                     End Select                 End If                 retVal.ExceptInfo  ex             End Try              Return retVal         End Function codepre

Negative 1704 pIve been searching for 4 hours already but I cant seem to find a solution to our problem.p  pstrongThe problem weve encounteredstrongbr We have a emCentOS Linux 6.4em server, running emVirtualmin 3.99.gplem. We have a Drupal website which we would like to move to this server, and as its a multidomain site, we will have to use codeFollowSymLinkscode. This has as I was told been disabled as some security flaws were discovered addressing this directive. Since then you would have to use codeSymLinksIfOwnerMatchcode. Now, Drupal has a lot of code.htaccesscode files hidden deep in the roots of this system, and as Im not sure how this new method will be supported, I wanted to ask some experts their opinion to the solution my colleague proposed.p  pstrongThe Proposed solutionstrongbr My colleague told me that it would probably work if Id wrote a simple shell script to edit all the .htaccess files in the root folder of the domain, which would replace all the codeFollowSymlinkscode with the codeSymLinksIfOwnerMatchcode. As Im not sure if this would fix this problem, I would like to ask your opinion on this.p  pstrongWhat weve triedstrongbr Weve tried to fix the configuration file from Apache to allow FollowSymLinks, but this did not work.

Negative 1704 pI am in a process of restructuring an existing application code. One of the requirements of this restructuring is that I need to store a thread specific variable which would be referred pretty often for both read and write. I would be having approximately 50 such threads. The thread specific variable would basically be a pointer to a structure. Here, I am not able to decide how exactly should I store this variable. Should I make it thread specific key which could be accessed by codepthreadgetspecificpthreadsetspecificcode But I came across some posts which say that calls to these are pretty slow. Then another approach could be of having a global structure which store all these thread specific pointers in either a sorted array to use binary search or a hash table of elements in keyvalue form. Key would be mostly constant threadid and value could be changed frequently. Again what would be the best approach here I know the fastest access to the required value would be to actually pass this pointer to each function and keep propagating it. But that would require a lot of code rewrite which I want to avoid. Thanks in advance for you response.p
Negative 1704 h1Current Situationh1  pIve currently got three divs. Lets call them codeLeftDivcode, codeCenterDivcode and codeRightDivcode. codeLeftDivcode and codeRightDivcode both contain an image that randomises every time the page gets reloaded, ie when you press F5, or visit a different page on my website. This is done using javascript. p  pVisiting different pages on my site is done with page IDs, likep  ul liHomepage is website.comindex.phpli liAbout page is website.comindex.phppageaboutli lietcli lietcli ul  pVisiting different pages basically only changes the content on my codeCenterDivcode which is obviously located in between the codeLeftDivcode and the codeRightDivcode. However, the background images also once again randomise. Which is probably because the page refreshes. p  h1Desired Situationh1  pWhat I basically want is those images to only randomise again when the visitor either refreshes or revisits the website all together like entering the webaddress in the browser again. What this most likely would require I believe is to not have the entire page refresh when a new page ID gets visisted, but rather only refresh the CenterDiv. So now we get to...p  h1The Questionh1  pIs there a way to accomplish this If so, how What methods are recommended to usep  pThanks in advance for your help. p

Im only concerned about the cells where the values are not the same, so in the example above cells C1 and D1 on Sheet 2 do not match the values on Sheet 1, so I want to either change the font or background.  At this point I dont care.  If I were just comparing these 4 cells I could do this easily enough.  But Ive actually got 160 rows and about 1000 columns of binary data, so I dont want to condition each cell individually.  What I cant figure out is how to conditionally format the entire sheet using a formula that references the current cell vs the current cell on the other sheet.  p

Negative 1704 pI am a java programmer trying to teach myself c.  Please cut me a little slack if I ask simple questions at first.  p  pI would like to understand how the structure dereference operator works.  Specifically, can anyone tell me what the following line of code does in explicit terms  p  precode    if elements[i]gttestarga, argb  codepre  ptestarga,argb is a Boolean function in the same class, and elements is a vector of instances of the element class.

But when I try to expose the underlying values of elements[i] or testarga,argb with the cout lines above, the compiler throws errors until I comment those lines out.  In java, I would be able to fiddle around with this until I found values of each that correspond with each other, and then I would understand the line of code.  But I do not know how to figure out what this line of code does in C.  Can anyone give me a clear explanation, preferably supported by a link or two to some references onlinep

Negative 1704 pSo, to explain my scenario I want to create an online finite state machinewebapp which is capable to visualize the automatonconcepts deterministic, nondeterministic and later on does some logic like minimizing and so on to help students comprehend these abstract concepts in a way of experimenting around.p  pSo for my views, I thought about JSPlumb as the way to go other recommendations are appreciated  but I cant find the option to resize the HTML5 Canvas in JSPlumb. For lets say automatons with 100 nodes, a 640x480 canvas wouldnt be very nice, so what it emshouldem be is, starting with a canvas of 640x480, clicking and dragging on the side of the canvas, the user could extend it to its needs. Sure about that, the previously drawn elements should keep their places.p  pSo, my question is Is it possible to do this with jsplumb or do I need to code it myself If I need to code it myself, any hints on where to start changing the jsplumb files would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 1704 pIm very new to programming, and Im working my way through an ObjectiveC tutorial. Im trying to get the hang of codeforcode loops. What Im doing is setting up a mutable array, then setting up a codeforcode loop to get the value in every 6th index of the array. Like the value at index 6, then 12, then 18, etc. I initialized the array, and added in A  Z into it as a tester. So, A lives at index 0, Z lives at index 25. This is the for loop I wrotep  precode   int j      for j  0 j lt [myArray count] j  6          NSString test  [myArray objectAtIndexj]         NSLog, test       codepre  pThe output in the log is an endless flow of As. Im getting a warning on the codej  6code expression, stating Expression result unused. Does anyone know why the above code is not working From what I can understand please bear with me, very new to programming this would appear to be a valid expression for the loop. Im failing to understand why it is not. Ive browsed through all the keyword questions on here, and couldnt find any similar situations. Because of that, Im assuming that there is probably something obvious Im doing wrong. Any insight is much appreciated.p

Negative 1704 pI have a need to be able to create the NSFetchedResultsController dynamically, and am curious if this is even possible. The basis for this is that I need to be able to fetch results based on a variable. To my understanding I would need multiple NSFRCs to handle the multiple requests it will be a UISegmentControl TableView. The problem being I dont know how many controllers I will need as it is variable depending on what my API returns.p  pIs there a better method for this, could I not just pass a variable to NSFRC as the predicatep  pLooking for best options to handle this.p  pAn example would bep  pI have 13 different status for jobs Open, On Hold, Cancelled, etc, fetching all jobs then running the filter would tremendously slow down the application returning  50K records.p  pSo my though was to fetch the status use the status as a predicate and then fetch from the API jobs of that status.p  pWhat is my best approachp

Negative 1704 pHeh, the title must sound dreadful and noobishp  pAnyway, Im working on a simple web game thats basically a labyrinth. To make a map I have to manually write coordinates of walls, and I thought itd speed up the development process greatly if Id make a map editor. The first thing that came to my mind was pythons tkinter generating a grid of combo boxes.p  pThe grid is generated fine, but I have problems with exporting the map. I think each combobox has to have an unique text variable and a way to check its coordinates. I thought Id solve both problems if Id set the variables name to its coordinates, but I dont think its working and I dont know how to access the values later on.

Negative 1704 pI used small window as a tooltip which shows now playing info in my application. Sure I set codeTopmost  Truecode in window declaration and when new song starts to play I do codetooltip.Showcode. The problem is when I have fullscreen application in focus game for example, code.Showcode call makes fullscreen window to became nonfullscreen, windowed, with border and top bar as if I press Alt  Enter and it looks like it loses focus also. So to restore fullscreen I need to click in window to focus it and press AltEnter manually. codeShowActivatedcode set to codeFalsecode already. So, I see three solutionsp  p1 Somehow make codeTopmostcode option to not cause to steal focus on code.Showcodep  p2 Use some workaround to make tooltip window always on top without codeTopmostcode option I dont need to popup tooltip over fullscreen application since it can be and probably will be drawed via D3D or OpenGLp  p3 Detect if system has fullscreen window in focus now and dont try to show tooltip.p  pI have no any clue how to fix behavior with any of this options, or maybe there is something more elegantp

Negative 1704 pi using qt5 and opencv to create an application that give a user inteface using qt and does the image processing part in opencv.....p  pso far my design isp  ol lii am displaying a video and some standard controls like buttons and checkboxes using qt main gui threadli lifor capturing image and processing it, i have created a worker class derived from QObject and moved it to a thread....li lithe function that is executed in the worker classWorkerprocess has a blocking while loop.....that constantly ul licaptures a frame from a video or a camerali lidoes some processing on itli liconverts from cvMat to QImageli liemit a signal to the main thread to display the QImageli ulli lialso in order to recieve user input i was using emitting signal from the main thread to the worker slotsli ol  pthe problem i faced was that the signal from the main thread never got picked off by the worker because of the event loop blocking while loop. p  pafter much searching i came up with the solution to use QtDirectConnection argument while connecting the signal from the main thread to the worker slots. that solved the problem at that time.p  pnow i need to add a qtimer or qbasictimer inside the blocking while loop....and guess what, the timer slotin the case of qtimer and the protected timerEvent handler in the case of the qbasictimer never get called. my hunch is that again the blocking while loop is the culpritp  pafter much searching and reading on forums i have come to the conclusion that somehow my over all design maybe incorrect.....and as i keep adding more functionality to my application these problems will keep showing up.p  pI have two options nowp  ol lipsomehow call the threads exec function inside the blocking while loop. so the question to the gurus out there is how do i call the threadexec method inside a worker QObject class, i need the reference to the thread running the worker to call exec short term solutionpli lipchange the whole implementation.....and here the questions is what are my options..... long termpli ol  pplease feel free to ask for details in case my wording or english has made the problem unclear in any way.....thanks...p

Negative 1704 pI have the following issuep  pI have a primary view object that inherits from UIView that displays a grid of 16 squares each is a class I created that inherits from UIImageView, in a 4x4 layout.p  pEach of these 16 squares is 160x160, and contains an image a different image for each square that is no bigger than 30kb. The image, however, is 500x500 because it is used elsewhere in the program, in its full size, so it gets resized in the square class to 160x160, by the setFrame method.p  pBy looking at the memory management feature of Xcode when the app is running, Ive noticed a few thingsp  ol lieach of these squares, when added to the primary view object, increase the memory usage of the app by 1MB. This doesnt happen at instantiation, but only when they are added by [self addSubviewsquare] at the primary view object.li liif I use the same image for all the squares, the memory increase is minimal. If I initialize the square objects without any images, then the increase is basically zero.li lithe same app, when running in the simulator, uses 16 of the memory it does on an actual device.li ol  pThe whole point here is why is each of the squares using up 1MB of memory when loading a 30kb image Is there a way to reduce this Ive tried creating the images in a number of different ways code[UIImage imageNamedimg]code, code[UIImage imageWithContentsFromFilepath]code, code[UIImage imageWithDataimgData scalescale]code, as well as not resizing the frame.p

Negative 1704 pstrongHey therestrongp  pIm in the middle of redesigning my a hrefhttpnicholasdumais.comtest relnofollowsitea and I have a bunch of svgcss animations that break outside of chrome and I cant figure out why.p  pIt seems to have something to do with handling multiple nested animations and transformorigins theyre not handling them.p  pI checked compatibility  good, if browsers handle origins differently  nope.p  pI dont have enough rep to post the appropriate linkstoo many and code too long  but if you could inspect the site Id be extremely grateful.p  pThank you in advance for any effort put into this.p  pstrongEDITstrong fixed test case a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenKJlkb relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpenKJlkbap  pstrongANSWERstrong Firefox does not support percentages for objects Im not certain, but it seems to only affect path and g elements.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrong Animate using pixels instead of percentages.  Use transform origin as if it were relevant to the SVGs viewBox dimensions instead of the objects dimensions.p  pThanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1038015robertlongsonRobert Longsona for setting me on the right path.

Negative 1704 pWhats the best data structure for storing an unknown amount of values then removing many p  pIm reading a file and each line is stored as a C string in some larger data structure. Each line is probably less than 20 characters long and one example file has 300000 lines. Whatever data structures Im going to use will only grow in size at its initial creation from there it will only shrink in size. What would I use In Java I would use Array List or maybe Vector. Could a dynamic array work and if yes how would it look likep  precodechar aLine[21] char data  mallocaLine fp  fopendatafile, r iffp NULL     exitEXITFAILURE whilefscanffp, 20s, aLine  1      data  aLine     reallocdata, sizeofdatasizeofaLine  codepre  pI want to use standard C and POSIX features so if having lists means usings a third party library I dont think thats an option.p  pEDIT well creating a linked list isnt exactly trivial, whats the second best optionp

Negative 1704 pI am a fan of both Glassfish and MOXy, and its good news for me that MOXy had been bundled into Glassfish v4. p  pI had read and tried a few of MOXy examples on the internet, I like the dynamic OXMMETADATASOURCE part, since while providing RESTful services, the client perspective is very flexible than domain classes.p  pSo here is the problemp  pDifferent RESTful services can have different views from same domain classes, and in my work its very common case. So there can be a lot of binding OXM metadata files for every service. And as we know a single OXM metadata file can only correspond to a single java package. So there will be much more OXM metadata files to maintain. p  pBack to JAXRS, Is there any framework to design patterns or best practices to finish the mapping between OXM metadata file set and the service itselfp

Negative 1704 pThis is a memoryallocation related question in C. I have a number lets say 5 2dimensional arrays of floats. Each of the arrays is 60x60.p  pTheoretically, this information represents static data that is not going to be changed after it is initially calculated. p  pShould this be stored as a static size array or is this big enough for being allocated dynamically I suppose I am unclear about the size of the stack and if declarations such as codearr [60][60]code will be stored exclusively in the codeDATAcode section. Does this depend on the machine or on the code itself Since stack memory usually corresponds to high level cache, what is the size limit for this on, lets say Intel i5 line of machinesp  pI understand that this is very broad question, so I will gladly take references to credible background sources.p

Negative 1704 pIm working with Laravel 4 and trying to setup a table structure for handling the following problem.  p  ul liI have 3 tables Players, Teams amp Seasonsli liFor each season, I will have multiple teams assigned and each team will have multiple players assigned.li liI need to maintain historical data for each season, so I cant just connect the tables directly because changing the base playerteams tables would affect all seasons that way.li ul  pI connected the Seasons  Teams table by using an intermediate table codeteamsinseasoncode as followsp  precodeclass Season extends Eloquent      public function teams              return thisgtbelongsToManyTeam, teamsinseason       codepre  pThat works as expected.  The issue comes when I want to setup the player assignment.  Naturally, I want to relate the teams to players so my line of thinking is that I need to create an intermediate table off of another intermediate table.  Exp  pcodeseasons gt teamsinseason gt playersinteams gt playerscodep  pIf I went Seasons  Players, that would work except that I wouldnt be able to eager load it that way.p  pcodeseasons gt playersinseason gt playerscodep  precodeseasongtteamsgtplayersgtget codepre  pEssentially, the way the user enters data is to create a season, assign teams, assign players to teams, and then eventually add scoring.

As one link suggested by S.O. that I followed stated, emUnfortunately, GridBagLayout is infernally awkward and errorprone to useem. No argument here.p  p2 Spending enough time struggling with Netbeans was worth it, in that, without it, it was almost impossible to read textbooks and tutorials and get anything close to desired outcome YMMV. p  p3 strongThe code Netbeans generates in GridBagLayout mode is MUCH closer to humanwritten codestrong than the usual incomprehensible hundreds of lines of emkrazy kodeem that it generates in free design mode, which is virtually impossible to follow, let alone cut, paste, and edit though Ive had minimal success doing so. Never again.p  p4 The generated GridBagLayout code is reasonably easy to cut, paste, and edit to generate the desired outcome given that it was in the ballpark to begin with, and ignoring ample frustration with its quirks.p  pMost importantly for ME, I finally feel free from Netbeans and may be on the way to developing some skill at writing GUI code from scratch, something Ive avoided like the plague for monthsp

Negative 1704 pLets say I have a Google account codesome.accountgmail.comcode with project codeproject1code configured as Google App Engine application in Google Developer Console and a service account with email address code12..developer.gserviceaccount.comcode that belong to it.p  pI know how to use this service account to create a calendar and manipulate its entries programmatically I use the a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogleapijavaclientGoogle APIs Client Librarya Java version, with service accounts credentials to invoke Google Calendar API inside my Google App Engine application and it does just that. However any such created calendars seem to be distinctly owned by the service account, not by my englobing Google account. I conclude this from the following observationsp  ul liWhen I view my Google accounts calendar in the a hrefhttpswww.google.comcalendarGoogle Calendar UIa, none of the programmatically created calendars show up under codeMy calendarscode.li liWhen I try to access such a calendar by issuing codeOther calendarscode  codeAdd a friends calendarcode and with the service accounts emailaddress, I can send off the request, but it never gets answered presumably because the service accounts email address isnt a real email address.li liWhen Im creating calendars programmatically, I dont set codeCalendarListEntryhiddencode, so the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma188295141789384default codefalsecodea should apply.li ul  pSo my question is this How can I access calendars and calendar entries that were created programmatically with Google Calendar API and a Java client in my case in the normal Google Calendar Web UI. E.g., can the service account share its calendars with its owning Google account, or can I directly manipulate the Google accounts calendars with its service account credentials in the UI.p  pI realize there are some previous questions on the same topic, but they havent helped to solve the mystery for me so far.p

Negative 1704 pI have three applications running on a beefy machine at the same time 32GB memory and 32 CPUs. The three applications have to run in parallel. Two of these applications are C applications and they are IO intensive they are constantly writing a large amount of data to the disk. The third application is a java application which basically reads the files written by the first two applications and write different files. I can run each application smoothly without problems but when I try to run the three together, it seems that CPU usage of the first applications are high and the CPU usage for the third application shows as 0. I am using Ubuntu linux. I am trying to give equal process priority to these applications. Any idea what the problem isp

Negative 1704 pOktalist gave a great answer below, check it out and the comments under it, to help demonstrate everything weve discussed, Ive added a full, compiling solution at the bottom of my question that demonstrates everything discussed.p  pI have a collection of namespace global methods and templated methods like the followingp  precodenamespace PrettyPrint      String tostringbool val     String tostringchar val     String tostringint val     String tostringuint val      ETC...      template lttypename Tgt String tostringconst T val              if  val return UNULL         return String.copyformattedpgt S, const voidval, tostringval.uchars            ... and more templates to help with containers and such  codepre  pThe String type is not the C string, its a special class derived off of IBMs ICU library, but not really relevant for this question.  Point is, I have a bunch of namespace global methods called tostring and also some templated functions that override them.  So far, so good, everything works great.  But, now I have another header where I have something like the following definedp  precodenamespace User       struct Service          int code         String name          ...  namespace PrettyPrint      String tostringconst UserServiceamp val  return val.name   codepre  pSo, now I have defined some other type somewhere else, and Ive also defined another tostring override in my PrettyPrint namespace to indicate how to convert my new type to a String.  Toss both headers into a file, something like thisp  precodeinclude ltthe tostring and templates headergt include ltthe UserService headergt  main      UserService s  1, Ufoo     UserService p  amps     PrettyPrinttostrings     PrettyPrinttostringp  codepre  pYes, the tostring methods should actually be returning a value somewhere, not the point. The point is that the second call gives a compiler error gcc, btw saying that in the templated tostring method there is no matching function for call to tostringconst UserServiceamp, which ofcourse exactly matches my method that is defined and included. If I reverse the include ordering it works just fine.p  pSo, I surmise that the template is only looking at methods defined ahead of it.  Is there any fix for this  Given the scope of my project and number of complicated includes, simply saying always make sure they come in the right order is not a tractable solution, and would introduce too much complicated fragility in the code.  The base tostring defintions is one of those files that will tend to get included high up in a lot of places, so making sure that any other random type definitions that happen to include a tostring override come first just isnt going to work.p  pThe other solution I have that works in some places is that Ive defined a Printable interface in the base filep  precodenamespace PrettyPrint      class Printable      public         virtual String prettyprinttostring const  0           String tostringconst Printableamp obj  return obj.prettyprinttostring   codepre  pThat definition comes before the template methods in the same file.  So, that works great for classes where I can simply add in that interface and implement it.

Negative 1704 pI understand that this is an odd question, but I have this situationp  pI serve an apk directly from a site, this apk has a codeWebViewcode inside of it which will open a secure part of a website.p  pI would like to track down those who download it, and those who then open it, so I have thought of thisp  pI compile the apk with the URL written in this way or in a similar one p  pwww.myserver.comsecretplacelanding.phptokenp  pthen, just before a user downloads it, I change those  characters with a token created on the fly and store in the database, when the user opens the apk, I can check the token and recognize that that was the user that downloaded the apk at that specific moment.

Negative 1704 pI am a Chrome for Business and Education admin for a fleet of chromebooks which I have configured to run in a hrefhttpssupport.google.comchromeaanswer3316168hlen relnofollowSingle App Kiosk modea. The kiosk app in question is really simple. All I did was take a hrefhttpssupport.google.comchromeaanswer3316168hlenkiosk relnofollowthe example code from this pagea that uses the webview tag without controls, as we need all the whole screen for the app in question and change the URL. The app has installed perfectly in all managed devices.p  pThe problem now is that there are times when we want to be able to exit the kiosk app and return to the chromebook login screen. Right now the only way of doing this is to shut the machine down, start it and exit from the kiosk app boot screen by pressing CtrlAltS. The whole process takes 30 seconds plus per machine the fleet contains 50. So we really need to be able to just quit out of the kiosk app and go back to the login screen which would take about 5 seconds or less.p  pNow, I could just add a quit button to the screen as per the second example app with navigation controls from the page referenced above but this means we lose screen space for the app. The preferred solution is to close the app with keystrokes e.g. CtrlShiftL. But how do you do this emin this contextem I have tried adding conventional onkeydown javascript to the page containing the webview tag and this seems to be ignored. I have also tried using the chrome commands API, and whilst I can see that the shortcut had been registered against the extension by clicking Keyboard shortcuts on the chromeextensions tab it has no effect. The kiosk app window remains stubbornly open. p  pDoes anyone know if this is possible and if so howp  pCheers,p  pMilesp

It can be anywhere from at the cursor to 2 characters in front. Another problem with this approach is that emsometimesem I think when the cursor is ematem the location of the period replacing the period with a space causes the system to lock up, with the underlying control replacing the space with a period, my code replacing that with a space, and back and forth adinfinitum.p  pThe best outcome for this question is that theres just a simple property I can set somewhere, and I wasted an hour messing around with this.

Negative 1704 pI am having problems accesing the session after upgrading a web project to .net 4.5p  pfirstly, I had a functional .net 3.5 web forms project which I upgraded to .net 4.5 on my dev machine.

Negative 1704 pSubstantial update below October 15, 2014p  p Original posting p  pI have a notification service webapp using Atmosphere and Jersey. I am trying to run it in Tomcat on Linux, and have run into a problem. Note that this works fine when running in TomcatembeddedwithinEclipse, so its possible its a Tomcat configuration problem.p  pThe problem is that broadcast messages seem to be queued up, or buffered, and are not actually delivered to the client until I shut down Tomcat. At that point they are all received by the client at once. p  pI have tried a number of things that I found in various postings to try to solve this, but my efforts are scattershot because I dont know what is causing the problem p  ul liI have tried explicitly using Tomcats NIO protocol. li liI have tried explicitly disabling text and binary buffering, and I have also queued up enough responses to trigger a flush if buffering were the cause. li liI tried running in Tomcat 8 instead but that had different unrelated problems. li liI have added the atmosphereruntimenative, atmospherecompatjbossweb, and atmospherecompattomcat dependencies. li ul  pNone of these has changed the behavior of the service. And, again, it seems to work fine when running in Eclipse.p  pEnvironment Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Tomcat 7.0.54. Atmosphere 2.1.5. For a client, Im just using telnet at the moment.p  pThis code is a bit more complicated than the samples because I have a number of different routes I want to support, and Im using the method proposed by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma22330794279130thisa answer, which seems to be working nicely. Also Im returning notification objects rather than Strings. This also seems to be working fine.

After updating the project with a new version of Atmosphere 2.2.3, I find no difference in behavior. It is still the case that, when running the service on a different computer than the client is running on, the atmosphere broadcasts are not received by the client until Tomcat shuts down. When running the client and the service on the same computer, everything works as expected.p  pSo, to determine where the problem lies, I have started just using one of the Atmosphere sample apps in my testing. I am using the jerseypubsub sample app with minor updates to get it to compile, because thats the one thats closest to what Im trying to do. I have created a brand new server environment to run the sample app, to minimize any variables based on Linux configuration. Here are the new steps  maybe someone can replicate the behavior.p  pTo get a new server with Tomcat7 installed Im using Vagrant and VirtualBox for these testsp  precodehost vagrant init ubuntutrusty64 host nano Vagrantfile codepre  pchange network config to a known IP   codeconfig.vm.network privatenetwork, ip 10.1.1.2codep  precodehost vagrant box add httpsvagrantcloud.comubuntuboxestrusty64versions1providersvirtualbox.box host vagrant up  vagrant sudo aptget update vagrant sudo aptget upgrade vagrant sudo aptget install tomcat7 codepre  pFollowing these steps, I ended up with Tomcat 7.0.52, and Ubuntu 14.04p  pI have a copy of just the jerseypubsub project without parent project etc. that I build usingp  precodehost mvn clean install codepre  pand then deploy by p  precodehost cp targetjerseypubsub.war ....vagrantstrusty64 vagrant sudo cp vagrantjerseypubsub.war varlibtomcat7webapps codepre  pI can then test this using telnet, for examplep  precodehost telnet 10.1.1.2 8080 ltreturngt GET jerseypubsubpubsubfoo HTTP1.0 ltreturngt ltreturngt codepre  pAt this point, telnet continues to wait for data. In the tomcat server log, I can see an entryp  precode203355.805 [httpbio8080exec1] INFO  o.a.samples.pubsub.EventsLogger  onSuspend 10.1.1.159357 codepre  pI then send a POST request to the server. Im using POSTman for this, but I dont think it matters.p  precodePOST http10.1.1.28080jerseypubsubpubsubfoo Accept texthtml ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded message lthtmlgtltbodygtltpgtThis is a testltpgtltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pIn the server log I can see that the server believes it broadcast the messagep  precode203406.990 [AtmosphereSharedAsyncOp0] INFO  o.a.samples.pubsub.EventsLogger  onBroadcast lthtmlgtltbodygtltpgtThis is a testltpgtltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pbut nothing shows up in the telnet client. I can repeat ad infinitum and see no result, until I shut down Tomcat, at which point all of the broadcast messages are received by Telnet immediately.p  pIn contrast, if I deploy the service on a tomcat instance running on the host machine, or if I run telnet within the vagrant instance, everything works as expectedp  precodevagrant telnet localhost 8080 ltreturngt GET jerseypubsubpubsubfoo HTTP1.0 ltreturngt ltreturngt codepre  pIf I then send the same POST request, I immediately receive the broadcast message in telnet.

Negative 1704 pI am finally confused with a problem related to the Android GridViews. I am sorry for a little bit long description,  but I have not a lot of time to optimize my question.p  pHere is what I want to get. There should be a GridView with 8x10 elements. Each element has an initially generated random color from 5 supported color set. I have used Android View type for an element and just set a background color.p  pEvery time when user clicks on an element it should be deleted and all the elements above it should be moved down to fill the vacant space.

Negative 1704 pI am creating a photo slide show with complex transitions between images on iOS. Core Animation doesnt suits the purpose as the possible transitions are limited, so I resort to Opengles 2.0. The problem is uploading images to GPU and creating texture is a time consuming operation amp takes roughly 200 ms even for a 960x640 image, which is not suitable for real time playback scenario. And its not feasible to precreate all the textures before hand as there could be 100s of them. I wonder how Core Animation deals with this problem and is smooth enough to run no matter how many CGImages you assign in animations  As long as images are presented at different times and not together.p

Negative 1704 pIm using Highcharts.js to render a bunch of charts to some divs that are jqueryUI draggables. In Chrome, this works perfectly fine. However, in Internet Explorer tested in 11, but maybe in other versions too, there are some scaling issues. The script that renders the charts runs different settings based on browser, so I can mess with the IE part by itself without messing up the Chrome part. This is how it emshouldem look and how it does in Chromep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtnufB.png altenter image description herep  pEverything is nicely spaced, and I didnt have to set any spacing options. This is how it looks in IE11. I added some margins to the plot itself, because it was originally rendering outside of the div entirelyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkh5ut.png altenter image description herep  pThe scaling issues and misplacement of the yaxis labels I can deal with, thats easy to change. My issue is the legend. In Chrome, I set no specific options for the legend and I was fine. Apparently that doesnt work for IE. I cant find any documentation or help on why this is happening. All of the items are present, and you can still click on them for normal behavior. They are all just stuck on one line like that.p  pHas anyone encountered this issue beforehave any ideas to fix it I tried a whole bunch of options for the legend in the chart settings, but other than being able to move it around while still stuck on one line I cant affect it.p  pcode sample HTMLp  precodeltdiv iddropwrapgt ltdiv iddockgt     ltdiv iddockheadgtAvailable Cardsltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag1gt10 Year Historyltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag2 styletop180pxgtPremiumltbrgtPie Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag3 styletop230pxgtLossltbrgtPie Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag4 styletop280pxgtPremiumltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag5 styletop330pxgtLossltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag6 styletop380pxgtLoss RatioltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idexpandgt     ltdiv idhlpmsg styletextweight bold fontsize 150 position absolute top 350px left 500pxgtDrag cards here to expand themltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pJSp  precodefunction areachartgenchtype, item  console.logitem drag4.highcharts     chart          type area,         backgroundColor 57CF57,         borderColor 000,         borderRadius 10px,         marginBottom 150,         marginLeft 70,         marginTop 40     ,     legend          floating true,         itemStyle              lineHeight 20px         ,         maxHeight 150,         labelFormatter function               return this.name         ,         layout vertical     ,     title          text 10 Year   chtype   History     ,     subtitle                  text Source lta hrefhttpthebulletin.metapress.comcontentc4120650912x74k7fulltext.pdfgt                      thebulletin.metapress.comltagt             ,     xAxis          allowDecimals false,         labels              formatter function                   return this.value  clean, unformatted number for year                           ,     yAxis          title              text chtype         ,         labels              formatter function                   if chtype  Loss Ratio                      return this.value                    else                      return   this.value  1000  k                              ,             labels                  overflow justify                           ,     tooltip          pointFormat series.name point.y,         valueDecimals 2     ,     plotOptions          area              pointStart 1940,             marker                  enabled false,                 symbol circle,                 radius 2,                 states                      hover                          enabled true                                                   ,             stacking normal              ,     colors [         6FF299, 5A90D6, E39220, D17BC6, 8085e9,         f15c80, e4d354, 8085e8, 8d4653, 91e8e1],     series [         name Casualty,         data [             [2004, 360902.0],             [2005, 371489.0],             [2006, 398748.0],             [2007, 416682.0],             [2008, 413205.0],             [2009, 374988.0],             [2010, 400701.0],             [2011, 483902.0],             [2012, 447391.0],             [2013, 456503.0]         ]     ,          name Engineering,         data [             [2004, 0.0],             [2005, 0.0],             [2006, 0.0],             [2007, 0.0],             [2008, 0.0],             [2009, 0.0],             [2010, 0.0],             [2011, 0.0],             [2012, 0.0],             [2013, 0.0]         ]     ,          name Ocean Marine,         data [             [2004, 0.0],             [2005, 180000.0],             [2006, 234395.0],             [2007, 248322.0],             [2008, 262216.0],             [2009, 248754.0],             [2010, 274888.0],             [2011, 289781.0],             [2012, 340459.0],             [2013, 405247.0]         ]     ,          name Property,         data [             [2004, 285354.0],             [2005, 365038.0],             [2006, 395420.0],             [2007, 554621.0],             [2008, 685197.0],             [2009, 630535.0],             [2010, 613608.0],             [2011, 643399.0],             [2012, 704345.32],             [2013, 822684.93]         ]     ]  item.resize codepre  pp  pHere is a link to the fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdLL8cw7s5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdLL8cw7s5ap  pOddly, everything works perfectly fine in the fiddle, even in IE.

Negative 1704 pIs there a general set of rules to achieve a certain number by multiplying a known and unknown number. e.g. Suppose x  13 and z  9p  pIs there a way to find y such that p  precode    x  y  z      gt 13  y  9 codepre  pI dont want to utilize them as mathematical integers, but rather in terms of bits. So, I want to keep z an int. Obviously, there is an overflow in the bit representation, but Im unsure how to find z without brute forcing all values in a 32bit machine. I think y would be a very small number, negative.p  pNote this isnt or a hw assignment, so you could change x and y to whatever, these are just examples.p

Negative 1704 pSo in the current age of Software Engineering, code reuse is so important that modern languages have some form of dependency management. Dartlang achieves this through the use of Pub. However, pub has taken the approach of using shared dependencies, meaning that if 2 or more libraries have a common dependency, that dependency will be downloaded once and the libraries share it... This of course has led to a very strongvexingstrong problem.p  pThis is something that happens extremely often. You are working on a project that requires n1 libraries. It is fairly common for some of the libraries to have the same dependency. It is also very likely that they depend on strongDIFFERENTstrong versions of said dependency. It is so bad, that pub had to give you the option to override dependencies. Youd think that one would maybe just use the latest version of said library, but code is always in flux so different versions tend to have breaking changes...p  pPub tries to work out a compromise itself, but it usually just gives up saying it cant do it, leaving you to manually try something with the overrides mentioned above. Often times you spend more time trying to mix and match versions of your libraries till you get a pair that will seemingly play nice with each other. It is also strongemextremely vexingemstrong when an update was pushed to one library that fixes a bug that was affecting your project, but you dont want to update because that would change the needed versions of the shared dependency and thus would break your other libraries . p  pA good example of this crap is with Polymer and Angular. I know that their code is still in flux, but I can tell you that alot of people would love to use them both together Polymer and Angular a two independent projects and it would be very unreasonable to expect their respective communities to make sure that all their versions remain compatible with each other.p  pI come from a Java background. Java does not have built in dependency management. However, the community made two projects that are more or less industry needed if you want to make a large java project. They are Maven and ivy. Why this problem doesnt exist over on their side is because they decided that each dependency should be isolated from the others. If pub were to also take that approach, this problem would disappear over nightp  pSorry for the rant, but right now I am asking, is there a way to make pub behave more like Maven or Ivy If not, is there a thirdparty dependency manager that does samep

Negative 1704 pI am implementing a custom auditing framework, logging ETL events such as start, end, error, insertrows etc.p  pAs well as logging at a package level, Im implementing session logging where a sequence of package executions, i.e. a controller package that executes several packages, is a session. In order to keep track of the session, the stored procedures always return a SessionLogID.p  pI was hoping I could map this result set to a project parameter as otherwise, I will have to save it to a user var and then pass it around between packages via parameters. This will mean every single package will have a Package Parameter and User Variable called SessionLogID. I dont want to do this if I dont need to.p  pOpen to other suggestions.p  pThanks, Adamp

Negative 1704 pMy question deals with opening an sqllite helper connection on phone boot. Basically I have a receiver which on boot,launches and intent service which opens an sqllite connection and performs some tasks on certain records. Let us assume that while this intent service is performing its tasks, the user launches the app. Now this user via an activity also opens emanotherem database connection and begins modifying some records. What will happen in this casep  pI read from another question, that one of the two will fail.  So I want to know if there is anyway to pass on the already instantiated database connection to the application on launch, i.e get the connection from the intentservice. Or is there some better method to do this Thanks in advance.p
Negative 1704 pGiven a base string and a set of strings, how to find the sequence of stringsmay not include all that match the most of the base string p  pFor example, if the base string is abcdabc and the set is bcdab, abc, bcd, b, d, the sequence abc, bcd will match most number of characters in the  base string.p  pNote that chars once matched in the base string are removed and cannot be used for further matching.p  pIf the solution sequence is bcdab , the  base string that remains after the match is ac, which cannot be matched with any of the remaining strings in the set.p  pIf the solutions sequence is abc, bcd , the base string that remains after the matching with abc is abcd  there are two matches, but the suffix match yields optimal solution. After matching with bcd, the base string that remains is just a. p  pAfter considering all the sequences, it can be seen that abc, bcd does the maximum matching. p  pI thought that a little variation of 01 knapsack problems solution can be used but the bookkeeping of the larger string gets messy. p

Negative 1704 pI am attempting to write a pass which would eliminate phi nodes in llvm IR. Although I have converted the llvm IR to CSSA form I am not sure how to actually remove the phi nodes. From a broader perspective, I want to do RA directly from LLVM IR. The only option I can think of is to have the SSA deconstruction pass as an analysis pass and then while doing code generation, use the information from this pass to insert the necessary movs.  Is that the only option or is there any other way whereby we can move out of SSA form with IR.p

Negative 1704 pI have a MySQL database that contains over 100 tables. This database is used by a CMS and every  6 hours, a PHP script uses all these tables with a lot of logic, calculations and SQL joins and generates a large dataset with over 1 million rows and inserts it into a table that we call deals. This is basically a table with 50 columns and a lot of optimized indexes and each row has the same stuff, something like thisp  pdealid, price, productname, productcolor, productdimensions, onstock, brand, etc.p  pThis deals table is then used by many other front and backend applications for all kinds of purposes. Examples are a page on which a customer can filter and then see results. A page on which a customer can find information about a deal. An XML feed that is used by affiliates that contains all products of brand X  150,000 rows from the 1,000,000 rows table. An iOS app that is used to show you what kind of accessoires there are available for your iPhone. All these applications use the same 1,000,000 row MySQL table to easily find and display data.p  pThese applications are experiencing speed issues as the deals table grows. MySQL seems to have a lot of trouble handling these kind of numbers. I would not expect that to be the case but perhaps having only one MySQL server with 32GB RAM and 8 cores is a problem. Its not an option to upgrade to a couple of servers with 128GB RAM and also Im not really convinced that this would actually solve the problem.p  pIve made a little PHP script that, besides insert the 1,000,000 rows into MySQL, also indexes them in elasticsearch. Then, I tested both the MySQL table and the ES index in a simple sandbox filtering application. The speed of the ES based application was absolutely amazing compared to the MySQL based application. So it looks like speedwise, ES wins. p  pSo.. is this the right usage of an ES instance Or am I incorrect thinking ES would be the best solution for my MySQL speed issue p

The other sessions withing 105 minutes  span should be hidden so the next available session will at either 10AMp  precodeltcfloop indexii fromstartHour toendHourgt ltcfloop indexjj from0 to60locbtwMinute steplocbtwMinutegt     ltcfset showtimeygt     ltcfset time  createtimeii, jj, 0gt          ltcfloop queryqAssignedSessionsgt              ltcfset preSessionStart  dateaddn,locBtwSpanbuffertime,sessionstartgt             ltcfset postSessionend  dateaddn,bufferTime,sessionendgt              ltcfif hourtime gt hourpreSessionStart or hourtime eq hourpreSessionStart and minutetime gt minutepreSessionStart                                         and hourtime lt hourpostSessionend or hourtime eq hourpostSessionend and minutetime lt minutepostSessionendgt                                     ltcfset showtimengt                                 ltcfifgt                             ltcfloopgt                              ltcfif datecomparearguments.startDt,latestSessionDate eq 1 and hourtime eq 20 and minutetime eq 00 or hourtime lt 20                                     or datecomparearguments.startDt,latestSessionDate eq 0 and hourtime eq 20 and minutetime eq 00 or hourtime lt 20 and hourtime gt hournow                                                                              and showtime eq ygt                                 ltoption valueltcfoutputgttimeformattime, HHmmltcfoutputgtgtltcfoutputgttimeformattime, hhmm ttltcfoutputgtltoptiongt                             ltcfifgt                         ltcfloopgt                     ltcfloopgt codepre

Negative 1704 pI have been struggling for a couple of days with an issue in Flash CS4. I am restructuring an old game project into a Main class which handles the mainMenu, playGame, etc. functions. I have a ship added from the game, which is added by Main.p  pThe issue is myShip works as expected, except its never visible. Ive checked a lot of times, and both myShip and its containter game visible properties are always true. Alpha values are not the problem either, nor layers nor depth. Every other child Ive added from game works just fine, but myShip refuses to be visible.p  pAny ideas as to why this could happen I do not know how what to try next to solve the problem. Any help would be very appreciated. The code for the Main, Game and Ship class is below.p  pThank youp  pCode from the Main classp  precodepublic class Main extends Sprite      public var mainMenuDisplayMainMenuDisplay     public var gameGame     public var gameOverMenuGameOverMenu     public function Main          showMainMenu          public function showMainMenu          mainMenuDisplay  new MainMenuDisplaythis         gameOverMenuremovemovieclipgameOverMenu         addChildmainMenuDisplay          public function showGameOver          gameOverMenu  new GameOverMenuthis         gameremovemovieclipgame         addChildgameOverMenu          public function playTheGame          game  new Gamethis         mainMenuDisplay  removemovieclipmainMenuDisplay         gameOverMenuremovemovieclipgameOverMenu         stage.addChildgame          private function removemovieclipclip          if clip              removeChildclip                  return null       codepre  pCode from the Game class package  p  precodeimport flash.display.MovieClip import flash.display.Stage  import flash.events.Event import flash.utils.Timer import flash.events.TimerEvent  import com.coreyoneil.collision.CollisionList  import flash.text.TextField import flash.text.TextFormat  import flash.events.MouseEvent  import com.greensock. import flash.display.Sprite import flash.display.SpreadMethod import flash.display.GradientType import flash.geom.Matrix  import com.sounds.music.MusicmainMusic import flash.events.KeyboardEvent import flash.ui.Keyboard  import flash.display.DisplayObject  public class Game extends MovieClip        var mainClassMain      Main menu     var mainMenuDisplayMainMenuDisplay  new MainMenuDisplay     static var inMenuBoolean  true          Ship variables     static var myShipShip  new Ship     var myDirectionBarDirectionbar  new Directionbar          Enemy variables     static var enemyShipTimer1Timer          PowerUp variables     static var powerUpTimerTimer     static var nukingBoolean          Wall generation variables     static var wallmovspeedNumber     var randomizeNumber  1     var wallArrayArray  new Array     var indexint  0          Wall collision variables powered by CDK by Corey ONeil     var myWallCollisionListCollisionList   new CollisionListmyShip     var wallcollisionsArray  new Array          Score variables     static var scoreNumber     static var scoreTextTextField  new TextField     var scoreFormat  new TextFormatLCD5x8H, 20, 0x0066FF, true     var distancescorecounterint          Health variables     static var healthMeter1HealthMeter  new HealthMeter           Game modes     var levelSelectDisplayLevelSelectDisplay  new LevelSelectDisplay     NOTE These are extremely important, because they are the functions, which in reality are attributes, that allow us to call,     from an Event Listener, a function in which we have a parameter to pass.

Negative 1704 pAfter spending a few hours reading the Http Client documentation and source code I have decided that I should definitely ask for help here.p  pI have a load balancer server using a roundrobin algorithm somewhat like thisp  pcode                          gt RESTServer1  client gt load balancer gt RESTServer2                          gt RESTServer3 codep  pOur client is using HttpClient to direct requests to our load balancer server, which in turn roundrobins the requests to the corresponding RESTServer.p  pNow, Apache HttpClient creates, by default, a hrefhttphc.apache.orghttpcomponentsclientgahttpclientapidocsorgapachehttpimplconnPoolingHttpClientConnectionManager.html relnofollowa pool of connectionsa 2 per route by default. This connections are by default persistent connections since I am using Http v1.1 and my servers are emitting Connection KeepAlive headers.p  pSo, the problems is that since HttpClient creates this persistent connections, then those connections are no longer subject to roundrobing algorithm at the balancer level. They always hit the same server every time. p  pThis creates two problems p  ol liI can see that sometimes one or more of the balanced servers are overloaded with traffic, whereas one ore more of the other servers are idle and li lieven if I take one of my REST servers out of the balancer, it stills receives requests while the persistent connections are alive.li ol  pDefinitely this is not the intended behavior.p  pI suppose I could force a codeConnection closecode header in my responses, or I could run HttpClient without a connection pool or with a a hrefhttphc.apache.orghttpcomponentscoregahttpcoreapidocsorgapachehttpConnectionReuseStrategy.htmlisexternaltrue relnofollowNoConnectionReuseStrategya. But a hrefhttpshc.apache.orghttpcomponentsclientgatutorialhtmlconnmgmt.html relnofollowthe documentationa for HttpClient states that the idea behind the use of a pool is to improve performance by avoiding having to open a socket every time and doing all the TPC handshaking and related stuff. So, I have to conclude that the use of a connection pool is beneficial to the performance of my applications.p  pSo my question here, is there a way to use persistent connections with a loadbalancer in the way or am I forced to use nonpersistent connections for this scenario p  pI want the performance that comes with reusing connections, but I want them properly loadbalanced. Any thoughts on how I can configure this scenario with Apache Http Client if at all possiblep

Negative 1704 pI am fairly new to c and try to implement an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEntitycomponentsystem relnofollowentitycomponentsystem ECSa.p  pI have an inferface codeIComponentcode and a baseclass called codeComponentcode that implements the inferface. The baseclass codeComponentcode has many subclasses e.g codePositionComponentcode, codeVelocityComponentcode, etc..p  pI would like every subclass of codeComponentcode to have its own static list of instances of that class. For example codePositionComponentcode should have a static list of all instances of codePositionComponentcode.p  pBecause I do not want to copy the same code in every subclass I put the list in the baseclass codeComponentcode. But because it is static the subclasses wouldnt get an own instance of it but instead use the list in the baseclass.p  pWhile trying to solve this I stumbled upon the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCuriouslyrecurringtemplatepattern relnofollowcuriously recurring template pattern CRTPa to implement some form of static polymorphism.p  pMy problem now is that when I call destroy on an object of type codePositionComponentcode I get the following error in the last line of codeComponentdestroycode where I try to assign codethiscode to codepFirstInPoolcode p  precodeinvalid conversion from ComponentltPositionComponentgt const to PositionComponent codepre  pCan this be fixed or is what I am trying to do simply not possible the way I designed itp  pHere is the codep  pbIComponentbp  precodeclass IComponent      public         virtual IComponent          virtual void destroy  0     protected         IComponent      private  codepre  pbComponentbp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class Component  public IComponent      public         virtual Component           inline Entity getEntity  return pEntity           static T create               returns an object from the list of inactive objects the pool              or returns a new object if the pool is empty.             then it adds it to the list of active objects              T lpNew             if  pFirstInPool  nullptr                   lpNew  new T             else                 lpNew  pFirstInPool                 if  lpNewgtgetNext  nullptr                       lpNewgtgetNextgtsetPrevnullptr                     pFirstInPool  lpNewgtgetNext                 else                     pFirstInPool  nullptr                                           if  pFirst  nullptr                   pFirstgtsetPrevlpNew             else                 pLast  lpNew                          lpNewgtsetNextpFirst             lpNewgtsetPrevnullptr             pFirst  lpNew             return lpNew                   void destroy               removes an object from the list of active objects             and adds it to the list of inactive objects the pool              if  this  pFirst                   pFirst  pNext                          if  this  pLast                   pLast  pPrev                          if  pPrev  nullptr                   pPrevgtsetNextpNext                          if  pNext  nullptr                   pNextgtsetPrevpPrev                          pPrev  nullptr             pNext  pFirstInPool             pFirstInPool  this                   inline T getPrev  return pPrev          inline T getNext  return pNext          inline void setPrev T tpPrev   pPrev  tpPrev          inline void setNext T tpNext   pNext  tpNext           static inline T getFirst  return pFirst          static inline T getLast  return pLast       protected         Component  lEnabledtrue, pPrevnullptr, pNextnullptr       private         Entity pEntity         bool lEnabled         T pPrev         T pNext         static T pFirst         static T pLast         static T pFirstInPool    template lttypename Tgt T ComponentltTgtpFirst  nullptr template lttypename Tgt T ComponentltTgtpLast  nullptr template lttypename Tgt T ComponentltTgtpFirstInPool  nullptr codepre  pbPositionComponentbp  precodeclass PositionComponent  public ComponentltPositionComponentgt      public         PositionComponent         ...     protected     private  codepre  pbVelocityComponentbp  precodeclass VelocityComponent  public ComponentltVelocityComponentgt      public         VelocityComponent         ...     protected     private  codepre

Negative 1704 pIve spent hours trying to figure out what is happening to my selecteditem property of my ComboBoxes and Im pretty sure I know what is causing the problem now, but I just dont understand why this is happening and if there is something I can do about it. p  pBasically I have a DataGrid with comboboxes in the headers that I use for filtering the DataGrid items. The DataGrid sits in a Tabcontrol and if I select items in the comboxes and switch tab and back the selected items are removed. p  pThis happens only when the ItemsSource of the Comboboxes have the IsAsync property set to True. Otherwise everything works just like I want it to.p  pTo give some more info about the logic The comboboxes get their values from a IValueConverter its the same converter for all comboboxes and I pass a ConverterParameter to tell it what to return. The collection sent to the converter is the items shown in the datagrid.  These values are refreshed each item has selected parameters updated, the collection is not cleared and recreated when the tab is activated. p  pThis my xaml for one of the comboboxesp  precode ltComboBox SelectedItemBinding MadeBy ItemsSourceBinding IssuesView,ConverterStaticResource DataGridFilterableValueConverter,ConverterParameterMadeby, IsAsynctrue SelectionChangedFilterComboBoxSelectionChangedgt codepre  pNow, like i described previously, if I set the IsAsync to false the selecteditems stay. p  pDo I just have to live with this We work alot with sqldatabases and IsAsync really makes the interface alot more snappy. I can live without it in the comboboxes, but I tend to use it as much as I can. p  pIve seen that ppl have been having problems with the selecteditem and the general solution seems to be placing the SelectedItem before the ItemsSource, but this does not help. p  pThanksp  pErikp  pEdit 1 Here is the xaml of the tabcontrol and tabitem.p  precodeltTabControl Grid.Row1 xNameTabControl SelectionChangedTabControlSelectionChangedgt            ltTabItem HeaderGranskningssynpunkter xNameIssueTabgt codepre  p.....

Negative 1704 pI have an app which tracks scores for board games. It has three main viewsp  ol liList of games  codeUITableViewcodeli liGrid of scores  codeUIScrollViewcodeli liCalculator to enter scores  codeUIViewcodeli ol  pOn the iPhone, these are arranged in a navigation controllerp  ol liList of games, user picks a game, which pushesli liGrid of scores, user picks a score, which pushesli liCalculatorli ol  pOn the iPad, the grid and calculator are both visible at once, while the list of games is a drop down that appears as needed.p  pWhat Im wondering is the best way to reuse logic between the two modes. Pushing a button on the calcuator does the same thing on iPhoneiPad, but moving the score back to the grid and when to update the grid are different. The wrong way is to put all the code in the view controllers and copypaste it. Whats the right way It seems like I could use protocols to put the common code in a separate class and have each controller serve as a delegate to that class, but perhaps theres something betterp

Negative 1704 pI am running into an issue where SQL Server is causing a significant number of locks 95 to 150 on our main table.  They are typically short duration locks, lasting under 3 seconds, but I would like to eliminate those if I possibly can.  We have also noticed that typically there are no blocks, but occasionally we have a situation where the blocks seem to cascade and then the entire system slows down considerably.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pWe have up to 600 virtual machines processing data and we loaded a table in SQL so we could monitor any records that got stalled and records that were marked complete.  We typically have between 200,000 and 1,000,000 records in this table during our processing.p  pstrongWhat we are trying to accomplishstrongp  pWe are attempting to get the next available record Status  0.  However, since there can be multiple hits on the stored proc simultaneously, we are trying to make sure each VM gets a unique record.  This is important because processing takes between 1.5 and 2.5 minutes per record and we want to make this as clean as possible.  p  pstrongOur thought process to this pointstrongp  precodeUPDATE TOP 1 dbo.Test WITH ROWLOCK SET Status  1,      VMID  VMID,      ReadCount  ReadCount  1,     ProcessDT  GETUTCDATE OUTPUT INSERTED.RowID INTO retValue WHERE Status  0 codepre  pThis update was causing us a few issues with locks, so we reworked the process a little bit and changed the where to a subquery to return the top 1 RowID primary key from the table.  This seemed to help things run a little bit smoother, but then we occasionally get overloaded in the database again.p  precodeUPDATE TOP 1 dbo.Test WITH ROWLOCK SET Status  1,      VMID  VMID,      ReadCount  ReadCount  1,     ProcessDT  GETUTCDATE OUTPUT INSERTED.RowID INTO retValue  WHERE Status  0 WHERE RowID IN SELECT TOP 1 RowID FROM do.Test WHERE Status  0 ORDER BY RowID codepre  pWe discovered that having a significant number of Status 1 and 2 records int he table causes slowdowns.  We figured it was from a table scan on the Status column.  We added the following index but it did not help solve the locks.p  precodeCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IXTestStatusRowID ON [dbo].[Test] [Status] INCLUDE [RowID] codepre  pThe final step after the UPDATE, we use the RowID returned to select out the detailsp  precodeSELECT Test as FileName, , Nick as [Nickname]  FROM Test WITH NOLOCK WHERE RowID IN SELECT id from retValue codepre  pstrongTypes of locksstrongp  pThe majority of the blocks are LCKMU and LCKMS, which I would expect with that UPDATE and SELECT query.  We did have 1 or 2 LCKMX locks as well occasionally.  That made me think we may still be getting collisions on our unique record code.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liAre these locks and the number of locks just normal SQL operations for this type loadli liIs the subquery causing more issues than a TOP1 in the UPDATE we started with  I am trying to get confirmation I can remove the ORDER BY statement and remove that extra step of processing.li liWould a different index help  I wondered if the index updating was a possible cause of the locks initially, but now I am not sure.li liIs there a better or more efficient way to get a unique RowIDli liIs the WITH ROWLOCK causing more locks than leaving it off would cause  The idea is ROWLOCK would only lock the 1 specific record and allow another proc to update another record and select without locking the table or page.li liDoes anyone have any tools they recommend to stress test and run 100 queries simultaneously in order to test any potential solutions  li ol  pSorry for all the questions, just  trying to make sure I am as clear as possible on our process and the questions we have.  p  pThanks in advance for any insight as this is a really frustrating issue for us.  p  pstrongHardwarestrongp  pWe are running SQL Server 2008 R2 on a Dual Xeon CPU with 24 GB of RAM.

Negative 1704 pApologies if this question is a duplicate or if it has an obvious answer that Im missing p  pIs there a practice or pattern that involves a web service returning a function definition to the client, instead of a value or objectp  pFor an extra rough outlining example p  pIm interested in the results of some statistical model. I have a dataset of 100,000 objects of class ClientSideClass.p  pThe statistical model sits on a server, where it has to have constant access to a large database and be recalibratedreestimated frequently.p  pThe statistical model takes some mathematical form, like RESULT  functionClientSideClass  AemX  BemY  anotherFunctionListZp  pThe service in question takes requests that have a ClientSideClass object, performs the calculation using the most recent statistical model, and then returns a result object of class ModelResultClass.p  pIn pseudo OOP again, sorry for the gnarly example p  pMy program as a client p  precodestatic void main      assume that this assignment is meaningful and that all        the objects in allTheThings have the same identifying kerjigger     SomeIdentifier id  new SomeIdentifierkerjigger    ClientSideClass[100000] allTheThings  GrabThoseThingsid     for ClientSideClass c  allTheThings        ModelResult mr  Service.ServerSideMethodc        more interesting things      codepre  pWith my client side class  p  precodeClientSideClass     SomeIdentifier ID     int A     double[] B     HashTableltString,SomeSimpleClassgt SomeHash   codepre  pOn the server, my main service  p  precodeService     HashTableltSomeIdentifier,ModelClassgt currentModels      ModelClass GetCurrentModelSomeIdentifier id         return currentModels.getid         ModelResultClass ServerSideMethodClientSideClass clientObject         ModelClass mc  GetCurrentModelclientObject.ID        return mc.CalculateclientObject       ModelClass     FormulaClass ModelFormula      ModelResultClass CalculateClientSideClass clientObject          apply formula to client object in whatever way        ModelResult mr  ModelFormula.ExecuteclientObject        return mr        FormulaClass       no idea what this would look like, just assume          that it is mutable and can change when the model          is updated     ModelResultClass ExecuteclientObject       do whatever operations on the client object         to get the forecast result           this method is mutable, it could change in         functional form andor parameter values      return someResult      codepre  pThis form results in a lot of network chatter, and it seems like it could make parallel processing problematic because theres a potential bottleneck in the number of requests the server can process simultaneously andor how blocking those calls might be.p  pIn a contrasting form, instead of returning a result object, could the service return a function specification Im thinking along the lines of a Lisp macro or an F quotation or something. Those could be sent back to the client as simple text and then processed clientside, rightp  pSo the ModelClass would instead look something like this p  precodeModelClass     FormulaClass ModelFormula     String FunctionSpecification          some algorithm to transform the current model form            to a recognizable textformatted form        string myFuncForm  FeelTheFunc       return myFuncForm      codepre  pAnd the ServerSideMethod might look like this p  precodeString ServerSideMethodSomeIdentifier id     ModelClass mc  GetCurrentModelid    return mc.FunctionSpecification  codepre  pAs a client, I guess I would call the new service like this p  precodestatic void main      assume that this assignment is meaningful and that all        the objects in allTheThings have the same identifier     SomeIdentifier id  new SomeIdentifierkerjigger    ClientSideClass[100000] allTheThings  GrabThoseThingsid     string functionSpec  Service.ServerSideMethodid    for ClientSideClass c  allTheThings         ModelResult mr  SomeExecutionFramework.ExecutefunctionSpec, c      codepre  pThis seems like an improvement in terms of cutting the network bottleneck, but it should also be readily modified so that it could be sped up by simply throwing threads at it.p  pIs this approach reasonable Are there existing resources or frameworks that do this sort of thing or does anyone have experience with it Specifically, Im very interested in a usecase where an interpretable function can be utilized in a large web service thats written in an OO language i.e. Java or C.p  pI would be interested in specific implementation suggestions e.g. use Clojure with a Java service or F with a CWCF service but Id also be stoked on any general advice or insight.p

Negative 1704 pTo improve further implementation and to offer some guidelines and keep everything as universal as possible within the project Ive created an Interface with a few methods which should be used. However only one method of this class should be visible to the user calling that class so Id like them to be of the protected variety. E.gp  precodepublic class ClassThree      public ClassThree              var classOne  new ClassOne         class1.MethodOne       codepre  pThis despite ClassOne having 4 methods, 3 methods are used only within the one public class, hence private or protected. These 3 methods are required to make the 4th method work however in an ideal world other developers would follow the same principle. So I dont want to see the following pop up on intellisensep  precodeclass1.MethodTwo class1.MethodThree class1.MethodFour codepre  pI know one can implicitly call methods from an Interface e.gp  precodeIInterface.MethodTwoltType,Typegtstring name    Do stuff here  codepre  pHowever I would like to prevent all the casting when calling said methods in ClassOne itself since this is just a thorn in my eye. I like my code clean and this isnt clean at all to me. Ive thought of an abstract class however my class is inheriting from another class. With the interface I could just dop  precodepublic ClassOne  ClassTwo, IInterfaceltType1,Type2gt codepre  pWhen I do that with an Abstract class however Visual Studio says an interface is expected. Any insights are most welcome and appreciated as I would like to up my code by making my life and that of fellow developers, who have to use my code, easier.p  pThanks in advancep  pEdit The scenario is there can be several classes like ClassOne which essentially do the same however they use different types since the objects they have to return hold different values. However the buildup to these objects are more or less the same e.gp  ol liCollect all API datali liRetrieve the list to be exported to the API and call 3 or 4 depending on the type.li liExport Type 1 to the APIli liExport Type 2 to the APIli ol  pThe idea is always the same but naturally different APIs will require different variables. But to ensure all steps are followed as before Id like to implement an Interface or something but step 1,2 and 3 should be private or protected and only step 2 should be available to the class that consumed it. However if I only put method 2 in the interface I can never be sure that others will implement 1,3 amp 4. And thats kind of the goal here P. This while ClassOne also inherits from another class and not just the interface.p  pEdit 2 I know Interfaces only provide public methods which is why Im looking for alternatives hence this question. I know what is wrong with it I just dont really see how I can get it the way I would like it to be. Thanks for the replies so farp  pEdit 3 Interface currently looks like this, I just adjusted variable names for sake of example.p  precode   public interface IExportltin T, in TUgt              void GetRequiredApiData          bool MethodOneListltTypegt list          bool ExportOneT one          bool ExportTwoTU two          bool ValidateExport      codepre

Negative 1704 pAre there any SQL Server Replication Best Practices   Are there any links I can read up onbr Im using 2012 and 2014.  I want to know, in general, what type of database objects typically people replicate from the source instance publication to the target instance subscription  Table is definitely one of them. If there are a lot of views  associated with the source database and probably not being used in the replicated database targetsubscription, should I include them in the replication process  What about stored  procedures  In both cases, would it be better just to replicate the data and manually deploy the views and  stored procedures   Id like to get some ideassuggestions  Thanksp

However I felt that it wouldnt be as reliable as simply having a codeprevCursorMarkcode. p  pExample Code with PHP Solr Extension p  precode  queryresponse  clientgtquerysolrQuery    data  queryresponsegtgetResponse    nextCursorMark  data[nextCursorMark]    prevCursorMark  issetGET[nextResult]                     htmlspecialcharsGET[nextResult]     pager  lta hrefindex11ampnextResultprevCursorMark classpage5 noajaxgtPrevltagt             lta hrefindex11ampnextResultnextCursorMark classpage5 noajaxgtNextltagt codepre  pSo heres my question Does codeCursorscode in codeSolrcode provide a prevCursor Mark Is it possible to make a next and previous pagination with codeCursorscodep

Negative 1704 pIm confined to using only .Net 2.0 and trying to write something that will convert a byte to char.p  pIdeally I would use codeConvert.ToCharbuffer[i]code to get a char from a codebytecode in a codebyte[]code array but in .Net 2.0 this feature didnt exist.
