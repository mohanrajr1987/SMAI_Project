Positive 5852 pstrongFirst, some backgroundstrongp  pIm working on a project which requires me to simulate interactions between objects that can be thought of as polygons usually triangles or quadrilaterals, almost certainly fewer than seven sides, each side of which is composed of the radius of two circles with a variable and possibly zero number of rivers of various constant widths passing between them, and out of the polygon through some other side. As these rivers and circles and their widths and the positions of the circles are specified at runtime, one of these polygons with N sides and M rivers running through it can be completely described by an array of N2M pointers, each referring to the relevant riverscircles, starting from an arbitrary corner of the polygon and passing around in principal, since rivers cant overlap, they should be specifiable with less data, but in practice Im not sure how to implement that.p  pI was originally programming this in Python, but quickly found that for more complex arrangements performance was unacceptably slow. In porting this over to C chosen because of its portability and compatibility with SDL, which Im using to render the result once optimization is complete I am at somewhat of a loss as to how to deal with the polygon structure.p  pThe obvious thing to do is to make a class for them, but as C lacks even runtimesized arrays or multitype arrays, the only way to do this would be with a ludicrously cumbersome set of vectors describing the list of circles, rivers, and their relative placement, or else an even more cumbersome edge class of some kind. Rather than this, it seems like the better option is to use a much simpler, though still annoying, vector of void pointers, each pointing to the riverscircles as described above.p  pstrongNow, the questionstrongp  pIf I am correct, the proper way to handle the relevant memory allocations here with the minimum amount of confusion not saying much... is something like thisp  precodeint doStuffWithPolygons     stdvectorltstdvectorltVoid gtgt polygons     whilesome circles arent assigned a polygon         stdvectorltVoid gt polygon         void start  ampnext circle that has not yet been assigned a polygon         void lastcircle  start         void nextcircle         nextcircle  ampnext circle to put into the polygon         whilenextcircle  start             polygon.pushbacklastcircle             stdvectorltRiver gt rivers  list of rivers between last circle and next circle             forunsigned i  0 i lt rivers.size i                 polygon.pushbackrivers[i]             lastcircle  nextcircle             nextcircle  ampnext circle to put into the polygon         polygons.pushbackpolygon      int score  0     do whatever youre going to do to evaluate the polygons here     return score   int main     int bestscore  0     stdvectorltintgt bestarrangement contains position of each circle     stdvectorltintgt currentarrangement  whatever arbitrary starting arrangement is appropriate     whilenot done evaluating polygon configurations         fiddle with current arrangement a bit         int currentscore  doStuffWithPolygons         ifcurrentscore gt bestscore             bestscore  currentscore             bestarrangement  currentarrangement      somehow report what the best arrangement is      return 0  codepre  pIf I properly understand how this stuff is handled, I shouldnt need any delete or .clear calls because everything goes out of scope after the function call. Am I correct about this Also, is there any part of the above that is needlessly complex, or else is insufficiently complex Am I right in thinking that this is as simple as C will let me make it, or is there some way to avoid some of the roundabout constructionp  pAnd if youre response is going to be something like dont use void pointers or just make a polygon class, unless you can explain how it will make the problem strongsimplerstrong, save yourself the trouble. I am the only one who will ever see this code, so I dont care about adhering to best practices.

Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectorsp  pThe standard associative containers are typically implemented as balanced binary search trees. A balanced binary search tree is a data structure that is optimized for a mixed combination of insertions, erasures, and lookups. That is, its designed for applications that do some insertions, then some lookups, then maybe some more insertions, then perhaps some erasures, then a few more lookups, then more insertions or erasures, then more lookups, etc. The key characteristic of this sequence of events is that the insertions, erasures, and lookups are all mixed up. In general, theres no way to predict what the next operation on the tree will bep

Over the years the format of the XML file has been modified, and an update and versioning strategy has been adopted. The chosen strategy performs an update upon open whenever an old version is encountered. Thus far, updates have only consisted of rearranging data within the XML file or making database schema changes and moving data from the XML file to the database.p  pHaving quite a bit of background in OOP its easy for me to see that a project should be a self contained object which other objects interact with. However, I fail to see how to apply the chosen update strategy in OOP.p  pThe problem of implementing the chosen update strategy in OOP has kept me from using OOP as of yet. If anyone has experience with such a task, or recommendations on how to proceeded Id appreciate any assistance you can provide.p

Negative 5852 pAs far as I know theres no way to hint the c compiler to inline a particular function and I guess its like that by design.p  pI also think that not letting the programmer to specify what to inline and what not is generally a good idea, as it would imply that you think youre smarter than the JIT compiler my respects to those who actually are, but, what if I wanted to specify that a critical portion of code needs to be extremely fast at any cost, no matter how to achieve it on the target machine As of yet you cant do such a thing and I wonder if both the c language and the JIT will ever support this feature.p  pIn my case, I know what the target machine is, and I know that function inlining will help improve the performance. This leaves me thinking that the only way to enforce function inlining is getting to know under what circumstances the JIT will do it but I dont think thats a good idea either,p  pAny light on the subject would be much appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5852 pI am working on a Windows utility program which communicates with some custom hardware using a standard COM port. The communication protocol which is out of my control requires me to transmit and receive raw 8bit data bytes.p  pI am currently using the following Windows API function to send data to the COM portp  precodeWriteFilehFile, lpBuffer, numberOfBytesToWrite, ...codepre   pwhere codehFilecode is a reference to the properly opened COM port, and codelpBuffercode is an array of bytes that I have stored in memory. The code works perfectly until a null character ASCII zero needs to be sent to the device. codeWriteFilecode stops sending as soon as it detects the null character because it assumes that it has reached the end of the string. This happens even though I set codenumberOfBytesToWritecode properly.p  pHow can I send raw data to the COM port using the Windows API I would prefer to use a standard API call similar to codeWriteFilecode, but I am open to suggestions.p  pI am currently using a hrefhttprapidqwiki.altervista.org relnofollowRapidQa to build the utility, but all it does is call the Windows API function directly.p  pbEditb My setup consists of a Windows PC connected via serial port to the custom hardware module. The module has a small screen on which I am able to view the transmitted characters. I have tested this setup with another thirdparty utility program. I am able to communicate with the module using this third party program, and null characters show up properly. In my own program, when I use codeWriteFilecode, a null character anywhere in the transmit stream stops the rests of the stream from being sent.p

Negative 5852 pHeres my scenario.  I have an application written in C but not the complete source but the meat of it is there.  I also have a compiled exe of this application.  It communicates to a server somewhere here on our network.  I am trying to replicate the C code in java, however it uses dwords and memory references, sizeof etc, all things that dont exist in java since it manages its own memory.  It builds this large complex message and then fires it over the network.  So I am basically sniffing the traffic and inspecting the packet and trying to hardcode the data its sending over to see if I can get a response from the server this way.  However I cant seem to replicate the message perfectly.  Some of it, such as the license code it sends is in clear hex, that is, hex that translates into ascii, whereas some other portions of the data are not clear hex such as aa which does not translate into ascii or at least a common character set if that makes any sense Im not sure.p  pIdeally Id like to not do it like this, but its a stepping stone to see if can get the server to respond to me.  One of the functions is for the application to register itself and thats the one I am trying to replicate.  p  pSome of my assumptions above may be wrong, so I apologize in advance.  Thanks for your time.p

Its a private server so Im not shelling out for a real certificate so just ignore that.p  pIn Chrome, the browser I use, and Internet Explorer, the problem is visible.p  pThanks, problem solved with the accepted answer, but my question was also partly thisp  pWhen you see, in the animated gif, or if you tried it, the mouse moving upwards, I understand that a CSS hover style for the line makes that line higher. However, the bottom lines in the illustration should not move once I am hovering over one line, even if I move the mouse cursor to another line. Granted, the line I was on, and the line I moved to, should shift, depending on the direction, because one lost the 12 pixels, and the other one gained them, but the text lines in the bottom of the illustration should not really move, should they They should only move down 12 pixels when I move the mouse cursor into the list of lines to begin with, and only if I move it back out.p  pI just thought that particular behavior was rather odd.p

Negative 5852 pI need some expert advice on strong typed data sets in ADO.NET that are generated by the Visual Studio. Here are the details. Thank you in advance.p  ul lipI want to write a Ntier application where Presentation layer is in Cwindows forms, Business Layer is a Web service and Data Access Layer is SQL db.pli lipSo, I used Visual Studio 2005 for this and created 3 projects in a solution.pli lipproject 1 is the Data access layer. In this I have used visual studio data set generator to create a strong typed data set and table adapter to test I created this on the customers table in northwind.  The data set is called NorthWindDataSet and the table inside is CustomersTable.pli lipproject 2 has the web service which exposes only 1 method which is GetCustomersDataSet. This uses the project1 librarys table adapter to fill the data set and return it to the caller. To be able to use the NorthWindDataSet and table adapter, I added a reference to the project 1.pli lipproject 3 is a win forms app and this uses the web service as a reference and calls that service to get the data set.pli ul  pIn the process of building this application, in the PL, I added a reference to the DataSet generated above in the project 1 and in forms load I call the web service and assign the received DataSet from the web service to this dataset. But I get the errorp  blockquote   pCannot implicitly convert type   PL.WebServiceLayerReference.NorthwindDataSet   to BL.NorthwindDataSet eMy   DocumentsVisual Studio   2008ProjectsDataSetWebServiceExamplePLForm1.csp blockquote  pBoth the data sets are same but because I added references from different locations, I am getting the above error I think. p  pSo, what I did was I added a reference to project 1 which defines the data set to project 3 the UI and used the web service to get the DataSet and assing to the right type, now when the project 3 which has the web form runs, I get the below runtime exception.p  blockquote   pSystem.InvalidOperationException   There is an error in XML document 1,   5058.    System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaException   Multiple definition of element   httptempuri.orgNorthwindDataSet.xsdCustomers   causes the content model to become   ambiguous. A content model must be   formed such that during validation of   an element information item sequence,   the particle contained directly,   indirectly or implicitly therein with   which to attempt to validate each item   in the sequence in turn can be   uniquely determined without examining   the content or attributes of that   item, and without any information   about the items in the remainder of   the sequence.p blockquote  pI think this might be because of some cross referenceing errors.p  pMy question is, is there a way to use the visual studio generated DataSets in such a way that I can use the same DataSet in all layers for reuse but separate the Table Adapter logic to the Data Access Layer so that the front end is abstracted from all this by the web servicep  pIf I have hand write the code I loose the goodness the data set generator gives and also if there are columns added later I need to add it by hand etc so I want to use the visual studio wizard as much as possible.p
Negative 5852 pIm trying to figure out why a simple query in LINQ is returning odd results.p  pI have a view defined in the database.  It basically brings together several other tables and does some data munging.  It really isnt anything special except for the fact that it deals with a large data set and can be a bit slow.p  pI want to query this view based on a long.  Two sample queries below show different queries to this view.p  precodevar la  Runtime.OmsEntityContext.Positions.Wherep gt p.AccountNumber  12345678.ToList  var deDa  Runtime.OmsEntityContext.Positions.Wherep gt p.AccountNumber  12345678.Selectp gt new  p.AccountNumber, p.SecurityNumber, p.CUSIP .ToList codepre  pThe first one should hand back a List.  The second one will be a list of anonymous objects.p  pWhen I do these queries in entities framework the first one will hand me back a list of results where theyre all exactly the same.p  pThe second query will hand me back data where the account number is the one that I queried and the other values differ.  This seems to do this on a per account number basis, ie if I were to query for one account number or another all the Position objects for one account would have the same value the first one in the list of Positions for that account and the second account would have a set of Position objects that all had the same value again, the first one in its list of Position objects.p  pI can write SQL that is in effect the same as either of the two EF queries.  They both come back with results say four that show the correct data, one account number with different securities numbers.p  pWhy does this happen  Is there something that I could be doing wrong so that if I had four results for the first query above that the first records data also appears in the 24ths objectsp  pI cannot fathom what wouldcould be causing this.  Ive searched Google for all kinds of keywords and havent seen anyone with this issue.  We partial class out the Positions class for added functionality smart object and some smart properties.  There are even some constructors that provide some view model type support.  None of this is invoked in the request Im 99 sure of this.  However, we do this same pattern all over the app.p  pThe only thing I can think of is that the mapping in the EDMX is screwy.  Is there a way that this would happen if the primary keys in the EDMX were not in fact unique given the way the view is constructed  Im thinking that the dev who imported this model into the EDMX let the designer auto select what would be unique.p  pAny help would give a haggered dev some hopep

Negative 5852 pIm modifying the Coldfusionbased interface for a listserv admin application to show snippits of recentlyposted messages on a page.

Negative 5852 pAn statistical accumulator allows one to perform incremental calculations.

If this is the case then i want to show a popup in WPF application.p  pTo implement this I Thought of using WCF services. I have got 2 options. Create a seperate WCF service and run it as soon as WPF application runs and then ask the client application to communicate.p  pSecond option is to host the WCF service inside the WPF application and run it when WPF application starts.p  pI am not able to decide on which way to choose. If anyone of u has implemented this kind of setup before,please share your ideas.p

Negative 5852 pIm thinking of buy an android phone, but Im a little bit scared about the security and privacy because in my palm I had in contacts and calendar a lot of private information. First I thought it could be solved by trying to sync without google, but in the last time I get a lot of information of security holes in androidapps to that I cant be sure that the phone self isnt compromised. I dont mean criminal apps, I mean criminal websites or apps with installed in background. p  pSo my idea was to encrypt all entries [Update4] only the description and text based field will be encrypted, not the time [Update4] of the calendar and contacts. This means writing an app, where I can define a security level for each record. Than I can set which entries should be decrypted and which not. So if Im surfing in the www I can encrypted all and it will be save. Even if I sync with google I can go this way Update So google only has the encrypted data. After that I decrypt the records. Of course this is sometimes inconvenient, but I fear security is always inconvenient. [Update2] To make it clear, the data wont be decrypted on the fly, so if the data are encrypted and I open the calendar app I only will the the time and an encrypted description.[Update2]p  p[Update3] What I dont want to do is to hack the androidsystem, meaning to root the phone or install a special firmware. Furthermore I dont want to invest weeks for development, so programming a new PIMapp is not an option. I simply want to take every record from the calendercontact database and encrypt the critical data. As far as I know there is an api to read and write such data.

Negative 5852 pHi I am building a Flex application using Pure MVC pattern and Zend framework for calling php code on the server. I need to sync some data with my server which is using MySQL as the database. And there are 5 such tables I need to sync. So I call these php functions at regular intervals from Flex and use long polling on php side. The client side code for my subjects lies in 5 different proxies. Here are my questionsp  pShould I send 5 separate requests from each proxy to call the php code which is lying in separate classes. Or should I build a separate proxy to send 1 request from 1 php file and then distribute this data among different proxies on the client side. Which one will be more effecient Mathematics shows using separate proxies and php classes allow more number of users to be accomodated on the server.p  pCan I write 1 SQL command to fetch data from all 5 tables given they cant be joined on any columnp

Negative 5852 pI have some C code for Android that does lots of lowlevel number crunching. Id like to know what settings I should use e.g. for my Android.mk and Application.mk files so that the code produced will run on all current Android devices but also takes advantage of optimisations for specific chipsets. Im looking for good default Android.mk and Application.mk settings to use and I want to avoid having to litter my C code with ifdef branches.p  pFor example, Im aware that ARMv7 has floating point instructions and some ARMv7 chips support NEON instructions and that the default ARM supports neither of these. Is it possible to set flags so that I can build ARMv7 with NEON, ARMv7 without NEON and the default ARM build Im know how to do the latter two but not all 3. Im cautious about what settings I use as I assume the current defaults are the safest settings and what risks other options have.p  pFor GCC specific optimisation, Im using the following flagsp  precodeLOCALCFLAGSffastmath O3 funrollloops codepre  pIve checked all 3 of these speed up my code. Are there any other common ones I could addp  pAnother tip I have is to add LOCALARMMODE  arm to Android.mk to enable a speed up on newer arm chips although Im confused at exactly what this does and what happens on older chips.p

Negative 5852 pI have a Rails 3 project running on top of PostgreSQL 9.0.p  pstrongUse Casestrong Users can request to follow codeArtistscode by name. To do this, they submit a list of names to a REST resource. If I cant find the codeArtistcode by name in the local collection, I consult last.fm for information about them, and cache that information locally. This process can take some time, so it is delegated to a background job called codeIndexArtistJobcode.p  pstrongProblemstrong codeIndexArtistJobcode will be run in parallel. Thus, it is possible that two users may request to add the same codeArtistcode at the same time. Both users should have the codeArtistcode added to their collection, but only one codeArtistcode should end up in the local database.p  pRelevant portions of the codeArtistcode model arep  precoderequire serviceslastfm  class Artist lt ActiveRecordBase   validatespresenceof name   validatesuniquenessof name, casesensitive gt false  def self.lookupname   artist  Artist.findbynamename   return artist if not artist.nil    info  LastFM.getartistinfoname   return if info.nil     Check local DB again for corrected name.   if name.downcase  info.name.downcase     artist  Artist.findbynameinfo.name     return artist if not artist.nil   end    Artist.new       name gt info.name,       imageurl gt info.imageurl,       bio gt info.bio      end end codepre  pThe codeIndexArtistJobcode class is defined asp  precodeclass IndexArtistJob lt Struct.newuserid, artistname   def perform     user  User.finduserid       May return a new, uncommitted Artist model, or an existing, committed one.     artist  Artist.lookupartistname     return if artist.nil       Presume the thread is preempted here for a long enough time such that      the work done by this worker violates the DBs unique constraint.     user.artists ltlt artist    rescue ActiveRecordRecordNotUnique   Lost race, defer to winning model     user.artists ltlt Artist.lookupartistname   end end codepre  pWhat Im trying to do here is let each worker commit the new codeArtistcode it finds, hoping for the best. If a conflict does occur, I want the slower workers to abandon the work they did in favor of the codeArtistcode that was just inserted, and add that codeArtistcode to the specified user.p  pIm aware of the fact that Rails validators are no substitute for actual data integrity checking at the level of the database. To handle this, I added a unique index on the Artist tables lowercased name field to handle this and to use for searching. Now, if I understand the documentation correctly, an ARs association collection commits changes to the item being added codeArtistcode in this case and the underlying collection in a transaction. But I cant be guaranteed the codeArtistcode will be added.p  pAm I doing this correctly If so, is there a nicer way to do it I feel like structuring it around exceptions accentuates the fact that the problem is one of concurrency, and thus a bit subtle.p

I was surprised to find that almost all Selenium RC setup diagram on the internet are similar to this diagram clones. No one has ever attempted to create a different diagram or give more description for Selenium RC setup.p  pAppreciate if anyone can give me guidance on how to setup Selenium RC. The things that i want to know arep  ol liCan i use Selenium RC to test any website on the Internetli liHow to setup Selenium RCli liIs my current setup correct My current setup is like this In a LAN network which has access to the Internet, I have 3 servers. Server1 comes with IE8, Server2 comes with Firefox 3.6. Server3 will be used as the Selenium RC server. So, Selenium RC in server3 will remotely control server1 and server2 to start up IE and FF. Server1 and 2 will use server3 as the HTTP proxy to connect to any webserver on the Internet. If I want to test a website such as yahoo.com, I can write Selenium script and let it run in Server3 to control the IE and FF in server1 and 2.li ol

It needs to be able to generate neighbors which would fall off the grid like 0000 or 2101 in a 20x20 grid because thats how my A tracks across multiple maps laid sidebyside.

Negative 5852 pI really have almost no idea how I can even begin to do this so Ill just explain it. I have a custom view that holds another, smaller view. Those two views are entirely built in IB, the main one has several input fields and will only resize which I think Ive got pretty much down. The second one appears after the input in the main one has been set. To be clear, the first one only asks for some inputs, once is has them, the second view appears and starts using those input values. What I would like to do is to be able to put some inputs first, and have the second view appear, then put in some other inputs, and have emanotherem view that looks the same as the first one appear, but instead use the new input values. p  pWhat I want to know is if I have to make the same custom view in IB several times, or how I think it might be done to make the second view sort of a separate class, and have a new object created for each new input and, from another class, control how theyre positioned in the main view. If that is the way its done Id like some help because I really do not know how to programmatically make a new object, or do any of these things. The program would have to understand that the views are entirely separate, and for each command such as cancel to be applied to only one of the views.p  pI realize this is very broad but I dont have any experience at all with this particular problem. I basically have a custom view that takes some input, and would like for the view to repeat itself each time inputs are sent, but for each view to be independent of one another. p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 5852 pIm trying to make a mobile application using jQuery Mobile and Phonegap. But first of all Id like to say that Im not a professional programmer Im only a student trying to understand de basics of a mobile application. I do have some experience in HTML and PHP.  So Im trying to learn myself some of the basics of a mobile application I tried it before but due to a lack off time I did not have the time to investigate the problem I was experiencing back then. p  pThe thing Im trying to realize is quite simple I have a SQL database with names 1, where they work2 and a description3. All of them have an unique ID  So 4 tables. First thing Id like to pull from the database is their names according from where they work.p  pI tried to follow several tutorials, guides and read trough some other stuff. This is what I came up with. This is a PHPfile placed on the server.p  precode  lt  include includesdb.php  sql  mysqlquerySELECT name FROM work  array  Array   ifmysqlnumrowssql gt 0      fori0 i lt countsql i          rec  mysqlfetchassocsql         array[name]  rec[name]                              echo jsonencodearray   gt codepre  pWhen I open this PHPfile I do get a result back from the database, formatted in JSON. But Im only getting one name in return while there are more names in that database.p  pNext Id go and place the jQuery code in the jQueryMobile app like thisp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt         document.readyfunction              .getJSONnames.php, functiondata                 namesDiv.htmldata                         ltscriptgt codepre  pOfcourse this is not returning anything this Im still trying to figure out how to display all the names as a list in the HTML file.  But after this I want to be able to tap on a name from that list and get the description from that person on a next page. I know in PHP you can get the ID from the URL page.phpid1 and then pass it on in your query to get the correct data but how can this be done when JSON is handeling everything p  pI hope someone can help me out I know Im asking a lot and that my knowledge is maybe insufficient but I would really appreciate any help I can get. p

Negative 5852 pWeve been seeing this error crop up in our system event logs an alarming amount. It relates to a very simple commandline app literally four or five lines of actual processing code that consumes a webservice on the same machine. I modified the application configuration and it seemed to fix things, but now its back.br The error only appears in the Event Viewer, and looks a little like this  p  blockquote   pEvent Type   Errorbr   Event Source .NET Runtime 2.0 Error Reportingbr   Event Category   Nonebr   Event ID 5000br   Date     19092011br   Time     092604br   User     NAbr   Computer SQLbr   Description   EventType clr20r3, P1 estimatorcli.exe, P2 1.0.0.0, P3 4e410f1b, P4   mscorlib, P5 2.0.0.0, P6 4d8c128c, P7 420e, P8 51, P9   system.servicemodel.fault, P10 NIL.p blockquote  pSorry if this is too much.br Googling hasnt brought back a whole lot of information, just some obscure references to the EventType. Ive tried debugging, and a lot of the time, the program runs fine on my XP64 development machine the servers running 2003 Ent64. However, when I update the Service Reference, Visual Studio creates two references to the Web Service, and when I try to run the app, it throws a nasty error that seems to indicate that the app cant determine which of the references it shoudl be using. Removing the surplus reference in the app.config file seems to cure this, but Ive done this and moved the compiled app to the server and am still getting this error. I also find it interesting that the error is listed as being .Net 2.0 when the app was written for .Net 3.5 the server has .Net 3.5SP1 installed.br Could this be a Visual Studio bug If so, could there be a way around itbr Thanks.br strongUpdatestrong From going through the stack trace, I was able to discover the error was my fault I hadnt passed enough parameters through to a stored procedure. Looking back, I guess the entire framework was working as can be expected, I just wish the errors were easier to readp

Negative 5852 pI am using some JGraphX components but this question can be applied to a general purpose of java. p  pI have a component inside of a JScrollPane. The issue I am having is that I have the ability to pan in the view by grabbing the view and moving it around like Google maps. but if the cursor leaves the viewport the scrolling changes directions. I have done some research and found the issue causing the problem. It can be found part of the way down on this page where it starts talking about how the scrollpane works. p  pa hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingcomponentsscrollpane.html relnofollowhttpdownload.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingcomponentsscrollpane.htmlap  blockquote   pMove the cursor over the image and press the cursor. Continuing to   press the cursor, drag to a point outside the image and pause. The   visible area of the image moves toward the cursor. This   scrollbydragging functionality is enabled by the scroll pane, and   with the JComponent API, but it is implemented by the custom component   that displays the image.p blockquote  pIt has the little demo so you can see how it works as well as the code is available for download.p  pSo by default the scrollpane has a scroll to drag implemented but it is actually opposite of how I need mine to scroll. The JGraphX library I am using has extended most of the classes used to benefit itself in some way but the basic idea still applies. I really just need to know of the easiest way to disable this. Yhe page says its enabled by the scrollpane and the JComponent API, but what actually gets enabledp

Negative 5852 pIm looking into developing a new version of a clientserver application for a client.

The items to be displayed are WPF user controls, one with logic for image and one for logic about video.p  pThe current application is web based and accesses the central database directly. When all the clients the ones that present the information request data it is done through a webservice. The customer is very happy to use the web based client, although they request more rich behavior. This includes a principal requirement og having a preview of both a single slide and of a collection of slides.p  pI started developing this as a WPF application discarding silverlight because of the preview of a wpf user control. Now im faced with the problemchallenge of defining how to access the database. The customers probably want the same usage pattern as they have now, where they move around with their labtops and thus not being on the same network as the database all the time.p  pMy question is this How do I design the database connectivity layer, should i go for pure web service based so everybody always use this, or should i make some kind of disconnected mode, where they can work at home, then connect and synchronize their data Should i require them to be on the same network as the databse, so i can connect directly using a database layer and a connectionstringp  pWill a webservice based approach be fast enough for working with images, videos thinking about only loading thumbnails of these, else data would kill the performance several Gb og data.

Thus far I have been able to load the codeuser32.dllcode and call the codeSetSystemCursorcode, codeLoadCursorAcode, and codeShowCursorcode.  Out of all of the calls made, only codeShowCursorcode works as expected.  p  pThe issue may very well be that I dont fully understand what a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64839128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeLoadCursorcodea and a hrefhttppinvoke.netdefault.aspxuser32SetSystemCursor.html relnofollowcodeSetSystemCursorcodea actually do.

I had not seen the MSDN documentation for codeSetSystemCursorcode.  Thanks for the tip on Pinvoke... and I dont know why I didnt pull up the MSDN for both of them.p  pAdmittedly, I have not played with system DLLs much.

Negative 5852 pI am reading some papers about Genetic Algorithms and often they mention Evolutionary Algorithms in a very similar way. According to Wikipedia, GAs are subset of EAs. However, if we look closer, we can notice that both are metaheuristic optimization algorithms based on natural selection crossover, selection, mutation and both dont have a fixed representation it depends on the problem to solve, even we traditionaly use binary representations for GAs. They are very similar. So, my question is can we consider every evolutionary algorithm a genetic algorithm  and what are the real differences between them  Thank you p

Negative 5852 pPlease see the code at the bottom of the post.  There is a table inside a div.  When the codesizecode variable is small, like 2 or 3, and all the cells can easily fit inside the div, the width of the codeltthgtcode cells are controlled correctly to have width 100px.  If you change the codesizecode variable codesize  20code, you will see that the table codeltthgtcode cells are squeezed to fit in the div, even though it has an codeoverflowautocode property.  I see the same thing for codeoverflowscrollcode.p  pWhat I would like to see is the table cell width remain constant at 100px, and the div introduce a scroll bar to scroll to see all cells.

Negative 5852 pI am trying to create an android layout that uses about 13 of the screen for a App Title.  And then for the other 23 it has 6 evenly spaced out buttons in rows of 2, in 3 columns.  In each button will contain text and an image that could potentially vary in size.  I have been reading a lot and have yet to come up with a perfect way to to this.  I have an example that mostly works except a few of my buttons are different sizes and so this does not work buttons are different sizes.  Plus i have no idea if it will work with phones of different sizes.  Anyway, if anyone could take a look at this xml layout and maybe suggest a better way.

Negative 5852 pstrongThe problemstrongbr Im using fitnesse for running some automated tests. There is a class called TableTable, which if enhanced would allow me to do some cool things. What I need to do is change what the method codeappendInstructionscode of this class does. p  pBecause fitnesse explicitly looks for TableTable class, I cannot simply create a child class of TableTable with my required enhancements  I cannot make fitnesse find and use my custom child class.p  pstrongMy current solutionstrongbr The temporary solution Ive adopted is Ive borrowed the source code of TableTable, added it to my source tree under the same package as it is under in fitnesses jar, and have changed its code to suit my needs. My codes class files appear before fitnesses jar in the classpath, so my changes get picked up.p  pstrongWhat Im trying to dostrongbr Instead of entirely shadowing the TableTable class in fitnesses jar, I want to rewrite just the one method of that class at runtime. Will any code generation library like cglib help me rewrite the class at runtime and help me achieve thisp

Negative 5852 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAzFoe.png altenter image description herep  pI have attached an screenshot of two pages side by side. In the left side the form element in the top right is loaded as part of the full page, and is fully styled with twitter Bootstraps styles for the grey codewellcode, the codeforminlinecode, etc. p  pOn the right, the form is loaded via an ajax call, the code beingp  precodefunction loadelement, id     .getlazyLoads  id, functiondata         element.replaceWithdata.childNodes       codepre  pAnd you can see that the form does not get emmostem of bootstraps styles.

However, I also need to get the Value of each meter from a previous time exactly 1440 and 1439 minutes earlier  if that makes any sense.p  pSo after the query is run, I need a table with the columns from TableOne and TableTwo, but with two additional columns for ValueB and ValueC B been the value 1440 minutes earlier, and C 1439 earlier.

Negative 5852 pAs I understand, Ruby 1.9 uses OS threads but only one thread will still actually be running concurrently though one thread may be doing blocking IO while another thread is doing processing. The threading examples Ive seen just use codeThread.newcode to launch a new thread. Coming from a Java background, I typically use thread pools as to not launch to many new threads since they are heavyweight.p  pIs there a thread pool construct built into ruby I didnt see one in the default language libraries.

Negative 5852 pstrongBackgroundstrong Ive been working on a small proofofconcept web application in ASP.NET 4.0 with C and Ive been using Linq To SQL because its quick and easy.

Negative 5852 pLet me explain my question a bit.p  pI am creating a flash website and I am using a small external preloader swf to load in the main swf. I have been able to get my preloader swf to take up the whole browser window but as soon as it loads in the main swf it only displays in its normal dimensions that it was built in.p  pI do have a resize listener within the main flash application and as soon as I change the size of the browser the main swf then occupies the whole browser. But how can I get it to start out that wayp  pIve tried using an ENTERFRAME handler but that broke some of my animations. Ive tried setting the width and height of my loader object in the preloader and that      doesnt seem to work either. Ive also tried adding an ADDEDTOSTAGE listener to the loader, but that doesnt seem to have changed anything. I also tried having the preloader be in one scene and the main application be in another so that I was only loading one swf, but that didnt seem to work and I dont prefer that method of preloading.p  pI havent been able to find a solution anywhere.

My goal is to proxy all requests of the form codeltsubdomaingt.domain.comfile.htmlcode to codewww.domain.comltsubdomaingtfile.htmlcode.p  pI somehow need to capture the codeltsubdomaingtcode of the original URL and use it to construct the target URL.p  pI assume that I need an Apache directive that can match regular expressions on the whole URL, instead of the part of the url after codeHTTPHOSTcode, since my target URL contains the original URLs subdomain. For this reason I cant use the codeProxyPassMatchcode directive, since it only matches the part of the URL after codeHTTPHOSTcode.p  pAnother alternative is to use as many codeVirtualHostcode sections as my subdomains.

Negative 5852 pI have two CUDA functions that manipulate linked lists in global memory. The function codepmalloccode removes the head element of one of the lists. It first chooses a list and then calls codepmallocBucketcode which actually removes the head element. Should the chosen list be empty, codepmalloccode will try other lists. The codepfreecode function on the other hand will insert a new head element into a list.p  pMutual exclusion is achieved through semaphores, one each for each linked list. The implementation for the semaphores is from the book emCUDA By Exampleem. In some other test code, the semaphore works perfectly.p  pThe problem I have with the code is the following Sometimes, several threads will try to access the same linked list simultaneously. These accesses are succesfully sequentialized by the semaphore, but sometimes, a thread will remove the same head element from the list as a previous thread. This may happen immediately consecutively, or there can be one or more other threads in between. The thread will then codefreecode an unallocated memory area and my program crashes.p  pHere are the mentioned functions. codemmdcode is a structure in global memory that is initialized from another function.p  precodeextern device void waitint s    whileatomicCASs, 0, 1  0   extern device void signalint s    atomicExchs, 0   device void pfreeExpression node    LinkedList l  LinkedList mallocsizeofLinkedList   lgtcell  node   nodegttype  EMPTY   nodegtfuncidx  0   nodegtname  NULL   nodegtlen  0   nodegtvalue  0   nodegtnumParams  0   freenodegtparams    int targetBin  blockIdx.x  mmd.bucketSize  threadIdx.x  BINSIZE        The for loop and subsequent if are necessary to make sure that only one     thread in a warp is actively waiting for the lock on the semaphore.

Yes, I do realize that the use of atomic operations and semaphores is less than ideal for CUDA applications. But in this case, as of yet I have no idea how this could be implemented differently and my project is on an absolutely fixed deadline that is approaching really fast, so this will have to do.p

Negative 5852 pIm working on a project with a coworker and we have been beating our heads over our desks trying to figure this one out.

For me, when I try to run this code, it opens up the Internet Explorer browser correctly, but even though Im using an InternetExplorer object, it opens up the tabs in Firefox.  I delved into the class and tried to print out anything useful I could find.  The name property in my InternetExplorer object was Windows Explorer.  I read up more on what ShellWindows actually does and that makes sense, but it doesnt help me.  This seems to imply that its opening up my default browser through the InternetExplorer object instead of Internet Explorer.  I also had different results from my coworker who has Chrome as a default browser.  I switched my default browser to Chrome to see if that was the issue, but then the two extra tabs opened in Chrome.  All I really need is to open an Internet Explorer browser with 3 tabs each with their own URL.  Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5852 pI have a div with a lot of content in it which crosses the page size. so i was wondering whether it is possible to add an up arrow image and down arrow image above and below the div respectively. When I would hover over the images the content on the div will start scrolling like the way it scrolls on a page. but I dont want a scroll bar to appear next to my div.. I jus want the content to scroll only when i hover over the images..p  pIn the code below when i hover over the HOVER ME div it jumps to the end of the div.

Negative 5852 pIm designing a photooriented Facebook app that would let users tell stories in the appspecific way and advertise such stories by posting a single, preferably large, cover photo. Photo posting is done by the app and people that would like to see the story need an easy and obvious way of being redirected to the corresponding appgenerated page. So hence is the question.p  pIs it possible for a Facebook app to post a maximally large columnwide photo on the users behalf, so that when others nonusers included click on the photo, it takes them to a specific page that is related to the app instead of zooming into the photo by default If not, what would be the best workaroundp

Negative 5852 pI am currently working on an MVC4 C Project within Visual Studio 2012. We recently added a system that sends out emails to our users. The system uses the MailMessage Class to format the message that is sent through the SmtpClient Class. This message has the property to be html to enable some visual formatting of the body text. p  pThe issue is that the property message.Body is currently written into a single string which makes the code look very ugly and quite difficult to actually format. I did some research and notices that some solutions had the email as a separate HTML file that was linked into the system. This allowed for much simpler formatting of the message. Only issue is that the examples I found lacked documentation on how to properly implement this type of solution so I wondering if anyone could point me to some information or possibly provide an example.p  pHere is what I mean by ugly MailMessage code.p  precode        var message  new MailMessagefromAddress, toAddress         message.Subject  Password Recovery Email         message.IsBodyHtml  true         message.Body          Hello   UserName          ltbr gt          Greetings from website,          ltbr gt          You have requested a Password reset.

Negative 5852 pI have an iPad app that consists of a main view and associated view controller which draws some fancy graphics. The things that are drawn are controlled by a host of parameters mostly floats which at the moment I store in the main view controller class. The main view asks for the parameters inside of drawRect.p  pI would like to liveupdate the main view from a slider inside of a popover menu. However the popover contains a UINavigationController which contains a UITableViewController which contains custom UITableViewCells which contain the sliders so getting the message back associating the right controls to the right data variables is a pain. Also the messages have to go both ways because I have to initialize the slider positions using the data when they first appear.p  pMy main question is therefore what is the elegant way to send the slider change information back to the main view controller and to have it liveupdate the main view. I realize that I should be using delegates but since I have maybe 30 parameters I could end up writing a lot of selectors and Im not sure how I should be propagating the information about the main delegate target up through the view controller stack.p

I have installed TFS 2012 on Win Server 2008 R2. Basically the error says that the access to the destination folder is denied and so it is not able to copy. The TFS admin console shows the build service is running as LocalService. And I granted full control to the local Service account to the drop folder. I tried to even fiddle with Share tab in the properties of the folder. There is no network as such any way, only single machine with all the TFS services running on it.

Negative 5852 pI have a simple server program written in C, and the program is running on an Ubuntu Linux distribution.  The program is intended to listen for messages sent from the client, write those messages to a file each message goes into a separate file, and send an acknowledgement back to the client once the message has been received and stored.p  pI have noticed that, as the server continues to receive and store messages, the amount of available system memory quickly decreases and continues to decrease until messages have stopped.  Memory remains constant when no messages are being sent.  However, I have also noticed that I can free up the memory again by deleting the written files from disk I can do this even while the server is still running.  I am therefore led to believe that the memory issue has something to do with my file operations, though I cant see any issue with the code that writes the files.  p  pCan someone helpp  pNOTE I am observing the memory usage with top.  p  pI have included an excerpt from the program.

Negative 5852 pI have a problem with my web application. Sometimes Internet Explorer 8 does not respond when a new window is opened. I cant do anything except kill the process through Windows Task Manager.p  pI will try to explain the webapp system. There is a main portal, where we open interfaces. Every new window is opened through this portal. As we are in a process of migration JavaScript to jQuery, there is a part of interfaces work with jQuery and other with JavaScript without any JavaScript lib.p  pWe use  Jquery  1.7.1 Jquery UI  1.8.21 requirejs  1.0.2p  pThe problem appears only on migrated interface jQuery and this problem is only reproducible on production environment and in some customers. Locally on our development servers we havent this problem.p  pOther point, IE not responding randomly around every 30 minutes sometime more.p  pTo load jQuery and our libs we use requirejs.p  pFirst we have checked all code executed during the loading, and added trycatch blocks, but no errors are raised.p  pWe have installed the lastest version of requirejs 2.1.5. The problem is still there.p  pWe have check if there isnt an ajax call on error but on server log there is a response OK 200.p  pCan anybody tell me if there is other track to check I searched the past few weeks for some information on the web. I heard something about the limits of Ajax connections with IE 8 max 6, but we tried to add a loop for with 1000 ajax call without troubles.p  pI know that my explanation isnt very complete, but i cant post here any piece of code.

Negative 5852 pOkay so I am currently constructing a School schedule app as a beginner project and I could use some help with the final steps. My app essentially consists of two tableview controllers. THe first table contains the students block schedule My Schedule. My schedules table has a dictionary and has keys for each block the student could fill. The second contains a list of all the potential classes a student could take Class List. All the courses in class list are stored across several arrays. If the student wants to edit their schedule they press an edit button on My Schedule, this produces a Change button on every cell in the schedule. What I would like is to create an IBAction that would register the key of the cell that was pressed. Then the app would go over to class list and display all the classes. The user would select a new course and the app would take that course and use it to replace the course in the block that was changed. p  pI guess what I really need to know how to do isp  pregister which cell was chosenp  pprogrammatically segue between view controllersp  preplace a value in a dictionary for a particular keyp  pI realize that this is a lot of info and I apologize if it is confusing or I did not provide enough information. If you would like to see some of my code or need some clarification I would be more than happy to give it.p

Negative 5852 pWe have a TCPIP sockets server written in C used for transferring binary files to clients. e.g., clips, images. Asynchronous BeginSendEndSend with callbacks are being utilized to send byte[] buffers.p  pNew requirement is to encrypt the data being transferred. Each client connection will supply an encryption key for the server to use. Actual encryption algorithm is not as essential, i.e., the goal is to simply ensure that the data is not sent in the clear. Even RC2CryptoServiceProvider with 40bit keys would suffice... RijndaelManaged with 128bit keys is an overkill and rather CPUintensive in comparison with RC2.p  pIt is certainly possible to first generate an encrypted version of data files before transferring them. Ideally though, we should encrypt the file on the fly as the data is read from file and sent on the socket. Given the size of data files, reading entire file contents to memory is neither efficient nor scalable.p  pAre there a few good patterns to follow when encrypting data from files on the fly to send to a sockets peerp

Weve tried to open the pages in IExplorer from batch scripts, but the browser gives security errors regarding the pages security certificate, and that needs human interaction, this needs to be automated ASAP.p  pI wouldnt mind if one of you had your own function that converted at least an array into a JSON object String, so I can store itp

Negative 5852 pI understand that mutable objects a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6310867whyarentpythonsetshashablecant be hasheda, but why should this also be true of the methods on mutable objects, especially given that they compare as expectedp  pFor examplep  precodegtgtgt d1, d2  ,  gtgtgt d1.keys  d2.keys False gtgtgt set[d1.keys] Traceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt TypeError unhashable type dict codepre  pIn the example, coded1.keyscode is not itself the codedictcode the exception complains about. Simply having a codedictcode as an attribute is obviously no general bar to being hashable, as instances of usercreated classes, by default, are both hashable and have a codedictcode attribute. A method object will not itself change in any meaningful way over its lifetime, whether or not its codeselfcode component is mutable. Is there some way Im not seeing that hashing methods on mutable object breaks the contract implied by hashingp  pBelow is my attempt at a wrapper that ensures a method will be hashable and also plays nice with regular method objects.

Negative 5852 pIm new to VBA and cannot figure this question out for the life of me. I apologize if Im not using the proper words to describe my problemp  pI have a function in VBA that opens a URL which downloads a csv file. I have the variable assigned to that download declared As String. Then, I split it into rows and split the relevant row I need information in the second row into columns.

I can also use the Join method to display the entire second row in one cell with the substrings separate by a comma.p  pGoal I want to be able to customize which pieces of information substrings from the second row to display, and I want them displayed in their own adjacent cells adjacent by columns.

Negative 5852 pI have a problem implementing minhashing. On paper and from reading I understand the concept, but my problem is the permutation trick.

Negative 5852 pI need to design custom datafloaw block, which acts like a buffer but would makes items available after some timeout. I would put incoming messages into a queue and start timer. When timer is triggered, I wold move an item from queue into BufferBlock which would make it available for Dataflow consumers.p  pIf I move an item from internal queue into output BufferBlock from timer handler, obviously it wont be thread safe, because timer handler can collide with enqueue call and corrupt queue. There is a claim in MSDN that dataflow is based on Actor idea, which assumes that messages are executed singlethreaded thus solving synchronization problem. But If I introduce a timer handler, this would break this assumption. I can use old school lock on the queue, or use CuncurrentQueue but I am curious if there is more idiosyncratic way of dataflow to manage timer so that it does not conflict with dataflow blocks Post call.p  pOr to extend this question, is there an elegant way to have a dataflow block handling several different types of messages and still offer threadsafe modelp

So rev1.text will sometimes throw an exception because getRev ends up returning null or undefined if called before Revisions is loaded.p  pI then end up having to check a ton of variablesobjects throughout my code for existence before using any of their properties just to be safe.p  ul liI could imagine using a router to not render my example template until after a different collection is ready but for nested templates, and Session variable changes this doesnt work so hot.li liI could imaging wrapping the helper code in a if isCollectionReady which might help but doesnt seem best practice.li ul  pThe question is Is there a canonical or best practice way to, identify these situations, code for them, or avoid this altogetherp

Negative 5852 pSo im developing Android app, sort of a book reader. The books are stored as a 500mb binary files with certain objects stored in it, and in a tiny binary file that contains mappings to particular objects in the big file. I need to find most efficient way to perform an update of certain publication file.  The incomming update package will contain relatively small file with offsets  lenghts of objects that need to be deleted from the original big file, a set of new objects that will be added at the end of big file, and the new mapping after the update is done obviously.p  pIve googled ALOT, but still I cant find out whether theres any better solution than copying the content i want to be kept into a new file. Is ther any more efficient way to do this I mean the aproach i mentioned requires double disc space as the main big file takes, and it doesnt seem to be any fast way either.p  pThx in advance, Macp
Negative 5852 pUPDATE 2 I never found the solution to this. Since the instructors code is readily available for us to use and hack together with our own, and Id already wasted weeks trying to debug, I just created a new table and started from his code, made changes and tested as I went, until I ended up with that I wanted in functionality. If anyone every comes across a reason for the odd behavior, Id sincerely appreciate knowing what caused this.p  pAlmost everyone who suggested anything offered up ideas I had already tried, and listed as already tried, in my original post. Thank you to everyone offering their insight, but please do read posts completely before making suggestions.p  pUPDATE to present my main question more clearly. The original post is below that with all code, as well as what Ive tried.p  pI designed my updateData function to update a record. Instead, it returns its error code.p  precodesub updateData       and this returns Update Failed for me. I cant figure out why.      sql  UPDATE friendface SET firstname  firstname,         lastname  lastname,         emailaddress  emailaddress,         password  password         WHERE userid  userid      rc  dbhgtdosql     if rc  1          print Update Failed       codepre  hr  pNinja editing as I reread through this mess 3p  pCode at the bottom. Sorry if the formatting is awful or Im not descriptive enough. I really tried. Ask if I can provide anything else that is helpful.p  pHi everyone,p  pSchool assignment here, print a table with records you can edit and delete.p  pIve got an HTML page with forms for inserting data, then a perl script that displays the table with buttons to update and delete. Delete works fine. The whole script works fine EXCEPT the link from the block of text you get when you access the .pl directly, but I dont care about that at the moment without the contents of my UPDATE function. The code for the UPDATE function works fine line by line in MySQL. But I cant get the codeupdateDatacode function with the UPDATE query to work in my .pl file.p  pWere allowed full access to the instructors example code. I COULD start with his page, then modify it into my own page. Id rather be able to write my own page without relying on that crutch. I am, however, comparing my code to his and I dont see where Im going wrong. Syntax looks good, as far as I know  can find docs for. p  ul lipI played with varying syntax anyway just in case. Put a comma after the final record before my WHERE clause because it looked wrong without, but apparently without is the way to go. Everything I read says the current syntax is correct.pli lipI thought maybe it was trying to edit a codeuseridcode that didnt exist, but printing the codeuseridcode showed it was using the correct one.pli lipI think my codeDBIgtconnectcode is working because it doesnt return Connection Failed.pli lipThe correct function, codeupdateDatacode, is running because the final output is the Update Failed return code, unique to that function.pli lipI can trace the code through Edit button  Edit form  Confirm Edit function  updateData function  dbh authenticates successfully, codedosqlcode, which is my UPDATE query, which looks syntactically correct. But for some reason, codedbhgtdosqlcode doesnt come out true.pli lipIn the codeupdateDatacode function, I thought Id make sure the problem wasnt that I was only updating 4 of the 6 fields. Well, 5, since the key isnt ever going to be updated. Anyway, I thought that might be tripping it up somehow, but adding a line to update username didnt help, so I took it out again.pli ul  pIve really been trying to figure this out on my own and Im pulling my hair out. Its always some dumb little thing. Is it spacing It usually doesnt matter, but I know codeENDFORMcode had to be the first, and only, thing on the line in order to work for me. But I dont know of any spacing rules for this particular code. Please.

Negative 5852 pI am developing a web application that is going to be deployed to Heroku.p  pI have chosen to go with a Node.js stack as I am fed up with traditional web frameworks. I am designing the app on Express.js. Ive found it very productive and intuitive compared to e.g. Django or Grails.p  pSo the web app is going to have features for both guests and authenticated users. And as the app is deployed to Heroku, which is a cloud platform service, the application cannot have any internal state stored inside the server because of Herokus load balancers and practices in general. And the fact is that having internal state is also bad design in a distributed environment.p  pMy local development setup has a Redis instance for storing sessions and a MongoDB instance for storing user data, e.g. Facebook user details. I am using Passport.js and empassportfacebookem to handle authentications. Currently, I have only Facebook authentication implemented which works fine at least locally.p  pThe problem is that I am not sure nor have I read anywhere about how Express  Passport magically populates the emreq.userem object. Im a bit suspicious about that and it feels like that is stored in servers memory.p  precodepassport.serializeUserfunctionuser, done      console.log         This outputs a complete          User Profile object when the user logs in.,          user     donenull, user   passport.deserializeUserfunctionobj, done      console.log         And this too, but Im afraid that          obj comes from memory.,          obj     donenull, obj  codepre  pa hrefhttppassportjs.orgguideprofile relnofollow titleUser ProfilePassport.js documentationa does not tell very well about this one. My guess is that serializeUser gets the user from Facebook, but deserializeUser takes it from memory p  pIf so, would it be a solution to dump the raw user data into the Mongo database in serializeUser and then get it from there in deserializeUserp

Negative 5852 pI am migrating an ASP.NET web site to Azure. Currently we have MovableType installed on the server that hosts our web site, and a blog application in IIS that points to the files published by MovableType. In moving to Azure I would prefer to install MovableType on a server separate from our web site, but that means that our blog content will no longer reside on the same server as the main site.p  pIf I setup a subdomain to point to the blog server is there a way to rewrite, for example, www.mysite.comblogpost.html to blog.mysite.comblogpost.html  p  pI have tried the URL rewrite module, but it seems that it wants the rewritten Url to be on the same server.  I have also tried HTTP redirects, but that changes the Url in the address bar.p  pIf this isnt possible with rewrites or redirection, what would be the best approach  Is mapping a drive from one Azure server to another a reliable optionp

Negative 5852 pI am using Java Server Faces 2.2. My design is based on Twitter Bootstrap 3. Boostrap offers a component for styling a pagination. I am using this jQuery Plugin a hrefhttpbootstrappaginator.org relnofollowhttpbootstrappaginator.orga to generate the pagination dynamically.p  pInside my templates i am generating links with codehoutputLinkcode. I created a table with codehdataTablecode which is pageable and sortable. The page, the sort field and the sort order are passed as get parameters. The links are created with codehoutputLinkcode.p  pThe problem is now that the links for the pagination are created by the jQuery plugin and inserted into the page. Also i am using jQuery to adjust dynamically the position of the pagination floating it to the right because the option of plugin is not working.p  pAfter loading the page the pagination is floated to the right side. Now i am using the pagination to switch to an other page. The jquery plugin now regenerates the pagination. The pagination is now floated to the left the plugin resets the class attribute of the codeltulgtcode tag. After that the pagination is floated to the right i am adding the missing class by jquery.p  pThe problem is that you can see this floating to the right in the browser. That bevavior does not occour if i am using the links created by codehoutputLinkcode. codehoutputLinkcode adds something like codeidjidt75jidt84 namejidt75jidt84code to the link. Is this for ajax I think the jquery plugin generated links are also creating a ajax request, which updates the complete page so i am able to see the movement of the pagination.p  pWhat can i do to avoid this behavior I think the standard html links without the ids should force a complete new get request and not an ajax request. How is this possiblep

Negative 5852 pI started my road down web development about 1 year ago.

I was totally confused by this since codeconstructor.prototype  new superConstructorcode should be all it needed right Well I went to the source and found the actual function signature.p  precodeexports.inherits  functionctor, superCtor    ctor.super  superCtor   ctor.prototype  Object.createsuperCtor.prototype,      constructor        value ctor,       enumerable false,       writable true,       configurable true          codepre  pOnce I saw this I got totally confused while trying to figure out what codeObject.createcode is doing here.

Let me try and see if I can articulate what I emthinkem is going on and you guys can correct me p  pThe first argument to codeObject.createproto [, propertiesObject ]code is the prototype that you want this new object to have. I guess this is just easier than the classic method of defining a constructor and setting its codeprototypecode property The second argument is a simple hash with properties on it that should be added to the newly created object that it will return So, this...p  precodevar myInstance  Object.createsomePrototype,  someProp someVal, someProp2 someVal2 codepre  p...instead of thisp  precodefunction MyClass       this.prop  someVal     this.prop2  someVal2      etc  MyClass.prototype  somePrototype var myInstance  new MyClass codepre  pIm not sure if my understanding of codeObject.createcode is totally accurate so hopefully you guys can clarify. Assuming that I now understand codeObject.createcode why then does the codeutil.inheritscode function not look like thisp  precodeexports.inherits  functionctor, superCtor    ctor.super  superCtor   ctor.prototype  Object.createnew superCtor,      constructor        value ctor,       enumerable false,       writable true,       configurable true          codepre  h2To Summarizeh2  pWouldnt the codenew superCtorcode eliminate the need to do codeevents.EventEmitter.callthiscode inside of codeMyStreamcode Why is it so important that we make the prototypes the same and then run the codeEventEmittercode constructor on the actual instance that codeMyStreamcode is creating instead of just having the codeprototypecode be an actual instance of codeEventEmittercodep  pAlso, what is the purpose of adding a codeconstructorcode property to codectorcodes prototype Is that a JavaScript thing I dont know aboutp

Negative 5852 pMy current application is an EJB 2.x system and uses Entity Beans everywhere, with CMR amp CMP.  I am looking to replace the persistence layer with standard JPA and I am unable to find out if the following is possible.p  pThe system implements a logical delete by setting a column on the table VOIDIND  y when the record is requested to be deleted. Current processing logic in the system will retrieve all items from the child table using the CMR and then loop and discard the ones with the codeVOIDIND  ycode and only return to the client where codeVOIDIND  ncode.p  pThis seems very inefficient to me and I would rather not return these deleted records in the first place. Unfortunately I have only been able to find annotations that are implementation specific to help with this.p  pHibernate as Where and EclipseLink AdditionalCriteriap  pBut I am wondering if there are standard annotations that work specifically with JPAp

Negative 5852 pWere having some issues with getting the Reply function to work for comments in our WordPress site. Submitting comments in general works fine, but even though the URL Im redirected to from the Reply button looks correct, it just posts it as a normal comment, and the title above the comment section is just the regular title, not the expected Leave a Reply to.... Its a custom theme, but its set up to support this and WordPress itself is configured to allow threaded comments down to the default 5 levels.p  pHeres the site in question a hrefhttpantagonist.no relnofollowhttpantagonist.noap  pWhats strange about this is that it only happens in the live environment. I have a testing environment set up locally, where WordPress is configured with the exact same configuration and version of our template. The Reply function works perfectly there, with the same URL structure and parameters, and Im unable to reproduce whats going on in the live environment.p  pThe only differences are the hosting environments my local testing environment runs on Apache 2.2 on OS X 10.9, while the live environment runs on IIS 6 on Windows Server 2008 R2. Both are running PHP 5.5.8. Could this be due to the URL rewriting for permalinks WordPress does this automatically on Apache, but on IIS in the live environment we used a plugin called ISAPIRewrite 3 a hrefhttpwww.helicontech.comisapirewrite relnofollowhttpwww.helicontech.comisapirewritea to support the URL rewriting, with the following rulesp  precodeRewriteBase  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.phpp1 [NC,L] codepre  pIt seems to work fine for anything else than comment replies.p  pAny ideas for things we could check for or tryp

Negative 5852 pIve been trying to bind data to a drawerlayout over the past few days with no luck. I think my issue is the binding of the data and making sure that I have the correct parameters in the right spot. The code is below. For the purposes of this code, I have an array of items that I load from Resources.Array.NavigationItems. Once I have this in a string array, I iterate through the list, create a dictionary with an item, which is the text to be displayed, and an image, which is the image that I want to display. At this time, the image is just load from my resourcess drawables. I then create two arrays. These two arrays should map to the necessary from data in the javalist and to the id of the controls to display. When I run the code below, I get the error shown below the code. I am assuming that I have something wrong with my dictionary definitions. Suggestions are appreciated.  Quite honestly, Im not sure that I am creating the Dictionary or the List properly with the correct objects my skills in translating from java to .net are probably lacking in this area.p  precodenavigationItems  Resources.GetStringArrayResource.Array.NavigationItems  var mList  new ListltIDictionaryltstring, objectgtgt  forint i0iltnavigationItems.Lengthi     var hm  new DictionaryltString,Objectgt     hm.Additem, navigationItems[i]     hm.Addimage, Resource.Drawable.aniswath     mList.Addhm  var fromH  new string[] item, image  var toH  new int[]  Resource.Id.title, Resource.Id.icon   drawerList.Adapter  new SimpleAdapter this, mList,  Resource.Layout.customdraweritem, fromH, toH codepre  pHere are the contents of my ResourceLayoutcustomdraweritem.xmlp  precode   ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt     ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationhorizontalgt     ltImageView         androidididicon         androidlayoutwidth25dp         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue         androidlayoutmarginLeft12dp         androidlayoutmarginRight12dp         androidsrcdrawableaniswath gt     ltTextView         androidididtitle         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidlayouttoRightOfidicon         androidminHeightandroidattrlistPreferredItemHeightSmall         androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceListItemSmall         androidtextStylebold         androidgravitycentervertical         androidpaddingRight40dp gt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pError message determined from monitorp  precode0411 214050.022 EAndroidRuntime2515 java.lang.ClassCastException mono.android.runtime.JavaObject cannot be cast to java.util.Map 0411 214050.022 EAndroidRuntime2515 at android.widget.SimpleAdapter.bindViewSimpleAdapter.java147 0411 214050.022 EAndroidRuntime2515 at android.widget.SimpleAdapter.createViewFromResourceSimpleAdapter.java126 codepre

Negative 5852 pIm designing a small utility to help out with build systems.  The idea is that the utility will launch each instance of each compiler and output a log of all the files that the compiler opens during the compilation.  Something likep  precodetrackfiles cc c o foo.o foo.c codepre  pThen codetrackfilescode executes codecccode and outputs all the code.hcode and other files that codecccode opened. But codecccode might be any compiler or even an interpreter or just a program that does some kind of text transformation.p  pA similar idea is described in a hrefhttpmadscientist.netmakeautodep.html relnofollowPaul D Smiths Advanced AutoDependency tutoriala and attributed to HanWen Nienhuys.p  pOn Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and HPUX I think I can use codeLDPRELOADcode.  On AIX I can use codeLDRPRELOADcode and on OSX I can use codeDYLDINSERTLIBRARIEScode.  On most of those systems I can also use codestracecode if codeLDPRELOADcodelike tricks dont work.p  pThe one OS where I have no clue how to proceed is Windows.  Ive been looking around and everything Ive found so far seems, ..., unsatisfactory.p  pThe only answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1178257ldpreloadequivalentforwindowstopreloadsharedlibrariesLDPRELOAD equivalent for Windows to preload shared librariesa suggests AppInitDLLs, but points out they are deprecated andor disabled after Vista because they were broken.p  pThe accepted answer on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1210533interposersonwindowsinterposers on Windowsa points to Microsoft Researchs a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusprojectsdetours relnofollowDetoursa but that is proprietary and they charge big bucks USD10000 for 64bit support so that would make my utility worthless for just about everyone including me.  The other answer mentions something called WinAPI Override, but thats apparently 32bit only.p  pTheres surely some dependable, nonproprietary, programmatic way to do this on Windows.  Some tracing API perhaps  Id be happy with support only for more recent versions of Windows Windows 7 and 8, for example.p

Negative 5852 pThis question may be a bit nebulous, so please bear with me.p  pI am using Visual Studio, and I am new to the entire realm of unit testing.

Is there really a problem with using these convenient tools as simpler ways of running commands against my database that can give me immediate feedback on whether it passed or failedp  pMy followup question to that is this I have had to actually search pretty hard to find a unit test runner that lets me run strongindividual methodsstrong instead of running strongevery single unit test in a classstrong. Is this normal This whole thing kind of confuses me in general. Even when I do use tests for actually testing, why would I always want to run EVERY test every time Isnt that extremely wasteful of time and resources How do you control the order that they run in This seems even more imperative when tests have to depend on some data to exist before they can run appropriately.p  pAt the moment, I am using codexunitcode and then the unit test runner in codeReSharpercode, but out of the box, Visual Studio doesnt seem to let me run unit tests individually, just as huge batches in a single class.p  pAm I the only person confused by thisp

Negative 5852 pI have a question about the correct way to write efficient functional programs. Suppose Im given a list s of positive ints, and I want to find the minimum element or just 0 if empty. Then a generic functional program for doing this would look likep  precodeminList s       [] gt undefined      [x] gt x      x  t gt min x minList t  codepre  pIn a lazy language one can make this more efficient by adding an extra clause which terminates the recursion if a zero is found  this way s is only computed up to the first zerop  precodeminList s        [] gt undefined      [x] gt x      x  t gt if x0 then 0 else min x minList t codepre  pHowever, am I correct in believing that this sort of trick would not work in a strict evaluation language like OCaml, which would evaluate the whole of s before running minList If so, what would be the correct way to optimize this in OCamlp  pADDITIONAL QUESTION Ok, so if I understand that if statements are always lazy. But what about the following, for example I have a function on int lists again which first checks whether or not the ith element is zero i.e.p  precodef s  if si0 then 0 else g s codepre  pHere the input sequence s is present in both clauses of the if statement, but clearly for an efficient computation you would only want to evaluate si in the first case. Here, would OCaml always evaluate all of s, even if the first case succeedsp

Negative 5852 pbri would like to move set of dlls, exe and some .ini files to the client machines in an organization. For this Ive created a .MSI file using WIX installer. This MSI actually moves the files to System32 folder in the client machine. This can be installed manually or through the Microsoft system center. But my client doesnt want to take any other product for this installation. So i have a piece of code which returns me the work stations with IPs. Can any one suggest me how this installation process can be automated using web application developed in csharpbrIve seen one bManageEngineb a hrefhttpwww.manageengine.comproductsselfservicepassword relnofollowhttpwww.manageengine.comproductsselfservicepassworda product, In this product some how they are installinguninstalling the exemsi on the workstations from a web applications.p

Also, I have strongDAOstrong classes like codeFilmDAOcode and codeShowingDAOcode to retrieve data from the DB...p  pMy question is, should I create classes for things that are not real ementitiesem, but just page elements I mean classes like codeCarouselcode or codeSidebarcode, and their correspondent DAOs.p  pI think its really weird to have a codeSidebarDAOcode, however is alkso something that is retrieved from the DB from a Controller to be displayed on the page...p
Negative 5852 pIf I use an sql bulk loader to load 10 000 rows into an oracle database from a flat file, will the rows be inserted in the same order as they appear in the file For example, let us say there is a unique key column that is automatically incremented by 1 for every row inserted.p  pSo can I predict that the first row in the file will become the first row in the db, a.k.a have a value of 1 for this columnp
Negative 5852 pHi Im trying to implement a simple google login activity on android. This is my Main Activity class. I have a simple Activity layout with 3 buttons. One Google sign in button, one logout button and one revokeaccess button. When I run the app for the first time on my device, I get loggedin, and the signin button disappears. But when I tap the BACK button on my device and exit the app, and then tap on the app icon again, the app loads, and for about 1 second, I can still see the Google signin button, and then it disappears. I was wondering what would be the best way to avoid the user from seeing this button in the first place. The Google sign in button should not be visible at all if the user is already logged on, even for a split second.

Negative 5852 pI have been creating a game in sprite kit using swift and have encountered a problem. I have two view controllers, each with one scene and one transitions to the other modally. This all works perfectly first time round, but then when i return to the first view controller and then go to the second again, i have using double the memory. This gives me the impression that nothing is being deallocated, but the objects are rather reallocated every time I transition to the scene. I ran the app in instruments and got the same result. In the below image i moved from one scene to the next, and then back to the first one again and yet it appears to reallocate the first scene and yet not clear any memory. As the dealloc method is unused now, i dont see how i can fix this. I will post the code to the first view controller below so you can have a look at it.

Negative 5852 pI have made a procedure which inputs inventory information from a PowerShell script to a database.p  pEverything is executing smoothly except one thing. I need copy the values from one table to another history table whenever I run the script and then delete the older entries from the first table so that it has only the entries from the latest scan of values through the PowerShell script.

This is a logic error.p  pCan you please correct me so that when I run the script, all the entries just are present in the first table and only the entries from the time I last ran the script goes to the other table or do I need to create a new procedure for it, which I run only once just before the PowerShell loop is executedp  pStored procedurep  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeDELIMITER   DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS einv.insertvalue  CREATE PROCEDURE insertvalue   IN assetnamein varchar255,   IN attributenamein varchar255,   IN entryin varchar255,   IN valin int,   IN sc varchar255,   IN ip varchar255  BEGIN  DECLARE tempid INT DECLARE tempuid INT  INSERT INTO attributevaluehistory SELECT  FROM attributevalue  DELETE FROM attributevalue  SELECT u.uid INTO tempuid FROM usersystemmap u WHERE u.ipaddip  SELECT a.mapid INTO tempid FROM assetattributemap a INNER JOIN assetmaster b ON a.assetidb.assetid INNER JOIN attributemaster c ON a.attributeidc.attributeid WHERE b.assetnameassetnamein   AND c.attributenameattributenamein  INSERT INTO attributevalue    mapid,   entry,   uid,   valueid,   scantime  VALUES    tempid,   entryin,   tempuid,   valin,   castsc as datetime  END   DELIMITER  codepre  pPowerShell codep  pre classlangpsh prettyprintoverridecodecls MySQLAdminUserName  root MySQLAdminPassword  root MySQLDatabase  einv MySQLHost  egovpc3 ConnectionString  server  MySQLHost  port3306uid                      MySQLAdminUserName    pwd  MySQLAdminPassword                      databaseMySQLDatabase  [void][System.Reflection.Assembly]LoadWithPartialNameMySql.Data Connection  NewObject MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection Connection.ConnectionString  ConnectionString Connection.Open  SqlCommand  NewObject MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlCommand  arrgetcontent path DPowershellNew Foldera.txt foreachcomp in arr    ip[System.Net.Dns]GetHostAddressescomp select .ToString    count0   biosgwmi Win32UserAccount computername comp authentication packetprivacy     date  GetDate format yyyyMMdd HHMMss    date   foreachobj in bios      countcount1     Manufacturerobj.Manufacturer     Nameobj.Name     ReleaseDateobj.ConvertToDateTimeobj.ReleaseDate     SerialNumberobj.SerialNumber     Versionobj.Version                date  GetDate format yyyyMMdd HHmmss      date      SqlCommand.CommandText         call insertvalueUserAccount,Name,Name,count,date,ip     SqlCommand.Connection  Connection      SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery     codepre  pstrongEditstrong I would also like to know how to deploy a codeROLLBACKcode statement for this procedure if anything goes wrong and the history is not saved.p

Negative 5852 pI am currently studying a doctoral thesis in control theory. At the end of every chapter there is a simulation of a relativewiththesubject problem. I have finished the theory,but for further understanding I would like to reproduce the simulations. The first simulation is as follows p  pThe solution of the problem concludes in a system of differential equations whose right hand side consists of functions with unknown parameters. The author states the following  We will use neural networks with one hidden layer,sigmoid basis functions and 5 weights in the external layer in order to approximate every parameter of the unknown functions.More specifically, the weights of the hidden layer are selected through iterative trials and are kept stable during the simulation. And then he states the logic with which he selects the initial values of the unknown parameters and then shows the results of the simulation.p  pCould anyone give me a lead on where to look and what I need to know in order to solve this specific problem myself in MATLAB since this is the environment I am most familiar with Because the results of a google search are chaotic since I dont really know what Im looking for.p  pIf you need any more info,feel free to askp

Negative 5852 pI have two TFS servers.  One is a legacy TFS2010 server that contains an old collection of our projects.  Last year, we spun up a new TFS2012 server.

It tells me it cant connect to the target database server even though my production collection is attached to it on that box.p  pDoes anyone know if a collection migration from 2010 to 2012 is even possible or if Im just spinning my wheels  Theres no official documentation from Microsoft that I can find that says such a migration is even possible even though theres nothing I can find that refutes it eitherp  pServer Specsp  ul liOld SQL Server Enterprise 64 Bit 2008 SP3 10.0.5500li liNew SQL Server Enterprise 64 Bit 2008R2 SP2 10.50.4000li liOld TFS Server 10.0.40219.1 SP1 KB2182621li liNew TFS Server 11.0.60315.1 TFS2012 Update 2li ul

Negative 5852 pI am still a noob in web app development and sorry if this question might seem obvious for you guys.p  pCurrently I am developing a web application for my University using Python and Django. And one feature of my web app is to retrieve a large set of data in a table in the databasepostgreSQL, and displaying these data in a tabular form on webpage. Each column of the table need to have the sorting and filtering feature. The data set goes up to roughly 2 millions of rows. p  pSo I wonder if something like jpxGrid could help me to achieve such goal or it would be too slow to handlesortdisplayrender such a large data set on web page. I plan to retrieve all the data inside the table once only initiate one database query call and pass it into jpxGrid, however, my colleague suggests that each sort and filter should initiate a separate query call to the database to achieve better performancedatabase order by is very fast. I tried to use another open source jquery library that handles the form and enables sorting, filtering and pagingnon professional outdated one at the beginning, which starts to lag after 5k data rows and becomes impossible to use after 20k rows. p  pMy question is if something like jpxGrid is a good solution to my problem or I should build my own system that letting the database to handle the sorting and filteringprobably need to add the paging feature too. Thank you very much for helping.p

I think that, during serialization, the annotation emXmlElementem doesnt work, but im not sure that this is the correct reason. Another attempt i try to do is to put emJsonPropertymediatypesem annotation instead of emXmlElementem annotation but with no result in fact with this annotation i obtain also a Processing Exception.

Negative 5852 pSuppose a game, lets say, Mario. Now, I want to send highscore to server, but game is purely JavaScript based, so I will need to send data to server using AJAX or any other method, this will make use of GET and POST methods, right But problem is, both URL to which I have to submit details and parameters at least, name of parameters are readable by client. Now if someone goes through source code, he may find above said details. Lets say that i am sending variable called codehighScorecodeto page coderegisterScore.pycode. Now If someone learns that, then is it possible for him to send request directly to server through address bar or any other method which would be cheating in case of game. If yes, how can I restrict it Thanks for your help, sorry if I wasnt clear. p

I believe that my CSS file is somehow not allowing my submenu to pop left.  p  pWhat it is doing now is everything is vertical.  the submenu is hidden as desired but when hovered it pops down instead of to the left.  Please help me with this as I have been working on this for almost a week with no answer in sight.

Negative 5852 pIm debugging a program using Visual Studio 2012. It goes through the same functions multiple times using different parameters. As I learn more information from the debugging session sometimes I want to start over, but with the architecture we are using it would be easier to just finish running the piece of code it is going through than to stop the session and start again. But because it goes through the same functions repeatedly it keeps stopping at my breakpoints.p  pIs there a way to tell Visual Studio to finish running and ignore all remaining breakpoints without removing them for the next time I go through the code, and without stopping the debug session Ive tried to search for information on this but I didnt see anything.p  pThank you for your help.p

Negative 5852 pI have added few product features in Prestashop. One is Compatible BrandManufacturer, second is Compatible Series and third is Compatible Model. I associate them to products which are basically parts and each feature tells with which brand, series, and model it is compatible with. p  pWhat I want is a parentchild relation between these features. Brand as parent, series as child, and model as grand child. p  pFor example I am selling parts say RAM which is compatible with HP ProBook 4540s laptops. What I will do is select HP in Compatible Brands, Probook in Series, and 4540s and any other models in Model I already have module to enable multiple feature values. So, if I select HP then it should filter HP related series in Series feature and should not display the series of any other brand like Dell or IBM etc. Similarly if I select ProBook in series it should filter and display only Probook related models in the Model feature not the other ones.p

Negative 5852 pIm developing a WPF application and Im wondering if it is possible to prevent access to a specific procedure unless it has been called by another procedure. Specifically, I have a delete procedure in my data access layer that I only want to be run if certain validation procedures have already been performed.

Only layer with a dependency of the Data Access Layer Business Logic  For complex business logic. Presentation  Either makes a call to the business logic layer or if it is simple data access then the data repository layer.

I was looking at code access security and it looks like placing a deny on the Delete method and then using an assert in the validation method to override it would do what Im looking for. Im a little cautious around using security attributes for that so I wanted to see if that was a good option of if there might be a better way of handling this.p  pNote In case it matters to anyone, I am programming in VB.Net, but I can translate from C fairly easily.p

Rather that injecting codeuserscode into the controller, Id rather inject the codeUserDataServicecode and have the initialization completed in codeUserController.initcode.p  pThis code illustrates my desiresp  precodeangular.controllerUserController, [UserDataService, functionuserDataService     this.userDataService  userDataService   this.users  []   this.currentUser  null   this.otherUsersInMyGroup  []   this.supervisedUsers  []    this.init       Return a joined promise that aggregates each promise     return q.all[        this.userDataService.loadUsers       .thenfunction u  this.users  u .bindthis,        this.userDataService.getCurrentUser       .thenfunction u  this.currentUser  u .bindthis,         ... Other load promises for other members      ]        return this  ] codepre  pThis means I now need to be able to delay the route completion until the codeUserController.initcode method is complete. p  pHow is this compatible with the coderesolvecode approach in the routerp  pGiven the coderesolvecode functionality is aimed at providing parameters to the controllers constructor, its a bit of a chickenandegg situation... The controller must be created before I can call codecontroller.initcode, but the resolve mathods are evaluated before the controller is created, so the constructor parameters may be inejcted.p

Negative 5852 pOk, this is the problemp  pI have a search form where I have several input fields to specify a search request. I use Symfony2 forms to benefit from validation, CSRFprotection and all the good jazz.p  pNow, I want the URLs of the search results to be both SEO friendly and bookmarkable. e.g.p  precodehttpwww.example.combluecarinBerlin200km codepre  pMy current approach after doing some research is building the desired search slug and redirecting to another action like sop  precodesome form code ifsearchFormgtisValid    searchWidget  searchFormgtgetData     ifemptysearchWidgetgtgetSearch         slug  searchWidgetgtgetSearch    ifemptysearchWidgetgtgetPlace         slug . in . searchWidgetgtgetPlacegtgetName    ifemptysearchWidgetgtgetDistance         slug .  . searchWidgetgtgetDistance.km     return thisgtredirectToRouteappsearch, arraysearchgtslug  codepre  pWith the second controller which is basically supposed to look like thisp  precodepublic function searchActionRequest request, search      extract actual terms out of the search  slug     ....     find a way to inject the terms in the current requestObject dirty     ...     do all validation again  codepre  pAs already stated in the code this feels really inefficient and cumbersome. Isnt there a better way to do all this Like having a URL representation which is independent of the actual logicp  pFurthermore, is there even a clean solution to use all the benefits of symfony form without actual request parameters but with that request slug.p  pThanksp
Negative 5852 pI have an application that needs to run in the morning which wakes up the screen and in the evening it allows the screen to go blank.

Negative 5852 pIm trying to get a starting point on where to begin understanding what could cause a socket stall and would appreciate any insights any of you might have.p  pSo, server is a modern dual socket xeon 2 x 6 core  3.5 ghz running windows 2012. In a single process, there are 6 blocking tcp sockets with default options, each of which are running on their own threads not numacore specified. 5 of them are connected to the same remote server and receiving very heavy loads hundreds of thousands of small 75 byte msgs per second. The last socket is connected to a different server with a very light sendreceive load for  administrative messaging.p  pThe problem I ran into was a 5 second stall in the admin messaging socket. Multiple send calls to the socket returned successfully, however nothing was received from the remote server should receive a protocol ack within milliseconds or received BY the remote admin server for 5 seconds. It was as if that socket just turned off for a bit. After the 5 seconds stall passed, all of the acks came in a burst, and afterwards everything continued normally. During this, the other sockets were receiving much higher numbers of messages than normal, however there was no indication of any interruption or stall as the data logs displayed nothing unusual light logging, maybe 500 msgssec.p  pFrom what I understand, the socket send call does not ensure that data has gone out on the wire, just that a transfer to the tcp stack was successful. So, Im trying to understand the different scenarios that could have taken place that would cause a 5 second stall on the admin socket. Is it possible that due to the large amount of data being received the tcp stack was essentially overwhelmed and prioritized those sockets that were being most heavily utilized What other situations could have potentially caused thisp  pThank youp
Negative 5852 pMy colleagues and I have written a dozen web applications using Symfony2 and Propel1. We are now trying to use Propel2 but encounter the following problem when migrating an application from Propel1 to Propel2.p  pIn our simple schema, a parent object, codeAuteurcode author possesses a collection of children codeLivrecode book objects. We use a Symfony form to create the codeAuteurcode with a collection of codeLivrescode objects. In this case, the codeAuteurcode and codeLivrescode are correctly persisted in the database.p  pHowever, strongwhen we emupdateem the codeAuteurcode object without touching the collection of codeLivrescode, the collection is emptiedstrong.p  pWe could not determine whether this was a bug in Propel2 or less probably Symfony2 or if we are doing things incorrectly. The almost same code somewhat adapted to Propel1 works without a problem the codeLivrescode collection is emnotem emptied on codeAuteurcode update.p  pWe have published a minimal project reproducing the problem. To test it with Propel2, please dop  precodegit clone httpsgithub.comspyritMinimalS2P2.git cd MinimalS2P2 composer install appconsole propelbuild appconsole propelmigrationdiff appconsole propelmigrationmigrate codepre  pTo test it with emPropel1em, use to the codepropel1code branchp  precodegit checkout propel1 composer install appconsole propelbuild appconsole propelmigrationgeneratediff appconsole propelmigrationmigrate codepre  pWe will be grateful on any hint concerning this issue.p

I am using something like this p  precode   lttbody ngrepeatairport in filteredList  orderListlist  startFrom     currentPage1pageSize  limitTopageSizegt codepre  p  p  pThis is a plunker linka hrefhttpplnkr.coedit3kXXGIr5bDCboxTVt4Ulppreview relnofollowherea. Here it seems to be working fine ,my problem is it freezes when it started rendering table rows, even though it only has to render 25 rows ie per page records even all my watchers are set for current page records only . Am I missing something here. Inter page navigation is fine though.p
Negative 5852 pTHere are many questions on stack overflow on whether storing images in a db is worth it for big websites and most poeple say no. I am making a very small website which will only potentially hold 20 images. I have spent alot of time setting up images to be uploaded to a database so would around 20  200 images  around 10  50 KiB slow down my website if I have the images stored on a database as a BLOB file.p  pI also likes the structure of a db as I can easily AddEditDelete the images rather than going through the hassle of storing the images on a web server. p  pSo basically is uploading 20200 images that are around 10  50 KiB, will this slow down my website and how much slower would it getp

Negative 5852 pUsing iOS 9 and Xcode 7 beta 6 to build our app.p  pIn viewDidLoad we want to check the device type, and set the splitViewControllers preferredDisplayMode.  This worked on the simulator but not on real devices.p  pWe were using self.traitCollection and that was returning .Unspecified on a real device and .Pad on the simulator.  Also tried self.view.traitCollection while debugging.  We could get it to work correctly if we used UIScreen.mainScreen.traitCollection.p  pSo is this a bug, or do we have the wrong expectations for .trailCollection  I thought from the API that you could call that on UIScreen, UIWindow, UIViewController, UIPresentationController, and UIView, so I expected the same answers from any of them.  Also, since it works in the simulator, is this a bugp
