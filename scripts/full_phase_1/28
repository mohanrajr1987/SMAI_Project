Positive 28 pI want to convert a nested foreach loop in C to Linq. I know how to do it if the two lists are of same type. But in my case, they are of different type, except that they both have two common properties, DocumentId and IsValid. I have to loop through the outer list and the inner list and whenever the DocumentId of both are the same, then assign the IsValid value from the outer loop object to the inner loop object. I have the following foreach loop is working fine.p  precodeforeach var docs in outerDocuments       foreach var presentedDocuments in innerdocuments                  if docs.DocumentId.EqualspresentedDocuments.DocumentId                              presentedDocuments.IsValid  docs.IsValid                    codepre  pI need to convert it to Linq. Usually ReSharper does a good job of refactoring such code. But in this case it converted only the nested foreach to Linq, and even then it threw a warning , Access to foreach variable in closure.p  pThanksp

Positive 28 pWe have a jquery.jtable page that implements paging.  We noticed that the paging is not quite working.  For example, if there are 17 total items, the first page correctly shows 10 and the second shows 7. However, if there is a total of 20 items, the first page show 10 and the second shows only 8. We are usingp  preturn myQuery.SkipstartIndex.TakepageSize.ToListp  pOn the second page, the startindex  10 and the page size  10 and as I said above, it is only returning 8.  The culprit seems to be the .Take.

Fortunately, this particular table contains a small row count.p  pHas anyone else encountered this and found a better solutionp

I want to pull the people whom have had a job longer than 6 months. p  pWhat I have is thisp  precodepublic IQueryableltPersongt GetPeople gt     RepoltPersongt.Get.Selectp gt new Person               Name  p.Name,         Jobs  GetJobsp.Name     .Whereh gt h.Jobs.Count gt 0  public IQueryableltJobgt GetJobsstring name gt      RepoltJobgt.Get.Wherej gt j.name  name ampamp j.time gt 6 codepre  pThe problem is that this pulls every person, then queries for jobs for each of them, which is inefficient. Is there a good way of pulling jobs first, then creating a list of people, each with their own list of qualifying jobsp
Positive 28 pIm trying to get a sorted list using LINQ and Entity Framework, and Im getting some really weird results.  My code looks something like thisp  precode My class that corresponds to a database table class MyClass     public string FirstField  get set     public string SecondField  get set     public string ThirdField  get set     My Entity Framework code ListltMyClassgt firstList  from p in context.myObjects select p.OrderByp gt p.FirstField.ToList ListltMyClassgt secondList  firstList.OrderByp gt p.FirstField.ToList codepre  pWhen I look at my results, secondList is sorted correctly, but firstList is sorted incorrectly.  For the most part its sorted correctly, but some elements are out of order.  For instance, firstList would look something like thisp  precodeAAA BBB CCC DDD NNN   lt wrong order EEE FFF GGG PPP   lt wrong order HHH III codepre  pHowever, secondList is sorted entirely correctly.p  pIve examined the query that LINQ is creating, and the query has the correct ORDER BY.  I ran that same query in SQL Management Studio, and the results are ordered correctly in the same order as secondList, but not firstList.  Ive tried doing this using orderby in my LINQ query rather than using OrderBy, and the results are incorrect in the same way.p  pI dont understand whats going on here.  Shouldnt firstList be sorted, and shouldnt firstList and secondList both be the samep  pIm using Fluent API to map my objects to tables and properties to fields if that makes any difference.p

Positive 28 pEDIT  Summary after solution had been givenp  pLinq query results are almost always presented with emvarem implicit type or with typed emIENumerablelt Tem like emIEnumerablelt intem. However simple more  generic emIEnumerableem is sufficientp  pString.Join does not have specialization for emIEnumerableem  but has naturally one for emIEnumerablelt Tem  and fall back to emString.Join Method String, Object[] ...em. It then assumes that the linq query result emresem is an array of Object of size 1. I do not know why there is no overload for IEnumerablep  pEDITp  pI had imagine that it would be possible to write generic linq query return types. A first idea was to write a code like thisp  pre classlangC prettyprintoverridecodeclass exLinq      FuncltIEnumerablegt[] funlist  new FuncltIEnumerablegt[]       gt    int[]   data            1, 2, 5, 8, 11                  var     result         from d in data                                         where 0  d  2                                         select d                 return result                     gt Other queries that could be on string, double... collections              static void Mainstring args[]                       foreach var fun in funlist                      var f  fun             var res  f             Console.WriteLineString.Join, ,res                codepre  pHowever I got the resultp  blockquote   pSystem.Linq.EnumerableWhereArrayIterator1[System.Int32]p blockquote  pMy linq query return type would be more adequat with emIEnumerable lt int em  It works when I do this  but I was wondering if I could mix in the same arraylist queries that would have handle emstringsem,emdoubleem or whatsoever...p  pUp to now I got a correct code output with the modificationp  pre classlangC prettyprintoverridecodeif  res is IEnumerableltintgt     Console.WriteLineString.Join, ,res.Castltintgt codepre  blockquote   p2, 8p blockquote  pMore accustomed with C, I had believed that I would be able to handle any groups of object with the higher class.p  pAny idea of how to correctly achieve thisp

Positive 28 pIve recently swapped from using Lucene for Sitecore to Solr.p  pFor the most part it has been smooth, but the way I was writing some queries using Sitecore.ContentSearch.Linq abstraction now dont seem to be compatible.p  pSpecifically, I have a situation where Ive got global content and regional content, like sop  ul liHome 000  ul liXli liYli liZli ulli liRegions ID 111  ul liRegion 1 ID 221  ul liAli liBli ulli liRegion 2 ID 222  ul liDli ulli ulli ul  pMy code worked on Lucene, but now doesnt on Solr.

Negative 28 pWhat tools and procedures would you recommend or use yourself to help streamline the following sceanario I know its a long one but any help is appreciatedp  pI work in a team that have an ecommerce app that we develop at our company. Its a reasonably standard LAMP application that we have been developing on and off for about 3 years. We develop the application on a testing domain, here we add new features and fix bugs etc. Our bug tracking and feature development is all managed within a hosted subversion solution unfuddle.com. As bugs are reported we make these fixes on the testing domain and then commit changes to svn when we are happy the bug has been fixed. We follow this same procedure with the addition of new features.p  pIt is worth pointing out there the general architecture of our system and application across our servers. Each time a new feature is developed we roll this update out to all sites using our application always a server we control. Each site using our system essentially uses exactly the same files for 95 of the codebase. We have a couple of folders within each site which contain files bespoke to that site  css files  images etc. Other than that the differences between each site are defined by various configuration settings within each sites database.p  pThis gets on to the actual deployment itself. As and when we are ready to roll out an update of some kind we run a command on the server that the testing site is on. This performs a copy command cp fru testsite othersite and goes through each vhost force updating the files based on modified date. Each additional server that we host on has a vhost that we rsync the production codebase to and we then repeat the copy procedure on all sites on that server. During this process we move out the files we dont want to be overwritten, moving them back when the copy has completed. Our rollout script performs a number of other function such as applying SQL commands to alter each database, adding fields  new tables etc.p  pWe have become increasingly concerned that our process is not stable enough, not faulttolerant and is also a bit of a bruteforce method. Were also aware we are not making best use of subversion as we have a position where working on a new feature would prevent us from rolling out an important bug fix as we are not making use of branches or tags. It also seems wrong that we have so much replication of files across our servers. Were also not able to easily perform a rollback on what we have just rolled out. We do perform a diff before each rollout so we can get a list of files that will be changed so we know what has been changed after but the process to rollback would still be problematic. In terms of the database ive started looking into dbdeploy as a potential solution. What we really want though is some general guidance about how we can improve our file management and deployment. Ideally we want the file management to be more closely linked to our repository so a rollout  rollback would be more connected to svn. Something like using the export command to make sure the site files are the same as the repo files. It would also be good though if the solution maybe would also stop the file replication around our servers.p  pIgnoring our current methods it would be really good to hear how other people approach the same problem.p  pto summarise...p  pWhat is the best way for making files across multiple servers stay in sync with svnp  pHow should we prevent file replication symlinks  something elsep  pHow should we structure our repo so we can dev new features and fix old onesp  pHow should we trigger rolloutsrollbacksp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 28 pDatabinding in WPFSilverlight revolves around dependency properties, codeDataContextcode objects and codeDataSourcecode objects.

Negative 28 pIm having a strange problem with anchor tags shifting divs upwards which is causing quite a bit of headache, but because there are so many different pieces in the mix, I dont know which one is causing the issue.  Im attempting to build a UI that uses a modal dialog box from the a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemosdialogmodal relnofollowjQuery UIa library  to display a horizontal accordion style menu.  The basic format of the code is as followsp  precodeltdiv ididentifier classprofilePanelgt    ltulgt       ltligt          ltdiv classcardgt              ltdiv classheadergtlth1gtHeaderlth1gtltdivgt              ltdiv classcontentgt                  ltContent goes here gt              ltdivgt          ltdivgt       ltligt       ltligt         ...       ltligt    ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pEach card is designed so that when you click on it the currently expanded card shrinks in width and the new card grows in width.  This is all done in javascript assisted by jQuery.  Each cards additional content is hidden via overflowhidden in the css, and only the header div within the card is visible when shrunk.  The relevant css is as followsp  precodeul  liststyle none margin 0 padding 0   div.profilePanel      display none   div.profilePanel li      float left   div.profilePanel li div.card      overflow hidden     height 375px     width 30px     backgroundcolor e0f3fb     padding 0px 2px 2px 0px   div.profilePanel li p  margin 0 padding 0 display block marginleft 35px   div.header      borderwidth 1px     borderstyle solid     bordercolor red     display block     float left     width 30px     height 100     cursor pointer   div.content      padding 5px 10px     height 365px     overflow auto  div.content li      display block     float none   h1      float left     webkittransform rotate90deg     moztransform rotate90deg     direction rtl     fontsize 14pt     margintop 5px     whitespace nowrap     width 30px     textalign center     overflow visible  codepre  pNow if the content div contains no anchor tags ie. I could take anchor tags and rename them to spans to get the proper formatting if not functionality the menu displays as expected.  Each header takes up the entire card size, and everything is properly formatted within the cards.  However, if the content div contains an anchor tag, both the header and content divs are shifted up on the page.  Using firebug, I can tell that the card div has actually not moved, but the header and content ones have.  Since this is in a modal dialog box, I thought it had something to do with that but the two divs seem to be shifted in relation to the position of the dialog box no matter where I drag it to.p

Negative 28 pNOTE Please read the whole thing before posting, youll see why.p  pSo I have an OpenGLWinAPI application. Im doing what you would expect, by doing cycles of handling messages, then rendering a frame, handling messages, rendering frame...p  pThe trouble is, when I resize or move a window, the screen freezes, and it can look quite ugly. I know from previous expirements with OpenGL that limiting the number of messages to be processed between frames either by number or time does the trick. It seems windows is blocking my app whenever it movesresizes the window. From expirimenting, I do know that putting the windows message handling into another thread and forgetting about it works quite well, and helps with the timing aswell.p  pMy question is Is there any better, less destructive, or nonthreaded way of doing this Is there any downside to what I am doing besides the multithreading dramas. I would love to know if multithreading is avoidable.p  pThanks, Alexp

Whether to have time zone support ONOFF, a set time zone, etc.p  pSo if I am in California and add an event to the device and the time zone is set to New York and time zone support is ON, what time will the EKEvent actually show inp  pHas anyone dealt with the iOS calendar via EventKit and have lessons to learn regarding time zone handling  Or is it straightforward, just use the local time and enter the event and the device will take care of the restp  pThank you.p
Negative 28 pWhen writing a a hrefhttpwww.linux.comarchivefeature114134 relnofollowNautilus Scripta e.g. using Python, I currently am aware of two methods for basic debuggingp  ol liUsing e.g. Zenity popup windows as print statements.li liCapturing stderr and stdout in text files for later reference.li ol  pThese methods work reasonably well, but I suspect that there are more effective methods that I am not aware of.  Can anyone suggest other methodsp  pEditp  pContext  I sought methods to debug a python script launched from the Ubuntu right click menu in Nautilus.  p  pUsing cedrics answer of relaunching nautilus with nodesktop option means that stderr and stdout becomes visible at the terminal window.

Each square also has an [x,y] list position variable and rbg color.p  pMy question is how to organize this all with classes Im trying to learn OOP. Logically, it seems that each frame contains squares, and each square contains variables like position, letter and color. But I suppose you could even think of it as each square contains 4 frames... My guess is make a frame class, and put 4 instances of it in a list if theres 4 frames and somehow make each frame instance contain a list of 16 square instances. Maybe usable like codeframes[2].squares[5].letter  fcode Just a fuzzy idea Im too new at OOP to know if thats remotely correct or a good idea. But it would be helpful to see how someone who knows what theyre doing would organize all this. Thanksp

Negative 28 pIm running a VB.NET application 24 hours a day on a dedicated machine. Id like to be able to receive status updates and also controldebug the application remotely i.e. from another computer via the internet.p  pIt would be an advantage if the communication was lightweight in terms of bytes sent and received so I can control the thing without needing a fast internet connection. Also, Im running the application from within the IDE at the moment because there are some unhandled exceptions and its easier to debug this way.

If all went to plan Id just set the application off and reading some sort of log would be fine. The problem is that it is unstable mainly because it calls a web service which is very unstable and returns all sorts of weird things and therefore seems to need constant input on my part.p  pIt was my thinking that the only way I could do this sort of debugging remotely is by catching every error I could, reading the log, and somehow instructing the application to behave properly in future.p

Negative 28 pI have a codeUITableViewControllercode that Id like to notify once the data of the corresponding model is ready to be displayed. The problem is that this data is fetched from a web service and the request can take up to several seconds. Currently, Im fetching the data synchronously on the main thread which, of course, causes my main thread to block. Now, I dont want my controller to know anything about downloading data from the internet. How can I accomplish this. Currently, Im thinking about utilizing GCD and implementing a method like codeloadDataWithCallbackcode and provide a callback that triggers a code[tableView reloadData]code on success. Is this a good approach Are there other possibilities to notify a controller that the model is ready An other idea I had was to use a delegate mechanism and setting the controller as a delegate of my modelp  pTo summarize, whats better GCD with callbacks or implementing your own delegate mechanismp  pAre there other possibilitiesp  hr  pemUpdateem June, 24th 2011 1315 CETp  pAfter reading all your replies, I come to the conclusion that there are 3 possible solutions to my problemp  ol lipMake use of codeNSNotificationscode and use codeNSURLConnectioncode to implement async. downloadpli lipImplement a custom protocol and use a delegation mechanism. Again, use codeNSURLConnectioncode to implement async. download.pli lipUse synchronous download in a separate GCD queue and use callbacks.pli ol  pSince nobody favors the last solution, I want to discuss this approach a little in depth. After seeing all the code that is involved in notification handling, I think that GCD is a better approach. Instead of agreeing on a certain notification which has to be somehow documented, so that every developer knows about it, I can simply use a callback. On the one hand, it gives me a clear interface like one I would have when I would use a delegate, on the other hand, it give me total flexibility. Do you really think that GCD is to complicated for this Here is my codep  precode voidloadRestaurantsWithCallbackvoid callback      dispatchqueuet currentqueue  dispatchgetcurrentqueue     dispatchqueuet downloadqueue  dispatchqueuecreateDownload queue, NULL      dispatchasyncdownloadqueue,          self.restaurants  [self loadRestaurants]         dispatchasynccurrentqueue,  callback            dispatchreleasedownloadqueue  codepre  pBtw., my application simply displays the menus of the different canteens at my university.p  pIn my controller, I simply do the followingp  precodeif [self.canteen hasRestaurants]      [self.canteen loadRestaurantsWithCallback         [self.tableView reloadData]     ]  codepre  pIt works like a charm. What do you think about this solutionp  hr  pemUpdateem June, 24th 2011 1630 CETp  pThere is a fourth solution to this problem and its probably the way to go even if it involves more code than the GCD approach.

Negative 28 pIm doing my final project for my algorithms course in C.  For the project, we have to take an input text file that contains lines likep  precodePA0 codepre  porp  precodeE012 codepre  pThe former indicates a vertex to be added to the graph were using in the program, the 2nd token being the name of the vertex, and the last token being its index in the vertices[] array of the graph struct.p  pIve got a while loop going through this program line by line, it takes the first token to decide whether to make a vertex or an edge, and then proceeds accordingly.p  pWhen I finish the file traversal, I call my showvertices function, which is just a forloop that prints each name gvertices[i].name sequentially.p  pThe problem is that where the name should go in the output s, I keep getting the last token1 I collected.  In the case of the particular input file Im using it happens to be the source node of the last edge in the list...which is odd because there are two other values passed through the strtok function afterward.  The line in the file looks likep  precodeE671 codepre  pwhich creates an edge from indexes 6 to 7 with a weight of 1.  The edge comes up fine.  But when I call any codeprintfcode with a s, it comes up 6.  Regardless.p  pThis is the file traversal.p  precodefgetscurrLn, sizeofcurrLn, infile maxv  atoicurrLn ifmaxv  0      file not formatted correctly, print error message     return   tgraph g  newgraphmaxv, TRUE  whilefgetscurrLn, sizeofcurrLn, infile  NULL      token1  strtokcurrLn,      key  token1[0]      ifkey  P  key  p              token1  strtokNULL,          ifaddvertexg, token1                      file integration fail, throw error             return                  If I print the name here, it works fine and gives me the right name         continue          ifkey  E  key  e              token1  strtokNULL,          token2  strtokNULL,          token3  strtokNULL,          src  atoitoken1         dst  atoitoken2         w  atoitoken3          ifaddedgeg, src, dst, w                      file integration fail, throw error             return                  continue          else              epic error message because user doesnt know what theyre doing.         return       codepre  pIf I run codeshowverticescode here, I get  p  precode0. 6   1. 6   2. 6   etc... codepre
Negative 28 pI am looking for a Drupal module that makes onpage notifications similar to those found on Stackoverflow slide on from top or Gmail appears near top of page. Ive looked through the secondary modules associated with notifications and messaging projects, and havent found this. The module needs to be able to hook into other core modules in order to be triggered by events and send useful messages i.e. im not looking for just the javascript to do a popup. BTW this is for Drupal 6.  Thank youp
Negative 28 pIm trying to persist my data but am having trouble coming up with a schema that will work for hibernate in a sane wayp  pI have two objects a channel and user. The user is associated with the channel but in many ways. It can have 5 special statuses and can be assigned multiple ones or be normal. The issue is complicated by the fact that its a many to many relationship a user can be in multiple channels and a channel has multiple users.p  pMy idea is to have separate channel and user tables but have a third big map table.

Negative 28 pIm currently trying to most efficiently do an inplace multiplication of an array of complex numbers memory aligned the same way the stdcomplex would be but currently using our own ADT by an array of scalar values that is the same size as the complex number array.p  pThe algorithm is already parallelized, i.e. the calling object splits the work up into threads.  This calculation is done on arrays in the 100s of millions  so, it can take some time to complete.  CUDA is not a solution for this product, although I wish it was.  I do have access to boost and thus have some potential to use BLASuBLAS.p  pIm thinking, however, that SIMD might yield much better results, but Im not familiar enough with how to do this with complex numbers.

Ive tried STL and transform, which game close results, but still worse.  Ive also tried casting to stdcomplex and allow it to use the overloaded operator for scalar  complex for the multiplication but this ultimately produced the same results.p  pSo, anyone with any ideas  Much appreciation is given for your time in considering this  Target platform is Windows.

Negative 28 pSo, I have a Sales Fact table, that is based on the transaction lifecycle model or accumulating fact snapshot table, with very many different date key columns, like sales date, refunded date, etc. I made different measures for each of the date columns, i.e. Sum of NonEmpty sales date key column is the [Number of Sales], and Sum of NonEmpty refunded date key column is the [Number of Refunds], etc. Each of the date key columns are related to different date key dimensions. The sales date dimension and the refunded date dimension are role playing dimensions, all based on the same DimDate table. There are other nondate based dimensions as well, but for the sake of this example, I will keep it simple  there is another additional dimension for storeType retail, ecommerce, etcp  pWhen I browse the cube as most users will browse and explore the cube via excel I can drag the [Number of Sales] and [Number of Refunds] to the columns section, and then I can drag the StoreType dimension in the rows section, and it displays the data properly as suchp  pre code                  Number of Sales   Number of Refunds  Retail           10                8 eCommerce        5                 2 code pre  pThis is fine, because I havent applied any date filters so it displays everything. Ive confirned the data in the Fact table, and indeed, the numbers are right.p  pBut then I want to apply the same date filter to both the [Number of Sales] and [Number of Refunds]  so I drag both those dimensions to the filter area, and apply the same date filter to both  and of course, the numbers are all the same for both the columnsp  pre code                  Number of Sales   Number of Refunds  Retail           5                 4 eCommerce        5                 4 code pre  p.. because I think by effectively applying one date towards both the date dimensions, I am filtering down to the same set of rows being that they are from the same table. I know this is incorrect, because I can query the individual rows from the Fact table and see that they have different values.p  pBasically, what I want is to show the two columns together, but really they dont have anything in common. I could possibly even have two different date filters on each column, i.e. show all sales for fiscal year 2010 and show all refunds for fiscal year 2011. This is again, completely browsable by the user, so the measures must be made available without having to do complicated MDX queries. p  pI guess I can create another fact table to house the same data in a transactional fact table, and I can then count it individually  but that makes no sense to have two separate fact tables to more or less count the same thing.p  pAny idea how to do this helpp

Negative 28 pSuppose we have a stage with two squares, like so img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwVifT.png altOur example Flash stagep  pSuppose wed like the yellow square to be initially hidden, and wed like that as long as the mouse cursor is inside the bounds of the red square  the yellow square will be visible, and as long as the mouse cursor is out of the bounds of the red square  that the yellow square will be hidden.p  pThe intuitive approach is to write something like thisp  precodeinSqr.visible  false outSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOVER,sqrOver outSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT,sqrOut  function sqrOvereMouseEvent      inSqr.visible  true   function sqrOut eMouseEvent      inSqr.visible  false  codepre  pWith this code, however  any time you move the mouse cursor to within the strongyellow squarestrong   it, apparently, counts as a strongROLLOUTstrong for the strongREDstrong square   thus the sqrOut function is triggered  making the yellow square disappear, and once the yellow square is not there  the cursor is suddenly within the bounds of the strongREDstrong square again  so the sqrOver function gets called  bringing back the yellow squares visibility  triggering sqrOut and so on and so forth, thus creating a flickering yellow square when the mousecursr is over him the yellow square disappears and reappears repeatedly over and over again.p  pA possible fix for this is to remove the listener for the reds rollout event while the cursor is inside the yellow if its inside the yellow it surely is inside the red as well, and bring it back when it is out, by adding this to the code abovep  precode inSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOVER,insqrOver  inSqr.addEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT,insqrOut  function insqrOvereMouseEvent       if outSqr.hasEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT           outSqr.removeEventListenerMouseEvent.ROLLOUT,sqrOut            inSqr.visible  true    function insqrOuteMouseEvent       if outSqr.hasEventListener MouseEvent.ROLLOUT           outSqr.addEventListenerMouseEvent.ROLLOUT,sqrOut         codepre  pThis works. But it is cumbersome. You have to do it for each any object inside the bounds of the red square  resulting in long code and many event listeners and continuous listenerregistration and unregisteration.p  pbr A few years ago someone suggested to me this techniquep  precode outSqr.addEventListener Event.ENTERFRAME,hoverCheck   function hoverCheck eEvent       if e.currentTarget.hitTestPointstage.mouseX,stage.mouseY,true           inSqr.visible  true            else           inSqr.visible  false         codepre  pThis is a simple short code that works. But, if your project doesnt really need to use the ENTERFRAME event it creates the unnecessary overhead and cpucycles of repeatedly running the hit test. Also, if the red square covers the entire stage has the same dimensions as the stage   it creates problems strongit doesnt workstrong.p  pbrp  pIs anyone aware of a simple elegant way to accomplish this  one that would not involve  too cumbersome and long code and that would not have to use a repeated timer that hittests over and over again...p

Negative 28 pI have a question about a strongmodeling, trainingstrong classes, there are two simple rules which do not fit in my head, and that such training should provide,p  pin my model, be it codeCustomersModelcode, codeVehicleModelcode I have to have access to the methods of the writer of queries codeSQLBuildercode, but also have access to the database, which would not set the mapper as the mapper works on the bench, and not the bank over the mapper, so complicated a little by my situation.p  pImagine the followingp  precodeltphp     database access, mapping    abstract class Mapper      abstract class Model         interface Connection    to recognize its a database access     class MySQL implements Connection      class PgSQL implements Connection          SQL Helper, some methods to write a update, insert, delete, select query    class SQLBuilder        my custom models    class Customers extends Model   codepre  pvisualizing this structure, the Customers, already has access to the mapper, in which case I would have a property codetablecode among others in the Customers table to recognize that this model works, but .. I do not have access to the writer of queries, and not to the database, for this, I thought of a method codemaincode, where setaria connection to the database, using the codesetDatabaseConnection  Connection connection code but the code would be often repeated, just imagine for N models, all using  setDatabaseConnectiom, and the entire application uses only one database .. p  pMy question is basically that, provide access to the database without using setter method in model codeCustomers, Vehiclecode, and the writer of queries right away.p  pWay i want to use is ..p  precodeltphp          my models        class Customers extends Model                   method of mapper doesnt implement               public function getByCity  city                        query  thisgtselectgtfromthisgttablegtwherecity  , city                      resultSet  thisgtgetConnectiongtquery query                       if  resultSetgtrowCount gt 1                               return resultSetgtfetchAll                       else return resultSetgtfetch                         codepre  pso how can I use the codesave code, codedelete code, codeupdate code the mapper. in this case, the codegetConnection code method would have to get the default connection, and return the class.p

Negative 28 pI have a website where we use the request dialog to allow users to invite their friends to check us out.  From the inviters side everything works as expected.  The person being invited does get the notification, but it is immediately deleted.  So they would see the red 1 over the globe for only a half a second, but it immediately dissapears and the message does not stay in their list of notifications.  They do get the invite in the apps and games section.  This used to work, but for some reason it has stopped.  Is this possibly a config thing with the app settings within facebook Any insight would be appreciated.p

Negative 28 pI have a c code which runs through about 200 ASCII files, does some basic data processing, and outputs a single ASCII file with basically all of the data.p  pThe program runs very quickly at first, then slows down drastically part way through, perhaps slows gradually a little more, then procedes at a fairly slow pace through the rest.  I.e. it gets through the first 80 files in about 5 seconds, 200 total files in about 50 seconds.  Each file is basically the same.p  pIm looking for suggestions on how to track down the problem or memory leak.p  hr  pSome more details At first I would fopenFILE outputFile, w at the beginning of my program, and fclose at the end.  the first 40 files would take  4 seconds then about 1.5 minutes for 200 files.p  pI thought maybe the output file was clogging the memory, so I changed the code to fopenoutputFile, a each iteration i.e. each time I opened a new file, and fclose eachtime I closed the input file... this increased the performance to 50 seconds total, as mentioned above.p  pIt seems strange that this fix would help so noticeably, but not entirely.p  pAlso, Im not dynamically allocating any memory no calls to new or delete or free or whatever.... so Im not even sure how I could emhaveem a memory leak.p  pAny help would be appreciated Thanksp  hr  pCodep  precodevectorltstringgt dirCon  Uses boostfilesystem to store every file in directory bool retVal  FileSystemgetDirectoryContentsHOMEDIRHISTORYDIR, ampdirCon, 2  int counter  0 forint i  0 i lt dirCon.size i        Create output file     FILE outFile     string outputFileName  HOMEDIR ...       open file as append a     bool ifRet  initFileoutFile, outputFileName.cstr, a     ififRet          fprintfstderr, ERROR ...          return false                   Get the topmost directory name     sizet loc  dirCon.ati.findlastof     string dirName  dirCon.ati.substrloc1, dirCon.ati.sizeloc1       Get the top directory content     vectorltstringgt subDirCon     bool subRetVal  FileSystemgetDirectoryContentsdirCon.ati, ampsubDirCon     ifsubRetVal  fprintfstderr, ERRORn return false        Go through each file in directory, look for the one that matches     forint j  0 j lt subDirCon.size j            Get filename         loc  subDirCon.atj.findlastof         string fileName  subDirCon.atj.substrloc1, subDirCon.atj.sizeloc1           If filename matches desired station, process and store         if fileName  stringdirName ...

Negative 28 pIm trying to rasterize and fill a hypersphere. In essence, I have a ddimensional grid of fixed size and a sphere center, radius and want to find out which cells of the grid overlap with the sphere and store their coordinates.p  pI am aware of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMidpointcirclealgorithm relnofollowMidpoint circle algorithma which takes advantage of 8way mirroring and produces the outer cells border of a circle. I have also altered the linked wikipedia code so as to fill the circle that is, to produce the coordinates of all cells inside the border.p  pHowever I am unaware of any algorithms for higher dimension. For example in 4d, Ive been thinking of implementing by producing all possible circles like in the following pseudocode. The basic idea is that since a 4d sphere is xx0em2  yy0em2  zz0em2  kk0em2  rem2, this is equal to xx0em2  yy0em2  rem2  zz0em2  kk0em2. Since I know how to draw a circle, i just need to produce all circles for all possible values of z and k. p  precodeassume centerx0,y0,z0,k0 and radius r  for all dimensions equal or higher than 2this is z and k   make a list of possible values this dimension can take   from z0 to z0radius with a step of 1   alllists.append[dim0,dim01,...,dim0radius]  produce the product of all the lists in alllists now i have a list [[z0,k0],[z0,k01],....,[z01,k0],[z01,k01],....,[z0radius,k0],...[z0radius,k0radius]]  for every element l of the list, compute the radius of the circular cut   l.appendr2  z2  k2  Now call the Midpoint Circle Algorithm, but for every x,y pair that it produces, we need to export 4 points, namely x,y,z,k codepre  pThis a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3613190needanalgorithmtopixelateanndimensionalhyperspherequestiona seems relevant, but I dont understand the answer.p

Negative 28 pI am making a classified ads site with Zend Framework for portfolio purposes, yes I know the world doesnt have room for yet another Craigslist clone. I am trying to implement the ability to posteditdelete without ever needing an account.p  pTo do this, I feel like I need to have a Nonce generated upon post submission and stored in the database. Then email a link to the user which makes a GET request for the delete, like thisp  blockquote   pa hrefhttpwww.somesite.compostdeleteid123ampnonce2JDXS93JFKS8204HJTHSLDH230945HSLDF relnofollowhttpwww.somesite.compostdeleteid123ampnonce2JDXS93JFKS8204HJTHSLDH230945HSLDFap blockquote  pOnly the user has this unique key or nonce, and upon submission I check the database under the posts ID and ensure the nonce matches prior to deleting.p  pMy issue is how secure the nonce actually is. If I use Zend Frameworks codeZendFormElementHashcode, it creates the hash like thisp  precodeprotected function generateHash      thisgthash  md5         mtrand1,1000000          .  thisgtgetSalt          .  thisgtgetName          .  mtrand1,1000000          thisgtsetValuethisgthash  codepre  pIn reading about mtrand, a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.mtrand.php105587 relnofollowone commenter saida emThis function has limited entrophy. So, if you want to create random string, it will produce only about 2 billion different strings, no matter the length of the string. This can be serous security issue if you are using such strings for session indentifiers, passwords etc.em p  pDue to the lifetime of the noncetoken in the application, which could be days or weeks before user chooses to delete post, I think more than enough time would be given for a potential hack. p  pI realize codemtrandcode is a huge upgrade from coderandcode as seen in a hrefhttpoi43.tinypic.comvwtppl.jpg relnofollowthis visuala mapping pixels with coderandcode on the left, and codemtrandcode on the right.

Negative 28 pIm developing a application using Java RMI which enable clients to register topics they want to listen zero or more and topic zero or one they want to speak about.

Clients and server work according to Observer pattern.p  pCallback interfacesp  precodepublic interface ListenerCallback extends Remote  void notifyString topic, String msg throws RemoteException     public interface SpeakerCallback extends Remote  Unregister acceptListenerCallback listenerCallback throws RemoteException   codepre  pFragment of registration method on server, both speaker and listener are remote referencesp  precodefor SpeakerCallback speaker  registeredSpeakers     try          speaker.acceptlistener      catch RemoteException e         TODO should I unregister speaker       codepre  pAs written above in TODO, I suppose I should unregister speaker from my application registries, because as far as I know RemoteException indicates that the connection with client is broken.p  pThe problem Im struggling with is how should I manage abnormal client shutdown that only listen to some topic but speak about none. The server holds them in application registries, but has no way to determine whether they are still valid, because it doesnt call its notify method.p  pShoud I add some bogus method to ListenerCallback interface just for trying to determine whether client is still reachablep  pOr should I implemented a protocol which would enable clients who speak about these call notify method a certain topic notify server that some listening clients are no more availablep

Negative 28 pstrongThe Scenariostrong We have multiple nodes distributed geographically on which we want to have queues collecting messages for that location. And then we want to send this collected data from every queue in every node to their corresponding queues in a central location. In the central node, we will pull out data collected in the queues from other nodes, process it and store it persistently.p  pConstraintsp  ul liData is very important to us. Therefore, we have to make sure that we are not loosing data in any case.li liTherefore, we need persistent queues on every node so that even if the node goes down for some random reason, when we bring it up we have the collected data safe with us and we can send it to the central node where it can be processed.li liSimilarly, if the central node goes down, the data must remain at all the other nodes so that when the central node comes up we can send all the data to the central node for processing.  li liAlso, the data on the central node must not get duplicated or stored again. That is data collected on one of the nodes should be stored on the central nodes only once.li liThe data that we are collecting is very important to us and the order of data delivery to the central node is not an issue.li ul  pstrongOur Solutionstrong We have considered a couple of solutions out of which I am going to list down the one that we thought would be the best. A possible solution in our opinion is to use Redis to maintain queues everywhere because Redis provides persistent storage. Then perhaps have a daemon running on all the geographically separated nodes which reads the data from the queue and sends it to the central node. The central node on receiving the data sends an ACK to the node it received the data from because data is very important to us and then on receiving the ACK, the node deletes the data from the queue. Of course, there will be timeout period in which the ACK must be received.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong The above stated solution according to us will work fine but the issue is that we dont want to implement the whole synchronization protocol by ourselves for the simple reason that we might be wrong here. We were unable to find this particular way of synchronization in Redis. So we are open to other AMQP based queues like RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, etc. Again we were not able to figure out if we can do this with these solutions.p  ul liDo these Message Queues or any other data store provide features that can be the solution to our problem If yes, then howli liIf not, then is our solution good enoughli liCan anyone suggest a better solutionli liCan there be a better way to do thisli liWhat would be the best way to make it fail safeli liThe data that we are collecting is very important to us and the order of data delivery to the central node is not an issue.li ul

Negative 28 pSuppose we have an app that works for mobile phones.

Negative 28 pAlright I was looking at this in python but I just like ruby better. What Im trying to do is get a date and time from this number  12988822998637849  which is the number of microseconds since January 1, 1601 UTC. This is how Chrome stores its timestamps and ive seen a number of methods to do this in python, but I am just more comfortable with ruby and I have no idea on how to even start going about doing this. My GoogleFu didnt help me this time Note this example number is from a few days ago. Ill take any help I can get. Thank youp

Negative 28 pIm using PHP 5.4.4 and Im getting very strange behavior with the FuelPHP ORM save and update functions.p  pIm trying to save either serialized or JSON data to a field in the database so something like codenamemichaelcode. When I use the codemodelgtsavecode directly after codeModelforgecode it seems to work fine 100 of the time and the string you see is the one that gets stored in the MySQL db.p  pHowever, if I immediately change something like modelproperty  new property not the JSON or serialized data property and then do another codemodelgtsavecode it will 90 of the time turn all my codecode into codeampquotcodep  pIt seems that when I debug the issue and step through line by line, it will not reproduce this problem It will make through the entire script and still have the correct codecode instead of codeampquotcodep  pThis problem is driving me nuts. I would assume its a configuration thing or there would be a lot more complaints, but I cant find the right switch. Ive set both  codephpflag magicquotesgpc Offcode and codephpflag magicquotesruntime Offcode in my .htaccess although it shouldnt be needed in PHP 5.4 and verified that both are false.p  pIm out of ideas here.

Negative 28 pI have a table of about 1,000 records.  Around half of them will utilise a set of fields containing certain characteristics.  Theres about 10 relevant fields.  The other half of the records wont need that information filled in.p  pThis table is central to the database and will be taking the bulk of the operations.  Though at only around 1,000 records, its not much.p  pThe hardware that the database is stored on is old and slow spinning hard drive not SSD...  so I want to have a fairly optimised structure to make the most of it.  Obviously the increased size of the database alone due to the blank fields isnt a major concern, but if its slowing down queries then thats not good.p  pI guess I should describe the setup.  Currently Access 2007 client and Access backend, though the backend will soon move to SQL server.  Currently the backend is on the main server rack, but when moved to SQL Server it will get its own older server rack.p  pSo should I make a separate table to store the aforementioned set of characteristics, or should I leave it as isp

Negative 28 pIve been working with d3 for a while now in an attempt to create an interactive ecosystem explorer tool that maps out relationships between species.

Negative 28 pBasically what Im doing is building a desktop application that needs to connect to a web server, perform some calculations, and then have the resulting values sent back to it. The calculations change over time, and also need to stay somewhat secure, which is why Im not just coding them into the desktop application.p  pThe issue is that only authenticated users should be allowed to access the server. So what Im looking for is a way to login to Django from my desktop application i.e. the desktop application will pop up a window asking for a username and password, which will then be sent to the Django site, used to authenticate the user, and if valid, will return the results of the computation. It also needs to work as a session the user enters their password at the beginning and then doesnt need to login again until they close the desktop application, even if multiple computations are performed.p  pI think I need to use session keys for this, and perhaps the RemoteUserMiddleware described a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevhowtoauthremoteuser relnofollowherea but I really have no idea where to start as far as coding this. Any suggestions or pointers in the right direction would be hugely appreciated.p  pThanks, Moragp  pP.S. If this is important, the desktop application is written in VB.NET.p

Negative 28 pThis may be a bad question, but Ive noticed that as Im writing coding along using mootools When Ive got some code that goes through callbacks, bindings and generally isnt just a straight forward function call, if theres an error it doesnt get picked up by either Firebug or Chromes console it just silently fails, and Im forced to track down the error using trys and such that dont give you handy information like the line of code thats failing. Its like writing code for IE6 all you have to go on is some opaque message like can not read x of undefined. p  pI realize that the question isnt specific enough to ask how do I avoid this but does anyone else run into this problem and if so how do you work around it Im also a little confused how an error could be picked up by a trycatch block, but not the javascript console. p  pEDITp  pOK, Ive come up with something that reproduces the errorp  psay youve got a function p  precodefunction foo    var x  value.blah  codepre  pif I call that function like codefoocode I rightly get an reference error in my console.

Negative 28 pI have a class codeFoocode, which I do not implement directly, but wrap external libraries e.g codeFooXternal1code or codeFooXternal2code  One way that I have seen to do this, is using preprocessor directives asp  precodeinclude config.h include foo.h ifdef FOOXTERNAL1WRAPPER implementation of class Foo using FooXternal1 endif  ifdef FOOXTERNAL2WRAPPER implementation of class Foo using FooXternal2 endif codepre  pand a codeconfig.hcode is used to define these preprocessor flags codeFOOXTERNAL1WRAPPERcode and codeFOOEXTERNAL2WRAPPERcode. I have the impression this is frowned upon by the C programmer community because it uses preprocessor directives, is hard to debug, etc. Further, it does not allow for the parallel existence of both implementations.p  pI thought about making codeFoocode a base class and inheriting from it to allow for both implementations to exist in parallel with each other.

Negative 28 pThere is a very easy trick which creates a dictionarylike structure where keys are types. The structure acts like a codeDictionaryltType, Tgtcode where keys are codeTypecode objects and values are instances of the corresponding types.p  pThis  wonderful structure is as fast as just a variable or array since the lookup is only done once by the compilerJITter and the proper value reference is compiled into your program.p  precode    public static class MyDictltTgt          public static T Value  get set       codepre  pYou can work with that structure like thisp  precodeMyDictltstringgt.Value  MyDictltintgt.Value.ToString codepre  pThe problem is that this dictionary is global. The only way to create different dictionaries is to create different classes.p  pHow can create a similar fastest lookup, no boxing nonstatic structure Without code generation.p  pSimply said I want to have multiple codeDictionaryltType, objectgtcodelike objects without lookup costs, casting and boxing.p
Negative 28 pI am working on a single page app implemented as static html files making AJAX request to an Web Api web service. It is hosted on an IIS 7.5.p  pI have problems getting authentication on static html files to work, when users have authenticated themselves against and web api service sharing the same machine key as the web site.p  pI basically have a basic web site with static .html files and an asp.net application with the Web Api web service. Most of the static html files should only be available to authenticated users requests with a valid FormsAuthentication cookie issued by a apilogin route in the web api app, and these files are located in a secure folder below the website root. The Web Api ASP.NET application is located in an api folder below the website rootp  pWebsiteRoot   apibr   secure   login.html   1.html   2.htmlp  pThis works fine, and the static files like 1.html can make AJAX requests to the web api routes below the api route. Now I want to move 1.html and 2.html inside secure to restrict access to them to only authenticated users.p  pThe web api service itself uses FormsAuthentication to restrict access to the service routes.  Users authenticate by making AJAX requests to apilogin which is configured with [AllowAnnonymous], and now I want only users authenticated this way to be granted access to the static .html files inside the secure folder.p  pSo my idea is thisp  p1 Ensure that the ASP.NET pipeline handles requests to .html files.p  p2 Enable forms authentication in the static web sitep  p3 Deny anonymous access to the websiterootsecure folder.p  p4 Ensure that the Auth cookie issued when authenticating against apilogin is also valid for the authentication mechanism on the secure folder.p  pI have tried doing this, but currently I am denied access to files inside websiterootsecure even though the request is authenticated it has an .ASPFORMSAUTHI cookie issued by the apilogin route in the web api appp  pHere is what I have done I have 3 web.config files 1 in WebsiteRoot, 1 in WebsiteRootapi the root of the web api application and 1 in WebsiteRootsecurep  pTo ensure 4, I have configured FormsAuthentication identically and used the same machoine key in both the website root and the websiterootapi web.config files. The domin for the cookie is set to the same in both files.p  pThen, to ensure 1, I have added this to the website root web.config file, to ensure that .html files all files are handled and authenticated by the ASP.NET pipelinep  precodeltsystem.webServergt     ltmodules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststruegt           ltadd  nameFormsAuthenticationModule  typeSystem.Web.Security.FormsAuthenticationModule gt           ltremove  nameUrlAuthorization gt           ltadd  nameUrlAuthorization typeSystem.Web.Security.UrlAuthorizationModule  gt           ltremove  nameDefaultAuthentication gt           ltadd  nameDefaultAuthentication  typeSystem.Web.Security.DefaultAuthenticationModule gt     ltmodulesgt ltsystem.webServergt codepre  pHere is the relevant stuff from the web api application web.config file located in websiterootapi p  precodeltsystem.webgt ltauthentication modeFormsgt   ltforms name.ASPXFORMSAUTH protectionAll path domain.mydomain.com timeout7200 slidingExpirationtrue gt ltauthenticationgt ltmachineKey validationKeySAMEINBOTHFILES decryptionKeySAMEINBOTHFILES validationSHA1 decryptionAES gt ltroleManager enabledtrue defaultProvidersimplegt   ltprovidersgt     ltclear gt     ltadd namesimple typeWebMatrix.WebData.SimpleRoleProvider, WebMatrix.WebData gt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt ltmembership defaultProvidersimplegt   ltprovidersgt     ltclear gt     ltadd namesimple typeWebMatrix.WebData.SimpleMembershipProvider, WebMatrix.WebData gt   ltprovidersgt ltmembershipgt ... codepre  pp  pHere is the website root web.config file located in websiteroot p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltconfigurationgt     ltsystem.webgt         ltauthentication modeFormsgt           ltforms loginUrllogin.html name.ASPXFORMSAUTH protectionAll domain.mydomain.com path timeout7200 slidingExpirationtrue gt         ltauthenticationgt         ltmachineKey validationKeySAMEINBOTHFILES decryptionKeySAMEINBOTHFILES validationSHA1 decryptionAES gt     ltsystem.webgt             ltsystem.webServergt                 ltmodules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststruegt                       ltadd  nameFormsAuthenticationModule  typeSystem.Web.Security.FormsAuthenticationModule gt                       ltremove  nameUrlAuthorization gt                       ltadd  nameUrlAuthorization typeSystem.Web.Security.UrlAuthorizationModule  gt                       ltremove  nameDefaultAuthentication gt                       ltadd  nameDefaultAuthentication  typeSystem.Web.Security.DefaultAuthenticationModule gt                 ltmodulesgt             ltsystem.webServergt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pHere is the web.config file located in websiterootsecure p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltconfigurationgt     ltsystem.webgt         ltauthorizationgt             ltdeny users gt         ltauthorizationgt     ltsystem.webgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pNote, that if I change p  precodeltdeny users gt  codepre  pto p  precodeltallow users gt   codepre  pThen I am granted access to the .html files inside websiterootsecurep  pSo my question are p  p1 Why are requests to secure denied when the requests contains the .ASPFORMSAUTH cookies issued by apilogin p  p2 Are there alternative solutions as to how to make a static website where some files are restricted to users who have been authenticated against an web api service on the same sitep

Negative 28 pMy requirement is to launch a setup wizard on first launch and open a list view on consecutive launch. The setup wizard will collect information to create users and related settings. The list view is a more of a tabbed view with tab content scrollable.p  pThe setup wizard is of LinearLayout whereas the second launch should use TabHost. While I am using sharedPreferences to find out first launch etc, how to call different layouts. If I use setContentView based on the condition, the class has to extend TabActivity but it fails if setup wizard is launched as no TabHost is present. If I use intent to launch the different screens, should I have a dummy layout from which either setup or listing layouts are launched through intents When back button is clicked, it goes back to the dummy layout. Any suggestions on how it should be designedp

Negative 28 pIm working on a project that has an outer codeUserControlcode called strongOuterstrong that does some logic to determine which inner codeUserControlcode to load statically in its code.

Then when the codePageLoadcode of any of the inner controls runs, each of those can access codefoocode and it will not be codenullcode.p  pThis does not happen. Instead, in any codePageLoadcode of codeInner1code, codeInner2code, or codeInner3code  when I access codefoocode it is always codenullcode. However, when the page loads in the browser, the codePageLoadcode of codeOutercode fully executes, then the codePageLoadcode of codeInnerXcode loads, so Im perplexed as to why codefoocode is codenullcode again when I call the inner controls codePageLoadcode which I know runs after the outer control which sets codefoocode.p  pIf I were to remove the codeDoStuffcode call from the outer codePageLoadcode and move into into each individual inner codePageLoadcode, it works fine. I would like to avoid this though.p

For problem 67 it worked maverlously, but this time it stops working after the second iteration I have to perform the algorithm on multiple continued fractions.p  pThis is the piece of code I used an external module, namely sympyp  precodeimport time from sympy import  from sympy import fraction, Rational, Symbol  def contfracttofractioncontfraclist     acontfraclist[1]     bcontfraclist[2]     newreducedRationalb,1 Rational1,a     contfraclist[2]newreduced     del contfraclist[1]     if lencontfraclist1         print contfraclist To check         return contfraclist     else         contfracttofractioncontfraclist  def numeratorhigherdenominatorfraction     numstrfraction[0]     denstrfraction[1]     if lennumgtlenden         return 1     else         return 0  starttime.time  tally0  for k in xrange 1, 101     sqrteval[1]     for x in xrange 1, k2         sqrteval.append2     sqrtevalcontfracttofractionsqrteval     print sqrteval To double check     fractionresultfractionsoln[0] To introduce later     tallynumeratorhigherdenominatorfractionresult To introduce later  elapsedtime.timestart  print Solution , tally, Solved in , elapsed codepre  pI basically test just to see if it gets all the final fraction and the print from the function, before the return, gives the answer, but the print after I assigned the value to sqrteval prints None.

Negative 28 psub[An earlier version of this post had the inaccurate title How to add one column to an array of numpy records  The question asked emin that earlier titleem has already been partially a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1201817answereda, but this answer is not quite what the embodyem of that earlier version of this post was asking for.  Ive reworded the title, and edited the post substantially, to make the distinction clearer.  I also explain why I the answer mentioned earlier falls short of what Im looking for.]subp  hr  pSuppose I have two codenumpycode arrays codexcode and codeycode, each consisting of emrem record aka structured arrays.  Let the shape of codexcode be emrem, emcsubxsubem and the shape of codeycode be emrem, emcsubysubem.  Lets also assume that theres no overlap between codex.dtype.namescode and codey.dtype.namescode.p  pFor example, for emrem  2, emcsubxsubem  2, and emcsubysubem  1p  precodeimport numpy as np x  np.arrayzip1, 2, 3., 4., dtype[i, i4, f, f4] y  np.arrayzipa, b, dtype[s, a10] codepre  pI would like to horizontally concatenate codexcode and codeycode to produce a emnewem array of records codezcode, having shape emrem, emcsubxsubem  emcsubysubem.  This operation should not modify codexcode or codeycode at all.p  pIn general, codez  np.hstackx, ycode wont do, because the codedtypecodes in codexcode and codeycode wont necessarily match.  E.g., continuing the example abovep  precodez  np.hstackx, y  TypeError                                 Traceback most recent call last ltipythoninput7def477e6c8bfgt in ltmodulegt gt 1 z  np.hstackx, y TypeError invalid type promotion codepre  pbrp  pNow, there is a function, codenumpy.lib.recfunctions.appendfieldscode, that emlooksem like it may do something close to what Im looking for, but I have not been able to get anything out of it  everything I have tried with it either fails with an error, or produces something other than what Im trying to get.p  pCan someone please show me emexplicitlyem the code using coden.l.r.appendfieldscode or otherwisesup1sup that would generate, from the codexcode and codeycode defined in the example above, a emnewem array of records, codezcode, equivalent to the horizontal concatenation of codexcode and codeycode, and do so without modifying either codexcode or codeycodep  pI assume that this will require only one or two lines of code.  Of course, I am looking for code that does not require building codezcode, record by record, by iterating over codexcode and codeycode.  Also, the code may assume that codexcode and codeycode have the same number of records, and that there is no overlap between codex.dtype.namescode and codey.dtype.namescode.  Other than this, the code Im looking for should know nothing about codexcode and codeycode.  Ideally, it should be agnostic also about the number of arrays to join.  IOW, leaving out error checking, the code Im looking for could be the body of a function codehstackreccode so that the new array codezcode would be the result codehstackrecx, ycode.p  hr  psup1supsub...although I have to admit that, after my sofar perfect record of failure with codenumpy.lib.recfunctions.appendfieldscode, Ive become a bit curious about how this function could be used strongemat allemstrong, irrespective of its relevance to this posts question.subp

Negative 28 pI want to find a way to handle my windows and controls WINAPI easy and securely and I have two options in my headbr 1. Create classes with methods for the windowscontrols and variables holding information about them 2. Create vectors holding structs that contain all the information for the windowscontrolsp  pIn my specific case the vectors is a better choice because I can create a global vector with all the windowscontrols then be able to search through it and get any window control from any other function. In the case of the objects I will have to send them as arguments to some of the functions and sometimes Im not able to do even that like when I send a function as an argument to another function.p  pMy question is which of them will affect performance more By performance I mean memory and processor use.

Negative 28 pThere is a lot of example code about that uses an codeIntentFiltercode with a scheme of codehttpcode and the codemimeTypecode set. See the answers to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6890926handlingmimetypethatistheresultofabrowserpostinandroidHandling MIME type that is the result of a browser POST in Androida, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4589155intentfilterforbrowsingxmlspecificallyrssinandroidIntent filter for browsing XML specifically rss in androida, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4901662howtoopenmyandroidappwhenrsslinkisopenedinbrowserHow to open my Android app when rss link is opened in browserap  pThe specific use case I have is for RSS links, like those last two questions, but the RSS feeds I want to intercept do not have a path I can usefully match by codepathPatterncode, and I have no control over that. Ive tried using the same intent filter that was originally extracted from the Google Reader APKp  precode    ltintentfilter androidlabelstringNewURLintentrssgt         ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.VIEW gt         ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt         ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.BROWSABLE gt         ltdata androidschemehttpgt         ltdata androidhost gt         ltdata androidmimeTypetextxmlgt         ltdata androidmimeTypeapplicationrssxml gt         ltdata androidmimeTypeapplicationatomxmlgt         ltdata androidmimeTypeapplicationxmlgt     ltintentfiltergt codepre  pbut when I test this by clicking a link in Chrome that points to such a file, Chrome just browses to that file. I have Google Reader installed, and that doesnt respond to the intent either. If I replace the codemimeTypecode lines with a codepathPatterncode that matches the test URL, my app receives the intent. By making HEAD requests to the server, Ive verified that the ContentType of the URL is being sent as applicationxml. The test device is a Nexus 10 on the stock ROM.p  pI made another test by restoring the codemimeTypecode filters and launching the URL from codeam startcode in a shell. This command, specifying only the URL,p  precodeam start a android.intent.action.VIEW c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE d httpmy.testurl codepre  plaunched the browser, but when I specified the type explicitly in this command,p  precodeam start a android.intent.action.VIEW c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE t applicationxml d httpmy.testurl codepre  pit showed me an intent chooser for my app and Google Reader. This seems to confirm that the filter is taking effect, but Chrome is starting the intent without supplying a type, and the intent resolver isnt finding the type from the URL the way it does for codecontentcode URIs, but it seems implausible that so many people could be using and recommending intent filters that cant possibly work. Does anyone have a definitive answer whats the use of an intent filter with codeltdata androidschemehttp androidmimeType... gtcodep

Negative 28 pIm trying to create an Android app whose home screen has three buttons. Im using the program Eclipse and it automatically gives the buttons a horizontal linear layout.

Negative 28 pIve done a bit of customising to a woothemes.com theme superstore so that it now loads a popup div when a product is added to the cart, this enables a customer to either continue shopping or checkout at the click of a button  so pretty useful. This works fine on the single product page e.g  a hrefhttppbs.transparentwebdesigns.co.ukshophandsawsbahco244roughcutsaw227tpi relnofollowhttppbs.transparentwebdesigns.co.ukshophandsawsbahco244roughcutsaw227tpiap  pBUT....p  pIve also edited the category pages to include a gridlist view togglep  pa hrefhttppbs.transparentwebdesigns.co.ukproductcategoryhandtools relnofollowhttppbs.transparentwebdesigns.co.ukproductcategoryhandtoolsa p  pon the list view toggle an add to cart button is displayed. This works fine in that if you click the add to cart button the correct item is added to the cart, the issue is that the popup displays the name of the first product that was added. So the first time you add a product the popup displays the correct product name, but if you dont refresh the page and add a different product the popup still shows the first product name  I think this is because the popup div needs refreshing but Im not sure how to do this, can anyone helpp  pFeel free to use this code on your own projectp  pjquery neededp  precode    ajax quantity add     jQuerydocument.readyfunction      document.on change, .quantity .qty, function      this.parent.quantity.prevcartbtn.attrdataquantity, this.val                ajax add to cart and popup single product page     jQuerydocument.readyfunction           Ajax add to cart     document.on click, cartbtn, function                          popup                     popupcontent.popup                                          setcookie false,                      selfclose 0,                     centered true,                      floating false,                     popupdiv popup,                     overlay true,                     opacitylevel 0.6,                     popupappear  show,                     popupappeartime  0,                     popupdisappear  fadeOut,                     popupdisappeartime 200                                               AJAX add to cart request         var thisbutton  this          if thisbutton.is.addtocartbuttonpopup               if thisbutton.attrdataproductid return true              var data                   action         woocommerceaddtocart,                 productid     thisbutton.attrdataproductid,                 quantity       thisbutton.attrdataquantity,                 security       woocommerceparams.addtocartnonce                            Trigger event             body.trigger addingtocart, [ thisbutton, data ]                Ajax action             .post woocommerceparams.ajaxurl, data, function response                    if   response                      return                  var thispage  window.location.toString                  if  response.error ampamp response.producturl                       window.location  response.producturl                     return                                    Redirect to cart option                 if  woocommerceparams.cartredirectafteradd  yes                        window.location  woocommerceparams.carturl                     return                   else                       thisbutton.removeClassloading                      fragments  response.fragments                     carthash  response.carthash                       Block fragments class                     if  fragments                           .eachfragments, functionkey, value                              key.addClassupdating                                                                     Block widgets and fragments                     .shoptable.cart, .updating, .carttotals.fadeTo400, 0.6.blockmessage null, overlayCSS background transparent url  woocommerceparams.ajaxloaderurl   norepeat center, backgroundSize 16px 16px, opacity 0.6                          Replace fragments                     if  fragments                           .eachfragments, functionkey, value                              key.replaceWithvalue                                                                     Unblock                     .widgetshoppingcart, .updating.stoptrue.cssopacity, 1.unblock                       Cart page elements                     .shoptable.cart.load thispage   .shoptable.carteq0 gt , function                           div.quantitynot.buttonsadded, td.quantitynot.buttonsadded.addClassbuttonsadded.appendltinput typebutton value idadd1 classplus gt.prependltinput typebutton value idminus1 classminus gt                          .shoptable.cart.stoptrue.cssopacity, 1.unblock                          body.triggercartpagerefreshed                                             update the popup cart notice                     popupwoocommercecartnoticeminimumamount.htmlwoocommercecartnoticeminimumamount.html                      .carttotals.load thispage   .carttotalseq0 gt , function                          .carttotals.stoptrue.cssopacity, 1.unblock                                            Trigger event so themes can refresh other areas                     body.trigger addedtocart, [ fragments, carthash ]                                              return false           else              return true                   codepre  pthen in themefolderwoocommercesingleproductaddtocartp  precode    ltphp           Custom Loop Add to Cart.

If I add 2 packfiles, one for each name of an image in my tile set, I find the Atlas isnt constructed correctly in memory.  What am I missing here  Should there only ever be one tile in a tilemapp  pCode from Libgdxp  precode    for TileSet set  map.tileSets          FileHandle packfile  getRelativeFileHandleinputDir, removeExtensionset.imageName   packfile         TextureAtlas textureAtlas  new TextureAtlaspackfile, packfile.parent, false         ArrayltAtlasRegiongt atlasRegions  textureAtlas.findRegionsremoveExtensionremovePathset.imageName         for AtlasRegion reg  atlasRegions              regionsMap.putreg.index  set.firstgid, reg             if textures.containsreg.getTexture                  textures.addreg.getTexture                            codepre

Negative 28 pI have a simple mongo application that happens to be async using Akka. I send a message to an actor, which in turn write 3 records to a database.

Negative 28 pstrongEDIT based on the very helpful comment below, after further review, Id just like to add for other rookies like myself that when using UIManagedDocument to obtain your core data functionality, pay attention to WHEN your instance is being opened in your app. The error I was getting was because my managed object context WAS nil when my fetched results controller was being set up. I moved the method call which set up the fetched results controller to after the UIManagedDocument instance was opened.  It might be very basic, and just a commonsense issue to most, but for us rookies, when core data is not being set up in the app delegate, we need to learn that the document has to be in a usable state before we can set the fetchedResultsController.strongp  pIm working through Paul Hegartys Stanford lectures on Core Data, specifically the demo lecture for the Photomania app.p  pInstead of using NSDictionaries of photos, I modified the app to include only Model objects that store NSStrings for example, a persons name, etc. Its just a learning exercise for me.p  pI believe Ive successfully recreated a UIManagedDocument using his code, and set the view controllers managed object property to that of the documents managed object context through the two methods below theyre his methods, not mine, of course.p  pI put this code in a tableview controller that will appear on screen so I could test in viewDidLoad if the managed object context exists its a subclass of his CoreDataTableViewController class. Is that even a valid test for a managed object contextp  pI understand the code that creates or opens the UIManagedDocument, but I dont understand why that managed object context is nil if i modify the little test in viewDidLoad, it will tell me that the context is  nil .p  pAt this point, nothing has been written to the context, I havent included any fetched results either. p  pIm breaking it down into sections because my simplified version of the lecture app kept giving me the error that the managed object context and fetched results controller were nil.p  pI want to test, in this case, if Im getting a valid managed object context before moving forward. I have a strong feeling theres some fundamental piece of info Im missing in whats essentially copied code for learning purposes.p  pDoes anyone know why the managed object context is nil Or SHOULD it be that way at this point because Ive missed something when setting it Or when I set the UIManagedDocuments context as the table view controllers  self contextp  pAny information would be greatly appreciated.p  precodevoidsetManagedObjectContextNSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext      managedObjectContext  managedObjectContext   voidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewWillAppearanimated]     if self.managedObjectContext [self useDemoDocument]    voiduseDemoDocument      NSURL url  [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectoryNSDocumentDirectory        inDomainsNSUserDomainMask] lastObject]     url  [url URLByAppendingPathComponentDemo Document]      UIManagedDocument document  [[UIManagedDocument alloc] initWithFileURLurl]      if [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath[url path]]           create it         [ document saveToURLurl              forSaveOperationUIDocumentSaveForCreating            completionHandlerBOOL success                 if success                     self.managedObjectContext  document.managedObjectContext                             ]      else if document.documentState  UIDocumentStateClosed         open it         [document openWithCompletionHandlerBOOL success              if success                  self.managedObjectContext  document.managedObjectContext                      ]      else          try to use it         self.managedObjectContext  document.managedObjectContext        voidviewDidLoad      if self.managedObjectContext          NSLogthere is a managed object context        codepre

This also leads to escalation of locks and after 510 minutes the entire database gets locked, preventing any other operation leading to sort of a deadlock.br Note that a actual deadlock does not take place, the operation simply does not proceed. brSolutions tried  Creating non clustered index on the table to help SQL server identify and lock specific rows.br Please suggest some solution or possible causes for the issue.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter some investigation and analysis, I have figured out a solution. I have moved the steps 3,6,7 at the end of the thread after all the data has been generated. So these steps are now being done in a separate method and Transaction notation is only applied to the method rather than doing the whole thread operation in a Transaction. Further this method has been made a synchronised method , due to which even though there are 10 threads active, only one 1 thread will write to DB at any point of time.So this eliminates the worries of multiple threads trying to write to DB at the same time. br I have tested this approach and none of the issues seen earlier are present now, but just wanted to know whether annotating a method with both strongTransactionalstrong and making it strongsynchronizedstrong is fine, as in will it have undesirable effects. Further is it a good practice to write to DB in a synchronised method.brbr For those interested in what was actual cause of the earlier problem, I have mentioned a probable reason which may or may not be correct. One possible reason for the threads getting stuck was that the thread pool executor had a max size of 10 threads while the Apache DBCP pool had a max size of 8 DB connections. So when one first thread got into a transaction and remained idle for than 5 min minEvicatableTime, it was evicted and its connection was given to another thread. Now the other threads who had got the connection couldnt write data as the tables were locked by the first thread, while first thread couldnt complete as it did not have a DB connection.p

Negative 28 pPlease be advised, I am a beginning programmer and a beginning pythonpandas user. Im a behavioral scientist and learning to use pandas to process and organize my data. As a result, some of this might seem completely obvious and it may seem like a question not worthy of the forum. Please have tolerance To me, this is days of work, and I have indeed spent hours trying to figure out the answer to this question already. Thanks in advance for any help.p  pMy data look like this. The real Actor and Recipient data are always 5digit numbers, and the Behavior data are always letter codes. My problem is that I also use this format for special lines, denoted by markers like date or s in the Actor column. These markers indicate that the Behavior column holds this special type of data, and not actual Behavior data. So, I want to replace the markers in the Actor column with NaN values, and grab the special data from the behavior column to put in another column in this example, the empty Activity column.p  precode    follow    Activity    Actor    Behavior    Recipient1 0   1         NaN         date     2.1.3.2012  NaN 1   1         NaN         s        ss.hx       NaN 2   1         NaN         50505    vo          51608 3   1         NaN         51608    vr          50505 4   1         NaN         s        ss.he       NaN codepre  pSo far, I have written some code in pandas to select out the s lines into a new dataframe p  precodedef getactlinegroup     return group.ix[group.Actor  s]  result  trimdata.groupbyfollow.applygetactline codepre  pIve copied over the Behavior column in this dataframe to the Activity column, and replaced the Actor and Behavior values with NaNp  precoderesult.Activity  result.Behavior result.Behavior  np.nan result.Actor  np.nan result.head codepre  pSo my new dataframe looks like this p  precodefollow         follow    Activity    Actor    Behavior    Recipient1 1        2     1         ss.hx       NaN      NaN         NaN          34    1         hf.xa       NaN      NaN         f.53702          74    1         hf.fe       NaN      NaN         NaN 10       1287  10        ss.hf       NaN      NaN         db          1335  10        fe          NaN      NaN         db codepre  pWhat I would like to do now is to combine this dataframe with the original, replacing all of the values in these selected rows, but maintaining values for the other rows in the original dataframe. p  pThis may seem like a simple question with an obvious solution, or perhaps I have gone about it all wrong to begin with p  pIve worked through Wes McKinneys book, Ive read the documentation on different types of merges, mapping, joining, transformations, concatenations, etc. I have browsed the forums and have not found an answer that helps me to figure this out.

When I tried to implement that, I first found that there was an IV.

I assume my problem might has something to do with the IV but I have no idea. Plus, the first implementation I found used a salt to generate another key and also a random IV but the problem is that the client has no idea of which saltIV is the Server using. I guess you could send that via public key crypto but I first want a simple working AES crypto.p  pThanks.p

Negative 28 pI was just very confused by some code that I wrote.

The first one produces a list of whatever type codefcode returns, the second produces a list of codeconcurrent.futures.Futurecode objects that then need to be evaluated with their coderesultcode method in order to get the value that codefcode returned. p  pMy main concern is that this means that codeexecutor.mapcode cant take advantage of codeconcurrent.futures.ascompletedcode, which seems like an extremely convenient way to evaluate the results of some longrunning calls to a database that Im making as they become available. p  pIm not at all clear on how codeconcurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutorcode objects work  naively, I would prefer the somewhat more verbosep  precodewith concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutormaxworkers4 as executor     resultfutures  listmaplambda x executor.submitf, x, iterable     results  [f.result for f in futures.ascompletedresultfutures] codepre  pover the more concise codeexecutor.mapcode in order to take advantage of a possible gain in performance.

Negative 28 pThere is a program written in C with some CUDA kernels and I need to adapt this program to run in python using PyCUDA. Now, in this C code there are some global variables defined and some of those kernels are accessing those variables via ifdef. What I would like to do is to define those global variables in python and then just copy my CUDA C kernels code and run them using SourceModule scheme lets say Im just lazy. I imagine something like thisp  precodemyglobalvarTrue modSourceModule global void func  ... ifdef myglobalvar do something endif   codepre  pIs there any way to do that Clearly, that naive attempt doesnt work at all. Should I use some kind of special pointer or something like that  In other words, what exacly happens when CUDA C kernel compiled with PyCUDA have ifdef in itp  pstrongEditstrong  Well, it is possible that Im misusing the global variable term here. The C code looks more or less like thisp  precodedefine X global void func...  ... ifdef X do something endif  codepre  pWhat Im trying to achieve is to use that C code in PyCUDA without messing with it too much. So I would like to just copy strongglobalstrong void func..., put it in PyCUDA SourceModule and define that X no matters if it is global variable or something different in python like in the first pseudocode. Is it possiblep

It was already configured on one or more child injectors or private modules bound at ServiceOneGuiceModule.provideJPQLQuery bound at ServiceTwoGuiceModule.provideJPQLQuery codepre  pNow, I understand why this is broken  Im saying that theres two Providers for the type JPQLQuery and Guice doesnt know which one to use.p  pIs there any way I can get Guice to separate these Providers  I would like to do this because each module has its own properlyconfigured Hibernate entities, and each has its own unique datasource multiple databases in this project.p  pIdeally, it would involve something like somehow naming these providers and injecting them by their name e.g. I could separately inject ServiceOneJPQLQueryProvider and ServiceTwoJPQLQueryProvider, but I havent found any way of achieving anything like this.p  pI suppose an alternative is to somehow configure Hibernate so it has all the different datasources it needs and then Id only need one Provider for my queries, possibly, but that seems like a lot more work than what Im describing abovep
Negative 28 pIs there a way to add a default image file to a content type field, using features, a module or anything.

Negative 28 pI just stumbled across the fact that the codePasswordcode property of WPF codePasswordBoxcodees is not bindable for emsecurity reasonsem, which makes using them quite cumbersome in a MVVM context.  Answers like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14933303198247httpstackoverflow.coma14933303198247a suggest that otherwise, the password might be stored in plain text in memory at runtime, which would be a bad idea since it could potentially be read by malware.p  pHowever, I still dont seem to understand the reason in general or that answer. There, it says emKeeping your password in plain text on the client machine RAM is a security nono.em. However, the password is in memory as soon as it is typed as Im able to access it from code.  So why would malware not be able to read it directly from the textbox Am I missing another point here p  pedit To clarify, esp. w regards to Sheridans answer Assume a codePasswordBoxcode where a user types pw as his password. Then, clearly pw is in memory as I can retrieve it via codePasswordBox.Passwordcode. emWhy is it then insecure to additionally be able to bind it to a string property of a ViewModelem Then, pw would at most be contained in two strings, but as far as I can see, this should not make it any more or less secure.  Or is the point really to remind the programmer that the PW should not be stored for longer than neededp
Negative 28 pI am currently working on a django application and I am trying to develop a little recommendation system for it.

I am using postgresql as my database management system, any ideas or help would be much appreciated. I would think I would need to find out where the profile data is stored in the database and make manual sql queries. However, I am still relatively new to django and this is my first time using postgre for dbms instead of mysql.p

Negative 28 pI tried googling and searching for this question but somehow couldnt find anything relevant about it.

E.g. the following, either usep  precodepublic class calculation   XYZ bla   public calculationXYZ something        this.bla  something      public void calc1         some calculations with this.bla      public void calc1         some more calculations with this.bla      public XYZ getBla        return this.bla     codepre  por maybe dop  precodepublic class calculation   public calculation    public static XYZ calc1XYZ bla  maybe static, if not dependant on other attributesinstancevariables etc         some calculations with bla     return bla      public static XYZ calc1  maybe static, if not dependant on other attributesinstancevariables etc         some more calculations with bla     return bla     codepre  pI mean you can argue for both cases. I see advantages and maybe disadvantages for both different styles, but somehow I prefer the second one as far as long as there are not too many argumentsparameters needed. Sure, if I need many many more attributes etc., then the first one will be better, simpler etc. because I dont need to pass so many parameters to the method...p  pJust a question of personal style Or how to decide for one approach Thanksp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong A better example Im curently doing much image processing and the question would be wether to store the image internally in the state of the object or not.

Mat edges  ImageProcessing.cannyEdgesI, 20, 100 Mat lines  ImageProcessing.getHoughLinesI   draw lines... codepre  pquestion is Does codeIcode belong to the state of the object Would it make sense to convert to nonstatic and then use for examplep  precode here read image to I... ImageProcessing IP  new ImageProcessingI IP.cannyEdges20, 100  CHANGE OF cannyEdges Also save edges internally as property IP.calcHoughLines  also save the lines internally maybe Mat lines  IP.getLines    draw lines... codepre  pis this nicer The question arising is then again Should I for example store the result of codegetHoughLinescode i.e. the codelinescode internally or should I directly return it to the caller p

Negative 28 pI am using Alloy UI and YUI3 and have a form which, depending on the the users option choice from a select dropdown, fires an ajax call to the server. The server returns new validation rules which I send to the AUIFormValidation module. The rules are changing fine but the form is outputting duplicate rules.

Negative 28 pI have a userform with several dropdown lists, which are populated via a VBA macro. This happens right at the beginning, on opening the workbook. p  pOnce the load is done, the workbook becomes very slow.

Negative 28 pIm trying to graph the x,y,z values from an accelerometer reading on a phone using the d3 line graph code below.  The first measurement works great for graphing.  Subsequent measurements though produce an odd graph where each value is a flat line amp then compressed like its at a very high frequency at the end.  However if I reset the app amp run it again the graph is fine.  When I export the data and look at in a spreadsheet it appears to be giving valid ie. changing x,y,zamp time values.  Ive thought it might be a speed issue amp have reduced the measurement time to even 1000ms, but the problem continues.  It seems a variable is not being reset after it creates the first graph.p  pIm storing the accelerometer data in json format in local storage with the measurement time as the key.  To get a graph I use the key which is stored in a div id to get the correct json file from local storage amp then convert it to an array for the d3 setup to read.p  pAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp  precodefunction graph       var key  graphinfo.text      var dataObject  window.localStorage.getItemkey      var data  JSON.parsedataObject       data  .mapdata, functionvalue, index      return [value]        set up a colour variable     var color  d3.scale.category10       map one colour each to x, y and z      keys grabs the key value or heading of each key value pair in the json      but not time     console.logd3.keysdata[0]     color.domaind3.keysdata[0].filterfunctionkey          return key  timestamp            create a nested series for passing to the line generator      its best understood by console logging the data     var series  color.domain.mapfunctionname          return              name name,             values data.mapfunctiond                  return                      timestamp d.timestamp,                     score d[name]                                                   Set the dimensions of the canvas  graph     var margin           top 40,         right 20,         bottom 35,         left 30     ,         width  260  margin.left  margin.right,         height  220  margin.top  margin.bottom          height  120  margin.top  margin.bottom        Set the ranges     var x  d3.time.scale.range[0, width]     var y  d3.scale.linear.range[height, 0]       Define the axes     var xAxis  d3.svg.axis.scalex         .orientbottom.ticks5      var yAxis  d3.svg.axis.scaley         .orientleft.ticks5       Define the line      Note you plot the time  score pair from each key you created ealier      var valueline  d3.svg.line         .xfunctiond              return xd.timestamp                  .yfunctiond              return yd.score                 Adds the svg canvas     var svg  d3.selectgraph         .appendsvg         .attrwidth, width  margin.left  margin.right         .attrheight, height  margin.top  margin.bottom         .appendg         .attrtransform, translate  margin.left  ,  margin.top         Scale the range of the data     x.domaind3.extentdata, functiond          return d.timestamp            note the nested nature of this you need to dig an additional level     y.domain[         d3.minseries, functionc              return d3.minc.values, functionv                  return v.score                      ,         d3.maxseries, functionc              return d3.maxc.values, functionv                  return v.score                           ]       create a variable called series and bind the date      for each series append a g element and class it as series for css styling     var series  svg.selectAll.series         .dataseries         .enter.appendg         .attrclass, series       create the path for each series in the variable series i.e. x, y and z      pass each object called x, y nad z to the lne generator     series.appendpath         .attrclass, line         .attrd, functiond              console.logd  to see how d3 iterates through series             return valuelined.values                  .stylestroke, functiond              return colord.name                Add the X Axis     svg.appendg  Add the X Axis     .attrclass, x axis         .attrtransform, translate0,  height           .callxAxis       Add the Y Axis     svg.appendg  Add the Y Axis     .attrclass, y axis         .callyAxis      top title message     svg.appendtext         .attrx, width  2                      .attry, 0  margin.top  2         .attrtextanchor, middle           .stylefontsize, 16px           .textkey      Lower XAxis title     svg.appendtext       text label for the x axis         .attrx, width  2          .attry,  height  margin.bottom         .styletextanchor, middle         .textSeconds from measurement      svg       key       dataObject       data  []    function showCurrentGraph      graph             End graphing code codepre

Negative 28 pIm trying to wrap my head around how a hrefhttpsgithub.comatomelectronElectrona formerly Atom Shell works.p  pIm coming from a traditional, MVCstyle web application where a Browser is calling a emController Actionem through a emRouting Systemem, the Controller then fetches data from a store File System, Data Base, ... and renders a emViewem, which is sent back to the Browser. Some Actions may be sending back JSON instead, as they are called through JavaScriptAJAX instead of the Browser actually navigating to them.p  pI want to create that, but as a CrossPlatform Desktop Application. I know that Atom Shell combines both a ChromiumBrowser and a Node.jsv8 runtime, but Im not sure how they would communicate.p  pI guess I could run a full on web server basically, some Node.js HTTP Middleware like a hrefhttpexpressjs.comExpressa, but that creates a networkreachable server which might also trip up firewalls  one of the reasons I want to make a desktop app is precisely to avoid running a real server. Basically like the MVPMVVM pattern in a normal desktop app.p  pCan someone give me a few starting points for what Im trying to do How would the browser talk to the node runtime the Client as they call it to tell it Hey, fetch my the record with ID 12345 and would the Client return rendered HTML, or would the browser just get a blob of JSON back and render it through a JavaScript templating enginep

Negative 28 pThis is more of a am I doing it right question.     p  pQuick back story   I have built a gradle plugin in a standalone gradlegroovy project.   I am using it in a different java project.    The client project was referring to it via something like p  precodebuildScript        flatDir              dirs ..mygradlepluginbuildlibs               classpath name gradlemyplugin  codepre  pSo I didnt want the relative reference to the plugin project nor make plugin part of the client.   I thought Id see if I can put it up in a BinTray and refer to like a real plugin. p  pSo set up BinTray and after much trial and error, I got it to work, but I dont think I did correct.   Here is what I did p  ol liMade a maven repo   MyStuffli liMade a package      gradlemypluginli liMade a version      0.1li liuploaded a file for that version, but specified a target path like orgfhwgradlemyplugin0.1li ol  pMy buildScript block looks like this p  precodebuildScript      repositories          maven              url httpdl.bintray.commybintrayidMyStuff                       dependencies          classpath org.fhwgradlemyplugin0.1      codepre  pSo what I am curious about is the hack I did with the target on BinTray.  WO this, the proper path wasnt in place for uploaded filesjars for a version.  p  pSo is this a correct, process for BinTray and Gradle dependencies  p
Negative 28 pI am developing a rails application for a client. In a nutshell, it is for monitoring the progression of PhD uni students. One of the main functional requirements was for the user to be able to fill out reports online. The issue I am having is with one of the forms.p  pI am allowing the number of questions per form to be completely unrestricted, so I am using dynamic symbols to store the answers to the questions, and pass those answers to the controller in a hash.

This error is being caused because the hash is not being submitted from the form on the error screen  where it shows the params passed to the controller, the hash is not present.p  pAlso, I am unsure how to permit this hash through the white list of the object, so if someone could help with that it would also be helpful for now I am just permitting everything, so that wont be the issue. The field just isnt being submitted for some reason.p  pIf you need more information let me know Cheersp

Negative 28 pI am trying to get a firm understanding of DDD and having read Eric Evans book on Domain Driven Design and blogs from Julie Lerman they describep  pcodeAnemic Domain Modelcode as a model with classes focused on state management. Good for CRUD.p  pcodeEntitycode as a mutable class with an identity used for tracking and persistence.p  pSurely both are used for the same purpose or I have completely got the wrong end of the stick  What is the difference between the two I have read that an anemic domain model is often used to represent a database schema, but isnt the same for an entity toop  pFor example, a codetablecode called Customer which hasp  precodeCustomerId int Forename varchar50 Surname varchar50 IsActive bit codepre  pFrom my understanding an codeanemic domain modelcode to represent this would look likep  precodepublic class Customer    public int CustomerId  get set    public string Forename  get set    public string Surname  get set   codepre  pPast experiences for me suggest that an entity would also be represented in this fashion with a series of codegettercode and codesettercode properties, a la Entity Framework Both concepts entity and an anemic domain model are codemutablecodep  pThanks, DS.p

Negative 28 pIm learning RoR, and Im getting very confused by the path method as its used in Controllers and Routes. To be more specific, Im referring to the many different calls that take the syntax somethingpath. So far as I know, they all seem to either encode or manipulate a URL or link.

Ideally this would be one vector for each type created in the factory.p  pThis would be really easy if I could keep base class pointers in the vector, but alas my use case would vastly prefer all the instances be stored contiguously instead of wherever new puts them to get as many cache hits as possible.p  pI was thinking about doing something like this for the factory mapp  precodeMapltstring,pairltconstructorFnPtr, vectorltbaseClassgtgt codepre  pThis has the issue of losing the data from the derived class as it is cast to the base class.p  pI was also thinking that a pointer to a vector as the second member of the pair would be a good way to do it, but Im not sure how that could be implemented while still having a different data type stored in each vector.

Negative 28 pI have a Repository and Unit Of Work pattern implemented on top of Entity Framework. Today I wanted to add concurrency handling. I followed the standard steps of adding a RowVersion property and the appropriate configurations. Everything works well with the DBContext. I was assuming that my repository pattern wouldnt cause any problem with the standard Concurrency setup but I was wrong. This is my Update method of my generic BaseRepository used for most entities.p  precodepublic TViewModel UpdateltTViewModelgtTViewModel vm, object key where TViewModel  IUpdatableViewModelltTEntitygt      var entity  Findkey  OriginalValues is set to current DB value. This is bad.     vm.UpdateModelref entity  Every ViewModel implements UpdateModel which holds the logic of how to patch the entity it refers to     unitOfWork.Commit  Tells the UnitOfWork that owns this Repository to save the context     return FindltTViewModelgtkey  Get a new ViewModel of this entity  codepre  pAs the comments says, the OriginalValues is set with the current database values. When I update the entity, it will not compare the RowVersion from my ViewModel.p  pI implemented an ugly hack to make it work.p  precodepublic TViewModel UpdateltTViewModelgtTViewModel vm, object key where TViewModel  IUpdatableViewModelltTEntitygt      dbContext.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled  false  We want an entity that isnt attached to the context and doesnt keep original values     var entity  dbSet.AsExpandable.AsNoTracking.SingleOrDefaulto gt exprId.Invokeo  key     dbContext.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled  true     vm.UpdateModelref entity     entity  dbSet.Attachentity  Now that we have the RowVersion we want, we can attach it     dbContext.Entryentity.State  EntityState.Modified  And notify the changes     UpdateSubref entity     unitOfWork.Commit     return FindltTViewModelgtkey  codepre  pThis hack only works if the RowVersion is the only concurrency token. If I want to use column values as concurrency tokens instead of RowVersion, Im out of luck.p  pAnother hack I saw was to edit the RowVersion property in the OriginalValues object. Thats even worst because I wont be able to have a generic repository.p  pIs there a less smelly solution p

Negative 28 pIve looked online for hours trying to see if I could find a solution and while I have found many solutions my instructions from my professor are as followsp  blockquote   pWrite a program to estimate PI  using the following series.  This problem is also described in the text as problem 5.25 at the end of chapter 5.  If you are unfamiliar with series, problem 5.24 is a single pass through a series and the solution is posted in the Homework 3 course module.br   41131517191111i12i1   Obviously, there is no user input for this problem so a modified worksheet is provided.  You will to write a program that computes PI using i values of 10,000 to 100,000 in increments of 10000.  Your output should look like Hint  Placing t in the System.out.println  between the values of i and PI will give you columns.  This is the tab character.p blockquote  piPIp  p100003.xxxxxp  p200003.xxxxp  p300003.xxxxp  blockquote   pYou will need multiple loops to do this.  The outer loop will increment i.  The inner loop will compute the series from 1 to i.  You may use any of the three types of loops, for, while, or dowhile to do this.p blockquote  pNow I am well aware that there are many ways that are better at finding pi besides this, however the point of this assignment is not to find Pi efficiently but rather to practice with loops. However Ive tried numerous approaches and all of them return either infinite loops, incorrect outputs, or they just dont compile.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks to Martijn Courteaux Ive made a vast improvement in the code. however I still cant seem to get the count to increment properly.

Negative 28 pThere is a extremely similar question asked by the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13551042differentdataforsharingprovidersinuiactivityviewcontrollerDifferent data for sharing providers in UIActivityViewControllera.

For example, what if I would like to sharep  ul lia string on Twitterli lia array of an string and and image on Facebookli lithe actual data of the image e.g. NSData with Airdrop.li ul  pP.S.p  pI also looked at the following protocol functionp  precode idactivityViewControllerPlaceholderItem codepre  pHowever, I cannot use it because we dont know the value of codeactivityTypecode here. p

Firefox sends a full HTTP request while Chrome and IE send a very short garbled string IE even manages to send my PC user name this wayp  pIs there perhaps a small handshake that IE and Chrome require with the TCP connection before actually sending the http requests What am I missing Also I tried reading both ASCII and UTF8 encodings and nothing seems to help.p  pBelow is a PoC piece of code I use the code fails reading the first HTTP request line for Chrome nad IE and reads the full request in Firefoxp  precodeclass Proxy      private TcpListener tcpListener      private bool IsRunning  false      public void Attach              tcpListener  new TcpListenernew IPEndPointIPAddress.Parse127.0.0.1, 8888         tcpListener.Start200         IsRunning  true          var listeningTask  new Task gt ListeningThread         listeningTask.Start           public void ListeningThread              while IsRunning                      var client  tcpListener.AcceptTcpClient             var clientTask  new Task gt ProcessClientclient             clientTask.Start                    private void ProcessClientobject obj              var tcpClientConnection  TcpClientobj          while tcpClientConnection.Connected                      var headers  ReadHeaderstcpClientConnection.GetStream              foreachvar key in headers.Keys                              Console.WriteLine0 1, key, headers[key]                            DO Something after this                    public static Dictionaryltstring, stringgt ReadHeadersStream stream              var headers  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt         var binaryReader  new BinaryReaderstream          var headerline  ReadLinebinaryReader         while string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceheaderline                      var headerParts  headerline.Split              headers[headerParts[0]]  headerline.SubstringheaderParts[0].Length  1             headerline  ReadLinebinaryReader                  return headers           public static string ReadLineBinaryReader reader              var memoryStream  new MemoryStream         var decoder  Encoding.UTF8.GetDecoder          byte lastChar  0x00         while true                      byte newChar  0x00             try                              newChar  reader.ReadByte                 memoryStream.WriteBytenewChar                  if lastChar  0x0D ampamp newChar  0x0A                                      var lineString  Encoding.UTF8.GetStringmemoryStream.ToArray                     return lineString.Substring0, lineString.Length  2                                           catch EndOfStreamException                              throw new EndOfStreamExceptionReached EndOfStream but the line never ended no rn at the end                           lastChar  newChar                codepre

In a software that has millions even billions you need to make a report, but it is impossible to do so without seeking all the data and work with them in PHP, for example. p  pproblems p  p1  Naturally these records will take a lot to get to PHP since the data size is counted in GB.  2  Put all that data into a PHP array to treat them will cause the memory is not enough.p  pDoes anyone of you have gone through this dilemma For in tables with thousands of datam already experiencing slowness, and the problem is not the query as it was atimizada for me which I admit is not a great connoisseur of the database and most experts, the problem really is in PHP .

However, this actually fails for me codeorg.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException No qualifying bean of type [org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy] foundcode.p  pI have two questionsp  ol liWhy does the injected WebApplicationContext not automatically use the SpringSecurity filters Even if I could get the FilterChainProxy and add it manually, the JavaDoc for EmbeddedWebApplicationContext states li ol  blockquote   pany link Servlet or link Filter beans defined in the context will be automatically registered with the embedded Servlet containerp blockquote  pAs a result I wouldnt expect to have to manually add the security filter chain since I incorrectly expect this to just work due to the Auto Configuration magic in Spring Bootp  ol start2 liWhy is there no FilterChainProxy in the application context Again, perhaps my expectations of the AutoConfiguration is incorrect  but I thought that this would be configured as part of the context configuration.li ol  pThanks in advance for any advice.p  hr  h3Editsh3  ul lipThe reason a FilterChainProxy doesnt get injected was because I has my configuration set top  ppublic void configureWebSecurity web      web.debugtrue pli ul  pThis actually configures a codeorg.springframework.security.web.debug.DebugFiltercode instead. The way I have now managed to get the Filter regardless of this debug setting is as followsp  precodeResourcename  AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer.DEFAULTFILTERNAME private Filter securityFilter codepre  pIf I add this to the MockMvcBuilder as followsp  precodeMockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetupwebApplicationContext.addFilterssecurityFilter codepre  pthen it does work as expected.p  pBut, I dont understand why MockMVC would ignore the filters as this seems important for testing a request since anything could happen in a Filter that might impact the outcome of the test. Furthermore, it means that to test properly Id need to lookup all Filters in the servlet context and establish their priorityurl mapping and add them appropriately. This seems error prone and unnecessary.p
Negative 28 pI have a function that looks like thisp  precodedef insertmultiplecakescakelist   ensureindexes    insertlist  cakelist.map  cake mongofyvaluescake.tohash     inserted  db[CAKECOLLECTION].insertinsertlist, w 0    return inserted.length end codepre  pThe goal of the function is to insert all cakes from codecakelistcode into the Mongo database. Any cake that already exists in the database should be ignored. The function should return the number of cakes inserted, so if codecakelistcode contains 5 cakes and 2 of those cakes already exist in the database, the function should return 3.p  pMy problem is that after an hour of experimenting, I have concluded the followingp  ul lipIf the write concern the codewcode option is 0, then the insert call silently ignores all duplicate inserts, and the return value contains emallem the input documents, even those that werent inserted. It doesnt matter what I set codecontinueonerrorcode or codecollectonerrorcode, the return value emalwaysem contains all the documents, and the list of collected errors is always empty.pli lipIf the write concern is 1, then the insert call fails with an codeMongoOperationFailurecode if there are any duplicates among the input documents. It doesnt matter what I set codecontinueonerrorcode or codecollectonerrorcode to, the insert always fails when there are duplicates.pli ul  pSo it seems to me that the only way to achieve this is to iterate over the input list, perform a search for EVERY document and filter away those that already exist.

Negative 28 pI have a kind of theoretical question, that a friend and I have been trying to see, how we could do it.

We have had several ideas of how to do this, but none of them matches with the type of function we madep  precodepalindrome  String gt Bool codepre  pOne of the closest approaches was using composition, but it returns us a Function, that takes two Strings and not one, since one is for reverse and other for the p  precodepalindrome   . reverse codepre  pMaybe, were forgetting something or were not seeing something. How would you do it in order to use this two functions without using Lambda p

Negative 28 pI have been developing a set of internal apps and just got around to Lollipop testing they were supposed to be retired long before the rollout. Parts of my apps involve correlating timing of events relative to sensor data. In the past, our usage devices have had the SensorEvent.timestamp value expressed relative to either elapsedRealtime or currentTimeMillis, but neither seem to work on a Nexus 5 with the Lollipop factory image. Does anyone know what the new timestamp is relative top

All subsequent modifications to source files are made inside of the workspace and NOT in the original project directory.p  pWhen I use the import Gradle Project wizard the imported project is not copied in the workspace directory. All modifications I make are outside of the workspace directory in the original gradle project.p  pI want to achieve the same results as in a normal java project. Can I copy the whole Gradle project directory into the workspace directory and import it from there  Will something bad happen if I do this I want this because usually I organize my work by workspaces and this gradle project outside of workspace is really bothering me.p
Negative 28 pAfter creating a repository containing some binary files yes codegitcode indeed doesnt handle binary files that well, but this is a repository where the binaries are mandatory files, performing a commit becomes kind of bloated.p  pWhen one performs a codecommitcode the memory usage of codegitcode reaches code2.7 GiBcode. Sometimes the process is even killed by the operating system because it uses all remaining system resources.p  pThis is probably due to the internally used codediffcode algorithm that requires to take both the original and the new file into account and needs to take at least one of the files into memory the second can be handled as a emstreamem.p  pIs it possible to emmarkem a file as embinaryem and specify that the repository doesnt need to calculate the difference, but only check for a new version this can be done by handling both files as streams, thus in constant memory. After all, the storing the difference is probably as inefficient as copying the new version.p  pcodegitcode repositories are maintained on the machine automatically. It would thus be nice, if the process could be automated and thus use for instance the MIMEtype of the files and mark all binary files automatically.p

However, it causes trouble when using some printing methods, such as the Unix emlpem command, which strongfails to hide the textstrong as well as strongautofitting the pagestrong to start at this higher position, skewing the resulting printout in a problematic way.  The fields are also viewable in Adobe Pro if one uses an exploit with the zoom feature normally, one cannot look outside of the page boundary, but the items can be seem if one zooms out farenough they can subsequently be dragged somewhere useful for viewing and manipulating.p  pMy intent is to use iText to fill out the AcroForms contained in the file with data, then have my Java program make a call to the emlpem command to silently print the file, and finally delete the modified file.  This all works well except that this printing method does not behave well with this hidden field.p  pMy first idea was to find a way to see if there were any extra strongparameters to the emlpem commandstrong that would prevent this behavior.

Negative 28 pThis is my first question in StackOverflow. Due to lack of reputations, I couldnt post any links or images. Ive been working on the following issue for more than 2 days. Any help would greatly be appreciated.p  pBefore I get into my question, here is what I have and what Im expectingp  ul liI have a strongWindows Formstrong which hosts strongWPFstrong in an strongElementHoststrong control.  li liAnd then, I have a strongWinforms UserControlstrong similar to DateTimePicker. Thisbr is hosted inside a strongWindowsFormsHoststrong control.li ul  pThe above scenario is unavoidable for the following reasonsp  ul liThe authorization dialog to all our applications is developed in Winforms, and takes a Winforms instance as its parameter. There is no WPF version introduced yet. Therefore, I had to use an ElementHost to host my View inside the Windows Form.li liThe Winforms control hosted inside my WPF is also unavoidable. We have our own DateTime Winforms UserControl that behaves similar to the DateTimePicker Winforms control, but has lot more complexities involved. So, replacing this control with a WPF version is out of question.li ul  pstrongExpected Functionalitystrong br I have a p  ul lipWPF control say, a textboxpli lipA DateTime Winforms UserControl that I was mentioning above.pli lipAnd a Cancel button that basically resets the above controls.pli ul  pWhen I hit the Cancel button, Im publishing an event from the codeViewModelcode, say strongRunViewModelstrong to the strongWPF UserControlstrong code behind file, say strongRunView.xaml.cs.strong p  precodeeventAggregator.GetEventltResetDateTimeEventgt.Publishtrue codepre  pIn the code behind file, Ive subscribed to the event as followsp  precodeeventAggregator.GetEventltResetDateTimeEventgt.SubscribeResetDateTimeHandler codepre  pThe strongWPFstrong control resets to its default value, but the strongDateTime UserControlstrong strongdoesstrong not reset.p  pSo, for testing purposes, I removed the ElementHost control, and just had my WPF View with a WindowsFormsHost control that hosts the DateTime Winforms UserControl, and a WPF Cancel button.p  pWhen I click on the button, the value on the DateTime control strongresetsstrong to its default value.p  pThen, I thought this might be an issue with my DateTime Winforms UserControl. So, I strongreplacedstrong my DateTime Winforms UserControl with a strongWinformsstrong strongTextboxstrong control in my actual application. So now the nesting is as followsp  blockquote   pWinFormsElementHostWPFWindowsFormsHostWinforms Textboxp blockquote  pHere is the xaml code.p  precodeltWindowsFormsHost xNameReportFromDtTmHost Margin8,0  Grid.Column0                                            LostFocusReportFromDtTmHostLostFocusgt       ltWindowsFormsHost.Childgt         ltwinformsTextBox xNameReportFromDateTimegt       ltWindowsFormsHost.Childgt ltWindowsFormsHostgt  codepre  pOn Initial load, Im loading the codeTextboxcode with codeInitial Load Textcode text p  precodeprivate void WindowLoadedobject sender, EventArgs e    ReportFromDateTime.Text  Initial Load Text  codepre  pAs I was mentioning above,  when I hit the Cancel button, this is what happensp  ul lipPublish the event from ViewModelp  peventAggregator.GetEvent.Publishtruepli lipSubscribe to the event in the code behind file xaml.csp  peventAggregator.GetEvent.SubscribeResetDateTimeHandlerpli lipEventHandler for the published event.p  pprivate void ResetDateTimeHandlerbool cancelClicked     ReportFromDateTime.Text  Reset to Default pli ul  pAs you can see in the above code, Im resetting the Text on clicking the Cancel button.p  pDuring Debugging, I could see the Text property being changed to Reset to Default, strongbut the UI does not show these changes.strongp  pHere is the wierd partp  pThe strongChildstrong property on the WindowsFormsHost control is different from the actual ReportFromDateTime Textbox control. p  pWhile debugging, I could see that the Child and Name property on the WindowsFormsHost control were different. The Name property is empty,p  precodeReportFromDtTmHost.Child.Name   codepre  pwhich rather should be strongReportFromDateTimestrong.p  pIt almost seems like the Host and the Child controls are getting recreated.p  pAs far as I see it, I think the extra level of nesting strongWinFormsElementHostWPFWindowsFormsHostWinforms Textboxstrong might be causing issues during the interoperations between WPF and Winforms. br Ive done a lot of research and searched lot of links for suggestions. I found none pointing out this issue. Some of them were close.

Here is what we did There were two ways to resolve this issue, but both were related to using static.p  pstrongStatic Winforms controlstrongp  pWe used the following static Winforms controlp  precodepublic static class ControlHolder    public static TextBox ReportFromDateTimeInstance  codepre  pIn the strongOnChangedstrong event of the actual control, we dump the actual control, ReportFromDateTime to the static control, ReportFromDateTimeInstance.p  precodeprivate void ReportFromDateTimeTextChangedobject sender, EventArgs e    ControlHolder.ReportFromDateTimeInstance  TextBoxsender  codepre  pAnd from then on, wherever we strongupdate the actual controlstrong as in strongcodeResetDateTimeHandlercodestrong method, we strongupdate the static controlstrongp  precodeprivate void ResetDateTimeHandlerbool cancelClicked    ControlHolder.ReportFromDateTimeInstance  Text changed  codepre  pstrongThis shows the updated value on the FrontEndstrongp  pstrongStatic EventAggregatorstrongp  pThis workaround was provided by one of our colleague.p  pIn this case, we are using our actual control, strongReportFromDateTimestrong, rather than the static control, codeControlHolder.ReportFromDateTimeInstancecodep  pWe used a strongstatic event aggregatorstrong for publishingsubscribing the ResetDateTimeEvent instead of using the Event Aggregator instance provided by Unity Container.

Negative 28 pI am currently using flexbox to create 2 equally sized in height DIVs. This works perfectly, however I one small issue.p  pThe first DIV contains a form and the second DIV contains some general text and a few images.p  pThe small issue I am experiencing is when the form expands, depending on the options the person selects. By expanding I mean the first DIV will increase in height. Thanks to flexbox the 2nd DIV also increase in height, to match the first one.p  pNow, as for the issue, since the content in the 2nd DIV is limited, it will create a lot of whitespace at the bottom of the DIV when the first DIV expands the one with the form.p  pI have been thinking about solutions, but clearly I havent found anything for it. I think the best solution to solve the amount of whitespace on the 2nd DIV is by making the space between the child DIVs in the 2nd DIV autmatically adjust. So when the form in the first DIV increase in height, it should add space between the different DIVs I use in the 2nd DIV.p  pAnother, and even better solution, would be that it would automatically show more or less child DIVs in the 2nd DIV depending on the height of the first DIV with the form.p  pI am good at explaining things much more difficult than it is, therefor I uploaded a Photoshopped screenshot to show what I mean and what problem I am experiencing.p  pAt the start of form img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGxseo.jpg altstart of formp  pWhen options are selected and form expands img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNHOpA.jpg altform expandingp  pThe form I am using is called MachForm.

Negative 28 pSuppose I have a decisionmaking problem that I want to map to a Markov Decision Process MDP problem. p  pFurthermore, suppose that some of the decisions the system needs to make depend on a decision that it has made previously, for example a robot would enter a specific room with a given probability only if the room is empty that is, only if a different robot hasnt previously made that same decision to enter the room.p  pMy question is how could I construct an MDP that takes previous decisions into account I was thinking of perhaps using two orthogonal regions in the MDP as it is used in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUMLstatemachineOrthogonalregions relnofollowUML state machinesa. That way, in my previous example about the robot, I have a separate statechart that could remember if there is currently a robot in the room. Additionally, Im not sure I could use an if checking a precondition before performing an action. I wonder if my approach is correctp  pThanks p

Negative 28 pIm trying to unmarshall an XML file into a generated class structure using JAXB in java.

The generated classes use some postgresql libraries that I put into the classloader, which is the resource Im having the issue with. JAXB correctly finds the ObjectFactory class in the supplied package, its just the instantiation of the generated classes themselves that seem be the problem.p  pThe result of running this code is that the manual call of codecl.loadClassorg.postgresql.util.PGIntervalcode works fine, it logs the the first statement saying that it found the class, no exceptions thrown.

Negative 28 pI have seen other people running to a similar issue but my case is a bit different. I am not sure if it is a MVVMCross issue or if there is something wrong with the Androind.Support.V4 library. I am using Xamarin Studio.p  pI have an activity that manages the FragmentDialog.p  pIn my OnCreate method, I check to see if an existing DialogFragment is being shown. This is for the case when a DialogFragment is already opened and a rotation occurs. On each OnCreate I look for the dialog using the tag I assigned. MVVMCross uses the support library as a part of its MXVFragmentAcitivity. I obtain the FragmentManager using the property SupportFragmenetManager which implement a getter private setters I believe.p  pThe first time the activity is created, everything works as desired. An already opened dialog would not cause any issue as it is being taken care of in the OnCreate method.p  pFirst thing I do is base.OnCreatebundle.p  pIssue comes in when I rotate the screen and then try to invoke my dialog.p  pBased on my debugging and tracing, when the rotation occurs, OnDetroy gets called as expected. I checked to see the state of SupportFragmentManager. At that point it is marked is destroyed.p  pWhen the new activity is created using the OnCreate, I check for the SupportFragmentManager and I see that there is a new instance. Makes sense.p  pI tracked it through OnViewModelSet and OnResume and it is all good.p  pOnce the view is all set, I click on my desired button to invoke the dialog. Same steps to invoke the dialog the first time.p  pThe app crashes on dialog.showSupportFragmentManager, dialogNamep  pI can see that the old SupportFragmentManager is being invoked. It does not make sense. I think the activity is reloading the old FragmentManger somehow. Is it possible it is being stored in the bundle and restored at one point. Based on Android documentation OnRestoreInstance occurs before OnResume. As mentioned before, when I check SupportFragmentManager in OnResume, it has a new value.p  pI am a bit confused. The exception received is java.lang.IllegalStateException Can not perform this action after onSaveInstanceStatep  pHere is a short version of the code I havep  pActivity OnCreatep  precodeprotected override void OnCreate Bundle bundle                      base.OnCreate bundle             SetContentView Resource.Layout.sessionpagelayout             Window.AddFlags WindowManagerFlags.KeepScreenOn              var existingDialog  ConnectionDialogFragmentSupportFragmentManager.FindFragmentByTagBLEDialogTagName             if existingDialog  null                 existingDialog.ViewModel  Mvx.GetSingletonltIDeviceListgt as DeviceListVMMvx.IocConstructltDeviceListVMgt           codepre  pFragmentDialog OnCreateDialogp  precodepublic override Dialog OnCreateDialogBundle savedState                      base.EnsureBindingContextSetsavedState             var view  this.BindingInflateResource.Layout.DeviceListView, null             var dialog  new AlertDialog.BuilderActivity             dialog.SetTitletitle             dialog.SetViewview             dialog.SetNeutralButtonClose, s, a gt  Dismiss             return dialog.Create          codepre  pand the invoke from Activityp  precodeprivate void ShowDeviceDialog                      var dialog  new ConnectionDialogFragment              Removed ViewModel setting as it is irrelavent             dialog.Show SupportFragmentManager, BLEDialogTagName            codepre  pI appreciate if someone can shed some light on this issue. I have seen similar issue but it seems those are related to rotation and app crashes while the dialog is up. Again, I get no crash when a dialog is up and a rotation occurs. The state of SupportFragmentManager is good and correct in OnCreate. Temporary fix is to lock the screen to an orientation. I am locking it to Portrait until I can figure out the issue.p

Negative 28 pGood day. I have an Android Application, and theres a part where the user can use an codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode to select names. The user can select a name and then details such as address would appear in the next activity. What I do is that when the user selects a name, I get that names position from the codeArrayListcode, and go to my Address ArrayList, get the address at the same position, and then I have my data.p  pHowever, some of the names tend to repeat, for example, I have a Name ArrayList as suchp  precode[A, B, B, C] codepre  pand an Address ArrayList as suchp  precode[Address A, Address B, Address C, Address D] codepre  pwhen the user clicks the 2nd B in the AutoCompleteTextView, the position returned will be that of the first B, NOT the second B, and therefore, it will give the Address B instead of Address C.p  pIve looked around and Ive tried to make my custom codeArrayAdaptercode for my codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode to display my custom class with the Name and the Address. However, I did not have much luck with that.p  pThe next thing I looked into was to using a codeHashMapltString, Stringgtcode as shown in thisa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16782288autocompletetextviewwithcustomadapterandfilterStackOverflow Questiona. It is very similar to what is used for a Custom ListView, only that it has a codegetFiltercode function.

However, what I do in my codegetFiltercode function is that when I have a codeconstraintcode given, I check if the codekeycode part contains the constraints, I add those. p  pThis works well, I am told by my LogCat that if I type a certain character, my resulting HashMap would contain the entries with the constrains only.p  pHowever, what happens is that when I type in a 2nd succeeding character, the filter does not seem to work any more. I am given a blank filtered result HashMap and the dropdown menu reflects the blank result cuz I dont have any suggestive text any more.p  pCan anyone tell me how to implement a Filterable ArrayAdapter properly Any help is very much appreciated. Thank you. p

Negative 28 pI have been asked to use ForkJoin to write the following methodp  precodepublic static boolean hasOverint val, int[] arr, int sequentialCutoff codepre  pand my code must have a work of On, a span of Olgn and use the sequentialCutoff argument. I figured this problem would be fairly straight forward and one in which sequentialCutoff would set the threshold, and the recursion would occur over half the array, repeating until hitting the threshold, before hitting the base case which would just traverse the array over the specified indices, checking to see if any elements greater than val exist. Here is the parallel code portion of what I wrotep  precodeprotected Boolean compute      ifhigh  lo lt sequentialCutoff          return sequentialCheckHasOvercheck, array      else          int mid  lo  high  lo  2         CheckHasOver left  new CheckHasOvercheck, array, lo, mid, cutoff         left.fork         CheckHasOver right  new CheckHasOvercheck, array, mid, high, cutoff         return right.compute  left.join       codepre  pThe problem is that when I now run timing tests on the code that I wrote, no matter what threshold I choose, the sequential code is running faster than my parallel code and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out where my reasoning has failed. Can anyone see a mistake in what Ive done Some help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 28 pIm trying to find a pattern to use when synchronising multipart asynchronous operations. Lets say the OS offers a service which can be startedstopped. Take the following examplep  ol liStart is called. Ask the daemon to start.li liThe daemon responds successfully. Do some other operation, such as setting necessary state of operation.li liThe daemon responds, we are done.li ol  pWhat I want is to prevent activities from overlapping. Say that while 1. is processing a stop request or another start is issued. That request must hold until 3. completes.p  pI know about a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualConcurrencyProgrammingGuideOperationQueuesOperationQueues.html relnofollowdispatches queuesa and Im actually using them, but they prevent each strongstepstrong from overlapping, not the entire operation. I tried using locks but I get an instant log from iOS telling me that a dead lock occurred I dont release the lock until 3. finishes. I also tried some adhoc approaches but they have been revealing hard to use. My last attemptp  precodeinterface HYPAtomizer  NSObject   Indicates that the operation is running. A start request was successful     property readonly BOOL isRunning   Whether the operationdaemon should be running property readonly BOOL isRunningRequested   Whether we are currently processing a request property readonly BOOL isProcessing   Whether an error occurred property readonly NSError  error   instancetypeinit NSDESIGNATEDINITIALIZER  instancetypeatomizer   These methods return YES if I should proceed with the request, meaning that its not overlapping  BOOLstartIfPossible  BOOLstopIfPossible   Call these by the time a request finishes. They will say whether to revert the process, meaning that a request happened during processing that requires the state to turn back such as a stop request being issued during a start process  BOOLrevertStartIfNeededNSError error  BOOLrevertStopIfNeededNSError error   A spontaneous stoppage occurred, such as the daemon stopping by itself  voidnotifyStoppageNSError error  end codepre  pI then call these methods at key points, but its been proving hard to find those key points. Is there a standard methodp  pEdit for clarification purposesp  pSteps on any given activity dont repeat, but they are not mandatory either. As such, a start operation can execute 1, 2, and 3, but it could also stop at 2 if that step detects an error and 3 never gets executed. Steps dont repeat, so 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3 is not possible. These situations are possiblep  precode[lock] 1, 2  fail [unlock] [lock] 1, 2, 3  success [unlock] codepre  pIf in the meanwhile while Im waiting for the daemon stronganystrong other operation is attempt, be it either start or stop, it shouldnt execute, but instead update a flag indicating what the current state should be. Lets say that codestartcode is a start request and codestopcode the opposite activity. The following would happenp  precodestart [lock] 1, 2, 3 [unlocked]stop [lock] 1, 2 [unlock] start [lock] 1, 2, stop, 3 [unlock] [lock] 1, 2 [unlock] codepre  pThe codestopcode request in the last example was called by a foreign source, its not part of the start process. As you can see by the time that start finishes I want it to stop, because it was requested in the meanwhile. Finally, if more actions overlapp  precodestart [lock] 1, stop, 2, start, 3 [unlock]  nothing happens codepre  pIn this case nothing happens because by the time the process is finishes its already in the last requested state start.p  pEdit BTW, Im just thinking of implementing a simple lock mechanism like described.p

Negative 28 pI am working on a rope swinging game in Xcode using Swift and SpriteKit, where the ropes are made out of a series of SKSpriteNodes called ropeNodes that are held together by a series of SKPhysicsJointPins. Once the player swings past the middle of the screen, the screen or camera centers on the player. This is accomplished by altering the anchorpoint of the scene each time a frame is rendered, so that the player is always in the middle of the screen, and most of the obstacles and ropes etc. move leftward across the screen. At the start of the game, self.anchorpoint is set to 0,0. The issue is that once the anchorpoint of the scene starts to move aka the player has reached that halfway point across the screen, if the user touches the screen and tries to create a new rope, the SKPhysicsJointPins that hold the rope together will not be in place, causing the rope to immediately fall apart. p  pIf I remove the line of code in the update method that says p  pcodeself.anchorPoint  CGPointx 0.5  player.position.xpixels, y 0.0code, then the user can touch the screen at any point, even if the player is on the rightmost side of the screen, and the rope will form just fine, so Im quite sure that the issue has something to do with the anchorpoint. How exactly does changing the anchorpoint screw up the SKPhysicsJointPins, and what could I do to fix the problem Thanks in advance p  precodefunc createRopeNodepos CGPoint gt SKSpriteNode     let ropeNode  SKSpriteNodeimageNamed Ball     ropeNode.size  CGSizewidth 5, height 5     ropeNode.physicsBody  SKPhysicsBodyrectangleOfSize ropeNode.size     ropeNode.physicsBody.affectedByGravity  true     ropeNode.physicsBody.collisionBitMask  0     ropeNode.alpha  1     ropeNode.position  CGPointx pos.x  0, y pos.y     ropeNode.name  RopePiece     let text  SKSpriteNodeimageNamed RopeTexture     ropeNode.zPosition  5     text.runActionSKAction.rotateByAngleatan2dx, dy, duration 0     ropeNode.addChildtext     return ropeNode  override func touchesBegantouches SetltNSObjectgt, withEvent event UIEvent       Called when a touch begins       if playerIsConnected         playerIsConnected  true         for touch in touches as SetltUITouchgt              let location  touch.locationInNodeself             dx  pin.position.x  player.position.x             dy  pin.position.y  player.position.y             let length  sqrtpowdx, 2  powdy, 2             let distanceBetweenRopeNodes  5             let numberOfPieces  IntlengthdistanceBetweenRopeNodes             var ropeNodes  [SKSpriteNode]              adds the pieces to the array at respective locations             for var index  0 index lt numberOfPieces index                 let point  CGPointx pin.position.x  CGFloatindex  distanceBetweenRopeNodes  sinatan2dy, dx  1.5707, y pin.position.y  CGFloatindex  distanceBetweenRopeNodes  cosatan2dy, dx  1.5707                 let piece  createRopeNodepoint                 ropeNodes.appendpiece                 self.addChildropeNodes[index]                          Adds the joint connecting the pin to the first ropeNode             let firstJoint  SKPhysicsJointPin.jointWithBodyAropeNodes[0].physicsBody, bodyB pin.physicsBody, anchor                 CGPointx ropeNodes[0].position.x  pin.position.x2, y ropeNodes[0].position.y  pin.position.y2             firstJoint.frictionTorque  1             self.physicsWorld.addJointfirstJoint             adds the joints that hold together each pair of ropeNodes in the rope             for var i  1 i lt ropeNodes.count i                 let nodeA  ropeNodes[i  1]                 let nodeB  ropeNodes[i]                 let middlePoint  CGPointx nodeA.position.x  nodeB.position.x2, y nodeA.position.y  nodeB.position.y2                 let joint  SKPhysicsJointPin.jointWithBodyAnodeA.physicsBody, bodyB nodeB.physicsBody, anchor middlePoint                 joint.frictionTorque  0.1                 self.physicsWorld.addJointjoint                          adds the joint connecting the final ropeNode to the player             finalJoint  SKPhysicsJointPin.jointWithBodyAropeNodes[ropeNodes.count  1].physicsBody, bodyB player.physicsBody, anchor                 CGPointx ropeNodes[ropeNodes.count  1].position.x  player.position.x2, y ropeNodes[ropeNodes.count  1].position.y  player.position.y2             finalJoint.frictionTorque  1             self.physicsWorld.addJointfinalJoint                   else         disconnects the player from the rope         player.physicsBody.applyImpulseCGVectordx player.physicsBody.velocity.dx130, dy  player.physicsBody.velocity.dy130         physicsWorld.removeJointfinalJoint         playerIsConnected  false        override func updatecurrentTime CFTimeInterval       Called before each frame is rendered      moves the anchorpoint so the player is always in the middle of the screen     if player.position.x gt self.size.width2         let pixels CGFloat  1024         self.anchorPoint  CGPointx 0.5  player.position.xpixels, y 0.0       codepre  pp
Negative 28 pI wish to zip a directory on the server and download it to the user.  Ive found great information on this site on how to zip the directory.p  pThe part that has me stumped is where to store the temporary file.  From what Ive read, codezipArchivecode requires that the zip file be saved on the server, and I cant download it without saving it.  Correctp  pIve seen solutions where they recommend saving it as somename.zip, and then using codereadfilecode along with the appropriate headers to download, and then using codeunlinkcode after the download to get rid of it.  But where to store somename.zip and what if there are collisionsp  pSo, then I started thinking that I should create a file with a random name in some temporary directory.  Or maybe I should use something like codetmpfilecode, but that returns a file handler and I dont know how that will work with zipArchive.p  pFor my application, the size of the directory is fairly small, and would like to not even write it to disk, but to memory instead.  Maybe something like codetmphandle  fopenphptemp, rcode, but again this returns a file handler and I dont know how that will work with zipArchive.p  pHow should the zip file created by zipArchive be temporary savedp

Negative 28 pTLDR I have an application that is reading messages from a USB device in the background, and displaying the messages on the screen. I am using a BlockingCollection, as I need to read messages quickly so the device does not get a BufferOverflow.p  pI am reading messages like this my producerp  precodeprivate void ReadMessagesBlockingCollectionltobjectgt logMessages     uint numMsgs    Status status    Message[] msgs  new Message[10]    whilelogMessages.IsAddingCompleted           numMsgs  uint msgs.Length       status  readMessageschannel, msgs, ref numMsgs, 1000       ifstatus  Status.ERRBUFFEROVERFLOW                 logMessages.AddBUFFER OVERFLOW  MESSAGES LOST          logMessages.AddCopyMessagesmsgs, numMsgs              else ifstatus  Status.STATUSNOERROR                 logMessages.AddCopyMessagesmsgs, numMsgs              else                 throw new ExceptionError         codepre  pThe readMessages method will fill the codemsgscode array with the codeMessagecode objects read, and the codenumMsgscode reference holds the number of messages that were read up to 10. I use a function called codeCopyMessagescode so I only pass a codeMessage[]code that is the right size. i.e. if 5 messages are read, I send a codeMessage[5]code instead of codeMessage[10]code.p  pI read the messages my consumer like thisp  precodeprivate void DisplayMessagesBlockingCollectionltobjectgt messages      string[] msgs     try              foreach var item in messages.GetConsumingEnumerablecancellationTokenSource.Token                      if item is string                              msgs  new string[]  item.ToString                           else if item is PassThruMsg[]                              msgs  FormatMessagesPassThruMsg[]item                          else                              msgs  new string[0]                           Task.Factory.StartNewnew Action gt outputTextBox.AppendTextString.JoinEnvironment.NewLine, msgs  Environment.NewLine, cancellationTokenSource.Token, TaskCreationOptions.None, uiContext                   catch OperationCanceledException              TODO       codepre  pI start the tasks inside a button click, like thisp  precodevar results  new BlockingCollectionltobjectgt  var display  Task.Factory.StartNew gt DisplayMessagesresults var readMessages  Task.Factory.StartNew gt ReadMessagesresults  Task[] tasks  new Task[]  display, readMessages   try      await Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAlltasks, result gt  results.CompleteAdding , cancellationTokenSource.Token, TaskContinuationOptions.None, uiContext  catch TaskCanceledException      TODO  codepre  pThis works fine, and when running idly it prints the messages from the device without a problem. However, after the device starts doing work under a really heavy load the consumer is called so quickly it locks the UI temporarily that I notice the output textbox is repeating values. It is my understanding that codeGetConsumingEnumerablecode also removes items from the blocking collection, but I dont know why else I would see the messages printed multiple times. Each message has a timestamp, and when I readMessages from the device it clears the buffer so I know that I am not reading that message multiple times.p  pAm I missing something here Is there a better way to handle this producerconsumer scenario to ensure accurate data I have looked to see if there are references somewhere that may be overlapping, but I dont see it. p
