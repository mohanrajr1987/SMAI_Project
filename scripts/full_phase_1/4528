This part is not working once we try to redirect from http to https.p  pAll works IF we change the url call from http to https on the mobile end as a hrefhttpswww.testsite.comGenericHandler.ashx relnofollowhttpswww.testsite.comGenericHandler.ashxa.p  pHow can we handle the calls which come through the handler p  pBtw, you may be wondering why cannot we change it right away because the mobile application is on the production so the changes will take time to get on the live.p  pI hope that I have been clear and I really appreciate your help and time. Thank youp

Positive 4528 pSo to start, we have a Windows Server 2008 R2 running multiple websites under our main domain, so it will be domain.comsite.  The sites were created by someone else using mainly PHP, with a few ASP.Net pages, and only the ASP.Net pages broke after we installed SharePoint 2013 on our server SharePoint was not installed on it before.p  pThe main issue we first saw was a configuration error referencing a problem connecting to the SharePoint farm, which was the application pool in IIS was using user credentials that could not access a part of SharePoint.  This is most likely a configuration somewhere, but I could not find out where wasnt in Global Web.Config, Machine.Config, or any Web.Config i could find.p  pBecause the User Credentials fixed that error, we received another config error that said codePlatformNotSupportedException Operation is not supported on this platform.code  This pointed to the application pool being set to classic instead of integrated, and heres where Im at.  If I set the application pool which is .Net v4.0 btw to Integrated, the error goes away, but the entire site outside of SharePoint pulls up blank.  In the developer tools in Chrome, all i see is a 500 error Internal Server Error and nothing else.p  pIf I set the application pool back to classic, the PHP pages will load up fine, but the ASPX pages will load up with the codePlatformNotSupportedExceptioncode error.p  pException information p  precodeException type PlatformNotSupportedException  Exception message Operation is not supported on this platform.  at System.Web.HttpServerVarsCollection.SetString name, String value at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPTokenCache.ReadTokenByte[] token at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.SessionSecurityTokenHandler.ReadTokenByte[] token, SecurityTokenResolver tokenResolver at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.ReadSessionTokenFromCookieByte[] sessionCookie at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.TryReadSessionTokenFromCookieSessionSecurityTokenamp sessionToken at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPSessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStepIExecutionStep step, Booleanamp completedSynchronously codepre  pIn this exception message, it references SharePoint configurations the site is not using.  Now this could belong in the SharePoint StackExchange except that SharePoint is working, but since this affects the configuration on a web siteapplication, I was hoping someone might have an idea where the site is pulling the configuration that shows up in the error.p  pstrongSite Setup in IISstrongp  precodeApplication Pools Sites gtSharePoint URL domain.com gtgtWebApp domain.comWebApp codepre  pThe codeWebAppcode page is on a separate application pool, and I assume it needs to run on code.Net v4.0code classic mode.  The PHP pages work fine with it set to classic, but part of the problem is the ASPX pages.  If I can find out where its pulling those configurations, Im hoping I can have some way to remove them from just the 1 site without affecting SharePoint.p  pIm hoping i did not miss anything important, but if I missed anything I will edit my post later to include more information.  I also dont fully understand how the configuration files work with sites in IIS, because it appears those configurations are inherited from somewhere.p  pstrongNote I did not design the WebApp page, and the person who did no longer works for us.strongp

Negative 4528 pThe desired functionality of the enhanced combo box is a quick find method. Each item in the combobox has a ToString method, such that they can be displayed in the drop down list. On clicking an item in the drop down list, the comboboxs observers are notified of the selection.p  pAlso, every time the typed text in the combobox changes, a list of Candidates is generated, made of all those items in the drop down list which contain the text typed in so far. Hitting enter takes you to the first candidate in that list, repeatedly hitting enter cycles you through the list.p  pIve implemented this functionality by deriving from ComboBox  I figured this made sense as Im still functionally left with a combobox, it just has this QuickFind feature added. However, the logic to create the candidate list and cycle through it, whilst simple, isnt totally trivial, and would enjoy some testing.p  pHowever, as seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions479587testingcustomcontrolderivedfromcomboboxherea it doesnt seem to be all that easy to test a ComboBox just by constructing it and prodding the extra routines Ive added  it needs to exist on a form for it to behave the same way as it does in the application.  This seems altogether too much effort to test a simple addition to a simple combo boxp  pNothing in the code to cycle through the candidates is specific to my application however  I have created a general control that may be used in any number of contexts, the only requirement being that the objects in the combobox have a ToString methiod, which is the same restriction placed on objects going into normal comboboxes anyway, and is guaranteed by C .NET.p  pSo, with testability in mind, where would you put the enhanced functionalityp

Negative 4528 pI want to render a lot of circles or small graphics within either silverlight or wpf around 100010000 as fast and as frequently as possible.  If I have to go to DX or OGL, thats fine, but Im wondering about doing this within either of those two frameworks first read its OK if an answer is WPFonly or Silverlightonly.  Also, if there is a way to access DX through WPF and render on a surface that way, I would be interested in that as well.p  pSo, whats the fastest way to draw a load of circles  They can be as plain as necessary, but they do need to have a radius.  Currently Im using DrawingVisual and a DrawingContext.DrawEllipse command for each circle, then rendering the visual to a RenderTargetBItmap, but it becomes very slow as the number of circles rises.  p  pBy the way, these circles move every frame, so caching isnt really an option unless youre going to suggest caching the individual circles . . .

Negative 4528 pstrongA little background on the application that I am gonna talk about in the next few linesstrong p  pstrongXYZstrong is a data masking workbench eclipse RCP application You give it a source table column, and a target table column, it would apply a trasformation encryptionshufflingetc and copy the row data from source table to target table. Now, when I mask n tables at a time, n threads are launched by this app. p  pstrongHere is the issuestrongp  pI have run into a production issue on first roll out of the above said app. Unfortunately, I dont have any logs to get to the root. However, I tried to run this app in test region and do a stress test. p  pWhen I collected .hprof files and ran em through an analyzer yourKit, I noticed that objects of oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement were retaining heap. The analysis also tells me that one of my classes is holding a reference to this preparedstatement object and thereby, n threads have n such objects. T4CPreparedStatement seemed to have character arrays lastBoundChars and bindChars each of size char[300000]. p  pSo, I researched a bit google, obtained ojdbc6.jar and tried decompiling T4CPreparedStatement. I see that T4CPreparedStatement extends OraclePreparedStatement, which dynamically manages array size of lastBoundChars and bindChars. p  pSo, my questions here are p  ol liHave you ever run into an issue like thisli liDo you know the significance of lastBoundChars  bindCharsli liI am new to profiling, so do you think I am not doing it correct I also ran the hprofs through MAT  and this was the main identified issue  so, I dont really think I could be wrongli ol  pI have found something similar on the web here  a hrefhttpforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspamessageID2860681httpforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspamessageID2860681ap  pAppreciate your suggestions  advice. p
Negative 4528 pWhat is the best way to implement an interface that combines some instances of the same interface in various specified ways I need to do this for multiple interfaces and I want to minimize the boilerplate and still achieve good efficiency, because I need this for a critical production system.p  pHere is a sketch of the problem.p  pAbstractly, I have a generic combiner class which takes the instances and specify the various combinatorsp  precodeclass CombinerltIgt     I[] instances     ltTgt T combineSomeWayInstanceMethodltI,Tgt method        ... method.callinstances[i] ... combined in some way ...          more combinators  codepre  pNow, lets say I want to implement the following interface among many othersp  precodeInterface Foo    String barint baz  codepre  pI want to end up with code like thisp  precodeclass FooCombiner implements Foo    CombinerltFoogt combiner    Override    public String barfinal int baz      return combiner.combineSomeWaynew InstanceMethodltFoo, Stringgt        Override public callFoo instance  return instance.barbaz            codepre  pNow, this can quickly get long and winded if the interfaces have lots of methods.

Negative 4528 pNot sure if this has been asked before, but I have an object Restaurant and I have a details view of that restaurant.  On that details view, I want to have a list of cuisines that the restaurant offers.  I want to also have a dropdownlist of the available cuisines and have the ability to click an Add button and it adds that cuisine to the Restaurant.  I have a RestaurantCuisine table using Entity Framework that has a foreign key of the ID of the cuisine from a Cuisine table that has a primary key of ID.  p  pstrikeSo, now, my question, how do I do this  I sortof understand the concept behind the Create view and then the Create view post, but in this case, Im not posting back the Restaurant object.  So, how do I get the restaurant ID and the Cuisine ID so that I can add that to the restaurant cuisine collectionstrikep  pOk, so, now after investigating more, I believe I have asked the wrong question.  My actual issue, is that I have a View that displays a Restaurants details and I have a Details function in my controller for it.  This works fine.  The next step I want to do is have a dropdownlist with available Cuisines that this restaurant offers and have an Add button next to it.  And if you click on the Add button, it adds the value of the item in the dropdownlist to the collection of cuisines setup in the Restaurant object.  p  pIs this easily possible  Im beginning to lose my faith in MVC2 p  pOk, last try here.  Let me ask this, does anyone know how to have a dropdownlist I have now got this created and have an Add button next to it, and get the selected value from that dropdownlistp

Negative 4528 pIm trying to find a generic way to track Modified of any control databind or not in the current window this is e.g. to enable or disable the Apply button in a typical Options window.  In fact, I just need to hook up a few event handlers like ComboBox.SelectionChanged or TextBox.TextChanged. In WinForms I had to loop through all controls in the form and hook up those events one by one, and it worked. In WPF, I thought I could get it done with much less code likep  precodeEventManager.RegisterClassHandler typeofMyCtrl                                  , ComboBox.SelectionChangedEvent                                  , new RoutedEventHandlerOnChanged codepre  pWith this one line code, I would be able to wire up comoboboxs selection changed event for all comboboxes in MyCtrl. However, the problem I ran into is that, if I see it correctly, this event is also fired when there is another control in the window that is not a combobox but also derived from codeSelectorcode. For example, I also have a datagrid on the same window actually there is no combobox column in the datagrid, this event is also fired when I select a different row.p  pSo, it appears that the above line of code hooks up the SelectionChanged event for all controls derived from codeSelectorcode base, not just combobox.p  pIs this right How can I just hook up the SelectionChanged event for all comboboxesp  pEDIT with more examples On the same control, I have a comboxbox and a button and I want to track Button.Click and ComboBox.SelectionChanged event as followsp  precodeEventManager.RegisterClassHandler typeofMyCtrl                                  , ComboBox.SelectionChangedEvent                                  , new RoutedEventHandlerOnChanged EventManager.RegisterClassHandler typeofMyCtrl                                  , Button.ClickEvent                                  , new RoutedEventHandlerOnChanged codepre  pThe problem is that I get Button.Click event right after I clicked the ComboBox dropdown button.

I could not find an answer through Google...p  pI am using PyFFTW in my code, which has a planning stage, where you pass it the two variables sourcedestination, that your transforming fromto. It will then, when you call the FFT operate on the exact memory space, where those variables were located during the planning stage.

I found the operators codecode, codecode, etc., which do this for standard mathematical operators. However in my program I need to apply a function to the variable, which should return it to the same memory location.

Negative 4528 pI have installed an application and each file saved is .mdf. During installation of the software I have not seen any database being installed, and after installation I checked my program files and not SQL server or other database server being installed.

Negative 4528 pI have a highpriority process that needs to pass data to a lowpriority process. Ive written a basic ring buffer to handle the passing of datap  precodeclass RingBuffer    public     RingBufferint size     RingBuffer      int count return size  end  start  size      void writechar data, int bytes         some work that uses only buffer and end       end  end  bytes  size           void readchar data, int bytes         some work that uses only buffer and start       start  start  bytes  size         private     char buffer     const int size     int start, end  codepre  pHeres the problem. Suppose the lowpriority process has an oracle that tells it exactly how much data needs to be read, so that codecountcode need never be called. Then unless Im missing something there are no concurrency issues. However, as soon as the lowpriority thread needs to call codecountcode the highpriority thread might want to call it too to check if the buffer is too full there is the possibility that the math in count or the update to end is not atomic, introducing a bug.p  pI could put a mutex around the accesses to start and end but that would cause priority inversion if the highpriority thread has to wait for the lock acquired by the lowpriority thread.p  pI might be able to work something out using atomic operations but Im not aware of a nice, crossplatform library providing these. p  pIs there a standard ringbuffer design that avoids these issuesp
Negative 4528 pIm storing categories using a hierarchical model like sop  precodeCATEGORIES id  parentid  name  1   0          Cars 2   0          Planes 3   1          Hatchbacks 4   1          Convertibles 5   2          Jets 6   3          Peugeot 7   3          BMW 8   6          206 9   6          306 codepre  pI then store actual data with one of these category ids like sop  precodeCARS vehicleid  categoryid  name  1           8            Really fast silver Peugeot 206  2           9            Really fast silver Peugeot 306  3           5            Really fast Boeing 747 4           3            Another Peugeot but only in Hatchbacks category codepre  pWhen searching for any of this data, I would like to find all child  grandchild  great grandchild etc. etc. nodes. So if someone wants to see all Cars, they see everything with a parentid of Hatchbacks, and so everything with a parentid of Peugeot, and so on, to an arbitrary level. p  pSo if I list a really fast Peugeot 206 with a categoryid of either 1, 3, 6, or 8, my query should be able to travel up the tree and find any higher categories which are parentsgrandparents of that child category. E.g. a user searching for Peugeots in category 8 should find any Peugeots listed with categories 6, 3, or 1  all of which category 8s descendants. p  pE.g. using the above data, searching for Peugeot in category 3 should actually find vehicles 1, 2 and 4, because vehicles 1 and 2 have a category ancestor trail which leads back up to category 3.

Its difficult Thank you, though.p  pNote I have read a hrefhttpmikehillyer.comarticlesmanaginghierarchicaldatainmysql relnofollowthe MySQL dev article on hierarchiesa.p

Negative 4528 pIm writing a game that has two sets of buttons.

Negative 4528 pI have a ASP.net page that contains a TreeView that is updated dynamically. I have encountered a problem using the TreeNodeCollection that I can not figure out the reasons behind. p  pThe following code is a much simplified replication of the issue, when the pageload event fires a treeview control is created with a root node, then a function is called that returns a collection of nodes and subnodes. A For Next loops traverses the collection and adds the nodes to the root node. The TreeView control is then added to the page. The example below works as I expected.p  precode  Protected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load         Dim treeView1 As New TreeView         treeView1.Nodes.AddNew TreeNode          Dim nodeCollection As TreeNodeCollection  GetNodes           For nodeIndex  0 To nodeCollection.Count  1             treeView1.Nodes0.ChildNodes.AddnodeCollectionnodeIndex         Next          Me.Form.Controls.AddtreeView1     End Sub      Function GetNodes As TreeNodeCollection         Dim tnc As New TreeNodeCollection, tn As New TreeNode, sn As New TreeNode         For i  0 To 4             tn  New TreeNodeNode amp i             tn.ChildNodes.AddNew TreeNodeSubnode1             tn.ChildNodes.AddNew TreeNodeSubnode2             tn.ChildNodes.AddNew TreeNodeSubnode3             tnc.Addtn         Next         Return tnc     End Function codepre  pTo replicate the problem I change the line codeReturn tnccode in the GetNodes function with codeReturn tnc1.ChildNodescodep  pThe function still returns a valid TreeNodeCollection of the three sub nodes that were initially added to Node1.p  pNow when the codes begins to traverse the collection, in the codeFor Nextcode loop each time a node is added to treeView1 control it is removed from the nodeCollection This subsequently messes up for next loop and an Index was out of range error is thrown.p  pWhy after the code change are nodes moved from the collection, when in the initial example the nodeCollection retains all its items.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf I change the For Next loop to a For Each loop then the exception is slightly different e.gp  precodeFor Each thisNode AS TreeNode In nodeCollection     treeView1.Nodes0.ChildNodes.AddthisNode Next codepre  pgenerates the exceptionp  blockquote   pCollection was modified enumeration operation may not execute.p blockquote  pWhich kind of makes sense as the current node for whatever reason is being moved from the source collection to the treeview. But why doesnt this happen when codeReturn tnccode is usedp

Later the program has to write on the screen everything about every line. No matter what coordinates I insert, the coordinates of the first dot are X  9,25596e061 and Y  9,25596e061. But the other dots have the coordinates I have originally inserted.p  pThere is one line that I add to a vector as much times as the number of the sides of the figure. After that I start changing the values of the coordinates of the edges of the figure by inserting the values in the running program. The third action is to call the functionmethod that creates the lines It calculates the rest of the data about the line. The fourth step of the program is to write on the screen the data about every line.p  pI have been searching for a problem in the algorithm and the code.

Negative 4528 pJava seems to be hanging when incrementing a foreach loop. I cant find anybody out there with a similar problem, so maybe Im just doing something wrong, but I cant imagine what it is. Im pulling out a set of Nodes from a Neo4J database, then iterating through it. I dont modify that set of Nodes during the loop, but after a while, it hangs. Heres the code that does itp  precode        IndexHitsltNodegt usrs  users.getType, User         System.out.printlnOperating on usrs.size Users          for Node u  usrs              System.out.print.             if inUserBlacklistu                 continue             System.out.printlnHA          codepre  pAll that inUserBlacklistu does is check the Node u against a preset Set of Nodes to see if the Node is part of the blacklist. It doesnt change anything about the Node u.p  pUsers is a Neo4J index, so calling get on it should return an iterable IndexHits object. This foreach loop runs through the foreach loop 269,938 times. At the end of that iteration, it prints HA, but then it never prints another .. It just hangs at that point, right before iteration 269,939. That puts it as blocking on the foreach loop. There should be 270,012 total iterations.p  pI noticed that my blacklist contains 74 items, all of which should be matched once while going through this loop. 270,012  74  269,938, but that doesnt explain why its blocking. All I can figure is that the foreach loop is incrementing the position on the iterator without incrementing its counter when I call continue. Then it gets to the end of the set and has nothing more, but the counter thinks it is only at 269,938 out of 270,012.p  pDo any of you know why a foreach loop would behave like thisp  pEDIT A stack trace shows that the process is indeed stuck on the for loop line 116p  precode   java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE        at sun.nio.ch.FileDispatcher.pread0Native Method        at sun.nio.ch.FileDispatcher.preadFileDispatcher.java49        at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.readIntoNativeBufferIOUtil.java248        at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.readIOUtil.java224        at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.readFileChannelImpl.java663        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.PersistenceRow.readPositionPersistenceRow.java91        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.PersistenceWindowPool.acquirePersistenceWindowPool.java177        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.CommonAbstractStore.acquireWindowCommonAbstractStore.java559        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.RelationshipStore.getChainRecordRelationshipStore.java349        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.xa.ReadTransaction.getMoreRelationshipsReadTransaction.java121        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.xa.ReadTransaction.getMoreRelationshipsReadTransaction.java104        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.persistence.PersistenceManager.getMoreRelationshipsPersistenceManager.java108        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeManager.getMoreRelationshipsNodeManager.java666        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeImpl.getMoreRelationshipsNodeImpl.java427         locked lt0x77c9b4a0gt a org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeImpl        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.IntArrayIterator.fetchNextOrNullIntArrayIterator.java91        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.IntArrayIterator.fetchNextOrNullIntArrayIterator.java36        at org.neo4j.helpers.collection.PrefetchingIterator.hasNextPrefetchingIterator.java55        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.traversal.TraversalBranchImpl.nextTraversalBranchImpl.java128        at org.neo4j.kernel.PreorderBreadthFirstSelector.nextPreorderBreadthFirstSelector.java48        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.traversal.TraverserImplTraverserIterator.fetchNextOrNullTraverserImpl.java127        at org.neo4j.kernel.impl.traversal.TraverserImplTraverserIterator.fetchNextOrNullTraverserImpl.java94        at org.neo4j.helpers.collection.PrefetchingIterator.hasNextPrefetchingIterator.java55        at org.neo4j.helpers.collection.IteratorWrapper.hasNextIteratorWrapper.java42        at NodePlacement.LoadFromNodeNodePlacement.java116 codepre  pSo...it looks like the thread is still running and not blocked on anything.

Negative 4528 pWhen conjoining socket.ionode.js and redis pubsub in an attempt to create a realtime web broadcast system driven by server events that can handle multiple transports, there seems to be three approachesp  ol lipcreateClient a redis connection and subscribe to channels.  On socket.io client connection, join the client into a socket.io room.  In the redis.onmessage, ... event, call io.sockets.inroom.emitevent, data to distribute to all clients in the relevant room.  Like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5739357howtoreuseredisconnectioninsocketioHow to reuse redis connection in socket.ioapli lipcreateClient a redis connection.  On socket.io client connection, join the client into a socket.io room and subscribe to relevant redis channels.  Include redis.onmessage, ... inside the client connection closure and on receipt of message call client.emitevent, data to raise the event on the specific client.  Like the answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9267292examplesinusingredisstoreinsocketioExamples in using RedisStore in socket.ioapli lipUse the RedisStore baked into socket.io and broadcast from the single dispatch channel in Redis following the socketiospec protocol.pli ol  pNumber 1 allows handling the Redis sub and associated event once for all clients.  Number 2 offers a more direct hook into Redis pubsub.  Number 3 is simpler, but offers little control over the messaging events.p  pHowever, in my tests, all exhibit unexpectedly low performance with more than 1 connected client.  The server events in question are 1,000 messages published to a redis channel as quickly as possible, to be distributed as quickly as possible.  Performance is measured by timings at the connected clients socket.ioclient based that log timestamps into a Redis list for analysis.p  pWhat I surmise is that in option 1, server receives the message, then sequentially writes it to all connected clients.  In option 2, server receives each message multiple times once per client subscription and writes it to the relevant client.  In either case, the server doesnt get to the second message event until its communicated to all connected clients.  A situation clearly exacerbated with rising concurrency.p  pThis seems at odds with the perceived wisdom of the stacks capabilities.  I want to believe, but Im struggling.p  pIs this scenario low latency distribution of high volume of messages just not an option with these tools yet, or am I missing a trickp

Negative 4528 pI have a project in which a single UITableView can have hundreds of entries For testing purposes I promise. Im testing out how to work with UITableViews since Ive very new to them and Ive encountered something I dont like.p  pIf you use dequeueReusableCell in all its majesty it works just fine For example I have a button that adds 100 custom cells to a custom table view. And everything is perfectp  pThe problem is when I remove these cells I remove the information from the database, then delete the cells from the tableView and reloadData. Everything is all good EXCEPT the CustomTableViewCells are never deallocd Problem I think not because Im using the dequeue system, however since hundreds of cells are entering and exiting the table view and not a single cell is ever deallocd there is an inf build up of memory from unused TableViewCellsp  pOh NOEZp  pAnyone find a way to deal with this To somehow cap the reuse cell count so that say after 50 reuse cells they start to dealloc for memorys sakep
Negative 4528 pI have a SQL Server stored procedure that updates 10 tables, and another one that updates only one of those 10 tables. Lets call them spupdateAll and spupdateSingle respectively.

UPDATE TABLE6      SET COLUMN  VALUE     COMMIT TRAN END codepre  pI want to ensure that once spupdateAll has begun executing, spupdateSingle should return with an error. In other words, updates to individual tables should not be allowed while spUpdateAll is executing.  Is there a way to achieve this using Isolation LevelsLocking Hints Even if we set the Isolation Level to Serializable, there is a chance that spUpdateSingle executes together with spUpdateAll. For e.g. if both the transactions are run simultaneously, the following scenario could occurp  ol liTran1 begins executing spUpdateAll. Tran2 begins executing spUpdateSingle.li liTran1 gets switched before the UPDATE TABLE6 is reached. So TABLE6 is NOT LOCKED by Tran1.li liTran2 executes and commits.li liTran1 continues executionli ol  pIs this possible If so, then what would be a good approach to avoid this case Do we go for an additional table which maintains that Tran1 has begun executing something like an InUse indicator Then this table should be the first table that gets updated in spUpdateAll we set the indicator and clear it when spUpdateAll is complete. spUpdateSIngle checks for this indicator before executing the Update. Kindly help with what approach would be good in such a scenario.p  pThanks and Regardsbr Vikasp

Negative 4528 pI have a process that goes to the database and gets data. The complexities and my questions are as followp  pSome data comes from one data source and the rest come from the other data source. I was wondering once i start a process, i can create the object where in i will dump all the data and then fork  as in C language. an send each process to different data source. p  pQuestion 1  If i do something like fork, it updates both the dumping of data simultaneously right i.e. if parent process is getting data from source A and dumping in Object O, and chil process is getting from B and dumping in Object O only, the O gets populated simultaneously right It will not create two objects one with data from A and other with data from B. Also, the efficiency of this process lies in the multiprocessor systems onlyp  pQuestion 2 Is there anything like this in Javap  pThanks. p

Negative 4528 pI am trying to use the Ajax Toolkit HTMLEditor June 2012 release to improve a strictly internal application used to post news items and links mostly to internal resources. Everything works very well except that I have been unable to get the link creator to create the links to open in a new window essentially with a targetblank tag. p  pI have exposed the source code tab and tried to add the targetblank tag into the link manually, but that seems to break the HTML display, and my app shows the raw HTML code rather than the rendered HTML. If I use the link creator and dont alter the link it creates, everything works fine, except of course the link opens in the same window. Sanitizer on or off makes no difference.p  pSo far I have not been able to uncover any doucmentation on how to accomplish what I am trying to accomplish. Any ideas out therep

Could someone perhaps link me to proper referencing, assemblies, and such Google dropped those words more than once in combination with my problem.p  pUPDATE I asked a friend to test on his PC, at first, same error, but he forgot to install the XNA 4.0 redist. After that, my files were running fine on his pc. Still, theyre not working on my own nondevelopment machine, for some reason. Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, now that I know its local I can probably fix it myself. Suggestions are still welcome.p

Negative 4528 pIm not a database programmer, but I have a simple databasebacked app where I have items with tags. Each item may have multiple tags, so Im using a typical junction table like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions444251howtostorealistinadbcolumnthisa, where each row represents the fact that the item with the appropriate ID has the tag with the appropriate ID.p  pThis works very logically when I want to do something like select all items with a given tag.p  pBut, strongwhat is the typical pattern for doing codeANDcode searchesstrong That is, what if I want to find all items which have all of a certain set of tags This is such a common operation that Id think some of the intro tutorials would cover it, but I guess Im not looking in the right places.p  pThe approach I tried was to use codeINTERSECTcode, first directly and then with subqueries and codeINcode. This works, but builds up longseeming queries quickly as I add search terms. And, crucially, this approach appears to be about an order of magnitude slower than the approach of shoving all the tags as text into one tags column and using SQLites fulltext search. And, as I would expecthope, the FTS search gets faster as I add more terms, which doesnt seem to be the case with the INTERSECTS approach.p  pWhats the proper design pattern here, and whats the right way to make it snappy Im using SQLite in this case, but Im most interested in a general answer, since this emmustem be a common thing to do.p

Negative 4528 pIve just started on some raw network programming in C and have been compiling on my Raspberry Pi itself no crosscompiling. That makes everything little endian.p  pAfter constructing my IP header, I calculate the IP checksum, but it was always coming out incorrect based on an example here a hrefhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201205ipheaderchecksum relnofollowhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201205ipheaderchecksuma.p  pRevving up gdb, Ive worked my issue down to the ordering of the first 32 bits in the IP header. The example uses code0x4500003Ccode, which means version 4 code0x4code, IHL 5 code0x5code, TOS 0 code0x00code, and totlength 60 code0x003Ccode. So I set my packet up the same.p  precodestruct iphdr ip  Also some mallocing ipgtversion  4 ipgtihl  5 ipgttos  0 ipgttotlen  60 codepre  pNow in gdb, I examined the first 32 bits, expecting code0x3C000045code because of endianness, but instead I get thisp  precodegdb print ip 1  iphdr  0x11018 gdb x1xw 0x11018 0x11018        0x003c0045 codepre  pThe first 16 bits are in little endian code0x0045code but the second, containing decimal 60, seem to be in big endian code0x003Ccode p  pWhat is giving this Am I crazy Am I completely wrong about byte order inside structs Its a definite possibility p

Negative 4528 pAs per a question that I asked yesterday I was trying to find a way to dynamically create more text boxes and have those map to my views model so upon post to the server it will grab all the dynamicallyjs generated text boxes and post that to an object such as a List.p  pTo give an example of this confusing questionp  pI have a textbox that is labeled Primary Contact and the ticket creator can enter the contacts name and phone number into this box. What I want to do essentially is, switch this to three text boxes. One for Name, Email and PhoneNumber instead of one box. Then I will create some javascript that will dynamically create three more boxes to add another contact to this List collection. Then when the user submits the form to modify or create the ticket it passes this collection inside the model to the controller. However with petapoco it is a little confusing. Let me show you the controllerp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult ModifyTicketTicket model      string userString  User.Identity.Name.ReplaceONHOLD,      if ModelState.IsValid               model.CreatedDate  DateTime.Now          model.LastUpdateBy  Util.GetEmployeeIdByNameuserString          model.LastUpdate  DateTime.Now          model.IsComplete  false          model.ClientString  Util.GetClientNameByIdmodel.ClientId          model.LocationString  Util.GetLocationNameByIdmodel.LocationId           model.Update          SuccessMessage  You have successfully updated ticket number   model.TicketId   for the following client   model.ClientString  .         return RedirectToActionIndex              ErrorMessage  Woops Something went wrong, please check back in a few moments, if the problem persists please contact development.         return RedirectToActionIndex  codepre  pThe simple answer to this would be that my database model would contain a List object for this exact reason. However, I am using PetaPoco and Im not entirely sure how it would be done. I could manually add in a collection to my Database model but when I regenerate my model based on any database schema changes I will lose any changes Ive made to the file. p  pI am also using a partial class that my view uses for validation using DataAnnotations. However this class is identical to the database model it just contains DataAnnotations to provide clientside validation.p  pIf anyone understands what Im trying to accomplish I would be more than happyto provide more information to clarify any missing pieces. I just need a resolution to this as I cant find a solid way to go about resolving this issuep

Negative 4528 pSo I am trying to log into a page and get some data out of that page, but my problem is filling in these Login information.p  pstrongWhat have I triedstrong Posting data in url. By simply adding the postname en the value like so codehttpstackoverflow.compostLoginmyUsernameamppostPasswordmyPasswordcode. I sent a request with this url. It gave me an error.

It seems that it does fill in the username but not the password textboxI have written the correct postnames.p  pI also saw someone giving advice to use HtmlAgilityPack to fill in the datawhich was marked as answer. But after more searching it seemed impossible to do it with HtmlAgilityPack alone. HtmlAgilityPack is good for parsing html rather than filling it. So I came to a conclusion that I  perhaps have to use a combination of httpRequest and HtmlAgilityPack.p  pI might be wrong, so if you have a better suggestion that would help be free to point me out in the right direction.p  pBut if I am suppose to do it this way, I am not sure how to use both of them together.

I get the response from my httpWebRequest, but how do I let my Webbrowser class parse that response and afterwards let my webrequest send in the post data with username, password and of course try to submit itp  pIf you want to give answer in c i think i would be able to read it and translate it myself. p  pedit I just used fiddler and got 8 posts that are being sent.

Negative 4528 pSo Im using NSFRC to populate my UITableView. In codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode I load the information for each cell from Core Data usingp  precodeUITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiermyProto] [self configureCellcell atIndexPathindexPath] codepre  pcodeconfigureCellcode then fills 50 of the cell in by using tags, e.g.p  precodeMyEntity myEntity  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath] UILabel nameLabel  UILabel [cell viewWithTag1001] nameLabel.text  myEntity.entityName codepre  pThis continues for all the other labels and image views. While all this is happening a dictionary is populated with information from a server. The information is then used to fill in the remaining 50 of the cell, again in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode. in codewillDisplayCellcode, I do some calculations that effect minor things like the colour of text, based on calculations done on both the information saved in Core Data and information downloaded from the internet. Also in codewillDisplayCellcode I do a check to see if all the information has been downloaded from the internet. If it has, I cycle through the fetched results and changes an codeAttributecode called codesectionsSortcode based on exactly the same calculations that were done earlier. So in other words, once the loading is complete the TableView does calculations to figure out what section a specific cell should go into. NSFRC then sorts the UITableView out putting everything into correct sections.p  pI understand that this procedure is a little iffy because were setting sections after everything has been loaded. Ive done my best to handle everything appropriately, e.g. I dont allow any interaction from the user while all this is going on and I only set the section info once everything has been downloaded from the internet. However, Ive clearly not accounted for something as the NSFRC seems to be creating duplicate cells on top of each other. I can tell because on a couple of cells theres a semitransparent background which becomes doubly strong from the overlapping. They seem to come and go depending on where you are in the TableView and it causes multiple glitches. Im clearly using NSFRC wrong somewhere, but I just dont know where.p  pIf you could help me diagnose this problem Id greatly appreciate it.br Regards,br Mikep  pstrongUPDATEstrong Think Ive just found out a potential reason for this. On codeviewDidAppearcode I set the sections of every single entity. It seems that every time I save the entity NSFRC recreates the rows on screen. Is this a correct inferencep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong It seems theres something more to it than that. The last 6 cells arent even recognised by the NSFRC, even though theyre displayed. When I press edit all the apps move to the right as they should except for the last 6. Theres a whole load of weird behaviour going on. My NSLog in codewillDisplayCellcode seems to be going on and on lots of times, even when the TableView is not scrolling.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong Ok so my code to set the Section is definitely the problem.

Negative 4528 pI am writing an application in PHP, and I decided to do some testing on my own to determine how well PHP handles buffers and buffering. Specifically, I wanted to see if manually calling codeobstartcode and codeobflushcode would have a huge effect on my program.p  pI conjured up 10KB of lorem ipsum and went to work. I put a timer in PHP at the start and end of a for loop that writes the 10KB of lipsum in displaynone div blocks 100 times, for a total of 1MB of data, which I figured would be enough work that random CPU load wouldnt throw off my data too much.p  pBesides the PHP timer, I popped open Chromes developer tools F12 and recorded the time and latency field. If I have my terminology correct, the time is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and latency is just the time until the page first received data from the server.p  pSo heres the mystery When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages arep  precodePHP Time 0.00630ms Chrome Time 565.6ms Chrome Latency 28.3ms codepre  pWhen I call codeobstartcode at the very beginning, and codeobflushcode at the very endp  precodePHP Time 0.00792ms Chrome Time 540ms Chrome Latency 33ms codepre  pHOWEVER, and heres the mystery  strongwhen I call codeobstartcode and codeobflushcode at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chromereported latency spikes by 4x.strongp  precodePHP Time 0.005814ms Chrome Time 624.7ms Chrome Latency 134.9ms  codepre  pAs far as I know, the chrome latency should be strongcutstrong by 100x, since Im flushing the buffer 1100 of the way through the PHP output.

Negative 4528 pProbably basic question, but either I cannot find the answer, or I dont know what words to use to search for them.p  pI have a command line program which accepts three file names after the .exe has been called. I also have a program which is designed to run this program and test its outputs automatically. So the situation is that Im running one program and need to give it instructions on how to run the other. Through the constraints of the program I need to provide a oneline command that will execute the model. My question is How in MS DOS command prompt can I both 1  execute the program and 2 provide the three known file names all in one command.p  pThanksp  pFurther Context These two programs are not written by me, rather they are two commandline executables. The first program is a simple model which runs through the command prompt. The second is a calibration program which needs to run the model perhaps hundreds of times to calibrate certain input parameters. Thus I need to tell the calibration program how to run the model. However I need to do that in one line, or a batch file.p

Negative 4528 pI have the following 2 lines of codep  precodelstvbWerteC.Clear  if ... codepre  plstvbWerteC is a field of ListltTgt with class scope. If in the VS 2008 debugger I set a breakpoint on the if statement I would expect lstvbWerteC.Count to be 0, but instead it is 1. My class has some properties that indeed fill the list. To prevent side effects in the debugger all the properties have the attribute code[DebuggerBrowsable DebuggerBrowsableState.Never]code. Nevertheless as soon as the locals window is visible the debugger seems to execute the code filling the list. With the locals window hidden the list is always empty reaching the ifbreakpoint. Any information on debugger details concerning this type of problem would be appreciated.p

Negative 4528 pIm currently writing an app that uses ActionBar tabs for navigation. When the device is in portrait mode, there are two tabs the user can select from, each with an associated fragment. When the tablet switches to landscape, I would like these tabs to disappear because I have a two pane layout defined for landscape orientation where each pane hosts one of the fragments. I know during switches the Activity is recreated, so I can achieve this in code by only creating tabs in my OnCreate when the orientation is portrait. However, the two pane layout is only used for tablets I have it defined in layoutlargeland. For phones in landscape, the one pane layout with tabs should be used. Is there a way I can code in something like Only use tabs when the two pane layout file is being inflated i.e. tabs should only appear if the device is a tablet and in landscape mode.p

However, based on my little experiment it seems that theres this main window and the root view controllers view thats both sitting on the top of the view hierarchy, with them not having any subviewsuperview relationship Can anyone explain why my root view controllers view is not a subview of the main window Thanksp

Negative 4528 pI have a simple questionp  pI have and XSLT 2.0 transformation using SAXON. As a part of this tranformation some information is written to a file using the codexslresultdocumentcode function.p  pAfter the transformation is completed, this result file is copied to another directory and then should be deleted, but that is not always successful.p  pMy associates from across the Atlantic are respobnsible for the copy  delete mechanizm and are convinced that the XSLT transforamtion that I provide leave the result file open  locked so it cant be deleted.p  pI for one think that they somehow fail to close the file after it is copied.p  pThat being said, this raises an obvious question for mep  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs it possible that this function creates the file but leaves it open  locked after the transformation I was unable to find any relevant information on the internet.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 4528 pI have two Signals a noisy InputSignal and a filtered OutputSignal. The NoiseFilter has been implemented with a KalmanFilter.p  pPlease click on the link below to see the signalsp  pAs I see it, the Signals have two main Frequencies first of all the big waves with a period of about 75 units and the small noise with a period of 45 units. The implemented filter only reduces the noise with small wavelengths.p  pFor a presentation I want to visualize the spectrum of the two signals to show the influence of the filter on different wavelengths. p  pI tried to use the Matlab FourierFunction fft but the result did not represent the two frequencies at all. I also tried the MatlabTool sptool without convincing results. The online Tool Fourier Calculator from sooeet gave different results but not what I expected either. I tried all these tool but the spectrums always looked completely random and noisy.p  pWhat I would like to see is a spectrum composed of low frequencies and high frequencies as you see in the linked picture, but all of the algorithmstools tested looked totally differentp  pI outlined my expectations on the linked picture below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8S61f.png altthe two signals and my

Negative 4528 pstrongUpdate 3  10092013 Just tested this with codeVersion 29.0.1547.66 mcode and the problem still persists. If anyone else can test this out and let me know the results that would be great. You need an inline element such as a span with some text in, have it relatively positioned and moved by however many pixels you want from left and top. Then set up some jScript to change the current inner html of the element to something else and you should see it remain the same in the viewport but change correctly in the DOM.strongp  pstrongUpdate 2 After a bit more testing the problem seems to occur on elements that are inline such as span, or have CSS that makes them inline, but that are also relatively positioned, it seems to be this combination that is causing the issue. After posting the bug on Chromium it has been flagged as a crBlinkRendering issue which looks to be the engine that renders the DOM in the broswer viewport. I am using codeVersion 29.0.1547.57code the current version ends .66 but mine has not updated due to an error. So if youre on the latest version this issue may no longer be there.strongp  pstrongUpdate On further investigation I think the problem is with the latest Chrome build Version 29.0.1547.57 m As I tested the element in an inline fashion in IE9 and Firefox 21 and it worked fine. I have filed a bug report for this on chromiumstrongp  pIm having a problem that I have not been able to recreate with jsfiddle where I perform an ajax request, obtain some values and place them within span elements that exist within my page.p  pI have a very odd problem where the ajax request is working and bringing the values back. The values are being inserted into the span elements via jQuerys .html method and when I check the DOM using Chrome developer tools I can see the new value in the span.p  pHowever, what I see on the page doesnt reflect this, it still shows the old value. Yet if I attempt to highlight the value, it instantly changes to the correct value the value that is showing in the DOM.p  pI have even tried to update the spans value before the ajax call as the value I am using is being obtained from jQuery UIs slider widget but this still yields the same results.p  pHas anyone else come across this p  pstrongEDITstrong Here is some of the codep  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idNewLoanSliderAmount classNewLoanSliderRulesgtltdivgt ltspan idNewLoanSliderAmountDisplay classNewLoanDisplaygt600ltspangt codepre  pThe slider code.

Negative 4528 pThis is my first time asking a Python question online.  I have always been able to find answers to my questions on this site..until now.  I am trying to plot data that were developed using the Index Sequential Method, which is a technique for projecting historical data into the future.  I have 105 charts that each cover 47 years of data.  The first chart xaxis ranges from 19061952, the second 19071953, thir 19081954, etc.  My problem is when I get to 1963, which is when the 47th year reverts back to the begining 1906.  So the 1963 chart xaxis would look like this 1963, 1964, 1965,...2008,2009,2010,1906.  The 1964 chart xaxis would look like this 1964, 1965, 1967,...2009, 2010, 1906, 1907.p  pI can get the data to plot fine, I just need help figuring out how to format the xaxis to accept the unique wraparound situation when it occurs.p  pThere are three charts per page ax1, ax2, and ax3.  yearList and chartList are the x and y data, respectively.

Negative 4528 pSo, I have a two column layout and cant seem to get the height to work like I want. These both have content that needs to grow and cause the page to be scrollable  so fixed and absolute values are out. However, when using relative on these columns and their containing div and minheight percentages i.e. minimum of 100 so it always at least fills screen if no content present. However, it isnt working. The minheight isnt getting recognized and I get no height unless there is content.p  pI realize I could have a div thats in a fixed position and solely for background.

Negative 4528 pI am doing a hrefhttpprojecteuler.net relnofollowProject Eulera problems. I am currently working on the circular primes problemp  blockquote   pThe number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.p      pThere are thirteen such primes below 100 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.p      pHow many circular primes are there below one millionp blockquote  pAlthough checking if something is primes was easy for me, I could not figure out how to get all the permutations of the numbers. After a good bit of searching for tips on an algorithm to do that, I came across a website which gave code for that in Java, which I adapted to PHP below. However, before proceeding with the problem, I would really like to understand what exactly the different bits of the code are doing, especially in the for loop. What I understand of it so far is that in the for loop, it is starting with an empty prefix and then looping through the string and adding a single element from the string to the prefix, until there is only one element left in the original string, at which point, it echoes it out.

Negative 4528 pI am trying to write a managed interop library for a native C plugin standard. This native C library uses a COMcompatible interface design.

I use a 3rd party DllExport code attribute implementation  that does seem to work fine. The C test app uses LoadLibraryGetProcAddress and successfully retrieves a reference to the interface. I can set a breakpoint in my managed exported function and it gets hit as expected.p  pThen the C test app calls AddRef on the IUnknown part of the interface and it returns 2  as could be expected. Note that my managed interface definition counterpart does NOT derive from IUnknown or include these methods. I would say that means that the managed marshaling magic has stepped in and provided a CCW.p  pThen the C test app calls a simple method on the factory interface  one that just returns an int32  and that also arrives in the managed implementation breakpoint gets hit, but as that method returns it throws an AccessViolationException  somewhere in the managedunmanaged transition.p  precodeclass IPluginFactory  public FUnknown  public      removed other methods before and after this one      virtual int32 PLUGINAPI countClasses   0         codepre  pThe int32 is a define and the PLUGINAPI gets defined as stdcall  which is COM compatible as far as I can tell.p  pThe managed representation of that interface I have defined as followsp  precode[ComImport] [Guidsame guid as in C file] [InterfaceTypeComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIUnknown] public interface IPluginFactory      [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.I4]     Int32 CountClasses  codepre  pThe managed implementation of this method just returns a hard coded number 1.p  pI have tried many things so many I can not even remember them all and am currently at a loss as how to resolve this, or what the problem could be.p  pAny help is much appreciated.

Negative 4528 pstrongDisclaimerstrong Hello, This is my first post on stackoverflow, though I have lurked this invaluable site for many months.  Please let me know if I have violated any procedurescommitted noobish acts in this post.p  pstrongSummarystrong What I am attempting to do is simulate all possible strings for the Regular expression set [AZaz09] of length 5, using the map function in python.  In addition each level has an additional Regular Expression that filters out possible answers, thus the final level should only produce 1 string. I should note what I am trying to find is the 1 answer to these regular expressions.  Note this is a puzzle that originally was in javascript, so if something looks out of place I have most likely done a poor translation.p  pstrongProblemstrong I added added in print statements on level2 and it returns empty brackets.  This shouldnt be possible with what I have written.  Could someone explain what I am doing wrong  Additionally the itertools map is a computationally intense process to finding this stringmapping these regular expressions, I am open to other possible approaches.  Thank you for your time.p  p strongEditedstrong  formatting.p  precodeimport re import itertools import string for s in map.join, itertools.productstring.asciiletters  string.digits, repeat5     rexp  re.compile[AZaz09]5     matches  re.findallrexp, s LEVEL 1     if lenmatches 0             rexp  re.compile[ez09AZ][AZ]4[az]             matches  re.findallrexp, s LEVEL 2             if lenmatches 0                     rexp  re.compile[A9FbdHh5][T].2[az]                     matches  re.findallrexp, s                     printLevel 2 Match Found , matches LEVEL 3                     if lenmatches 0                             rexp  re.compileYdSeu][r][r][aeiou][pstuvwxyz]                             matches  re.findallrexp, s LEVEL 4                             if lenmatches 0                                     rexp  re.compilecabd     [AZadfqsz]2[vCXBhq][pqrst][a][passwd]                                     matches  re.findallrexp, s LEVEL 5                                     if lenmatches 0                                             rexp  re.compile.[k0pst]                                             matches  re.findallrexp, s LEVEL 6                                             if lenmatches 0                                                     rexp  re.compile[09AZ]5                                                     matches  re.findallrexp, s                                                     printPassword Found , matches printn printn printn inputPress ENTER to exit codepre

Negative 4528 pI am already familiar with the module pattern where we define a module with private state with the funcitons closure and an exposed set of public methods. However this seems to be closer to a singleton than an object.p  pHowever what if i wanted a more object orientated pattern can I use the same structure as the module pattern but dont immediately execute, Something like thisp  precodefunction MyPseudoClassconstructorArg0, constructorArg1...        var privateVar  private     var privateComplexVar  constructorArg0     var privateComplexVar1  constructorArg1      return          publicVar public Varaible,         publicMethod function              code             return privateVar  1       codepre  pNow in my code i can create instances of my pseudo class like sop  precodevar instance  MyPseudoClassp  2, q  100,x var anotherInstance  MyPseudoClassp  3, q  230,y codepre  pAs far as i can tell this seems to do what i want but i havent seen anyone using this online, are there any downsides to this approach that i should be aware ofp

The little red square player moves fine, but when I release the arrow keys, the player moves either down or to the right with a velocity of 20 arbitrary units at this point, which comes out to a few pixelssec.  I think that it has something to do with the friction, but Im not sure.p
Negative 4528 pCan someone explain this to me, In IBM info center, they mentioned that WebSphere Application Server supports IdP initiated SAML web SSO only. I have two J2EE applications, deployed on two different instances of WAS v8.5, these applications use form based authentication mechanism to authenticate users.

Negative 4528 p9 times out of 10, when I want to use the codeSubstringcode method on a string, its because I want to shave some characters off the END of the string, not the start.  While the default Substring does have support for this, it does so by taking a second parameter which is the length of the desired string, rather than the endpoint.  This means if I consistently want to shave off N characters off of a series of strings of differing length, I have to do an extra step, which can result in a good deal more code.  Take for examplep  precodeShaving the first N chars string trimmed  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.SubstringN codepre  pvs.p  precodeShaving the last N chars string trimmed  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.Substring0, foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.Length  N codepre  por maybe to save the extra function call, use a second linep  precodestring name  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name string trimmed  name.Substring0, name.Length  N codepre  pEither way, youre basically doubling the amount of code necessary to shave characters off the end of the string rather than the beginning.  My modification would be simple.  If you pass a negative N which would otherwise be meaningless, it would shave codeNcode characters off the end of the string instead of the beginning.  I can already code this up with an extension methodp  precodepublic static string MySubstringthis string str, int val      return val gt 0  str.Substringval  str.Substring0, str.Length  val  codepre  pAnd then when I want to shave off the final N chars, I just dop  precodestring trimmed  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.MySubstringN codepre  pShort and sweet, just like shaving off the beginning characters.  My question is  would it be possible to override the behavior of the default Substring function so that I can do this without having to use my own unique name for the function  Its not like it would invalidate any existing code, because previously there was no reason to pass it a negative number, and doing so would simply throw an exception and crash.  This is just one of those simple nononsense features that feels like it shouldve been part of the implementation to begin with.p

Negative 4528 pI have two push buttons and five LEDS wired up. In the circuit it the order is push button, five LEDs and push button. The order of the LEDs from left to right starting after the first push button red, green, blue, green, and red. I use the blue middle LED to differentiate the left and right sides. When the left push button is pressed, its respective green button turns on, and when the button is released, the red button comes on. The same functionality for the right side as well.

The response actually gives the weights for a neural network. Basically its an array of matrices which should remain as matrices, for the evaluation of the neural network to work. The HTTP response is as follows There are N matrices. Each one starts with an integer the matrix ID, followed by the number of rowsR and the number of columnsC in the matrix. After that, there are RC floats indicating the value stored in the matrix.

Negative 4528 pIve spent all night trying to figure out why I cant draw a series of bitmaps completely adjacent to each other with no gaps in between, using Android.p  pFor context, I am building a spectrogram application which displays a vertical bitmap for each window of audio data that comes in, providing the user with a heatmap of frequencies. At the moment Im using prerecorded audio so I can perform all my calculations before I have to display anything  I have an ArrayList of integer arrays, each of which represents one windows bitmap, which is drawn to a canvas using a timer thread.p  pI am aware that the approach below will ultimately break when the application tries to draw past the dimensions of the screen, but I am not worrying about that for now. The problem I would like to solve is that the below code results in a onepixel ish gap between the drawn bitmaps, when I would actually like them to be absolutely adjacent.p  pThis is the run method for my timer threadp  precode    public void run          Canvas c  null         try              c  sh.lockCanvasnull             synchronizedsh                  doDrawc                       finally              if cnull                  sh.unlockCanvasAndPostc                            codepre  pThis is the doDraw method which draws the bitmaps, and then skips along to the end of that drawn bitmap in order to draw the next one.

Negative 4528 pIs there a way to have user selected records remain selected as the pages are changed in the view Currently, when changing pages in the view, the selection is lost.p  pFor example, the user is looking at the Accounts entity, and wishes to select a few records from the first page of results and other records from subsequent pages.p  pI have explained that this is standard behaviour and that they should further filter their results but they are insisting that I try to find a solution.p
Negative 4528 pI want to create a container for an arbitrary type T. However, I want to add some functionality if T has a member that is header type which I also define. If T does not have that header member, then the added functionality can just be skipped.p  pThe added functionality might, for example, be to add a timestamp based on when an operation is performed. Heres pseudo code for what I wantp  precodestruct myheader    timestampt time    ... etc ...   template ltclass Tgt class mycontainer    public     void someoperationT val           condition evaluated at compile time         if T has a member of type myheader              val.header.time  getcurrenttime              ... etc ...                    other operations, agnostic to T       codepre  pof course as I have it, someoperation also has to figure out the name of the instance of myheader in class T.

Negative 4528 pSo Im trying to learn some C since I might need it for next semester of college, and I have a little problem in Visual C with precompiled headersp  pI do something like this in strongheader1.hstrongp  precodetypedef struct      int example  randstruct codepre  pThen I do this in strongheader2.hstrongp  precodeinclude header1.h codepre  pThen I do this in strongmain.cstrongp  precodeinclude header2.h  int main      randstruct s  codepre  pWhere strongheader2.hstrong is the precompiled header. Doing this results in the program not recognizing the struct and giving me errors, claiming that randstruct and s are undeclared identifiers. Doing this outside of the precompiled header simply in another header does seem to work, and doing this with function prototypes rather than typedef seems to work as well. Whats going on Is this a VC issue or am I misinterpreting somethingp  pPS I assume someones going to tell me that this is bad practice or something, and that might be, but that still leaves my curiosity. Also, the standard generated precompiled header in VC contains a stronginclude strong and for some reason I can use typedefs like strongFILEstrong normally, despite it being defined in a header file included in the precompiled header which in turn is included in my main c file.p

Negative 4528 pI am putting few icons on UITableViewCell. The number of icons can vary from 1 to 6. Icons should not have fixed X position and instead they should be dynamically placed considering the cell space. So if there are 3 icons they should look placed centric to the cell.

For instance when it is 6 icons all of them will be placed with less margins in between and when there are 3 then margin will be more and so will be the X position.p  pPlease suggest some quick way to calculate this frame.

Negative 4528 pI have a problem with detached entity passed to persistence. I thought I knew what detached entity is, but apparently this is too much for me... So Anyway I am trying to create a Person object that has an Interviewer object that has an Office object and every time I try to persist Person I get the exception Office is the detached entity in this case. Relevant code looks like thisp  precodeBefore public void setup       Person person  PersontHelper.createPerson     person.getInterviewer.setOfficeofficeDao.find1     personDao.createperson     interviewers  service.getAllInterviewers   codepre  pthe codecreatePersoncode is a static method of a helper classp  precodepublic static Person createPerson      Interviewer interviewer  Interviewer.createInterviewer     CollectionltSubjectgt skills  new HashSetltSubjectOgt        Person person  new Person      person.setInterviewerinterviewer     person.setSkillsskills      return person  codepre  pand finally codecreateInterviewercodep  precodepublic static Interviewer createInterviewer     Office office  new Office1, 1, Bristol     Interviewer interviewer  new Interviewer      interviewer.setFirstnameJohn     interviewer.setSurnameBloggs     interviewer.setEmailjohn.example.com     interviewer.setJobTitle30     interviewer.setOfficeoffice     interviewer.setInterviewsnew HashSetltInterviewgt      return interviewer  codepre  pYou might notice that helper method that creates Interviewer already sets its office, but this is used for other tests, and since the office with the same properties is stored in test database I use codeofficeDaocode to get it and set it as Interviewers office. I tried multiple combinations of what I posted here but I get no positive results so far. I dont understand why it complains about Office being detached, because it did even when I wasnt getting it from db  in other words all three object were new and they were not associated with persistence context.

Negative 4528 pIm attempting to present a UIPopoverController as the result of a UIButton tap. The UIButton is contained within a custom view thats being displayed as a UITextFields inputAccessoryView. The issue Im seeing is that when the UIPopoverController is presented the UITextField displaying the inputAccessoryView loses first responder status and, as a result, dismisses the keyboard. Is there any way to avoid this Ideally Id like the keyboard and inputAccessoryView to remain visible while the UIPopoverController is presented.p  pIve attached a screenshot below demonstrating what Im hoping to achieve right, and what Im currently seeing left.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNzZUj.png altAn image demonstrating what Im hoping to achieve right, and what Im currently seeing leftp

Negative 4528 pI have a custom board with Armada 370 SoC in which a Broadcom L2 switch is now being added via PCIE to the Soc.br The board runs on linux. I want to just initialize the L2 switch registers.br I just want very minimal access so that I can access the registers of L2 switchusing a program which uses devmem  I have the application.br Am new and I would like to know what needs to be done in PCIE drivers and menuconfig and etc.br I would be happy if someone could point to a resource which explains all this stuff from scratch because I want to learn more. Will I be able to access the registers if I just do the memory mapping correctly Do I need to do anything morep

I am using it like thisp  precode IBActionviewResultsidsender   NSEntityDescription entitydesc  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameChapters inManagedObjectContextcontext] NSFetchRequest request  [[NSFetchRequest alloc]init] [request setEntityentitydesc]  NSPredicate predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormattheverse CONTAINS[cd] ,self.textViewVerse.text] [request setPredicatepredicate]  NSError error NSArray matchingData  [context executeFetchRequestrequest erroramperror]  ifmatchingData.count lt0      self.theResults.text  NO Verse found  else      NSString theVerse  nil     NSString chapterNumber  nil     NSString chapterName  nil     NSString verseNumber  nil        for NSManagedObject obj in matchingData         theVerse  [obj valueForKeytheverse]         chapterNumber  [obj valueForKeychapternumber]         chapterName  [obj valueForKeychaptername]         verseNumber  [obj valueForKeyversenumber]           self.theResults.text  [NSString stringWithFormat Chapter Name  nnChapter Number  nnVerse Number  nnVerse ,chapterName, chapterNumber, verseNumber, theVerse]     codepre  pSo if I type in His wealth and his children will not benefit him and hit the viewResults button, it will find the verse in the database and display it with its relevant details. However, if I type in His wealth and his children will not benefit himself it will display NO Verse found. Is there a way I can view the verse without having to type in word to word  or a word which does not match and still find what I want to findp
Negative 4528 pI have this line of code that i am using in order to create the table below.p  precodeDtTemp lt Dtable[,listtemperaturepastetemperature,collapse, ,bystation.id] codepre  ptablep  precode   station.id                  temperature 1         S1     18, 20.5, 18, 18.6, 21.5 2         S2 20.1, 18.3, 16.8, 17.5, 16.4 3         S3   11, 19.1, 18.9, 17.8, 17.6 4         S4     18, 15.5, 15, 14.9, 15.8 codepre  pIn the table above, codetemperaturecode values are grouped according to codestation.idcode.p  pI am looking for to create other similar tables, strongautomaticallystrong, for every other column in my codeDtablecode dataset. That being said it is obvious that i have more than one codestation.idcode values in my original dataset codeDtablecode.p  pAssuming that a codeforcode loop might do it, or something like codeforeachcode or codeitercode how should i use them to implement it.p  pIs there a way to achieve this, giving at each codetemperaturecode column, as the example above, the relevant codeDtablecode column name, for which the table is created.p  pAppreciate any help.p

Negative 4528 pI am reading comparison between Reentrant locks and synchronization blocks in java. I am going through the various resources on internet. One disadvantage that I discovered using Reentrant locks over synchronization blocks is that in previous one, you have to explicitly use try finally block to call unlock method on the acquired lock in the finally block, as it might be possible that your critical section of code might throw exception and it can cause big trouble, if thread doesnt releases the lock, While in the latter one, JVM itself takes care of releasing the lock in case of exception. p  pI am not very much convinced with this disadvantage, because its not a big deal to use try finally block.As we have been using it for long time for exstream closing etc. Can somebody tell me some other disadvantages of Reentrant locks over synchronized blocksp

Or they could have database on a networked PC in the office server. Is that correct or are there other optionsp  pShould they use a hosted database or keep it on a office pcserverp  pCan a hosted database accessed over the web be secured from hackingp  pShould they use Microsoft Access or MySQLp  pAny advice you have on the subject is very much appreciated. p

It simulates the scenario where user can change a picture. It should replace previous one, and reload next one. I dont understand why it fails after 4 iterations. If there was enough memory to load it first time and second time, why there is not enough to reload it laterp  pThis is how I load imagesp  precode    public BitmapImage Loadstring path              var memoryStream  new MemoryStream          using var reader  new BinaryReaderFile.Openpath, FileMode.Open                      byte[] allData  reader.ReadBytesint reader.BaseStream.Length             memoryStream.WriteallData, 0, allData.Length                   memoryStream.Position  0           var bitmap  new BitmapImage         bitmap.DecodeFailed  bitmapDecodeFailed          bitmap.BeginInit         bitmap.StreamSource  memoryStream         bitmap.CacheOption  BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad         bitmap.EndInit          return bitmap            void bitmapDecodeFailedobject sender, ExceptionEventArgs e              MessageBox.Showe.ErrorException.ToString         Environment.FailFaste.ErrorException.ToString      codepre  pIt fails DecodedFailed after a few iterations it doest crashes, it just raise the event.

Lets say there is a point in large enough distance from the camera, so we can say it is placed in infinity. p  pGiven image coordinates of this point in pixels, I would like to calculate camera rotation relative to the axis that connects camera and this point so rotation is 0,0 if camera is directed at this point and it is in the optical center of the image.p  pHow can this be done using opencvp  pMany thanksp

Negative 4528 pI was wondering what the best practice was for separating different types of information within a child, in particular for purposes of applying Firebase Security Rules. My case involves keeping track of a users id their email within the child, so I can associate it with appropriate sections of our DB and restrict access as needed using Firebase Security Rules, like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVIE0z.png altenter image description herep  pIn the case above, during certain processes our application needs to enumerate the children of the key ending in xJEm. However, enumerating accurately requires the application to ignore the owner child, in order for the information to be parsed correctly. This pattern repeats throughout other children in the Firebase, and requires specific ignore upkeep in our code. So my question is whether its better to p  ol likeep the information mixed like it is above and have conditions checking for the owner child in my code li liseparate all the information into its own data child, making it easier to parse, but introducing another level of complexity and possibly slowing down queries, or li lisome other solution for associating a users email with each relevant piece of the DB, in order to apply Firebase Security Rulesli ol  pThanksp

But I kind of have the impression codemake.linkcode does not operate like that.  Perhaps I am wrong.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt seems like this method should work.  Although, it might require limiting the range of possible values searched to avoid multiple solutions.p  pFirst, regarding the link function codesinlin.pred  12code, note that codesinlin.predcode is bounded between code1code and code1code inclusive.  Therefore, codesinlin.pred  1code is bounded between code0code and code2code inclusive.  Therefore, codesinlin.pred  12code is bounded between code0code and code1code inclusive.

I have not tried adding a covariate.  Maybe my suspicion of how the SIN link is used in the other software and my attempt to use it here are both completely wrong.  I can find nothing on the internet about the SIN link.p  pstrongEDIT  August 25, 2014strongp  pI have been seeking statistical help with this question on Cross Validatedp  pa hrefhttpstats.stackexchange.comquestions113043sinlinkwithlogisticregressionhttpstats.stackexchange.comquestions113043sinlinkwithlogisticregressionap  pas well as programming help on Stack Overflow.p  pThe inverse of the SIN link, I believe, is codelin.pred lt asin2y  1code This returns the correct linear predictor as long as the linear predictor, codezcode, falls in the range code1 lt z lt 1code.  This inverse function might be acceptable under the conditions that there is only one nonzero element per row in the design matrix, i.e., dummy variables are allowed with no intercept to compare groups e.g., probability of success for Groups A vs B.p  pThe above proposed inverse link might solve the problem of the inverse and constraints on the search space in which case the next step is to incorporate this inverse link into a userspecified link function in glm in R along with any additional required information to estimate proportions.p  pAs such, the question may once again be focused on programming, rather than statistics.p  pstrongEDIT  August 26, 2014strongp  pI have not yet been able to implement the SIN link into glm in R, but I did manage to write R code for the likelihood function with the logit link and solve with optim.

I copied the GNU word count programp  precodecp usrbinwc usrbinwcx codepre  pand then I ran wc on a text file on my desktop and got the following, as expectedp  precode53 79 907 homemeDesktopmytextfile.txt codepre  pso far nothing out of the ordinary. I then delete remove wcp  precoderm usrbinwc codepre  pand the command returns with no terminal output. So it has been removed.p  pNow at this point I should note that the PATH in this terminal isp  precodeusrlocalsbinusrlocalbinusrsbinusrbinusrbinsbinbinusrgames [ETC] codepre  pNow when I run the same commandp  precodewc homemeDesktopmytextfile.txt codepre  pI get backp  precodebash usrbinwc No such file or directory codepre  pNow, obviously it should not be able to find the wc binary as I deleted it. That is as expected. But the curious thing is that bash appears to have remembered where on the PATH it last found the program as it has indicated that it cant find it in usrbinp  pIs this an actual feature of bash Is there a cache that, once it has searched the PATH for the binary once, it knows to return to that place for future requests of that binaryp  pThanks for helping to clear this upp

However, this has a lot of stuff I dont want and way more Views than Ill ever need. I dont want to have to create a new login page or duplicate my active directory auth code for every new MVC application that I create.p  pThanks for any guidance on this.p

Our game uses SDL2 for OpenGL context management. I wasted 2 days of debugging and couldnt find anything wrong with our code or any indication why no rendering is taking place at all. The same build files and libraries are used in Linux and the game works perfectly there.

Im pretty sure coordination of my iPhone is ENU  x positive points to East, y positive points to North, z positive points to observer. I have tried different combinations of swapping and inverting axis none of them works perfect. gy, gx, gz, ay, ax, az gives the best result, though its still very unstablep  pThe second question is what QuaternionToEuler convention should I use, Im not very familiar with this topic but I guess different QuaternionToEuler convention is according to different coordination system. Madgwick gives QuaternionToEuler function in his paper but it did not work for me. I think it probably happen to be a wrong coordination system in my case.p  pHope Ive clearly explained my questions and I really appreciate for any inputp  pthanks,p  pDihanp

Negative 4528 pId like to record some mouse interaction with a web page, or more specifically, with a canvas element on that web page. So interacting with various web elements will be of little use, and instead interacting with the canvas with fine position control is essential.p  pFor a while I was looking at the a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsMouse.html relnofollowcodeMousecodea interface. I was somewhat surprised that I could provide offset for movement, but not for codemouseDowncode and codemouseUpcode. It also took me a while to figure out that I can probably turn a a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumWebElement.html relnofollowcodeWebElementcodea into a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsinternalCoordinates.html relnofollowcodeCoordinatescodea by casting it to the a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminternalLocatable.html relnofollowcodeLocatablecodea interface first.p  pBut codeLocatablecode and codeCoordinatescode are in a package called codeinternalcode. Eventually with the help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq97357191468366this questiona I learned about a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsActions.html relnofollowcodeActionscodea. Its documentation statesp  blockquote   pThe userfacing API for emulating complex user gestures. Use this class rather than using the Keyboard or Mouse directly.p blockquote  pSo it seems that I should be using this. Expressing my movement in that context seems easy enough. But what has me worried is timing. Id like to move objects approximately at the same speed I used when recording. Im not aiming to exactly reproduce timing, but some mouse actions will trigger computations in a timer step, so the interaction between mouse events and timer should be simulated in a natural fashion.p  pI see no codewaitcode or codesleepcode method in codeActionscode. What I do see is a codepausecode method, but that has been deprecated. The deprecation message readsp  blockquote   pPause is considered to be a bad design practice.p blockquote  pThe a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumsourcedetailra7d53122fd86ea268078fbd125bcaa45ab124f57 relnofollowcommita adding that deprecation has no more detail either.p  ul liWhy is codepausecode considered bad designli liCan I expect drivers to support this command despite the deprecationli liDo I have to fear that this command will vanish soonli liHow else should I implement timing of mouse movementli ul  pThere appears to be plenty of places where some form of waiting can be realized. a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumsupportuiWebDriverWait.html relnofollowcodeWebDriverWaitcodea and a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumWebDriver.Timeouts.html relnofollowcodeWebDriver.Timeoutscodea seem the most likely candidates. But would it really be preferable to perform codeActionscode consisting of a single mouse move, and interleave them with waits Particularly if I might be remote controlling some machine over a slow link Interleaving codepausecode statements in a long codeActionscode sequence seemed so much more reasonable to me.p  pemEdit 1em Looking at a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumsourcebrowsejavaclientsrcorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsPauseAction.java relnofollowthe sourcesa I see that codeActions.pausecode is simply implemented using codeThread.sleepcode. So the delay is only local, and network latency over a bad link might severely distort timing. I also found two bug reports regarding codeActions.pausecode, a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumissuesdetailid7424 relnofollowonea requesting that it not be deprecated and a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumissuesdetailid7646 relnofollowanothera reuqesting an alternative. The latter comes with a proofofconcept implementation building on codeWebDriverWaitcode. But looking at that, it bases its timing on codeClockcode and the only implementation of that interface is codeSystemClockcode so it appears that again all timing is controlled clientside. What wed need would be some onthewire command for a serverside delay, I think.p

Negative 4528 pIm currently learning C coming from a java background. To get my feet wet I decided to make a simple SMTP mail application. And I learned very quickly that C offers support for both Synchronous and Asynchronous sockets. p  pFrom what I can see, there is no real advantage to using a synchronous socket vs an asynchronous since the latter doesnt block and therefor doesnt require you to create a new thread each time. There also doesnt seem to be a noticeable overhead to using one or the other. p  pSo my question is this, is there an advantage to using a synchronous socket or is it better to just stick with asynchronous in most casesp

This works just fine in Chrome version right out of the repos, but it does not work in Firefox and IE10 and IE11. Actually, codecssTextcode is a property on the returned object, its just an empty string.p  pIt may not work in older versions of IE but I havent tested it in those versions. I cannot seem to find any reference to this specifically not working in recent versions of IE. Actually a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryiems533698vvs.85.aspx relnofollowMicrosofts documentationa has led me to believe that it SHOULD work when in fact it does not Sets or retrieves the persisted representation of the style rule.

To clarify, it appears using the codestyle.cssTextcode property of an element in IE retrieves a list of styles applied to an element via stylesheets, style tags, and inline style rules, but NOT styles which were applied programmatically via scripts. This may be by design and as intended, but How can I replicate the behavior seen when using codecssTextcode from a CSSStyleDeclaration object in Chrome as returned by codegetComputedStylecode, but in Internet Explorer and Firefoxp

But this way its not clear that emActivityem should implement this interface until codeClassCastExceptioncode will be thrown in runtime. And it also makes strong dependence  to use it somewhere outside emActivityem I should implement the codeCallbackcode interface in emActivityem. So I cannot use it in codeFragmentcodes independent of emhostem emActivitiesem codeprepareAlertDialogFragment.showgetActivity.getSupportFragmentManager, tagcodep

Negative 4528 pWhen using codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode, the dropdown suggestion list appears with the software keyboard still  visible. This makes sense, as it is often a lot more efficient to type ensuing characters to narrow the list. p  pBut if the user wants to navigate the suggestion list, it becomes extremely tedious with the software keyboard still up this is even more of a problem when the device is in landscape orientation. Navigating the list is a lot easier without the keyboard hogging the screen space. Unfortunately, the default behaviour removes the list first when you press the back key even though in the software versions of the back key it is showing the image that says pressing this will hide the keyboard.p  pHeres a barebones example that demonstrates what Im talking aboutp  precodepublic class Main2 extends Activity      private static final String[] items               One,             Two,             Three,             Four,             Five           Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState          AutoCompleteTextView actv  new AutoCompleteTextViewthis         actv.setLayoutParamsnew LinearLayout.LayoutParamsViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT         actv.setAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, android.R.layout.simplelistitem1, items         actv.setThreshold1          LinearLayout ll  new LinearLayoutthis         ll.setOrientationLinearLayout.VERTICAL         ll.addViewactv          setContentViewll       codepre  pBesides the fact that this is unintuitive the back key hint is suggesting that the back press will be sent to the keyboard, it makes navigating codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode suggestions extremely tiresome.p  pWhat is the strongleaststrong intrusive way e.g. catching the back in on codeonBackPressedcode in every activity and routing it accordingly would definitely not be ideal  to make the first back press hide the keyboard, and the second remove the suggestion listp

Negative 4528 pGood day, Iv implemented a REST service. In the URL of resource endpoint I use IDs which are primary keys of tables of the database. For example codehttphostmyappitemsitem4code. Iv learned using the database ID in the URL is a bad practice and I should use UUID instead. On the other hand Iv learned that using UUIDs in indexes is a performance issue if theres many records in the database because they are not sequential 1,2,3,.... So Iv got an idea to encrypt the database ID. This is how it could workp  precode1 Client POSTs an item to httphostmyappitems. 2 The backend creates a new item in the database. 3 Autoincremented ID 4 is generated by the database. 4 The backend encrypts the ID 4 to fa4ce3178a045b2a using a cipher key and returns encrypted ID of a created resource. codepre  pAnd thenp  precode5 Client sends a request to GET httpmyappitemsitemfa4ce3178a045b2a. 6 The backend decrypts fa4ce3178a045b2a to 4 using an cipher key. 7 The backend fetches item with primary key 4 and sends it to the client. codepre  pWhat are the cons of such solution Will the encryptiondecryption will be fast enough so that its not worse then using UUID And what encryption algorithm should I use so that it is fast and doesnt consume much resources Could someone more experienced advise or recommend a better solution Thank you in advance.

Negative 4528 pI am looking for a way to utilize the motherboard CD Audio In analog audio input in my VB.Net application in Windows 7.  I have a system which needs to use audio connected to that input not actually CD audio, but from a custom piece of audio hardware inside the PC box. I am porting my old XP application wherein this input was easily accessed via the XP Mixer. In win7, this input does not show up when enumerating the input devices.  Ive searched the web for weeks and can only find info on reading audio as data from the CD, which does not help.  It looks like MS may have removed this input from the mixer in Win7 for DRM reasons, but the hardware still exists on many modern motherboards, including the one Im using in my systems.  Any ideas greatly appreciated p

Negative 4528 pBecause the information in each tab may not display depending on screen size, i have added a scrollview. The list view displays the information from the database alright but then it does not spread across the screen. It takes only a small portion of the screen and I can only scroll in that small portion.

Ive tried naming the parameter for UploadAwardDocument to codefilescode, per the KendoUI MVC3 convention, but that still returned null.p  pAny mispellings are simply a problem with having to retype the code on my internetconnected laptop everything except the codefiAwardUploadercode parameter being null works correctly.  Due to legacy coding issues, the app cannot post back herethe upload has to be async.  Due to budget constraints and my personal preference, we will not be moving to the KendoUI MVC3 Professional Suite.p  pIm stuck, and exactly 16 hours from having to ditch the KendoUI solution and find another async upload tool.p

Negative 4528 pIm working on an iOS app, uploading videos from the Camera Roll, using NSURLSession with a background configuration. The user can queue up multiple videos for upload the queue is executed serially. p  pA single upload consists ofp  ol liGetting an AVURLAsset reference to the PHAsset using PHImageManagers coderequestAVAssetForVideocode method. li liCopying the resource to a temp directory because you cannot upload straight from the AVURLAssets URL.li liUploading the resource using an NSURLSessionUploadTaskli ol  pI can queue up multiple videos and the process works well in the foreground. They complete one after another. p  pBut if I queue up several videos and then background the app. As soon as execution reaches the codecopyItemAtURLtoURLerrorcode stage it stalls until I foreground the app again. I know this because Im posting debug statements in local notifications, visible on the lock screen. p  pIs it possible to use codecopyItemAtURLtoURLerrorcode when the app is backgrounded p  pIf not, is it possible to use an AVAssetExportSession insteadp  pemEdit 1em Ive tested this while connected to the debugger and while not, the app never executes the copy command. But does so only when the app is foregrounded again. p  pemEdit 2em To clarify, execution stalls at the copy command. It doesnt yield an error and continue execution. And implementing the codefileManagershouldCopyItemAtURLtoURLcode delegate method doesnt change things. The docs for that method also say p  blockquote   pPrior to copying each item, the file manager asks its delegate if it   should actually do so. It does this by calling the   fileManagershouldCopyItemAtURLtoURL method if that method is not   implemented or the process is running in OS X 10.5 or earlier it   calls the fileManagershouldCopyItemAtPathtoPath method instead. If   the delegate method returns YES, or if the delegate does not implement   the appropriate methods, the file manager proceeds to copy the file or   directory.p blockquote
Negative 4528 pAs part of a larger simulation program the context of which Im happy to share, but which is not relevant to the question, I have run across the following problem and am looking for a good algorithm.p  pThe problem You are given a floatingpoint array f of length n with elements f1, ..., fn specifying a point in ndimensional space.  It can fairly be assumed that the sum of f is 0.0 subject to floating point precision.p  pThe sought Find the integer array i of length n with elements i1, ..., in, specifying a grid point in ndimensional space, such that the sum of i is exactly 0 and df,i, a suitable measure of distance between f and i, is minimized.p  pAs for the suitable measure, I think the best one would be the one that minimizes the relative error i.e., sum over j of ijfj12, but minimizing ordinary euclidean distance i.e., sum over j of ijfj2 might work too.p  pThe best algorithm which readily occurs to me is to guess a suitable point on the i grid with sum 0 and then repeatedly switching to the neighboring grid points with sum 0 with the minimal distance until all neighbors have a larger distance.  Given the concavity of the distance function, this should converge on the solution.p  pBut that algorithm seems clunky.  Can anyone do betterp  pThere is a related discussion at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions792460howtoroundfloatstointegerswhilepreservingtheirsumHow to round floats to integers while preserving their suma but it does not reach the optimality point Im looking for.p  pADDENDUM ON CONTEXT In case it is of interest and also because I thought it was kind of cool, let me specify the context in which the problem arose.p  pThe problem occurs as part of a trading simulation which is part of a yet larger simulation.  At each location, agents offer to trade a number of commodities.  As each location and commodity is handled separately, we can focus on one location and commodity and deal with them seriatim.p  pEach agent j has an amount of currency cj and a quantity of the commodity qj, which are and have to remain integral.  Each agent also specifies a realvalued, continuous, nonnegative, nonmonotonically decreasing demand function djp which essentially represents how many units of the commodity the agent would like to own at any given price.p  pTrades are executed in the following steps.p  ol liFor each agent j calculate a budgetconstrained demand function bjp  min djp, qj  cjpli liDefine total quantity qtot sum over j of qj and total budgetconstrained demand function btotp sum over j of bjp.li liFind the equilibrium price peq for which btotpeq  qtot, using Newtons method.  If there is no equilibrium price, return.li liDefine the traded quantity for each agent fj as bjpeqqj which is positive for net purchases and negative for net sales.li liAgents for which fj is very small e.g., less than 110 are removed from the calculationli liEach qj should be adjusted to qjfj and each cj to cjpeqfjli liIt as this point that the problem arises. fj and peq are floating point, but the qj and cj need to remain integral.  To avoid creating or destroying currency or commodities, the arrays fj and peqfj need to be consistently rounded to integralsli ol

Negative 4528 pIm having an odd issue with a POST form in Laravel. p  pWhen sending a post request, my Laravel throws an MethodNotAllowedHttpException. Upon looking into the errormessage, I can see that Laravel thinks that my request is a GET request, which it is not. p  pWhen looking at both POST data and GET data of the errorpage, Laravel seems to think that they are both empty.  This leaves me a bit confused, since it seems that some kind of redirect is going on, the HTTPREFERER on the error is the page Im posting from. p  pIve had this issue before, where making a named route solved my problem, but Im making a simple CMS, so templates for a form is used, and its not possible for me to use named routes, without allowing the user to use Blade syntax which is a bad idea. p  pMy route is as follows Simplified to a Hello world p  precodeRoutepostsignupadd, function     echo Hello world   codepre  pa hrefhttppastebin.comEsAeyHFx relnofollowhttppastebin.comEsAeyHFxa lt Full routes.phpp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comByHdUFcK relnofollowhttppastebin.comByHdUFcKa lt My form. Nothing fancy, only plain textradiobuttons input. No html or anything special. p  pThe even more strange part on this, is that I have another form login form that does not result in this behavior. p  pI have been looking at several other questions on StackOverflow, but they all seem to end up being a mistake of sending POST data to a GET route. This is not my case. p  pIf I change the route from POST to GET, it works fine. p  pIve also tried to change the action of the form to GET and use the hidden field method and set it post  No success. p  pCan someone tell me what is going on with this Exception and how to fix itp  pADDED  After some experimenting, I found out that when using 3rd party software Like chrome extension Postman and sending a POST request to the page, it works as inteded. p
Negative 4528 pstrongThe history of this problem isstrongp  pI have millions of files and directories on a NAS system. I found a count of 1,095,601 empty 0 byte files. These files used to have data but were destroyed by a predecessor not using the correct toolsets to migrate data between an XSAN and this Isilon NAS.p  pThe files were media production data, like fonts, pdfs and image files. They are no longer useful beyond the history of their existence. Before I proceed to delete them, the production users need a record of which files used to exist, so when they browse a project folder, they can use the unaffected files but then refer to a text file in the same directory which records which files used to also be there and thus provide reason as to why certain reference files are broken.p  pSo how do I find files across multiple directories and delete them but first output their filename to a text file which would be saved to each relevant path locationp  pI am thinking along the lines of p  precodefor file in find . type f size 0 do     echo file gtgt PATHTOFOUNDFILEPARENTDIRdeletedFiles.txt print0      xargs 0 rm  done codepre

POI allows you to get the column default style, but theres no equivalent as near as I can tell to getting a default type. Im getting a String from my user interface and I dont know how to set the cell type. If the string is a double, then fine, its NUMERIC. But if the String specifies a date, how would I best detect it so that it is also set to NUMERIC There are some many formatting types for a date that it is impractical to detect the type from the cell style format. Does POI support a way to parse based on a formatp

Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user          file needs this password xxj31ZMTZzkVA.        o ExportCertData          This exports two additional environment variables SSLCLIENTCERT and          SSLSERVERCERT. These contain the PEMencoded certificates of the          server always existing and the client only existing when client          authentication is used. This can be used to import the certificates          into CGI scripts.        o StdEnvVars          This exports the standard SSLTLS related SSL environment variables.          Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,          because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually          useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the          exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.        o StrictRequire          This denies access when SSLRequireSSL or SSLRequire applied even          under a Satisfy any situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied          and no other module can change it.        o OptRenegotiate          This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL          directives are used in perdirectory context.

When you need a different shutdown        approach you can use one of the following variables        o ssluncleanshutdown          This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no          SSL close notify alert is sent or allowed to be received.  This violates          the SSLTLS standard but is needed for some braindead browsers. Use          this when you receive IO errors because of the standard approach where          modssl sends the close notify alert.        o sslaccurateshutdown          This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a          SSL close notify alert is send and modssl waits for the close notify          alert of the client. This is 100 SSLTLS standard compliant, but in          practice often causes hanging connections with braindead browsers. Use          this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation          works correctly.         Notice Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP        keepalive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable        keepalive for those clients, too. Use variable nokeepalive for this.        Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP1.0 to workaround        their broken HTTP1.1 implementation. Use variables downgrade1.0 and        forceresponse1.0 for this.

Negative 4528 pWe are having trouble figuring out how to call asmx web services from crossplatform Xamarin code. There seem to be four options.

We got some incorrect behaviour, which we put down to the fact that WCF on Xamarin is a hrefhttpdeveloper.xamarin.comguidescrossplatformapplicationfundamentalswebservices relnofollowpreviewa only. The generated XML was different from that produced by the same code running under other WCF implementations, and was not accepted by the target server. Furthermore, WCF is not supported in PCL profiles that target Windows Phone 8.1. li liWe looked up whether we could drop the use of WCF, and use strongold school ASMXtype proxiesstrong from a PCL. There seems to be an enormous amount of conflicting information on whether this is even possible. For instance a hrefhttpforums.xamarin.comdiscussion11946pclwithwebservicesgettingerrorareyoumissingsystemwebassemblyreference relnofollowherea, a Xamarin employee writes that its not supported to use ASMXstyle web references in PCL, and that you have to use WCF. But weve already established  that using WCF could be a bad idea see 1.li liShould we just strongroll our own calling codestrong, based just on HttpClientli liOR should we drop all use of PCLs, and stronguse Shared Libraries insteadstrongli ol  pMany thanks for any help or experiences you can share.p

Negative 4528 pI am new to verilog so please be easy.p  pAre assertions available in verilog  Or are they a part of systemVerilog p  pLike most new comers, I have grabbed a book on verilog and it includes a chapter on verification  which has assertions in it  more than 2 dozens of them . It also mentions OVL which I guess has some sort of header files  or library containing these definitions . p  pBut google primarily displays results for assertions in systemVerilog not verilog. Add more to that, I am using Xilinx ISE 14.7 and Spartan 3A starter board as device . Xilinx Website mentions systemVerilog is supported only by Vivado design suite , but this suite does not support Spartan 3A board I dont know systemVerilog either . p  pSo given all this, I am a little confused. How do I learn assert based verification in verilog . Is such thing even there in verilog  I assume its there in verilog because its a verilog book  . Is there some way I can do this is xilinx ise 14.7  I also have access to modelsim student edition for simulation, if that can help.p

Negative 4528 pI have a school assignment to implement a hashset and a hashmap, I am given a main.cpp that has code to test these classes inserts, deletes, searches, prints, etc. I am also given a base hashtable class that is a templated class, and just told to make the hashset and hashmap work based on the testing code with new classes of their own. p  pWithout more specific details, I assume I am supposed to implement the set and map based on the hashtable, which the teacher said the project could be completed in 40 lines of code wat between the two new classes...but I cant even get the hashset class to inherit the hashtable since its a template. I can get it compiling ok without making the hashset class a template, until I instantiate it, since the testing code is passing it a template type in the declaration. But if I try to make the class a template type itself to compensate for this, everything breaks and I cant track down the source of the error.

Firstly, I am using clojure which is not OO. Also dont want to fall into the Liskov Substitution trap.p  pSo, as a newbie to Datomic, is there a way to dynamically change the schema so that an attributes cardinality is modified based on another attribute value. In this case, if Periodic is false we dont need to have PeriodStart, PeriodEnd. If Periodic is true then we need to enforce having values for these attributes.p  pMy gut says, this is not possible. If not, how can I enforce this in the DB It appears to me that if I have to explicitly validate the transaction before submitting it to the transactor then I am really just defining a schema outside of the constraints of Datomic which doesnt appear to be wise, given that many microsystems will be writingreading from the DB and coordinating humans to write correct code is difficult  p  pAny help on how to overcome this challenge very gratefully received.p

However it doesnt actually submit the form I need the form to be submitted, because the content I am loading into Div is dependent on POST[v] being set.

Depending on which button was clicked, specific content will be loaded.p  pIf I use ajax and prevent default, the above will never run because the form is being prevented from submitted.

Negative 4528 pI spend a lot more time in the iOS space than Android, so apologies if this is an obvious question ...p  pWe have an enterprise Android app that we need to roll out to a lot of locations nationwide.  Ideally, wed like to be able to install our current app and future apps without involving the onsite staff.  Is there a way to do remote installs for Android devices  We could do the installs ourselves then ship out the devices, but there will be additional apps added to this project over the next year, so we dont want to keep shipping the devices back and forth.  And due to the nature of the industry and end users, it would be best if we could control install centrally instead of relying on those remote staff to do so.  And we are looking at 1000 devices, if that affects the answer.p  pAll the solutions Ive found so far are more for individual users, not for a large setup like ours.  p

Negative 4528 pI have this codeContainercode class with begin and end functions for use with c11 foreach loopsp  precodeclass Element      content doesnt matter   class Container      Element elements     int size       constructor, destructor, operators, methods, etc..

Incrementing a pointer increments by the base type size which is codesizeofElementcode for incrementing codeElementcode and codesizeofElementcode for incrementing codeElementcode.  p  pSo the prefix codeoperatorcode will offset the pointer by a false value and things get crappy. Any ideas how to get this to workp

Negative 4528 pFirst off, apologies for a long post. Its really more simple than it looks p  pIm trying to do something that I think is conceptually simple, and I believe Im most of the way there, but theres one last part that I cant implement without errors that I cant figure out how to fix.p  pI have three related tables.p  pstrongOrdersstrongbr Each row is an Order with a unique ID, there will never be duplicates.p  precode  OrderID  Name       1        Order 1   2        Order 2   3        Order 3   codepre  pstrongOrder Detailsstrongbr Relational table where each row is a product line on an order.p  precode  OrderID  ProductID    1        a           2        b           2        c           3        a           3        b           3        b           codepre  pAs you can see some orders have just one product 1, some will have multiple products 2 and some will have duplicate products 3.p  pstrongProductsstrongbr Each row is a product with a unique ID, there will never be duplicates.p  precode  ProductID  Description    a          Chicken       b          Fish          c          Beef          codepre  pI want to return all rows from the Orders table and conditionally return some information about the related Products in one column.p  pThe condition is that I look at how many codeDISTINCTcode products each Order has. If its just 1 then I want to return the Product Description value. If its more than 1 then I want to return some placeholder text such as Multi.p  pI think that I need to use codeCASEcode to get this working, but I cant figure it out.p  pI can count the unique products successfully like thisp  precodeSELECT      o.Name    ,COUNTDISTINCT d.ProductId as Unique Products FROM Orders o  LEFT JOIN OrderDetails d ON o.OrderID  d.OrderID LEFT JOIN Products p on d.ProductId  p.ProductId  GROUP BY o.Name ORDER BY o.Name DESC  GO codepre  pResults are like thisp  precode  Name     Unique Products    Order 1  1                 Order 2  2                 Order 3  2                 codepre  pWhat I want is thisp  precode  Name     Unique Products    Order 1  Chicken           Order 2  Multi             Order 3  Multi             codepre  pI have been trying to use codeCASEcode which I believe Ive gotten correctp  precodeCASE WHEN COUNTDISTINCT d.ProductId gt 1 THEN Multi ELSE p.Description END AS Products codepre  pHowever unless I add p.Description to codeGROUP BYcode then I get the error which I understandp  blockquote   pColumn Product.Description is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.p blockquote  pBut if I do add it the results arent what I want, for examplep  precode  Name     Products    Order 1  Chicken    Order 2  Fish       Order 2  Beef       Order 3  Chicken    Order 3  Fish       Order 3  Fish       codepre  pWhen it should just say Order 2  Multi on one row for example. strongThis is the bit I dont understandstrong.p  pIf can get some help on this bit alone it would solve my problem and Id accept the answer. However...p  pstrongBonus Roundstrongp  pThe above is fine and all, but if this bit is possible Id accept this as an answer above the others.p  pCan I concatenate the product names Ive been looking at codeCOALESCEcode and codeFOR XML PATHcode but I cant wrap my head around them at all so I dont even have any code to show.p  pResults would look something like thisp  precode  Name     Products        Order 1  Chicken        Order 2  FishBeef      Order 3  ChickenFish   codepre  pIf youve made it this far I commend you Thanksp
Negative 4528 pI am writing a serial port communication application in Java using a library called jSSC javasimpleserialconnector with an external device.p  pAfter sending a message and waiting for its return, I have a timeout that will abort the reading if there is no reading after certain time 2 second. If that happens, the port is closed and reopened for further message exchange.p  pWhat I noticed is that, if for some reason, the timeout happens, and the port is closed and reopened, further message reading from the port will be interfered i.e., the message read cannot be decoded. It looks as if previous message from the device is still on the line and continue to come in for the next reading operation. p  pIm not very familiar with serial port so Im not totally sure if this is the case. I would think but may well be wrong the previous message sending by the other part is discarded after I close the connection from my side as in a TCPIP communication. p  pCan anyone shed some light on this topic as to how exactly the serial port behave after closereopen Is it possible for the other part a device to continue sending the old message even after I close the connection in the applicationp
