Positive 1834 pI am trying to an existing game engine, and something I want to change is for the game to only render part of the map that is seen on screen, rather than rendering the entire map.  I have made a tiny bit of success so far, but it doesnt work correctly and I need some advice.p  pFirst, here is the original code for rendering the map in the game loopp  precode    public void renderJFrame frame, Graphics2D g2d, int xx, int yy          int xt  xx         forint y  0 y lt mapHeight y              forint x  0 x lt mapWidth x                  mapTiles[x  y  mapWidth].renderTilexx, yy, g2d, frame                 xx  xx  spriteSize                          xx  xt             yy  yy  spriteSize               codepre  pThe xx and yy passed are the camera coordinates. They change as the player moves its a free roam game, and the player stays on the center of the screen as the camera moves. The entire map is drawn tile by tile. Also, the x  y  mapWidth is a 1 dimensional array, the original creator of the code claims that using a 1 dimensional array over a 2 dimensional one increases the FPS in the end  I dont know if there is any validity to the claim, but for now Im leaving it alone.p  pI created a method to get the current tile the player is standing on, and doing so tried to create the code to only draw tiles that are visible on screen. My code looks like thisp  precodepublic void renderJFrame frame, Graphics2D g2d, int mapX, int mapY, int currentTileX, int currentTileY      int startX  mapX         int startY  mapY         forint y  currentTileY  5 y lt currentTileY  6 y              forint x  currentTileX  9 x lt currentTileX  10 x                  if x gt 0 ampamp y gt 0 ampamp x lt mapWidth ampamp y lt mapHeight                                      mapTiles[x  y  mapWidth].renderTilestartX, startY, g2d, frame                                  startX  64                             startX  mapX             startY  64          codepre  pIn this code, I tried only drawing the part of the map thats visible on screen based on the camera. The screen width holds 19 tiles, and the height holds 11 tiles, and that part does work. However, when moving which changes the mapxmapy, the next tile in the series will not show even though it is technically viewable on screen. If the current tile changes, the entire map seems to skip forward, rather than making a smooth transition, and the player is sent to the next tile after the one the player should have moved to.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how to fix my codea different solution to making this work p

Positive 1834 pI am building a GUI application to monitorcontrol remote embedded client devices.

Negative 1834 pI want to calculate a convex hull around a shape in a binary NxM matrix. The convex hull algorithm expects a list of coordinates, so I take numpy.argwhereim to have all shape point coordinates. However, most of those points are not contributing to the convex hull they lie on the inside of the shape. Because convex hull computation time is at least proportional to the number of points that it gets as input, I devised an idea to filter the plethora of useless points on beforehand and only pass those that span the outline. The idea is quite simple, that for each row in the binary NxM matrix I take only the minimal and maximal indices. So for examplep  precodeim  np.array[[1,1,1,0],               [1,0,1,1],               [1,1,0,1],               [0,0,0,0],               [0,1,1,1]], dtypenp.bool outline  somefuncim codepre  pThen outline should read in tuples or as a 5x2 numpy array, I dont mindp  precode[0,0,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,0,2,3,4,1,4,3] codepre  pAny convex hull tight around this shape im, must a subset of these points outline. In other words, if somefunc is efficient in filtering the inside points then it saves time for the convex hull computation.p  pI have code that does the above trick, but I am hoping someone has a more clever read faster approach since I need to run it many many times. The code I have isp  precode I have a 2D binary field. random for the purpose of demonstration. import numpy as np im  np.random.random320,360 gt 0.9   This is my algorithm so far. Notice that coords is sorted. coords  np.argwhereim left  np.rollcoords[,0], 1, axis0  coords[,0] outline  np.vstack[coords[left], coords[left[1]], coords[1]] codepre  pAnother idea I had was to use Pythons reduce so Id need to run over the list of coords only once. But I have difficulty finding a good reducing function.p  pAny help would greatly be appreciatedp  pstrongeditstrongp  pIn the meanwhile I have found a faster way to go from codeimcode directly to codeoutlinecode.

Negative 1834 pI want to rewrite certain parts of the LINQ expression just before execution. And Im having problems injecting my rewriter in the correct place at all actually.p  pLooking at the Entity Framework source in reflector it in the end comes down to the codeIQueryProvider.Executecode which in EF is coupled to the expression by the codeObjectContextcode offering the codeinternal IQueryProvider Provider  get code property.p  pSo I created a a wrapper class implementing codeIQueryProvidercode to do the Expression rewriting when the Execute gets called and then pass it to the original Provider. p  pProblem is, the field behind codeProvidercode is codeprivate ObjectQueryProvider queryProvidercode. This codeObjectQueryProvidercode  is an stronginternal sealed classstrong, meaning its not possible to create a subclass offering the added rewriting. p  pSo this approach got me to a dead end due to the very tightly coupled ObjectContext.p  pHow to solve this problem Am I looking in the wrong direction Is there perhaps a way to inject myself around this codeObjectQueryProvidercodep  pstrongUpdatestrong While the provided solutions all work when youre wrapping the ObjectContext using the Repository pattern, a solution which would allow for direct usage of the generated subclass from ObjectContext would be preferable.

Negative 1834 pIve been writing RSpec tests for some Rails controllers and Ive discovered a strong impulse to ensure that the Authlogic authentication is working properly. I also feel like I should be verifying that each action uses the same applicationwide layout. However, writing tests for this behavior in every single action seems silly.p  pWhat Id like to see are oneline matchers for filters and layouts, similar to Shouldas matchers for associations and verifications. Unfortunately, no such matchers seem to be available except for some TestUnit macros for filters in a hrefhttpsmsohan.blogspot.com200905unittestactioncontrollerfilters.html relnofollowthis blog posta. Im tempted to just write them myself, but not being able to find anyone whos already done it makes me question whether or not a need for such matchers actually exists.p  pSo my question is, how do you test your controllers common behavior if you test it at all, and would oneliner matchers testing filters and layouts be useful Myself, Im trying to decide between oneliners in the controller specs combined with speccing the filter explicitly, or just speccing the filter and ignoring the filters and layouts in the controllers since theyre only one line of code anyway.p

The data come constantly from the network and for this I dedicated 1 thread just for the table, to update it constanlty as they come.

Negative 1834 pId like to apply a margin to the UIImageView on the left of a plain old UITableViewCell grouped style.p  pThe only way Ive found to do this via a hrefhttpatastypixel.comblogeasyroundedcornersonuitableviewcellimageview relnofollowherea is to resize the UIImage itself before attaching it to the UIImageView. If the image is smaller then the cell, it will be centred leaving the desired margin as a sideeffect.p  pWell, that works, but now my image is blurry because the 100 emunitem row height is not 100 empixelsem on an iPhone4, its 200. So I end up with a UIImage scaled to 90x90 empixelsem that produces a 90x90 emunitem 180x180 pixel UIImageView image.

I also am sending a pointer to codeMyClasscode, the same instance of the class.p  pI previously mentioned that this function is repeatedly called.  In fact, in execution it is called several thousand times before crashing.  I output the input parameters to a text file because it doesnt crash running in debugger just before going into the function.  When I do so, they have valid values before going into the function the time it crashes.  I also output from inside the function the time it crashes it doesnt make it inside the function, but crashes as it is entering.p  pThe error I get when it crashes describes it only as a codeBEXcode error, mentioning codemscorwks.dllcode as a source.p  pAny suggestions as to what the error is and how to fix it  I really have no idea what is causing this.  If I had to guess I would say something with the pointer to the object being passed into its own member function, but again I dont really have any insight into this.  It works in 64 bit and Im not running out of memory or anything.p

Right now I am doing this query by checking the task first then joining it with a query by phase and checking that no rows overlap and doing the same for project then client.

Negative 1834 pSo Im very happy with the Lucene.NET implementation on a current site other than the odd occasional index corruption.  I wont get any errors but Ill start noticing results coming back double, triple, etc.  If I use a hrefhttpcode.google.compluke relnofollowLukea Ill see oddness with the index, lots of documents showing up multiple times.  So Im thinking that maybe the finalizer  Dispose isnt being called and thus this corrupts the indicesp  pAnyone have any experience preventing this from happening  I know that if I manually delete the index files from disk that everything returns to normal.  Should I be trying to do that on each service restartp

Negative 1834 pHow well an idea are multivalued attributes in a relational database when they are to be referred extensivelyp  pLet me give you an example to show what I mean.

Negative 1834 pI have a c solution with two regular projects and a setup project. One of the regular projects is an executable, while the other is a dll, that I also use in other solutions. The dll project relies on there being a certain event log source, that it can log to, and since the program is intended to be run by users that are not allowed to create log sources, this source must be created at installation.p  pI have done this by creating an installer class for my executable project, creating the log source in the installer, and included that installer in my custom actions in the setup project. This works, but now I have to create a similar installer for every other project, that also uses that dll. p  pThe best solution would be, if I could write an installer for the dll, and then choose the dll for the custom actions in the setup project. This way I would only have to state the log creation requirement once. However, I am not able to select the dll project output for the custom actions in the setup project.p  pAnother good solution would be, if I could somehow specify that the installer for the executable should be transitive, such that it would also perform install actions for any projects that the executable project depended on, but I dont know how to specify that requirement.p  pSo what can I do to avoid duplicating installation code between different projectsp

Negative 1834 pjust started using Zend Framework and Im wondering what to do with odd classes I have. Im pretty much wondering about best practise for getting everything setup.p  pIve just enabled layout and I have the wrapping html head, body, footer etc.p  pIn my previous application I created a bundler script where you pass a list of CSS files and JS scripts in a particular order. If its in development mode then itll just loop through the filenames and print them out likep  precodeforeach CSSScripts as file      echo ltlink src . file .  refstylesheet gt   foreach JSScripts as file      echo ltscript typetextjavascript src . file . gtltscriptgt  codepre  pIf its development mode then it may print out 10 individual CSS and JS files. If its in production then it will bundle them up so theres only 1 CSS and 1 JS file.p  pWith this being within templating... Im not quite sure where the logic is supposed to go. Its logic that should exist on every page so its inside layout.phtml but where am I meant to put my classes and how am I meant to run them Do I put them in codeprojectnamelibrarycode and run the bundler logic inside codeBootstrap.phpcode then assign them to a view and call a view inside codelayout.phtmlcodep  pAlso... say I want a login form to be available at the top of every page when logged out inside codelayout.phtmlcode Im assuming. Ive created the Form codeApplicationFormLogincode but to allow logins I need to have an action within a codeControllercode Should I be playing the Login action within the codeBootstrapcode as well so that its possible to login from every page and Im not duplicating codeloginActioncode on every pagep  pBut then again theres also ZendAuth which would provide more flexibility right Maybe this is initiated inside codeBootstrapcode and then throughout codelayout.phtmlcode and any View I can just do conditionals for if youre logged inp  pAnd for landing pages where you have SEO tags in the URL... Im guessing its a case of creating a seperate ControllerView per keyword like just examples... stackoverflow computerquestions digitalclocks and then the content inside these codeViewscodep  pThanks... Im quite confused as its a different way of thinking when everything is seperated D Im used to having full control everywhere and doing what I want and where I want but thats lead to spaghetti code .p

So i understand that now when we search by an index, we just search the appropriate hashmap for the index we want, and work with the object that is its value.p  pHowever, our program also allows the user to search by name, height, weight, etc. So, how are hashmaps being used efficiently here if it only helps when searching by index What happens if i want to search a creature by name I would have to loop through every value in the hashmap, look at its name field..which is exactly what i am doing with the arraylist.p  pOur professor said this when someone asked a similar questionp  blockquote   pThe idea is that in the first project, the simple approach was to   insert all items into array lists and when one needed to link a   creature to a party, or an item to a creature, one would have to   search the ArrayList linearly until the index of the item was found.   This is On operation if the ArrayList is not sorted, and an Olog n   operation if the list is sorted, but the sorting is typically Onn   or On log n depending on the sorting operation used.p      pThis week, I am asking you to implement an O1 searching system based   on a map data structure. Thus, we should use the index of a item as   its key to generate the links. This is used once during processing of   the input file.p blockquote  pThus, I am not sure i am understanding the concept of Maps  keyvalue pairs correctly.p

Negative 1834 pIm trying to write my first html5 game. However, the game loop causes my browser to become unresponsive eventually being shut down by the browser.

So, then, heres the game loopp  precodefunction gameLoop var newTimeDate.now var deltanewTimeoldTime  updatedelta1000  render  oldTimenewTime  return state  codepre  pThis is where the crash happens. If I take out the return statement, it returns null or whatever javascript returns. And, thats fine. It runs once and exits. However, if I leave it in there, this is where the browser seizes up. The update function gives my character the ability to move and the render function draws one image to the screen. Very simple stuff.p  pNOTE This is being written in the canvas element if that matters.p  pSOLUTION I created a stateSelector function which contains the switch statement abovewithout the while. However, rather than stategameLoop, I used intervalsetIntervalgameLoop, 1. Then, I use clearIntervalinterval when I want to stop, followed immediately by stateSelector. Obviously, if I want to change the state, I do that before calling the stateSelector function. I could probably have it take in a parameter containing the state I want to go into, but that a small change that I could evaluate later. I just wanted to announce my solution in case anyone else runs into this.p

Ive set the options so that the whole tree is visible constrained false, levelsToShow 3, but the tree itself is too large for the window. I realize that it might be impossible to avoid this completely but changing the orientation on specific subtrees probably based on the depth would optimize the space that the tree occupies and put more or all of its contents in visible view.p  pIn case it isnt obvious enough by the description, the size of the trees canvas is the windows size.p  pThanks in advance I look forward to hearing any replies.p

Negative 1834 pWere working on a .NET MVC mobile site. I understand that on the iPhone, mobile safari will display a datepicker for the following input field  p  precodeltinput typedategt codepre  pWe have a standard date picker helper which spits out date picker options for various platforms. In this case we detect mobile safari and then write out an input field that is bound to our modelp  precodeltinput nameStartDate value20081221 typedategt codepre  pThe problem is that the value portion is not shown on load. We can enter in new values, and save them back to our database. But then when we reload the page those values dont show up in the fields. If we save again, our values are all set back to null in the db.p  pI noticed that when you select a date with the wheels on the iPhone, the value of the text field ends up in the format similar to Apr 6, 2012  where as Id expect it to show 20120406 or 04062012.  p  pMy guess is that the mobile safari displays a different attribute of the  field, and then sets the value attribute appropriately behind the scenes.  p  pDoes anyone know whats going on with this Thanksp

Negative 1834 pSo Im writing the TextValueChanged handler for a JTextField that takes a long as its input. It needs to only allow the user to type in valid values between 0 and Long.MAX. If the user types an invalid character, it should strip it, so that the value in the JTextField is always a valid long.p  pMy current code looks like this, but it seems ugly. With no external libs including Apache Commons, is there a cleanersimpler way to do thisp  precodepublic void textValueChangedTextEvent e      if e.getSource instanceof JTextField          String text  JTextField e.getSource.getText         try               Try to parse cleanly             long longNum  Long.parseLongtext              Check for lt 1              if longNum lt 1 throw new NumberFormatException              If we pass, set the value and return             setOptionFIELDKEY, longNum          catch NumberFormatException e1               We failed, so theres either a nonnumeric or its too large.

Negative 1834 pI have a SQLite database on an Android Device and a MySQL remote master database. The Android device user can modify the database i.e add, delete, modify records. What I want is to automatically sync the database on the Android device to the master database whenever the Android device is online. After syncing the records on the master database should reflect all the addition, deletion or in some cases modification that has taken place.p  pOkay so heres what Im thinking of doing. In the Databasehelper class that Ive created, I am going to add code in each method so that each time a method is called and the corresponding query executed in the local android database, that query string which was executed gets stored in a simple text file. So changes can keep happening in the local database and query strings will keep getting stored in the file. Itll basically create a SQL Dump right. Now when I write my JDBC MySQL connection code on the client side, Ill get it to read one line at a time from that file and execute the queries on the master MySQL server. How does it sound I guess it takes care of deletion too.p  pBut the following doubts emergep  p1 Will JDBC Connector for MySql work on an Android device Ive browsed on the net and found conflicting answers. Some say it doesnt work. Some says you just have to add the external jar file mysqlconnectorjava3.0.17gabin to the build properties of the project. Really confused about this. Have no idea of PHP so I wish this works.p  p2 After connecting, I dont think I need any results back from the MySql master database. I just need to execute the sql dump ive stored in the text file on the master database. Sounds easy enough rightp  p3 Now for the other way sync. The good thing I found on Sqlite is that even they accept SQL queries. So for the other way sync, Ill need to get the Android device to download a Sql Dump file in a particular folder and then get the database adapter ive created to read from the downloaded file and execute the queries. This is sounding far tougher.

This technique returns a pointer to where codekernel32.dllcode is located in memory.p  pNow on a different website where a similar technique was presented, they wrotep  blockquote   pNow all you need to do is locate the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress functions in there and youre good to gop blockquote  pOf course, this is true.

Negative 1834 pI am trying to design an Online Programming Contest Judge, and one of the things that I need to ensure is that when the same code is compiled assuming the requirement, given the same input, it should take exactly the same amount of time for the program to execute, each time this is done.p  pCurrently, I am using a simple python script that has 2 threads, one of which invokes a blocking system call that starts the execution of the test code, and the other keeps track of time and sends a kill signal to the child process after the time limit expires. Incidentally, I am doing this inside a virtual machine for reason of security, and convenience setting up a proper chroot is way too complicated, and more risky.p  pHowever, given identical conditions ie, when I restore a snapshot, I still get a variation in the time taken for execution in range of approximately 50ms on either side.

Negative 1834 pConsider the code bellow.p  precode Consider that MyObject receives three integers in its constructor. MyObject createObject      MyObject result1, 2, 3     return result  codepre  pAs long as I know, when you return an object in Clike in this function, the compiler will create a new objectas a local variable in the stack for the client. In this exemple, it will be a new codeMyObjectcode object that will be created using the copy constructor with coderesultcode as parameter. This implies in redundant processing for the machine the object coderesultcode will be created in the stack and then a second object will be created and returned. An alternative to avoid this is creating the object dynamicallynot in stack and then return its pointer. But it will cause memory leak or force the client to delete the object after use. So, the solution I found was to use an smart pointer, like thisp  precode Consider that MyObject receives three integers in its constructor. boostsmartptrltMyObjectgt createObject      boostsmartptrltMyObjectgt resultnew MyObject1, 2, 3     return result  codepre  pThis works, but the smart pointer still is an object that will be recreatedeven if the cost is low becouse, basically, it holds just a pointer. I was guessing if theres a way to do this a more easily or if there wasnt a way already implemented by the compiler to optimize this work or something alike. Is there a syntax to say to the compiler to do what I wantp

Negative 1834 pIve been investigating using Microsofts entity framework for a project at work.  I created a simple little data layer solution which has an IDataService interface so I could write a standard ADO.Net implementation and an Entity Framework version using LinqtoEntity.p  pIve created two tests which request exactly the same data, but use the different implementations.  The queries are simple, they retrieve data from a table, and using hierarchical information generate a DTO with the data in a hierarchy.p  pThe data in the database is along the lines ofp  precode ID   Description  1    Item 1 2    Item 2 3    Item 3 4    Item 4 5    Item 5   Parent  Child    1       2 1       3 3       4 1       5  Desired Output  Item 1 Item 2 Item 3  Item 4  Item 5 codepre  pAnd so the queries currently take the form ofp  precodefrom a in tableA join b in tableB on b.Parent equals a.ID where b.Parent  root.ID select new DTO.Entry    Id  a.ID   ...  codepre  pThe method containing this query is run recursively until there are no more child elements left to process.p  pUsing Linqtoentity the test takes about 320ms to complete, using ADO.Net the tests takes about 8msp  pIs this just something I have to live withconsider or should the performance be about on par  Also, as the underlying data structure has no referential integrity I know, so I am compensating for this in my ADO.Net stuff, but I cant with Entities, is this likely to have an impactp  pAt the moment it seems that if you want performance then you should stick with ADO.Netp

Negative 1834 pHi i need to do some coverage testing on android apk files. I do not have access to the source. Are there any such tools that will allow me to view the method calls in the apk file runtime so that I can do some functional coverage analysis I heard that some tool like emma does that for java jar files. so are there any ways for apk files  I want to run the apk in phone or simulator and watch the method calls or get the report of method calls. p  pSo here is my goal, while running the app with apk, i want a coverage report of the methods called. Now if emma can work with apk that will be nice. cause i can convert apk to jar file. but i cannot run the jar just like the apk, so running emma on the jar will not help me i guess. p

Negative 1834 pI have a program that accepts a file as input, does some work with the contents of the file and the pushes it out to a server.  I want to add an optional command line switch to specify a dry run of the program whereby it does all the file crunching, but skips doing the writes out to the server.  I am using argparse to bring in the command line arguments, but I dont see a way to do an OR function between the arguments.

And, if both are there... thats OK too. hence being an OR and not an XOR.  If I use mutually exclusive with requiredtrue, I can get the XOR but, I cant seem to figure out how to do this as an OR where both can be present.  To complicate matters, the server name is a positional argument and the dry run flag is an optional argument that could be anywhere on the command line.

Negative 1834 pI am relatively new to rubyrails and I have the following questionp  pI am working on a scheduling app and have a model named Classes and another named ClassEntries. The relationship between them is that each user can have multiple class entries per semester, each relating to one class. Each record in the Classes table belongs to a specific University. A User can have multiple entries in the ClassEntries table for 1 semester typically 5. Their schedule is comprised of all their ClassEntries with the same semester ID.p  pI am not sure whether I should have a third model called Schedule that brings together the info in the ClassEntries and Classes models for the user at hand. I originally wrote this functionality in PHP and I simply used a MySQL JOIN to gather the necessary information. In Rails it seems that there should be a better way to accomplish this.p  pWhat would be the best way of going about this in Railsp  pMany thanksp

Negative 1834 pI always wondered how JavaScript stores codenullcode values internally. codenullcode is different than any value. I imagine that the scopes variables are stored in some kind of array of structures, each structure corresponding to a variable. Does this structure has some kind of boolean property called nullp  pI would look for it myself in the V8 source code, but am am pretty lost in the C code p  pI couldnt find anything on Google. Most results were related to questions like How to determine if variable is undefined or null or similar.p
Negative 1834 pIm a beginner in scala, working on a hrefhttpaperiodic.netphilscalas99S99a to try to learn scala. One of the problems involves converting from a string to a tree data structure. I can do it manually, by I also want to see how to do it using Scalas parser combinator library.p  pThe data structure for the tree isp  precodesealed abstract class Tree[T] case class Node[T]value T, left Tree[T], right Tree[T] extends Tree[T]    override def toString  T  value.toString     left.toString     right.toString    case object End extends Tree[Nothing]    override def toString  .  object Node    def apply[T]value T Node[T]  Nodevalue, End, End      codepre  pAnd the input is supposed to be a string, like this codeabd,e,c,fg,codep  pI can parse the string using something likep  precodetrait Tree extends JavaTokenParsers   def leaf Parser[Any]  ident   def child Parser[Any]  node  leaf     def node Parser[Any]  identchild,child  leaf   codepre  pBut how can I use the parsing library to build the tree I know that I can use codecode to convert, for example, some string into an integer. My confusing comes from needed to know the left and the right subtrees when creating an instance of codeNodecode. How can I do that, or is that a sign that I want to do something differentp  pAm I better off taking the thing the parser returns codeabd,e,c,fg,code for the example input above, and building the tree based on that, rather than use parser operators like codecode or codecode to build the tree directlyp

Negative 1834 pI am trying to serve files uploaded by users with PHP.p  pWhile it would be easy to just point to the file, there seems to be agreement that you should not point directly to a directory on the site as this creates a security risk...If someone can get a malicious file past barriers onto site, it is then a cinch for them to execute it if they know where it sits on server.  Instead, recommendation is to put files in a folder outside the tree structure of the site, store name in database as something other than original name, along with a file path to the hidden directory, and serve it using a PHP file that reads and displays.  I am able to do all this and display gibberish usingp  precode get mime type somehow  headerContenttype.mimetype readfiletotalfilepath codepre  pThe problem is how to get the correct mime type so it displays a nice file instead of gibberish. p  pIf you have 5.3, you can use finfo as followsp  precodefinfo  finfoopenFILEINFOMIMETYPE headerContentType .finfofilefinfo, files.file finfoclosefinfo readfilefiles.file   codepre  pUnfortunately, finfo doesnt work in 5.2  There is also a function called p  precodemimecontenttype codepre  phowever, it is deprecated as of 4.xx and is not on my server in any case. From what I have read, there does not seem to be a reliable way to get the mime type before 5.3.  I dont want to upgrade to 5.3 as it will require upgrading of a very large site.p  pNote the files that are allowed for upload include .jpg, .gif, .png, .pdf files, the major office files, doc, docs, xls, xlx, etc. and txt files.   p  pAlso, I would be open to forcing a download of the files instead of displaying them in browser, however, first choice is displaying in browser.  p

Negative 1834 pIm trying to figure out if using localStorage is better than redis for storing sets of data that wont go over the 5MB limit of localStorage.  In the website Im implementing, the plan is when an end user goes to any page then a check is made on whether the user has the most recent data stored in localStorage.  If not, then refresh it.p  pBy doing it this way the user wont need to go to an outside datastore like redis which should make it faster.p  pI couldnt find any resources online that could answer this question.  Im not sure if the reason why is because Im going about it the wrong way or not.p  pThanks for your helpp

integration platform trying to sync created date and changed date on revisions. I am now focussing my efforts on directly querying the TFSdefaultcollection DB and getting the dates. Here is the sql.. select  from WorkItemswere where id   order by rev This will give all the revisions for a given ID. We can write a post migration script to loop thru all work items and update the created date [The CreatedDate column in WorkItemsWere will give that] and the revised date and changed date columns will have all the dates u need. However, the challenge is updating the changed dates [I am updating the Created date via the TFS API. Starightforward. Just run console app as a service account TFS user, open the work item, modify the created date and save it].  I am querying the source systems WorkItemsWere table, getting the Changed and Revision dates by each Rev and updating the target systems WorkItemsWere [Its important that the source and target systems are locked so no updats are happening during this script]. After the script ran, I picked a workitem on a taregt system and checked its history. All the history disappeared.. So, bad idea directly updating the changedrevision dates in DB. However, I found a workaround. If you just update the revision date and NOT the changed date, it does show the history. [without the Rev ]. This is an ok workaround for us. Will keep everyone posted.p

Negative 1834 pAs a quick background, Im a beginner at database programming so forgive me if anything that I post here doesnt make sense or is outright dumb.p  pIm trying to make a WinForm application that will allow users to connect to a .mdb Access 97 database of their choosing, allow the user to make changes e.g. add new data rows on WinForm which will then be applied to the original .mdb database, and sync those changes across different .mdb Access 97 databases if desired.p  pTo give you an idea of what I have so far. I have successfully connected to a .mdb Access 97 database using C and I output the database table contents into a codeDataSetcode object from which I then dumped into a codeC1FlexGridcode code will follow momentarily. Now before anyone mentions anything, I cannot upgrade the database file to a newer version, so it has to stay as an Access 97 version file.p  pHere is the code I used to connectp  precodedbConnection   new OleDbConnectionProviderMicrosoft.JET.OLEDB.4.0Data Source  path dbCommand      new OleDbCommandSELECT  from MAIN, dbConnection dbDataAdapter  new OleDbDataAdapterdbCommand  dbDataSet  new DataSetMasterLanguageDB dbConnection.Open dbConnectionIsOpen  true   connection is successful, unlock connected mode features EnterDatabaseConnectedMode  dbDataAdapter.FilldbDataSet flexGrid.DataSource  dbDataSet.Tables[0] codepre  pMy question is this is the C1FlexGrid that I now have populated with the .mdb database file contents binded to the .mdb file Because 1, I didnt bind the datasource the way Microsoft suggests doing it by way of the Add Data Source wizard in Visual Studio 2008 because the user can connect to any .mdb database they choose  not just one and 2, I want whatever changes I make to the C1FlexGrid to apply to the original database.p  pIf the answer is no, how do I create that binding or add the rows to the databasep

Negative 1834 pI have a set of integers in C03, where the integers represent guesses relative to a reference point.  The algorithm runs through a long list of items, and for each item, it tries each integer guess an expensive operation relative to the reference point of that item until it finds a match or all the guesses are exhausted.  An item matches at most one guess, but may match none.  I would like to count the number of times each relative integer guess successfully finds a match such that on each next item being iterated over, the set of guesses for that item is ordered such that those guesses with the most success come before those with less success based on the items already processed.p  pI could imagine using a stdmap that maps each relative guess to the number of times that relative guess has successfully found a match.  With that, on each items iteration, I could reverse the map and multimap all the maps values backwards to their keys.  Iterating over the second multimap in reverse, I could process the guesses on each item, starting with the most successful guesses downward until a match is found. At this point the first map would be updated to indicate which guess now has one more success.  Similarly, the second multimap would be updated to remove the matching guess from its old success count and reinserting it in its now incremented success count.p  pHowever, this seems complex and I imagine there is a more elegant answer.  Although, perhaps it is worth the wasted effort to make the code simpler to understand by rebuilding the multimap from scratch each iteration instead of trying to incrementally maintain itp  pIs there a known design pattern data structure that fits well to this problem  How can I best order my guesses such that more successful guesses bubble up to the top  Does it make sense to apply a priority queue herep

Negative 1834 pI am learning Ember.js 1.0.0rc.3 and I would like to know the proper way to create a dynamic MVC app. What I mean by Dynamic MVC is that the only content I have when hitting the index page is a collection of entity names. The rest will be dynamically generated, i.e. model data, eventually specific actions for the controllers, and specially templates.p  pHere is what I am trying to achieve I have a collection of entities such as [User, Customer, Invoice, etc]. I expect the route for each entity to bep  precode...user ...customer ...invoice codepre  blockquote   pcodefor each entity namecodep      blockquote     pthis.resourcecodeentity name lower casecodep   blockquote blockquote  pTo make it simple for the explanation, hitting an entity route will display a view with 2 links. One to create a new entity, one to display a list of entities. The routes will then bep  precode...user                gt will display a Create link and List link ...usercreate         gt sub route to display a form to create a User ...userlist           gt sub route to display a collection of existing Users  ...customer ...customercreate ...customerlist  ...etc... codepre  pNow the templates for the sub routes em...usercreateem, em...userlistem, etc. dont exist but instead will be loadedcreated on demand. Thats part of a new UI Design Pattern named SSD Sketch, Schema, Data where a template is generated based on a Sketch a skeleton of a view, a Schema specific to that view. Same for the actions.p  pstrong1 First questionstrong.  Knowing that I may end up with 100 entities, strongis it a correct approach to have a Controller, a Model, a View for each routestrong And as well sub routes... I am a bit concerned about the performances here as all these objects are created when hitting the index page.p  pIn the current sample, I will have the following Ember objectsp  precodeUserController, UserRoute, UserView UserCreateController, UserCreateRoute, UserCreateView UserListController, UserListRoute, UserListView CustomerController, CustomerRoute, CustomerView CustomerCreateController, CustomerCreateRoute, CustomerCreateView CustomerListController, CustomerListRoute, CustomerListView etc. it becomes easily heavy codepre  pI tried to link multiple paths to the same MVC objects but then its hard to identify the current entity used. Analyzing the current path, if doable, seems really ugly. For instancep  precodethis.resourceentity,  path   user  this.resourceentity,  path   customer  this.resourceentity,  path   invoice  all attached to EntityController, EntityView and EntityRoute Could be working but hard to identity which entity User, Customer or Invoice is really used  this.resourceentity.create,  path   user  create  this.resourceentity.create,  path   customer  create  this.resourceentity.create,  path   invoice  create  Same for EntityCreate codepre  pI also tried to use this.controllerForentity, this.controllerForentity.create, this.controllerForentity.list but this doesnt reduce the number of objects and it makes the code more complicated than it should be.p  pstrong2 Second Questionstrong To be able to work on dynamic templates, I implement setController with an ajax call to load the necessary SSD which will be used to create the template and also the model. I save the template to Ember.TEMPLATES[codetemplate namecode], change a data property, and attach an observer to the renderTemplate of the Route.p  pstrongIs it the proper way of dynamically changing a templatestrongp  pHere is a sample not tested, just to see the process of loadingchanging a template and modelp  precodeApp[UserCreateRoute]  Ember.Route.extend     templateName loading,  display a temporary template while loading the template     renderTemplate function          this.renderthis.gettemplateName,              ...              .observestemplateChanged,      setupController functioncontroller, model           var self  this          .when ajax load .donefunction response                var templateName  xxx   based on the entity for instance usercreate              if template doesnt exist                  Ember.TEMPLATES[templateName]  CreateMyTemplate response                  self.settemplateName, templateName                           also change the model             self.setdata, reponse.someData               eventually add method to the controller             ...              tell renderTemplate to rerender             self.settemplateChanged, new Date               ,      model functionparams          simplified for sample         return this.getdata       codepre  pIts a bit long, thanks for readingp

But in refactoring, Ive found that much of it doesnt fit neatly into one class that falls cleanly in the Single Responsibility Principle. I want to put it all into a single module, but the methods will have to do with time formatting, viewing permissions, and a few other things.p  pAs I see it, I have a few choices. And I bet you can suggest others. From an object oriented point of view, which approach should I go with and whyp  ol liUse one single module shared between both of the classes. It may not have a specific single responsibility, but it does clean up the code significantly, and keeps it all in one place.li liMake tiny classes and mix in to both classes as modules. They will all have a single responsibility, but there will be many of them, some of which may only have one method. Seems like a waste.li liPerhaps use a presenter for things like time formatting, and a permissions module shared between both classes. Perhaps cleaner, but methods are going to be everywhere.li liAnother possibility I havent yet consideredli ol  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis question had previously mentioned codeClinicAppointmentcode and codeClinicVisitcode classes, rather than A and B.

Negative 1834 pI have a form with lots of nested splitcontainers and listviews and a picturebox and stuff. When certain things happen in my program I want an overlay to appear over everything in a little box in the middle of my form with a short message. Then if possible have it fade away.

Negative 1834 pMy goal is to create a way fill a PDF form from a database. I have an inventory of items that I want to track and would like to do so by outputting to an existing pdf form. I would like to use a database that can easily be edited by a gui like access that is installed on the computers at work. I am on work computers and am not sure if I will be able to run an exes on themlike trying to use java with iText.p  pThat sums up my goals and issues. I am very new to programming and was thinking I could do this with a webpage and have the database and the pdf form all stored in the same file and use the webpage to make queries to fill the pdf form while using access to edit the database for the inventory.p  pIt appears php would be the best way to do this but it looks like php requires a server to run its code. So I was thinking I could host the php code on a server and attempt to access a the database at work using the dbs shared drive location. Since I am new to database I am not sure if that is possible or if I would need to have the database hosted on a server.p  pDoes anyone have any recommendations on how I could accomplish this. I was thinking about just having it all server based but I signed up for 1and1 hosting to experiment with and its MySQL database cannot be accessed remotely. I guess this is not a big problem but it would require me to develop my own gui for db editing.p  pI am not necessarily looking for code examples, just big picture ideas on how to accomplish this.p

Negative 1834 pso i wrote a program to read words from a file and insert, remove or search them in a binary search tree. It seemed like everything was working fine but somehow when inserting a word in a binary search tree, from the second word onwards the root pointer I pass as the parameter of the insert function is shifted to point at the word being inserted. So instead of inserting the word the function only increases the occurence of the first word. I sincerely dont know how this is happening.

Negative 1834 pI am writing a remote LotusDomino NSCO Notes CORBA API Java client for reading and writing to a Domino server. The client should roughly be able to act and simulate all the features of Lotus Notes desktop client for a users mailbox Mail, Calendar, Tasks.p  pThose of you experienced with NSCO.jar are probably already aware of many limitations it has. One example is marking a document as readunread, which isnt implemented with this API. To bypass this, my latest direction is writing a Java Agent on the server side, which would use Java Notes local API to mark a document as readunread. I can later call this client using the NSCO API. I would like to be able to call this agent for every user every user has his own database, but I dont like the idea of creating an instance of this agent on each database. According to this, my question is    How if possible can I register an Agent in Domino so that is available for every userp  pApart from this specific question, I would very much appreciate any links towards good documentation or books on this topic. I believe I have already browsed through most of online documentation, and its quite poor or outofdate so books might be more usefulp  pThanks.p

Negative 1834 pI have a large software project that some folks have just started dumping things into instead of creating a development branch ARG incrementally as they make sweeping changes. There are problems with some of the things they did, and of course they are on holiday. So I used Perforce to try to get the baseline at a particular point in time. Perforce claimed to get all the files at that point in time, but it did not build. I know that it did build originally, as our CruiseControl successfully built it at that point in the history.p  pSo obviously something is wrong with Perforce. Below is some fabulous ASCII art showing the structure of the checkins to Perforce. Letters indicate different developers, numbers indicate their checkins.p  precodeNewest     D 18     D 17   Changed the contents of the files in D 16     D 16   They did some movedelete and adddelete here     D 15     D 14     D 13     D 12     C 1     B 2     D 11     D 10     D 9     D 8     D 7     D 6     D 5     D 4     A 3     A 2     D 3     D 2     D 1     B 1     A 1 Oldest codepre  pD18 doesnt work. D17 does, but I want to test at B2 to simplify things. p  pC1 is the CruiseControl version that built and ran just fine when it built last week. It only changed the version number in a text file. No big deal.p  pI want B2, so I do a Force get at B2. It doesnt build, even though it did when I checked it in. So I remove all the files and do a Force get at B2. It still doesnt build. I wondered what I could have done to it, and finally decided to try to get even earlier. p  pIf I go all the way down and get A1, it builds. I can then get B2 and it will build even if I delete all the files from A1. I can keep going up until D16, which does not build. D17 does build. The interesting thing is when I go up the tree, from oldest to newest, B2 builds and runs fine. When I go down the tree from D16 or newer, B2 does not build nor run. If I start at A1, and go up the tree to D15 and then go back down the tree to B2, it builds and works. Once I have gotten D16, strongnothingstrong older builds unless I go all the way back to A1. I dont understand the linkageproblem. There seems to be no connection between A1 and D16 at all. A1 is a simple data file change which isnt even compiled. A1 was before these guys started dumping sweeping changes into the baseline, but even then, I expect Perforce to be able to replicate a changelist the strongexactstrong same moving either direction in time.p  pI have been operating under the impression that if I do a force get on a particular changelist, then I will get strongeverythingstrong that was checked in at that point in time yes, I understand you can ask Perforce to only give you that changelists files, but I did not do that.p  ul liI have nothing checked out in this repository. li liI delete all the files each time.li liI do a codeForcecode get every time. li ul  pI can build now, but I want to be able to trust my configuration management tool.

I did a force get latest, and it still looked like it. I deleted the file, then got the latest, and it still claimed I had edited it. I closed P4V and reopened it, to find the file was as I expected it to be. Somehow, the GUI got confused. So the takeaway is if it looks weird, restart the GUI and see if that helps. strongMaybestrong this could have helped with my issue above.p

However, if I replace the fileName variable with a hardcoded option similar to the following, it works just fine  p  precodeaudioFile.savedownloadBuffer, Audio.wav codepre  pIdeally, I would love to derive the duration of the file based on the length of the byteArray using the following p  precodeGet the duration in seconds as it is an audio file encoded in 44.1k var durationInSecondsNumber  downloadBuffer.length  44100  Grab the minutes and seconds var mNumber  Math.floordurationInSeconds  60 var sNumber  Math.floordurationInSeconds  60  Create the file name using those values audioFile.savedownloadBuffer, m.toString    s.toString  .wav codepre  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1834 pI am looking since some time for a way to play MIDI in Delphi XE5 with Android targeted. Several of my questions before were related to this quest . I have filed two requests to embarcadero a hrefhttpqc.embarcadero.comwcqcmain.aspxd119422 relnofollow119422a to add MIDI support to TMediaPlayer and a hrefhttpqc.embarcadero.comwcqcmain.aspxd119422 relnofollow119423a to add a MIDI framework to Firemonkey, but that did not help. I have succeeded at last. As I know there are some more people who were looking for MIDI on Android I post this question with answer for documentation.p

Negative 1834 pI think this question may violate some of the QampA standards for the site, as the answers I may receive could be regarded as opiniondriven. Nevertheless, here it goes...p  pSuppose were working on a C project, using CMake to drive the buildtestingpackaging process, and GTest and GMock for testing. Further suppose the structure of our project looks like thisp  precodecoolproject   source     modulefoo       bunch of source files     modulebar     yet more source files   tests   modulefoo     tests for modulefoo   modulebar   tests for modulebar codepre  pThis is, of course, an oversimplified situation, but you get the idea.p  pNow well, if these modules are libraries and every test i.e. every directory under codetestscode is an executable, we need to link the latter with the former. The thing is, if these libraries are shared, the loader needs of course to find them. An obvious solution is to set the tests working directory to the librarys directory, using CMakes codesetpropertycode. However, if both GTest and GMock were also built as shared libraries, this wont work as they need to be also loaded.p  pThe solutions I came up with werep  ul liCopy both libraries i.e. GTest and GMock to the modules build directory. This feels kind of stupid as the main benefit of shared libraries i.e. to share code among programs gets completely bypassed and we end up with several copies of these all over the build directory.li liBuild both GTest and GMock as static libraries instead. This means that we now end up with a copy of both libraries into every executable, which increases its size. Even though we dont have 1000 tests, this feels somehow awkward.li ul  pSo, given this situation, I would like to know if anyone has ever been struck with it, and what path did heshe take. If the solution was other than the ones I mentioned, I would be happy to hear all about it. Ideally, Id like to be in a position in which I could codemake ampamp make testcode and have all the tests run, without having to run any extra script to accommodate things. Having all libraries built as static libraries does the job, but what if Im building them as shared libraries instead Must I build them twice Thats silly.p  pThe other problem also runs along these lines, but I think its solution involves a redesign or a similar artifact. Lets suppose codemodulefoocode depends on a thirdparty library, e.g. codelibrarybazcode. If codemodulefoocode links directly to codelibrarybazcode, then any test on the former would need to load codelibrarybazcode, even though it may be testing an unrelated functionality. Same issue arises.p  pMocking seems like the right thing to do here, but somehow I feel it doesnt make much sense to refactor codemodulefoocode in order for it to talk to an interface be it by virtue of either dynamic or static polymorphism as it doesnt need such flexibility codelibrarybazcode does the job. I suppose some people would say something like Sure, you dont need the flexibility today, but who knows tomorrow. That seems counterintuitive to me, trying to preview all possible scenarios a system may run into, but then again, there are people out there with far more experience than me.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 1834 pI am working on a programme which needs to check the sum of the input of 4 sides against each other and output something according to the highest sum. I have made an algorithm using codeifcode and codeelifcode statements which works but the problem is that its about 250 lines of code long. So I started working on a different proper way of checking these variables against each other and I created the code below. The only problem is that this code doesnt work if 2 or 3 of the sums are the same. This is due to the use of the codemaxcode function which only outputs one of the maximum values. Now I was wondering if there was a way to make this so if for example the codesumrightcode and codesumleftcode were the same it would output both the stringskeys  codeleftcode and the string coderightcode. So I can check and then choose which of the sides to execute. So far in browsing this forum and going through the python documentation I havent found an answer.

Negative 1834 pI need to add some extra fields to a bunch of entitiesclasses and i would like to get those fields included in each entityclass. I could write all the fields in each class and it will work but im looking for a way to centralize the definitions of the fields and related methods, just to make it more maintainable and let me distribute modification, just editing a single file. I got it working using inheritance but in that manner, there will be a parent classtable, which will keep track of the children classestables either with InheritanceTypeSINGLETABLE or emInheritanceTypeJOINEDem and this could dramatically affect the performances, as the number of records will increase.

Something like thisp  precodeclass Test      public         void Create                      A a               B b               vecA.pushbacka             vecB.pushbackb                   A GetAunsigned int i                      return ampvecA[i]                   B GetBunsigned int i                      return ampvecB[i]               private         stdvectorltAgt vecA         stdvectorltBgt vecB  codepre  pNow, the problem is that whenever I add another struct into the program I have to add bunch of stuff into that class. For example, if I add another struct lets call it emCem, I have to add another vector, another pushback call, and create the emGetCem method.p  pNow, my question is Is there a better way to do thatp  pHeres one way I thought of doing itp  precodeclass ContainerBase      public         ContainerBase         virtual ContainerBase         virtual void Add   template lttypename Tgt class Container  public ContainerBase      public              Singleton             static Containeramp Instance                              static Container instance                 return instance                           void Add                              T t                   bag.pushbackt                           T Getunsigned int i                              return ampbag[i]                       private             Container             Container              stdvectorltTgt bag   class Test      public         template lttypename Tgt         void Register                      containers.pushbackampContainerltTgtInstance                   void Create                      for unsigned int i  0 i lt containers.size i                 containers[i]gtAdd                   template lttypename Tgt         T Getunsigned int i                      return ContainerltTgtInstance.Geti               private         stdvectorltContainerBasegt containers  codepre  pI tried to solve it by creating a templated class emContainerem for managing the vector of each type. As you can see, it involves using a singleton pattern to make sure that theres always a emContainerem for the particular type of struct. The types of structs just need to be registered with the class using the emRegisterem method, so that emTestem knows which emContainersem it should add the new structs to, when the new batch is created. This solution is problematic because it introduces global state to the containers, and by doing that makes it impossible to create two instances of the emTestem class that dont share their vectors for a certain type of structs. If I dont make the containers singletons, than there is no way I could access them by type in the emTestems Get function, I would have to know which index in the emcontainersem vector corresponds to what type of container.p  pI feel that there should be a better way to do this.p

However, the other aspect of my question that nobody has really addressed so far is how and why Netbeans chooses the prime numbers that it does for its generated methods. The codehashcode field and the other multiplier code89code in my example seem to be different depending on various factors of the class.p  pFor example, if I add a second codeStringcode to the class, hashCode becomesp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic int hashCode      int hash  7     hash  13  hash  this.id     hash  13  hash  Objects.hashCodethis.bar     hash  13  hash  Objects.hashCodethis.baz     hash  13  hash  Arrays.hashCodethis.things     return hash  codepre  pSo, why does Netbeans choose emthese specificem primes, as opposed to any other onesp

The only difference between these 2 bits of code, I think, is that in the latter, codetimecodes value has changed by the time codesetPausecode is called the second time and since the first instance has closure access to a different value for codetimecode its considered different and not getting removed. How can I get around thisp

Negative 1834 pI have spent quite a bit of time scouring the overflow forums and using other resources to try and figure this out without success. My apologies if this has been answered elsewhere. But, to my knowledge it hasnt p  pHere is a little background. I have some experience with SQL, Visual basic and Auto Hot Key awesome program. Currently I am trying to learn more than the basic stuff I know about SQL little rusty too.p  pFor my previous and current job I worked a lot with IBMs iSeries or Mainframe as some veterans like to call it. Specifically its version IBM DB2 PE 9.7 FP5 SRM R1 on the DB2 i5OS. p  pAs you may know, iSeries related emulators have a feature that allows its users to record macros for later playback. This feature of course has its limitations. I have written some from scratch in Visual Basic that are more flexible in the operations that they can perform. However, you can only do so much with VB.p  pRegardless of how you look at it, iSeries is slow IMO. In order to passretrieve information tofrom its databaseserver its users are limited to the speed of the program among other things. VB macros are subject to smart pausestimeouts as these are needed for scripts to work like auto hot keyp  piSeries does have a feature where you can query information, interact with libraries schemas if I have that right and tables using the i5OS Query manager. It also has an FTP feature which has its uses I guess. I have started playing around with Powershell and SSHQshell, I have read a lot of documenation in IBMs extensive support section on their site regarding iSeries and all things related. p  pstrongSo here are the questionsstrongp  ol lipIs qshellSSH an efficient way to retrieve information from a database, or more specifically, the libraries that DB2 for iSeries uses .lib.file extension filespli lipWouldnt writing SQL scripts and executing them via SSHQshell be faster than using the iSeries emulator itselfpli lipIs this only possible via port forwarding or tunnelingpli lipHow do I find out more about the server via SSH commands I can navigate the servers directories pretty easily and view files that I otherwise cannot see within iSeries. Its database files are .lib.file.mbr file extensions that I cannot view using the cat command. This would require using SQL commands I am assumingpli lipDo I need to log on as a root user in order to have readwrite access privelages and perform anything SQL relatedpli ol  pAs mentioned above I have played around with sshqshell but I am having difficulty bringing up the mysqlsql prompt to do anything I am using openSSH 4.7p1  a unix CLI which I believe changes from  to  when you successfully do this. I have been able to do this but am unable to execute any SQL related commands so I am not sure what I am doing wrong.p  pBelow is an example of me logging into the server over ssh via powershell and trying to execute something SQL relatedp  pPS H ssh 1 myusernameblabla.something.com mysql u myusername e show tablesp  penter password passwordp  pconnectedp  pCould not chdir to home directory homemyusername A file or directory in the path name does not existp  pbsh mysql execute permission deniedp  pbsh cannot executep  pConnection closed to blabla.something.comp  pstrongThis is an example of just logging in over ssh as normalstrongp  pssh 1 myusernameblabla.something.comp  pCould not chdir to home directory homemyusername A file or directory in the path name does not existp  p Mysqlp  pmysql execute permission deniedp  p mysqlp  blockquote   pshow databasesp blockquote  pmysqlp  pshow databases not foundp  pAny insight as to what I am doing wrong or feedback on my questions is greatly appreciated. I know there are alternatives to what I am trying to do using PuTTY not really an option at work, ODBC drivers cant really download an IBM iSeries fixpack to get the drivers or repair the installation of iSeries as I cant anyways I dont have Windows admin privsp  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr First, I want to thank you all for your comments and your insight. p  pstrongWarrenstrong Thank you, for you insight. IBM DB2 PE 9.7 FP5 SRM R1 is indeed DB2 LUW, or COBRA. This particular emulator is an adaption of IBMs 3270 emulator. This knock off brought to you by attachmate they added a couple bells and whistles and no longer offer support, ODBC drivers etc. Within this version, I have the option to utilize IBM DB2 Query Manager for i5OS. I would agree that the server is partitioned I think as I have been able to call different prompts like DB2SQLJJAVA, just havent been too successful with using them lol. Perhaps my attempts below will reveal a little more.p  pstrongJamesstrongbr Thank you for your input, I never thought to do this from powershell directly. As for the redbook, have it Im still reading it though. This may be a little more advanced than where I currently stand with powershell and ADO.NET. I will need to take a more in depth look at your coding example to gain a better understanding of it.p  pstrongBuckstrongbr I appreciate your point by point feedback. Not sure what your setup is, but IBM i in general especially anything after i5 is insanely fast. The company I work for.. or at least the immediate people I work with, know very little in regards to ivbaqshetc. To put it politely. So, much of what I have learned has been through reading and applying what I learn. This, actually, is only my second post. On any website, ever. I dont like to just post away because I cant figure something out in a minute. Im stubborn and will spend hours if I have to make a script work.p  pAs for STRSQL, the equivalent I use is STRQRY. From reading IBMs i5OS Query Manager PDF 300 pgs . I would agree that this is a very powerful tool. The only drawback is 1. you have to make a form that will format the query and 2. You have to create the Query using SQL   . This is no big deal whatsoever. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of schemas, and sometimes  thousands of .FILE extensions within any given LIB among other extension types. Luckily I have narrowed this down to the primary LIB that I access most. Unfortunately, there are something like 4000 files extensions within this library and files within some of those files    . Going through all of them is a little time consuming to say the least.p  pThere are some macros that perform a query in batch and then prints the data to a formatted file onto the server which takes erm... like 30 mins for 500600 pages. Is there any way I could view the parameters of this batch run Work with queriesquery forms p  pThe primary reason I am more so interested in using QSHSQL to perform a query and navigate a database is due to the fact I would like to improve my SQL skillz beginner but I would like to be able to apply this knowledge to other environments in the future.p  pGod, I write too much sp  pstrongMy recent effortsstrong I am sorry.

Negative 1834 pOk, Im at a loss.  I have a tableview that works fine in iPhone 55S, but can only manage 4 fps on an iPhone 4.  Ive tried every trick in the book to optimize the cells opaque, misaligned frames, no blending, render uilabels into images, static cell heights, etc, but it didnt even move the needle.  Thinking that the root cause could be somewhere else, I decided to strip out all my custom cell code so that codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode returns an empty but reused UITableViewCell, and even that runs slow...  Ive tried profiling the app while scrolling the tableview, but nothing stands out at all.  The only thing that seems suspicious is that if turn on CoreAnimations codeColor Hits Green and Misses Redcode, the status bar will constantly flash between green and red as I scroll the tableview.  This leads me to believe that the status bar is being redrawn every frame or every couple of frames, but even hiding the status bar didnt improve the fps by much maybe 4  7.  p  pSo.... Im at a loss.

Negative 1834 pId be grateful if people could help me find an efficient way probably low memory algorithm to tackle the following problem.p  pI need to find the stationary distribution codexcode of a transition matrix codePcode. The transition matrix is an extremely large, extremely sparse matrix, constructed such that all the columns sum to 1. Since the stationary distribution is given by the equation codePx  xcode, then codexcode is simply the eigenvector of codePcode associated with eigenvalue 1.p  pIm currently using GNU Octave to both generate the transition matrix, find the stationary distribution, and plot the results. Im using the function codeeigscode, which calculates both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and it is possible to return just one eigenvector, where the eigenvalue is 1 I actually had to specify 1.1, to prevent an error. Construction of the transition matrix using a sparse matrix is fairly quick, but finding the eigenvector gets increasingly slow as I increase the size, and Im running out of memory before I can examine even moderately sized problems.p  pMy current code isp  precode[v l]  eigsP, 1, 1.01 x  v  sumv codepre  pGiven that I know that 1 is the eigenvalue, Im wondering if there is either a better method to calculate the eigenvector, or a way that makes emmore efficient use of memoryem, given that I dont really need an intermediate large dense matrix. I naively triedp  precoden  sizeP,1        number of states Q  P  speyen,n x  Qzerosn,1     solve PIx  0 codepre  pwhich fails, since Q is singular by definition.p  pI would be very grateful if anyone has any ideas on how I should approach this, as its a calculation I have to perform a great number of times, and Id like to try it on larger and more complex models if possible.p  pAs background to this problem, Im solving for the equilibrium distribution of the number of infectives in a cattle herd in a stochastic SIR model. Unfortunately the transition matrix is very large for even moderately sized herds. For example in an SIR model with an average of 20 individuals 95 of the time the population is between 12 and 28 individuals, codePcode is 21169 by 21169 with 20340 nonzero values i.e. 0.0005 dense, and uses up 321 Kb a full matrix of that size would be 3.3 Gb, while for around 50 individuals codePcode uses 3 Mb. codexcode itself should be pretty small. I suspect that codeeigscode has a dense matrix somewhere, which is causing me to run out of memory, so I should be okay if I can avoid using full matrices.p

Negative 1834 pI am a Chrome for Business and Education admin for a fleet of chromebooks which I have configured to run in a hrefhttpssupport.google.comchromeaanswer3316168hlen relnofollowSingle App Kiosk modea. The kiosk app in question is really simple. All I did was take a hrefhttpssupport.google.comchromeaanswer3316168hlenkiosk relnofollowthe example code from this pagea that uses the webview tag without controls, as we need all the whole screen for the app in question and change the URL. The app has installed perfectly in all managed devices.p  pThe problem now is that there are times when we want to be able to exit the kiosk app and return to the chromebook login screen. Right now the only way of doing this is to shut the machine down, start it and exit from the kiosk app boot screen by pressing CtrlAltS. The whole process takes 30 seconds plus per machine the fleet contains 50. So we really need to be able to just quit out of the kiosk app and go back to the login screen which would take about 5 seconds or less.p  pNow, I could just add a quit button to the screen as per the second example app with navigation controls from the page referenced above but this means we lose screen space for the app. The preferred solution is to close the app with keystrokes e.g. CtrlShiftL. But how do you do this emin this contextem I have tried adding conventional onkeydown javascript to the page containing the webview tag and this seems to be ignored. I have also tried using the chrome commands API, and whilst I can see that the shortcut had been registered against the extension by clicking Keyboard shortcuts on the chromeextensions tab it has no effect. The kiosk app window remains stubbornly open. p  pDoes anyone know if this is possible and if so howp  pCheers,p  pMilesp

Negative 1834 pI have seen many implementations for this but I got this new idea about which I couldnt be sure. So I need an opinion here. p  pThe idea is that instead of looking up the table for codearctangygxcode, look for code1gxcode in one table and multiply the result with codegycode. Then lookup for codearctancode. The reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as division is more expensive than multiplication. But the limitation is that I can have a codemaximum of 10 address bitscode. Whereas, multiplication will give me twice the number of bits in codegxcode. codegxcode itself is 8 bits. If I right shift codegy1gxcode by 6 bits to get a 10 bit address, p  pWhat could be the degree of errorp

Negative 1834 pI will begin by saying that I am very new to Prolog, and that it is still very hard for me to come up with a solution and not think it in a procedural or a functional way. p  pThe context of the problem is as follows I have to move in four directions starting from the initial position 0,0. When I move up I update my position to 0,1, down to 0, 1, left to 1,0 and right to 1, 0. At some point I have to go back to my initial position. p  pI have solved the problem by memorizing all the moves that I do to a certain point and then do the reverse. So if the moves I did were down, left I just go up, west. The solution works, but it is very inefficient and dumb. p  pSo the thing I want to do is to make a procedure that takes the current position X,Y and evaluates to one of the four moves if by updating the position I am closer to 0,0. p  pI have tried to write some code, but the truth is that I dont really know how to think the problem in Prolog. Can someone give me some hints how I can solve it  Thank you p

Negative 1834 pIm aware that it is now possible for users to upload files via HTML file inputs from their iPhones in mobile Safari.p  pIn a desktop browser, if a file input already has a file selected, if you click the browse button, and then dont select a file, the file input resets to being blank.p  pIt seems that in mobile Safari this behavior doesnt exist.

Negative 1834 pIs it possible to tell bullet that something has happened in the past so it can take this information and adjust internal interpolation to show this change in the present There would never be a need to go back in time more than 15 seconds, 5 being a very rare occasion, more realistically between 1.5 and 2.5 seconds is where most of the change would occur.p  pThe ability to query an objects position, rotation, and velocities at a specific time in the past would be needed as well, but this can easily be accomplished.p  pThe reason behind all of this would be to facilitate easier synchronization of two physics simulations, specifically in a networked environment.p  pA server constantly running the simulation in realtime would send position, rotation, and velocity updates to client simulations at periodic intervals. These updates would arrive at the client in the past from the client simulations perspective due to network latency, thus the need to query the updated objects values in the past to see if they are different arises, if they are different the need to change these values in the past is also necessary. During the next simulation step bullet would take these pastchanges into account and update the object accordingly.p  pIs this ability present in bullet or would it need to be emulated somehow If emulation is needed could someone point me in the correct direction to getting started on this rewind and replay featurep  pIf you are unfamiliar with rewind and replay this article goes into great detail about the theory behind implementation for someone who may be going about creating their own physics library. a hrefhttpgafferongames.comgamephysicsn relnofollowhttpgafferongames.comgamephysicsna ... dphysicsp

Negative 1834 pIm wondering how to restrict the movement of a draggable dom node to only up and down, and ideally, also restrict the maximum distance it can be dragged. Pure javascript answers please. p  pIm hoping there is some way to interact with the native draggable stuff, rather than implementing it from scratch using mouse events.p  pUpdate to be perfectly clear, when i say restrict the movement im talking about restricting the movement of the element being dragged. For example, if you click to drag and try dragging the dom node diagonally, I want the dom node to only change its y axis.p

I tried to carefully follow the CUDA C programming guide, and registermap the CUDA resource with the PBO and the texture as well as with the actual input data. Since my input image data comes from OpenCV, I simply copied codeflippedcodes data into the device pointer codedevinpcode. I correctly mapped the codedevinpcode to the CUDA resource using codecudaGraphicsResourceGetMappedPointercode as well. Yet, the window does not display anything, and remains black. There are no viewport changes, and the coordinates that I specify at codeglBegin.. glEndcode are correct as they properly map codeflippedcodes data to the texture. p  pstrongAm I missing something else here Am I mapping the CUDA resource incorrectly to the PBO or the device pointerstrongp  pstrongOpenGL  CUDA interop portionstrong This portion is specifically only the CUDA  OpenGL interoperation in my code.

Negative 1834 pI  have data in a SQL Table and I want to query some  columns of  the existing data in XML Formatusing For XML  or any best practice  and then update the XML FOrmat  into a column in the same table with XML datatype .If you notice the example below , the Node SALARY is not a column name and its a constant value.  In this sample there are 2 AMT columns as AMT1 and AMT2 which might vary as AMT3  sometimes and accordingly the SALARY NODE Should also increment with the next number .If any one advice how to approach it would be of great help.

Thanks Mikael, That was very helpful ,I could get the idea on specifying dummy nodes , but the requirement is , the number of amount nodes might vary depending on data and so the SALARY node will also depend on that  .. like for some records it could be just one AMT1, some might have 3 AMT columns.. so it could vary and accordingly and so the query has to be built dynamically . I could even use a stored procedure . Thanks ..p  pHi , Any idea how to concatenate 2 xml variables in a Stored Procedure.  p

Negative 1834 pWe are developing a web application that uses Require.js and Handlebars, and it works correctly in all browsers except of course IE9. In IE9, the requests that are made by the Handlebars Require.js module codehbs.jscode to load Handlebars resources are randomly aborted  sometimes, they succeed, and when they fail, there is no clear pattern as to which requests fail other than the fact that only Handlebars requests fail all requests for JavaScript resources succeed. In the Network pane, the request is listed as codeAbortedcode, and the initiator is codePending...code, with no further information.p  pThis is probably not a configuration error, since it works everywhere else, but rather a problem with the frameworks browser compatibility, so Im omitting the configuration.

It works if I remove codecode quantifier but input string can be without this group at all codeaaacccdddcode and I still need to determine if it is codefoocode or codebarcode or codenullcode.

I used the online .htaccess tester at a hrefhttphtaccess.madewithlove.be relnofollowhttphtaccess.madewithlove.bea to build my file first, and it appeared to be correct there. However, when I actually implemented it I had a problem. If I go to https for any of the regular pages it works and Im redirected to the http version just fine. However if I go to shop, cart, or user no matter if its with http or https i just get redirected to the home page with http.

Negative 1834 pIm creating a mobile app using Angular. Im using ngView and routes to represent the different screens e.g. login screen, search results screen and details screen for the search result you click on. The problem I find with ngView is that is completely recreates each screen when I navigate back and forth between screens so I lose the current search results and the scroll position on the search screen when I navigate back to it. I know I can use a service to remember state but this seem overly manual and cumbersome and I have many screens to do this for.p  pIs there a way I can get similar results to using ngView and routes to represent my screens where the scroll position and controller state arent lost when navigating between screensp  pI think I could do it using ngShow and ngHide to hide the divs that represent screens but this doesnt sound elegantp

Negative 1834 pIm using EF 6 and WebApi 2 to serialize entities out to JSON via JSON.Net AKA Newtonsoft.p  pEverything works fine as long as I dont have a nested object.

I tried messing with the codeProxyCreationEnabledcode but that makes no difference true or false.p  pI tried using the JSON serializers codeReferenceLoopHandling.Ignorecode that appears like its supposed to detect the loop and simply stop serializing at that point but it gets into an infinite loop.p  pEDIT Heres my api routep  precode     GET apiUser     public IQueryableltUsergt GetPositions              db.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled  false         db.Configuration.LazyLoadingEnabled  false         return db.Users             .Includee gt e.Department      codepre  pAnd heres the WebApiConfigp  precode         Web API routes         config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes          config.Routes.MapHttpRoute             name DefaultApi,             routeTemplate apicontrollerid,             defaults new  id  RouteParameter.Optional                    var json  config.Formatters.JsonFormatter         json.SerializerSettings.PreserveReferencesHandling  Newtonsoft.Json.PreserveReferencesHandling.None  returns 500 error if None, returns unwanted data and format if Objects         config.Formatters.Removeconfig.Formatters.XmlFormatter          GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Formatters.Clear         GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Formatters.Addjson codepre  pUPDATE I did a codeToListcode on the results of the query before they end up returned from my api call.

Negative 1834 pI have quite simple question about common workflow for a case when you have two branchesp  ol lipretrunkpremasterli litrunkmasterli ol  pYou have an application which is developed by several people. You have a bunch of external testsseparate from app, not unit tests for pretrunkpremaster branch and run them as a check before merging the code to trunkmaster. You have a CI say jenkins for that.p  pMy question is when two people make a parallel commits to pretrunkpremaster how should I organize my jobs on CI Sequential or parallel p  pI.e. if I do it in a parallel way then there is a chance thatp  ul licommit A is tested against tests and merged to trunkmasterli licommit B is tested against tests and merged to trunkmasterli limerged commit AB is strongNOTstrong tested against tests li ul  pif I do in a sequential way then I havep  ul licommit A is tested against tests and merged to trunkmasterli licommit B is either fails because it is not up to date or rebasedli licommit B is tested against tests and merged to trunkmasterli lievery commit strongHAVE TO WAITstrong until previous jobcommit is processed and completedli ul  pWhat is the best way to do itp  pP.s. Here is problem definition from GitLab FAQp  blockquote   pIn old workflows the Continuous Integration CI server commonly ran   tests on the master branch only. Developers had to ensure their code   did not break the master branch. When using GitLab flow developers   create their branches from this master branch so it is essential it is   green. Therefore each merge request must be tested before it is   accepted. CI software like Travis and GitLab CI show the build results   right in the merge request itself to make this easy. One drawback is   that they are testing the feature branch itself and not the merged   result. What one can do to improve this is to test the merged result   itself. The problem is that the merge result changes every time   something is merged into master. Retesting on every commit to master   is computationally expensive and means you are more frequently waiting   for test results.p blockquote  pThanksp

Negative 1834 pJavascript arrays used to be just objects with some special syntax, but JIT engines can optimize the array to behave like a true array with O1 access rather than Olog n access. I am currently writing a   cpu intensive loop where I need to a certain I get O1 access rather than Olog n. But the problem is that I may need to do array [5231]  obj1 right after its created but the array will eventually be filled. I am worried that such behaviour may trick the JIT to thinking that I am using it as a sparse array and thus I wouldnt get O1 access time I require. My question is that is there ways I can tell or at least hint the javascript engine that I want a true arrayp  pIn particular, do I need to initialize the array with values first Like fill all of it with reference to a dummy object my array will only contain references to objects of same prototype or undefined. Would just set the array.length  6000 be enough p  pEDIT based on a hrefhttpjsperf.comsparsearrayvtruearray relnofollowhttpjsperf.comsparsearrayvtruearraya, it seems filling the array beforehand is a good idea. p

Negative 1834 pIm trying to extract a dates components from a given string and Ive discovered that strongdatevecstrong suits my needs perfectly. However I have two problems that Ill discuss based on the following examplep  precodedateString  12.03.09 1718  This is some random date as a string dateFormat  dd.mm.yy HHSS  This is the format of the date date  datevec dateString, dateFormat  Create a vector with each component being part of a date year,month,day etc. codepre  pExecuting  this example revealed to me two issuesp  ol listrongdatevecstrong scrambles my daymonthyear part of the date and spins it around so it becomes yearmonthdate. This does NOT correspond to my strongdateFormatstrong. It makes sense though since timewise year  month  day  hour  minute  second  ... but the question is Is this always happening or is it something that I did wrongli lipstrongdatevecstrong produces a 1x6 vector with the last component being the seconds in my date. I have discovered this completely by accident since my final goal is to havep  precode[year,moth,day,hour,minute]  datevec... codepre  pbut my initial experiments see code at the beginning showed me that the seconds are ALWAYS stored no matter what my format is. If seconds for example are not present in my strongdateStringstrong, the value is simply set to 0. The question here is again as in issue 1 Am I doing something wrong or is this how datevec always misbihavespli ol  pThe a hrefhttpde.mathworks.comhelpmatlabrefdatevec.html relnofollowdocumentationa is somewhat unclear here. It does say that strongdatevecstrong supports up to milliseconds as a fraction of seconds like HHSSMM.FFF with FFF being the milliseconds part however it does not tell at least I was unable to find it anything about the order in the resulting vector.p  pThe order is not too much of a big deal as long as this sort of behaviour is constant. Id like however to be able to tell strongdatevecstrong to store only those components of a date that I have chosen. For those of you who are going to say Its just one more number, whats the big deal I can simply reply It becomes a great deal memorywise if you have millions of dates that you have to work with. in my case  data mining.p  pThanksp

The spinner directive isnt getting triggered when this new row is added.p  pNote that this jquery code is not in any controller, service, factory, or any other angular thing.p  pSo, how do I get the angular directive to pick up the new rowp  pI suspect that the emcorrectem answer is to make the whole page be controlled by angular, including the add row button, but I dont have the time to do that.

Negative 1834 pThis is a situation that happens quite often in my codes. Say I have a function codedostha,bcode, that, only for the sake of this example, simply calculates codeabcode, with codea,bcode either 1D codenumpycode arrays or scalars. In many occasions, I need the function to broadcast the operation, so that if both codea,bcode are 1D arrays, the result will be a 2D array. An example of what I mean followsp  precodedosth1,2 gt 3 dosth[1,2],0 gt array[1, 2] dosth0,[3,4] gt array[3, 4] dosth[1,2],[3,4] gt array[[4, 5], [5, 6]] codepre  pThis is a bit similar to how a numpy codeufunccode behaves.

The first question is is this the right way to do this inputoutput casting Is there any reason to not use a decorator to deal with a situation like this Is there any guideline on the matterp  pMoreover, the more complicated calculation, here mocked by the addition, often fails badly if codeacode or codebcode are numpy arrays with 2D,3D shape for example. I say badly in the sense that the point where the calculation fails is not obvious, or may change with time in different revisions of the code, and it is hard to see the connection between the error and the wrong input shape. I think it is then NOT advisable to put the complicated calculation in a codetryexceptcode block following python a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2glossary.htmltermeafp relnofollowEAFPa. In this case, is it correct to check the shape of the 2 arrays at the beginning of the function Is there any alternative Is there a numpy function that allows at the same time to convert the input to a numpy array, and also check that the input is compatible with a certain number of dimensions, something like codeasarraywithdimarr,ndim5codep

Ive worked on an app in the member center, and Ive also got an iTunes Connect account connected to this same Apple ID.pli lipRight now Im working on an app Super Marvel App as part of a team lets call it Team Marvel My Apple ID has been added to that team, as an Admin. So when I go into the member center, the MC asks me which organisation I want to choose my own, or Team Marvel.pli lipHowever, the agent for this team was unable to add my Apple ID in iTunes Connect, as it belongs to an existing dev account. So what we did was to add a plussuffixed version of my email, in this case ashmarvelashmenon.com.pli lipProblem is, Im the developer for the team, not the agent hes nontech, so any archiving, submission, validation, and exporting comes from my XCode. But when I try and submitvalidate my archived app, it tells me that my organization does not have permission to submit this application. not sure if this is important, but the name of the organisation it displays during this error is not the same as the name of the development team that I selected earlier in the submission process.pli lipI tried adding the ashmarvelashmenon.com address as one of the Apple ID accounts in XCode, but it tells me Error Fetching Developer Info. I presume this is because the account in question is not an actual Apple Dev account.pli ol  pFor now Ive worked around the process by submitting via Application Loader, but it feels like Im hacking the system somewhat. p  pQUESTION 1  Is there a proper way of doing this that Im missing out Gut instinct tells me that this hackesque workaround is going to bite me in the backend later on.p  pQUESTION 2  Is the Team Marvel agent required to do all iTunes Connect submissions himself This seems like a very counterintuitive approach considering this is Apple were talking about.p  pAny assistance is much appreciated.

Negative 1834 pI am new to win32 programming.I am intercepting an application from my application using codeMadHookccode, by hooking codedllcode funceions.

But no one resolved my problem.p  pOne of the ways i tried to determine control is that, i searched the methods called exactly before  codeExtTextOutWcode of each control, hooked them and assigned a control name for the coming codeExtTextOutWcode method.But some methods are same for more than one control, which causes the problem to differentiate between controls. Also doing this seems too lengthy and not able to get different method for each control  which calls before codeExtTextOutWcode of that control.I searched for these methods in codeUser32.dllcode and codeGDI32.dllcode.  So does anyone has a different  suggestion or correction in my way. Any help would be appreciated.  So can anyone help me out to differentiate controls. Thank you in advance.p

I shouldnt have to, I should be able to yum install git and get the version my cpanel comes with.p  pIn WHM I updated RPM database.. still no go..p  pI got my bare repo on my cpanel baremetal server, and can git push to it. The problem I have is I get a 500 internal server error after the first checkout, which puts all the files in my publichtml through the postreceive hook. I edited index.php just by 1 edit, saved it, and the error is gone and the site operates as normal. I dont know why I am getting an internal error, maybe a bug with this old Git version when checking out from the bare repop  pI always have this issue with yum, it never has or installs the version its supposed to for my cpanel version.p  pI have spent a few hours on this already, and hoping someone can guide me in the right direction.

When i click the button, the button first gets selected by the OS the border is becoming blue and only after i click a second time on the exact same button itll become green the style that im giving it via setStyle. However, the selected property becomes true on the first click and false on the second click, which means i click once on the button and it gets a blue border and selected  true, if i click on it a second time it becomes green and selected  false and if i click on it a third time it becomes normal again but selected will be true again.  I find it to be really strange that the first click on a button changes the selected variable correctly but not the style. Why is this happening and how can i avoid that ive to select the button first before i can click itp

The fixture creates a directory which is then used by the test and Im getting IOErrors. p  pFrom the output, it looks like the two failing parametrized tests are either being collected andor being run multiple times.

Negative 1834 pI have read through a lot of articles about Doctrines inheritance options now, but I still couldnt find a solution for my problemp  pBasically, I have a symfony2 bundle which serves as the base of my application, containing the user entity and things like that.

Basically, this keeps me from being able to run the project for any reason, the option to do so is just grayed out. The code works in a new project I create as a mobile app, but for some reason Titanium doesnt recognize the pulled project as something that can be run. Ive confirmed that the deployment targets in the pulled project are checked for Android and Mobile Web, is there something else I should be looking for, or a command I need to enterp

Negative 1834 pMy question is related to math and how one should go about calculating financial mathematical equations with Java with emphasis on Android development. According to Philip Barker the author of Java Methods for Financial Engineering developers should take special care with regards to strongaccuracystrong and strongerrorstrong when dealing with strongnumerical approximationsstrong. Below is a quote from his book which should make things clearer for this discussion.p  blockquote   pSince we are largely dealing with numeric approximations or iterative   convergence to a desired solution the discussion of accuracy and error   are important.p      pIn the decimal system irrational e.g. 2 and transcendental e.g.    numbers cannot have a precise representation, most rational   numbers are also not represented precisely, in decimal notation.   Representing 13 as a decimal can be approximated by 0.3 or   0.333333333 or some other arbitrarily large representation. Providing a decimal value for 13, means representing the division as a floating   point number.p blockquote  pIn order to make things simpler for development my question is the followingp  p1 Given that I know what my calculations should expect with regards to strongscalestrong and strongprecisionstrong are there any drawbacks from making all calculations within my app with BigDecimal type I want to keep things simple and this seems to work as far as financial equations are concerned e.g. ROI, Compound Interest Rate, etc. What do you thinkp  p2 I noticed that the core Java library does not provide methods for calculating BigDecimals when the answer falls within the irrational or transcendental spectrum. This is probably because Sun or Oracle decided to leave the burden of proof to the developer to extend in its own application what is considered to be acceptable in terms of numerical accuracy. However, I discovered a BigBecimal library that seems to implement most of the methods omitted in the core library related to irrational and transcendental numbers. Its a library found at the Cornell University Library you can get there by clicking a hrefhttparxiv.orgabs0908.3030v2 relnofollowherea or here for the a hrefhttparxiv.orgsrc0908.3030v2anc relnofollowfilesa. Would this library allow me to calculate financial equations without having to cast outside BigDecimal type except at the result toStringp  pAny feedback on these questions would be highly appreciated. p  p His book is a great read if you are interested in Java Financial Math. p  p If you are unfamiliar with scale amp precision you can read a great answer here.p

Negative 1834 pMy question is very simple, and is related to the Multipeer Connectivity Framework in iOS. O know that I can have multiple sessions running on my device.

This means that device B is a peer connected to a session with device A and also has its own session and establishes a connection with device C.p  pThanks.p

The result is a bit random depending on the constellation of the call stack, from cant call a number to randomly calling a previous function on the stack again. the gettop is definitely 0 before and after all calls.p  pSo How can I backup the current stack and restore it afterwards as lua does it itself in a C  Lua  C constellationp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 1834 pDuring editing of the grid, I need to validate the data input and if it fails validation, I need to revert the bad data back to an unchanged state so it wont get saved akin to using the

the alert, they could still just click the Save button and it would save that way, with the incorrect data.p  pTo combat this, youll see I try to set the e.values and e.model to 0, but it is not

We want to have a dynamically scalable cluster without a point of failure in the sense of a domain master or a hibernatesearch master and have configured for this with standalone nodes without a domain. To elect the HS master we are using the jgroups backend and to replicate the hibernatesearch data we are using the infinispan provider with a codefilestorecode to persist data between restarts. p  pI got this up and running, rather quickly and was quite excited since it seems like a robust and scalable scenario, but I am somewhat hesitant to put this configuration into production, since the jgroups backend has been dubbed experimental and in some forums extremely experimental. What is the current status of the backend Are people currently using it in production What can we do to minimize risk using this configuration p  pAlso, does anyone have experience with using infinispan together with hibernatesearch in this constellation Most of the settings regarding codereplicatedcachecode were simply reused from existing examples, if anyone has some tips or advice regarding these settings, e.g will it scale with indexes 50GB I would be most thankful for any feedback or experience with similar scenarios. p  pThe configuration was mostly put together using reference material from herep  ul lia hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatestablesearchreferenceenUShtmlsingle relnofollowhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatestablesearchreferenceenUShtmlsingleali lia hrefhttpsforum.hibernate.orgviewtopic.phpf9ampt1035437 relnofollowhttpsforum.hibernate.orgviewtopic.phpf9ampt1035437ali ul  pThe detailed steps we have taken are included below. p  ul liAs a basis, we taken and extended the codestandalonehafull.xmlcode li liconfigure jgroups to use the TCP stack li lirun TCPPING instead of MPing we are planning to have this running in a cloud context where multicastudp causes issues  we may move to JDBCPing to make this more flexible at some point.li liwe run with the following SystemProperties per node nameport changes per node, of courseli ul  pSystemproperties p  precodeltsystempropertiesgt            ltproperty namejboss.node.name valuenode2 gt      ltproperty namejboss.socket.binding.portoffset value889 gt      lt Automatic master election via JGroups, requires Infinispan directory provider gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.default.worker.backend valuejgroupsgt    lt Enable clusterreplicated index, but the default configuration does not enable any     form of permanent persistence for the index, we do this with cachecontainerfilestore below  gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.default.directoryprovider valueinfinispan gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.infinispan.chunksize value300000000 gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.reader.strategy valueshared gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.worker.execution valuesync gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.default.optimizer.operationlimit.max    value10000gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.default.optimizer.transactionlimit.max    value1000gt    lt Use CacheManager defined in WildFly configuration file, e.g., standalone.xml gt    ltproperty namehibernate.search.infinispan.cachemanagerjndiname valuejavajbossinfinispancontainerhibernatesearchgt ltsystempropertiesgt      codepre  pWe have defined the following codeltcachecontainergtcode for infinispanp  precodelt BEGIN HIBERNATE INFINISPAN CACHE gt ltcachecontainer namehibernatesearch jndinamejavajbossinfinispancontainerhibernatesearch startEAGERgt     lttransport locktimeout330000gt     ltreplicatedcache nameLuceneIndexesMetadata startEAGER modeSYNC remotetimeout330000gt         ltlocking stripingfalse acquiretimeout330000 concurrencylevel500gt         lttransaction modeNONEgt         lteviction strategyNONE maxentries1gt         ltexpiration maxidle1gt         ltstatetransfer enabledtrue timeout480000gt         ltfilestore preloadtrue purgefalse passivationfalse relativetojboss.home.dir path..namespacesmcinfinispanfilestoregt             ltwritebehindgt         ltfilestoregt         ltindexing indexNONEgt     ltreplicatedcachegt     ltreplicatedcache nameLuceneIndexesData startEAGER modeSYNC remotetimeout25000gt         ltlocking stripingfalse acquiretimeout330000 concurrencylevel500gt         lttransaction modeNONEgt         lteviction strategyNONE maxentries1gt         ltexpiration maxidle1gt         ltstatetransfer enabledtrue timeout480000gt        ltfilestore preloadtrue purgefalse passivationfalse relativetojboss.home.dir path..namespacesmcinfinispanfilestoregt             ltwritebehindgt         ltfilestoregt         ltindexing indexNONEgt     ltreplicatedcachegt     ltreplicatedcache nameLuceneIndexesLocking startEAGER modeSYNC remotetimeout25000gt         ltlocking stripingfalse acquiretimeout330000 concurrencylevel500gt         lttransaction modeNONEgt         lteviction strategyNONE maxentries1gt         ltexpiration maxidle1gt         ltstatetransfer enabledtrue timeout480000gt         ltindexing indexNONEgt     ltreplicatedcachegt ltcachecontainergt lt END HIBERNATE INFINISPAN CACHE gt codepre  pIt is my understanding and it seems to work in practice with my tests that infinispan will serialize its data to the configured codeltfilestoregtcode and the data is then retained between node restarts. Even some catastrophic tests e.g. codekill 9 ltjbosspidgtcode have shown to recover the index cleanly when the node comes back up. During the offline period, another node takes over as the master and the cluster runs smoothly. p

Negative 1834 pIm trying to get two separate bars of horizontal buttons on one line to work well with different window sizes, though Im having a bit of trouble getting the behaviour I want.p  pBasically, a table does do the formatting correctly, in that you can have two cells, set one to align right, and as long as there is enough space for everything on one line, everything is fine. brHowever, as soon as the width is too small, the buttons group together in the cells. I prefer the bootstrap way of sending them to a new line.p  pThe downside of the bootstrap way though, is it doesnt seem to support dynamic widths, so youll notice my right aligned things being sent to the bottom before they reach the left aligned things. Im wanting the best of both worlds, so itll act like the table but then send to a new line.p  pIs this possible with bootstrap Ive read that apparently you cant do dynamic widths, though this seems like it should be fairly standard.p  pa hrefhttptinyurl.comnb229hh relnofollowAn example herea bootstrap at the top, table at the bottom, I did the site in PHP so apologies about the html missing line breaks if you would like that code to build on, Ill sort it out for you, but you get an idea of what Im after.p

Negative 1834 pI am creating some audio cues for scripts, and keep running into the same problemp  pHuman perception is logarithmic.  If I want to cut a range of sounds into 10 equal parts, I cant just subtract the lowest pitch from the highest pitch and divide by 10. Those steps will not be perceptually accurate.p  pSo, when dealing with a function that gives output in the 2020000 range kHz, is there a basic mathematical function that emreasonably approximatesem a conversion of these numbers to their perceptual equivalents  while still mapping in the 2020000 rangep  pExamplep  pI am dealing with a beep command which takes kHz as a range.p  pI know from my own system testing that the functional range for this command on the system being tested is 38 to 9900Hz.p  pSo if I was creating an audio countdown to go through 100 items, I would divide 990038  100 into a 98.62Hz range per item.  If I were to create an audio countdown, I would simply create a sequence of beeps starting at max range, decreasing 98.62Hz per beep.p  pBut this doesnt sound perceptually accurate.  Most time is spent in highsounding frequencies.  Not enough time is spent in lowsounding frequencies.p  pI did manage to fix this for my white noise generator, but I cant apply that same kind of fix to an audio countdown. Mainly because there is quite the leeway for mistakes in a  white noise generator. In that instance, I simply divided by Hz by 10. But I did so randomly. It gave me the desired effect, but not any kind of consistent mapping functionp  precode        if  RANDOM[1,10] gt 6 set BEEPFREQUENCYTEMPFLOOR[EVAL[BEEPFREQUENCYTEMP  10]]          if  RANDOM[1,10] gt 9 set BEEPFREQUENCYTEMPFLOOR[EVAL[BEEPFREQUENCYTEMP  10]]          if  RANDOM[1,10] gt 8 set BEEPFREQUENCYTEMPFLOOR[EVAL[BEEPFREQUENCYTEMP  10]] codepre  pCan you tell I dont even know how to ask my questionp

Negative 1834 pI would like to see Log4j output in the console only when a given test has failed.  I can add a console appender to Log4j during test execution, but that causes all log entries, whether for failing or passing tests, to be written to the console.  What I would like to see is something like this p  precode[junit] Testcase testInequality took 0 sec [junit] Testcase testEquality took 0 sec [junit]     FAILED [junit] expectedlt1gt but waslt2gt [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError expectedlt1gt but waslt2gt [junit]     at com.company.package.TestNeedsLogOutput.testEquality TestNeedsLogOutput.java80 [junit]log4j Some text that was logged in the target class before the last test case failed. codepre  pIn this example, testInequality would write logs, but they would not be output to the console since the test passed, whereas testEqualitys log lines would be written to the console, since it failed.  This seems like it should be simple to configure, but searches only return information on how to assert log output as part of a test.  I am using log4j 1.2 and junit 4.11, configuring both with Ant and procedural code.p
Negative 1834 pI need to checkout an SVN repository on a Ubuntu 14.04 machine that has a local CNTLM proxy with NTLMv2authentication installed that connects me to my universitys proxy server.
