Positive 330 pHas anyone encountered this beforep  pI have local intranet sites, some of which are passwordprotected http. p  pSo, for example, we have a link to a hrefhttp192.168.0.105pwdprotectedarea relnofollowhttp192.168.0.105pwdprotectedareaa . However, in safari on iOS, this link will NOT open in a new tab, ONLY in same window. When I open link in new tabwindow, it just goes to a totally blank screen with no urlip address in the location bar. Does anyone know why this is so, and how to work around It seems that normal not protected links open fine in new tabs, just the password protected ones will not.p  pThanksp

Positive 330 pWould it be possible to use Safari Content Blockers to block only certain types of ads, such as layer or video ads I am a CocoaTouch dev and although I know some HTMLCSSJS, what I dont know is what rules I could use to achieve this, as I lack a level of proficiency in web development that would allow me to intuit what elements I need to block. So my question is thus 1. Is there a way to do this that would work across most sites 2. If not, can I block it in a sitespecific way by observing how a site serves its ads in the source code, and if so how likely are such rules to break often 3. If the answer to any of the above is yes, could you provide an examplep

Positive 330 pIve been running a WebSocket Service for some months now. It basicly transfers a pile of messages from one end to the other.p  pThe service itself runs great, atleast with Chrome, Firefox and IE10. The problem begins when I start using Safari.p  pIn the case where my JavaScript Client sends data to the Server, the Client  checks the bufferedAmount value of the WebSocket to see if the buffer has gone  empty.

Positive 330 pI coded my flexbox in Google Chrome Version 44.0.2403.157 and the code works as intended. There is one column with a height of 100, this column has two rows header and content. The header has a height defined by the content, the content row has its height determined by the height of the browser minus the height of the head row. However when I tested my code in  Safari Version 8.0.2 10600.2.5, it was displayed as one row and two columns. I tried adding width 100 to the row, to force there to only be one column however this did not work.

Negative 330 pIm having the same problem that a couple of others have had with getting the correct behavior in a web app on an orientation change, and there doesnt seem to be an obvious solution  Ive seen this question asked a couple of times on Stack Overflow and no ones yet been able to answer it.p  pWhen I start the app in portrait mode, it works fine. Then I rotate into landscape and its scaled up.  To get it to scale correctly for the landscape mode I have to double tap on something twice, first to zoom all the way in the normal double tap behavior and again to zoom all the way out again, the normal double tap behavior.  When it zooms out, it zooms out to the correct NEW scale for landscape mode.p  pSwitching back to portrait seems to work more consistently that is, it handles the zoom so that the scale is correct when the orientation changes back to portrait.p  pI am trying to figure out if this is a bug or if this is  something that can be fixed with Javascriptp  pWith the viewport meta content, I am setting the initialscale to 1.0 and I am NOT setting minimum or maximum scale nor do I want to.  I am setting the width to devicewidth.p  pAny ideas I know a lot of people would be grateful to have a solution as it seems to be a persistent problem.p  pThank youp

Negative 330 pIn my app, Im working with Simfile and Notechart objects.

The problem Im facing is how to enforce that a Notechart always has a parent Simfile Right now, Im able to create a Notechart independently of a Simfile, and add it to the Simfile dictionary without making the needed reference from Notechart  Simfile.p  pIdeally, the best resolution would be an Add method in Simfile that only can be called from within Notecharts constructors, but I dont think thats possible.p  pI want to say that this is a common problem, but its the first time in practice Ive come across it, and Im not sure what its called.p

Negative 330 pIm using memcache for caching obviously which is great. But Im also using it as a crossrequestprocess data store. For instance I have a web chat on one of my pages and I use memcache to store the list of online users in it. Works great but it bothers me that if I have to flush the whole memcache server for whatever reason I loose the online list. I also use it to keep record of views for some content I then periodically update the actual rows in the DB, and if I clear the cache I loose all data about views from the last write to db.p  pSo what Im asking is this what should I use instead of memcache for this kind of things It needs to be fast and preferably store its data in memory. I think some noSQL product would be a good fit here, but Ive no idea which one. Id like to use something that I could use for other use cases in the future, analytics come to mind what are users searching the most for instance.p  pIm using PHP so it has to have good bindings for it.p

Im trying to understand how ASP MVC handles AJAX functionality and, after reading some of the tutorials on the ASP website, it appears they implement AJAX functionality very differently.

This makes implementing AJAX really simple and quite fun.  Can ASP.NET MVC return a javascript responsep
Negative 330 pI was wondering what would be the best configuration of view controllers and views for an app that Ive been planning out. Conceptually, the way I would like to lay out the app is with an initial loaderbrowser view, likely with document thumbnails. When a user chooses to open one, a new view comes up that forms the main documentediting mode. The user can also choose to bring up a third view that contains an alternative documentediting mode.p  pI suppose this is very much like the way the Pages for iPad works, with first a row of document thumbnails to choose from, then the main word processing view, and accessible from a popover a third page setup view. Document browser view, and two document editing views.p  pNow, I can think of, and have been playing around with a few different setups, but in each case I can see problems that Ill be running into later. So really, Im looking for advice on a configuration that you think would keep things as neat and manageable as possible.p  pI hope this is not too open a question, and I would very much appreciate any answer.p  pThank you,p

Negative 330 pThe apps that I build frequently have social media service requirements e.g.p  ol liTwitterli libit.lyli liFacebookli ol  pFor most of these services, I need to have an API key of some sort. Im trying to work out the best way of including these API keys in the application binary. The desired level of security depends on the possible attacks that can be conducted by malicious attackers.p  h1Twitterh1  ul liI have an xAuthenabled key and secret. Both need to be used by the iPhone app.li ul  h2Fallout from attackh2  ul liMalicious users could post twitter status updates masquerading as coming from my app. There is no twitter account to hijack and start posting status updates on.li ul  h1bit.lyh1  ul liI have a username, password and API key.li liTo login to the website and access analytics, the username and password are required.li liTo create links via the API, only the username and API key are required by my iPhone apps. The password will not be in the app in any form.li ul  h2Fallout from attackh2  ul liMalicious users could create links on my bit.ly account. They would need to do a separate attack to bruteforce or otherwise gain the password to login to the account.li ul  pFor both of those services, the potential for harm doesnt seem too great. But for other services, it could be much worse.p  pI can just define the API credentials as strings in the header or inline in the code, but then its vulnerable to someone using strongstringsstrong on the application to see whats in it.p  pI could then start doing silly concatenation  xoring in the code to recreate the API key in memory, and the attacker would have to do a bit more work to recover any keys in the binary. My concern with that is that Im not a cryptographer and would create an embarrassingly weak form of obfuscation there.p  pWhat better suggestions do people havep

Negative 330 pWe have the following situationp  pAn ATL COM server outofproc, EXE which hosts COM objects with connection points. These objects live inside a single exe process and they fire events using the Fire methods so that other processes for example a .NET GUI application in a different process, the client of the ATL EXE server can catch these events and react accordingly.p  pCurrently, we have a .NET application Windows Forms which is the client of the ATL server. When started double clicked it attaches some delegates event handlers to the COM objects events connection points hosted in the ATL server. Each time an event is fired from the ATL server, the .NET client usually displays some info in the main Window or opens a new Window for the user to interact with.  This solution is based on the following article a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBCOMcominterop.aspxConnectionPoints relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBCOMcominterop.aspxConnectionPointsa COM.NET event handling.p  pThe above scenario assumes that the user had actually doubleclicked the .NET client exe prior to the firing of the events, that is  Opened the .NET application explicitly. In case the .NET client is not opened instantiated the fired event is lost  no client handled it.p  pWe want the following situation p  pWhen an event is fired from the ATL server, a Window should immediately appear popup for the user to interact with for example fill an email text box amp press Ok, without the need to start the .NET client explicitly prior to everything. This way, the user will be notified about each event and can interactively react to it.p  pWe looked at the option to host the .NET client app as a dll inside the ATL server, but Ive read that displaying GUI from an ATL EXE is a big NONO any GUI, not just .NET GUI like WinForms or WPF.p  pIs this possible when the server amp client run in two different processes and the client is not yet running  Did anyone run into the same problem was it solved and how...p  pThanks p  pOmrip  pIs there a solution for thisp

Negative 330 pHere is the task I would like my JavaScript code from different files to be compressed and concatenated into one file that is going to be used on a web page. The problem is that Im pretty lazy  and using some command line tools like, for instance, Apache Ant  YUICompressor each time I add a new line of code doesnt look attractive too me. Replacing uncompressed versions with a compressed final script before release is not a great option as well.p  pI know that such IDE as Eclipse allow to build project automatically after each update so it is possible to use already mentioned Apache Ant and YUICompressor in a build scenario to reach my goal. However Eclipse is too geeky for me, its not that I cant figure out how to use it, I just dont feel comfortable using it. Maybe someone knows a good alternative for Mac OSp  pPS. I hope I dont sound too capricious  , after all having convenient tools is rather important for a programmer.p
Negative 330 pemIn shortem I want to allowforbid the execution of Java methods depending on certain conditions. What is the best available solutionmechanismtechniquep  pemLong questionem, via an admittedly dumb examplep  pSay I have several methods in a vehicle controller, like codevoid openWindowWindow wcode, codevoid openRoofcode, codevoid keepSpeeddouble speedKmhcode. If it rains, the codeopenRoofcode should not be called, and we want to put in place a mechanism to ensure it. Similarly, if the speed is below 60 kmh, codekeepSpeedcode is forbidden, like codeopenWindowcode if it rains a lot or if the speed if above code100 kmhcode.p  pSince accessing the rainspeed sensors requires several lines of code, and these conditions are used everywhere, I dont want to use use assertions or conditions in the body of the methods, but Id rather make them easily used by domain developers. Besides, Id like the security concern to be separated from the actual logic of opening the windows, etc. More complex, custom conditions should be easy to configure too.p  pFor instance, Id like to have thisp  precodeForbidIfdefaultrain openWindow ForbidIfdefaultspeedBelow60 keepSpeed ForbidIfdefaultspeedAbove100, customrainsALot openWindow codepre  pIf it helps, this application is a Springpowered clientserver application.p

Negative 330 pIs there an easy way to fake an unknown size multidimension array using a flat one I have an application where 90 of the uses of the array would be easierquicker without using recursion, and a single requirement that needs to add some depth to the array. The only way I can think of it would be keeping a running list of start indexes and end indexes, where the 1D array would look like thisp  precode[0]  1 [1]  2 [2]  3 [3]  4 [4]  5 codepre  p...and the startend lists would look like thisp  precodeStart      End        [0]  1    [0]  2 [1]  3    [1]  4 codepre  pWhich would represent a multidimension array that looks like thisp  precode[0]  1 [1]  [0]  2       [1]  3 [2]  [0]  4       [1]  5 codepre  pThis would work with more than 2 dimensions, but at that point Im having trouble figuring out how to determine which depth I was at given an index in the original 1D array and the startend lists. Im also having a hard time figuring out what search terms to use to look for this type of thing. Any general guidanceideas would be appreciated. Thanks.p  pEdit  To give some context, this is for supporting nested transactions in a command pattern implementation. The 1D array contains commands, and the artificial depths are only there to give names to each transaction. Since the transactions will be used sparingly, it seems apparent that quickly going through a small list of ints would be faster than recursively going through a multidimensional array of commands, and checking at each index whether or not there was a single command or an array of commands within.p

Negative 330 pFor a research purpose, I developed and app to control a wheeled mobile robot using the gyro and the accelerometer of an iPhone. The robot has a IP address, and I control it by sending messages through a socket. Since the robot has to be controlled from anywhere in the world, I mounted a camera on top of it. I tried to stream the video from the camera using the http live streaming protocol and vlc, but the latency is too high 1530sec to properly control it.p  pNow, vlc has the possibility to stream over udp or http, but the point is how do I decode the stream on the iPhone How should I treat the data coming into the socket in order to visualize them as a continuous live video p

Negative 330 pIm trying to research literature for algorithms to solve a particular problem, but I dont think I quite know the right search term to describe what Im looking for. p  pThe goal is to have a queryable rules database, where each rule is specified as tuple conditions mdash some mandatory, some optional.

Each rule is scored by the numbertimesweight of optional conditions matched and the list is sorted thereby.p  pSo for an example, if I were using this to write a roommatematching service, the rules would be something like p  precodealice   mandatory   nightowl  no, smoker  no, pets lt 2 ,            optional   pets  0   bob     mandatory   nightowl  yes, pets  0 ,            optional  smoker  no  charlie   mandatory   musician  no ,              optional  nightowl  yes, pets lt 2   codepre  pand the query would be p  precode nightowl  no, pets  1, smoker  no, musician  no  codepre  preturning p  precode charlie  11 mandatory matched, 12 optional matched,   alice    33 mandatory matched, 01 optional matched  codepre  pI know this is a problem that must have been solved many times in computer science already, but I dont know what keywords to search for. Its not a emdistance functionem, because some conditions are discrete truefalse rejectors whereas others are optional or have linear scores. Its not empattern matchingem or emfuzzy matchingem, because those seem to refer mostly to strings and graphs. Its not a emproduction systemem or emrules engineem like the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRetealgorithm relnofollowRete algorithma, because it doesnt draw IFTHEN inferences from rules, nor does it remember facts from one call to the next.  p  pWhat emisem it calledp  pI only need research or descriptions of algorithms, not actual implementations.

Negative 330 pI am learning more advanced OO tactics for javascript coming from a C background and am wondering about how to or if its even a good idea to implement prototype based validation. For instance when an object or function requires one of its parameters to satisfy a certain interface, you could check its interface like so,p  precodevar Interface  function Interfacei     var satisfied  function t, i        for var key in i           if typeof t  object              return false                    if key in t ampamp typeof t[key]  i[key]              return false                        return true      this.satisfiedBy  function t  return satisfiedt, i     the interface var interfacePoint2D  new Interface     x number,     y number     see if it satisfies var satisfied  interfacePoint2D.satisfiedBysomeObject  codepre  pI came up with this strategy to validate an object by its interface only, ignoring the internal implementation of the object.p  pAlternatively say you are using prototypebased inheritance, should you or should not validate parameters based on their prototype functions I understand that youd use a prototype to implement default functionality whereas an interface doesnt specify any default functionality. Sometimes the object you are passing into a function might ineedi certain default functionality in order for that function to work. Is it better to only validate against an interface, or should you ever validate against a prototype, and if so, whats the best way to do itp  pbEDITb  I am providing some more context as to why I am asking this,p  pSay for instance in online game design games written mostly in javascript. There are 2 main reasons I am interested in validation within this context,p  p1 Providing a strong public API for modding the game if desiredp  p2 Preventing or atleast discouraging greatly potential cheaters  p  pWhich requires a balance between customizability and abuse. Specifically one situation would be in designing physics engine where objects in the game react to gravity. In a realistic system, users shouldnt be able to add objects to the system that do not react to gravity. The system has a function that expresses the global effect of gravity at any given pointp  precodefunction getGravityAtx, y         return acceleration due to gravity at this point  codepre  pAnd objects which react have a method that uses this to update their accelerationp  precodefunction update        this.acceleration  getGravitythis.position   codepre  pThe minimum thing to do might be to ensure that any object added to the system has an update method, but you still arent ensuring that the update method really is intended to react to gravity. If only objects that inherit from a prototypical update method are allowed, then you know at least to some degree everything in the system reacts realistically. p

Negative 330 pI have 1 mysql database named A with one table named USERS that holds a users ID, amp NAME, amp EMAIL. p  pOn the site I am working on I have it set up so that when the user registers it automatically sets up a new seperate mysql database for each user which is named after their ID from the USERS table. So there are an unknown number of databases depending on how many people register but the names of the databases are easy 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D amp so on. On each database I have 2 tables which are also named after the ID number from the USERS table FRIENDS amp CARS. So 1FRIENDS, 2FRIENDS, 3FRIENDS, 4FRIENDS amp 1CARS, 2CARS, 3CARS, 4CARS amp so on. The FRIENDS table allows each user to make a list of other users on the site. The CARS field holds information on the toy cars each user collects. I am trying to write the PHP code to take A users FRIENDS amp show all of their friends cars using UNION to connect all of the users friends CARS tables amp order them by the date that each user added the info on each car but I cant figure out how to do it.p  pI can get it to work if I know exactly what friends a user has for example if a person is friends with user 1 amp user 3 amp I code it like this it will work.p  precodedbc  mysqliconnect DBHOST, DBUSER, DBPASSWORD OR die  Could not connect to MySQL  . mysqliconnecterror   query  SELECT  FROM 1D.1CARS UNION SELECT  FROM 3D.3CARS   ORDER BY dateentered DESC   if result1  mysqliquerydbc, query   while row  mysqlifetcharrayresult1   codepre  pBut I wont know which people a user will choose to be friends with ahead of time nor do I want to type all of that out each time so I need to use some sort of variable amp a loop or something to take the list each persons is friends with amp do the UNION.

Negative 330 pI have a JSFIceFaces application where there is a screen divided into 3 sections. Search fields, a grid and some details fields below. Currently if I enter some data into the search fields and click on a Search button  the grid shows the results and a certain method is called that puts the first result records details into the backing beans of the details fields below the grid. This shows that there is no problem with the way I put data into the details fields.p  pHowever I have a gridclicklistener method as well that would like to change the detail fields according to the selection. After the click the same method gets called with the correct parameters that works well if invoked after the click on the Search button. The data is updated in the backing beans but the changes are not rendered even if I click the refresh button in the browser.p  pI found that if I click on the search button, the dataupdatingmethod gets called from codeInvokeApplicationPhase.executecode. When I get to this line after the grid click then it is from the codeApplyRequestValuesPhasecode.p  pDo you have any ideas what could make this difference and how to get this workp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI can clearly see the updated value in the backing bean but it is not reflected on screen at all, even after F5.p

Negative 330 pWere working on an application thats going to serve thousands of users daily 90 of them will be active during the working hours, using the system constantly during their workday. The main purpose of the system is to query multiple databases and combine the information from the databases into a single response to the user. Depending on the user input, our query load could be around 500 queries per second for a system with 1000 users. 80 of those queries are read queries. p  pNow, I did some profiling using the SQL Server Profiler tool and I get on average 300 logical reads for the read queries I did not bother with the write queries yet. That would amount to 150k logical reads per second for 1k users. Full production system is expected to have 10k users. p  pHow do I estimate actual read requirement on the storage for those databases I am pretty sure that actual physical reads will amount to much less than that, but how do I estimate that Of course, I cant do an actual run in the production environment as the production environment is not there yet, and I need to tell the hardware guys how much IOPS were going to need for the system so that they know what to buy.p  pI tried the HP sizing tool suggested in the previous answers, but it only suggests HP products, without actual performance estimates. Any insight is appreciated.p  pEDIT Main readonly dataset where most of the queries will go is a couple of gigs order of magnitude 4gigs on the disk. This will probably significantly affect the logical vs physical reads. Any insight how to get this ratiop

Negative 330 pId like to create a motion blur effect by rendering and additively blending moving objects at multiple points in their trajectory over the course of a frame. p  pI was thinking that the calculation for determining the draw location could be performed in a vertex shader. It seems to me, though, that I might need to employ the use of a geometry shader if I want to avoid passing in the geometry for each render. p  pWhat is my best course of action I am deciding between p  ol liAssembling the vertex data for each subframe manually and passing it to the GPU each time I wouldnt need to have a vertex program if I do thisli liSend the geometry along with velocity values. I can calculate the intermediate position in a vertex shader, though Im not certain about how to specify that a certain velocity value is assigned to certain groups of primitives. I will need to send in the same vertices once for each subframe render because the vertex shader cannot create new vertices.li liUse a geometry shader to produce all geometry for all subframes. I should be able to get all of the subframes without passing any data back and forth during the entire rendering process. li ol  pThe balance I want to strike here is I want a minimum of redundant datapassing while supporting as much hardware as reasonably possible. It seems like I should be able to use a Vertex Buffer Object to store my geometry data, and just pass a few uniforms to send velocity data to the vertex shader on each render. Does that work Also a VBO buffer is persistent, so for best performance I should be stepping in and modifying geometry data on an asneeded basis, correct p  pAnother potential problem I dont know how to deal with is that I want to draw my intermediate positions accurately by interpolating the translation and rotation that rigid objects traverse over a frame, rather than just interpolating the resultant vertex positions alone. The difference here is be that a spinning object will leave a curved streak. p  pIs there some way I can prevent having to issue a call for each separate dynamic rigid object Maybe I could use a generic vertex attribute to send in my velocity It would be somewhat redundant because I could have an object with 100 vertices with the same velocity data, but at least then my shader can get a stream of this data this way.p  pIt seems to me that there might not be too much to gain by performing the vertex transformations on the GPU I would have to pass in a velocity vector, an angular velocity scalar, and a center of mass vector as vertex attributes. It seems like a big waste of bandwidth. However, I can use that data for a potentially large number of samples subframe renders. p  pIve gotten by for a very long time using the OpenGL Immediate Mode but I want to do things right this time around. p  pUPDATE See extended comment discussion for the direction this has taken. Im now fairly certain that multiple samples will not produce a good result because of the strobe light effect At some velocities Ill need to use blur for performance reasons. In that case I need to accumulate blurred subframes rendering subframes and then blurring it will still leave artifacts. p

The question I have is what is the possible way to secure it within my WEB server, i.e. do not allow it do something like taking my passwords from local file system and send it somewhere to internet.p  pIs there some moreorless standard approach for thisp  pIm aware this can be done by customer SecurityManager provided I have implemented my WEB server from scratch , but i have no idea what would be the way to plug in security manager into existing WEB server engine  for example Tomcat.p

Negative 330 pWhen I bind to the all event and some property changes, i receive 2 events the changeproperty event and the plain change event. Since I always catch the property specific event , I dont need the plain one. I cannot bind to all change individually because i dont know beforehand all the properties that might get added to the model. So is there any way to stay with model.bindall, ... and somehow get rid of the change event p  pP.S. I know I can filter the name in the handler, I am asking if there is a more standard way of filtering or declaring events in models, that I dont know of.p

Negative 330 pI have designed the WCF service with operation contracts that can store data in a SQL server database. The operation contract takes parameters such as dataID, dataDescrip., dataType and byte array data content. The byte array is originally a file that has to be stored in the database.p  pI used the WCF service within a web form client application where the WCF service is referenced to send the data, but when I send the file 40 kb as a byte array with other parameters it returns bad request 400 error. When I send files less than 30KB or so, the data is successfully stored in DB, no error is returned.p  pI believe this has to do with large data streaming and changing the size to larger numbers in web.config. I have tried to change the size in the client application web config, but no luck. Also changing the encoding tag to MTOM that returns mismatch client and service binding.

This flashing is very annoying because it happens every time. p  pIs there maybe any workaround i can prevent the internet explorer from showing the original selectmenu before the jquery one is loadedp  pThank you for any helpp  pRuvenp

Negative 330 pI am not sure where to start.  I am looking for the best way to have an image that will follow a browser scrollbar down a webpage or across the bottom of a webpage page.  If, for example you have scrolled halfway down a webpage page, an imagearrow will point to the scrollbar. As you travel down or across the page, the image will travel as well.  I am not looking for scripts that have an image following a cursor since this doesnt take into account that a user might be using scroll wheel on a mouse, in which case, the cursor is not moving even though the page is.p  pThanks for your help.   p
Negative 330 pI am looking for some guidance with working with Wordpress. My company has recently decided to move to using Wordpress as our main development platform. I am used to doing OOP and I see that Wordpress has support for it which is great. I do have a few questions I was hoping some seasoned Wordpress developers could answer.p  p1.We have designers that like to modify the layout of elements coming from a plugin. What is the best way to handle this from a plugin update standpoint so that there changes dont get overwritten in future updates We will probably be making most of our own plugins and will be using the custom content types for them when available.p  p2.From a client perspective what is the best way to handle urls for custom content ex. Faqs plugin so that designers can handle layout and client can easily enter them. My initial thought was to create a cutom post type and make the slug through it. However, the drawback to this is that they cannot change the url from the pages section and add any custom content before the call to the plugin content. My second thought was to just use short codes but the downfall to that is client can accidentally remove it. Is there another way that I am missing or an even better wayp  pIf anyone has any other tipssuggestions please feel free to leave them. Also any links to great articlesresources to working with Wordpress is appreciated.p
Negative 330 pI am currently working on a Java plugin for Netbeans 6.9.1 using the Apache POI api for interfacing with Microsoft documents that has two functions, the first takes data from a properties text file and creates an excel spreadsheet.xlsx containing that data, and the second part takes text from a spreadsheet and adds it to a properties text file. p  pWhen I run the code in the debugger both of the functions work great. The files get created and edited as they are supposed to, but I ran into problems when I created the NBM from the project and installed the plugin. The import from .xlsx to .txt does not do change the contents of the text file. I have checked variables at various times in the code to make sure theres nothing wrong with them there and everything was as it should. The export .txt to .xlsx works fine in the plugin, so Im not sure exactly whats going on. When I start the import it goes through the steps, but nothing ever gets changed or written to the final files.p  pIm pretty new to Netbeans so Im not sure if there is a major difference from debugger to the actual plugin that is affecting how the program acts. Any helpp

Negative 330 pI will explain my problem statement with the following illustration.p  pI have 4 machines, each running instances of my application which uses lucene for search. This means lucene indices have been created individually on all 4 machines and have been used internally for search using lucene in the respective instances.p  pNow, I am putting a server on top of all these 4 machines, so that its search feature could aggregate all the results from individual instances and give me a result. Hope the problem statement is clear.p  pNow the question, I am aware solr can read indices created by lucene. Does this hold good even for a distributed search Can solr just distribute the search over individually created lucene indicesp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. If this is not possible, I ll just have to go and rewrite the individual instances with solr and create indices suitable for distributed search.p

But answers using a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryunittest.html relnofollowunittesta, a hrefhttppytest.orglatest relnofollowpytesta are welcome too. Also of course, general advice.p  pI think I get the basic concept but I lack practice in setting up emgoodem test. Im also struggling with how to layout the tests. emIm especially unsure on how to approach the case where I want to run a couple of test cases on different function of a moduleemp  pFor example I might have a module called codediceroller.pycode it contains a couple of function on simulating rolling dice, modify and test the results and so on. All functions for rolling dice should run trough the same tests do they return a list of integers, with the right amount of values, are the values in range, etc.. But some of those should also be run against some additional cases.p  pSo I got a subdir codetestcode and want to setup my testcode there. How do I approach thisp  precode a section of diceroller.py  def rolladicesides6   Return an integer x where x gt 1 lt sides   return random.randint1, sides  def rolldicesides6, count1   Return a list of integers most function except this   rolls  list   while count     rolls.appendrandom.randint1, sides     count  1   return rolls  def rollsomedicesides6, count1, times1   Return a list of list containing integers   somerolls  list   while times     somerolls.appendrolldicesides, count     times  1   return somerolls  def rollingdicesides6, count1   Yielding integers count times   while count     count  1     yield random.randint1, sides codepre  pstrongSmall updatestrongp  pSimeon Visser has a good point. But the code above where just functions too ad some context to my Questions, which just is emHow can I reuse test cases on different functionsemp  pI guess writing tests like codecheckxyzcode and then calling it from codetestacode and codetestbcode for example, is the easiest solution Or is this bad practicep  pThe solution from Rik Poggi seems to do exactly what is was trying to accomplish will play around with it right after typing this. But I kinda have the feeling it complicates things to much... probably not on the technical side but it comes as too much maybe.p

Negative 330 pWe have inherited an application Javabased, running on WebLogic 10.3.5 that makes extensive use of JSTL XML tags, and particularly of XPath selectors.  Quickly we have run into some performance problems due to the implementation of these tags and how the DTMManager class is first resolved then instantiated by the DTMManager.newInstance method.p  pThe DTMManager class name lookup issue has been previously a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6340802javaxpathapachejaxpimplementationperformancedocumenteda and was solved by setting the codecom.sun.org.apache.xml.dtm.DTMManagercode system property.p  pHowever, once the class name has been found, the codecom.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.dtm.ObjectFactory.findProviderClasscode method asks the not null class loader to load the class definition and it never caches the result  In a WebLogic environment, this operation is very expensive and eats a significant portion of our response times.p  pIs there a reason why the class definition is never cached  And is there a way to avoid the class definition to be loaded every timep  pThanks a bunch.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Similar behaviour can be observed for the codecom.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.dv.DTDDVFactorycode class  the ClassLoader reloads the class definition on every call to codeDTDDVFactory.newInstancecode.p
Negative 330 pIm writing a web application using Python and the Flask microframework. The application will support several languages, and Im now trying to decide how to write i18n enabled html templates. My template engine is Jinja2 though it is early enough in my project that I can switch to something else if necessary.p  pLet me start by showing an example portion of a template with gettext tagsp  precode if error ltdiv classerrorgt error ltdivgt endif  lth1gt Hello, World lth1gt codepre  pIn this template there are two kinds of strings that the application will need to know how to  translatep  ol lidynamic strings that in the context of the template will only be known at runtime the codeerrorcode stringli listatic strings that are known at any time the codeHello, Worldcode stringli ol  pThe first case is easy to handle. The string is passed to the gettext engine at runtime to obtain the translated version. No issues there.p  pWhile the second case can be handled in the same way, my impression is that theres got to be a more efficient way to handle these static strings. None of the documentation I read for gettext, Babel or Jinja2 mention anything about optimizing the translation of static strings that will have to be searched and located every time the template needs to be rendered.p  pAn approach that I think makes a lot of sense is to prerender each template into a set of language specific subtemplates, where each subtemplate has the static strings resolved, leaving only the dynamic text sections for gettext to handle at runtime.p  pSo, for example, if I wanted to support English and Spanish, my template above would be processed offline by some tool that will generate two subtemplates that will get written to a template cachep  ptemplateen.htmlp  precode if error ltdiv classerrorgt error ltdivgt endif  lth1gtHello, Worldlth1gt codepre  ptemplatees.htmlp  precode if error ltdiv classerrorgt error ltdivgt endif  lth1gtHola, Mundolth1gt codepre  pThen at runtime the template engine needs to check if a specific subtemplate for the requested locale is available in the cache, and if one is found then rendering will be much faster.p  pAre there any frameworks, tools, template engines, etc. that implement something like thisp  pOr are there any other ways to avoid the overhead of searching the translation database for the same little snippets of text over and over againp

Negative 330 pWe have a project that has been in development for years. The project is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 and has been since it was first made public over 10 years ago. The source code is made available via SVN for free.p  pRecently, an exdeveloper has decided to sell some modifications of the software, which he is free and clear to do so under the GNU GPL license, provided that the license file remains in his code and hes not prohibiting its distribution, both of which hes currently doing. p  pWe as the development team of the main project have confronted him about his violations of the GNU GPL license and he has agreed to readd the license file and relicense the original work under the GNU GPL license. p  pBut now, he is saying that he can create a .patch file or a .diff file of his modifications so his exclusive users can patch them into our code. Hes not releasing the source, but his modifications will make modifications to the original code. Again, if he offers just the .diff or .patch files, he feels he can go back to his license which basically says you cant redistribute this at all, you must register its use, basically, a lot of things that are against the GNU GPL license.p  pSo, my ultimate question is If a user of a piece of software creates a modification in the form of a .diff or .patch file or heck, installation script that does the same thing aimed to modify the original source code of a piece of software released under GNU GPL v2 license, is this against the terms of the licensep  pI have done some searching and Im led to believe that if his modifications even use a library or method from our software, he has to release his under GNU GPL. Ive emailed GNU for some explanation but have gotten no response. Any ideas from herep  pThank you for your assistance.p

Negative 330 pI have a console application made in C that works great in Terminal. But I need to port it to iPhone. So I need to make an GUI that respond imitating a Terminal. So basically I need to input data and get the output printfs from the console application. This C application makes a connection to a Router so Im not sure if theres a way to implement a GUI maybe a textfield that recieves output from the console app. The thing is, iphone doesnt have terminal, the C app compiles good in Xcode and it gets loaded to the iPhone too. But sinces there is no terminal.. it just prints some stuff like Connecting.. but after connection is done... it disconnects. I guess because it doesnt find any terminal to interact with. Ive tried MobileTerminal but that app only runs on jailbroken iphones so I dont want that.p  pAny suggestions p

Negative 330 pAs a beginner programmer, just now learning the basics of OOP, Ive run into many issues with the basic inclusion structure of my practice programs. Ive been teaching myself programming using various written and online resources. But, heres my problem well, one of them...p  pOn one hand, emI understand the importance of abstraction, encapsulation, and having a low degree of coupling between classesem, yet, on the other hand, emIve been struggling tremendously with structuring my program and designing my classes in a way that allows different classes in different files to know about each otherem.p  pOf course, this is a major problem of mine that has resulted in sloppy, hackish code which only works the way I want it to after I throw every basic principal OOP out the window and start filling my code with globals variables, forward declarations of everything everywhere, and making class members public. p  pemSimply putem My programming is a mess... C is my first programming language, and even when I try my best to designwrite in an object orient way, I end up with an ugly mess of files, including everything in nearly every file, and an odd mix of procedural and OOP spaghetti code that rarely worksp  pIm a selfproclaimed programming novice, and I accept that it takes time to learn how to structure a program, but Im nearly at wits end I know that my problem stems from the fact that I know a stronglittle bitstrong about OOP. I know that I want to write independent classes that handle a single task. But at the same time, I dont understand how to properly alert each class of the existence of the other parts of the program. Its a little bit like knowing what kinds of food you should eat but not knowing how to use a fork...p  pThats my problem in a nutshell. And to further follow up with some more specific questions that I havep  ul lipIn C multifile project, is it normalneeded to put the main function inside a class of its own Or is it the standard thing to leave your main in the global scopepli lipIn previous, procedural programs that Ive written in C, it wasnt uncommon to have a constants variables or defines in the global scope, at the top of main.cpp file. For example, maybe the dimensions of the screen or other useful information would be defined at the start of the program. What happens in OOP Is this practice to be avoided completely Or do I make a MAIN.H file and include it in every other header in the project I have no idea what to do about this...pli lipWhen writing my first medium size practice OOP program, my work came to a screeching halt when I began trying to write a StateMachine class. It was my intention to have the StateMachine class contain all the possible screen states that the program would use. However, an issue arose where my StateMachine class seemed to not be aware of some of my other State classes, even though they were all included. Ive seen people do forward declarations of classes before, is that necessary Should I be spamming forward declarations of classes all over the place or is that a code smellpli lipFinally, does the order of include and forward declaration commands matterpli ul  pI know this is probably a super basic question, but its something that has been giving me a really hard time in my transition from singlefile procedural c beginner programs to multifile OOP programming. Is there some general rule of thumb for structuring your programs so that everything just works Ive been using include guards, so is there any reason why one cant just include every header in every source file Should I have a common.h file that is included in each header file for each classp  pI really appreciate any helpadvice that the community can give me. I know that this is a simple, yet important hurdle for me to pass before I can begin developing my OOP skills. Ive been trying to drill into my brain the importance of keeping classes separate from each other to the point where Im not sure how to really set up my classesfiles in a way that allows them to really interact with each other Thanks so much for the helpp

Negative 330 pSorry if the title is poor, I could not think of a better one.p  pI saw a little console memory game program written in C recently  that inspired me just for the heck of it to replicate in C mainly for  a certian aspect of this program that stuck out to me. p  pIt intrigued me when I saw how the console window had sort of a static effect for example if you flipped a cardp  precodeConsole Screen Before Card Flip        1 2 3  1    2    3     Flip Which Card x,y  codepre  pLets say I entered code1,1code a possible output of the program may have beenp  precodeConsole Screen After Card Flip    1 2 3   1 9    2     3     Flip Which Card x,y  codepre  pThis is actually what insipred me to replicate the program, in all honesty thats my only goal is to replicate this sort of static console. My guess is that the author of this program just clears the screen after every user input and reprints the updated matrix in this case the unmasked value of   1,1.p  pSo I decided to write a sort of setup screen for the initialization of a similar programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      int flips, x, y     do      printfGame Setup     printfntGrid Size x     printfnGrid Size y      printfnAmount of Flips 0 is Unlimited n     scanfd, ampx     systemcls  whilex lt 0 do      printfGame Setup     printfnGrid Sizex d, x     printfntGrid Sizey     printfnAmount of Flips 0 is Unlmited n     scanfd, ampy     systemcls  whiley lt 0 do      printfGame Setup     printfnGrid Sizex d, x     printfnGrid Sizey d, y     printfntAmount of Flips 0 is Unlmitedn     scanfd, ampflips     systemcls  whileflips lt 0 ifflips printfBeginning d by d Memory Game with Unlimited Flips..., x ,y else printfBeginning d by d Memory Game with d Flips..., x, y, flips  return 0  codepre  pIt works as expected but I feel like there is probably a better way to achieve this same effect, doing it this way would increase the length of my code exponentially, and cant be efficient. Not only that but by using this method the UI is lousy at best, I think it would be a lot better if I could somehow just move the flashing input cursor appropriately p  pFor Example p  precodeGame Setup Grid Size x  Grid Size y  ... codepre  pThen I would enter code1code for example and the cursor would simply move down to the next areap  precodeGame Setup Grid Sizex 1 Grid Sizey  ... codepre  pI was thinking of accomplishing the latter with the codencode specifier with codeprintfcode somehow although I am not quite sure if that is even possible I know very little about codencode.p  pSo is there a better way of doing this more efficiently And if so is there a way to move the cursor as described above How would YOU do something like thisp  pThis whole concept just really peaked my curiosity.p

Negative 330 pIm using ListView to show some data from mysql table, and its populated with SimpleAdapter. I added onItemClickListener, to be able to open new activity when user press some item on list.

Negative 330 pI have two tables with a codemasterchildcode relation which have few million records. Im using a typed dataset generated by visual studio.

Now the problem with the child table is that it still brings the million rows on application startup.p  pWhat is the solution of still using the generated codeDataSetcode and limit the child codeDataGridViewcode from loading all data  The first solution that comes in my mind is to manually implement the codeSqlDataAdaptercode data filling for the child rows in an event for row selectin changed in master codeDataGridViewcode.

Negative 330 pI had a PC connected to a PLC Mitsubishi Q Series via a USB2RS232 cable. The cable was plugged into the PC side, which was then plugged into a Serial cable and then into the PLC. I hade the baud rate set to 19200 and everything worked fine. My problem was that every now and then the PC would blue screen on me. When I checked through the dump files the problem seemed to be related to the driver for the USB2RS232 cable ftdi. I update to the latest driver but still bluescreening Pc was running Windows 7.p  pAnyway I replaced the PC with another which had a dedicated RS232 port. Now I keep getting communication issues which is indicated by the response by the PLC. Just by chance I lowered the baud rate down to 9600 on both the PC and PLC. The issue seems to have gone away.p  pMy question is why would removing the USB2RS232 cable cause me to have to slow down the communication Both devices can communicate at speeds greater than 19200 and I would have thought going from serial port PC to serial port PLC with a serial cable would be better.p  pEDIT Problem maybe solved  still testingp  pThanks to some of the input from you guys, I may have solved the problem. Here are the following points I went by to get the speed back up to 19200 when using straight RS232 to RS232.p  ul liEven though no noise was detected on the equipment, a shielded cable was used.li liThe PC program would wait 100ms between sending data to the PLC. I read somewehere that 100ms is a good approx for PLC scan time.li ul

There is a separate class which handles the loading and storing of sprite images this is where the problem seems to be.

When the program actually does load the program displays properly, however, the key listener stops working.  I am using NetBeans 7.3 if that helps.p  precodepackage breakout  import javax.swing. import java.awt. import java.awt.event. import java.awt.image.BufferedImage import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Random  public class GamePanel extends JPanel implements Runnable      private Paddle paddle     private Breakout boRef     private Circle ball     private Graphics2D g2d, bufferedGraphics     private BufferedImage buffer     private Images images     private final int WIDTH  Constants.WINDOWWIDTH     private final int HEIGHT  Constants.WINDOWHEIGHT     private ArrayListltBlockgt blockList     private int numBlocks, blockRows, blockCols, ballXInc, ballYInc, blockPadding     private int totalWidth, blockX, blockY     private Thread ballThread     private boolean started, gameOver     private String gameOverText     private Random rand      public GamePanel Breakout ref           boRef  ref         images  new Images  lt Problem          numBlocks  12         blockRows  4         blockCols  3         blockList  new ArrayListltgt         blockY  100         blockPadding  5         totalWidth   blockCols  Block.WIDTH     blockCols  1   blockPadding          blockX   WIDTH  2    totalWidth  2   60         setupBlocks          rand  new Random                 gameOverText           started  false         gameOver  false          buffer  new BufferedImage WIDTH, HEIGHT, BufferedImage.TYPEINTRGB          bufferedGraphics  buffer.createGraphics         bufferedGraphics.setBackground Color.LIGHTGRAY           ball  new Circle 250, 593, 6          ball.setColor Color.BLUE          ballThread  new Thread this          ballXInc  1         ballYInc  1          paddle  new Paddle this, 200, 600, 100, 15, Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK           addKeyListener new KeyHandler          setLayout new BorderLayout          setFocusable true          requestFocus         System.out.println END        private void setupBlocks      int xPos  Block.WIDTH  blockPadding, yPos  Block.HEIGHT  blockPadding     int xInc  1, yInc  1      for int y  0 y lt blockRows y, yInc           for int x  0 x lt blockCols x, xInc               blockList.add new Block xPos  xInc  blockX, yPos  yInc  blockY                     xInc  1            Override public void paintComponent Graphics g           super.paintComponent g          g2d  Graphics2Dg          bufferedGraphics.clearRect 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT         System.out.println HELLO           bufferedGraphics.drawImage images.getImage, 100, 100, images.getImage.getWidth, images.getImage.getHeight, null  lt DrawSprite          if gameOver               for Block b  blockList                   b.draw bufferedGraphics                            ball.draw bufferedGraphics              paddle.draw bufferedGraphics           else               bufferedGraphics.setFont new Font Times New Roman, Font.BOLD, 48               bufferedGraphics.drawString gameOverText, WIDTH  2  130, HEIGHT  2                    g2d.drawImage buffer, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT, null            private class KeyHandler extends KeyAdapter          Override public void keyPressed KeyEvent e               if paddle.x  10 gt 10 ampamp e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKLEFT                   paddle.x  10                  if started                       ball.setX ball.getX  10                                else if paddle.x  paddle.width  20 lt WIDTH ampamp e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKRIGHT                   paddle.x  10                  if started                       ball.setX ball.getX  10                                             if e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKSPACE                   if started                       ballThread.start                     started  true                  else if gameOver                       restart                                             repaint                   package breakout  import java.awt.image.BufferedImage import javax.imageio.ImageIO import java.io.File import java.awt.image.Raster import java.awt.image.WritableRaster import java.awt.Rectangle import java.io.IOException  public class Images      private BufferedImage texture, tex     private BufferedImage [] images     private String meshPath  texturetextures.png     private Raster imgRaster     private WritableRaster imgWritableRaster      public static final int TEXWIDTH  16     public static final int TEXHEIGHT  8      public Images          images  new BufferedImage[1]          try              texture  ImageIO.read new File meshPath   lt Seems to be the problem          catch IOException e               System.out.println e.getMessage                    imgRaster  texture.getData new Rectangle TEXWIDTH  2, 0, TEXWIDTH, TEXHEIGHT           imgWritableRaster  imgRaster.createCompatibleWritableRaster          tex  new BufferedImage texture.getColorModel, imgWritableRaster, false, null          images[0]  tex           public BufferedImage getImage          return images[0]       codepre

Negative 330 pIve been using a TCP sockets tutorial for C, and came across the following line p  blockquote   pBefore we begin, you will need to include winsock.h and link libws232.a to your project in order to use the API that are necessary for TCPIP. If this is not possible, use LoadLibrary to load ws232.dll at runtime, or some similar method.p blockquote  pAfter some research, I found a source that claimed this could be done with the following two lines p  precodeinclude ltwinsock.hgt pragma commentlib, ws232.lib codepre  pHowever, one of the two seem to not be working I assume that it would be the second line, as the first is fairly straightforward.

Using the JW Players functionality I have determined how to have the link appear when the video is complete but only in standard view.

Negative 330 pMy class and I are working on a programming assignment for Java that tests running times for different sorting algorithms.  We generate text files that store different amounts of randomly generated integers.  The sizes are 100, 1000, 10 000, 100 000, 1 000 000.  I am able to run the sorting algorithms correctly on these files but have no idea how to do the next step.p  pWe need to create or modify these text files so only 5 of the random ints are out of place.  I cannot just move the last 5 because it has to be evenly distributed.  Also, he said when disordering these files, that an integer that has been moved out of place should not be moved again to prevent the occurrence of it being moved back where it was.  Anyone have any ideas how I would do this  Thanks.p

But, my concern is that if production environment has 2 nodes running the app, how it is going to sync the changes that made to this filep  pI think in that case, there will 2 copies of yadayada.yml file and changes made from user will save it to one of them and the other will still have old structure.p  pWhat is the best practice to handle this kind of situationsp  pPS Content of the yaml is not something that would be good to keep it in database.p  pthanks in advance, cheersp

Negative 330 pWe have an isolated Java application deployed on two processors primarily for failover in case the primary processor goes down. Lets call them processor A and B. The architecture currently has a set of processes running on A and an Oracle database running on both A and B with streams configured to keep them in sync. In the event that A goes down, processes are started on B to take over and use the database on B. p  pThen when A comes back up we want the system as a whole to automatically restore to a state where the processes are running on A and the database moves back into an A being primary and B a slave for failover. We mostly have this working where we have defined our own logic to stop the database on B, essentially wipe the database on A and restore it from B then reestablish streams. However, although this works for us 99 of the time we still find synchronization bugs here and there.p  pIt seems to me that were reinventing the wheel here though, but are we I feel like there should be a standard method for database clustering where database nodes can come and go where it works out the syncronization for us Am I being naive or does this already exist, and what buzzwords describe this kind of architecture Is this what a multi master is Does a multimaster auto synchronize when one or the other goes down for a period of timep

Negative 330 pI would like to findimplement a c hopefully stl compatible stream that supports multiple writing points. What I mean with multiple writing points is easy to explain with the following example. Lets say that you want to generate a source code file say in java language.

The new class needs to go to the bottom, but the import needs to go to the top.p  pI am aware that I could solve this problem other ways. I think it will be cool if I can solve it with some stl stream pattern though.p  pIs boost tee with some filtering something that could workp  pNote the location could be based on analyzing the input or specifying dedicated type in this case I could have check if the string starts with import or I to writep  precodestream ltlt Importjava.applet. codepre  pwhere Import is a class that is accordingly serialized.p  pHow you feel  is this something that could worth the effortp

Negative 330 pI have a situation where I create a tap interface on linux using C program. I can configure an ipv6 address on this interface as well using the ioctl command SIOCSIFADDR. and it gets set correctly. But wat i want is to configure only LinkLocal address thats wat i set by above SIOCSIFADDR. and then Let the kernel do the global address allocation through SLAAC procedure. but I only succeed in setting the Linklocal address. If I do a service network restart I can see the eth0 interface going UP and i can see the Router Solicitation requests too. but nothing for the interface that i bring up through programming.  Is it possible to create an interface and let kernel manage its ipv6 interfaces itself.p

However, I have a small part of the application separated from the webapp that is running locally alongside the application server, and that application is authenticated using the linux user mechanism.

The problem is with authorization  I need the identify the user running the localhost requests. Any idea how can I achieve thisp

Negative 330 pHi I have been searching for the answer to this quite long. I want to know things under the hood regarding when memory will be taken up by my code.p  pEx.  int myVar p  ol liDoes this code already take up memory by memory i mean the stack  and initially in .NET I have noticed that this line will have a default value of ZERO0. li liBut what does the variable really store the value ZERO or an address to where the value ZERO0 is stored li ol  pAlso from what I understand about reference type is that when i write this line of codep  pMyClass myObj  declare onlyp  pmyObj  new MyClass create instancep  pI want to know what happens under the hood. Are my assumptions correct That myObj will reside at the stack and myObj is capable of storing address. and at my creating an instance the object is created at the heap and the address of that object is passed to the myObj variable.p  pThe thing is, I want to know if what is more efficientmemorywise and performancewise between the two below.p  pCode 1  int myVar   myVar  FunctionThatReturnsAnInteger  Console.WriteLinemyVarp  pCodep  pConsole.WriteLineFunctionThatReturnsAnIntegerp  pI want a good explanation for this and analogy is quite handy.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 330 pI had pushed a project from linux to bitbucked and then cloned it on windows. Turns out there were two symlinks, which appeared as textfiles on windows.

Negative 330 pI am new at building rpms. I have my own project which I want to build an rpm for. The issue is that most of the documentation assumes that you already have a tarball of your source. I understand how to construct a tarball, but I guess I dont know if I need to follow any specific structure. What I have right now is a bunch of source files with some configuration files and a Makefile that I want to package as an rpm and have the rpm extract these files into a specific location on the machine. p  pIt seems unclear to me what the build and install options do and where they are executed. My impression is that they are executed on the machine creating the rpm and they are used to generate any binary files. My impression is that pre, post, preun, and postun are executed on the machine before and after installs and uninstalls.p  pSo I guess there are a few questions buried in this. First, what sort of structure should I follow for tarring up my files How do I get these files delivered to a certain directory upon installation My project is not meant to deliver any binaries, but only source and build files.p  pThanks for all of the helpp

Negative 330 pI am doing a thermodynamic simulation on a double dimension array. The array is 1024x1024. The while loop iterates through a specified amount of times or until goodTempChange is false. goodTempChange is set true or false based on the change in temperature of a block being greater than a defined EPSILON value. If every block in the array is below that value, then the plate is in stasis. The program works, I have no problems with the code, my problem is that the serial code is absolutely blowing the openmp code out of the water. I dont know why. I have tried removing everything except the average calculation which is just the average of the 4 blocks up, down, left, right around your desired square and still it is getting destroyed by the serial code. Ive never done openmp before and I looked up some things online to do what I have. I have the variables within critical regions in the most efficient way I could see possible, I have no race conditions. I really dont see what is wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 330 pIve an Ektron C web forms application that Im setting up for multilingual capability.  So far, all Ektron settings seem good as per documentation for displaying pages in French.  However, when I select the language by passing langtype1036 French locale ID on the querystring, an Error 500 is raised BTW, Ive enabled detailed error message reporting in web.config as well as IIS and I still get that 500.  p  pAfter much Googling, I havent found any indication of why the problem occurs.  So, Im thinking, easy enough to debug, right  Ive placed in the following code at every relevant application or page event handler I can think of.  Examplep  pglobal.asaxp  precodevoid ApplicationEndRequestobject sender, EventArgs e  Context.Response.WriteApplicationEndRequest  codepre  pFrom a page or masterpagep  precodevoid PageInitobject sender, EventArgs e  Context.Response.WritePageInit  codepre  pWithin these events I would page in and take out... p  precodeResponse.End  codepre  p...to see what events were actually triggering prior to the exception hoping I could debug within one of them.  The 500 error is raised after the ApplicationEndRequest event and before PageInit or PagePreInit.p  pSo, Im wondering   Are there events Im overlooking for which I can debug the error   Is there another tactic I can take for debugging this rather than using events   Is this something probably happening within an Ektron DLL that Ive no ability to debugp  pAny help would be most appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 330 pIm stacking UIViews on top of each other as the user moves through the application, going backwards and forwards between different screens.

Negative 330 pOn our website the users can upload pictures. For every picture we create a row in the database with 2 fields the id and a 32 character unique code. We had like 200.000 pictures in the db and every picture was saved in a certain folder, for example www.site.comimg At the beginning we use to save picutes in this folder naming the pictures with the 32 unique character code. For example www.site.comimgafjf4lfn4nafjf4lfn4nafjf4lfn4nas.jpgp  pAfter the first 100.000 we start saving the picutes in the folder naming it with the id For example www.site.comimg123001.jpgp  pNow we decided to move all the pictures to Amazon S3.

Negative 330 pwe have a project written in Java.

Negative 330 pRecently Ive been reading Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby, and I noticed one of the best practices was to use accessor methods instead of directly grabbing the codeinstancevariablecode.

Negative 330 pI am have built an MSBuild project that has  the main .proj file with several Targets inside, several .targets files and several .rsp response files to run this project in several ways.  Such as Build, CleanBuildDeploy, CleanBuildTestDeploy.. You get the idea.p  pWhat I now want to do is take this MSBuild and run it in TFS scheduler after I pull the source code.  So the workflow should be 1.  Pull the source code in TFS 2.  Run MSBuild project in the scheduler so I might set up tasks to run hourly and nightly.p  pThe MSBuild will take care of Deploying to IIS, unless someone has a more efficient way of deploying after an hourly build.p  pHow can I accomplish this in TFSp  pThank youp
Negative 330 pIm trying to find the leap years and non leap years within a number range. The leap year and non leap years need to be put into separate arrays and I will be outputting them into a table later. Im pretty new to JavaScript and I suspect that my looping may be wrong, im not sure.p  pMy problem is that the nonleap year array is not getting all the numbers it needs. I enter 1900  2000 and the leap years seem to be alright, but the non leap year array only went up to 1930. Ive been trying to fix it for a while, but Ive had no luck.p  pEdit The codeforcode loops are there only for me to test the arrays.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN   httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt  lthtmlgt      ltheadgt         ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt          lttitlegtLeapYearslttitlegt          ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          lt[CDATA[                function calcLeapYear                   var beginYear  document.leapYears.firstYear.value                 var endYear  document.leapYears.secondYear.value                 var leapYrs  new Array                 var nonLeapYrs  new Array                  var ctr  0                 var ctr2  0                 while beginYear lt endYear                      if beginYear  4  0 ampamp beginYear  100  0  beginYear  400  0   Determines if year is a leap year or not                          leapYrs[ctr]  beginYear                         ctr                                          else                          nonLeapYrs[ctr2]  beginYear                         ctr2                                           beginYear                                   if leapYrs  0                         window.alertThere were no leap years within the range.                                       for i0iltleapYrs.lengthi    Testing Calculation                     document.writeleapYrs[i]  ltbrgt                                   document.writeltbrgt                  for i0iltleapYrs.lengthi                     document.writenonLeapYrs[i]  ltbrgt                                          ]]gt          ltscriptgt       ltheadgt       ltbodygt         ltform nameleapYearsgt              Beginning Year ltinput typetext namefirstYear gt End Year ltinput typetext namesecondYear gt              ltinput typebutton valueFind Leap Years onclickcalcLeapYear gt          ltformgt      ltbodygt   lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 330 pFor reasons of reusability, Im interested in finding a way to programmatically add text and custom UITextFields to a view in an efficient manner, similar to how you can combine strings using NSStrings stringWithFormat and then assign the result to a UILabels text attribute. Ideally, with 23 statements I could write text and include my UITextField Objects in a string, and get an automatically textwrapped, nicely formatted UIView that I can embed directly into my view. Basically, it would function like a UILabel with the ability to add UIView objects. For an example of the output this image would be a combination of both text and underlined UITextFieldsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVM9cL.png altenter image description here If this exists, it would allow me to reuse a single UITableViewCell subclass rather than having 56 xibs and 34 subclasses. Ive searched about 2 hours with no real luck for a preexisting solution, so has anyone ever encountered this problem before and used or released a library to handle this, or is there a simple solution Im overlookingp  pThank youp

Negative 330 pI had this working and now I cannot figure out what I did to make it not function the way I intend it to. When the program is called by the pyshell it asks the questions as it is supposed to but when the reply is given this is where it loses it mind. It was working and would call the function I have defined but now it will not do so.p  pI might just redefine the responses to use numbers instead of strings to make it easier and faster to complete the entries, but at the moment it is not working so there is no point in doing that until I can get it figured out.p  pThe error is in the coderuntimecode section, it is not calling the function as it should be, I might be missing something.

Negative 330 pI am trying to develop a game that imports the background images from a [100][100] matrix.  The matrix will hold int values to correlate to what should be drawn on the background.

Negative 330 pI wrote some code that works just fine to evaluate theta on its own with some test input. However, I would like to take this code and turn it into a function that I can call within another matlab file.

Negative 330 pI use this predicate code[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatANY lists.name LIKE[cd] , listName]code to compare the search string listName with an ordered codetomanycode relationship named codelistscode, however, there is a design requirement that I have to compare the search string listName against only the first element of the ordered set in the codetomanycode relationship, so I need something like the following pseudocode to be done using a codeCoreDatacode predicatebr code[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatlists.firstObject.name LIKE[cd] , listName]codep  pthank you in advancep  pp.s I know its possible to fetch the first object of that ordered codetomanycode relationship and then compare the codelistNamecode against that object, but i wont use this approach coz it will be an overhead for the app since this predicate is a part of a big loop. p

Negative 330 pemI will use Python in my code snippet and am referencing Django documentation, but this question is intended to be language agnosticemp  pFrom the Django tutorialp  blockquote   pA model is the single, definitive source of data about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youre storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.p blockquote  pIt goes on to sayp  blockquote   pIt should execute SQL statements as few times as possible, and it should optimize statements internally.p blockquote  pHow do we reconcile these two design philosophies To explore the situation, let us assume that we have a table representing profiles. We also have a function codegetprofileprofileidcode in our data model which does the followingp  ul liretrieves the row from the databaseli liperforms some computation to generate additional propertiesli lireturns this processed record as the Canonical Profile Representationli ul  pNext, we find we also need a codegetprofileslistofprofileidscode function. The DRY principle, as I understand it, would mandate implementation along the lines ofp  precodefunction getprofileslistofprofileids     profiles  []     for profileid in listofprofileids         profiles.appendgetprofileprofileid     return profiles codepre  pIf our list of codeprofileidcodes is long, we are now performing many individual database queries. Is this not horribly inefficient, as compared to a function which performs a single database query for codeprofileid in id1, id2, id3code and then performing the same computations on each rowp  pHow does one reconcile DRY with keeping execution efficientp

I structure goes something like this. I have the AspNetUsers table that connected to another table, allusers. The table, allusers, then connects to the tables companies.employees, and employees.employees. p  pEmployee.employees contains all internal employees, and companies.employees contains all external employees. When I add a new employee to the system, if its an external employee, it is spread across 2 tables companies.companies, and companies.employees. The companies table houses the company name, and some other information. The employees table houses all the employees information. p  pIf it is an internal employee that Im adding their information is spread out through 10 different tables, including an employees table, a phone number table, an email table, previous employment, etc. p  pOn my add employee page, Im wanting to basically have a dropdown asking for the company, if they select our company one form is shown, that allows them to enter all the information for an employee, across all the tables. If they select another company, they get the generic form that allows them to enter the employees information.p  pIve been checking around, but havent really seen any easy method of accomplishing this.p

Negative 330 pIn a text editor Im working on in Qt 5.1.1 MinGW I realized that scrolling through the QFontComboBox adds about 40MB of RAM usage to the app. To test if the issue was local only to my text editor I created a bare bones application with just a QFontComboBox on a tool bar in a QMainWindow and the result is still the same. The applications starts off at 12MB and when I scroll through the list which is also a visually jerky experience about 40MB is added on. I decided to use Qt 5.2.1 VS2012 instead but this time almost 80MB of RAM was used up.

Negative 330 pI have just done some enhancement to a project I worked on a few years ago for a client and I am wondering what is the best way to get it back into SVN. It was in Visual Studio 2010 as an MCV 3 application with a lot of outdated libraries so I decided to create a new project in VS 2013 MVC 5 and copy across the code rather than try and update the old project.p  pNow I have the new solution with the enhancements can anybody advise me on the best way to get the new project into the old SVN trunkp

Negative 330 pI can use Integration Services to extract and transform data that is, for example, contained in a single type of fixed format record in an import flat file.

Negative 330 pFor a Silverlight and WPF app, I have a custom control that includes an codeObservableCollectioncode as a dependency property.  One element of that control, a Border, needs to change color depending on the composition of items in the codeObservableCollectioncode.  p  pFor example, lets say the collection is of animals, vegetables, and minerals and called codeObjectListcode.  If there is at least one animal, I want the border to be red if there are no animals but at least one vegetable, its green otherwise the collection has only minerals, so will appear as blue.p  pI created a converter that can take the collection and determine the color, so have a binding likep  precodeltBorder BackgroundBinding ObjectList,                       RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self,                       ConverterStaticResource MyColorConverter gt codepre  pThe challenge is that as items get addedremoved from codeObjectListcode I need to trigger reevaluation of the background color however, codeObjectListcode itself doesnt change.  I figure I have three options, but am unsure of which may be the best practicep  ol lipCreate a new collection each time an object is added or removed. That seems heavyhanded, but will result in codeObjectListcode being changed and so trigger the background update.pli lipCall codeUpdateTargetcode for the background property in the codeCollectionChangedcode callback for codeObjectListcode.

However, the only reason I had placed the gridView in a linear layout in the first place was in attempt to just not have the button disappear when having its androidlayoutbelow property to the gridView by setting its androidlayoutbelow to something else. The more accurate fix for what I wanted to do however, was to not have the gridViews width and height set to matchparent, which was the root cause behind why the button was disappearing. So, i set the gridViews height to wrap content, but that caused the grid to shrink to the point where each grid elements content was no longer visible. I found that the cause of that was  I was programmatically setting the width and height of the gridview to wrap its content, and then the width and height of the components inside by the width and height of the parent view. Realized that was quite cyclical which may be why the gridview was shrinking when I set it to wrap content. I then set the width and height of the grid Elements based on the dimensions of the screen, which fixed the size of the gridView. So everything pretty much works now. p  pHere is my new layout, if anyone is interested. p  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationvertical     androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidbackgrounddrawablepinfragmentbackground     toolscontextcom.lab125.vivaapp.MainActivityPlaceholderFragment gt       ltTextView         androidididsectionlabel         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent      gt      ltTextView         androidididaudioPINmarquee         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutmarginTop5dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom20dp         androidpaddingTop15dp         androidgravitycenter         androidtextSize15sp         androidtextStylebold     gt      ltGridView         androidididkeypad         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutbelowidaudioPINmarquee         androidlayoutmarginTop10dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom20dp         androidcolumnWidth90dp         androidgravitycenter         androidhorizontalSpacing5dip         androidverticalSpacing5dip         androidnumColumns3         androidstretchModecolumnWidth gt       ltButton          androidididstartverbtn         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutbelowidkeypad         androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue         androidlayoutmarginTop20dp         androidtextSize15sp         androidtextStylebold         androidtextstringStartVerButton         androidbackgrounddrawablebuttonstyle gt      lt     ltButton         androidididaudioplaybackbtn         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutbelowidkeypadwrapper         androidtextplay         androidtextSize15spgt     ltButtongt gt   ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre

E.g. what is the running sum of codes A and C in the time window [3, 5] This should produce the followingp  precodetime  countbef    diff    countaft  3        9             2       11   in time 3 there were 5 As and 4 Cs total 9 and 2 more Cs were added 4        9             0       9    the inventory change in time 4 did not affect A or C counts 5       11            3       8    in time 5 there were 5 As and 6 Cs total 11 and 3 As were removed codepre  pBTW, since the inventory change for time 4 did not result in any change in the quantities the query is supposed to report on, Ill accept answers where that row is missing, if that results in a simpler query.p  pDoes it make sense to do the above in SQL or should I do it programmatically p

Negative 330 pI am trying to set up a log in page on my ASP.NET MVC site.  I have a working database that stores all the data needed for my site.  When I started my site, I used the base template in visual studio because I wanted a basic layout so I could get right into displaying the data I needed and then I could go back later and change the styling.  This template created a log in page, which works but I need it to store the tables in my existing database, not a new database.  When I register a user it creates a database on my local db server named aspnetKUPLANDEV20140909071149.  I need it to store these tables in my KuPlan database on my local db server.  In my application, my connection string in my web.config file is named KuPlanEntities and my model is named KuPlan.edmx.  I cant figure out why it still creates this new database for the tables needed for authenticationsecurity and would appreciate any tipshelp that will help me store them in my current database.p  pThank you.p

I was wondering if there is a way to flush the streams buffer.p  pSo far this is some of the code I have only code that handles the cmd anyhowp  precodeProcess cmdHorch  new Process      StartInfo  new ProcessStartInfo              FileName  baseDir  donich.exe,         Arguments  startstring,         CreateNoWindow  true,         UseShellExecute  false,         ErrorDialog  false,         RedirectStandardInput  true,         RedirectStandardOutput  true,         RedirectStandardError  true,     ,     EnableRaisingEvents  true,     SynchronizingObject  this  cmdHorch.OutputDataReceived  s, ea gt this.findLine.AppendTextea.Data  Environment.NewLine  cmdHorch.Start cmdHorch.BeginOutputReadLine codepre  pIve tried puzzling around with cmdHorch.StandardOutput.BaseStream.Flush in order to force flush the stream but it failed miserably..

I am able to fill it with info just like a regular ListView, but ANY rightclick functionality with the ContextMenuStrip is just not working. p  pstrongAttempts at Solutionsstrong I HAVE assigned the ContextMenuStrip to the CustomListView control.

Negative 330 pI have 6 text boxes 2 for each type of bill that needs to be paid p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combLlnL.png altenter image description herep  pIf I type a number into one of the two it updates the other with the difference img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0ZYDs.png altenter image description herep  pThe textboxes within the panels will always add to the same sum, if you change the value it automatically changes the value of its adjacent textbox, but the RENT textboxes are different.p  pI am trying to make it so the RENT textboxes take the difference  2 between the 3 pairs of other textboxes. so if patti pays 100 more on the water bill than mike, mike has to pay that 100 back on the rent which also subtracts 100 off the rent from patti. p  pMy current a hrefhttppastebin.comhAeNvaeW relnofollowcodea results in thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG71fB.gif altenter image description herep  pAs you can see it doesnt update the rent textboxes properly.

So the viewpager manages two fragments where swiping left and right allows for the navigation among the two fragments.p  pheres my problem. in one of the fragments left i am trying to have a tabs interface for three tabs.  i kind of discover that the use of the viewpager inside the fragmentactivity kind of complicate things a bit for my implementation of a three tabs interface in the left fragment.p  pi searched around and not quite finding the exact answer like thisp  pthe code below shows calling new FragmentTabHostgetActivity and mTabHost.setupgetActivity, getChildFragmentManagerp  precodeOverride public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                          Bundle savedInstanceState      mTabHost  new FragmentTabHostgetActivity      mTabHost.setupgetActivity, getChildFragmentManager      mTabHost.addTabmTabHost.newTabSpecSample1.setIndicatorVideo,             PageSampleFragment.class, null     mTabHost.addTabmTabHost.newTabSpecSample2.setIndicatorPDF,             PageSampleFragment.class, null      return mTabHost  codepre  pthis code which i try to write from other sample code includes a layout item in the parameter of mTabHost.setupp  pp  precodeOverride public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                          Bundle savedInstanceState      mTabHost  new FragmentTabHostgetActivity      mTabHost.setupgetActivity, getChildFragmentManager, R.id.tabhostlinearlayoutdetail       mTabHost.addTabmTabHost.newTabSpecVideo.setIndicatorVideo,             PageSampleFragment.class, null     mTabHost.addTabmTabHost.newTabSpecPDF.setIndicatorPDF,             PageSampleFragment.class, null       return mTabHost  codepre  pi did some more digging and found the problem may lie in the onCreateView function of the left fragment where a view object is returned for the left fragment implementation.  Whats more, in some sample codes i see the function inside uses getActivity as a parameter while adding a R.id.somexmlitem as another parameter in that function call while other sample codes doesnt even use that parameter at all.  ltltlt SOME CODE p  pwhat i mean is, my use of a viewpager inside a fragmentactivity with two fragments where the left fragment implements a 3 tabs UI kind of confuses me on how to correctly implment the code for the left fragment.p  pi have put the code as follows for the left fragment.p  pBottom line question is.  How do I implement what I described correctly to work where i have a fragmentActivity with a viewpager for two fragments swipable to each where one of the fragment have a Tab UI.  My code show is for that fragment implementing the Tab UI.  p  pthanks in advance for helping.p  pUPDATE I was able to get it compile and run using the first snippet of code, but the problem now is that it doesnt show the UI of the fragment inside the Tab UI.  the first code snipper uses a setup function without the the parameter containing a layout item xml.p  pplease  advise p
Negative 330 pI have a Google Chrome Extension that is deployed via GPO to corporate windows machines and is hosted outside the chrome store. Its deployed firmwide to a few dozen different companies, each of which have a custom .crx file with a different autoupdate URL to allow them to manage when they get new versions. Normally everything works fine but at one company they have some workstations that autoupdate fine and some workstations that do not. The fact that some workstations autoupdate fine seems to indicate that the problem isnt with the .crx or the update xml file. p  pI ran chrome on a problematic workstation with codeenableloggingcode turned on to get a debug log of the autoupdate behavior, using this command linep  pcodeCProgram Files x86GoogleChromeApplicationgtchrome.exe vmoduleextensionupdater2 enablelogging extensionsupdatefrequency30codep  pHeres the output of the extensionupdater module from codechromedebug.logcode.

However, when I take this log myself on a machine where autoupdate does work theres also nothing logged for my extension unless theres a new version available.

The bug is still very vague to me because it seems to happen randomly, there are two bugsp  ol liThe LabelsTicks on YTime Axis, sometimes get rendered sometimes notli liAfter the View loads and the user clicks on start to load the first set of data to visualize and then start clicking update keep clicking 1 click per second or faster to simulate incoming live data, some of the data points already rendered disappear, further clicking on update, the data points that have disappeared might come again or not.li ol  pTo see the bugs for yourself simply start the application a few times and click start and see if the time axis doesnt render properly, keep doing this until you see the problem. The Bug, as said, doesnt happen regularly.p  pFor Bug number 2, start the application from the fiddle, click the start button inside the view, and then keep clicking update to generate data points, after you have generated a few points, you can zoom a little bit into the chart, pan so that the blue now line is in the middle or so and then continue generating data points by clicking update, after some time you will notice that the points that already has been rendered are removed, which is not supposed to be, because I dont make changes to already existing data, I only add new records to my stores.p  pThe Application works as follows We have a line chart with no series at the beginning, after user clicks start, two stores are created and two series gets created with each having one of the stores. When user clicks update, either a new store and series for that store is created or a new data point is added to one of the existing stores. p  pThe code in the fiddle is probably not ideal, but that is more about coding styles than rendering of charts.p

This is where I want to restrict callback if translation values from matrix is 0 after scaling  zooming                          but it still gives values gt 0 if trying to pan.                         moveViewsWithSameDistancefixTransX, fixTransY                          last.setcurr.x, curr.y                                          break codepre  pThe issue I am facing is all works well while translating the tags over panned image. But when the Image has reached its bounds it still get translationX or translationY  values greaterless than 0 which makes my tags move out of bound. Is there any way I can restrict the extra translation. I have tried with matrix method. I still get the translation values above 0 after I reach its bounds when the image is scaled.p

Negative 330 pI play a tile based game where there is a programmable C emulator ingame. p  pNow, through a function in the emulator, you can get tiles as objects in scripts you create, but only if they are connected to the same gridbuilding as the emulator block. Im trying to store the object I get from the function ingame, so I can access itget a handle when I seperate it from the gridNormally, when I seperate it, the emulator no longer returns me that object.p  pAlso, the emulator can only store strings. So, I cant store it using file streams I think. p  pIs there any way to store an object or object reference in a string in C so I can access it the next time I run the program p

You create classes to represent the pages under test, so the steps carry out actions upon them rather than look at the DOM directly all the time.

I am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdobtcoformbuilder relnofollowdobcto formbuildera plugin. This plugin uses a hrefhttprivetsjs.com relnofollowrivets.jsa and a hrefhttpbackbonejs.org relnofollowbackbone.jsa. In my previous question I was unable to figure out what was going wrong but then after 12 hours of research into that plugin code I found that the problem is when the data is added to the textbox using some popup. But when added manually through keyboard, the change event triggers successfully and textbox data is added to the JSON result. I gone through rivets.js documentation and read everything about it.

The time in the results is in milliseconds, and as you can, see the Linux machine prints form 5 seconds to 10 seconds only doing the simple code that I show before, but on the mac machine this does not happen. Unfortunately my final product should be on Linux, so the time executing this code is affecting  the final result of a highperformance product. I dont what is the trouble with this code in Linux.

Negative 330 pI am planning to build a client for our web service to support readingsaving files from our application. The client can be implemented easily by adding some custom dialogs as part of the application but I am thinking of creating a virtual drive like thing in Windows which would allow any application to use the standard OpenSave dialogs to readwrite from this virtual drive. The virtual drive would internally call GETPOST to readwrite from the web service. It will be implemented using Windows Shell Extension Handlers.p  pOur requirements also includes that the user must be able to TAG the file during save and to be able to search using these tags while opening a file. I see that the standard Windows save dialog has tagging feature for certain files and the open file dialog has a search bar. My question is   p  ol liwhether it is possible to eminformem the Common dialogs that the virtual drive supports tagging and it should be visible during saveli liHack the search box using callbacks etc to provide more advancedcustomised searching of filesli ol

What is important is the codeccallcode, which passes a string, codejsonCStrcode, this strings length, and codebsonError.wrapcode. This last object comes from a hrefhttpsgithub.compzionLibBSON.jlblobmastersrcBSONError.jl relnofollowhttpsgithub.compzionLibBSON.jlblobmastersrcBSONError.jla and is an arrayp  precodetype BSONError     wrapVectorUint8      function BSONError         return newArrayUint8, 512     end end codepre  pcreated in the above constructor of codeBSONErrorcode object, an array of 512 codeUint8codes.

This latter, however, returns with an error messagep  precodeLoadError MethodError convert has no method matching convertTypePtrUInt8, ArrayUInt8,1 This may have arisen from a call to the constructor PtrUInt8..., since type constructors fall back to convert methods.

Negative 330 pIm not sure if this is possible or not. Im interested in being able to find the x,y position of a word of text on a codeWinFormcode.p  pFor example, in the picture below, I want to be able to pull the x,y coordinate of the upperleft hand corner of the letter H in HERE.p  pI know how to get the position of textbox, so I can make a rough estimate based off of where the word HERE is inside the textbox, but I would like to be able to just ask the program where the word is if that is possible.p  pAlso, if there is a way to get that position, Id like to be able to get the length and height of the word Basically I want to know the coordinates of the bounding box of the word HERE if possiblep  pNot sure if this matters, but the textbox is a coderichTextBoxcode, and the textbox is populated from a string array in the codeForm1code class.p  pThank you in advancep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPvq6b.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPvq6b.jpg altenter image description hereap
