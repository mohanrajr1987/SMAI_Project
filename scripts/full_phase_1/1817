Positive 1817 pFrom the beginning of my project, I use a custom framework, lets call it custom.framework. But there was a bug in this framework and now I want to use another version of the custom.framework.p  pAt first, I simply removed the custom.framework file from my project and added the new one. But nothing changed, the bug was still there.p  pAfter multiple tries and hours, I understood that Xcode add the old version in memory and used this one instead of the new version. I know it because in the new version I added a method and when I cmdclick the class Ive add the method into, its not there and the files path is unavailable.p  pSearching through the web, I tried to change some version parameters to my framework projects Compatibility version, Curent Library version, Framework version. But this didnt change anything to Xcode which keeps using the old version.p  pI also tried to make the frameworks project as a subproject and add resulting framework as a dependency to my target. It worked well, but as the frameworks project is on a separated remote git repository, I dont think this is an acceptable solution.p  pSo my last try was to build a custom2.framework, to force Xcode to use the real file and not some cached version. But again, it doesnt work and when building I get errors telling me that all my classes in custom2.framework are duplicated symbols of its cached version of custom.framework.p  pSo my question is simple how can I finally tell Xcode to deleted its cached old version and let me use the file I gave him I already tried to delete my projects derivedData but it seems cached frameworks arent there.... Im so desperate p

Positive 1817 pSometimes when merging two branches in a Mercurial repository all symbolic links get corrupted, the resulting file is a file containing the path to the file instead of a proper symbolic link. This renders a failed build since the compiler will try to parse and build the file containing a path to the file it should have been compiling, hence compiling fails. Usually this renders all of the CocoaPods used corrupted and in some cases some of the precompiled frameworks that are stored in the repo are also corrupted  the fix is to perform a fresh install of pods empod installem or sometimes just empod updateem will do. The same goes for precompiled frameworks, these have to be imported again into the project and hence overwriting the corrupt frameworks files.p  pIs there any way to solve this without migrating from Mercurialp

Positive 1817 pAs a beginner looking at Sails, I see simple examples leading one through, but see nothing that tells me what is actually happening in this framework.  Thus, I dont see where I would add a new page or change a layout, etc.  When a Java program or servlet is called, I can see exactly where it starts, where it services events, etc. and how they are handled.  PHP, most other systems, the same way.  p  pSo, what is the architecture of Sails  A diagram showing whats on the server, how the application one creates is started and how it gets events and services them.  What is the structure of a page  What affects the layout  If I want to have 3 buttons on the bottom of the page that lead to other pages, how do I do thatp  pI have an existing MySQL database.  Can I generate a CRUD application for it as I can in Ruby on Rails  Show me.p  pVery difficult to see how to actually do useful work, not just play around, when there are only trivial examples that dont usually work and if you make any changes, you have to delete everything and start completely over  To be useful, you have to know where things are and if something is not working, where to look to fix it.  You have to grok the systemp

Negative 1817 pIm very interested in the answer to another question regarding watchdog timers for Windows services see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions218447bestwaytodetermineifanetwindowsservicehasnothung218498218498herea. That answer statedp  blockquote   pI have also used an internal watchdog system running in another thread. That thread looks at the main thread for activity like log output or a toggling event. If the activity is not seen then the service is considered hung and I shutdown the service.p      pIn this case you can configure windows to autorestart a stopped service and that might clear the problem as long as its not an internal logic bug.p      pAlso services I work with have text logs that are written to a log. In addition for services that are about to sleep for a bit, I log the time for the next wake up. I use MTAIL to watch a log for output.p blockquote  pCould anyone give some sample code how to use an internal watchdog running in another thread, since I currently have a task to develop a windows service which will be able to self restart in case it failed, hung up, etc.p  pI really appreciate your help.p

Negative 1817 pI recently purchased a Magic Mouse. It is fantastic and full of potential. Unfortunately, it is seriously hindered by the software support. I want to fix that. I have done quite a lot of research and these are my findings regarding the event chain thus farp  ol liThe Magic Mouse sends full multitouch events to the system.li liMultitouch events are processed in the MultitouchSupport.framework Carbonli liThe events are interpreted in the framework and sent up to the system as normal events ul liWhen you scroll with one finger it sends actual scroll wheel events.li liWhen you swipe with two fingers it sends a swipe event.li ulli liNo NSTouch events are sent up to the system. You cannot use the NSTouch API to interact with the mouse.li ol  pAfter I discovered all of the above, I diassembled the MultitouchSupport.framework file and, with some googling, figured out how to insert a callback of my own into the chain so I would receive the raw touch event data. If you enumerate the list of devices, you can attach for each device trackpad and mouse. This finding would enable us to create a framework for using multitouch on the mouse, but only in a single application. See my post here a hrefhttppaste.lisp.orgdisplay89743Raw Multitouch Trackinga.p  pI want to add new functionality to the mouse across the entire strongsystemstrong, not just a single app.p  pIn an attempt to do so, I figured out how to use a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.commaclibrarydocumentationCarbonReferenceQuartzEventServicesRefReferencereference.htmlEvent Tapsa to see if the lowest level event tap would allow me to get the raw data, interpret it, and send up my own events in its place. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The event tap, even at the HID level, is still a step above where the input is being interpreted in MultitouchSupport.framework.p  pSee my event tap attempt here a hrefhttppaste.lisp.orgdisplay89744Event Tap  Attempt Raw Multitoucha.br  An interesting side note when a multitouch event is received, such as a swipe, the default case is hit and prints out an event number of 29. The header shows 28 as being the max.p  pOn to my question, now that you have all the information and have seen what I have tried what would be the best approach to extending the functionality of the Magic Mouse I know I need to insert something at a low enough level to get the input before it is processed and predefined events are dispatched. So, to boil it down to single sentence questionsp  ul liIs there some way to override the default callbacks used in MultitouchSupport.framework  li liDo I need to write a kext and handle all the incoming data myself  li liIs it possible to write a kext that sits on strongemtopemstrong of the kext that is handling the input now, and filters it after that kext has done all the hard workli ul  pMy first goal is to be able to dispatch a middle button click event if there are two fingers on the device when you click. Obviously there is far, far more that could be done, but this seems like a good thing to shoot for, for now.p  pThanks in advancep  pSastirap

Negative 1817 pI have an Oracle database where Im trying to select a codeusercode field from the earliest row based on a codetimecode field where certain conditions are met, and I dont know how to do it.

I dont think I can use codeHAVINGcode since Im not doing any aggregate functions in my SELECT.  The earliest codetimecode value condition needs to apply emonlyem to the selection of the codeusercode field, i.e. I want codeidcode and codevaluecode to be selected for emallem values of the codetimecode field.p  pI was thinking I could keep the SELECT statement I have above and then JOIN with another SELECT statement that gets the particular codeusercode I want.p  precodeSELECT id, status, time, user FROM         ...query above...      ,              SELECT user        FROM table1        WHERE subject in ... AND              field  Status AND              ROWNUM  1        ORDER BY time ASC       codepre  pHowever, this only gets one value for codeusercode overall, and there should be a separate codeusercode value for each codeidcode SELECTed in my first query.  How do I limit my codeSELECT usercode query by the other querys codeidcode field  Is this even the right approach to get what I wantp

Just give them the view and they do the rest. But I guess adding a new codeUIViewcode object to every row might turn out to be a heavy object allocation and decreasing the frame rate.

Negative 1817 pIve been trying to follow this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms733766.aspxtutoriala for deploying a WCF sample to IIS . I cant get it to work. This is a hosted site, but I do have IIS Manager access to the server.

I cant seem to find a menu item, context menu item, or what not to create a new application.

Negative 1817 pI am running a Drupal powered website of my college. Each student has a certain fixed number of hours to complete in any kind of sport. Now, I am maintaining various sports on my website using CCK and Views.p  pNow, if a student plays some sport say A, he will go to the website and check out As details. Also, after specified period of time a link appears on the A page where student can check out his hours. He can then log in and check his hours for A. And similarly, for others. Important point here is for different sports he will see differently managed hours.p  pThere will also be a point where he can see his total hours that have been approved.p  pMost of the hours in my website are uploaded using .csv file. So, I am trying to do this mainly without the Drupal Modules. When someone uploads a .csv file I take the page title as a parameter and create a table with name as page title which is nothing but my event name. And, when some student queries his hours, I send it as a hidden parameter the title of the page and then return the hours of the student.p  pBut, now I want to do this using a Drupal Module because this approach is somehow not working. Can anyone suggest me a Drupal Module for the abovep  pI tried using many modules for above, most close being User Points, in which I perceive points as hours. But this had some problems.p

Team X decided to slightly change database schema to be able to add new features also it decided to change grouping strategy.p  pstrongDomainstrong There are some Entities that should be grouped. emApproach 1em is to have field group in table ENTITY and write there ids of Entities like 1,3,41.

I am missing something obvious here  I have 4 tabs and the for loop gets executed 4 times, and makes 4 separate calls to popToRootViewController.p  pThe reason this is important is if I am at the rootViewController it is safe for me to update the underlying database without leaving the user in a view that no longer makes sense or is valid.  For example, the root has a table of items, touching an item gives you detail about that item.  If the user touches another tab the detail item view controller is still in memory.  If the app receives an update where this record is no longer valid then tabbing back to it will cause a crash or inconsistent state.p  pHope that makes sense and any help would be useful even if it is simply ideas on how to troubleshoot the problem.p  pRegardsp  pDavep  pP.S.p  pThis all stems from the fact that my app used to check for an update at startup throw out the old database and use the new one.

Each group has 20200 distinct product numbers pnumber, so there are at least a few thousand CatalogItems.p  pI am working on formsets for the Transaction model.  Instead of a single select menu with the several thousand CatalogItems for the ForeignKey field, I want to substitute three dropdown menus, for group, run, and pnumber, which uniquely identify the CatalogItem. Id also like to limit the choices in the second two dropdowns to those runs and pnumbers which are available for the currently selected product group I can update them via AJAX if the user changes the product group, but its important that the initial page load as described without relying on AJAX.p  pWhats the best way to do thisp  pAs a point of departure, heres what Ive triedconsidered so farp  pMy first approach was to exclude the item foreign key field from the form, add the substitute dropdowns by overriding the addfields method of the formset, and then extract the data and populate the fields  manually on the model instances before saving them.  Its straightforward and pretty simple, but its not very reusable and I dont think it is the right way to do this.p  pMy second approach was to create a new field which inherits both MultiValueField and ModelChoiceField, and a corresponding MultiWidget subclass.  This seems like the right approach.  As Malcolm Tredinnick put it in  a hrefhttptinyurl.comdjangoformsdesign relnofollowa djangousers discussiona,  the smarts of a field lie in the Field class.p  pThe problem Im having is whenwhere to fetch the lists of choices from the db.  The code I have now does it in the Fields codeinitcode, but that means I have to know which ProductGroup Im dealing with before I can even define the Form class, since I have to instantiate the Field when I define the form.  So I have a factory function which I call at the last minute from my viewafter I know what CatalogItems I have and which product group theyre into create formformset classes and instantiate them.  It works, but I wonder if theres a better way.  After all, the field should be  able to determine the correct choices much later on, once it knows  its current value.p  pAnother problem is that my implementation limits the entire formset to transactions relating to CatalogItems from a single ProductGroup.p  pA third possibility Im entertaining is to put it all in the Widget class.  Once I have the related model instance, or the cid, or whatever the widget is given, I can get the ProductGroup and construct the dropdowns.  This would solve the issues with my second approach, but doesnt seem like the right approach.p

Negative 1817 pI am trying to implement a text box where a user can type, use arrow keys, backspace, delete, etc.  I would like to be able to know what is in this text box without the user needing to submit anything.  I suppose I could catch keypress events, find a way to display a cursor, and basically build a mintexteditor by handbut maybe that would be reinventing the wheelp  pWhat I am after is rather scrabblelike.  You have several letters in the top part of a window and a text box in the bottom.  Each time you type a letter it disappears from the top pane so that you know when youve used them all up.  I want to be able to edit that text with the arrow keys, cause rather than the 7 letters scrabble would give me I hope to be doing this with paragraphs.p  pI have the window displaying, and the source file processed and displayed as a list of allowable letters... I just want to update the list of allowable letters while the user types in their sentence.  Can Xlib do this  Is there something else that might be more suitable  Thanksp

Negative 1817 pHeyo, this is my first time asking a question here so do forgive me if I mess somethin up ltp  pIm working on a program similar to openCanvas, the earlier ones that allowed multiple people to draw on the same canvas in real time over the internet. OCs really buggy and has a lot of limitations, which is why I wanted to write this.p  pI have it set up so the canvas extends indefinitely in all directions and is made up of 512x512 blocks of pixels that dont become active until theyre drawn on, which should be really easy to make, and I was thinking about using Direct3D to make it hardware accelerated, thus the 512 square blocks.p  pMy problem comes when I want to use layers, Im not quite sure how I can compose layers quickly and without using a ton of memory, since my target is DirectX9 compatible video cards with 128m of memory, and a system with about 3.2 ghz of CPU power and between 2 and 8 gigs of ram. I had a few different approaches I was thinking of using and was wondering which would probably be the best, and if there was anything I could look into to make it run better.p  pMy first idea was to make the gfx hardware do as much work as possible by having all the layers on all the blocks serve as textures, and theyd be updated by locking the changed area, updating them on the cpu, and unlocking them. Blocks that arent currently being changed are flattened into one texture and the individual layers themselves are kept in system memory, which would reduce the gfx memory used, but could significantly increase bandwidth usage between system and gfx memory. I can see the constant locking and unlocking potentially slowing down the system pretty bad as well. Another possible issue is that Ive heard some people using up to 200 layers, and I cant think of any good ways to optimize that given the above.p  pMy other idea was to compose the textures completely in system memory, write them into a texture, and copy that texture to gfx memory to be rendered in each block. This seems to eliminate a lot of the issues with the other method, but at the same time Im moving all the work into the CPU, instead of balancing it. This isnt a big deal as long as it still runs quickly, though. Again, however, theres the issue of having a couple hundred layers. In this case though, I could probably only update the final pixels that are actually changing, which is what I think the bigger name programs like Sai and Photoshop do.p  pIm mostly looking for recommendations, suggestions that might improve the above, better methods, or links to articles that might be related to such a project. While Im writing it in C, I have no trouble translating from other languages. Thanks for your timep

Negative 1817 pI have a small problem.  I need to rebuild a version of linux so that it matches a version built a while ago.  But, I am having some problems.p  pI was wondering what aspects of a linux box would affect the build process of the kernel  Here are a few facts.p  pAt present our company uses a prebuilt and preinstalled version of fedora to install engineers development box.  This version is just block copied onto blank hard disks.  If I use a development box I can successfully rebuild the kernel so it is a byte for byte match with the original that I am trying to reproduce.p  pBut I need to prove to a government body that we have done nothing bad to the kernel, so they require us to build the linux kernel on a machine that has been installed from scratch using only trust software.  Trusted means downloaded from official web sites and verified via hashing results.  A machine built in this manner produces a kernel that differs from that built on the development box and therefore differs from the original I am trying to match.p  pWhat variables may affect the outcome of the build  At present these are the same across the two boxes trusted and developmentp  ul liGCC versionli liRun time kernelli lisource of kernel I am trying to rebuild including .configs filesli ul  pAny ideas on what create the differencesp
Negative 1817 pI am developing a window forms application that is expected to display an SSRS report on the UI.p  pA brief backgroundp  ol liWe have a 3  tier architecture in place.

The reports are manually read, verified and dispatched to relevant distribution list since we are in the initial phase of development. In addition as mentioned earlier, we are expected to provide ad hoc generation of reports via a win form application, for which we can use the Report Viewer control. However, we do not want the GUI directly connecting to the remote reporting server, since user permissioing is driven of user defined tables and so want the all calls form the GUI being routed via our App Server. li ol  pIs is possible to remotely manage an SSRS job. I hope to manage it from the App Server.If not, could you please share your suggestions of how I can circumvent the problemp

Negative 1817 pI am designing a RESTful web service that needs to be accessed by users, but also other web services and applications. All of the incoming requests need to be authenticated. All communication takes place over HTTPS. User authentication is going to work based on an authentication token, acquired by POSTing the username and password over an SSL connection to a emsessionem resource provided by the service.p  pemIn the case of web service clients, there is strongno end userstrong behind the client service.em The requests are initiated by scheduled tasks, events or some other computer operations. The list of connecting services is known beforehand obviously, I guess. strongHow should I authenticate these requests coming from other web servicesstrong I want the authentication process to be as easy as possible to implement for those services, but not at the cost of security. What would be the standard and best practices for a scenario like thisp  pOptions that I can think of or have been suggested to mep  ol lipHave the client services resort to having a fake username and password, and authenticate them in the same way as users. I do not like this option  it just doesnt feel right.pli lipAssign a permanent application id for the client service, possibly an application key as well. As far as I have understood this is just the same as having username  password. With this id and key, I can either authenticate each request, or create an authentication token to authenticate further requests. Either way, I do not like this option, because anyone who can get a hold of the application id and key can impersonate the client.pli lipI could add an IP address check to previous option. This would make it harder to perform fake requests.pli lipClient certificates. Set up my own certificate authority, create root certificate, and create client certificates for the client services. A couple of issues come to mind, though a how do I still allow the users to authenticate without certificates and b how complicated is this scenario to implement from the client service point of viewpli lipemSomething else  there must be other solutions out thereem pli ol  pMy service would be running on Java, but I deliberately left out information about what specific framework it would be built on, because I am more interested on the basic principles and not so much on the implementation details  I assume the best solution for this will be possible to implement regardless of the underlying framework. However, I am a bit inexperienced with this subject, so concrete tips and examples on the actual implementation such as useful third party libraries, articles, etc. will be much appreciated as well.p

Negative 1817 pI understand this is a subjective question and, as such, may be closed but I think it is worth asking.p  pLets say, when building an application using TDD and going through a refactor, a library appears.  If you yank the code out of your main application and place it into an separate assembly, do you take the time to write tests that cover the code, even though your main application is already testing it Its just a refactor.p  pFor example, in the a hrefhttpnerddinner.codeplex.com relnofollowNerdDinnera application, we see wrappers for FormsAuthentication and MembershipProvider.  These objects would be very handy across multiple applications and so they could be extracted out of the NerdDinner application and placed into their own assembly and reused.p  pIf you were writing NerdDinner today, from scratch, and you noticed that you had a grabbag of really useful wrappers and services and you bring them into a new assembly, do you create new tests that fully cover your new assemblypossibly having repeat tests  Is it enough to say that, if your main application runs green on all its tests, your new assembly is effectively coveredp  pWhile my example with NerdDinner may be too simplistic to really worry about, I am more thinking about larger APIs or libraries.  So, do you write tests to recover what you tested before may be a problem because you will probably start with all your tests passing or do you just write tests as the new assembly evolvesp

The question is how do I generate the boolean value that tells me whether the new values with the same id is completely identical to the one in the db It has to check every single filed of long list of fields that will take forever to type out, any type of output would be good as long as I can tell one means its different and one means its the samep  pA side question is how do I update the row after that since I dont want to type out every single field, my temporary solution is to delete the row with the out of date primary id and then insert the new data in but if there is a fast way to update all columns in a row thatd be great.p

Negative 1817 pI have some HTML I need to parse. p  pBasically Im walking through the dom of a given element. Grabbing text nodes, and element nodes.p  pAs I come across text nodes, I print them into a different element character by character. Each character is placed into its own span, with its own style, which was taken from any element node found with a style attached.p  pSo when an element node is found, its style is applied to any text node detected until another element node is found and the old style is replaced with the new one. p  pThe code below works. If you have a sentence or a short paragraph in the source element it reproduces the text accurately in less than a second. The longer the text gets the longer it takes duh. p  pInterestingly, the more text that is already in the destination element, the longer it takes. So if Ive ran this function 10 times on the same source element, with the same body of text being processed, it will run slower the 10th time through than the 1st time through, presumably because its harder to render the text in an element that already has content.p  pAnyway, I really need to find a way to make this thing run faster. p  pLastly, here is an example HTML snippet this thing might need to processp  precodeltspan styleblah blahgt Some text ltspangtltspangtEven more text ltspangt ltpgt stuff ltpgt codepre  pThe resulting HTML would bep  precodeltspan styleblah blahgtSltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgtoltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgtmltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgteltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgt ltspangt  ltspan styleblah blahgttltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgteltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgtxltspangt ltspan styleblah blahgttltspangt  ....... codepre  pNothing fancy.p  pHeres the codep  pCodep  precodeed.rtatoarrpaste  functionele, curstyle       var childarr  ele.childNodes      ifissetcurstyle          curstyle             forvar i  0 i lt childarr.length i          ifchildarr[i].nodeType  1              ifcurstyle  childarr[i].style                  curstyle  childarr[i].style                       else ifchildarr[i].nodeType  3               forvar n  0 n lt childarr[i].nodeValue.length n                   var span  ed.addsinglecharchildarr[i].nodeValue.charAtn, curstyle                               ed.rtatoarrpastechildarr[i], curstyle        codepre  pEDITbr One example of a system like this being used is in google docs.p  pWhen a user pastes text into the document, its first rendered off screen, then processed with a function similar Im assuming to this one.

Im guessing this is the correct approach because I dont want to define the header and navigation for each page.  I could use a master page in my .NET pages.p  pMy first inclination was to use an IFrame on my page.  Most of the information Ive found on this topic is to try and avoid using IFrames all together.  Im looking for the best technique what is generally the bestcorrect way to do this.  So I replaced the IFrame with a  and use xxx.contentfilename to load my content and it appears to work.  But is this approach flawed  p  pDoes this generally work  Is this a correct approach  Is there something better  Im looking for anything that can help me understand the correct way to do this.p  pAny tips, links, recommended books on the subject, are greatly appreciated.  p  pThank you so much.p
Negative 1817 pIm primarily using Drupal and am considering moving away from CMS.  If I were to build my own platform could I integrate modules like commenting systems, user login, etc. through a PHPPython API  What would be the proper stepsgood places to lookgood tutorial on this  Would I have to build all of my own tables manually to suit the needs of such custom modules  Im wondering if this would even be possible with out having to hard code all of this by hand  Thank you.p
Negative 1817 pGreeting, I have an image that I sliced it with Fireworks then I export it to html. I opened the HTML with Dreamweaver and I saved the file to php and it works OK. I replaced few images with HTML input tags and html buttons and set their width and height with css with same size as the original image and I placed them in same place exactly in the live view in Dreamweaver the page looks perfect but when I few it in Firefox or IE the looks look messy and the sizes of the input fields and the buttons look lager. Please look at my code and advice me how to solve the problemp  pIm going to put my original and the modified one to compare. p  pOriginal Codep  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lt saved from url0014aboutinternet gt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegthabibcontactus.jpglttitlegt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt ltstyle typetextcssgttd img display blockltstylegt ltFireworks CS5 Dreamweaver CS5 target.

Negative 1817 pReferring to the Postgres Documentation on a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocscurrentstaticdatatypecharacter.htmlCharacter Typesa, I am unclear on the point of specifying a length for character varying varchar types.p  pAssumptionp  ul lithe length of string doesnt matter to the application.li liyou dont care that someone puts that maximum size in the databaseli liyou have unlimited hard disk spaceli ul  pIt does mentionp  blockquote   pThe storage requirement for a short string up to 126 bytes is 1 byte   plus the actual string, which includes the space padding in the case   of character. Longer strings have 4 bytes of overhead instead of 1.   Long strings are compressed by the system automatically, so the   physical requirement on disk might be less. Very long values are also   stored in background tables so that they do not interfere with rapid   access to shorter column values. In any case, the longest possible   character string that can be stored is about 1 GB. The maximum value   that will be allowed for n in the data type declaration is less than   that. It wouldnt be useful to change this because with multibyte   character encodings the number of characters and bytes can be quite   different.p blockquote  pThis talks about the size of string, not the size of field, i.e. sounds like it will always compress a large string in a large varchar field, but not a small string in a large varchar fieldp  pI ask this question as it would be much easier and lazy to specify a much larger size so you never have to worry about having a string too large. For example, if I specify varchar50 for a place name I will get locations that have more characters e.g. Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, but if I specify varchar100 or varchar500, Im less likley to get that problem.p  pSo would you get a performance hit between varchar500 and arbitrarily varchar5000000 or text if your largest string was say 400 characters longp  pAlso out of interest if anyone has the answer to this AND knows the answer to this for other databases, please add that too.p  pI have googled, but not found a sufficiently technical explanation.p

Negative 1817 pBelow, I have written simple code that recreates problems that have emerged as my application is growing.p  pstrongProblem Statementstrongbr I have a class that needs to be used to create polymorphic objects which each require a variable number of arrays as input.  So I might have two to five of these objects instantiated throughout the time my app is running.  And between them, these objects might have 15 arrays.  Whats more, some of these arrays need to be modifyable from a variety of different, other objects after they are created, not just by the objects that created or house them.p  pstrongThree Questionsstrongbr strong1.strong What is the most stablerecommended way of passing a number of different arrays into a class  I have used a varargs approach below, but am not sure if this is the best way.br strong2.strong How can I avoid problems due to the static key word  You will see that the code in Main.java below throws errors related to the static key word.  I hesitate to allow all instances of the class to share a single copy of the array.

Negative 1817 pIm writting a client using socket to receive EEG data from a recording PC RP to produce some online feedback.p  pThe RP has a server which sends the data over TCP. The data is being sent with blocks, each having a header and data alltogether is 2560 bytes. The blocks are sent every strong20 msstrong 50 Hz.p  pWhen I run the client, it receives the blocks in strongburstsstrong e.g. one block for strong40msstrong then next one instantaniously, strong0msstrong. First I thought this is because the server uses Nagles algorithm and packets are small to be sent individually, but when I reduce the block size to, say, 400 bytes, the recv returning time becomes much more stable around 20ms now. Still some variation but no bursts anymore. Even with the 2.5k packets, the total required bandwidth doesnt look large 502560  128 kBs. Same unstability is present when Im running both client and server on localhost. What might be the problem herep  pHerers the simplified clients codep  precode ...  packet definitions as ctypes structures from protocoldefines import header, message  s  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM s.connectaddr, port hdr  header  24 bytes msg  message  2560 bytes  while True     s.recvintohdr  this thing should return once the hdr buffer is filled      ... check if the message is ok ...     s.recvintomsg  this thing should return once the hdr buffer is filled     print time.time  this is how I measure arrival times codepre  pstrongUPDstrong I checked the conversation with wireshark. The problem seems to be in the client it sends [ACK] packets only after 40ms since the last servers [PSH, ACK] the server responds almost instantaneously on clients [ACK]. The server has already acquired 2 packets by the time, so it sends 2 glued packets. The question remains opened p  pPS Im using Ubuntu with 2.6.35 kernelp

Negative 1817 pIf I had 2 tables, say blogcategory and blog, each blog can belong in a particular category only so a 11  relationship based on a key called blogcategoryid. p  pNow in my code I would do something likep  precodeLoop through categories such as  foreachcategories as cat then for each category create an array of all its posts posts  catgtgetPosts  This would be another DB call to get all posts for the cat do stuff with posts endforeach codepre  pNow to me this seems like it could end up quite expensive in terms of DB calls depending on the size of categories. Would this still be the best solution to do this Or would I be able to do something in the code and first retrieve all the categories, then retrieve all the blogs and map them to their corresponding category via the id somehow This would in theory be only 2 calls to the DB, now size wise the result set for call 2 the blogs would definitely be larger, but would the actual DB call be as expensivep  pI would normally go for the first option, but Im just wondering if there would be a better way of approaching this or is it more likely that the extra processing in PHP would be more costly in terms of performance Also specifically from an MVC perspective, if the model returns the categories, but it should also return the corresponding blogs for that category, Im not sure how best to structure this, from my understanding, shouldnt the model return all the data required for the viewp  pOr would I be better off selecting all categories and blogs using inner joins in the first query and create the output I need of this Perhaps by using a multidimensional arrayp  pThanksp

Negative 1817 pI realize you are coming up with a way for panels to communicate.  Until that time, I was thinking I could get some basic communication going with a preference object.p  pBut how do I find a unique ID for the dashboard where an app residesp  pIn case there might be a better solution than sharing info via a preference object, let me describe the specific problem we want to solve  Certain projects within our project structure represent programs for which we want to display a metrics dashboard that dashboard would consist of multiple apps on a shared dashboard.  But programs are not at consistent levels in the rally project hierarchy, and we only have about four programs though we have many many rally projects.p  pBecause of this, Id like this code metrics dashboard to be one page in Rally, which can easily switch between the various programs we have.  I would prefer not to use the project hierarchy to do this, because we have a lot of projects, and its time consuming and tricky to find and select the programs.p
Negative 1817 pI have a function that takes an image as an argument and produces a label and a score as a result.

Negative 1817 pI know this question has been rised quite a lot of times, but then they constantly change things at Facebook and none of the numerous ways Ive discovered on the web, works for me. Maybe it worked before, but not anymore. p  pI have a web page with a video playing in our skinned jwplayer.

Video even plays right there on the wall, in the embedded and customized flash player. So everything works as expected. p  pBut.. We would like to autopost our new posts onto the websites page on Facebook and we want them to look exactly like when they are shared.

Negative 1817 pIm trying to animate some stuff using the usual UIView class methods. Im calling these animate methods in a method called by the popular a hrefhttpsgithub.comnicklockwoodiCarousel relnofollowiCarousela library. When I scroll the carousel, the animation immediately goes to its completion state and calls the completion function ignoring the duration on the animation. The codefinishedcode BOOL is true, so it doesnt look like the animation is being interrupted.p  pWhen I trigger these animations outside of iCarousels delegate methods, they work. Im not looking to fix iCarousel, nor do I presume something is broken with it. Im more curious what code inside could possibly be causing my animation to complete immediately. And what I can do to avoid the problem.p  pHeres an examplep  precode voidcarouselCurrentItemIndexDidChangeiCarousel carousel      [UIView      animateWithDuration5.0f      delay0      options         UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut          UIViewAnimationOptionOverrideInheritedDuration          UIViewAnimationOptionOverrideInheritedCurve      animations         myView.alpha  0            completionBOOL finished          NSLogCompleted. Did it finish i, finished      ]  codepre  pLast detailbr iCarousels documentation mentions that you can change the useDisplayLink property of the carousel to avoid some conflicts with animation. This doesnt seem to make any difference.p  pThanks in advance for helpp

Negative 1817 pIn the following code I have two classes, one that runs in a separate thread and fires events, the other that subscribes to this event and receives data from the event.

Negative 1817 pI have to design a way to stream data in ScalaJava, with a certain delay compared to the moment I receive the data. I have an API for my original data source the real time one which lets me query it as it was a database, using a querylike format,  and also to get notification when something happens, much as with EHCACHE. p  pNow I want for example to stream data with different delays, according to the user privileges. Some of the users will see data streamed with 0 delay, other with 15 minutes, other with 60 minutes.  p  pI will therefore need a toplevel cache composed of multiple lower level caches 0 delay, 15 min delay, 60 min delay.p  ol lipIn a first moment I would like the cache to contain only elements of the same type. This would make the things simpler, because I can decide for a unique ID for the elements and I would have only to route the request to the right cache according to the required delaypli lipIn a second moment, I would like my delayed cache to be queryable. Is there a part of the code from EHCache which I can recycle, for examplepli ol

So now I have a list of say 250 phone numbers. I want to send these phone numbers back to the server and check to see which of these phone numbers belong to a User account.p  pSo I need to do a query codequery  User.queryUser.phone.INphoneslistcodep  pHowever, with GAE, this is quite an expensive query.

Why dont I host the phone numbers on another host, on another database, where this type of query is cheaper. Then I can have GAE send a HTTP request to my other server to get the desired info.p  pSo I have two questionsp  ol liAre there any databases more streamlined to handle these kinds of queries, and which it would be more cheaper to do Or will it all be the same as GAEli liIs this overkill Is it a good idea Should I suck it up and pay the costli ol

Negative 1817 pstrongScenario strongp  pI am trying to track two different colored objects. At the beginning, user is prompted to hold the first colored object say, may be a RED at a particular position in front of camera marked on screen by a rectangle and press any key, then my program takes that portion of frame ROI and analyze the color in it, to find what color to track. Similarly for second object also. Then as usual, use codecv.inRangecode function in HSV color plane and track the object.p  pstrongWhat is done strongp  pI took the ROI of object to be tracked, converted it to HSV and checked the Hue histogram.

Negative 1817 pOn Linux, the D runtime library relies on the codeendcode symbol in determining the GC root ranges codeman 3 endcode, which is in fact very similar to what the Boehm GC does.

Negative 1817 pI have a codeUITableViewcode that has certain cells that are a different height. I was hoping to have a way, without adding a button to each cell, to not receive responses to didSelectedRowAtIndexPath, if the touches in the cell are below a certain point.p  pAs an example, say I have two cells, one that has a height of 100 and another with a height of 150. Is there a way to not receive responses to codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode for touches below 100, but still receive the touch input on the cellp  pI thought of overriding the touches methods in the cell and returning the point of contact in a delegate to the controllertable and using that input to determine whether or not I will ignore the codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode response, but Im worried about the highlighting and other calls and whether it may not be fast enough to block those as well. It just seems really iffy to me.p

Negative 1817 pI have a very large data set that I have binned, and stored each bin subset as a list so that I can easily call any given subset. My problem is in calling for a specific column within a subset.p  pFor example my data which has diameters and strengths as the columns, is broken up into 20 bins, by diameter. I manually binned the data, like sop  precodesubset.1 lt subsetmydata, Diameter lt 0.01 codepre  pSimilar commands were used, to make 20 bins. Then I stored the names subset.1 through subset.20 into a listp  precodediameter.binltlistsubset.1, ... , subset.20 codepre  pI can successfully call each diameter bin usingp  precodediameter.bin[x] codepre  pNow, if I only want to see the strength values for a given diameter bin, I can use the original name that is store in the listp  precodesubset.xStrength codepre  pBut I cannot get this information using the list callp  precodediameter.bin[x]Strength codepre  pThis command returns codeNULLcodep  pNote that when I call any subset either by codediameter.bin[x]code, codesubset.xcode or even codesubset.xStrengthcode my column headers do show up. When I usep  precodenamessubset.1 codepre  pThis returns codeDiametercode and codeStrengthcodep  pBut when I usep  precodenamesdiameter.bin[1] codepre  pThis returns codeNULLcode. p  pIm assuming that the column header is part of the problem, but Im not sure how to fix it, other than take the headers off of the original data file. I would prefer not to do this if at all possible. p  pThe end goal is to look at the distribution of strength values for each diameter bin, so I will be doing things like drawing histograms, calculating parameters etc. I was hoping to do something along these lines to produce the histogramsp  precodenlengthdiameter.bin fori in 1n    histdiameter.bin[i]Strength  codepre  pAnd do something similar to this to store median values for each bin in a new vector.p  pAny tips are greatly appreciated, as right now Im doing it all 1 bin at a time, and I know a loop or something similar would really speed up my analysis.p

There are 9 cases, each cases has a different number of items. So far I have this code   p  precodeOverride public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu      Bundle bundle  getIntent.getExtras     int filterVariable  bundle.getIntfilterVariable     switch filterVariable           case 1         getSupportMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.filterfastfood, menu         break      case 2         getSupportMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.filterrestaurants, menu         break      case 3          getSupportMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.filtercoffeeshops, menu         break      case 4         getSupportMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.filterbars, menu         break   [... and so on]          return super.onCreateOptionsMenumenu  codepre  pIt works well, for every case I indeed have my different items in the menu. But I dont want these items to be reachable through the menu button of my device which is absolutely not instinctive and hard for the user to guess. These items are importants so I would like to have a button on the upper right corner, which would open this menu instead drop down menu  pop up menu.  p  pDo you know how such a thing can be done  I have seen this in some google application but couldnt find tutorial showing which tools to use for doing this.br Thanks p  pps I am using actionbarsherlock in my application.p

Negative 1817 pI am designing a USB OTG board as an extension board for Android. The board is based upon Freescale KL25Z128VLK4. Most part of design is similar to IOIO from Sparkfun, with some extensions.p  ol liBy connecting OTG cable from Android phone Galaxy Nexus to KL25Z board, Android acts as USB host and KL25Z acts as device B CDC.li liBy reverse connecting OTG cable, Android works in AOAADKADB mode, and KL25Z sources VBUS and charge current to Android.li ol  pIn current design, switching role hostdevice has to be done manually by swapping cable connection. However, in latter case, if KL25Z can not offer enough current to Android, KL25Z wants to hand over host role to Android, so it can switch off main supply of 5V500mA, and works in low power mode with VBUS from Android.p  pAnyway, I want my board to support switching mode between HOSTDevice, as well as support in Android.p  pIn principle, HNP protocol should be started for switching AB in OTG. However, I have no idea how to handle it in Android side. I mean I dont know how Android SDK support HNP in programmatic way Any API involved Any documents, labs and open projectsp

Negative 1817 pI have a project where I use require.js and hbs.js requirehandlebarsplugin, among others. Everything is working fine in my development environment, but after I optimized the project using r.js requirejs optimizing, I have a problem. p  pThat is because hbs.js precompiles only one locale the whole i18n logic is broken, it is no longer possible to change locale. I suspect that I somehow have to do the optimizing process for each locale, but I cant see how. It would be really nice if someone can share their solution to this problemp  pThanksp

Here is an example of how these structs are laid out in those librariesp  precodestruct MyObjectUnmanaged      SurfaceUnmanaged s     ...   struct SurfaceUnmanaged     int numPoints    double gridz    ....  codepre  pMyObjectUnmanaged has multiple structures nested within, and even structs like SurfaceUnmanaged will also have nested objects.  The user also needs to be able to allocate memory into these structures.    p  pIn the unmanaged library, The user creates an instance of MyObjectUnmanaged and modifies each of the necessary members by hand.  The user also accesses members of any nested objects and sets those values as well.  Finally, the pointer to the instance of MyObjectUnmanaged is passed into a static function where it is again modified.p  pHere is my managed wrapper for MyObjectUnmanagedp  precodepublic ref class MyObjectWrapperManaged        private     MyObjectUnmanaged o      public     MyObjectWrapperManaged o   new MyObjectUnmanaged   How should I write the accessors,properties  or functions to modify objects nested within o     void SetNumPointsForSurfaceint numPts  accessors like this seem inefficient and                                               gratiutous especially if there                                               are a lot of members to access and modify   codepre  pShould I be creating Managed wrappers for SurfaceUnmanaged If so, would they be public members of MyObjectWrapperManaged or would properties and accessors just return new instances of the hypothetical SurfaceManaged class What is the best way a client could access SurfaceUnmanaged to allocate memory from the top Levelp

Negative 1817 pI would like to create a type in C with value like semantics. It is immutable and it has a low memory footprint. However, it is mostly going to be accessed via an interface it implements. In this case, a value type would have to be boxed which means that the actual value would have to be copied from the stack to the heap. Therefore I wonder if there is any advantage at all in using a value type struct instead of a reference type classp  pTo illustrate my situation, I provide the following example of an interface codeIcode with implementations codeReferenceTypeImplementationcode and codeValueTypeImplementationcodep  precodeinterface I      int GetSomeInt   class ReferenceTypeImplementation  I      public readonly int i      public ReferenceTypeImplementation int i              this.i  i           public int GetSomeInt              return i2        struct ValueTypeImplementation  I      public readonly int i      public ValueTypeImplementation int i              this.i  i           public int GetSomeInt              return i2       codepre  pI would almost exclusively use these type using the interface codeIcode likep  precodeI i1  new ReferenceTypeImplementation1 I i2  new ValueTypeImplementation1 codepre  pIs there any advantage in using codeValueTypeImplementationcode over codeReferenceTypeImplementationcodep

Negative 1817 pIn my Rails app I use Paperclip to upload photos and store them in S3. So I wanted to bring that functionality into my iOS app. I got image uploading to work in my RubyMotion app using a hrefhttpsgist.github.comgregfroese4124753 relnofollowthis gista, but it was incredibly slow.

If we ask for 2 pairs K  2, a stronggoodstrong set of pairs would be code[1,2,3,4]code because almost every element appears in the list and we dont have repetitions of any element. A strongbadstrong set of pairs for K  2 would be code[1,2,1,3]code since its reusing the 1 element and is clearly biased towards the start of list.

Negative 1817 pI have a Pygame for a Ponglike game, and it looks pretty awesome right now, but there are a few things I cant figure out.p  pThe first problem is a problem with the sides. Ive set the bat to move around using the left and right arrow keys and stop when it reaches the side using positioning, but if you press the left key on the left side or the right key on the right side, it will go outside of the playing area by a little bit.p  pThe second problem, like the first is about the sides too. Ive set the ball to move around and bounce of the walls using positioning, but if the bat is on the left or right side, and I am the holding the corresponding key, the ball will go right through the wallceilingp  pThe final problem is that Ive set the ball to speed up over time using velocity. If you were good at the game, it would speed up until the ball was so fast it had the power to break right through the bat.p  pThis is my codep  precodeimport pygame, time, sys, random from pygame.locals import  pygame.init  screen  pygame.display.setmode600, 500 pygame.display.setcaption Pong Squash  def gameplay1     global gameoverdisplay, lives, points, livesremaining, gameover1, lives1, points1, livesremaining1, font1, font2, white, black, green, yellow, livesnumber, livescount, positionx, positiony, velocityx1, velocityy1, position1, position2, velocity1, velocity2, color, width, position, player, ball, points, pointscount, newpoints, yourscore1, space1, esc1, munrosmall, newpositionx, beeplist     gameoverdisplay  gameover1.png     lives  lives.png     points  points.png     livesremaining  livesremaining.png     yourscore  scoreintro.png     space  space.png     esc  esc.png     munrosmall  munrosmall.ttf     beep1  beep1.wav     beep2  beep2.wav     beep3  beep3.wav     beep4  beep4.wav      gameover1  pygame.image.loadgameoverdisplay.convert     lives1  pygame.image.loadlives.convert     points1  pygame.image.loadpoints.convert     livesremaining1  pygame.image.loadlivesremaining.convert     yourscore1  pygame.image.loadyourscore.convert     space1  pygame.image.loadspace.convert     esc1  pygame.image.loadesc.convert      font1  pygame.font.Fontmunrosmall, 40     font2  pygame.font.FontNone, 40      white  255,255,255     black  0, 0, 0     green  0, 250, 0     yellow  255, 255, 0      points  0     pointscount  font1.renderstrpoints, True, white     livescount  font1.render3, True, white      positionx  175     positiony  375     velocityx1  0     velocityy1  0     position1  275     position2  150     velocity1  2     velocity2  2      while True         for event in pygame.event.get             if event.type  QUIT                 pygame.quit                 sys.exit             elif event.type  KEYDOWN                 if event.key  pygame.KSPACE                     if waiting                         waiting  False                         resetball                 if event.key  pygame.KLEFT                     velocityx1  velocityx1  3                 elif event.key  pygame.

Negative 1817 pI am trying to setup Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers Kepler on Windows XP Pro SP3 with a roaming profile.  After extracting the directory from the zip file, I placed the folder in CProgram Files.  At some point, Eclipse placed a .eclipse folder Which apparently contains configuration files within the CDocuments and Settings[username] directory.  After several levels of subdirectories, the path length is too long for Windows to handle Specifically in the case of synchronizing the roaming profile.  The path length ends up being more than 260 characters above the 255 character windows limit.  This causes unacceptable problems when synchronizing a roaming profile.  A shorter path length should eliminate this particular problem.p  pCan this .eclipse directory be placed in another directory closer to the root directory  If so, how do I do redirect Eclipse to the alternate directory to look for its config filesp  pAlso, what strategy can I use to mitigate path length issues in general while developing using Javap  pAny help would be appreciated.p

But I am struggling to represent the polynomial expression using Linked List.p  pFor example, if the Postfix expression is   strong40 50 strongp  pI need to store strong40strong as strong4101  0101strong in a Linked List.

Negative 1817 pWe have a system based around an Atom Z510Intel SCH US15W Q7 card running Debian Linux. We need to transfer blocks of data from a device on the Low Pin Count Bus. As far as I know this chipset does not provide DMA facilities, meaning the processor has to read the data out a byte at a time in a software loop. The device driver actually implements this using the rep insb x86 instructions so the loop is actually implemented by the CPU if I understand correctly.p  pThis is far from optimal, but it should be possible to hit a transfer rate of 14Mbs. Instead we can barely manage 4Mbs with transactions on the bus no closer than 2us apart even though each read to the slave device is is done in 560ns. I dont believe other traffic on the bus is to blame, but am still investigating. p  pMy question is  p  blockquote   pstrongDoes any one know if there are any configuration registers on the SCH that could affect the LPC bus timingstrongp      pI cannot find any useful information on the device on the Intel website, nor have I spotted anything in the Linux Kernel code that appears to be fiddling with any such registers but Im a noob when it come to Linux Kernel stuff. p blockquote  pIm not an x86 expert so any other factors that might come into play or any other war stories relating to this device would be good to know about too.p  pstrongEditstrong I have found the a hrefhttpwww.intel.comcontentdamwwwpublicusendocumentsdatasheetsschdatasheet.pdfdatasheeta. Ive not seen anything in it that explains this behaviour, but I am investigating the possibility of mapping our device as a firmware device as the firmware bus cycles dont seem to suffer the same delays.p

Negative 1817 pI inherited this Frankenstein application at work that utilizes an Access 2007 DB frontend with linked tables to an Oracle 10g DB.p  pUsers have started reporting that a lot of the queries are failing with an error 3183 out of temporary space.

Negative 1817 pRecently I did a incomplete nonogram solver. The solver is based in the iterative line solving approach. Some code is like p  pMethod 1p  precodefor jlti j      ifa[j]  0 break  codepre  pMethod 2p  precodefor jlti ampamp a[j]0 j codepre  pThis piece of code occurs many times in my program. p  pI think both method 1 and method 2 did the same thing. But when I use codetime nonogramcode in a linux machine, when the size of the nonogram is around 5 x 10, then the time is very close to each other, most of time the method 2 faster. When the size is 30x40, I run the program for about 10 times, and most of time the method 1 runs faster then the method 2 time differences is around 0.2s. Is it a random issue If it is a just random issue, I will use method 2 over method 1. Are they really different in compiler implementation  Thank you. p

Negative 1817 pI have inherited a design where we are using a few global objects for doing stuff when the application exits updating application status log files, etc ... not important to the question. p  pBasically the application creates dummy helper objects of specific classes and lets their destructor do these extra works when the application exits either normally or when an error was encountered and the application knows what to do in all the cases, again not relevant to the question. p  pBut now I have encountered a situation where I do not want to call these destructors, just leave the application without executing these termination jobs.

Im using echo as the program again. echo finalDocument gt document codepre  pThere are two problems. The most important is the second sed thinks that the text in the string updatedDocumentText is the name of a file.

Negative 1817 pThis is a common problem when the query allows you to sort a column by passedin arguments. Below is what I am trying with ColdFusion ORM. I know that doing this will add a security loophole for SQL injection. Since ORDER BY cannot put on parameter we have to append it in the query itself. I have already escaped some vulnerable characters but still I cannot say that is safe from SQL injection. ESAPI provides the function codeencodeForSQLcode but this doesnt work SQL Server it works with MYSQL though.p  pAnother approach I normally use is that instead of passing a column name in the arguments, I pass some numeric value and use switchcase to match the proper column name... but this is an increase in maintenance.p  pIs there any good method for escaping sorting parameters in SQL or HQL when we cannot use named parametersp  precodeltcfscriptgt     var gridstruct       var isPaging  0     var hql  FROM tbl6 order by arguments.sortcolumn           x  entitytoqueryORMexecuteQueryhql,false ltcfscriptgt codepre

Negative 1817 pI have an interesting issue Im trying to figure out. I have a large program and in part of that program Im making a .xml file and writing to it just using strings no lxml or anything. I took that specific code out into its own program for testing and am running into an issue.  The code isp  precodeimport os directory  FileDirectory name  Test File.xml  if not os.path.existsKJOBS  directory  XML Files     os.makedirsKJOBS  directory  XML Files xmlJob  openKJOBS  directory  XML Files  name, w try     xmlJob.writeTest write except     print Unexpected error, sys.excinfo[0]     raise xmlJob.close codepre  pThe code runs through, doesnt give me any errors, the except doesnt trigger, but while the file is made there is nothing written in it. Also I can not delete the file without closing Python first so the .close doesnt seem to be happening either. But if I put print statements after the .write and the .close they both trigger so the program supposedly hits all the lines. The above text is the entire program so theres nothing else to be messing with it.p  pNow, when I changed to using with everything works. So the codep  precodeimport os directory  FileDirectory name  Test File.xml  with openKJOBS  directory  XML Files  name, w as xmlJob     xmlJob.writeTest write codepre  pruns fine. So obviously I can use the with instead of the open and .close, but at this point in time I want to figure out why the first option failed. Ive used practically the exact same code in other programs to write to log files and such and its worked then. Anyone have any ideasp

Negative 1817 pI have very serious problem to address. I have a list of 75000 words. Each word is assigned with a number for easy identification. First word is assigned with 0, last word is assigned with 75000. Now, I have a list of sentences. Lets take 1 sentence for an example.p  precodeI have big dog codepre  pWhen you represent this with assigned numbers, it become code20 123 2332 3434code.

We felt that saving long numbers like code20 123 2332 3434code for 2 billion records will take a huge space. Instead, if we can represent them using a shorter number system like codeF3x G6e rRrcode it will save our storage space. p  pHow can I achieve this May be using Hexadecimal numbers I used a hrefhttpwww.statman.infoconversionshexadecimal.html relnofollowthisa converter and it seems  there is no much difference because number strong123456strong in hexadecimal is strong1e240strong number strong75000strong in hexadecimal is strong124f8strong and so on seems like the number of characters are the same, so I am not sure whether it is going to save any space.p  pPlease provide me your advice to achieve this task.

Negative 1817 pIn ASP.NET Web API 2, the codeIHttpActionResultcode offers a lot of value in simplifying controller code and Im reluctant to stop using it, but Ive hit a problem. p  pI need to set an ETag on an outgoing response, and I cannot find any property which gives me access to the responses headers.

Negative 1817 pHi this was a question from magento forum on their site.. However I am looking for the same thing for a while, could any answer this p  pstrongI need the exact area in which Magento adds Base price and Custom option price strongp  blockquote   pI have been looking across these forums so many apologies if this is a   duplicate, but I am having a lot of trouble with the custom option   pricing on frontend not being absolute, but adding itself onto the   base price of the product.p      pI have been looking at a few modules, which I am happy to purchase, if   easy to implement, but there are quite a few that are going around.p      pAttached are some images if anyone has a solution.p      pThe base price on the product is a product with many different custom   options, could be size options also is 7.32, which is fine as the   page states From 7.32p      pHowever, there are a few options selectable, which rather than show    and ultimately add to the base price, should show the actual price   and not onto of the base price.p      pSo Rhynogrip 70 x 198 price is actually 48.96, however when selected   it adds this to the 7.32, rather than replace it. The attached all   show this.p      pIf anyone could help that would be greatp      pThanks in advance.p blockquote

Negative 1817 pI work daily on a large customized version of Android.  Our work involves creating new APIs and testing them with our inhouse test app.  Currently, each person checks out the needed files to make API updates and then requests that I create a new version of the test app that works with their changes.  The way I accomplish this, in part, is with a script that grabs their version of the OS files the ones that declare the APIs and generates a JAR of these files that is then thrown in the test apps lib directory so the test code can reference these newchanged APIs.  p  pIve been able to automate so much of my workflow, but strongemI cant find a way to automate the task of generating the jar from a few .java files that cant be compiled in isolationemstrong.  I know how to create a jar and manually populate it, but I cant figure out how Eclipse is able to generate .class files for .java input source files that cant be compiled by themselves.  The only way that I can currently compile these files is with a multihour full OS build, which I dont want to wait on.  Also, our build servers dont spit out the individual .class files I would want to zip up in a JAR anyways.p  pSo, does anyone know how to generate a JAR file with .class files compiled from .java src files that appear, by themselves, to be riddled with errors  I currently do this manually with Eclipses export project to JAR ability, but it really irks me that its the only nonautomateable step in my process so far.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8828493howtodoeclipsesexportjarfromthecommandlinethisa, which doesnt handle generation of the .class files from a set of .java files that wont compile alone.p  pThanksp

Negative 1817 pI have a codeConcurrentMapltKey, Longgtcode that is a cache from some key to the greatest value for it that has been seen so far. If two values come in at once, I want to ensure that the larger one is inserted into the map. Whats the cleanest way to do thisp  pOne ugly way is to write a class codeLargestLongcode with an codeUpdateIfBiggercode method, that will probably involve some CAS loop. I dont see a way to do such a CAS loop on a codeConcurrentHashMapcode directly.p  pOr use a codeConcurrentMapltKey, AtomicLonggtcode and a CAS loop after retrieval.

I figured it might just be something likep  precode    button.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, function1 ampamp function2 codepre  pUnfortunately that doesnt work. Do i need to call a new function that contains those two For examplep  precode   button.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, function3    function function3        function1        function2     codepre  pThe latter seems very inefficient so i assume there is a way to do it like the prior.p

Negative 1817 pWe have a part of our web app that displays a list of actionable items Jobs needing to be worked on. Our model of each Job looks like thisp  precode   JobUID Number,   State String,   FirstName String,   LastName String,   DateOfBirth dateTime,   DateReceived dateTime,   LastWorked dateTime,   UserName String,   ProblemText String,    AssignedTo String,   DateAdded dateTime,   CallOutStatusUID Number,   Notes [            NoteUID Number,       EntityUID Number,       Content String,       UserName String,       EntityTypeUID Number,       CreatedDateTime dateTime        ]  codepre  pThere can be 0..n codeNotescode. We ask a service through AJAX for all these jobs and use them to fill out a table. Were using the jQuery TableSorter plugin on the table these jobs are going into.p  pRecently the list has grown to 735 of these jobs with a total of 907 Notes, fiddler reports 450 KB of data was transferred. The table is on a different tab than the starting tab of the page. When you click on the tab that will display this table, IE freezes. To clarify, these are HTML tabs all on one page inside of IE. They are not multiple IE tabs.p  pIE does not steadily grow in memory when you try to switch tabs it sits at about 98MB. The process sits at 13 processor usage on an 8 core machine, which tells me that its doing everything on a single core since 13 is 18. The process never starts responding again and must be closed with task manager. When hooked to Visual Studio 2012, if I attempt to pause and debug while its like this, VS reports that its currently in Native Code. I tried setting a javascript breakpoint before the freeze and stepping into the freeze, but other than a few behind the scenes jquery calls, it does seem to actually be hanging in Native Code.p  pOur quick fix for awhile was to only show 200 of the jobs at a time and it worked but we want a way to be able to display all jobs. I started working with TableSorters Pager plugin but it didnt help. The sorter is set to only show 10 rows per page. If, before attempting to change tabs, I check how many rows are in that table, it successfully reports 12 10 rows per page  1 header row  1 filtering row.p  pHeres how I set up the table codeproblemscode is an array of the above modelp  precodefor var i  0 i lt problems.length i      var style  odd     if i  2  style  even      var problem  problems[i]     rows  lttr class  style  gtlttdgt     rows  problem.FirstName     rows  lttdgtlttdgt     rows  problem.LastName     rows  lttdgtlttdgt     rows  problem.DateOfBirth     rows  lttdgtlttdgt     rows  problem.ProblemText     if problem.CallOutStatusUID  null          rows      GetTypecallOutStatus, problem.CallOutStatusUID.Display          rows  lttdgtlttd styletextaligncenterwidth30pxgt     if problem.Notes.length gt 0          rows  lta href onclickgetNotesclickthis, JobUID, GetJob, problems idnotes  problem.JobUID   JobUID  problem.JobUID   classlnkNotesgtltimg srcimagesiconnote.pnggtltagt          rows  lttdgtlttdgt     if problem.AssignedTo  null ampamp problem.AssignedTo.toUpperCase  userName.toUpperCase ampamp problem.State.toUpperCase  WORKING          rows  lta hrefimageviewerJobUID  problem.JobUID  gtRead Onlyltagt          else          rows  lta hrefimageviewerJobUID  problem.JobUID  gtGet Workltagt          rows  lttdgtlttdgt     rows  problem.LastWorked     rows  lttdgtlttdgt     rows  problem.AssignedTo     rows  lttdgtlttdgt     rows  problem.DateReceived     rows  lttdgtlttrgt  ListOfJobs tbody.htmlrows.triggerupdate codepre  pOddly enough, when setting up this same scenario in our dev environment instead of prod where we found the problem, we could have upwards of 1000 jobs with over 2000 total notes and it would display properly. Ive tried deleting the large array after its put into the DOM but nothing changes. Ive also tried deleting coderowscode but again, nothing. There are multiple tabs other and I can switch between all tabs freely and the page seems to work up until I try to open the tab containing this table. Changing browsers is not an option. I cant even test in other browsers because our AJAX calls mess up in them and we cant reach this point where we have all the data and want to switch tabs. We dont support IElt10. We do have one dev running IE11 and it also breaks in exactly the same way.p  pWhats causing IE to freezep  pEDIT I tried changing the last line so that it didnt call the trigger and now the tab loads just fine. Anybody know enough about TableSorter to know why this trigger would have these kinds of issuesp  pEDIT 2 I redownloaded the tablesorter files and it turns out Im definitely not using the newest ones. When I switch using the newer ones, everything works fine.p

Negative 1817 pIve been having issues making this work. For a normal mesh I would set material property to THREE.FrontSide, that doesnt seem to do the job for text.p  pWhat Ive done while working on this once earlier was calculating the angle between the normal of the text mesh and vector pointing from camera towards text mesh on each camera update. I cant seem to get that to work right now because I dont know world coordinates of the mesh because its being added as child later on in the process.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is preventing text being viewed from the back and having the letters be backwards. The idea was that I have two meshes with one sided materials or flipping the mesh when I detect camera is looking at it from the back.p  pIf the rotation seems to be the right approach I doubt it is...

Negative 1817 pIm working with a .net DLL Ive created previously as an interface between a serial device programmable MCU and MATLAB Example operation 1. MATLAB sends a open port request via the DLL to the serial port,  2. The port is opened in the DLL and MATLAB have no control over the port only the DLL has, 3. MATLAB sends additional requests like read, write etc... to the DLL and it responds accordingly  4. MATLAB sends a close port request via the DLL to the serial port,  5. The port is closed BUT still occupied by the DLL.p  pThe problem is that since the DLL is inside MATLAB and it cannot be unloaded MATLAB, as stated in the MATHWORKS website, doesnt support unloading an already loaded .net DLL and MATLAB cannot control the port directly, the port is unavailable until MATLAB is closed and the DLL is unloaded happens only when MATLAB closes. This means that the user needs to close MATLAB a couple of times...p  pSo, is their any workaround way to unload the DLL or any another solutionp  pP.S, MATLAB has some serial capabilities but they are very limited in performance data acquisition for example hence they cannot be used also, the DAQToolbox is good but costs alot.p
Negative 1817 pI am an android user and of course I use whatsapp, twitter for android, facebook and many other apps that notify me of events. As a proogramer whats keeps me wondering is how fast notifications or whatsapp messages arrive. My intuition tells me that is not possible for the whatsapp or twitter server to open a TCP connection with my cellphone by a given port to deliver a new message. If i am in wifi mode the router would block that connection. And if my whatsapp client is pooling the server every second.... Poor server if it has 1000 clients making request every second.p  pWhat is the approach to face this issue. Is there some other protocol involved.p
Negative 1817 pI have inherited a test project with thousands of test methods  classes and I need to implement a new clean up procedure that needs to run after or before every test.

Negative 1817 pSo,p  pI have an issue with needing to make multiple http requests i mean 100s, even 1000s using PHP, and these requests need to be run through a proxy to protect the server infoip.p  pSo, the problem is, to do these requests using php curl is perfectly fine, but takes a long time. If i use php curlmulti, it takes a lot less time. But if i introduce the PROXY to this, the curlmulti takes a significantly longer time than not using curlmulti curl one after another.p  precodech  curlinit  curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHEADER, TRUE curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, FALSE curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIESESSION, TRUE curlsetoptch, CURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATION, TRUE curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, TRUE curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, REQUEST[url]  Proxy proxyStr  userpass123.123.123.12380  usernamepasswordipport curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPROXY, proxyStr  curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPROXYTYPE, HTTP curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHTTPPROXYTUNNEL, 1 req  something somethingelse rn request that needs to be sent curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCUSTOMREQUEST, req  Query  result  curlexecch  This is some sample code, obviously the curlmulti is using curlmultiinit and curlmultiexec Here is a sample code for curlmulti, just introduce the proxy code in the middle of it httpwww.phpied.comsimultaneuoshttprequestsinphpwithcurl codepre  pMy question is, what am i doing wrong The curlmulti with proxy takes a HUGE amount of time longer regardless of if i use 2 at a time or 5 at a time. But using multi with 1 at a time is quicker not quick enough but a LOT quicker than 2 or more.p  pAs a poor mans multithreading, i added a worker script to the server which pretty much takes a http post and does a single curl on the data post contains the proxy, so this worker uses the proxy. And using the main server, i use curlmulti to POST details to the worker script about 25 requests at a time. This method works better but not a huge amount better. Eg. if i use curlmulti to send 10 requests 1 at a time to the worker, it finishes in 10 secs. If i send 10 requests 5 at a time, it finished in 89 Secs. So its definitely faster, but not as fast as i need it to be.p  pDoes anyone have any ideassuggestions on why this is the casep  pIs there something about php curlmulti and proxies that im missing And I assumed that multiple PHP requests coming INTO a server would execute in parallel thus why i was reffering to curlmultiing into the worker script which does the proxy as a poor mans multithreading. Anyone suggesting on using pthreads, will that actually solve the problem it is not practical for me to install pthreads, but from what i can see, i doubt it would solve the problemp

What I  want is to create Listener Objects which are able to listen to certain notifications and outputs messages into a textbox on a form which holds the object.p  pThis is the ListenerObject implementation so farp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Diagnostics using Npgsql  namespace DBNotificationTests    public class TestListener        public delegate void TextOutputHandlerstring msg       private properties      private string name     private string listenerId      use false as standard here      private bool ignoreSelfEvents  false       private connection      private NpgsqlConnection dbConn       private handler      private NotificationEventHandler notifyEventHandler     private TextOutputHandler textOutputHandler      public string ListenerName            get                return this.name                  public string ListenerID            get                return this.listenerId                  public bool IgnoreSelfEvents            get                return this.ignoreSelfEvents              set                this.ignoreSelfEvents  value                  public TestListenerNpgsqlConnection c, string listenerName, NotificationEventHandler notifyEventHandler, TextOutputHandler textOutput  null            this.notifyEventHandler  notifyEventHandler        reference of the database interface        this.dbConn  c        set name        this.name  listenerName        set some unique listener ID        this.listenerId    new Random.Next  Process.GetCurrentProcess.Id.ToStringx2    this.name    new Random.Next  Process.GetCurrentProcess.Id.ToStringx          assign text output handler        this.textOutputHandler  textOutput           public void startListener             register Listener in DB       NpgsqlCommand registerListener  new NpgsqlCommandLISTEN   this.name  , this.dbConn       registerListener.ExecuteNonQuery        assign event handler        this.dbConn.Notification  notifyEventHandler        delegate message if handler is assigned        if this.textOutputHandler  null                 textOutputHandlerstarted to listen to Notification Eventsn                  public void stopListener             unregister Listener in DB        NpgsqlCommand unregisterListener  new NpgsqlCommandUNLISTEN   this.name  , this.dbConn       unregisterListener.ExecuteNonQuery        deassign registered event        this.dbConn.Notification  notifyEventHandler        delegate message if handler is assigned        if this.textOutputHandler  null                textOutputHandlerstopped to listen to Notification Eventsn                  public void notifyListenersstring notifyParams             notify listeners        NpgsqlCommand notifyDBListeners  new NpgsqlCommandNOTIFY   this.name  ,   this.listenerId    notifyParams  , this.dbConn       notifyDBListeners.ExecuteNonQuery          codepre  pThe From itself creates an instance of this object herep  precodepublic Form1    InitializeComponent   dbCon  new NpgsqlConnection   tstList  new TestListenerdbCon, TestListener, myNotifyEventHandler, textOutputHandler   tstList.IgnoreSelfEvents  true  codepre  pWith this regarding textOutputHandlerp  precodeprivate void textOutputHandlerstring msg    rtbEvents.SelectionFont  new FontrtbEvents.Font, FontStyle.Bold   rtbEvents.SelectedText  getCurrentTimestamp   rtbEvents.SelectionFont  new FontrtbEvents.Font, FontStyle.Italic   rtbEvents.SelectionColor  Color.Red   rtbEvents.SelectedText     this.tstList.ListenerName      rtbEvents.SelectionFont  new FontrtbEvents.Font, FontStyle.Regular   rtbEvents.SelectionColor  Color.Black   rtbEvents.SelectedText  msg  codepre  pAs I said initially  when using this implementation in a Release build its working fine.

Negative 1817 pI was accustomed to using GlassFish server all the times.

Negative 1817 pToday i tried adding a slider below my graph, so different graphs would be drawn when you slide it. Eventually i got all of this to work perfectly fine, however i still have two small issues. On top of the figure with the slider, the figure toolbar is gone. It can easily be added by clicking view  figure toolbar at the top in the figure itself. However to do this everytime is a bit tedious. And when i googled for the problem, the results where are all guides to create custom toolbars. I just want to add the default toolbar back, it was fine. But i do not know how to do that. Typing uitoolbar gives an empty one. But i am not sure how to fill it with the default icons.p  pAnd the second problem i ran into The main script calls in the end for a function, this function then creates the new graph with the slider. However herefore i needed to transfer the matrix of data to plot from the main script to the function, so i made the matrix a global variable. However as soon as the function is called, matlab gives me this error once for each global variablep  precodegt In xxxx at 270  Warning The value of local variables may have been changed to match the globals.

Negative 1817 pI am using momentary switches wired to GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi to control 4 LEDs. I have five buttons wired up. The first 4 buttons when pressed toggle the state of a connected LED from on to off or off to on depending on the current state. The fifth button turns on all 4 LEDs or turns off all 4 LEDs based on the onoff state of GPIO 18. I also have an extra LED wired to GPIO pin 18, this simply turns on or off based on the state of pin 18. The idea of this project is to be able to independently control the LEDs and have a master control button as well. The LED attached to pin 18 is a monitoring LED, it should be on if ANY of the 4 LEDs is on and it should only be off if all 4 of the LEDs are off simultaneously.  This is all based on python scripts that monitor for button presses and act accordingly.p  pThe code Ive written to control all LEDs at once looks like thisp  precodeimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO import time  GPIO.setwarningsFalse  GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM  GPIO.setup26, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP  chanlist  4,17,22,27  GPIO.setupchanlist,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.outputchanlist,0  GPIO.setup18,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.output18,0  while True     inputstate  GPIO.input26     if inputstate  False          chanlist  4,17,22,27          GPIO.output18, not GPIO.input18          time.sleep0.1          GPIO.outputchanlist, GPIO.input18          time.sleep0.4 codepre  pThis code appears to operate perfectly. As you can see it toggles the current state of pin 18 and then applies that state to pins 4,17,22 and 27 which are the pins the LEDs are connected to.p  pThe code Ive written to control the individual LEDs is a bit more complicated and it looks like thisp  precodeimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO import time  GPIO.setwarningsFalse  GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM  GPIO.setup5, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP  GPIO.setup4,GPIO.OUT GPIO.output4,0  GPIO.setup17,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.setup22,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.setup27,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.setup18,GPIO.OUT  while True     inputstate  GPIO.input5     if inputstate  False         if GPIO.output17,0  False             GPIO.output4, not GPIO.input4         elif GPIO.output22,0  False             GPIO.output4, not GPIO.input4         elif GPIO.output27,0  False             GPIO.output4, not GPIO.input4         else             GPIO.output4, not GPIO.input4             time.sleep0.1             GPIO.output18, GPIO.input4             time.sleep0.4 codepre  pThere are 4 versions of this with the pins adjusted, one version for each LED, This version uses pin 5 as an input to detect button presses and pin 4 as an output to activate the LED. What I want is to do is thisp  pWhen pressed if LED1 is off p  precode Toggle LED1 on, also toggle pin 18 on to activate the indicator light.  Take no further action. codepre  pWhen pressed if LED1 is on p  precode Check if pin 17 is on or off       If pin 17 is on toggle LED1 off and take no further action.       If pin 17 is off check if pin 22 is on or off           If pin 22 is on toggle LED1 off and take no further action.           If pin 22 is off check if pin 27 is on or off               If pin 27 is on toggle LED1 off and take no further action.               If pin 27 is off toggle LED1 off then set pin 18 to the current status of pin 4 LED1. codepre  pHowever, what is actually happening is thisp  pWhen pressed if LED1 is offp  precode Turns off all of the other 3 LEDs then toggles LED1 on and toggles pin 18 on. codepre  pWhen pressed if LED1 is offp  precode Turns off all LEDs and toggles pin 18 off. codepre  pI can not for the life of me figure this out. Your help is hugely appreciated.p  pP.S. Pardon my ignorance, I started learning python yesterday and have no prior programming experience at all. Im sure its something simple but I cant seem to solve it.p

Negative 1817 pIm working for a client which has 3 websites and multiple storeviews each.

Negative 1817 pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pI was always wondering if there is some kind of a standard, specification or perhaps a CSS framework with definitions or guidelines on how to add uniform vertical spacing between elementsp  pWhen I think about coding for the web I always imagine it as a nice grid, where there is an uniform horizontal gutter between columns or horizontally stacked elements, and again an uniform vertical gutter between elements.p  pBut what would be the best way to achieve this, preferably in conjunction with using Twitter Bootstrap for a WordPress themep  hr  pstrongMargin Collapsingstrongp  pMy first thought is always to set codemargintop 50px marginbottom 50pxcode on elements. Then, when they flow one under another they would always have exactly code50pxcode gutter between them thanks to a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebCSSmargincollapsing relnofollowmargin collapsinga.p  pI still think this is a really nice approach as you wouldnt have to worry if the element is the first one, the last one or somewhere in between.p  pFurthermore, even if you nest elements, the margins would still collapsep  pSee the following example with nested elements which use paddings instead of margins which do not collapse a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8wwrwy90 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net8wwrwy90ap  pYou can clearly see that the vertical gutters are anything but uniform.p  pNow see the same example with margins, which do collapse a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9rLaLso71 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net9rLaLso71ap  pNo matter how deep you nest, the margins collapse up to the root element and the gutter stays uniform. Its simply beautiful.p  hr  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pAs you can probably imagine there is an issue with this approach, which is exactly where Im stuck. Margins only collapse under certain conditions and a lot of things can break it, from having clearance, through having set vertical paddings, to floating.p  pSo, my general issue is with the otherwise awesome Twitter Bootstrap grid system. Simply said, columns use codefloat leftcode, so from the moment you enter a column there is no more margin collapsing.p  pThat simply breaks everything.p  pSo, Ive started looking for hacks around this issue, but havent really found a good solution just yet.p  pJust so you would visualize the issue, heres a fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net19Leuhsq1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net19Leuhsq1ap  pI emgoodem solution would be one that would either allow for collapsing which I believe cant happen with how the current grid system is made or compensate for it. It would also be nice if one would be able to nest rows into rows into rows... and still get the same result, visually.p  pFor me, it is important to be able to use any element anywhere as the markup will be automatically generated and built by the user from the admin panel in WordPress. So, I could not really rely on hardcoding distances or too complex rules like emif this is in thatem or emif that follows that, but has no children or is the last elementem etc.p  hr  pstrongWrap Upstrongp  pId really appreciate it if anyone would be able to point me into the right direction. Perhaps my approach is wrong, perhaps there is or there is no standard solution...p  pI am open to any and all suggestions.p
Negative 1817 pIm faced with an interesting situation that at first seems difficultimpossible but I figured Id through the noodle at the wall and see if it sticks to any of you.p  pIm working on an AdHoc reporting project, a portion of with is creating very simple SSRS Report Parts based on some views in our database. Theyre all tablixes, created to satisfy the clients style standards. Theyre essentially just a Select top 1000 statement, where the view has made friendly aliases on some columns. The report parts and their datasets are located on a reporting server, split into a couple different modules ranging from 422 report parts per module.p  pI created manual test scripts for these, and the testers are bucking. While it is their only job, its also pretty time consuming so I understand where theyre coming from. Theyd like me to develop an automated test utility, and my googling has returned nothing.p  pHas anyone worked on automated testing for report parts In my head I imagine some C executable that asks the user to point to a folder full of report parts either locally or on a report server, and makes sure that they actually would work if inserted in Report Builder, that they return X number of rows or maybe even compares them with the view definitions. Ive seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions743950howtoautomatetestsforreportsinssrsTHISa question on SO but testing a traditional SSRS report would definitely be different than making sure a Report Part runs, so I dont think selenium or another webbased testing framework is the solution But if it is, let me know.p  pPlease feel free to ask any clarifying questions or to provide any suggestion, no matter how ridiculous it may first appear.p

Negative 1817 pIve watched Laracasts video about presenters and I want to use them in my project.p  pI have a page where I display user activity log. In foreach loop I display activity model. Activity uses polymorphic relationship, so depending on the activity type I need to display different kind of content. For example, user may send email, add task, create something, delete something etc.p  pDepending on the action I should display different icons, different content itself some activities may contain links, some may contain something else.p  pWhen I watched and read examples of presenters, I realize that all of them  are quite simple and uses such things as codeucfirstcode or dateformatting. However, should I put a lot of HTML logic in my presenters For example, since I have different icon for different actions I put big switch which returns codeltigtcode tag with appropriate icon class. Then, when displaying description of the action I switch as well and return some html, like links, even probably codeltaudiogtcode tag.p  pAlso this is not convenient to use HTML in presenters, but at the same time I want to keep my view clean, so that I can just output codeactivitygtpresentergtdescriptioncode instead of a lot of codeifcode operators.p  pAn example of presenter methodp  precodepublic function icon      switch thisgtentitygttypegtname          case call return lti classfa faphone activitycallicongtltigt         case visit return lti classfa facar activityvisiticongtltigt         case email return lti classfa fasend activityemailicongtltigt         case note return lti classfa fapencil activitytaskicongtltigt         case createcheckin return lti classflaticonpin56gtltigt         default return lti classfa fadotcircleogtltigt       codepre

Negative 1817 pI am trying to get a random array with numbers placed on a highcharts chart, in the form of a Bell Curve. Sounds simple, but i have trouble figuring out what to use on the y axis, since the categories should be the values, or atleast i think so.p  pMy gaussian function, i am aware it might not be correct, but it gives me an array which i am trying to place in a highcharts spline chart.p  precode    for i  0 i lt 100 i          array[]  rand1, 1000           std  10     function likelyHoodarray, std           mean  int roundminarray  maxarray  2          standard  maxarray  minarray  std          fori  1 i lt std1.99 i              before[]  int roundmean  standardi                    after[]  int roundmean  standardi                          before  arrayreversebefore, true         result  arraymergearraybefore, arraymean, arrayafter         return result      codepre  pThis gives me something like thisp  precodeArray      [0] gt 1     [1] gt 100     [2] gt 199     [3] gt 298     [4] gt 397     [5] gt 496     [6] gt 595     [7] gt 694     [8] gt 793     [9] gt 892     [10] gt 991  codepre  pWhich i use for my X axis in my chart.

Negative 1817 pIve been thinking about the return values of these two functions.  The syncboolcompareandswap functions return value seems to have obvious benefits, i.e. I can use it to tell whether the swap operation took place.  However I cant see a good use of syncvalcompareandswaps return value.p  pFirstly, lets have a function signature for reference from GCC docs minus the var argsp  precodetype syncvalcompareandswap type ptr, type oldval type newval codepre  pThe problem I see is that the return value of syncvalcompareandswap is the old value of the ptr.  To be precise, its the value which was seen by the implementation of this function once appropriate memory barriers had been put in place.  I explicitly state this to cater for the fact that between calling syncvalcompareandswap and executing instructions to enforce the memory barrier the value of ptr could easily change.p  pNow, when the function returns what can I do with that return value  Theres no point trying to compare it to ptr because ptr can now be changed on other threads.  Likewise comparing newval and ptr doesnt really help me either unless I lock ptr which probably undermines my use of atomics in the first place.p  pSo all thats really left for me to do is ask whether the return value  oldval, which is effectively see below for a caveat asking whether the swap operation took place.  So I could have just used syncboolcompareandswap.   p  pThe caveat I just mentioned is that the only subtle difference I can see here is that doing so doesnt tell me whether the swap occured or not, it just tells me that at some point before the memory barrier was released ptr had the same value as newval.  Im considering the possibility that oldval  newval although Id struggle to see a way of implementing the function efficiently so that it could check these values first and not swap if they were the same so its probably a moot point.  However I cant see a situation where knowing this difference would make a difference to me at the call site.  In fact, I cant imagine a situation where I would set oldval and newval to be equal.  p  pMy question is thusp  pemIs there any use case in which using syncvalcompareandswap and syncboolcompareandswap would not be equivalent, i.e. is there a situation where one provides more information than the otheremp  pstrongASIDEstrongp  pThe reason I was thinking about this was that I found an implementation of syncvalcompareandswap in terms of syncboolcompareandswap which has a racep  precodeinline int32t syncvalcompareandswapvolatile int32t ptr, int32t oldval, int32t newval      int32t ret  ptr     voidsyncboolcompareandswapptr, oldval, newval     return ret  codepre  pThe race being on the storing of ptr in ret, as ptr could change before syncboolcompareandswap is called.  It made me realise that I there doesnt seem to be a safe way without extra barriers or locks of implementing syncvalcompareandswap in terms of syncboolcompareandswap.  This got me thinking that the former must provide more information than the latter, but as per my question I dont see that it really does.p

This time, I use semanticui validation to make sure the category name inputted is UNIQUE and therefore not yet in the DB and to make sure it is not EMPTY. If I enter a name that is unique, and click the submit button.  It passes the validation. It then calls the codeonSuccesscode callback as above and insert the category name into the MONGO DB database and because Meteor is REACTIVE, the page updates itself showing the new Category.p  pMy problem is that after calling the codeonSuccesscode callback, SemanticUI seem to validate the form again.  This puts me in a situation where the error messages are displayed again when it should not be. Im stuck in this situation....if I dont do anything and just leave the value of input field as it is when it was clicked, then the validation this time checks the value again against the value in the DB and it invalidates the form because the value is no longer UNIQUE as it has just been inserted. I have the option to make that input field empty again when codeonSuccesscode is called.  But if I do that, semantic UI complains that the field is empty and it should not be empty.p  pIdeally, I would like to write something inside the codeonSuccesscode callback to tell semanticui that it has done its job of validating that is why it has reached on onSuccess and PLEASE DONT REVALIDATE as it will show the error messages that I dont want displayed.....p  pIve tried puttingp  precodeform.formclear codepre  pandp  precodeform.formreset codepre  pinside codeonSuccesscode but I have found that the validation happens after codeonSuccesscode therefore resetting the form or clearing the form only makes the field empty and the semanticui form complains about not having a value for that field.p  pIs there a way around this Whats the solutionp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 1817 pI have a c windows form app written in .net4.0p  pI have a datagridview codedgvItemscode which I programmatically bind to a dataset and datatable at the end of an import function.p  pI have an import button that imports data from a selected excel file into a table called codedtItemAdjustListcode, once the data has been imported I bind that table to my grid. The code I use to bind the grid isp  precodedgvItems.DataSource  dsQtyAdjust dgvItems.DataMember  Item Adjust List dgvItems.Refresh codepre  pEverything works fine so far, if I edit the imported data in the datagridview, it updates the bound table codedtItemAdjustListcode after each cell is edited.p  pMy issue comes in when I try to manually add a row to my datagridview, it doesnt immediately add that new row to the bound datatable.p  pExample I put a break point at the end of my codedgvItemsCellValueChangedcode event and added a codedtItemAdjustList.Rows.Countcode watch and here is what happens.p  pAfter the data is imported and I edit one of the existing imported lines the watch shows the correct row count, lets say strong5strong.p  pNow I click the last  row, and type something into my item column and hit tab, the break point fires but my row count still only shows strong5strong, I fill out a few more cells in the new row but each time I leave a cell and my CellValueChanged event fires and the row count remains at strong5strong.p  pNext I add a second manual row, now immediately after I tab out of the first cell I filled out for this second new row, my row counter goes to strong6strong, but technically at this point Ive added strong2strong manual rows to my imported strong5strong, so the counter should read strong7strongp  pThis repeats, basically each new manually added row to the datagridview isnt added to the bound datatable until either strongastrong another row is added or strongbstrong I go back and reedit a cell on an existing row.p  pEdit Forgot to mention I tried binding my DataGridView two waysp  precodeDataSource  dsQtyAdjust dataset Name DataMember  Item Adjust List  Table Name in the dataset  DataSource  dtItemAdjustList codepre  pIt made no difference as far as my new row behaviour goes.p

Negative 1817 pI am designing an app to manage RabbitMQ workers given certain rules. For examplep  ul liMaintain a minimum number of workersli liSpawn up to N max number of workers if queue grows beyond M tasksli liKill workers older than X minutesli ul  pI originally thought of writing it in Go because it is compiled amp I could simply compile the app to the target OS amp daemonize it. However, my concept design involves having a loop that gathers data every Y seconds amp passes it through a decision engine. The engine would then raise events that would be listened to by other goroutines to either spawn or kill workers.p  pIve found the a hrefhttpsgithub.comchuckpreslaremission relnofollowEmissiona library which would acommodate this, but I read a comment somewhere that it might not be thread safe. Honestly, my knowledge of Go amp threaded programming are not sufficient to properly evaluate if this library would accomplish what I need or if this is even possible in Go.p  pI could write this very quickly in NodeJS and even get it compiled using a hrefhttpsgithub.comcrcnnexe relnofollownexea. However, I wanted to learn a new language, I liked the targeted compilation in Go, and that it can be multithreaded beyond the goroutines themselves.p  pIs this possible or am I trying to shoehorn something into Go that it wasnt designed to do Would it be better to accomplish the same goals differently or to just use a different language all togetherp

Negative 1817 pI have spent big time on related questionsanswers in stakcoverflow and android doc from google on about adding or deleting pages at RANDOM positions in FragmentStatePagerAdapter.br It works fine but fails for one scenario.br Scenario1 that worksbr Add, say, 4 pages Fragments.br Delete the page at last position that is at position 3.br Add one more page at the end of page again.br Delete the page at last position that is at position 3.br . I repeat this steps and it works perfectly fine.  p  pBut scenario2 it failsbr Add, say, 4 pages Fragments.br Delete any page other than last position, say, position 2. Works fine.   Page is no more seen.br Add one more page at the end of page again. FAILED here..I see blank page.  p  pI did analyse it to some extent and I could find that getItem is not being called when it failed. As getItem is the one which creates and returns the new fragment so it does not get the new fragment so it shows blank. I saw the implementation of instantiateItem and observed that getItem is not called if the size of the available no of fragments is more than the position requested to create the fragment for. But not sure when it happens or how.p  pHere is my getItem and getItemPosition from my adapter.

Negative 1817 pI am using WebdriverIO with Javascript and Mocha to create a UI test framework. For that, I am trying to capture screenshots every time a page loads or a page refreshes. Could someone please tell me if this is possible to do it using WebdriverIO or otherwisep  pRelevant details The pages are NOT loaded using driver.url all the time. The launching URL is arrived at using driver.url, and then on all navigation happen by clicking on a link on a page or performing an action that leads to another page load. Please also note that page load happens on other conditions as well, for example, when a Save button is clicked the same page loads again refreshes. I am trying to capture a screenshot every time a page loads or refreshes irrespective of whatever action that might cause it. And thats why I want to abstract out the process at a global level than calling driver.saveScreenShot in multiple places all over the codebase.p

Negative 1817 pI am using Mibew as a support chat in my site and now I would like to allow users to chat with each other.p  pI read in a comment on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq152368683494439this questiona that you can do it, but I have no idea where to start.p  pUsers must login to access my site, so I know all users online and which users can chat with each.p  pIn Mibew you can start a chat by typing the Operator Code. I would like to allow users to type the username they would like to chat with and start a chat between them. p  pIn the best solution, their conversation would not be available to us or would be encrypted, but if that is not possible I will add a disclaimer to warn them that the chat is only for professional usage and is being recorded. p
