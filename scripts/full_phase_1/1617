Positive 1617 pI am writing a program that is to convert infix to postfix and calculate the expression. For conversion I am using a linklist stack. The one problem I am having with the project is the fact that the stack heads can only be declared locally. The stack heads are a pointer to my stack struct that point to the first value in the link list stack. My linked list stack struct is globally declared.p  pSo for example,p  precodeint evaluateparam1,param2 declare my 1st stack head here declare my 2nd stack head here.  codepre  pI am using 2 stacks, 1 for value inputs and 1 for the characteroperation inputs. I am just getting confused on how to access these stacks outside of the evaluate function. My instructor was hinting that we needed to use double pointer notation in calling other functions, I sort of understand the idea but would love if anyone could explain further.p  precodeIf I have a function  popstackstackhow do i call this parameter is it stack stack   or ampstack codepre  pBasically I am confused on how to go about the pointer notation, whether it be pointer to pointer, or the adress of the pointer. p

Positive 1617 pFor a project I have to use the following definition of Fork void ForkVoidFunctionPtr func, int arg.  I need to pass a struct in as the arg so that I can give the forked function more information, but I keep getting errors because a struct is not a int.

If anyone knows how to trick the function into accepting the struct as an int or another way to accomplish the goal of having shared buffers between threads created by this version of Fork please let me know.  P.S. I cannot use the C standard version of Fork because the programming I am doing is very low level.p

Positive 1617 pIm having a strange problem in C with a struct Im working.  One of the structs elements is a array of char arrays of size 3.  The element is meant to be a players hand and the char arrays are meant to be the individual cards.  Theyre formatted like 2C where 2 is the rank and C is a club.  My problems lies in a function thats creating the player hand from a given string.  In the loop j is meant to be the card index and at the end it assigns the created card which I know is correct to the index.  At the last iteration of the loop it assigns 4C and every one of the elements become 4C for some reason.

Negative 1617 pIm a little confused on the varying definitions and implementations of web services available as implementations. Need some clarification please.p  pstrongOnes I have used till nowstrongp  ol lipIf a vendor gives me a specific format of XML that I can send populated with data to request and I make a simple HTTP POST over the internet passing in the XML String as the payload, is this a web service call  If so, is there a specific name to it, this kind of web service  Because obviously, it does not use anything like Axis, WSDL or SOAP to establish this connection. pli lipA variant of this is If the vendor gives me an XSD, I use JAXB to make a java class out of it and pass in the serialized version of the object, which eventually works out to be the same as option 1.pli lipRESTful web service Vendor gives me a URL like a hrefhttprestfulserviceproductshttprestfulserviceproductsa and I can make HTTP Requests to the URL and depending on what HTTP verb I use, the appropropriate action is called and the response sent over the wire.pli ol  pstrongOnes I have only read about have a vague idea aboutstrongp  ol lipSOAP. How does this work.. Ive read the W3Schools tutorial and I undertsand that there is a very specific form of XML that is standardized according to W3C standards that we use to pass the same kind of messages as we did in option 1. But how does this work in real life Vendor sends me what Do I generate classes Do I serialize some objects and http post them over to an address Or do the generated objects themselves have connection methods that will do them for mepli lipWhat about WSDL When does a vendor send me WSDL and what do I do with it  I guess I can generate classes from it. If yes, then what do I do with the generated classes pli lipWhen do I need that axis jar to generate classes from something that the vendor sends pli ol  pAs you can see, I have some clear and other mostly vague ideas about the different kinds of web services available. would help if someone ould clarify andor point to more realworld resources.

Negative 1617 pI am in a scenario where I have to integrate with a 3rd party system here at my job that exposes Javabased web services. I can parse the service WSDL definitions and generate proxy classes and interact with them just fine in the .NET world. However, the services arent very clean in the sense that the property names in the Java apps object model are extremely convoluted and the servers that host the Java environment will sometimes go down and, being pointtopoint, my client apps dont enjoy it when the URI is not responding. I also wanted to not include the service implementation logic into my web app directly because there is lots of potential for reuse of these Java services since the business often asks for new things that utilize the same data.p  pSo, what I have did a while back was write some wrapper WCF services that handle the property mapping and provide our developers a better interface to develop against. However, this solution doesnt feel great because Id like to implement some routing and some other features and get away from the 11 wrapper WCF to Java service. Is there any good way to handle this a little more dynamically using WCF 4 features I think the biggest hurdle is the fact that I have no access to the Java services for changes and the developers that support that side arent familiar with much else than Java. Even trying to explain ESOSOA concepts is normally a lost cause.p  pAnyone else using WCF as a pseudo service gateway to 3rd party services If so, how do you handle the mapping of fields from your WCF data objects to the 3rd party service in a more dynamic way Are you using the WSDL from the 3rd party service to generate binding contracts and proxy classes in your WCF layerp  pThanks. I know this is a very broad question and there is no 100 right or wrong solution. Just looking for some feedback on this architecture. I see a lot of info on a WCF service interacting with other WCF services as a routing service, but not often where WCF routes or acts as a gateway to Javabased services.p  pAgain, here is my current architecture..p  p.NET client  WCF service mapping, property cleanup, and some minor biz logic  Javabased web service  source data large asset management systemp

Negative 1617 pIm trying to develop a standalone client app that uses web services in a Glassfish container Metro. About all I have to work from is a wsdl for the wervices Im trying to use. The wsdl is rife with all kinds of wspPolicy tags. Looks like IssuedToken, Trust13, ecryption are all utilized.  So I generated some code from netbeans and JAXWS. Everything went well, but when trying to run the client I get WST0029STS location could not be obtained from either IssuedToken or from client configuration for accessing the service a hrefhttplocalhost8080 relnofollowhttplocalhost8080a ....p  pThats when it occured to me that I know nothing about WSS. It doesnt look like any code was generated to deal with security. So, Ill have to go from scratch. So where to start Books Tutorialsp  pTIAp

Negative 1617 pI am getting a strange problem. I have a table that has a primary key that is generated in an INSTEAD OF trigger. Its probably the worst way to implement a primary key, but they basically fetch the maximum, increment it by 1, and use this value as the key. This happens in the instead of trigger. p  pI have a .Net app that starts a RepeatableRead transaction, and I insert a record into this table. This works fine as long as I dont try and do more than one insert simultaneously. If I do, I receive a PK violation error. It seems to me that the inserts both get fired, the trigger fetches the same last number for each transaction, increments it by 1, and then tries to insert both records with the same new identifier.p  pIve spoken to the DBA that set this trigger up, and he is of the opinion that RepeatableRead should stop this from happening as it apparently locks the table for reads and other transactions will wait for the locks to be released. So, in essence, my transactions will occur in serial. p  pSo, the question is, why would I be getting a PK violation if RepeatableRead works the way the DBA described itp

Negative 1617 pIn my app, numbers are displayed as pounds. I need to add an option to use kilograms instead. Does anyone know how to go about this Im using Core Data to store numbers. I know I can do it all manually by using an codeifcode statement then doing a conversion, but there must be better way. p  pstrongEDITstrong Actually, I think I ran into a huge problem.  It isnt as simple as converting numbers.  Because I am using a picker and I want to offer international imperial support, The picker should display whole, sensible numbers in kg.  If I just convert the numbers to kg, I will get decimal numbers which people will not know how to use.  Any suggestionsp

Each service user has a set schedule of when they are to be visited which includes periods plus the visit duration in minutes.p  pSo for example, a service user could have the following schedule.p  precode      AM   Lunch   Tea   Late   Night   Respite Mon   30m         30m   60m            Tue   30m              60m            Wed   20m  25m     30m   60m    120m     Thu              30m                 Fri   30m  25m                        Sat                                 Sun   20m  25m                        codepre  pThese periods are currently stored in a database in the following formatp  precodeTable Serviceuserschedules id   serviceuserid   day   period   duration codepre  pEvery week, the carers fill out a table of what periods they are available to work. This data is then input into the system and is stored in the database in the following formatp  precodeTable Careravailableshifts id   carerid   day   period codepre  pNow the problem is, I need to create a controller that will take this data and automatically assign carers to service users based on the availability they have supplied. This needs to be editable so that in the event that nobody is available for a particular carer, the user can select one that isnt available and they will still be added to the database.p  pAt the moment, I have a mess of loops, functions and echos to check if carers are available for a particular service user and to make it editable.p  pHas anyone performed this sort of task before and if so, did you find a simple way to complete it. I would prefer to make it object orientated so I could reuse the same generic class but at the moment, Im at a complete lossp  pMany thanks in advance.p  pemEDIT I have now added a bounty to this question. I am currently researching genetic algorithms something that I have never even heard of let alone used as a solution to this problem based on some of the answers. I would like to know if any of you have used other methods of solving this type of problem or if you have used genetic algorithms, could you provide a less general explanation on how you applied them to this particular issue.emp  pemI would assume that this hurdle would be fairly common in many staffing type applications  and am surprised at how little discussion there is on this anywhere on the webemp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pstrongSorry for the late response guys. Thank you for your detailed answers, they have definitely got me interested in the use of GAs. For this particular project, I think I may end up using the database method as described by Tak but may possibly convert to the use of GAs in the future when I have more development time set aside. It is now definitely on my to learn list and your answers have given me a great start Cheersstrongp  pstrongI am now at a bit of a loss as to who to award the bounty to. duedl0r put alot of effort into his or her answer and I appreciate it a lot. It has given me a great insight into the world of Genetic Algorithms  a problem solving method that I had never come across before. However, the answer provided by Tak provides the solution that I will be using for this project. Therefore, I have awarded the bounty to Tak.strongp  pstrongThank you everybody.strongp

Negative 1617 pI want to be able to detect whether an image is transparent or not using the Imagick PHP extension.p  pSo far, the only luck Ive been having is to run the exec  some other command, and use the ImageMagick command line tool to achieve this.

Negative 1617 pIm writing an application that I will use to keep up with my monthly budget. This will be a C .NET 4.0 Winforms application.p  pEssentially my budget will be a matrix of data if you look at it visually. The columns are the dates at which that budget item will be spent. For example, I have 1 column for every Friday in the month. The Y axis is the name of the budget item Car payment, house payment, eating out, etc. There are also categories, which are used to group the budget item names that are similar. For example, a category called Housing would have budget items called Mortgage, Rent, Electricity, Home Insurance, etc.p  pI need a good way to store this data from a code design perspective. Basically Ive thought of two approachesp  pOne, I can have a BudgetItem class that has a Category, Value, and Date. I would have a linear list of these items and each time I wanted to find a value by either date or category, I iterate this list in some form or fashion to find the value. I could probably use LINQ for this.p  pSecond, I could use a 2D array which is indexed first by column date and second by row. Id have to maintain categories and budget item names in a separate list and join the data together when I do my lookups somehow.p  pWhat is the best way to store this data in code Im leaning more towards the first solution but I wanted to see what you guys think. Later on when I implement my data persistence, I want to be able to persist this data to SQL server emORem to an XML file one file per monthly budget.p  pThanksp
Negative 1617 pIm using Visual Studio 2010 to write and debug a small program. The problem is, whenever I start the application through Visual Studio 2010 the process of my application produces pagefaults in the range of 100000 per second and that slows down the program by factor 10 or more. When I start the generated executable from the file system no pagefaults are generated after the startup is complete. That happens with the debug and the all optimizations allowed release build. No exceptions are getting thrown.p  pThe program itself is compiled around 200kib and when executed holds around 10mib of data with over 4gib of memory available. There are only the main thread and the thread of the logging framework running. The data is loaded once at the start and after that only the results are stored in newly allocated memory and written to the log at the end.p  pThere does not seem to be a lot of disk activity and the Windows Resource Monitor indicates no hard faults, while the Task Manager shows ever increasing numbers. I know that some performance loss is to be expected for using an IDE, but this seems a little bit excessive. Any advicep  pstrongEditstrongp  pNote I was able to get the count down to about half by cutting down on deallocating new memory.p  pProcess Explorer says img srchttpi.imgur.comkxOpa.png altProcess Explorerp  pIt seems the debugger is at fault.

Negative 1617 pI have a custom 404 error page on my site, but while doing other things on the site, the error page makes it hard to figure out what my missing file problems are because it redirects to a given html or php file and takes the URL of the missing file out of the address bar and replaces it with the URL of the custom error page.p  pSo for example, when users log in to the site, I have it link to a php file when they hit submit, but then the browsers takes them straight to the 404 error page, so I cant see that the problem is actually a link to one directory higher than it should be.p  pIve tried printing the URL of the missing file to the page using php, but the server just grabs the URL of the 404 error page, rather than the original missing file URL. Here is how I tried doing that a hrefhttpmembers.cox.netmidiantutorialsphp404.htm relnofollowhttpmembers.cox.netmidiantutorialsphp404.htmap  pHow can I either show the custom error page while keeping the original missing URL in the address bar, or print out the URL of the missing file to the pagep

Negative 1617 pAm trying to create a simple servlet using servlet creation wizard in helioseclipse.

Negative 1617 pIm porting a Cbased engine from Android to iOS and I have some questions on how landscape mode on iOS devices work.p  pI can successfully start my device on landscape mode but my framebuffer stays on portrait mode no matter how I rotate it or force its rotation. For instance, I would expect a 960x640 resolution instead of the default 320x480.p  pIve been researching about it and I saw some people doing this but explicitly rotating the scene using OpenGL, which means the actual axis were not in landscape mode, which for me is an ugly workaround.p

Negative 1617 pI have an unusual project that I need to display large sets of questions to the user.  Given the amount of questions that will be shown on the screen and accessible by the user I have opted to using a codeListViewcode. I tried a codeScrollViewcode, but it wasnt as efficient as I wanted, and lagged when dynamically adding new sets of questions.p  pThe basic structure will be a codeListViewcode whose children are custom Views that I have created that have codeLinearLayoutscode inside that expand and collapse based on a button in each custom view. The codeLinearLayoutscode will hold the questions widgets, codeTextViewcodes, codeButtoncodes, codeEditTextcodes, etc. In each collapsible view there will be at least 20 widgets. There will be many custom views in the codeListViewcode. One problem I had was scrolling of the codeListViewcode when showing that many widgets.  It worked OK when the custom views were collapsed, but when a bunch were expanded it lagged the scroll.p  pIs there a more efficient way of displaying huge amounts of widgets than enclosing them in a codeListViewcode I thought codeListViewcode might be my best bet because it recycles the Views.p  pThis is a very unusual project, as the questions inside the codeListViewcode will change dramatically based on certain information entered by the user.p

Negative 1617 pI am totally baffled at the moment.p  pI have a Flash CS5AS3 project, a large Flash game, that uses a LOT of animations. Ive divided these up into a MovieClip on a Scene, with corresponding actionscripts and events, for the exploring screens, and another MovieClip on a Scene for one of the challenges, and another such set for another challenge. p  pThis method allows me to put only the animations that section needs into the corresponding MovieClip, and link the events of the scene to its MovieClip.p  pHowever, I obviously have to link these. I use the following to do itp  precodestop thismovieclip.stop gotoAndPlay1, THATSCENE codepre  pThe next movieclip starts automatically when the next scene shows up.p  pThis works well in theory. But, though the correct Scene shows up, that scenes movieclip is skipping erratically as opposed to playing smoothly, and its audiocues are playing, along with the audiocues from another movieclip that I neither called nor have on this Scene. Mind you, that movieclip hadnt even RUN yet.p  pWhat is going on How do I fix it I KNOW it is possible, but how do I do itp  pEDIT I did find a workaround that eliminates the use of scenes altogether, however if anyone has any useful information or possible solutions, they are encouraged to answerp

Negative 1617 pmy question is mainly about code optimizationat the moment I have created a network monitor that monitors different connections on the PC, what i had done is Im sniffing packets at the 3rd level of the stackthe network level, after capturing the packet, i am supposed to create an object on the UI for each connection, what i am doing at the moment is looking at the overall consumed bandwidth and total data sent every second the program is run. here is that part of the codep  precode    temp packetrtxt.TextLength         tempdr  temp  1024         drtxt.Texttempdr.ToString         totaldata  totaldata  temp         totaldatadisp  totaldata         packetrtxt.Text           unit         if totaldata lt 10485760                      if totaldata lt 10240                 unit.Text  bytes             else                              totaldatadisp  totaldatadisp  1024                 unit.Text  KBs                               else                      totaldata  totaldatadisp  1048576             unit.Text  MBs                  test.Text  totaldatadisp.ToString         tds.Enabled  true      codepre  pso what im doing so far is writing out the captured packets into a rich text box, taking the length of that rtxt and adding it to a counter for the total data, taking the length and using it as the data rate, then clearing the rtxt for the next bits of data. the total data recieved part is working fine, however the BPs section works fine for low amounts of data, then it goes crazy if the data rate is over 10kbpson my pc should i try optimizing the whole code, or is there some other methodkeep in mind i need to monitor every single connection, or do i need to use different UI controls should I focus on optimization or using new waysp  pthanks in advancep

From that I get something like thisp  precodepublic void Update      Matrix m1  new Matrix         p4.X, p4.Y, 1, 0,         p3.X, p3.Y, 1, 0,         p2.X, p2.Y, 1, 0,         0, 0, 0, 1     Matrix m2  new Matrix         p4.X, p4.Y, 1, 0,         p3.X, p3.Y, 1, 0,         p1.X, p1.Y, 1, 0,         0, 0, 0, 1     Matrix m3  new Matrix         p4.X, p4.Y, 1, 0,         p2.X, p2.Y, 1, 0,         p1.X, p1.Y, 1, 0,         0, 0, 0, 1     Matrix m4  new Matrix         p3.X, p3.Y, 1, 0,         p2.X, p2.Y, 1, 0,         p1.X, p1.Y, 1, 0,         0, 0, 0, 1      float det1  m1.Determinant     float det2  m2.Determinant     float det3  m3.Determinant     float det4  m4.Determinant      float tet1  det1  det3  det2  det2     float tet2  det2  det3  det1  det4     float tet3  det2  det4  det3  det3      float discr  4  tet1  tet3  tet2  tet2      if discr gt 0              Type  CurveTypes.Serpentine          float ls  2  det2         float lt  det3  float1  Math.Sqrt3  Math.Sqrt3  det3  det3  4  det2  det4         float ms  2  det2         float mt  det3  float1  Math.Sqrt3  Math.Sqrt3  det3  det3  4  det2  det4          TexCoord1  new Vector3lt  mt, floatMath.Powlt, 3, floatMath.Powmt, 3         TexCoord2  new Vector3ms  lt  ls  mt, 3  ls  lt  lt, 3  ms  mt  mt         TexCoord3  new Vector3ls  ms, 3  ls  ls  lt, 3  ms  ms  mt         TexCoord4  new Vector30, ls  ls  ls, ms  ms  ms          else if discr  0              Type  CurveTypes.Cusp          else if discr lt 0              Type  CurveTypes.Loop       codepre  pGuess what, that didnt work either. How ever, discr seem to be at least a little more correct now. At least it has the right sign, and it is zero when the control points are arranged to form a cusp. I still get the same visual result though, except the curve disappears randomly for a while the pixel shader formula is always greater than zero and returns after I move the control point back to more of a square shape.

Negative 1617 pQuoting Glenn Kastenp  pFor audio, theres a hard limit of 32 active AudioTrack objects per emdeviceem not per app you need to share those 32 with rest of the system, and AudioTrack is used internally beneath SoundPool, ToneGenerator, MediaPlayer, native audio based on OpenSL ES, etc. But the actual AudioTrack limit is lt 32 it depends more on soft factors such as memory, CPU load, etc. Also note that the limiter in the Android audio mixer does not currently have dynamic range compression, so it is possible to clip if you have a large number of active sounds and theyre all loud.p  pSo, practically, 1 MediaPlayer I use corresponds to 1 AudioTrack from the system.p  pImportant question released MediaPlayers i.e. those which got release from me do not count, right I.e. if I have 7 Media Players but 5 from those were already released, I use up only 752 AudioTracks from the global system pool. Is this correctp  pTherefore, if all applications correctly cared for releasing in their onStoponPause, then it is difficult to reach the hard limit mentioned above because only the foreground and possibly some paused apps use up AudioTracks  except for the OS, of course.p

Negative 1617 pI have written a program suppose X in c which creates a data structure and then uses it continuously. Now I would like to modify that data structure without aborting the previous program. I tried 2 ways to accomplish this task p  ol lipIn the same program X, first I created data structure and then tried to create a child process which starts accessing and using that data structure for some purpose. The parent process continues with its execution and asks the user for any modification like insertion, deletion, etc and takes input from console and subsequently modification is done. The problem here is, it doesnt modify the copy of data structure that the child process was using. Later on, I figured out this wont help because the child process is using its own copy of data structure and hence modifications done via parent process wont be reflected in it.  But definitely, I didnt want this to happen. So I went for multithreading. pli lipInstead of creating child process, I created an another thread which access that data structure and uses it and tried to take user input from console in different thread. Even,  this didnt work because of very fast switching between threads.pli ol  pSo, please help me to solve this issue. I want the modification to be reflected in the original data structure. Also I dont want the process which is accessing and using it continuously to wait for sometimes since its time crucial. p

Negative 1617 pWe have a complex app that serves AJAX JSON streams using ADO to grab the data using brief ASP servlets. Any given session can fire up from 1020 of these requests simultaneously. We encountered a significant performance problem way earlier than we expected as load built.

Research indicates that numbers of 2050 are not uncommon.

However if I used the  symbol, the value is recognized as text and using the above formula results in codeVALUEcode.

It uses the same code in codeindex.js.erbcode to return results from both calls, so Im not sure why one works and the other doesnt.p  pindex.html.erbp  precodelth1gtListing infolth1gt lt render partialsfilter gt OR lt render search gt  ltdiv idfiltertablegt   lt render list gt ltdivgt codepre  plist.html.erbp  precodelttable classtablesortergt lttheadgtlttrgtlttdgtNamelttdgtlttdgtIDlttdgtlttdgtDescriptionlttdgtlttrgtlttheadgt lttbodygt lt info.each do inf gt lttrgtlttdgtlt inf.name gtlttdgtlttdgtlt inf.id gtlttdgtlttdgtlt inf.desc gtlttdgtlttrgt lt end gt lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pindex.js.erbp  precodefiltertable.replaceWithltdiv idfiltertablegtlt escapejavascriptrender list gtltdivgt .tablesorter.tablesorterwidgets [zebra] codepre  pfilter.html.erbp  precodelt formtag, method gt get, remote gt true do gt   lt curid  params[id].toi gt   lt submittagFilter gt lt end gt codepre  psearch.html.erbp  precodelt formtag, method gt get, remote gt true do gt   Search for an ID lt textfieldtagid gt   lt submittagSearch gt lt end gt codepre  pcontroller.rbp  precodedef index   info  Blahblah   respondto do format     format.html     format.js   end end codepre  pHeres some example return from the AJAX callp  pWORKSp  precodehttphostnameblahutf8E29C93ampidStuffampcommitSearch  filtertable.replaceWithltdiv idfiltertablegtlttable classtablesortergtn  lttheadgtn  lttrgtn    ltth classsorter digitgtOneltthgtn    ltthgtIDltthgtn    ltthgtPersonltthgtn    ltthgtPersonltthgtn    ltthgtTwoltthgtn    ltthgtVIDltthgtn    ltthgttypeltthgtn    ltthgtStatusltthgtn    ltthgtThreeltthgtn    ltthgtFourltthgtn    ltthgtFiveltthgtn  lttrgtn  lttheadgtn  lttbodygtn  lttrgtn    lttdgtlta hrefblah801 id801gt801ltagtlttdgtn    lttdgtMeeplttdgtn    lttdgt1814lttdgtn    lttdgtMeep2lttdgtn    lttdgtTestlttdgtn    lttdgtStufflttdgtn    lttdgtunknownlttdgtn    lttdgtsubmittedlttdgtn    lttdgt47lttdgtn    lttdgt16.6lttdgtn    lttdgt7.9lttdgtn  lttrgtnlttbodygtnlttablegtnnnnltdivgt .tablesorter.tablesorterwidgets [zebra] codepre  pDOESNT WORKp  precodehttphostnameblahutf8E29C93ampfilter123ampcommitFilter  filtertable.replaceWithltdiv idfiltertablegtlttable classtablesortergtn  lttheadgtn  lttrgtn    ltth classsorter digitgtOneltthgtn    ltthgtIDltthgtn    ltthgtPersonltthgtn    ltthgtPersonltthgtn    ltthgtTwoltthgtn    ltthgtVIDltthgtn    ltthgttypeltthgtn    ltthgtStatusltthgtn    ltthgtThreeltthgtn    ltthgtFourltthgtn    ltthgtFiveltthgtn  lttrgtn  lttheadgtn  lttbodygtn  lttrgtn    lttdgtlta hrefblah801 id801gt801ltagtlttdgtn    lttdgtMeeplttdgtn    lttdgt1814lttdgtn    lttdgtMeep2lttdgtn    lttdgtTestlttdgtn    lttdgtStufflttdgtn    lttdgtunknownlttdgtn    lttdgtsubmittedlttdgtn    lttdgt47lttdgtn    lttdgt16.6lttdgtn    lttdgt7.9lttdgtn  lttrgtnlttbodygtnlttablegtnnnnltdivgt .tablesorter.tablesorterwidgets [zebra] codepre  pFirebug shows that the Ajax return from BOTH calls works fine, but somehow the codereplaceWithcode doesnt work for things that are returned from the Filter form, but does work for things that are returned from the Search form.

Negative 1617 pI am new to python done some java in the past. I recently decided to automate a process that takes me about 20 hours once a year.

This then loads the page with sizes of the item and price per size, I take this information and put it into a spreadsheet. The row has columns based on number of sizes and then price item,sm,med,lg,9.99,10.99,12.99.

Negative 1617 pI am developing an application that loads a web page using UIWebView using Storyboard I do know nothing about previous xib neither. I have already created a view controller for that UIWebView and everything works fine. The thing is since previous versions of iOS dont allow to upload files, I need to make a new view scene I thought it is called that allows the user to pick and post a picture. I am able to develop both views separately and they work as expected but now I need to connect them based on event triggered when user wants to post a picture to the server. Using shouldStartLoadWithRequest I can catch that action, then I need to redirect to new view which contains image picker and a button in order to upload the selected image if iOS version is below 6.0 but I am really lost when it comes to load the new controller to show that view. Using buttons it is trivial but I dont know how to called inside the code.

Negative 1617 pWe are experiencing some problems in our production environment, where we get an InvalidPropertyException from one of the compiled jsps which one differs from time to time after a bit of time.

Now we need to create a portable window client in simple .exe with window form gui that can talk with the web service in https without relying too much on other library or api. The client will send xml amp receive xml. Also it will read some text file in local pc and compress it and encode it as text format, like base64, then send it by restful way to server.p  pI know java might do this, but we wish not to rely on jvm.p  pI know .NET can do this, but it relies on .NET framework a lot. When we hope to support older OS like 2003, xp, even 2000, its a big issue to do compatibility check.p  pC is a choice, but not easy for us to develop or maintain.p  pCan other language, like python, php, ruby do this Without install additional program p  pCan we let user just download, unzip and runp  pThanks, any suggestions will be appreciated.p

Negative 1617 pAs title states Im planning to use events thats requirement of user actions made on items adddeleteupdate. Now here is some questions Im trying to answer and I have feeling someone already have stumbled on same problem setp  p1 strongObjects ID generation Server vs Client strong In case mobile client is offline  he needs to generate some ID for newly created object  so that subsequent actions on this object can have  some reference on it. What would be the best approach Generate some local ID and then assign global id generated on server once object is pushed to server. Our architectural team thinks  this is the right approach, but personally I dont see benefits of it. Especially in case user will logon on other mobile device and download all events  what Ids should he receive  Global or global  local. How this approach is better than just generating something similar to UUID time  hardwareid  userid  incrementingIdrandomId on the client sidep  p2 strongWhat is the propper way of dealing with several mobile  web clientsstrong user can be logged on single or several clients. First question here is strongconflicts resolutionstrong  here we have versions on our objects  to support optimistic locking  so the first who managed to do a commit is the winner. This seems to be clear. Other question is strongsynchronizationstrong. Ideally it would be nice to download to client only updated information. So that we will need to send to client events that are not known to him. For this obviously we need to have information  which event come from which device. This is one more point for having sourceId for each event sent to server. But how can we deal with 2 or more web sessions Im noob in regards to WEB programming, but we would like to be stateless, does it means that some scripts on browser should generate some sort of sessionID which will be used as sourceID for all events generated on web client and instantly sent to server p  pDoes anybody had similar tasks What solutions did you used  problems encounteredp

Negative 1617 pI have a Asp.Net web application running on Windows 2008 R2 IIS 7.5. I have two servers WWW1 and WWW2 and the DNS records are set up for round robin DNS for www. I increased the AppPool timeout and the Session State timeout settings so users dont get logged out after 20 minutes. However Ive noticed users are getting logged out randomly. I think what is happening is the user goes to www.foo.com and logs in and then afterward some time the round robin navigates them to the opposite server in the cluster WWW1 or WWW2 where the cookie was not created and therefore prompts them for a login.p  pHow can I get this to work and still keep my high availability solution using round robin DNS p

Negative 1617 pI have recently acquired source code from a VS2005 project that uses the MFC library. Firstly I upgraded the project to VS2012 and I can now successfully build and run the software on Windows 8. Next, I wanted to deploy the software on a Windows XP machine. p  pI have set the Platform Toolset to build to Windows XP using the v110xp option and I have installed the Visual C Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 1 on the target machine. When I run the software, nothing appears to happen. Via some logging functions I can determine that a call to LoadFrameIDRMAINFRAME causes an exception in kernel32.dll. I cant debug any further in to LoadFrame as remote debugging on Windows XP is not available in VS2012.p  pAny ideas what may be going wrong Is the Visual C Redistributable package the correct version to be installing on the target machine What should I be trying next p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pMy project is already set up to use the 7.1 SDK and has minimum required version set to 5.01 in linker options.p  pIf I use InstallShield to generate an installer and include the MFC, CRT and ATL redistributables, the installer works and my program now runs on Windows XP. My understanding of the redistributables is that they simply copy the relevant dlls in to the system32 folder or equivalent Is that correct p  pHowever, if I simply copy the files over, run the vsredistx86.exe or use Inno Setup to install the software amp dlls, my program no longer works.p

I assign the url node value to url and then create a new DOM object for the RSS feed using url.p  precodeurl  studentgtgetElementsByTagNameurl url  urlgtitem0gtnodeValue   rss  new DOMDocument rssgtloadurl codepre  pThe RSS file will not load when I use the code above. I even echoed url to make sure that it has a link assigned to it. However, if I put the actual url into the load, it works just fine. Why isnt url working in loadp

Negative 1617 pI recently made an app for Windows Phone 8, and now I want to be able to run it on older devices with WP7.x as well. Is this possible without having to make a whole new Visual Studio project targeting WP7 instead of WP8 I targeted WP8 to make sure I was not held back on available features, but I dont think I ended up using any features that are not available in WP7 anyway, so now I would like to extend with WP7.x compatibility. Any hints as to how this can be achieved as easily as possiblep

Negative 1617 pAs per suggestion at a job interview I had recently, I was advised to research into the uniqueptr functionality of C11, as a means of automated garbage collection. So Im using an older project and replacing my raw pointers to objects created with the new keyword, with uniqueptrs. However I think I have arrived at an issue of ownership.p  pIn my mainclass.cpp posted below please turn your attention to the init function and the 3 uniqueptrs to newinstantiated objects I have created. Named bg,bg2, and theGrid.  The commented out declarations below them are how they used to be done, and switching back to this method, the program runs just fine.p  pHowever, using the uniqueptrs, the line in the function void displayp  precodetheGridgtdoGridCalculationsMODEL codepre  pgenerates an access violation. This is also the first time in the sequence that any of the pointed objects are dereferenced, which leads me to believe that ownership of the uniqueptr is already lost somewhere. However, the uniqueptrs themselves are never passed into another function or container, and remain in the scope of the mainclass.cpp and therefore Ive seen no opportunity to use stdmovetheGrid in order to transfer ownership to where it needs to be.p  pMainclass.cppp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltGLglut.hgt  include ltmath.hgt include Block.h include dStructs.h include Grid.h include Texture.h include freetype.h include ltWindows.hgt    Declare a couple of textures  for the background  Texture bg Texture bg2 and theGrid Grid theGrid   Declare our font  freetypefontdata scoreFont  Initialize the variables  typedef dStructspoint point const int XSize  755, YSize  600   point offset  333,145 point mousePos  0,0   void initvoid      printfn......Hello Guy. n....nInitilising     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION         glLoadIdentity     gluOrtho2D0,XSize,0,YSize           initialise the fonts            try     scoreFont.initVisitor TT2 BRK Regular.ttf, 20      catch stdexception ampe          MessageBoxNULL, e.what, EXCEPTION CAUGHT, MBOK  MBICONINFORMATION                bg new MEMORY MANAGED EDITION          uniqueptrltTexturegt bgnew Texture1024,1024,BackGround.png     uniqueptrltTexturegt bg2new Texture1024,1024,BackGround2.png     uniqueptrltGridgt theGridnew Gridoffset           Old badmemorymanagement style of pointed objects          bg  new Texture1024,1024,BackGround.png     bg2  new Texture1024,1024,BackGround2.png     theGrid  new Gridoffset      glClearColor0,0.4,0.7,1      glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAactivate the alpha blending functionality     glEnableGLBLEND     glLineWidth2          Width of the drawing line     glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW      glDisableGLDEPTHTEST     printfnInitialisation Complete    void myPassiveMouseint x, int y      Stupid OGL coordinate system     y  YSize  y     mousePos.x  x     mousePos.y  y     printfnthe mouse coordinates are f,f,mousePos.x, mousePos.y   void displayGameplayHUD           SCORE          glColor4f0.7f,0.0f,0.0f,7.0fset the colour of the text     freetypeprintscoreFont, 100,400,SCORE      glColor4f1.0f,1.0f,1.0f,1.0fDefault texture colour.

Negative 1617 pI have coded a heightmap but it seems to lag the client. I just dont know how to increase the fps. I get about 36fps with the heightmap. Im using a quite large bmp for the heightmap, I think its 1024x1024. When i use a smaller on its fine, maybe im just not using the code effectively. Is there a better way to code this heightmap or did I just code it wrong. It is my first time I have worked on a heightmap.

Negative 1617 pSo in C I want to make functions that when declared, gets automatically added to a map or vector, doesnt really matter in this case as a function pointer and is called later automatically. For example this would be useful if I am writing unit test framework and I just want users to declare each of their unit tests like thisp  precodeUNITTESTFUNCTIONfunctionname   do something    codepre  pand instead something like this gets calledp  precodevoid functionname   do something  int temp  registerfunctionfunctionname, functionname  codepre  pWhere registerfunction adds the user defined function in a map of function pointers for example.  So basically, I need a mechanism that adds additional lines of code after a function definition, so that some action is performed automatically on the defined function.  Is this possible using macros perhaps p

Negative 1617 pImagine this scenariop  pWe have a massive repository, with many different features branches. Each of the feature branches uses one large sprite image. This large sprite image might be slightly different in each feature branch. Feature branches might be merged into different release candidate branches, and then back into master, at different points.p  pGit cannot version this image eg, merge changes to the image, and so we are struggling to find an approach to manage this. p  pOne approach is to always keep a master PSD of the sprite image. Whenever a new image is needed to be added to the sprite, a developer would first update the PSD master document, then export the new sprite image. This will ensure the sprite image will always contain all changes. But obviously this sprite image will contain changes we might not want in the different branches eg, a change to an image within the sprite.p  pEssentially we need to be able to version this sprite image. Git is not the tool to help us with this, but we need the image to be versioned with the code. p  pHow does one generally manage versioning of images in a git respositoryp
Negative 1617 pIm developing a network based iOS app that downloads json data from the server and processes it. Both the downloading task and processing task can take a significant time to complete, So I dont want to perform either on the main thread.p  pI think there are 2 ways to do thisp  ol lipPerform asynchronous loading using codeNSURLConnectioncode and in the codedidFinishLoadingcode method use strongGCDstrong say to do the processing in background.pli lipUse strongGCDsstrong codedispatchasynccode say to start work in background and use codeNSURLConnectionscode codesendSynchronousRequestreturningResponseerrorcode to download the data synchronously, Do the processing of the data, And call codeUIcode updates on the main thread.pli ol  pI think the 2nd method would be easier to write and would produce cleaner code, Especially if one downloadprocess data task involves multiple sequential service calls for data download.

Negative 1617 pI am working on a platformer for iOS and was looking for the best way to incorporate the physics. The physics need only be very basic. But most of all for detection of the collision between the enemies and player, and realistic running speeding up and slowing down gradually rather than on specific speed.p  pI started the project with Cocos2D for ease of incorporating graphics, and then adding effects later.p  pI know that Cocos2D comes included with Box2D and Chipmunk, but Ive also seen that Cocos2D has basic collision to begin with. I plan on working with sprite sheets but may have the need to falling objects at some point.p  pAll in all, I would just like some opinion on the matter. Should I or should I not add Box2DChipmunk to work the physics for me.

Negative 1617 pI am trying to build an api using django which should alter iptables using POST parameters. I am using django 1.4, a hrefhttpdjangorestframework.org relnofollowdjangorestframeworka, a hrefhttpsgithub.comldxpythoniptables relnofollowpythoniptablesa. The problem I am facing is that pythoniptables need root access to change iptables rules. I can change the iptables rules by doing code sudo pythoncode and from the python shell I can change those rules. Also I can change those rules by using a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypiiptdump relnofollowiptdumpa module which takes in iptables parameters and create those rules which I can later save in a file iptables.rules.txt and use fabrics codelocalsudo iptablesrestore lt iptables.rules.txtcode. But this will always prompt the user for a root password. Is there a way I can give django app root privileges so that I can bypass sudo password prompt.p

Negative 1617 pI am working on a Google apps script that uses html service.

Nothing appeared this time either  though the example code returns the the picker to the doGet function  which returns it as well. My doGet returns the html since I am using html service.p  pI just want anyway to integrate a simple doc picker into my app. Sample code that I can cut and paste and then modify would be really helpful since I can probably figure it out from there.p  pThanks.p  hr  pIt may help to explain what I am trying to do since someone may have a different approach suggestion.p  pI am a teacher at a school and an amature programmer. We use google sites and google drive at our school. I want to create an app on an internal site page that teachers can use to copy and share a template file with a whole class automatically.p  pThe only way I know how to do this is to create a google apps script that uses html service. I can then combine html and javascript to create an easy to use form to get the information from the teacher. I know how to have the script get the file, copy it, add viewer or editors, etc.p  pRight now that only way I know how to have the teacher identify their file is to enter the file id. Many of the teachers at my school are not overly profiicient with computers, and I would like to make this part simpler, since explaining how to identiy and copy the id from the web address is not so easy.p  pI saw a few references to the google doc picker and this seemed liked a nice way to do it if there was some way to make it work with what I need or some other easy way to accomplish what I need.p  pAny helpful suggestions would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1617 pIm experiencing a strange situation with examining my query in MySQL using the explain command. Ive got a table, which has three nonunique single column index on columns Period,X, and Y. All three of these columns have the same integer datatype. Then I examine the following commandsp  precodeEXPLAIN SELECT  FROM MyTable WHERE Period  201208 AND X gt 0 AND Y lt 454 EXPLAIN SELECT  FROM MyTable WHERE Period  201304 AND X gt 0 AND Y lt 454 codepre  pThe first one shows Using index condition Using where, but stangely the second onnly shows Using where, so it seems like changing one parameter somehow eliminates indexes in query execution.p  pThe table has about 65000 total rows, about 5000 per Period value so its balanced, and the first query returns about 2000 number of rows, the second returns about 500. Also, the latter period value 201304 is not the last physically in the table, and the former value is not the first as well, there are many rows with period values less and greater than this two specific.p  pMy original table is quite complex with lots of columns, so I cannot paste it into here. But the only indexes are this three, and the query is the same as I used during testing, so I hope it should not matter too much.p  pCould someone give me any tip what can cause this and if I need to take care of something what I dont know about Thank you.p

If you would like information on how I did this feel free to email me.p  hr  pI have recently moved my project to maven.

However, when I run the procedure again, the following appears in my repop  precode1.0.0SNAPSHOT 1.0.1SNAPSHOT 1.0.0 1.0.2SNAPSHOT codepre  pThat is, release 1.0.1 is never created, and instead 1.0.1SNAPSHOT is released to 1.0.0. Note that every other aspect runs as expected  the codepom.xmlcode now points to code1.0.2SNAPSHOTcode and a tag is created in my SCM with the name codemyproject1.0.1code.p  pIn fact, every time I run the release procedure, the SNAPSHOT increases but the release is written to 1.0.0 with a new release never created. For example, rerunning the release procedure 3 further times results in the following p  precode1.0.0SNAPSHOT 1.0.1SNAPSHOT 1.0.2SNAPSHOT 1.0.3SNAPSHOT 1.0.4SNAPSHOT 1.0.0 1.0.5SNAPSHOT codepre  pThe expected behaviour for the above isp  precode1.0.0SNAPSHOT 1.0.0 1.0.1SNAPSHOT 1.0.1 1.0.2SNAPSHOT 1.0.2 1.0.3SNAPSHOT 1.0.3 1.0.4SNAPSHOT 1.0.4 1.0.5SNAPSHOT codepre  pThe codepom.xmlcode for the very first version is shown belowp  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 x mlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgmavenv400.xsdgt  ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt ltgroupIdgtcom.fooltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtmyprojectltartifactIdgt ltpackaginggtjarltpackaginggt ltversiongt1.0.0SNAPSHOTltversiongt ltnamegtmyprojectltnamegt  ltdistributionManagementgt     ltrepositorygt         ltidgtmyserverltidgt         lturlgtfilemyserverrepolturlgt     ltrepositorygt ltdistributionManagementgt  ltscmgt     ltdeveloperConnectiongtscmsvnhttpsmyserversvnmyprojectltdeveloperConnectiongt ltscmgt  ltbuildgt     ltpluginsgt          ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavenreleasepluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.4.1ltversiongt         ltplugingt             ltpluginsgt   ltbuildgt  ltrepositoriesgt     ltrepositorygt         ltidgtmyserverltidgt         lturlgtfilemyserverrepolturlgt     ltrepositorygt ltrepositoriesgt  ltprojectgt codepre  pOne of the answers below suggests I should create a separate codereleasecode and codesnapshotcode repo, which I have not.

Similarly, the checkout for tag code1.0.2code contains the tags code1.0.0code and code1.0.1code, etc. Is this correct behaviourp  pPerhaps the release process is always looking in the tags folder of whatever it checks out and uses the first one it finds, which will always be code1.0.0code for every releases emexceptem the first release.p  pThis seems like a very strange explanation but it is the only one I have so far for the behaviour I see. The question now is, what have I configured in my codepom.xmlcode incorrectly to cause this to happenp  pAnother note when performing the release the deploy goal complains that codebuild.plugins.plugin.version for org.apache.maven.pluginsmavenxxxxplugin is missing.code for codemavenjavadocplugincode, codemavendeployplugincode and codemavensourceplugincode.

Negative 1617 pI am currently implementing my own simple toy programming language. I would like this to be implemented as quickly as possible, but I am quite unsure where to go from the current stage I am in.

Does anyone have any idea on how I should tackle this Or should I not interpret an AST, and just compile to an IR and interpret the IR. p  pIf that case is the latter, instead of inventing my own IR, what possible IRs and VMs to interpret the IR are there free to use without any limitations in my source code I know of LLVM, but are there any others that I should possibly considerp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe programming language that I am creating is a simple Clike language and has some visual basic traits thrown in there.

Negative 1617 pI need an opinion about how to structure my models for a rails 4 app Im doodling on. The architecture shouldnt be too hard but Ive been going in circles for hours so Ill throw it out to the community. p  pI have a model called checkin that hasmany fields. Each field can have many values that can be one of several data types that may increase in number over time but for starters will be just codefloatcode and codestringcode. Once a field is added to a checkin its data type cannot change. p  pThink of a checkin for losing weight where some people would want to log just codeweightcode. Others might want to log codeweightcode, codebodyfatcode. Others might want extra fields for other metrics or a text field for what mood youre in.p  pSo what Ive got so far isp  precodeclass Checkin lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany fields  class Field lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto checkin codepre  pAnd then I was going to do p  precodeclass DataFloat lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto field  class DataString lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto string codepre  petc. p  pThe schema is simple with just references for now. DataFloat has a float and DataString has a string as youd expectp  pThen Ill use something like codeActiveRecordBase.descendantscode a as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions516579isthereawaytogetacollectionofallthemodelsinyourrailsappTHISa to create a select box so that you can choose what a field is when you add it to the checkin.p  pMy question for all those MVC experts out there is whether or not this is the best way to do this. Would I be better off having a central object Data that is extended by DataFloat and DataString Is there a third, better way I havent thought ofp

Negative 1617 pIm very new to SQL and relational databases just started learning last week and Im in the process of upgrading my website and currently keep all my data in XML files.  It works, but the new site would be better suited from what I hear a relational database can do, and it looks like SQLite is best for me.  One of my concerns is concurrency, even though 99 of the data will be readonly which I understand SQLite is pretty good at 99 of the time.  Other things, like page view counters for certain pages will constantly require small writes.  Im still learning database design and want to do it right.  Would it make sense to make separate databases for things that get written to a lot, that way making the main database far less susceptible to concurrency issues  Is it possible to do a foreign key type reference I still havent used foreign keys yet, but think I understand them across databases  As each view count would point to some primary key in the main database.

Negative 1617 pI have a client who processes payments through the PayPal PayFlow Pro gateway.p  pMost of the transactions come in via the website, and we log the transactions and provide reporting in the sites admin tools.p  pHowever, the client sometimes logs directly into the virtual terminal to add manual transactions and issue refunds. So the transaction log on the site does not necessarily reflect the actual state of transactions sent through the gateway.p  pAdditionally, there are several product categories which the client would like to perform reporting onand because the sites transaction log is inaccurate, they want to do this reporting in the virtual terminal.p  pThe solution for this was to create a separate account per category and send the transactions per category to its appropriate account.p  pMy coworkers lessthanideal implementation was to disallow them from adding items from more than one category to the cart at one time. The user was instructed to do two separate checkouts.p  pThis was barely tolerable when there were only two categories, but now there will be three.p  pThe clients proposed solution is to start allowing them to mix categories in the cart, but on the back end, split them out and send separate transactions per category inline during checkout.p  pAs you can probably guess, I am not a fan of doing it this way. Im worried about the possibility of something going wrong halfway through the process and leaving the checkout in a half finished state. Plus, it sounds like an accounting nightmare.p  pI was hoping that PayFlow Pro would provide some sort of line item functionality and provide the appropriate reporting capabiilties.p  pTheir XML API seems to support line items, and Im assuming this is for Level III transactions. However, when I log into the virtual terminal, there doesnt seem to be any support for Level III data. Plus, I get the feeling this isnt Level III is meant for, and that Im going against the grain.p  pSo Im weighing my options here, and these are the two Ive considered so farp  ul lipProvide functionality to create adhoc transactions, issue refunds, etc. in our web app, and make a rule that they can only make these changes through the web app. That way we can log these transactions and provide more accurate reporting on our end. However, this will be a ton of work.pli lipPerhaps theres something else in the PayPal universe that provides a richer API and reporting capabilities on the backend. It would need to be able to support their existing merchant account. If their fees went up it would be a reasonable tradeoff for getting what they want.pli ul  pGenerally, asking if anyone understands PayPal well enough to tell me if option B exists, because PayPals product offerings are very confusing to me. Additionally, if anyone has any general advice, or if theres an option C I havent considered.p  pThanks.p
Negative 1617 pI am integrating my app with facebook so users can post to their timeline. I had this working previously and I have double checked the app dashboard and compared this to my key hash and app id that i am using and still the user cannot post.

I get toast pop up with an error code when the user is using the app that says to contact facebook. The error code is 1732910. I have tried using the keytool from both java 1.6 and 1.7 as well redownloading the openssl as this worked from some users. However, my key hash remains the same.

Negative 1617 pIn PowerShell, I believe Im observing that PowerShell is attempting to delete folders before their contents are deleted. The command Im using is codeRemoveItemcode.p  pIn the past, using it with coderecursecode would sporadically error out complaining about the directory not being empty. When I saw that error, I would find the target directory empty when I went to check. My best guess is that it was moving on while files were still in the process of being deleted. Now Im seeing more evidence of that.p  pBecause of the above, I was trying to use the following snippetp  precodetoDelete  GetChildItem path Recurse [Array]ReversetoDelete toDelete  RemoveItem RemoveItem path codepre  pWhat Im getting now is the following promptp  precodeConfirm The item at [path to directory] has children and the Recurse parameter was not specified.

My best guess is that codetoDelete  RemoveItemcode is returning before the files are actually deleted and that Im seeing this prompt on codeRemoveItem pathcode.p  pIs this a known issue Are my suspicions about whats happening wrong How can I work around itp  pI tried using codecmd C rd S [path to directory]code, but this was problematic because I found exit code was code0code when it failed to delete some children that were in use.

Negative 1617 pI am trying to make a simple android application, in order to make http requests between 2 android devices. The principle is the followingp  pThe two android devices are running the same application. One device will make a http request to the other android device which will listen on a specified port, and the latter will respond to the first one with a response message like OK, Not received etc. Basically, I have a form with name, firstname, address etc. and I want to send these with Http Request, and have a response  to this request for acknowledging. I googled around for a couple of hours, all I could find were some examples with HttpRequest, but these were used when we want to make a HttpRequest to a website. Is there any way to do thisp

Consider the followingp  precodeSite group 1           Site group 2     site1.com               site3.com     site2.com               site4.com codepre  pIf an admin on site1.com tries to add content, they will see only site1.com and site2.com as options, whereas an admin on site4.com will only see site3.com and site4.com.p  pThese options will be embedded in various forms across the CMS, and in order to display only the correct sites, I can do the following from within the e.g. NewsPostTypep  precodesiteGroup  siteManagergtgetSiteGroup  buildergtaddsites, entity, array     class         gt MyBundleSite,     multiple      gt true,     expanded      gt true,     property      gt name,     querybuilder gt functionEntityRepository er use siteGroup          qb  ergtcreateQueryBuilders         return qbgtandWheres.siteGroup  siteGroup             gtsetParametersiteGroup, siteGroup     ,  codepre  pThis correctly displays only those sites which belong to the current site group.p  pHowever, in order to do this, I have to define each FormType that I want to include these options in as a service in order to inject the siteManager object, so to avoid this, I thought about creating a new FormType which could have the manager injected into it and be included as followsp  precodebuildergtaddsites, siteGroupSites codepre  pThe siteGroupSites type is defined as followsp  precodeltphp  class SiteGroupSitesType extends AbstractType      private siteManager      public function constructsiteManager          thisgtsiteManager  siteManager           public function buildFormFormBuilder builder, array options          currentSite  thisgtsiteManagergtgetCurrentSite         siteGroup    currentSite  currentSitegtgetSiteGroup  null          buildergtaddsites, entity, array             class         gt MyBundleSite,             multiple      gt true,             expanded      gt true,             property      gt name,             querybuilder gt functionEntityRepository er use siteGroup                  qb  ergtcreateQueryBuilders                 return qbgtandWheres.siteGroup  siteGroup                     gtsetParametersiteGroup, siteGroup             ,                    public function getDefaultOptionsarray options          return array             dataclass gt MeMyBundleEntitySite,                codepre  pIf I try to include the site options as above, I get the followingp  precodeExpected argument of type MeMyBundleEntitySite,  DoctrineCommonCollectionsArrayCollection given codepre  pI think I might need a DataTransformer of some description, but am unsure how to tackle this. I would also like to display the options list in twig by just using p  precode formrowform.sites  codepre  pInstead of what I think would be required since form.sites is the embedded form, and form.sites.sites would be the sites property of the embedded formp  precode formrowform.sites.sites  codepre  pCan anyone point me in the right direction as to how to accomplish thesep

Negative 1617 pOk, as far as I understand, trycatch blocks try an operation and catch blocks catch exceptions. The more specific exceptions go up top, the more generic towards the bottom of the series of catch blocks. In the following code, I implement trycatch, everything works fine. p  pAs far as I understand, a finally block always executes. Some people have argued that there is no purpose to finally block, because if there is an exception or there isnt, the code after the last catch block gets executed anyways. p  pHowever, the argument against this is that if there is an exception thrown emin a catch blockem, there are no subsequent catch blocks to catch that exception. So by putting resource cleanup code in a finally block, you ensure that resources will be released in the event that an exception is thrown in a catch block. p  pWhich is why the following code puzzles me. I throw an exception in the first catch block and the finally block never executes.

Negative 1617 pIn my XCode project, I want some default setup settings, which basically is a set of variables like GlobalTintColor, ServerUrl and so forth.

Negative 1617 pI am creating Christofides algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem. In part of the algorithm I need to find nodes of a graph that are of odd degree and then calculate the lowest weight. This can be done by the Blossom algorithm, but I am choosing to do it a different way by finding the sum of the possible combinations that you have from a 2D array because I am struggling with the blossom algorithm and do not understand it.p  pI have 2D array which stores the weights between vertices of odd degree in a graph. For examplep  precodearray  array                    0gt array0, 2, 20,4,                    1gt array2,0,7,8,                    2gt array20,2,0,12,                    3gt array4,8,12,0                     codepre  pso between 0 and 1 is of weight 2, if i select  the vertices 0 and 1, I am then left with the weight between vertex 2 and 3 because vertex 0 and 1 has already been used. I then need to sum the weights of array[0][1] and array[2][3].p  pI am struggling with creating an algorithm that returns the combination of possible vertex pairs. For example in the array above the possible pairs are [0,12,3],[0,21,3],[0,31,2]p  p0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3 cannot be used as there is no edge weight between them. Also, the reverse of them is not needed[1,02,3].p  pWith these pairs I can then calculate the sum of the weights and choose the smallest.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1617 pDo C compilers differ in the way they treat 2D arrays in C not C I am doing image processing in C, and it seems to me that dealing with 2D arrays is the most intuitive way, as opposed to a 1D array. p  pIve also developed some algorithms on my Windows machine to process images by denoising or smoothing. The question I have is should I be worried about carrying these algorithms to another C compiler if I am using a 2D array to store images and filters Will things hit the fan if one uses 2D arrays in C in the long run  So the essence of this question is how safe are 2D arrays in Cp  pThanks.p

Negative 1617 pWe would like to evaluate the effectiveness of our indexes in a MongoDBbased REST service setup. The idea is to populate a collection with a synthetic dataset e.g. 10,000,000 documents then run a load injector process doing random REST operations each one involving a query at MongoDB layer to evaluate which indexes are being used and statistical information about them e.g. per index hit rate.p  pWe have considered using a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencemethodcursor.explaincursor.explain relnofollowexplaina command or a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencecommandindexStats relnofollowindexStatsa.

Negative 1617 pI am very new to this site and a novice programmer so Im hoping someone here can help me with the problem Im facing. I am making a simple program that uses a card layout to selectenter several userspecific options that will be stored in string variables and then after the last question, used to give a unique answer. Right now the program advances slides successfully and displays the proper question, however it does not clear the JRadioButton from the first card and keeps using this radio button instead of the desired component for the duration of the program. For example, The second and third card should have JTextFields while the 4th card should have a JComboBox.

Negative 1617 pI am using Visual Studio 2013, Express version. I need to create a windows application that will allow users to generate reports. So I downloaded the ReportViewer 2012 RT and successfully added the ReportViewer dll to VS. So now I have a ReportViewer component in my toolbox I can add to a form.p  pHaving never used ReportViewer before, Im not sure where to go from here. I did find this page about how to add printable reports  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms233804.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms233804.aspxap  pThe thing is, it gives these steps  1 Drag a ReportViewer control from the Data tab of the Toolbox onto your form. 2 On the Project menu, choose Add New Item. In the Add New Item dialog box, select the Report icon and click Add. 3 The Report Designer opens in the development environment, and a report .rdlc file is added to the project.p  pAfter completing step 1 I do not see Report in the list of items I can add. I do not see any other Report components listed in the toolbox, either.p  pDoes anyone know what I am missingp  pI did a lot of searching found discussions about getting the ReportViewer in the first place that then stop there, or about using Report Builder.  Based on my understanding of Report Builder, though, that is a SQL Server component and is for use in reporting on SQL server data...the reports in my application are to be based on local data internal arrays, not SQL related at all.  So I should just need the ReportViewer, rightp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 1617 pWhen opening my app, a table view is the first thing that appears. In codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode, Im using GCD to asynchronously load images into the table view they are not fetched from the web, but are stored locally in a model. Although this works, there is a short glitch when the table view shows up for the first time. As you can guess, this is because the images are loaded a split second after the table view has appeared on screen.p  pI would like to get rid of this, so I was wondering if there was a way to test whether the images have been loaded before presenting the table view.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp  pstrongClarificationstrong Im using GCD in order to have buttersmooth scrolling. This works great, so I would like to keep everything pretty much exactly the way it is. I would just like to get rid of the glitch on launch.p

Negative 1617 pI use Spring Data JPA and EclipseLink 2.5.2 as my JPA provider. The database I use is PostgreSQL. I have a table that has an auto increment serial ID as the followingp  precodeCREATE TABLE segment    caseid character varying32,   segmentid serial NOT NULL,   segstarttime timestamp without time zone,   segendtime timestamp without time zone,   CONSTRAINT segmentpkey PRIMARY KEY segmentid  codepre  pIn the Java data class codeSegmentcode, I defined it asp  precodeEntity Tablenamesegment public class Segment      Id     GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.SEQUENCE, generatorsegmentsegmentidseq     SequenceGeneratornamesegmentsegmentidseq, sequenceNamesegmentsegmentidseq, allocationSize1     private Integer segmentID     private String caseID     private Timestamp segStartTime     private Timestamp segEndTime  codepre  pThen I have the following Spring Data JPA code to test insert into function to the databasep  precode    Segment seg2  new Segment     seg2.setCaseID000014     seg2.setSegStartTimeTimestamp.valueOf20140801 103639     seg2.setSegEndTimeTimestamp.valueOf20140802 142208     seg2  repository.saveseg2      Segment seg3  repository.findOneseg2.getSegmentID codepre  pWhen I run the above test code, something strange happens. The above code should only insert one record to the table and the serial ID codesegmentidcode should only increment by 1 after calling the above code. However, I found that the auto increment segmentid incremented by 2 after this codesavecode is called. But if I directly type the SQL query in PostgreSQL command linep  precodeINSERT INTO segment caseid, segstarttime, segendtime VALUES 000014, 20140801 103639, 20140802 142208  codepre  pIt works properly and the auto increment serial ID codesegmentidcode only incremented by 1 after insertion. Im really puzzled by this behavior. Then I changed my JPA provider from EclipseLink 2.5.2 to Hibernate 4.3.6 and tried running the above Java code again. It works normally and the codesegmentidcode also gets incremented by 1 after calling codesavecode method of codeCrudRepositorycode class.p  pSo is this a possible bug of EclipseLink JPA Or is it due to some bugs in Spring Data JPA integration with EclipseLink p

Negative 1617 pIn my c windows form application I have a webBrowser and a lot of buttons and 2 timers and other stuff.

I want to give my form someway of knowing what time it is and execute the corresponding college class button for that time of day. So for example if I start my form on Monday at 9am it logs me in it executes the button1.PerformClick , which takes me to OHS and say if I start my form on Tuesday at say 1pm it logs me in and clicks button2.PerformClick, which takes me to a different subject and so on. My form clock works perfect and my login works perfect, and my buttons that go to my college classes work but now I want to automate it.

You can return null if the fragment does not          provide a UI.           We create the UI with a scrollview and text and return a reference to          the scoller which is then drawn to the screen          Override         public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                 Bundle savedInstanceState               Toast.makeTextgetActivity, DetailsFragmentonCreateView,                     Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                           if container  null                We have different layouts, and in one of them this               fragments containing frame doesnt exist. The fragment               may still be created from its saved state, but there is               no reason to try to create its view hierarchy because it               wont be displayed. Note this is not needed  we could               just run the code below, where we would create and return               the view hierarchy it would just never be used.              return null                             If nonnull, this is the parent view that the fragments UI              should be attached to. The fragment should not add the view              itself, but this can be used to generate the LayoutParams of              the view.                            programmatically create a scrollview and texview for the text in              the containerfragment layout.

Negative 1617 pIm looking to use spark for some ETL, which will mostly consist of update statements a column is a set, thatll be appended to, so a simple insert is likely not going to work.

Negative 1617 pI need to make small downloads initiated when my app is in the background and woken up by Significant Location Changes.

Doing so lets the system schedule those   transfers at times that are more optimal for the device. strongFor example,   the system might delay transferring large files until the device is   plugged in and connected to the network via WiFi.strong The default value   of this property is NO.p      pThe session object applies the value of this property only to   transfers that your app starts while it is in the foreground. strongFor   transfers started while your app is in the background, the system   always starts transfers at its discretionstrongin other words, the system   assumes this property is YES and ignores any value you specified.p blockquote  pThis seems to imply that if a download is started in the background the OS always has discretion as to whether and when to proceed with the download. It seems that the OS is always waiting for a wifi connection before completing these tasks. My experience supports this conjecture. I find that I can send several notifications for downloads while device is on cellular. They remain stuck. When I switch the device to wifi they all go through.p  pWTF Why Apple prohibits configuring this behaviour, especially since they HAVE the neccessary properties on the NSURLSessionConfiguration object discretionary, allowsCellularAccess. Of course the user is not always in WiFi when download tasks are started. I need to do this in response of app wakeups by significant location changes. I schedule download tasks on a background session and never receive delegate callbacks on cellular network until I switch to WiFi. So does that mean I cannot finish these tasks unil WiFi is available again or I bring the app back to foreground p  pHas anybody of you a workaround for thisp  pI already thought of the followingp  pStarting a long running background task old style after a location update and download my stuff there by using a defaultSessionConfiguration. Any experiences if that can work If this doesnt I will use NSURLConnection I think even more old style.p

Negative 1617 pAlso, attack works, however, the main issue is that Im supposed to make weapon attack IN ONE DIRECTION.p  pHi, I am making a turn based action game where the player can either move or attack enemies,  using a certain weapon. Enemies just use a simple attack logic of checking if the player is nearby, then making him take damage if so. Nearby uses Math.Abs to find absolute distance away.p  pHere is the old Nearby method used for Enemy attackp  precodepublic bool NearbyPoint locationToCheck, int distance                      if Math.Abslocation.X  locationToCheck.X lt distance ampamp             Math.Abslocation.Y  locationToCheck.Y lt distance                              return true                          else                              return false                       codepre  pSo the Enemy class, which contains the above method, passes Player location into the method, and its own attack range as an int, then checks it against its own location, and damages the  player if return true.p  pHowever, the player attack is more complicated. His weapon must check for Nearby distance in a given direction first. So I need to write a new overloaded Nearby method to work with the Players Weapon attack logic. I dont know how to do this. Somehow, the Players Weapon Attack method is supposed to pass parameters into the following DamageEnemy methodp  precodeprotected bool DamageEnemyDirection direction, int radius, int damage, Random random   Point target  game.PlayerLocation     for int distance  0 distance lt radius distance          foreach Enemy enemy in game.Enemies              if Nearbyenemy.Location, target, distance                  enemy.Hitdamage, random                 return true                               target  Movedirection, target, game.Boundaries                          return false  codepre  pThis DamageEnemy method relies on two new overloaded methods, the aforementioned Move method, and the overloaded Nearby method. emI am doing this as a tutorial in Oreilly Headfirst C, p. 480, by the way.emp  pThe original inherited Move method is simple it just updates the location field of the object that inherits it in a direction based on the input of one of 4 directions from a Direction Enum.p  pI want to do this myself, but really cant figure out how the attack logic is supposed to work Can anyone give me some hints to point me in the right direction I dont know what they want me to make the new Move overloaded method for. Is the player supposed to jump to the point where he attacks Or does it have some other functionality Thanksp

However, my project has multiple servletmappings and each one has specific Spring settings to them.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong Which contextConfigLocation is going to be loaded first by Spring Will it be the generalApplicationContext.xml or will it be the specificApplicationContext.xml More importantly, does the order of loading even matter From my debugging efforts, it seems apparent that it does because I get different errors when I move some independent Spring configuration from one file to the other.p  pemNBem Whether or not using multiple spring configurations for multiple servlet mappings is a good practice is debatable. Same goes for using XML config instead of the new Java config. But thats not what Im trying to ask here. Lets try to focus on my main question.p

Negative 1617 pIm designing an Android application that would rely heavily on natural language processing for its purposes. I selected OpenNLP since it seems to offer what I need to offer, made a few classes to encapsulate tokenization, pos tagging, etc, and tested them out in a standard java setting with no issues.p  pMy problem seems to be with the Android File system.

Negative 1617 pI have a code first entity framework project with an entity Staff which has a number of selfreferential navigation properties of type Staff.p  pIn the database schema I can see that there is a column created named StaffId which is not the primary key for the table and in all current records is always null.p  pI cannot figure out what this column is actually being used for and as it seems to be unused Id like to remove it. However I cannot find any means of identifying why entity framework is generating this column in the first place.p  pDoes anyone know how I can track down which property in my model is causing entity framework to generate this columnp

Negative 1617 pI have a situation where Im having to use a blackboxed wrapper for multithreading which I suspect sits on top of a TBB Thread Pool.p  pI have a value that can only be obtained by an object that has an expensive constructor, and each thread needs a local instance of that, which is OK. That object will produce a value that is guaranteed always identical across threads all constructors take the same const forming argument from the main loop. Each thread also has access to a shared struct for that argument as well as to save some results.p  pThe value in question an iteration range in the form of unsigned int required by the threads is used later in the main loop, so if I could Id rather not create another expensive instance of the above mentioned object just to get that same value again.p  pMy question is, on Windows with VC11, and Linux with GCC 4.8.2, on x8664, is writing the same value to the same memory location int in a struct the threads have a pointer to from multiple threads a benign race Is it a race I could just let happen without guarding the value with an expensive lock From cursory testing it seems to be the case, but Im not entirely sure whether under the hood the operation is atomic and safe, or if theres a potential for corruption that might show up under stress.p

How can we build that structure If I am not clear enough, I can give detailed info to your questions.p  pThanks,p  pstrongEditstrong I have an intuition that the case is not so clear. Let me give a simple scenariop  pAssume that I have a schema user with objects named DUMMY which has a table named DummyTbl and a function named DummyFunc. Obviously the user DUMMY can manage all of those objects in an unlimited way, since she is the owner. However, I do not want developers to use the generic user DUMMY and I want them to logon the database with their own username. p  pBecause, I cannot differentiate the privilige level of developers when I gave them the user DUMMYs password. All of the developers can behave unlimitedly. In contrary, I want the senior developer named DummySenior to be able to create,alter,execute objects and also do CRUD operations on DummyTbl. p  pBut, I want the junior developer named DummyJunior only to reference the objects and not carry out CRUD operations on tables. The most obvious way of achieving this is to accompany roles. However, we have several issues with configuring the required roles ie. afaik for DummySenior to be able to create a table under DUMMY schema, he must have create any table privilige. p  pHowever, when DummySenior has that privilige, he can create table under DUMMY2 schema too. That is an obvious security breach.p

A use case example could be you want the individual page content containers to be able to configure whether or not a hamburger menu is available on the page, like codepagecontent showmenufalsecode. This way you can simply define the menu at the top level and let children configure it as they need for their content. p  pIm coming from the angular world, but it seems the more preferred way to handle this kind of thing in Ember is to bind to controller properties or handle actions in routescontroller actions at any appropriate level in the action bubbling. I cant help but feel that in many cases the controllers and routes have no business worrying about UI configurations, and so the related UI components should be able to simply communicate with each other and leave the controllers out of it.p  pAnother pattern Ive actually seen in codeemberclicode addons has been for children components to lookup and register themselves with a specific parent. And then the parent will call the interfaces of the children, or manipulate them however they see fit. Basically the same concept as above, just the opposite.p

I.e. if I attach 3 color buffers to camera, call codeCamera.Rendercode color buffer with index 0 will contain rendered scene, and all the other buffers will remain untouched unless some shader specifically write in them. My shader utilizes that behavior I use buffers with indexes 1 and 2 to accumulate data needed for post process effect.p  pHowever, in OpenGL mode standard unity3d shaders write in ALL color buffers at once. I.e. if I attach multiple render buffers to a camera, call codeCamera.Rendercode all 3 buffers will contain copy of rendered scene. p  pThat breaks my shader in OpenGL mode. p  pHow can I fix that I need to render the whole scene in one go, and only objects that have specific shader should modify additional color buffers. p  pI need to render scene in one go because using layer masks causes unity to recalculate projector shadows for ALL lights and I need shadows to be correct.p  pAdvicep
Negative 1617 pI want my sprite a 2d top down fighter plane to always move to the spritesa right. I currently have it so the plane rotates to where the mouse pointer is.  Now I need the plane to always be moving and so you can rotate it with your mouse while the plane is flying. A short code example would be excellent as I am not very experienced.  The sprite is plane.png. I am using Python 2.7 if that matters.  Thanksp

However, some people mentionned in the commentaries e. g. nivcaner and lior that this solution is not good. Where do we stand Can I safely use itp  pIm working on a web application where an user can create a document in his browser where tables, headers and videos can be added via JQuery. When the user saves his document, its structure is translated into an array, where all elements of the array consist of pure text, with no tags e.g. there is one array element for each table cell which contains the text of that cell, etc.. Then the array is converted into JSON format and is sent to the server and is processed  sanitized  saved in JSON format via PHP.p  pAfter that, the document can be accessed by other users, and this of course introduces potential security holes. The idea is that they read the JSON data from the server and then recreate the document via javascriptJQuery on the client side.p  pWhile Im pretty confident that my PHP code does its job of properly sanitizing the JSON data, Im afraid of some attack where a malicious user could trick other users into reading JSON data from an untrusted source. For this reason, I have the feeling that its better to also validate any JSON data coming from the server before recreating tables, etc. on the client side. Assuming that the variable codecurrentCellTextcode holds the JSON read text to be written in the table cell codemytdcode, can I safely use the code codemytd.textcurrentCellTextcode to recreate the cell contentsp

Negative 1617 pThe case is the project now want to simplify the response in JSON. However, the backend service need to provide the original JSON response as well as the new simplified JSON response.

Negative 1617 pI have a method that sends an email at a specific time using the EJB Schedule annotation. It was working completely fine before and was working for the last few weeks, and was sending the emails at the designated time. However today, it has stopped working and I havent changed any of the code in that method. I did however, do some JUnit test cases and I tried to create a test case for the send email method, in which I invoked the send email method manually in the code for the test case. I think that may have messed up the EJB timer, since my method stopped working soon after I started running the JUnit test cases. Any thoughtsp

Negative 1617 pI have a problem with deciding the right way or writing a module. I THINK I know the theory behind the dependency injection and what are its advantages but perhaps I am mixing something or do not have a very clear image.p  pA rather simplified example would be p  pI have a model for my object and here I inject a validator class that handles the various validations p  precode index.php  ...... model  new Model modelgtsetValidatornew Validator modelgtgetValidatorgtexampleValidateCall  ......   validator.php class Validator implements ValidatorInterface      .....     public function exampleValidateCall         code goes here      codepre  pMy problem here is that I need for instance access to the settings  entity witch defines the behaviour of the model. Because the settings define the model, I do not think that I should pass theese settings inside the validator.p  pOne option would be that the validator will extend the model, but I think that would be bad practice  because the whole dependency injection concept goes kaboom... or not  . I could do something like p  precodemodelgtsetValidatornew ValidatormodelgtgetSettings codepre  pbut this looks even more idiotic from my point of view. p  pOne better solution, again from my point of view, would be to pass a new object to the validator constructor p  precodemodelgtsetValidatornew Validatornew Settings codepre  pbecause in reality settings do not have dependency with the model, but that seems to complicate a little too much. And also the settings entity is constructed inside the model because it defies some of the behaviours.p  pWhat would be the best practice in writing these objects  dependencies  p

Negative 1617 pI would like to know if there is a way to get the ViewPager child scroll position but when the user doesnt scroll it phisically.  I mean, when the user scrolls the viewpager, you can get the scroll position using the OnPageScrolled method inside the OnPageChangeListener, but if the user doesnt swipe from the start of the pager to the end of it, it will only return the scroll position while the user is touching it, so if he only swipes to the middle of the viewpager, sufficient for the viewpager to change the page automatically, while it scrolls automatically it doesnt return the scroll position. I dont know if I explaned it well... I hope pp  pThank you.p

Negative 1617 pI have a program runs as a background process in which I installed a hook to capture EVENTSYSTEMFOREGROUND events i.e  when the user switches between windows. The callback which is registered for the hook basically logs what application process exe filename the user has switched strongfromstrong and which they have switched strongtostrong.p  pI want to add some code to check if the application they have switched strongfromstrong is still active if not we assume they have closed it and that is what has brought a new window into the foreground. I am testing for its existence by trying to create a handle to the previous PID using a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenielibrarywindowsdesktopms684320vvs.85.aspx relnofollowOpenProcessap  precode    Check prev pid still exists  if not, assume the previous app has been closed     HANDLE hPrevProc  OpenProcessPROCESSQUERYINFORMATION  PROCESSVMREAD,false,gprevPid     if hPrevProcNULL         prevProcStillRunningfalse          else         CloseHandlehPrevProc      codepre  pAssumptions with the code abovebr gprevPid is populated with a PID  I have verified thisbr prevProcStillRunning has been initialized to truep  pThe problem with the code above is that for some reason, even when the user has exited an app say notepad.exe for example.

Even though I can see in the task manager that the Notepad.exe process has dissapeared and yes I only have one instance of it opened, somehow, the OpenProcess line still can get a handle on that PID. I am guessing that somehow the PID actually still exists but it may be in a state where its terminating. I have found that if this code is called a few more times, eventually it will return null. p  pI would like to find out a better way I can test whether hPrevProc is still acitive.
