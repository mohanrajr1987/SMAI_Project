Positive 1372 pI am a beginning JS programmer developing in Angular but now I got assigned this task create a library that accesses phones GPS module, gyroscope and accelerometer and possibly a compass to gather acceleration, position and some other data. Its not a whole lot of code really.Now, creating the library itself in C is already done by a colleague but I need to know if there s a way to include objectiveC and java code as well into the library which would be the platform specific code for iosdroid respectively.  The result literally has to be a single dll file and it must be useable in xamarin. The requirement even was for the library to work with angular which I have no idea if is even possible. It would be a bonus if it could.  What options do we have in accomplishing thisp

What Im trying to accomplish is to have an Alarm go off when Im within a certain proximity to these points. I know the OpenGEO suite along with QGis has some GPS functions but what Im looking for is something that can be used by someone either VIA web or a PC or mobile Application that will alarm on proximity. I have also been looking into Leaflet and OpenLayers in hopes I can do it through these map librarys or in junction with them. p  pWhat are some ways I could do this Please do not give me any code because I like to research things to learn. I just need some guidance. Thanks in advancep

Positive 1372 pIm building an app that track user movement. I found on the net and Im still  blocked about how to get a reliable user location. p  pFor that purpose, I started by use the GPSPROVIDER to get user location every minutes. But that drains a lot of battery. Now Im using NETWORKPROVIDER which have better yield on battery, but as per my understanding, is not really accurate.p  pSo firstly, I want to know to deal between usage of those providers to have good yield regarding battery consumption and user location accuracy.p  pSecondly, I read there a hrefhttpssource.android.comdevicessensorssensortypes.htmlsignificantmotion relnofollowSignificant Motiona  that p  blockquote   pAt the high level, the significant motion detector is used to reduce the power consumption of location determination. When the localization algorithms detect that the device is static, they can switch to a low power mode, where they rely on significant motion to wake the device up when the user is changing location.p blockquote  pDoes it mean that this sensor is already used by GPSNETWORK or that applications have to implement the described behaviorp  pThanksp

Negative 1372 pIm using codeTransaction BindingExplicit Unbindcode in the connection string as recommended a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netryangaraygayarchive20080414issuewithsystemtransactionssqlconnectionandtimeout.aspxherea since Im also using TransactionScope with timeout. The problem is that the connections does not seem to close after being disposed and eventually there are no more connections available in the connection pool. I got the same result when I modified the TransactionTimeoutIssueDemo see the link and ran TransactionScopeTest with the explicit unbind connection string enough times in a loop to use up all available connections in the connection pool. Default value for connections in the pool is 100 but this can be changed by using the setting codeMax Pool Size 10code for instance. It seems that the connections will not be released when using explicit unbind even though both the SqlConnection and the TransactionScope are used with the codeusingcode clause.

Negative 1372 pOn my machine XP, 64 the ASP.net worker process w3wp.exe always launches with 5.5GB of Virtual Memory reserved. This happens regardless of the web application its hosting it can be anything, even an empty web page in aspx. p  pThis big old chunk of virtual memory is reserved at the moment the process starts, so this isnt a gradual memory leak of some sort.p  pSome snooping around with windbg shows that the memory is question is Private, Reserved and RegionUsageIsVAD, which indicates it might be the work of someone calling VirtualAlloc. It also shows that the memory in question is allocatedreserved in 4 big chunks of 1GB each and a several smaller ones 14GB each.p  pSo I guess I need to figure out whos calling VirtualAlloc and reserving all this memory. How do I do thatp  pAttaching a debugger to the process prior to the memory allocation is tricky, because w3wp.exe is a process launched by svchost.exe that is, IISASP.Net filter and if I try to launch it myself in order to debug it it just closes down without all this profuse memory reservation. Also, the command line parameters are invalid if I resuse them which makes sense because its a pipe created by the calling process.p  pI can attach windbg it to the process after the fact which is how I found the memory regions in question, but Im not sure its possible at that point to determine who allocated what.p
Negative 1372 pthis is regarding the Ramaze.net frameworkp  pI ran into some really strange problems while storing custom Objects in session. I noticed that only the attributes on the objects immediately stored in session were being updated. However, if those objects contained references to other objects, those referenced objects were not updated if the immediate objects contained in session did not change during the request.p  pThis problem only became apparent to me when using RamazeFileCache as my session caching backend. I believe the problem is masked or not an issue when using inmemory sessions.p  pI discovered the problem is because of a shallow copy in the session logic found in RamazeSessionHashmethodmissing libramazecurrentsessionhash.rb.p  pAs a quick test to make sure my thinking was correct, I commented out the difference check, essentially forcing session to be updated every time.p  precode  def methodmissingargs, ampblock     old  hash.dup     result  hash.sendargs, ampblock     unless old  hash       Cache.sessions[session.sessionid]  self     end     result   end codepre  pThis little hack fixed my problem. Now my questions arep  ol liis it a safe and reasonable solutionli liShould I just avoid storing complexdeep objects in sessionli liIs there something Im missingli ol
Negative 1372 pHopefully Im just missing something obvious, but Im trying to get my head around the differences between the Load and the Shown events in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWindowsForms relnofollowWindows Formsa.p  pTraditionally, Ive only used Load or actually OnLoad, since I think its cleaner to override a method than to rely on the designer to hook up an event on yourself, since that is available in all versions of .NET. With .NET 2.0 the Shown event was introduced.p  pNow, if you look at the descriptions for these in the MSDN documentation Load Occurs before a form is displayed for the first time., Shown Occurs whenever the form is first displayed. it emsoundsem like the Load event should occur, then the form should become visible, then the Shown event should occur the combination of the two thereby letting you carry out some tasks both before and after the form is visible. Makes sense, rightp  pHowever, experimentation has shown that the Shown event invariably occurs embeforeem the Load event, whenever I try it and both occur before the form becomes visible. And yet, when I google around whenever I discover a page that talks about the order these events are fired in, they always list the Load event being fired first.p  pAm I just going crazy, or have I missed something And if they do occur at about the same time, then why was the Shown event added in the first placep  pMy current solution for doing something both before and after showing the form is to use OnLoad for the before showing stuff and start a shortduration oneshot timer for the after showing stuff. Which works OK and reliably, but its a bit ugly and I was hoping there was a cleaner solution. But it looks like the Shown event isnt it.p

Negative 1372 pA forthcoming project requires that a Flash projector .exe be kept on a server and accessed by multiple users over network LAN. There will be a central access database as a backend. I am using a third party SWF2EXE SWF Studio product to have database functionality. I would like to know if sharing an .exe file this way is practical.

The service is designed primarily for surveying, and as such returns coordinates in a UTM XY format.  My system stores coordinates as decimal latitude and longitude for integration with Google Earth and other mapping tools.p  pId like to come up with an algorithm for converting from XY to latitude and longitude for all cases.

Negative 1372 pThe diff functionality in git has copy detectionif it detects that a new file is actually a possibly modified copy of an existing file, the diff output shows the differences between the source file and the new file rather than just a bunch of additions from a blank file to the new file.p  pAs far as I can tell, codegit diffcode uses some heuristics to detect this situation. Unfortunately it is not detecting a particular new file as a copy of another file because I guess it has changed too much. Id still like to view the diff as though it were a copy.

Negative 1372 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI admit, this question stems from an ultimate lack of deep understanding of the underlying mathematics involved with digital signal processing Im still learning.p  pI want to take a set of amplitude samples, say 1024 single channel, and bring them into the frequency domain.  Obviously this requires a FFT no problem there.  The problem is that this only gives me frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency or 10242.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIf I have a stereo signal, can I merge the signals to produce 2048 amplitude samples thus returning 1024 frequency values  Im looking to get higher resolution in the frequency domain.p  pSo, can this be done strongandstrong return meaningful frequency data  Is there any other way to take a stereo signal and end up with higher resolutions in the frequency domainp  pstrongWhat Ive Found So Farstrongp  pI came across an article that suggested taking the left signal and making it the real value and the right signal and making it the imaginary value of the complexvalue for the FFT.  This doesnt make sense to me, perhaps because I dont understand the math.  I did try it, and it seemed to work, but I had signal leakage.  So I applied a Hanning window, but that resulted in only 512 usable values after processing.p

Negative 1372 pI am building pages dynamically using a database to store the page info and .NET C to build pages.  Part of that process is to set the masterpage in the codebehind based on what is in the database and, as I understand it, that has to be done in codePagePreInitcode.p  pMy problem is how to pass objects and variables from codePagePreInitcode to codePageLoadcode.p  pI have been able to make it work as follows, but am having random compiling errors when using this methodp  precodepublic partial class BuildPage  System.Web.UI.Page      protected static string pageData      protected void PagePreInitobject sender, EventArgs e               SET pageData  DATA FROM DATABASE, AND SET MASTERPAGE            protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               USE pageData TO BUILD AND DISPLAY THE REST OF THE PAGE        codepre  pFor various reasons, Im am not using Visual Studio to compile the page, just letting .NET compile on the fly at the first page request.  I have gotten two error messagesp  p1 CS0102 The type BuildPage already contains a definition for pageDatap  p2 ASPNET Make sure that the class defined in this code file matches the inherits attribute, and that it extends the correct base class e.g. Page or UserControl.p  pThe strange thing is that sometimes the page compiles on the first web request.  And, for those times that it doesnt on the first request, after a random number of page refreshes, it will compile perfectly.  After it compiles everything appears to work fine until I make another change to the code behind and it has to recompile.p  pI seem to only get those compiling errors when using that method to share variables between codePagePreInitcode and codePageLoadcode.  In other words, if I simply request the data twice from the database, once in PagePreInit and once in PageLoad I never get those errors.  But I really would rather not double the database load.p  pSo my question really has two parts, first, is that an acceptable way to share variables or is there a better way to pass data from codePagePreInitcode to codePageLoadcodep  pAnd second, if that is an acceptable way, are the errors unrelated and has anyone seen similar errors that simply go away after repeated web requests beforep  pThanks for any and all help fodderp

To put it simple, I used   Sockets to download the file and that solved my issue. Basically a GET   request for the desired file, I wont go into details on how to do it,   because Im sure you can find plenty of how to right here on SO in   order to do the same yourself. Although this doesnt mean that my solution is also the best for you, my first advice is to read other answers and see if any are useful.p      pWell anyway, since this questions has seen some recent activity, I thought about adding this update to include some hints or ideas that I think should be considered by those facing similar problems who tried   everything they could think off, and are sure the problem doesnt lie   with their code. strongLikely to be the code for most cases, but sometimes we just dont quite see it, just go have a walk and come back after a few minutes, and you will probably see it point blank range like it was the most obvious thing in the first place.strongp      pEither way if youre sure, then in that case I advise to check weather your request goes through some other device with caching capabilities computers, routers, proxies, ... until it gets to the intended destination. p      pConsider that most requests go through some of such devices mentioned before, more   commonly routers, unless of course, you are directly connected to the    Internet via your service provider   network.p      pIn one time my own router was caching the file, odd I know, but it was the case, whenever I rebooted it or connected directly to the Internet my caching problem went away. And no there wasnt any other device connected to the router that can be blamed, only the computer and router.p      pAnd by the way, a general advice, although it mostly applies to those who work in their company development computers instead of their own. Can by any change your development computer be running a caching service of sorts It is possible.p      pFurthermore consider that many high end websites or services use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiContentdeliverynetworkContent   Delivery Networksa CDN, and depending on the CDN provider,   whenever a file is updated or changed, it takes some time for such   changes to reflect in the entire network. Therefore it might be   possible you were in the bad luck of asking for a file which might be   in a middle of a update, and the closest CDN server to you   hasnt finished updating.p      pstrongIn any casestrong, specially if you are always requesting the same file over and over, or if you cant find where the problem lies, then if possible, I advise you to reconsider your approach in requesting the same file time after time, and instead look into building a simple a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWebserviceWeb Servicea, to satisfy the needs you first thought about satisfying with such file in the first place.p      pAnd if you are considering such option, I think you will probably have a easier time building a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRepresentationalstatetransferRESTa Style a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWebserviceWebAPIWeb APIa for your own needs.p      pI hope this update is useful in some way to you, sure it would be for me while back.

The weird thing is that it emdoesem work after I inspect it with FireBug or the builtin element inspector on Chrome.

Negative 1372 pIm trying to understand the timing of the event loop with animate and DeferredCommand. Ive got LayoutPanel that has a navigation column on the left like Outlook and then the remainder of the screen can toggle between being split vertically between 2 panels, or the bottom panel when it is split can be set to fill the rest of the screen. Ive got the layouts and basic animation between them working, but Im trying to delay the resizing of the bottom screen with a DeferredCommand. The reason for this is that when going from fullscreen to half screen for the bottom panel, I want to resize the bottom panel strongafterstrong reducing it down to half size. If this doesnt happen, the bottom panel is resized to halfsize while still being displayed full screen, and then the animate happens.p  pHowever, this is exactly what is happening, and which I was trying to avoid with the DeferredCommand. So it appears that the DeferredCommand is executing before the animate.p  pHeres the code snippetp  precodesetWidgetTopHeight...make top panel half size setWidgetTopHeight...make lower panel half size, positioned halfway down animate500  DeferredCommand.addCommandnew Command      public void execute           ...resize Widget inside lower Panel       codepre  pThe lower panel that is being resized in the animate is a FlowPanel around the actual widget that is being resized in the DeferredCommand.

Negative 1372 pSo I know there are a lot of questions on getters and setters in general, but I couldnt find something exactly like my question.  I was wondering if people change the use of getset depending on different languages.  I started learning with C and was taught to use getters and setters.  This is what I understandp  pIn C and Java, a variable can either be public or private, but we cannot have a mix.  For example, I cant have a readonly variable that can still be changed inside the class.  Its either all public can read and change it, or all private cant read and can only change inside the class.  Because of this and possibly other reasons, we use getters and setters.p  pIn MATLAB, I can control the setaccess and getaccess properties of variables, so that I can make things readonly can directly access the property, but cant overwrite it.  In this case, I dont feel like I need a getter because I can just do emclass.propertyem.p  pAlso, in Python it is considered Pythonic to not use getterssetters and to only put things into properties if needed.  I dont really understand why its OK to have all public variables in Python, because thats opposite of what I learned when I started with C.p  pIm just curious what other peoples thoughts are on this.  Would you use getters and setters for all languages  Would you only use it for CJava and do direct access in MATLAB and Python which is what I am currently doing  Is the second option considered bad  For my purposes, I am only referring to simple getters and setters just returnset the value and do not do anything else.p  pThanksp

Negative 1372 pI have the need to create a system to store python data structures on a linux system but have concurrent read and write access to the data from multiple programsdaemonsscripts.  My first thought is I would create a unix socket that would listen for connections and serve up requested data as pickled python data structures.  Any writes by the clients would get synced to disk maybe in batch, though I dont expect it to be high throughput so just Linux vfs caching would likely be fine.  This ensures only a single process reads and writes to the data.p  pThe other idea is to just keep the pickled data structure on disk and only allow a single process access through a lockfile or token... This requires all accessing clients to respect the locking mechanism  use the access module.p  pWhat am I over looking SQLite is available, but Id like to keep this as simple as possible.  p  pWhat would you dop

Negative 1372 phow do we rename .xaml and .cs filesp  pwould like to be able to keep development in synch with the original sketchflow. i.e. sketchflow has features such as the ability to collect client feedback on a per screen basis, etc.p  p... I kind of answered my own question here, so Ill post it as a follow up.  Asked the original question 9 hours ago on the MS site without response... still trying to work out where the best place is to talk to the community, so sorry for the duplicate.p  hr  pTHE ANSWER IS THERE A BETTER ONEp  pContext Sketchflow is a prototyping tool.  In large teams possibly you want to keep the prototype seperate from the finished version, or theres a large prototyping phase.p  pMy view is that I really like Sketchflow.  Its one of the coolest things Ive seen for a while well done Microsoft.  p  p... so for me, I want the prototype to become a the finished product.  I want the designers to step in and make transitions whenever they want.  I want the designers to kick the process off, and the developers to put in the detail.  Id like our customers to be able to post feedback at any time during the build process.  btw get your developers to check out MVVM.  Its very cool.p  pMy bet is that the feedback could get lost if you make a breaking change a file rename  so just beware of that.  That wont be a problem for us.  Well get our file names to make sense and then mostly leave it alone.  Of course MS could fix this this by creating a globally unique id Guid for each screen that is created.  Perhaps theyve done this already.  If someone from MS reads this, please put this on your requested features list.p  pTHE ANSWERp  pSo here is the answer that works for mep  pdont try to handedit the xaml  cs, as all the cross referencing that you might be doing with behaviors will break if you arent really careful.  Typical files that need to be modified .csproj, Sketch.Flow, xxxx.xaml, and xxxx.cs.p  pTo auto do it, download a tool like Ultraedit.  Alternatively, you might be able to just use VS 2010 untested.p  pSteps with ultraeditp  pBACKUP YOUR PROJECT FIRSTp  ol lipSearchReplace In Files...pli lipFind in files... Screen119pli lipReplace with... Welcomepli lipIn FilesTypes... em.empli lipDirectory... li lipMatch Whole Word Onlypli lipHit Startpli lipfollow the promptspli liprename the files .xaml amp .cs to be Welcome. where  is .xaml or .cs .  Since I use SVN, this step gets done for me in one step no big deal.p  ul liIf using VS2010 for steps 1 through 8, be careful do longer string replacements first  e.g. Screen119 before Screen1.  I think VS treats  as a word break.  On ultraedit youll be fine.li ulli ol  pIf theres interest, in the spare time that I dont currently have, I could release a quick tool to do this on codeplex.p  p note because we are working with XML and XML is very particular about being correct,  I close expression blend down, and then reopen it again after the replacerename to see if I was successful  my screen map still has all the flow lines still drawn in.p

When the answer from the webservice returns, at first a thread is bound for processing the business layer service and then another for finishing the Page rendering.

Then, of course, the client would have to poll the server for the result which should have been saved somewhere.

Negative 1372 pIm using Bonjour with an NSNetService to publish a server from my iPhone.

My understanding is that calling the method [myNetService hostName] should give me that address. However, this call always returns nil.

Negative 1372 pGot a bit of an odd one but theres a reason behind my madness.  p  pI have a resource I have set up with some string properties on it, for example codeMenuAdminLabelcode and codeMenuAccountsLabelcode that have values like Admin and Accounts respectively.  I need to pass the label property names into a method and Im well aware I could just pass these in as strings like MenuAdminLabel and MenuAccountsLabel but I would like these to be validated by the compiler rather than being simple strings as there will be a lot of properties on the resource and I want to ensure each reference is correct.  p  pThe trouble is if I access codeResource.MenuAdminLabelcode I obviously get the value of the resource property rather than the property name, I can access the property list by using codetypeofLocalisation.Resources.GetPropertiescode but, again, Im having to use a literal string to get the property name from this rather than something explicitly using codeLocalisation.Resource.MenuAdminLabelcode that the compiler can validate.  p  pHow can I do thisp

Negative 1372 pThe storyp  pIve been developing a RoRapp in both my desktop and laptop. It was quite handy to commit changes made on another, push them to github and fetch amp merge on other.p  pThe starting point is this I committed latest changes on my desktop, pushed them to github and then fetched and merged them into my laptop. Then, I made some commits on laptop and pushed to github. Took the changes, merged to my desktop with noff. THEN, happened the probable source of all mischiefs I reverted the desktop to commit where it was before the latest fetch amp merge. Made some development work with it, committed, pushed to github. In the laptop, I did the revert as well, though I reverted it to a commit which was made somewhere between the latest fetch from github, fetched again and merged those. Some error messages came after reverting desktop and laptop both, but things worked still fairly well and I kept working on both machines.p  pUntil now. I tried to push from my laptop to github, which gives the following output        p  precode Counting objects 106, done.  error unable to find 5a2a4ac...  error unable to find bc36923...  error unable to find ecb0d86...   error unable to find f76d194...  error unable to find f899df7...

Negative 1372 pThis sounds like an abstract question, but Im trying to troubleshoot this project Im working on and I am at a loss.p  pI had to take over a project because the first developer was fired, so I made the rookie mistake of not starting it over from day 1.  Ive been fixing hundreds of mistakes and pretty much redoing everything.  Everything from nonsemantic code, inline layout elements, unnecessarily sliced text images, and having to convert everything from CSS2 to CSS3. p  pIm saying all this because there is way too much code to include on here, and Im hoping that maybe me describing my situation will dredge up someone elses bad experience to advise me.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrong   I have one page that nothing works on.  I deleted the appropriate CSS from the external stylesheet, and have been rewriting it in an internal stylesheet.  The two biggest problems Im having are that pseudo elements and pseudo classes arent working.  I struggled for awhile trying to figure out if it was something that I was using, but then I experimented with different pseudo classes like pfirstchild colorred and nothing.  p  pIm also having problems with image replacement on the page.  My usual textindent isnt working, the text just stays on the page.p  pIm not sure what other information would be relevant so if you need to see anything or ask any questions, please ask away.  I thank you in advance for saving a noob like me from pulling out her hair p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHeres a link with the page code a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsyrenZsj2T relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsyrenZsj2Ta  Everything else on the site works so I have to assume that it something to do with the code on the page.p

Negative 1372 pThis is one of those hard to explain questions. Ive tried my best below, hopefully it is clear what I mean.p  pEmails are coming in to an address strongfooexample.comstrong, and are being forwarded to another email address strongbarsubdomain.example.comstrong. The second email address further pipes the email to a simple script, but the script needs to actually know the second email address as it provides metadata that is crucial to sorting the message that is, the script gets piped any email sent to subdomain.example.com, and it needs to see that it got forwarded to strongbarsubdomain.example.comstrong in order to correctly process the incoming message.p  pOriginally, I thought that the virtual alias used to forward messages from strongfooexample.comstrong to strongbarsubdomain.example.comstrong would update the envelopeto header, but it remains unchanged the same. None of the other headers nor the received line reflect that the message was forwarded. My theory is that maybe the pipe instructions for strongsubdomain.example.comstrong can be updated to somehow pass the actual address on to the script, but I am not sure how.p  pFor reference, I have included a few examples belowp  pHeaders, after being forwardedp  precodeFrom senderexample.com Sun Dec 11 195340 2011 Envelopeto fooexample.com Received ...

Negative 1372 pThis question is by necessity a bit general it relates to the overall architecture of client side applications built with javascript and jqueryp  pIm building a jquery based quiz application. For initial purposes I am trying to develop it entirely client side, with all the question and answer data stored in object literals in the js files Im not particular concerned right now that the data would be exposed in the source. I want to build it so that this implementation could readily be adapted into an ajax solution where the question data would be pulled from a php file or database.p  pIve written a question generation function which takes in the object literal describing the question and renders it as html and inserts it onto the page. My question is what would be the best practice for storing the users answer data and implementing the io as the user proceeds through the quiz. The questions would be displayed sequentially and there will be a logic which selects from a two dimensional grid of questions to determine which question would be rendered next based on whether the user answered correctly and the coordinate position on the question grid of the question they were on.p  pHappy to post any code Ive already written if this would be helpful to providing an answer.

What I want to do when a user clicks the link to go to page 2 of the results is to intercept the link click and instead create a new ajax request using codetermmaampp2code as the data passed to the request.p  pSo, long story short, is there an easy way to get codetermmaampp2code from the event object passed the the anonymous function in my jQuery abovep

Ive been pursuing this skill with a passion lately, but Im still new at it and there is something I cant quite wrap my head around. Im hoping someone can explain it in a way that brings an epiphanyp  pLets say I create a web application that manages strongPeoplestrong in some way, and my Person object must possess a properties such as FirstName, LastName, HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvince, etc. Im using SQL Server for persistence... so common sense would dictate that the respective fields in the People table are all foreign keysp  precodeFirstName varchar50 LastName varchar50 HairColor tinyint EyeColor tinyint Ethnicity tinyint StateOrProvince tinyint codepre  pClearly this means that I have corresponding lookup tables for each of those fields i.e. HairColors table, EyeColors table, Ethnicities table, etc. and each of these lookup tables has an ID and a name. Of course the Name field in these lookup tables will be JOINed with my People data whenever I want to display anything useful about a Person.p  pSome key features of the site would bep  pstrong1.strong Enumerate People in a Gridview FirstName, LastName, HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvincep  pstrong2.strong Show an individual Persons details on a readonly page FirstName, LastName, HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvincep  pstrong3.strong Allow a user to update an individual Persons data on an update page FirstName, LastName, HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvincep  pstrongCase 1strong If I was enumerating a collection of Person objects in a gridview... each Person instance would need to display its HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvince properties strongas stringsstrong to be meaningful i.e. the Name field from the SQL lookup table, not its ID. Clearly my SQL sproc would have some JOINs to give me the appropriate string data I need to fill these text properties in each Person instance.p  pstrongCase 2strong Again my sproc would have a JOIN to bring back the human readable property names strongas stringsstrong, and I would display them in read only Label controls using something like myPerson.HairColor, myPerson.EyeColor, etc.p  pstrongCase 3strong Here Id be showing a page with dropdown lists for each of these properties i.e. valueHairColorId, TextHairColorName. My immediate instinct here would be to stronguse the IDsstrong of each property something like myPerson.HairColorId in order to loop through the DDL items and select a value which represents the hair color that the People table currently holds for this Person. If the user selected something different in any of the property DDLs, Id need to pass the appropriate SelectedId values to an UPDATE sproc, and modify the values in the People table for this particular Person.p  h1So that leads me to the ultimate questionh1  pHow do I best design a Person object such that it contains both the ID and Name for HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvince so I can subsequently use strongthe Namestrong when strongdisplayingstrong information, but strongthe IDstrong for initializing the update DDL controls... and ultimately processing strongupdatesstrongp  pAs Ive reflected on this... I have come to the conclusion that I need to create classes to represent the HairColor, EyeColor, Ethnicity, StateOrProvince properties.p  pThen my Person class, instead of being something like thisp  precodepublic class Person      string FirstName  get set      string LastName  get set       int HairColorId  get set      string HairColorName  get set       int EyeColorId  get set      string EyeColorName  get set       int StateOrProvinceId  get set      string StateOrProvinceName  get set      string StateOrProvinceCode  get set   codepre  pWould instead be expanded into something like thisp  precodepublic class HairColor      int Id  get set      string Name  get set    public class EyeColor      int Id  get set      string Name  get set    public class StateOrProvince      int Id  get set      string Name  get set      string Code  get set    public class Person      HairColor HairColor  get set      EyeColor EyeColor  get set      StateOrProvince StateOrProvince  get set       public Person               how do I initialize a Person from a SQL data row        codepre  pBut then if my Person class does look like the above... how on earth do I best initialize it whether individually or in a collection from a given row of data I get back from a SQL query I seem to recall that I shouldnt be newing things up in a constructor i.e. this.HairColor  new HairColordr[HairColorId, dr[HairColorName]... so Im wondering how a call top  precodepublic static IEnumerableltPersongt GetPeople      ...  codepre  pin my BLL might fill each user up with its data before it is added to the collectionp  pReally hoping someone can give me an a ha moment here...p

Negative 1372 pI have a linked list question that stems from this homework prompt I am about to post. it might help with the answer p  pSpecificsp  pThe Java String class is immutable you cannot change the contents.  This is sometimes a hindrance to what you want to do with a string i.e. make changes to the existing string.  So, for this assignment you will create a class called MutableString.  NOTEDISCLAIMER The Java API does have a class StringBuffer, which is mutable, but for the intents and purposes of this assignment well pretend we dont know about it   p  precodeAn object of the MutableString class contains the following operationsbehaviors  which means the class itself must contain the following methods  Character charAtint index returns the Character at the specified index in the string  if the index lies outside the string, throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException you must write this class  void setint index, Character ch replaces the existing Character at the specified location  if the index lies outside the string throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  void addint index, Character ch creates a new spot in the list for the Character at the index specified  if the index lies outside the string throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  Character removeint index removes the Character at specified index  if the index lies outside the string, throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  boolean removeCharacter ch removes the first occurrence starting from the beginning of the MutableString of the Character  if the Character is not found, return false  boolean removeAllCharacter ch removes all occurrences of the specified Character  if Character is not found, return false  void toUpper converts the current string to all upper case  void toLower converts the current string to all lower case  MutableString substringint start, int finish returns a string starting at the Character specified by start and concluding with the Character specified by finish  if start or finish is outside the the string, throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  char [] toCharArray returns a char array containing all the characters in the string  be sure and handle all cases  int length reportsreturns the length of the string  String toString returns a String containing all the Characters  String toReverseString returns a String containing all the Characters in reverse order  you must utilize recursion to accomplish this task  int compareToMutableString that allows comparison of two MutableString objects  this implies you will implement the Comparable interface for your MutableString class  void sort alphabetizes the letters in caseinsensitive fashion in ascending order  you must write the code for this sort no API calls are allowed codepre  pYou must use a linked list to represent the characters of the string you must write the  LinkeList class.  Your LinkedList class should contain fundamental operations for updating and modifying the list.  With this in mind, implement the List interface in the Java API.  For methods that you deem unnecessary for your LinkedLists functionality, stub those methods out and throw an Exception that contains information about what method was called and that it has not been implemented.  NOTE Make sure your LinkedList class does not do anything MutableString specific.  Feel free to use the following stubbed out LinkedList class for your assignment.  It may not contain all the methods you will need, but it does contain the methods from the List interface from the Java API.p  pMutableString must utilize the LinkedList behaviors methods wherever possible dont write code in MutableString that does the same thing as something in the LinkedList class.  Thus your MutableString will contain a field that is a reference to a LinkedList object.  BTW, this concept is known as delegation, a very important idea in software engineering and design.  Do NOT design MutableString so that it inherits from LinkedList.p  pEach Node of your MutableString should contain a Character  note that this does not mean the reference to the data in your node class shouldmust be type Character  that would make your LinkedList class specific to MutableString, and we dont want that in this case. p  pthe part I dont understand is the paragraph 2 above that talks about inheriting from the linked list class. I was always used to writing something like public class MutableString extends LinkedList but we cant do that and I dont really know how to start writing this mutablestring class without inheriting from the class. Help on explaining how to do it and the difference would be awesome. thanks.p  pIm not very good at linked lists so bare with this question    p

Negative 1372 pWe have been working on a incremental project for like 4 or 5 years using the technologies mentioned at the end.p  pThe project has been growing, and now i feel our methodology is not effective enough. Until now every programer that has worked on the project has had to learn the entire layer structure and technologies surrounding them, and every new feature is assigned to a single person.p  pSo we are delaying on delivery times, its really hard to train someone and make them productive, and people on the team feel overwhelmed, i dont think is a matter of money and resources, a debate is on, and i really feel like we should work in pairs and in layers, becoming specialized in certain areas and working in teams. How ever some argument that we cant work in layers because a person might not be able to finish his part because he wont be able to test it until the other member is over with his layer. Right now we are only 3 programers.p  pSo if you think that these suggestions make sense, what i need is some nutshell effective references of how can we turn this in a more positive dynamic as a team, how to work on layers with these technologies, i need to have practical solutions and arguments so we can turn the ship to the right direction. Can any one direct us to the right direction  it will be deeply appreciated.

Sorry I hope thats understandablep  pSo its a little like a tiered or a nested arrangement almost like a small folder tree where the new 3 thumbs hold different libraries of 8 thumbs no thats probably just made it even more confusing.. p  pI was keen that it was all done with mouse over the thumbs so its smooth and theres no clicking or reloading the page.p  pIve had a good look around but probably just need telling what termsphrasescommands to pop in my search engine.p  pGetting the 3 thumbs to change the 8 thumbs and the main image should be straightforward enough Im currently using thisp  precodeltimg src  imagesnicepic5thumb.png  onmouseover document.main.src  imagesnicepic5.jpggt codepre  pWhere the main big image isp  precodeltimg src  imagesnicepic1.jpg name maingt codepre  pAnd I guess it could be expanded to multiple images. Doesnt have to be done like this however, just whatever would work best, its making one mousover change multiple mouseover commands thats currently beyond me.p  pUltimately I aim to get all the transitions to fade.p  pVery grateful for a pointer in the right direction.p

Negative 1372 pI have set up Thrift on my local system  windows 7 , PHP 5.3.8, Apache 2.2.21, Thrift 0.80,APC . I have tried to run the ClientServer thrift programs generated from Thrift compiler however none of the programs work. Each one gives me an error  TSocket Could not read 4 bytes from  localhostpathtoclient port 80 . p  pI have enabled Socket extensions for PHP and tried using THttpClient and TSocket classes but none of these are working.  I have switched Protocol classes from TBinaryProtocol to TBinaryProtocolAccelerated with no results.  p  pI have gone through core classes of Thrift and I see that handle actually doesnt points to a file rather it points to localhost. I have tried giving it a file path but it still doesnt works. p  pI dont have much experience in Socket programming,  however I feel that I am doing most of things correctly. p  pYour help on the same will be highly appreciated. p
Negative 1372 pI want to make a long page consisting of multiple nodes each of the same Content Type. The page should have navigation on top of it that will allow to jump directly to the desired point of the long page, kind of like here a hrefhttpwww.apple.commacbookprofeatures.html relnofollowhttpwww.apple.commacbookprofeatures.htmla there navigation is under the picturep  pI used the Views module to assemble a long page from content, and for navigation I tried to use another View of the same content, only inserted in the top of the page as a block. I set this view to display grid of fields it looks good. Only I could not figure out how to make each cell in the grid to become a link to the content on the same page.p  pI tried modifying views template, but there rows variable turned out to be a string with already assembled html. Maybe I could possibly modify the content template, and insert some sort of condition that will change the way content looks based on what part of the page current view is located, but I am not sure how to do that either.p

Negative 1372 pI am running a Python script on windows 7 that opens a subprocess every few seconds. This subprocess opens a window and grabs focus, disrupting any attempt by the user to do normal work while the script is running. I do not have the ability to modify the subprocess code itself.

In other words, it need to open in the background, not force itself into the foreground.p

Negative 1372 pDoes anyone know of a simple HTML5CSS3 framework which applies a minimum of formatting with no need for custom class names Ideally it would take only properly laidout HTML5, and would position elements with a minimum of flexibility, using common rules for, say sidebar widths and the like.p  pWith HTML5 there much less need for custom class names, with elements like codeheadercode, codenavcode or codeasidecode, but I havent yet seen a framwork taking full advantage of that.

And that itch is a simple combo of plain HTML5 structure which assumes nothing about the design but defines everything semantically, with a simple CSS3 stylesheet which defines the actual layout. I can envision it using several stylesheets, with a base one defining the layout of elements and separate ones for actual design. It would be used as a simple starting point for various projects, which could be later customized individually.p  pApparently, I might need to go the way proposed by Wesley and write one myself...p

Negative 1372 pIve seen some claims that optimized PEG parsers in general cannot be faster than optimized LALR1 or LLk parsers. Of course, performance of parsing would depend on a particular grammar.p  pId like to know if there are any specific limitations of PEG parsers, either valid in general or for some subsets of PEG grammars that would make them inferior to LALR1 or  LLk performancewise.p  pIn particular, Im interested in parser generators, but assume that their output can be tweaked for performance in any particular case. I also assume that parsers are optimized and it is possible to tweak a particular grammar a bit if thats needed to improve performance.p

Negative 1372 pSo in my app, the user can create some content inside certain div tags, and each content, or as I call them elements has its own object. Currently I use a function to calculate the original div tag that the element has been placed inside using jquery selectors, but I was wondering in terms of performance, wouldnt it be better to just store a reference to the div tag once the element has been created, instead of calculating it later  so right now I use something like this  p  precode.div[valuedivID] codepre  pbut instead I can just store the reference inside the element, when im creating the element. Would that be better for performance p

Negative 1372 pI need to view some local saved somewhere in the iPad html  js contents with mobile Safari. By reading some threads it seems that the file protocol is disabled. Rightp  pIf so, the solution I see is to install an app which turns the iPad into an http server no need for support of php or anything else, load my contents there and access somehow them within the same device by codehttplocalhost...code or codehttp127.0.0.1...code with mobile safari. Is that actually possible Can someone please suggest me a good web server app which possibly does not require jailbrake or other hackingp  pThanksp
Negative 1372 pIm currently using Chef to try and automate deployment of a couple of servers and Im running into a bit of an issue. Long story short, I need to programmatically find the public dns of an AWS instance, but I cant seem to find any sort of command to do so. The instance is already a node, so Im looking for something similar to ChefConfig[nodename] but for the public dns instead ChefConfig[nodepublicdns] would do the trick...if it existed. Im sure that this functionality exists in some form since on creation of the node Chef spits out the publicdns field to the screen. p  pAnyways, thanks in advance guysp

Negative 1372 pIm unittesting a business object using Mockito. The business object uses a DAO which normally gets data from a DB. To test the business object, I realized that it was easier to use a separate inmemory DAO which keeps data in a HashMap than to write all the p  precodewhen....thenReturn... codepre  pstatements. To create such a DAO, I started by partialmocking my DAO interface like sop  precodewhendaoMock.getByIdanyInt.thennew Answer      Override     public Object answerInvocationOnMock invocation throws Throwable          int id  Integer invocation.getArguments[0]         return map.getid       codepre  pbut it occurred to me that it was easier to just implement a whole new DAO implementation myself using inmemory HashMap without even using Mockito no need to get arguments out of that InvocationOnMock object and make the tested business object use this new DAO.p  pAdditionally, Ive read that partialmocking was considered bad practice. My question is is what Im doing a bad practice in my case What are the downsides To me this seems OK and Im wondering what the potential problems could be.p

The third parties can have any database product mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, etc. I will need to perform two tasks, which are the followingbr br  1. On first start, replicate the full database onto the central mySQL databasebr br  2. Incrementally update the central mySQL database as changes are done to the third party databasep  pstrongProposed solutionstrong brbr  1. I intend on creating database crawlers in c per third party database. So say for example one of the third parties has an oracle database. I intend on creating a class which will query an oracle database for its definition and data and programmatically create sql queries to be executed by the central mySQL database.  ex create table XYZ id1 int, id2 int, Insert into XYZ values1,2, etcbr br  2. Here is the problem which is giving me the greatest grief. Id like to know if anyone has ever queried a database to effectively ask it what are your latest changes, or what are your changes since ddmmyyyy hhMMss. By changes i mean both data changes and data definition changes. ex add new column, update a [row][column] value, insert new row, etc.p

Negative 1372 pI know that its possible to let the user drag the content in a codeScrollPanecode around using codescrollDragcode, so that they dont have to use the scrollbars. However, with codescrollDragcode, it only works for the left mouse button. What I want to be able to do is pretty much the same, but for either the middle mousewheel or right mouse button. That way the user can use the left button for other functions.p  pDoes anybody know of a feature I may have missed that can do this, or a custom method Note that I dont want a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13253041middlebuttonclicktoscrollthisa, I just want codescrollDragcode with other mouse buttons.p

Negative 1372 pHi I have a problem with my Android app. I use a boolean method to change the function of the back button to make a layout change. As shown in the code if I use a if statement and if these things are true, the layout changes.

But if I copy the function and change the name eclipse wants to remove the  override, and then the method no longer works.p  pSo now the question is How can I create multiple KeyEventsp  precodeOverride public boolean onKeyDownint keyCode, KeyEvent event      if keyCode  KeyEvent.KEYCODEBACK ampamp lengthisopen  true          lengthisopen  false         setContentViewR.layout.length         return true           return super.onKeyDownkeyCode, event     public boolean onKeyDown2int keyCode, KeyEvent event      if keyCode  KeyEvent.KEYCODEBACK ampamp lengthisopen  true          lengthisopen  false         setContentViewR.layout.length         return true           return super.onKeyDownkeyCode, event   codepre

Negative 1372 pIve just finished implementing a successful read from an ADXL345 accelerometer from a PIC microcontroller dsPIC33 using i2c. All Ive achieved so far is reading the device ID correctly, which is a single byte. p  pAnyone that has used the ADXL345 before will know that to read data from any of the axis, X, Y, or Z, is broken into two bytes, DATAX0 and DATAX1 for example. The datasheet also specifically states To ensure data coherency, it is recommended that multibyte reads are used to retrieve data from the ADXL345, so the two bytes per axis need to be collected together.p  pMy question is, with i2c, how do I do this when the two bytes per axis are represented by two different registersp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIXjer.png alti2c process p  pThe image above shows the process needed for i2c transmission. To read from the accelerometer were looking at the bottom two graphs, and the datasheet quote Ive pasted above is suggesting I used the bottom graph multipleByte, but as Ive said the two bytes have two different register values 0x32 and 0x33 for DATAX0 and DATAX1 respectively.p  pHow do I get data from one axis in one grab The only way I see doing this is a singlebyte read with one register address, then doing it again with the second register address, then concating the two together to get the one axis data. p  pThis question also applies to collecting data from a variety of different devices on the same i2c bus, which will also have different registers. p  pCheersp

Negative 1372 pA property was added to a custom user control. Since then, Visual Studio has inserted generated code to every form that uses that user control. Now we want to remove that property because it is not going to be used. But obviously doing so causes compile errors. Is there a way to tell Visual Studio to remove the property from all that generated code It seems to me that putting something like [Obsolete]  should be enough to tell Visual Studio to remove it from the generated code. Is there some other wayp
Negative 1372 pNIO and TCP make a great pair for many connections. Since a new connection needs to be opened for each new client, each of these clients would typically need their own thread for blocking IO operations. NIO addresses that problem by allowing data to be read when it can, rather than blocking until it is available. But what about UDPp  pI mean, connectionless UDP does not have the blocking nature of TCP associated with it because of how the protocol is designed send it and forget it, basically. If I decide to send some data to some address, then it will do so, without delays on serverend. Likewise, if I want to read data, I can just receive individual packets from different sources. I dont need to have many connections to many places using many threads to deal with each of them.p  pSo, how does NIO and selectors enhance UDP More specifically, when would one prefer to use UDP with NIO rather than the ol codejava.netcode packagep

Negative 1372 pIm really searching for the answer to this.  I want to create a generic piece of code that just walks a directory tree.  Maybe its just a static class that contains one method.  No problem for that.  For each file that is not a directory, it does emsomethingem.  I thought that defining an interface for this emsomethingem was the thing to do I call it FileActionInterface.performAction for now, but Im not sure how to code the directory walker code to call this interface method which doesnt exist yet.  Ive seen and used other Java classes that have a method that says add Interface handler then that class will run your implemented interface.  If you drop nothing in, nothing happens.p  pSorry about grasping for the right words here.  How do I code this directory walker code to call the abstract codep  pPS All of these are good answers and Ive marked them as such.  How do they do it when a class has a addInterfaceHandler like method to the class  Im guessing that the class has its own implementation of the interface, but its empty possibly.  Then when you call the add method you either replace the class implementation or add to it like an array of interface implementations.p  pThanks again guys, Ill start trying out your different solutions.p

Negative 1372 pI have the following structure simplifiedp  precodeclass myType      static char data     more private data here public     public interface here  codepre  pcodedatacode is a resource shared between all the instances of codemyTypecode and it points to a dynamically allocated memory allocated by one of the instances upon initialization.p  pSo far so good. The problem arises when I need to free the memory pointed by codedatacode. Reference counting isnt a solution here because its a valid and possible situation to not have a single instance of codemyTypecode at some point of execution  and later a new instance can be created  thus the codedatacode must persist.p  pI need to free that memory upon driver unload but unload isnt related to the actual destruction of codemyTypecode objects, thus Im forced to free the codedatacode manually. This would be acceptable but codedatacode is and should be codeprivatecode and inaccessible from the unload handler. Sure, I can create a codestaticcode and codepubliccode codedestroycode function inside codemyTypecode but that doesnt seem right  after all I didnt need the codepubliccode initializer, so why would I need one to free the memory That data shouldnt be accessible from outside codemyTypecode instances.p  pIll appreciate any insights on the subject.p

Negative 1372 pLately Ive decided to jump on the minicomputer bandwagon out of curiosity. I bought a pair of Raspberry Pi and BeagleBoard since they were both so cheap I couldnt resist  but here is where my problems start. I had an idea for these devices before I bought them of course console app. I set them up to my router so they could be accessible installed raspbian for the RPi and ubuntu arm for the BeagleBoard and installed and here is where my headache begins. p  pI installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my laptop dualboot so that I would have access to an ARM compiler. Now before I proceed further I must tell you that I develop mainly in Windows environment but Im familiar with linux because of my sysadmin background. Anyhow, because I dont have much free time after work since I like to meet up friends and family, I like to be able to modify my source and cross compile under the Windows Visual Studio Ultimate 2012 at work when I feel free or I need to relax, under the Ubuntu on my laptop when I actually find the time and I want to have a simple procedure to compile for ARM on my laptop and have the binaries sent to the RPi and the BeagleBoard even if manually as well as compiling for x86 on Windows and Linux so that I could after all debug my code. p  pI read around how other people are doing it and I went with Eclipse CDT as my linux IDECompilerggdb and with Visual Studio under windows. Made my own directory structure but I find the Makefile requirement EXTREMELY tedious. It took me days to get into that thing and I am still not satisfied with it, being used to simple F5 under windows to get Build  Run Debug, all that beign well structured the way I want it. p  pAnyhow all went well at first, following the C11 standard and adding the appropriate flags under linux for it and then some weird errors started to show up, I couldnt even compile SQLite while this thing has been running perfectly under windowsvisual studio. After few days of trial and error I gave up and I come here, asking for an advice p  pHow do you guys, RPiBeagleBoard fans work with those computers, how do you set up multiOSmultiArch environment for debugging and compiling I find it extremely difficult to the point that Im considering using Java just so I could get my idea running lt . One way is to have all the libraries and compilers on the device itself and carry it around which is no problem as well but It does feel a bit medieval and after all the SD cards that I have are quite limited in size, having OS on them. p  pAny tips, links to guides, books are more than welcome. Even though English is not my mothers tongue, I dont mind reading booksarticles in it.p  pThanks in advancep  pP.S I carry the project around in a thumb drive. p

Negative 1372 pSo I was first introduced to the idea of a model when I learned WPF. The MVVM concept of a model seems to be more aligned to general business logic encased in a classset of classes. When I look at MVC though, the model seems to be lightweightclasses that are passed to and from the user via forms. Is this assessment correct, or are there situations where a model is something heavier does more than just hold and validate data input from the user. p

Negative 1372 pI was wondering how to generate a Controller for a derived Model. Let me give you a big picture. There is a strongManstrong class from which the strongUserstrong class is inherited. As I read in several EF tutorials, I didnt define DbSet in DatabaseContext class. Thus, as you may know there would be generated only strongone tablestrong on the SQL containing all the properties of strongMan and Userstrong classes besides a discriminator column. p  pThe problem appeared as I was trying to figure out a Controller class for User, but as it is not mentioned in the DatabaseContext, MVC cannot create it and ends up with an error. Hence, I created a Controller for strongManstrong class, the strongparentstrong class. I also have done some modifications in the Controller to explicitly point to the User. I mean, using OfTypelt and as such. But as I came to the View which is created based on MVC scaffolding, I could not find any User properties, those that are dedicated to this class. p  pThe Following is the Man classp  precodepublic

I tried only registering to the DownloadProgressChanged event but the WebClient still stops after 1. And it is always 1, not 2 or 3...

Negative 1372 pIm using a hrefhttpscode.google.compjsonpath relnofollowJsonPath for Ca to query some JSON data.  JsonPath doesnt come with its own parser, so as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7537398howtousecsharpexampleusingjsonpath76066377606637Rick Sladkeys advicea, Im using a hrefhttpjames.newtonking.compagesjsonnet.aspx relnofollowJson.NETa to parse my Json string into a collection of nested codeIDictionarycode objects, codeIListcode arrays, and primitives.  Then I use JsonPath to filter it after adding the class suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7537398howtousecsharpexampleusingjsonpath76066377606637Rick Sladkeys answera.p  pFor reference, heres the part of my code that actually handles all thisp  precode string exampleJsonString defined below string query  .store.book[].title  we should get a list of all titles   step 1 use Json.NET to parse the json string into a JObject JObject parsedJson  JObject.ParseexampleJsonString    step 2 use JsonPath with a custom ValueSystem JsonNetValueSystem JsonPathContext context  new JsonPathContext              ValueSystem  new JsonNetValueSystem     step 3 get results using JsonPath Listltobjectgt toRet  context.SelectNodesparsedJson,         query.Selectnode gt node.Value.ToList codepre  pThe reason I was using JsonPath in the first place was because of its filter functionality.  You can not only do normal queries like code.store.book[].titlecode to get an array of all the titles in the book store, but also queries like code.store.book[.category  fiction].titlecode to get an array of all titles in the book store whose category matches fiction.  I need to be able to pass entire queries as a string, and so being able to filter while querying is extremely helpful.p  pUnfortunately, Im having some trouble getting this filter functionality to work.  I expect that Ill have to make adjustments to either the JsonNetValueSystem class defined originally in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7537398howtousecsharpexampleusingjsonpath76066377606637the aforementioned stack overflow answera or the JsonPath namespace you can get JsonPath.cs from a hrefhttpscode.google.compjsonpath relnofollowJsonPaths google code pagea.  If theres some external tool or an alternative parsing mechanism to Json.NET that would allow me to keep JsonPaths filtering without having to write too much extra code, that would be ideal, but Im pretty sure Ill have to alter either JsonNetValueSystem or JsonPath itself.  Both of these are fairly easy to alter since theyre just .cs files, but I cant really dig into Json.NET without a lot more work.p  pI cant actually seem to figure out where the original JsonPath code handles filtering, nor can I figure out why the JsonNetValueSystem class robs it of that functionality.  Any advice for how to add the ability to filter in the query string would be very much appreciated.

So Im trying to compare different websites in terms of their reachability in the network  i.e. whos more reachable I understand there is a wealth of network analysis techniques out there, but Im at a loss where to start really...p

Negative 1372 pThe original problem I am fighting is more complex but for investigating purposes I have simplified the test case to the followingp  ul liSingle fullscreen activityli liProgrammatically created web view that occupies roughly half of the horizontal screen space, 90 of the vertical space and is added to the root view via within the onCreate callli ul  pcode ViewGroup parent  ViewGroup getWindow.getDecorView.getRootView parent.addViewmyWebView codep  ul liweb view opens to google.com viali ul  pcodeloadUrlhttpgoogle.comcodep  ul liAndroidManifest.xml has the propertyli ul  pcodeandroidwindowSoftInputModeadjustPancodep  pWhen clicking on the search box on the google page the keyboard pops up but the web view itself is not shifted up as adjustPan indicates should happen.  The main activity also has a native text field that when clicked will shift the entire layout including web view up as expected.p  pThe behavior is present on 4.2.2 on both a Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus.p  pSo the question is how can I have the windowSoftInputMode property adjustPan be applied correctly to a web view instance so that when the soft keyboard is displayed the entire web view is shifted up by the vertical space taken up by the keyboard.p  pBefore I go down the road of trying to manipulate the layout manually within onMeasure I want to see if there is a consistent  better way to handle this.  The browser obviously handles this situation correctly so not sure why the web view is not able to handle this.p  pOne thing to note is that making the web view fullscreen or a separate activity are not possible options due to an existing architecture that I am not able to change.p

Negative 1372 pSo, Ive been struggling with a frankly now infuriating problem all day today.p  pGiven a set of verticies of a triangle on a plane just 3 points, 6 free parameters, I need to calculate the area of intersection of this triangle with the unit square defined by 0,0 and 1,1. I choose this because any square in 2D can be transformed to this, and the same transformation can move the 3 vertices.p  pSo, now the problem is simplified down to only 6 parameters, 3 points... which I think is short enough that Id be willing to code up the full solution  find the full solution.p  p I would like this to run on a GPU for literally more than 2 million triangles every lt0.5 seconds, if possible. as for the need for simplification  no data structures  librariesp  pIn terms of my attempt at the solution, Ive... got a list of ways Ive come up with, none of which seem fast or ... specific to the nice case too general.p  pOption 1 Find the enclosed polygon, it can be anything from a triangle up to a 6gon. Do this by use of some intersection of convex polygon in On time algorithms that I found. Then I would sort these intersection points new vertices, up to 7 of them On log n , in either CW or CCw order, so that I can run a simple area algorithm on the points based on Greens function On again. This is the fastest i can come with for an arbitrary convex ngon intersecting with another mgon. However... my problem is definitely not that complex, its a special case, so it should have a better solution...p  pOption 2 Since I know its a triangle and unit square, i can simply find the list of intersection points in a more brute force way rather than using some algorithm that is ... frankly a little frustrating to implement, as listed abovep  pThere are only 19 points to check. 4 points are corners of square inside of triangle. 3 points are triangle inside square. And then for each line of the triangle, each will intersect 4 lines from the square eg. y0, y1, x0, x1 lines. that is another 12 points. so, 1234  19 points to check. Once I have the, at most 6, at fewest 3, points that do this intersection, i can then follow up with one of two methods that I can think of.p  p2a Sort them by increasing x value, and simply decompose the shape into its sub triangle  4gon shapes, each with an easy formula based on the limiting top and bottom lines. sum up the areas.p  por 2b Again sort the intersection points in some cyclic way, and then calculate the area based on greens function.p  pUnfortunately, this still ends up being just as complex as far as I can tell. I can start breaking up all the cases a little more, for finding the intersection points, since i know its just 0s and 1s for the square, which makes the math drop out some terms.. but its not necessarily simple.p  pOption 3 Start separating the problem based on various conditions. Eg. 0, 1, 2, or 3 points of triangle inside square. And then for each case, run through all possible number of intersections, and then for each of those cases of polygon shapes, write down the area solution uniquely.p  pOption 4 some formula with heaviside step functions. This is the one I want the most probably, I suspect itll be a little... big, but maybe Im optimistic that it is possible, and that it would be the fastest computationally run time once I have the formula.p  p Overall, I know that it can be solved using some high level library clipper for instance. I also realize that writing general solutions isnt so hard when using data structures of various kinds linked list, followed by sorting it. And all those cases would be okay, if I just needed to do this a few times. But, since I need to run it as an image processing step, on the order of 9  10241024 times per image, and Im taking images at .. lets say 1 fps technically I will want to push this speed up as fast as possible, but lower bound is 1 second to calculate 9 million of these triangle intersection area problems. This might not be possible on a CPU, which is fine, Ill probably end up implementing it in Cuda anyways, but I do want to push the limit of speed on this problem.p  pEdit So, I ended up going with Option 2b. Since there are only 19 intersections possible, of which at most 6 will define the shape, I first find those 3 to 6 verticies. Then i sort them in a cyclic CCW order. And then I find the area by calculating the area of that polygon. p  pHere is my test code I wrote to do that its for Igor, but should be readable as pseudocode  Unfortunately its a little long winded, but.. I think other than my crappy sorting algorithm shouldnt be more than 20 swaps though, so not so much overhead for writing better sorting... other than that sorting, I dont think I can make it any faster. Though, I am open to any suggestions or oversights I might have had in chosing this option. p  precodefunction calculateAreaUnitSquarexPos, yPos wave xPos wave yPos   First, make array of destination.

Women share some common logic and individual logic. For example take a login. Men and Women need an email and a password to log in. Since its redundant to implement the same login logic twice I thought of creating a more abstract class, the codeUsercode, which is where I want to put everything which applies to men and women, like name, email, password, login logic etc...p  pThis is where it gets tricky with doctrine. Men and women will have individual fields to store in the database, yet they still need their common dataname, password etc..., so a simple codeclass Man extends Usercode might not work out correctly. I store the corresponding id of the codeUsercode on men and women. So there is an identification.p  pWhat I had in mind is, if I do codemengtgetPasswordcode it should use the codegetPasswordcodefunction of the corresponding codeUsercode object.p  pI hope I cleared up my intend.p  pKind Regards and thank you for digging through.p

When I tested my app on the iPad, most of the screen was grey and only the top corner had my game in it. I would like it to be able to auto size using just the xib files. Also, with the 4 inch and 3.5 inch iPhones, how can i make a view that fits them all I tried storyboard, but my app was based on .xib files. It is one view controller, but it loads a lot of different .xib s. What is my solution p

So to start I was trying to have my whole app associated with a View, binding some anchors  with internal links  to a click event which gets the href and navigate to that, like thisp  precodevar App  new  Backbone.View.extend  ... events       click a[datainternal]  function event           event.preventDefault         Backbone.history.navigate event.target.pathname,  trigger  true        , start  function              Backbone.history.start  pushState  true                    el  document.body    function  App.start  codepre  pThen i have the following htmlp  precodeltligt     lta hrefmessages datainternaltruegtltimg srcassetsimgmail.png altMensagens titleMensagensgtltagt ltligt codepre  pMy problem is, when the event is fired the event.target is always associated to the img child and not to the anchor.

Negative 1372 pIm using the Newtonsoft json.NET parser for JSON parsing.

Negative 1372 pThe goal is to make a pdfgenerating service. The service is avaiable via simple servlet. p  pAssumptions made are such, that the service is supposed to be running on multiple loadbalanced servers e.g. Tomcat instances, with each server running its manually created threads, which generate PDFs. Each request has to be written to a database, and its pdf status has to be updated throughout the whole process, likep  ul liQUEUED at firstli liIN PROGRESS when the pdf generation startsli liPROCESSED after a pdf is createdli ul  pAnother assumption is that each Tomcat instance which got the request is responsible for generating the document.

Negative 1372 pWhat is the best practice for having a codeListltTgtcode in the business layer that needs to be displayed on a UI I currently use databinding with an codeObservableCollectionltTgtcode in the viewmodel that duplicates the data of the codeListltTgtcode. The obvious problem of this is when the codeListltTgtcode is modified in the business layer the codeObservableCollectionltTgtcode needs to be recreated so the changes of the codeListltTgtcode are reflected in the UI. This cant be the best way.p  pI also will not accept using an codeObservableCollectionltTgtcode in the business layer as an answer.p  pThanksp

Negative 1372 pSo I am not asking anyone to solve this for me, but I do need some help. I am pretty new to ObjectOriented Programming, but its starting to make sense for me. Below is the code I have so far for the War card game. I am not concerned with the Suits at the moment, though I do know how to add them in if need be. Basically, my next step is to figure out how to deal 26 cards to each player. p  pWhat this code does now is shuffles the deck using the FisherYates algorithm, and outputs a string containing the now shuffled deck. I thought this would return an array since I was using the toa method, but I dont think thats the case.p  pHow do I then deal this deck to each player Do I need a Class for the Table or players Any help in the right direction would be awesome. Again, please do not solve it for me. I want to figure this out for myself as much as possible.

Negative 1372 pI am running into a very frustrating series of problems. I would like a definitive solution thus, I will award bounty for this question.p  h2Requirementsh2  ol lipGenerate a list of pairs of codeEditTextcode views that automatically retain their values on orientation change screen rotation. pli lipThe number of codeEditTextcode pairs is determined at runtime.pli ol  h2Failing method Use a codeListViewcodeh2  pUse a codeListViewcode that has an codeArrayAdaptercode. The array adapter uses a layout to generate each pair of codeTextViewcode views. The XML for a codeListViewcode item might appear asp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidlayoutwidthmatchparent   androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt    ltEditText     androididideditfirst     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt    ltEditText     androididideditsecond     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pThe codeArrayAdaptercode would simply inflate the layout for each view.p  precode  Override   public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent         LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflatercontext.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE      View row  inflater.inflateR.layout.listviewpair, parent, false codepre  pThe values entered into the codeEditTextcode are not retained on orientation change. Since the codeEditTextcode views are instantiated through the codeArrayAdaptercode, the Android runtime has no way of automatically prepopulating the codeEditTextcode views with their last state before rotation. This means we must saverestore userinput manually  failing requirement 1.p  h2Failing method Use a codeTableLayoutcode and codeTableRowcodesh2  pInstead of using a codeListViewcode, we can inflate one codeTableRowcode layout for each codeEditTextcode pair and attach it to the codeTableLayoutcode. Since we only know the number of pairs at runtime per requirement 2 we must instantiate the layout programmatically. Something likep  precodefor int i  0 i lt numPairs i    TableRow row  TableRow View.inflatethis, R.layout.tablerowpair, null   table.addViewrow  codepre  pThis also fails to retain state on orientation change. Each pair of codeEditTextcode views has the same codeIdcodes as all other codeEditTextcode pairs in the codeListViewcode. This happens because we instantiate the same layout for each item in the list thus, they all have the same codeIdcodes. On rotation, Android will give every pair of codeEditTextcode values the same values since they share the same codeIdcode.p  h2Recapitulationh2  pSo, is there a way to create a list of codeEditTextcode pairs that retain their state automatically upon orientation change It seems like there must be a way, yet researching this question is difficult because its a fairly specialized use case. I would be glad to reward some bounty for somebody who can give me a nice explanation of this situation.p

Negative 1372 pI have an activity that displays a screenshot of a map fragment, along with some other things. Everything shows up perfectly until a second or two later when the app crashes. This is only happening on Android phones using 4.4.2 kitkat, but not on tablets. After the first attempt to load this view, it will sometimes crash before even displaying anything when setContentView is called. Since it crashes at a different time each time I test, I assume something is happening on a background thread, and since its a Fatal signal 11 I assume its some sort of strange memory problem, but other than that I really have no clue whats going on.p  pHeres the activity     public class TransactionDetailActivity extends CommonActivity implements Animation.AnimationListener p  precode

Negative 1372 pI have to make an mac os x app that has some awful specifications. I managed to make the app but now I am stuck at the codeinstallercode phase. I have to copy the app to the application folder easy from a cd not dvd but a 700 mb cd keep that in mind and 300 to 500 mb zip file, containing webpages and resources, in the app folder AppName.app and unarchive it there in a codewwwcode folder.p  pI tried doing this with a codepackage installercode and a codeshell scriptcode unfortunately the script runs in a codesandboxcode and I cant access the content form the cd.p  pI cant put the zip files in the install package because there is a windows and a linux installer that uses them too. So its a shared resource.p  pIve tried different approaches to resolve this issue, none seemed to work.The only solution that is in my head right now is to make another app in codeobjective ccode that will run from the cd witch will copy the real app and the zip file to the applications folder. p  pI must have an friendly executable installer for the app and that is my only desperate choice at the moment. Is there any other way to do thisp

Negative 1372 pIn AngularJS it has the ability to route a section of the page using strongngviewstrong.  This is really nice for smaller projects but as projects get larger it does not scale very well due to the inability to load scripts in the strongscriptstrong tag.

Negative 1372 pActually we are building an authoring tool through which authors will prepare some assessment. Assessment can be kind of MCQ or Multiple choice. Now in that assessment imageaudiovideo can be a part of question as well as answers. Now to store all these assessment we will use alfresco repository. Now while storing or creating the assessment authors can define or create different custom properties for image file or any type of file. we have to provide those kind of facilities while creating the assessment to authors. Now our system can talk to different enterprise content management system, thats why we are planning to use CMISRESTful services of alfresco. We found those RESTful api through which we can createupload directoryfile in an alfresco repository but till we did not find any RESTful api to create custom metadata in alfresco. Do alfresco have any RESTful API to create custom metadataproperties while uploadingcreating new file in alfresco If not what are the other ways Is there any way apart from configuration or settings changes so that we can create those custom metadata on the fly API will be good as because we can use them directly from UI using jquery or angular.. any help regarding this will be much appreciated. p

Negative 1372 pI have built a small application with MySQL. Database Type is InnoDB. And its hosted on some server. I am facing database crash so many times. When I asked reason from hosting provider they said to mep  blockquote   pThe problem was caused by an InnoDB database corruption which required a rebuild of all InnoDB tables. Some databases didnt rebuild properly though such as yours and it required to be fixed manually. That is what I did. No changes are required to be done from your end. We do not expect the problem to happen again anytime soon. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.p blockquote  pI told them I must have to use InnoDB because I need primary and foreign key relationship  which is with InnoDB. Now they are saying p  blockquote   pWell that is correct, MyISAM does not support foreign keys. Actually InnoDB based tables are prone to get corrupt if MySQL is abnormally shutdown e.g. in case of a hard reboot or so. MyISAM instead is more reliable and repairing its tables are easy. p blockquote  pMy QUESTION InnoDB based tables are prone to get corrupt if MySQL is abnormally shutdown, is this correctp

Negative 1372 pIts a little challenging to articulate what Id like to ask, so please bear with me.p  pI understand that, in Angular.js, directives are sort of the magic behind dynamic markup. What one might have once accomplished strictly via jQuery, one now accomplishes via directives. I understand that Angulars HTML compiler traverses the DOM in search of attributes andor elements corresponding to programmatic directives and links these elements to their respective directives. What Im wondering is whether theres a way to accomplish this sort of association along with the generation of directivebound DOM elements without the need for the directive to first exist within the DOM.p  pSuppose I have a directive that Id like to use to build an entire seating chart, with sections, rows, seats, etc. The chart could reflect different seating arrangements based on venue, so the template must be able to dynamically render the chart from data representing every little UI component on the chart. I dont understand how one should go about accomplishing this sort of thing using Angular.p  pWould it make sense to use a single directive to generate the UI in its entirety, or should I have nested directives Im guessing the latter. And, if the latter, what is a good way of structuring nested directives in such a way that they do not rely on markup and can be generated programmaticallyp

Negative 1372 pI am trying to be able to manage multiple instances of Selenium at the same time, but havent had much luck. Im not 100 sure if its possible. I have an application with a GUI built with PyQT that retrieves our clients information from our SQL database. Its a fairly simple app that lets our users easily log in and out of our clients accounts. They click the clients name, press Login, it launches an instance of Firefox, logs into the account, and stays open so the user can do whatever they need to do. When they are done, they click the Logout button, and it logs out of the account and quits the webdriver instance.p  pWhat Im trying to provide is a way for them to log into multiple accounts at once, while still maintaining the ability to click one of the clients names that they are logged into, process the logout on that account, and close that browser instance. p  pOne thing I was hoping is to be able to control the webdriver by either a process ID, or unique ID, in which I can store in a dictionary linking it to that client, so when they click the clients name in the app, and press logout, it uses something in PyQT like clientname  self.listitem.currentItem.text to get the name of the client they have selected which Im already using for other things, too, finds the unique ID or process ID, and sends the logout command to that instance, and then closes that instance.p  pThis may not be the best way to go about doing it, but its the only thing I could think of.p  pEDIT I also know that you can retrieve the Selenium sessionid with driver.sessionid considering your webdriver instance is assigned as driver, but i have seen nothing so far on being able to control a webdriver instance by this sessionid.p  pEDIT2 Here is an incredibly stripped down version of what I havep  precodefrom selenium import webdriver from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore   class ClientAccountManagerQtGui.QMainWindow      def initself          superClientAccountManager, self.init          grid  QtGui.QGridLayout          Creates the list box         self.clientlist  QtGui.QListWidgetself           Populates the list box with owner data         for name in clientnames.itervalues             item  QtGui.QListWidgetItemname             self.clientlist.addItemitem           Creates the login button         loginbtn  QtGui.QPushButtonLogin, self         loginbtn.connectloginbtn, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.login           Creates the logout button         logoutbtn  QtGui.QPushButtonLogout, self         logoutbtn.connectlogoutbtn, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.logout       def loginself           Finds the owner info based on who is selected         clientname  self.clientlist.currentItem.text         clientusername, clientpassword  getcredentialsclientname           Creates browser instance         driver  webdriver.Firefox           Logs in         driver.gethttpswww.....comlogin.php         driver.findelementbyiduserNameId.sendkeysclientusername         driver.findelementbyidpasswordId.sendkeysclientpassword         driver.findelementbycssselectorinput[typesubmit].click       def logoutself           Finds the owner info based on who is selected         clientname  self.clientlist.currentItem.text           Logs out         driver.gethttpswww....comlogout.php           Closes the browser instance         driver.quit   def main      app  QtGui.QApplicationsys.argv     cpm  ClientAccountManager     cpm.show     sys.exitapp.exec   if name  main     main codepre

Negative 1372 pI load meshes from COLLADA files into SceneKit. Lets say I have a cube with a material that has a certain texture. Then in code, I want to make new copies of this SCNNode  I have used codeclonecode so far  and then I need to set a new texture. This is where it gets problematic because if I get the named material of one of the cloned cubes and update its texture codethematerialofmycube.diffuse.contents  somefile.pngcode, will set the same texture to all instances of the cube. codeclonecode obviously does not deep copy things like geometry, materials and textures. So what I have tried is making a copy of the geometry itself, and also tried making a new material, setting a new texture to the new material, and adding that material to the materials array of the new geometry, while also removing the old material. There seems to be no straightforward way of doing it this way the materials are named, but exist in an array so several materials could theoretically have the same name  which leads to some bulky addingremoving of objects from the array, and when I do it, the new textures show up, but they show up upside down, and also the order of materials seem incorrect as I get backside textures in place of frontside textures and vice versa. I hope I dont have to draw all this stuff in my 3d editor, there must be a good way of making new instances with arbitrarily specified textures in code.p  pWhat Im specifically doing is I drew a trump card in my 3d editor, and exported it to COLLADA. Now I have 52 pngs of trump card faces  I need to replace the faces of new instances of trump cards obviously.p

Negative 1372 pIm very new to rails and have been following Ruby on Rails Tutorial book by Michael Hartl these days. I feel like testing is a really important thing for developing rails applications since the testing part covers about half of the entire book. But the more I read the book the more overwhelmed I felt about those code because sometimes I would have to spend so much time learning figuring out the test code before I can actually move on to the real code for the application. So my question is, is it really necessary to learn rails and its testing at the same time or it is okay for me to learn the rails basics first and maybe buy a rails testing book to learn it in particular after I get familiar with everything about rails so that I will not be too overwhelmed and I could spend more time focusing on the features using rails. Thanksp

Negative 1372 pThis is probably a simple question, I havent been able to shorten it though.p  pI am testing a class of mine, codeClassToTestcode. In production, it will perform operations on a third party library object, instance of codeThirdPartyClasscode.p  pI want to mimic that class with a stub. Using the definition of stub as used by a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesmocksArentStubs.html relnofollowMartin Fowlers essaya emStubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside whats programmed in for the testemp  pThe problem isp  ul licodeClassToTestcode has a method codesetThirdPartyClassThirdPartyClass ocode. So to pass a stub to this, the stub would have to extend codeThirdPartyClasscode. This means my tests will have to use the third party library, whereas my unit test needs to be self contained.li ul  pThe reason is, my code will be run on an embedded system, and the library in question mostly executes native code. But I want to develop and test my code in isolation on my PC.

Negative 1372 pI recently ported this code in from another language. Its supposed to run through some probability estimations and continue running through them until it converges on a solution. Convergence is determined by the maximum change in any probability getting below a certain threshold. This works perfectly in the other language. On the first iteration, the max probability change should be 50, on the second, it should be 22, etc. and it should converge fairly fast.p  pHowever, in javascript, its going only two iterations before getting stuck and looping infinitely.

Negative 1372 pIm fairly new to the world of JS and its abundance of libraries.  Im looking to get into a project that involves network communication sockets between clients and a server.  In a world with tons of libraries, I cannot make a decision as to which to use.  Im looking for something that will bring efficiency and stability.p  pIve been told that Node.js is like the middleman between you, as the developer, and Socket.IO.  Ive been told its a huge framework that you may not use at least half of.  Ive been told that to maximize efficiency, youre better off using Socket.IO to make your own functionalities.  Ive done some research on my own and found that Socket.IO NEEDS Node.js and Node.js DOESNT NEED Socket.IO.  Which is completely opposite of what I was told.  Then I find that most developers use both Socket.IO and Node.js at the same timep  pLike I said, Im fairly new, but I cannot find the right resources that would help me accomplish a websocket communication between a client and a server with maximum efficiency, or at least explain the difference between Socket.IO and Node.js.

Negative 1372 pI was trying to create a simple RSA encryptiondecryption program using Java. However, the encryption and decryption doesnt seem to work.

Negative 1372 pIm working on a simple UDP messaging system and Ive got it mostly working. The structure is to have 1 server that simply broadcasts messages to all clients listening on a specific port its just for use on a LAN or adhoc network not connected to the internet, although my test PC is currently plugged into the web. My problem is that every time I send a message the client receives 2 copies. At the moment Im not setting the target IP as the subnet, so maybe this is the problemp  pNote I know Im violating the standard clientserver terminology, because my client is binding a specific port, but bear with me.p  pSo here is how my server specifies the target datap  precode   dsocket  socketPFINET, SOCKDGRAM, IPPROTOUDP     ifdsocket  1           printfnError in creating socket       return false         socket option set to 1 because we are setting the SOBROADCAST setting to true    MSDN says to use int for boolean option types.    int lsocketoption  1     setsockoptdsocket,                SOLSOCKET,                SOBROADCAST,                charamplsocketoption,                sizeofint     Zero out the broadcast address member to initialize it    memsetampdbroadcastaddress,           0,            sizeofdbroadcastaddress     Specify that     dbroadcastaddress.sinfamily  AFINET    dbroadcastaddress.sinport  htons34444    dbroadcastaddress.sinaddr.saddr  INADDRBROADCAST codepre  pMy client opens the port like sop  precodedsocket  socketPFINET, SOCKDGRAM, IPPROTOUDP     Set port so that calls to recvfrom do not block.

I also updated the server to broadcast only on the subnet it is a part of, but I dont think this had impact on the multiple receipts.p
Negative 1372 pis it possible to bring up a dialog box in android after every certain value provided by the user. In my app, the user can go up and go down value by 1 by pressing a button and what I want to do is allow the user to set a number e.g. 45 and after every 45 numbers the user goes up or down by, I want a dialog box to show up. p  pFor example, if the user want to see a dialog box after every 100 value then there would type in 100 in a textbox and start pressing the up and down button and when they value reaches the current value  100   100 then a dialog box will appear. For instance, after if the user has set the dialog box to appear after every 100 value then the dialog box will appear on numbers like 100, 200, 300 etc.p

Negative 1372 pI just would like to know if theres a way to know in the code when the device reboots and when the user kill the app.p  pIn both way, the codeapplicationWillTerminatecode method is called.p  pstrongHere is my use casestrong  Im using the GPS to allow my app running in background. With the codestartMonitoringSignificantLocationChangescode and codestartMonitoringForRegioncode methods, it allows the app to monitor location changes even when restarting device. As described above, codeapplicationWillTerminatecode is called in the same way than rebooting and if I stop GPS services, the app wont listen location changes after rebooting.p

Negative 1372 pI often meet this requirement and Ive never been satisfied with my solution. Im sure theres a better way but I just dont see it.br Requirementbr Authenticate a Windows user who also needs to be in a DB table setting IIS on Windows authentication mode.p  pBasically the client doesnt want to enter users and passwords all the time theyre intranet apps so no forms auth possible, but they set access and roles on the DB instead of the actual LDAP. This means that in the HttpContext the user will show as authenticated, but I still need to check on the DB if hes actually authorized to use this app and if so with what roles.br Right now I have a custom filter to check the user against the DB, but I dont want to check on the DB for each call. At the same time Im unsure on where I can store the User information Session Will a cookie work For extra challenge sometimes I dont have direct access to the DB but have to rely on web services or other interfaces.               p  pThank you.p
Negative 1372 pContext Im a beginner programmer, self taught in the hope of making a SPA. Ive started with JavaScript, Jquery, PHP and MySQL, and now feel pretty confident with all. Ive started with Ember, and am now moving away from having a PHP API to Node. Which has then brought me closer to Meteor... Im aware Ill need to use Mongo instead, but having an integrated front and back seems to be sensible and have some advantages. p  pstrongSo my question is what are the advantages of having a separate REST backend API eg Express rather than an integrated frontback eg Meteor.strongp  pOne that springs to mind is that my app will be tabletpc based, but in future Ill want a different mobile version, so Id be able to use just use the same API.

Negative 1372 pIm building a game prototype in JS which uses sockets for communication socket.io. When a command to disable dragging comes, I can either use the disable method, or destroy method. Both work fine but differently after the dragged div is released, however if the dragging is disabled while the div is being dragged which is 100 of the time, the behavior is not what is expected. p  pdisable  does nothing until the mouse is released, after which point its no longer draggable. destroy  kind of works. Smooth dragging stops, but Im still able to drag the div around and have it warp all over the screen, instead of being smooth. After its released, its no longer draggable. p  pSo, my question is. How can I temporarily disable dragging behavior of a div while its being dragged, and have it stop dead in its tracks Perhaps simulate the mouse release somehowp

Negative 1372 pLets say you have a group of numbers. You need to eliminate numbers until there is only one left. This is hard to explain, so let me provide you with an example.p  pThe numbers are 3, 6, 9, and 10.p  pYou pair 3 with 9. You eliminate 3. Note either one of them could be eliminated. Now there are 6, 9, and 10 left. You pair 6 with 9. You eliminate 9. Now there are 6 and 10 left. You pair 6 with 10 only option. p  pThe problem is I want to find the maximum value obtained from this elimination. Each time a number is eliminated, the XOR value of those two numbers is added to the count. In the previous example, the total value would be 3  6  6  9  6  10  10  15  12  37. This happens to be the maximum value that can be obtained from any elimination combination.p  pHow would I solve this problem in Java with 2000 numbers I know I can find every possible combination using brute force, but the run time of this was more than two seconds, and I prefer my solutions to be under two seconds. The only option left is Dynamic Programming. p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this with Dynamic Programmingp

Negative 1372 pMy process is that Jenkins polls SVN for a build every three minutes, performs a build when a change occurs, and creates a deployment package which it then pushes to Octopus.

Negative 1372 pIm having problems compiling a program called SDPB by following a hrefhttpsgithub.comdavidsdsdpbmacosxinstallation relnofollowthese instructionsa. To summarize, Im installing a program that requires Boost, GMP, and OpenMP on Mac OS X Yosemite. All the individual pieces of code compile but when its time to link, I get codeUndefined symbols for architecture x8664code.  My question is basically identical to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28889744undefinedsymbolserrorrelatedtompfstructforosx10102this questiona. However, I cant get the answers there to work for me. I still get the same error.p  pAfter more searching, I saw that people with similar questions were getting answers pointing to a conflict between clang and gcc. More specifically, there are issues with mixing the libraries libstdc and libc. p  pTherefore, I made sure to recompile both Boost and GMP with gcc so that everything would be built using libstdc. That didnt help. I then downloaded an implementation of clang that was compatible with OpenMP and tried to build everything using just libc. That also didnt work. I then tried all sorts of permutations using clang with the codestdliblibstdccode flag and so on. Nothing seems to work. The details of the errors seemed to change a bit with the various permuations. Ill post a few snippets below. Of course, I always used the updated makefile to compile SDPB and I always configured GMP with the codeenablecxxcode flag as the answers linked above said to do.p  pHere, is a snippet of the error I received while compiling SDPB with gcc after I compiled GMP and Boost with gcc as well.p  precodeUndefined symbols for architecture x8664   stdbasicstringltchar, stdchartraitsltchargt,

Negative 1372 pFor some time now, Ive been structuring my JavaScript Code like thisp  precodefunction      function Examplename, purpose          this.name  name         this. purpose  purpose           Example.prototype.getInfo  function          return The purpose of   this.name   is   this.purpose           Example.prototype.showInfo  function          alertthis.getInfo           var ex  new ExamplesomeModule, Showing some stuff.      ex.showInfo undefined codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6q76h0ps relnofollowFiddleap  pNow Ive realized that this pattern is far from ideal as is has some problems    p  ul liIt doesnt utilize closuresscope so simulate public amp private members.li liIt doesnt export something, meaning the module itself is not really encapsulated amp namespaced.  li ul  pDisclaimer I havent used it in any bigger project, so I might be missing some important details that occur when working under real live conditions.p  pTo solve these issues, I started looking into JavaScript design patterns. One of patterns that immediately appealed to me is the emmodule patternem.br I tried to rewrite the code above using the module pattern, but I cant get it quite rightp  precodevar Example  function       function getInfo          return The purpose of   name   is             Public stuff     return          name ,         purpose ,         setInfo functionname, purpose              this.name  name             this.purpose  purpose         ,         showInfo function              alertgetInfo               undefined  Example.setInfosomeModule, Showing some stuff. Example.showInfo codepre  pNon working Example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLy66mcxo relnofollowFiddleap  pNow the module itself is encapsulated inside the codeExamplecode namespace amp there is something like public amp private members, but working with it is quite different amp difficult to me, probably because I cant wrap my head around the fact that there is no instance created using the codenewcode keyword.p  pIn the non working example, why does it alert coderesultcode although that string is never set amp why is codepurposecode not alerted I think the codesetInfocode method itself works, so its probably a scope issue I dont understand.p  pAlso, is there a way around using gettersetter functions To me it currently looks like assignments I would normally do in the constructor arent really possible using the module patternp  precodefunction Examplename, purpose      this.name  name     this. purpose  purpose  codepre  pUsing the module pattern, I either have to user gettersetter emorem something like a universal setter function in form of an init function. p  pComing from PHP OOP, I always try to avoid them as much as possible, but I dont really know how to handle that in a prototype based language.p  pMaybe there is something similar to the module pattern, but with using prototypes  something like module amp constructor pattern It might be easier for me to understand.p

Negative 1372 pCurrently, I am working on a project of implementing a Neo4j V2.2.0 database in the field of webanalytics. After loading some samples, Im trying to load a big data set 1GB, 4M lines. The problem I am facing, is that the usage of the MERGE command takes exponentially more time as the data size grows. Online sources are ambiguous on what the best way is to load big sets of data when not every line has to be loaded as a node, and I would like some clarity on the subject. To emphasize, in this situation I am just loading the nodes relations are the next step.p  pBasically there are three methodsp  pi Set a uniqueness constraint for a property, and create all nodes. This method was used mainly before the MERGE command was introduced.p  precodeCREATE CONSTRAINT ON bookBook ASSERT book.isbn IS UNIQUE codepre  pfollowed byp  precodeUSING PERIODIC COMMIT 250 LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM fileCpathfile.tsv AS row FIELDTERMINATORt CREATE Bookisbnrow.isbn, titlerow.title, etc codepre  pIn my experience, this will return a error if a duplicate is found, which stops the query.p  pii Merging the nodes with all their properties.p  precodeUSING PERIODIC COMMIT 250 LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM fileCpathfile.tsv AS row FIELDTERMINATORt MERGE Bookisbnrow.isbn, titlerow.title, etc codepre  pI have tried loading my set in this manner, but after letting the process run for over 36 hours and coming to a grinding halt, I figured there should be a better alternative, as 200K of my eventual 750K nodes were loaded.p  piii Merging nodes based on one property, and setting the rest after that.p  precodeUSING PERIODIC COMMIT 250 LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM fileCpathfile.tsv AS row FIELDTERMINATORt MERGE bBookisbnrow.isbn ON CREATE SET b.title  row.title ON CREATE SET b.author  row.author etc codepre  pI am running a test now 20K nodes to see if switching from method ii to iii will improve execution time, as a smaller sample gave conflicting results.

Negative 1372 pIs there some way to properly dispose of a Windows inclinometer sensor in C I create the sensor with Inclinometer.GetDefault and then add a ReadingChanged event handler. The sensor works as expected, but I need to be able to dispose of the sensor after Im done. Currently, I remove the event handler and set the reference to null so the garbage collector can do its thing. However, performance analysis in Visual Studio is claiming that processing power is still being used by code in the Windows.Devices.Sensors namespace.p  pThe sensors are being used in a Windows service server and if no clients are connected it needs to sit idle and using the smallest amount of CPU possible. But when I pick the computer up and move it around, the disposed sensor starts consuming cpu cycles and causes the service to increase to about 0.5 to 1.0 CPU usage in Task Manager.p  pIs there some way that I can completely clean up the Windows sensorp

Negative 1372 pIve written a skeleton Chrome extension for a Library kiosk environment. The purpose of the extension is to clear all browsing data and restart Chrome after X seconds of inactivity. I was inspired by the Idle Reset extension on the Chrome web store, but this doesnt provide all features Id like. Ideally I would like to mimic Prestobased Operas inactivity reset, present in kiosk mode, where a dialogue window with a countdown is displayed, i.e.p  pcodeInactivity resetcodep  pcodeThe browser will be reset and all browsing data removed in 60...1 secondscodep  pBut I think thats maybe a bit too complicated and Im not sure whether the codechrome.notificationcode API supports dynamic content such as countdown timers.p  pSo far I have come up with some code that displays a chrome notification after 1 minute of inactivity. The notification informs the user the browser will be reset in 30 seconds unless activity is resumed. The notification then closes itself. After a further 30 seconds of inactivity, the browsing data is cleared, any existing tabs removed and a new tab opened. I am using the codechrome.alarmscode API and lowering the codechrome.idle.setDetectionIntervalcode after the first idle event. If the user resumes activity the alarms and notifications are cleared, and codechrome.idle.setDetectionIntervalcode is restored to the default value of 60 seconds. p  pHere is my codeevent.jscode codep  precodechrome.idle.onStateChanged.addListenerfunction newState      if newState  idle              var opt                 type basic,               title Web Browser about to be reset,               message Web browser has been inactive for 1 minute.

I tried to search the internet for a solution, only to discover the cause which I already know.p  pIn my case im having a MVC5 project referencing a third partys DLL which consumes a c DLL, and 2 other text configuration files, apparently these files has to reside in the same folder with the third partys DLL. after compiling all the necessary files the 3rd partys DLL and all of its dependencies are then correctly copied to the bin folder.

For example...p  pFirst Table strongCuststrongp  precodeCustomerID    Name             School  1623          Bob Smith        BON 1785          Betty Davis      FOOT 1854          John Miller      BECK 1547          Kate Lake        BON codepre  pSecond Table strongYbkstrongp  precodeCustomerID      Frame     Type  1623            001       CC 1854            012       CC codepre  pWhat I would like to get from these two tables is a bit variable between two things...p  p1 If I want to select the School from the first table For example WHERE Cust.SchoolBON I would like to get this result backp  precodeCustomerID    Name             School      Frame     Type  1623          Bob Smith        BON         001       CC 1547          Kate Lake        BON          codepre  p2 Or, if I select everything, I get this result backp  precodeCustomerID    Name             School      Frame     Type  1623          Bob Smith        BON         001       CC  1785          Betty Davis      FOOT 1854          John Miller      BECK        012       CC 1547          Kate Lake        BON codepre  pRight now, when I try some different versions of the SELECT statement I only get back results that are in both tables instead all of the Cust fields returning with the Ybk ones if they exist as well.

I need a tool that allows me put these wireframes in the mockup, describe clickable button areas in them and then open a new wireframe from it and repeat.p  pWhy  I recently interviewed for a [almost] major US based tech firm for a design position with their VP of Engineering. The guy gave me a project to show my skills and asked that he would love to see my wireframes in action on a real device which shows transitions and that there are tons of softwares out there that allows this without coding.p  pI have created apps before using Android Studio but, to breakup each of my wireframes and describe them in layout will be really hectic now. Are there really any tools to do that because Ive spent hours finding a good one. Should I go the long way p

The previous version, the one currently in production, is 1.10.2391.p  pWhy should the the Info.plist file have a number HIGHER than the actual new build number which is 1.12.2411 as shown just below the error message in itunes connect.p  pWe havent yet used testflight since Apple took control of it.p

The stranger thing is all codeerrnocode are 0, and when I use a g compiler in Linux to compile the same program, the program can read all not just 10 of the records in the same file without any problem.p  pIs there anything I have missed Thanksp

The userRecord is what the query returned.  if i console.log this out it shows the properties related to the model itself but not the associated records, even though the key is actually there, you can access it but is not visible to console.log or utils.inspec even when setting show hidden to true.p  precodeconsole.loguserRecord codepre  pThis is what gets returnedp  precode name zaggen codepre  pThis is what should get returnedp  precode name zaggen,   images [      path somepathimg.png   ]    codepre  pAnd i can access the hidden property like thisp  precodeconsole.loguserRecord.images[0].path   outputs somepathimg.png codepre  pHow is this even possible, as far as i know there is no way to hide info to the console.log in node, except maybe when the properties are defined in the codeprotocode object, but in this case they are not.p  pAfter searching for this i havent found anything and its pretty weird so i thought it could be a good question for SO. Itll help on my work process if i could console.log this info and get all the data, right now i can use lodash and call clone or defaults and i get the object as it should.p

Also, if a breakpoint is introduced on the codewaitForExpectationsWithTimeout...code line, the test succeedssimilarly, the test succeeds when an artificial sleep delay is introduced.

My call looks something like thisp  precodevar request  new RestRequestfoo, Method.POST request.JsonSerializer.ContentType  applicationjson charsetutf8 request.AddJsonBodynew string[]  param1, param2  var response  this.client.ExecuteltFoogtrequest codepre  pFor most other calls this works fine. Im running into issues when the response is compressed. The headers in the response look mostly like thisp  precodeHTTP1.1 200 OK UncompressedSize 35000 ContentLength 3019 ContentEncoding deflate ContentType applicationjson codepre  pThe issue is when I call this method with RestSharp I keep getting the errorp  blockquote   pError Block length does not match with its complement.p blockquote  pIve tried setting the codeAcceptEncodingcode header in the request but it still produces the error. I also tried using a custom deserializer but the error is occurring before deserialization. From what I can tell, RestSharp should automatically handle deflation if the codeContentEncodingcode header says codedeflatecode which it does.p  pHow can I get RestSharp to handle the deflation properlyp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIn the end I was able to have the service changed to look for an codeAcceptEncodingcode header in the request with a value of codeidentitycode. If found, the service was changed to return the data uncompressed.p  pThis is unfortunately not really a solution to the original issue but it does resolve the problem for me. If a better solution is posted I will try it.p

Negative 1372 pSay I have this loopp  precodefor i0 i lt 100 i      srandtimeNULL     printfdn, rand  codepre  pIf my machine is reasonably fast, it should print the same number 100 times.p  pBut if I modify it like thisp  precodefor i0 i lt 100 i      srandtimeNULL  rand     printfdn, rand  codepre  pThen it should print 100 different numbers. My question is, is there anything wrong in seeding the randomizer like this What about efficiency Does it significantly reduce the efficiencyp  pA side question, if I seed the randomizer in the codemaincode function once, is it enough for other functions as well i.e. I do not need to seed it again in another function which uses coderandcodep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThere is a reason why I may need to use this way unless of course there is a better way which I dont know. Say I have a custom library with a function that uses coderandcode. But that function does not know whether randomizer was seeded before or not. In that case, I put codesrandtimeNULL  randcode in that function to make sure that the randomizer is seeded even if it was not seeded before.p  pExamplep  precodeint main      int i      srandtimeNULL   Seeded here, but the printrand function does not know it      for i0 i lt 100 i              printrand           return0     Pretend this function is in a library void printrand      srandtimeNULL  rand  No guarantee if seeding was done before, so doing it here      printfdn, rand  codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI just tested it with 1000000 loops. Seeding once took code0.024scode and seeding every time took code4.972scode. So I guess it does add up to significant performance decrease if it is a large loop.p

Negative 1372 pI have an interesting problem that has arisen due to some newly formatted and poorly structured data files.  They are text files, comma delimited, that contain multiple sets of data each with a unique header. Originally I was using genFromTxt to read in only one instance of data with one header. Now with the multiple instances, genFromTxt just cant handle it. What would be the best way to approach splitting the file up and feeding each individual instance into genFromTxt Here is an example of the file.  Data from the first instance immediately butts up to the header of the second instance. This repeats around 20 times per file. I have not found a common delimiter to be able to separate them yet. p  precode       0.8 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.0 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.000 999.000 999.0 999.0 99999.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0        0.5 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.0 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0   72.380  7.761 999.0 999.0 99999.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0        0.3 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.0 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.000 999.000 999.0 999.0 99999.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0        0.0 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.0 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0   72.381  7.760 999.0 999.0 99999.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0  9.0       1.0  906.7  20.0  18.9  92.8  10.1   3.7  10.7  70.0 999.0   72.380  7.761 999.0 999.0   953.8  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  9.0     Data Type                         AVAPS SOUNDING DATA, Channel 2Descending     Project ID                        DYNAMO     Release Site TypeSite ID         NOAA P3N43RF 20111116I1     Release Location lon,lat,alt    072 12.04E, 08 11.50S, 72.201, 8.192, 966.4     UTC Release Time y,m,d,h,m,s    2011, 11, 16, 042207     Reference Launch Data SourceTime IWGADTS Format IWG1042207     Sonde Id                          110355308     System OperatorComments          TMRnone, Good Drop     Post Processing Comments          Aspen Version 3.1 Created on 01 Feb 2012 2318 UTC Configuration researchdropsonde               Nominal Release Time y,m,d,h,m,s2011, 11, 16, 042207      Time  Press  Temp  Dewpt  RH    Ucmp   Vcmp   spd   dir   Wcmp     Lon     Lat   Ele   Azi    Alt    Qp   Qt   Qrh  Qu   Qv   QdZ       sec    mb     C     C          ms    ms   ms   deg   ms      deg     deg   deg   deg     m    code code code code code code                                89.8 1011.6  27.3  23.9  81.0 9999.0 9999.0 999.0 999.0 999.0 9999.000 999.000 999.0 999.0     0.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  9.0  9.0  9.0 codepre
