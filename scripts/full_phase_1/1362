Positive 1362 pIve spent several days looking at elegant solutions proposed by Noseratio for working with the WebBrowser control for developing a web automation tool.  The posts have been extremely helpful, to say the leastp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22239357howtocanceltaskawaitafteratimeoutperiod2226297622262976How to cancel Task await after a timeout periodap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19044659csharpwebbrowsercontrolformsubmitnotworkingusinginvokememberclick1906364319063643C WebBrowser Control  Form Submit Not Working using InvokeMemberquotClickquotap  pThat being said, I have a problem that I run into that when using the NavigateAsync that I hope to solve just as elegantly.  Essentially, I use NavigateAsync to perform all of the navigation during the automation.  There is one call, however, that if successful, will transition the page to another, which will cause the DocumentCompleted event to fire.  On other iterations, however, it may and does fail, causing a string to be updated by javascript.  When this happens, naturally, the DocumentCompleted event is never fired, so the program waits indefinitely for the TaskCompletionSource to be completed.  It seems to me there are potentially several ways to solve thisp  pSet a timeout.  Im not usually fond of setting arbitrary timeouts, because inevitably it will take longer at some point   And while this may not be an issue, I would only want to cancel this particular step of the workflow, and not affect the CancellationToken that was passed into NavigateAsync.  This will allow me to simply not transition the state machine, at which point it will try this step again.p  pAttach an event to the HtmlElement that refreshes via JS, and if that updates, complete the TaskCompletionSource and let it unhook all of the event handlers, including the DocumentCompleted.  Id have to add a parameter to NavigateAsync for the HtmlElement so that I can properly attach and detach event handlers in sync with the DocumentCompleted event, although Im not sure yet if I would be adding new problems.p  pIm sure there are other solutions as well.  Ill gladly share code samples, although the NavigateAsync in question I believe to be fairly identical to Noseratios, and where I believe the issue has to be solved p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Positive 1362 pI have an automation framework that uses a grunt task to run multiple spec files. Some are run using a predefined suite, others using file naming conventions.

The MVP would be just the failed spec file names in a list or written to a file in an easy to read format xml, html, etc.. Next iteration I would have the describe and it block descriptions, error codes, and saucelabs link next to each failure similar the jasmine reporter.p  pI normally have hundreds of spec files in a single job, and having to comb through all the individual results just to track down which spec file failed is quite annoying since I feel an automatically generated summary should have that information. Im literally having to do a ctrlf on the console output for failures, just to see which specs have failed. I want to avoid going to saucelabs for the failure list, because of how our job runs are organized through Jenkins. The console output should be an easy first sourcereference for a list of failures once a job is done running.p  pEvery third party reporters scope seems to only go up to the spec file level. After each spec file is executed, it reports, then goes on to the next one which overrides the previous report. I open the HTML or XML report, and it always has just one spec files results. I cant seem to carry any information into a summary for multiple spec files. Ive tweaked the consolidateAll settings, and none seem to build a report for all spec files. They seem to only consider a single file at a time.p  pI have experimented with the following reportersp  pjasminereportersp  pjasminespecreporterp  pprotractorjasmine2htmlreporterp  pjasminejsontestreporterp  pIve been able to manipulate the Protractor reportSummary code directly to give me most of what I want except for the saucelabs link, but this isnt ideal since Id have to convince them to adopt it. Heres what my summary looks likep  precode    FAILED SPECS       PlaygroundTestSpec2.js failed 2 tests      can log in once         FAILURE Expected false to be true, Didnt see home page.

Negative 1362 pI am implementing a Microsoft Speech Server application built on windows workflow foundation. The app manages other sub apps  users call in and the manager loads the assembly containing the correct application and invokes the workflow.p  pThe problem Im facing is that speech serve or iis like to lock the assembly into memory, preventing me from overwriting the dll. This makes it a pain to debug the app, but will also be totally unacceptable once the app is deployed to production.p  pThere is no way to manually unload a single specific assembly  assemblies are only unloaded when their parent application domain unloads.p  pSo I am trying to use .net remoting to create a new application domain, load the assembly into that domain, create the workflow object through a proxy, and then I want to pass that proxy around.p  pThis is the code for the type that I am trying to create.

Negative 1362 pIm reverse engineering the relationships between a mediumsized number of tables 50 in an Oracle database where there are no foreign keys defined between the tables.  I can count somewhat on being able to match column names across tables.  For example, column name SomeDescriptiveName is probably the same across the set of tables.  p  pWhat I would like to be able to do is to find a better way of extracting some set of relationships based on those matching column names than manually going through the tables one by one.  I could do something with Java DatabaseMetaData methods but it seems like this is one of those tasks that someone has probably had to script before.  Maybe extract the columns names with Perl or some other scripting lang, use the column names as a hash key and add tables to an array pointed to by the hash keyp  pAnyone have any tips or suggestions that might make this simpler or provide a good starting point  Its an ugly need, if foreign keys had already been defined, understanding the relationships would have been much easier.p  pThanks.  p

Negative 1362 pIve got data in the registry under Current User which I want to add into predefined bookmarks in Word documents.

Negative 1362 pI have a couple questions about Sutters concurrency series on Dr. Dobbs.p  p1 Sutter recommends moving code not requiring locks out of critical sections to apart from increase the granularity of the critical section keep from nesting critical sections, in the event that the nested calls themselves enter critical sections. I have always done this but as he points out in Use Critical Sections Preferably Locks to Eliminate Races the compiler can move code INTO a critical section. Is this then a reliable way to enforce lock hierarchies and keep from nesting critical sections which can lead to deadblocksp  p2 In Maximize Locality, Minimize Contention, Sutter gives examples and makes recommendations about how to organize data to increase concurrency using knowledge of the hardware e.g. cache size and exclusivity to a core or set of cores, etc.. One suggestion he makes is to add a dummy member to a class separating two contentious members to force them to go into separate cache lines on separate cores, allowing concurrent work on the members. How the heck do I do this Given the power that the compiler, processor and cache have over my code, how do I know if this hardware level design works How do I convince someone looking at my code that it works It seems like black magic to me. So one of two things is true1 this article is blue sky software development, or 2 I am missing out on some very cool knowledge and tricks. I suspect the latter. Can someone please tell me howwhere to get started correctly designing concurrent code given hardware knowledge or at least point me somewhere to start learningp  pMany thanksp

Negative 1362 pMy application uses NHibernate with a session per request implementation.  I have a core library that provides a thread safe singleton for getting access to the current nhibernate session.  p  pThat singleton is leveraged from the web application in the BeginRequest and EndRequest events to ensure the opening and closing of the session with each request. Additionally, my DataAccess layer uses the same singleton to perform data access, so that the same nhibernate session is leveraged.p  pIve now added Ninject into the equation so that I can infer at runtime, the NHibernate contextual information, namely, the connection string.  Id like to change a value in my web config that tells it which database it will hit.  The problem is, in order to do this, I need my singleton mentioned above to be able to infer one of its properties, IConnectionStringProvider.  p  pIts wired up correctly, but the singleton will never have instantiated properties, hence, everything breaks.p  pSo, to my question...how can I get Ninject to work with a singleton, or how can I change my implementation to work with Ninjectp

Negative 1362 pOne definition of binding is that it is the act of replacing function names with memory addresses.p  pa Thus I assume early binding means function calls are replaced with memory addresses during compilation process, while with late binding this replacement happens during runtime  p  pb Why are virtual methods also considered early bound thus the target method is found at compile time, and code is created that will call this method As far as I know, with virtual methods the call to actual method is resolved only during runtime and not compile time p  pthanxp  pbrp  pEDITp  p1  p  precodeA anew A a.M codepre  pAs far as I know, it is not known at compile time where on the heap thus at which memory address  will instance codeacode be created during runtime.  Now, with early binding the function calls are replaced with memory addresses during compilation process. But how can compiler replace function call with memory address, if it doesnt know where on the heap will object codeacode be created during runtime  here Im assuming the address of method codea.Mcode will also be at same memory location as codeacode  p  p2p  blockquote   pvtable calls are neither early nor late bound. Instead theres an offset into a table of function pointers. The offset is fixed at compile time, but which table the function pointer is chosen from depends on the runtime type of the object the object contains a hidden pointer to its vtable, so the final function address is found at runtime.p blockquote  pBut assuming the object of type codeTcode is created via reflection  thus app doesnt even know of existence of type codeTcode , then how can at compile time exist an entry point for that type of object  p

Negative 1362 pTitle more or less says it all.  In response to a codetouchesBegancode event, my codeUIViewControllercode recolours itself and adds some subviews. p  pIt never receives the codetouchesEndedcode.

The fact that the touch originated on a subview which no longer existed meant that the rest of the touch was lost.p  pI fixed this by overriding hitTestwithEvent in my master view, to stop touches ever getting tested against the subviewsp

Negative 1362 pIn the CLR the runtime used by C, VB.NET, etc. theres a way of registering a callback to be called when an unhandled exception is thrown.p  pIs there anything similar in Javap  pIm guessing it would presumably be some API to which youd pass an object that implements some interface with a single method. When an exception is thrown and there is no matching codecatchcode on the stack, the runtime would call the method on the registered object, and would be passed the exception object.p  pThis would allow the programmer to save the stack trace. It would also allow them to call codeSystem.exitcode, to stop codefinallycode blocks executing only for unhandled exceptions.p  pstrongUpdate 1.strongp  pTo illustrate this, here is a sample in Cp  precode register custom handler for unhandled exceptions AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException  sender, evt gt      Console.WriteLineunhandled exception     Environment.FailFastnull   try      throw new NullReferenceException  finally      Console.WriteLinefinally is executing  codepre  pThe point is that by putting in the call to codeEnvironment.FailFastnullcode I can stop the codefinallycode block from executing.p  pSure enough, in NET 3.5 and 4.0 running on Windows 7, I dont see the finally is executing string in the output. But if I comment out the codeFailFastcode call, then I do see that string in the output.p  pstrongUpdate 2.strongp  pBased on the answers so far, heres my attempt to reproduce this in Java.p  precode register custom handler for unhandled exceptions Thread.currentThread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler      new Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler           public void uncaughtException                 final Thread t, final Throwable e               System.out.printlnUncaught exception             System.exit0                 try      throw new NullPointerException  finally      System.out.printlnfinally is executing  codepre  pWhen I run that in Java 6 1.6.018 I seep  ul lifinally is executingli liuncaught exceptionli ul  pIn other words, the JRE executes codefinallycode blocks before executing the uncaughtexception handler.p  pFor some background on why this is important, heres a more complex examplep  precodetry      try              throw new NullPointerException          finally              System.out.printlnfinally is executing         throw new java.io.IOException       catch java.io.IOException x      System.out.printlncaught IOException   System.out.printlnprogram keeps running as if nothing had happened... codepre  pSo theres a serious bug and I want my program to halt and log the stack trace. But before I can do this, theres an intermediate codefinallycode block somewhere on the stack in a real program it would be in a separate method and it tries to access the file system. Something goes wrong. Then a little further up the stack suppose I have a catch for codeIOExceptioncode because theyre not a big deal to me.p  pNeedless to say, the output isp  ul lifinally is executingli licaught IOExceptionli liprogram keeps running as if nothing had happened...li ul  pSo now I have by accident created a situation in which serious bugs are hidden from me.p  pThere are two solutionsp  ul lisomehow ensure that codefinallycode blocks emneverem throw, because they cant locally tell if it is safe to. This is a shame because it is perfectly okay for them to throw on the normal execution path, i.e. when they are not running in response to a previous exception.li litell the runtime that I dont want it to run codefinallycode blocks when theres an uncaught exception.li ul  pThe latter is certainly my preference if its available.p

Using Fiddler, after 2 minutes had elapsed, I could see that the raw value of the role cookie had changed. p  pI was expecting that on expiry, that ASP.NET would simply reread the roles information from the database, and repopulate the cookie with the same value.

Im familiar with UTF8 where it represents characters above 127 by using two bytes but if this was UTF8 encoding then I would expect the 32 value to be more like 194 0xC2 or 0xC3 and the other value would be greater than 0x80.p  pUltimately what Im trying to do is convert this signature parameter into a hex encoded string eg. 12ab0528... which is then used by the RSASHA1 function to verify the message is intact. This part is already working but I cant for the life of me figure out how to get the signature parameter decoded.p  pFor historical reasons we are having to use classic ASP and the SHA1RSA functions are javascript based.p  pAny help would be much appreciated. Regards, Craig.p  pUpdate Tried looking into UTF16 encoding on Wikipedia and other sites. Cant find anything to explain why I am seeing only 0x20 or 0x00 in the assumed high order byte positions.

Windows system updates is another example. I want to know how the user reacted to these alertsnotificationsupdates which are typically a popup window. So i was wondering if i placed a global hook that can monitor the content of the windows displayed on screen and notify meserver when certain words like update, alert, warning etc. appear in the contenttitle of the windows and what the user did with the messagedismissed it, Oked it etc. Unfortunately, i do not have any more specifications than this. I can use anything I want to achieve this and I am not clear on what my choices are. p  pstrongEdit 2strong p  pAfter having reviewed my requirements and having read about hooks, I feel like I could achieve this by a combination of hooks and the following textGrab SDK,  a hrefhttpwww.renovationsoftware.comentextgrabsdktextgrabsdk.html relnofollowhttpwww.renovationsoftware.comentextgrabsdktextgrabsdk.htmla. I want some guidance to know if I am on the right track. I am thinking if I can install hooks then it gives me handles to all possible windows on the screen and I can use the textGRAB SDK to look for certain keywords in those windows. Although this may capture some interesting text, I am still not sure how I will know what action the user had taken on the window. Anybody having any experience with either hooks or textGRAB, please let me know if this looks like a reasonable thing to do. If the community has some other Ideas on how I could possibly monitor security related messages thrown by any application in the system, please suggest.

Negative 1362 pI am supervising a project done by two students that involves retrieving information from a server and displaying it on an android phone. The students have never learnt networking, sql or java before although they do know how to program and are only now learning how to setup socketed connections between the phone and a sample server app that i gave them. p  pThey will need to setup a simple sql database on the server on the campus network and be able to communicate with it and only pull information from the database and display it on the phone.p  pMy current plan is that they will receive xml objects generated on the server side sent as a stream through the socket connection. They will then be able to generate a DOM using javax.xml classes and display it as they see fit on the phone itself. p  pIs this a valid method What kind of problems can they expect to experience by following this technique Is there anotherbettercorrect way to do this strongwithout using php or webservicesstrong The system will be for multiple users so will there be any significant performance issue with the proposed methodp  pNote 1 The phone never sends any request other than a single multicharacter identifier. The server interprets this identifier and returns information from preprogrammed queries and places it into an xml format. p

Negative 1362 pI am using NPOI 1.2.3.0 in an ASP.NET application to export the results of a rather large SQL query to an Excel 2003 XLS file.p  pIn short, the query results are populated into an ADO.NET DataTable. I then have a routine that loops through the rows in the DataTable and for each row adds a row to an NPOI spreadsheet. It is intelligent enough that once 65,000 rows are exceeded for a single sheet, a new sheet is created and the rows are continued there, starting at the first row in the new sheet.p  pThis approach works well for some of my smaller database queries that include, say, 30,000 rows and 50 columns, but I have this one query that returns north of 125,000 rows and has roughly 50 columns, many of which have a good deal of text.p  pI am able to construct the spreadsheet without issue, but when I try to stream the generated spreadsheet down to the browser I get an codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncode when calling the codeHSSFWorkbookcode classs codeWritecode method. Internally, the error is happening when the Write method calls the classs codeGetBytescode method.p  pIf I run the debugger and stop before the Write method is called, I see that the workbooks Size property returns a value of roughly 65 million.p  pThis error is noted on the NPOI project at CodePlex  see the discussion titled a hrefhttpnpoi.codeplex.comdiscussions204489 relnofollowOut of Memory Problemsa  but no resolution was found, unfortunately.p  pFor completeness, here is the code where the exception is raised specifically, its raised on the codeworkbook.Writecode line.    p  precodeUsing exportData As New MemoryStream     workbook.WriteexportData      Response.ContentType  applicationvnd.msexcel     Response.AddHeaderContentDisposition, AttachmentFilename amp saveAsName     Response.Clear     Response.BinaryWriteexportData.GetBuffer     Response.End End Using codepre  pThanksp

Negative 1362 pThe gist of itp  pIm creating an effect using jQuery where a succession of divs show up, and each div animates the typing of some text  which is really just me resetting the jQuery .html value to a text substring of incrementally increasing length very many times using Javascripts setTimeout.p  pEvery once in a while the typing animation stalls partway through the text, and just hangs there until the text theoretically would have finished typing  at which point it shows the full text.  The stalls occur consistently in the same places in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and on different computers.  The WEIRD part is that although I can see it stalling, while debugging I can still see the div text typing correctly in the DOM tree.p  pI also allow the user to click to skip to the next div.  The stalling issue only occurs after Ive fired this click callback.p  pAnyone got any idea  Im pretty stumped here.  Unfortunately I cant post any code, but I can give pseudocode if that would help.p

Negative 1362 pIm having a problem with the conversion to Excel code Im finding. I am working on a website project in .NET 4.0, and I have created a class for this that does the following based on a hrefhttpmattberseth.comblog200704exportgridviewtoexcel1.html relnofollowhttpmattberseth.comblog200704exportgridviewtoexcel1.htmlap  precodeHttpContext.Current.Response.Clear HttpContext.Current.Response.AddHeadercontentdisposition, string.Formatattachment filename0, fileName HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType  applicationmsexcel using StringWriter sw  new StringWriter     using HtmlTextWriter htw  new HtmlTextWritersw      Create a table to contain the grid     Add header row     Add each data row     Add Footer row     Render the table into the htmlwriter       render the htmlwriter into the response     HttpContext.Current.Response.Writesw.ToString     HttpContext.Current.Response.End     codepre  pI call this class from a usercontrol that contains a button that is added to a GridView displayed on the page. This works as expected  click the button, you are presented with a download option to either open or save the resulting excel spreadsheet containing the data from the GridView.p  pHowever, when I call this from a linkbutton inside a different GridView, Id like to build a dynamic gridview to contain data and export that. When I do that, I get a ThreadAbortException from the Response.End call in the class.p  pQuestion 1 Why do I not get that ThreadAbortException when calling the same code from within a usercontrol Do usercontrols get their own threads or some other kind of contextp  pSearching on the error I get when that ThreadAbortException occurs led me to attempt to replace it with ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest. When I do that I no longer get the ThreadAbortException, but this breaks the previously working usercontrol  instead of the resulting excel spreadsheet containing the data from the grid, it contains the HTML from the containing page, and at any rate its easy enough to suppress that error with an empty catch. However, it doesnt fix the direct call with the dynamically generated GridView, that code renders a javascript error The message received from the server could not be parsed.p  pI would love to understand what exactly is going on here, but Im at the point of needing results regardless of understanding. All the other approaches Ive tried datagrid instead of GridView, etc run into the same problems, and are essentially the same when it comes down to taking over the current response and using stringwriter and htmlwriter to render the data into a response with excel contentType. And since this demonstrably works in the context of a usercontrol, I am at my wits end as to why it wont work when called directly...p

I guess this may not   be an issue in production no doubt   there will be plenty of other issues   but I emwouldem like to know if I am   using the right code for the job here.p      pLooking around I saw that python also   provides a socketserver library    a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarysocketserver.htmlhttpdocs.python.orglibrarysocketserver.htmlap      pThe emsocketem library provides the   ability to listen for multiple   connections, typically up to 5.p      pAccording to the emsocketserverem page,   its services are synchronous, i.e.   blocking, but one may support   asynchronous behavior via threading.    I did notice it has the ability to   maintain a request queue, with a   default value of up to 5 requests...so   maybe not much difference there.p      pI have also read that Twisted runs   socketserver under the hood.  Though I   would rather not get into a beast the   size of Twisted unless its going to   be worthwhile.p      pso my question is, strongis socketserver   more robust than socketstrong If so, whyp      pAnd how do you know  p      pincidentally, is socketserver built on   top of pythons socket or is it   entirely separate  p      pfinally, as a bonus if anyone knows   what one could do wrong such that   standard sockets fall asleep please   feel free to chime in on that too.p      pOh, and Im talking python 2.x rather   than 3.x here if that makes a   difference.p      pthanks folks p      pjshp blockquote  hr  pWell, I dont have a technical answer but Ive implemented SocketServer per folks recommendations and it IS definitely more reliable.

Negative 1362 pA coworker and I were brainstorming on how to mitigate the memory transfer time between host and device and it came up that perhaps arranging things to one megatransfer i.e. one single call might help.

A sample of my output is thisp  blockquote   psingle large transfer    0.451616 msbr   10 explicit transfers    0.198016 msbr   100 explicit transfers   0.691712 msbr   10 looped transfers      0.174848 msbr   100 looped transfers     0.683744 msbr   1000 looped transfers    6.145792 msbr   10000 looped transfers   104.981247 msbr   100000 looped transfers  13097.441406 ms  p blockquote  pWhats interesting here and what I dont get is that, across the board, the 10 transfers were ALWAYS faster by a significant amount than any of the others, even the single large transfer And that result stayed consistent no matter how large or small the data set was i.e. 10x100MB vs 1x1GB or 10x1MB vs 1x10MB still results in the 10x being faster. If anyone has any insight on why this is or what I may be doing wrong to get these weird numbers, I would be very interested to hear what you have to say.p  pThanksp  pP.S. I know that cudaMemcpy carries with it an implicit synchronization and so I could have used a CPU timer and that cudaEventSynchronize is redundant, but I figured it was better to be on the safe sidep  pUPDATE I wrote a function to try and take advantage of this apparent rip in the performance spacetime continuum. When I use that function, though, which is written EXACLTY as in my test cases, the effect goes away and I see what I expect a single cudaMemcpy is fastest. Perhaps this is all more akin to quantum physics than relativity wherein the act of observing changes the behavior...p
Negative 1362 pIm wondering what to do in the case of a customer asking for a second layer of encryption on top of SSLp  pFor example, I have an SSL tunnel, and the customer wants me to then use symmetric key encryption on data flowing through that tunnel.  The symmetric key is sessionbased and sent from the server to the client over the original SSL tunnel.p  pI am failing to see how this is more secure.  If the SSL tunnel is compromised, then in theory, so is the symmetric key that is sent from the server to do the symmetric encryption during the session.p  pCan anyone offer any different viewpoints on this situation  Im sure that if there was a shared secret established beforehand like a onetime password, that this would make things more secure, but since the secret is being passed across the session over SSL, I dont see how its buying us any extra security.p  pWhat are your thoughts, and have you had any similar experiencep  pThank youp

Is the other supposed to represent the covariance of the measurement  How are these values expected to be insertedpli lipNormally, the Kalman Filter will not be expecting measurements on regular timeintervals.  Rather, I would expect that a time would accompany every reading indicating the actual time that it occurs.  In the examples given, a constant value called Period is used.  Moreover, none of the virtual functions in the EKFilter class can recieve any inputs.  How can one use time as an input corresponding to a new measurement  Similarly, the example given has constant R and Q matrices.  How can one use the covariance as an input corresponding to a readingpli ol

Negative 1362 pMy task is to track adding and deleting disk drives from windows service. I use RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx and RegisterDeviceNotification to implement this. My service control handler routine succefully receives SERVICECONTROLDEVICEEVENT control code and handles DBTDEVICEARRIVAL and DBTDEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE events for GUIDDEVINTERFACEVOLUME clsss. By the way windows does not send DBTDEVICEQUERYREMOVE, DBTDEVICEQUERYREMOVEFAILED, DBTDEVICEREMOVEPENDING events to my routine but now i want to solve another problem.p  pWhen i receive DBTDEVICEARRIVAL and DBTDEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE events and dbchdevicetype is DBTDEVTYPDEVICEINTERFACE i can read device name from dbccname field of DEVBROADCASTDEVICEINTERFACE structure. It looks like this STORAGERemovableMedia7amp331a4e33amp0ampRM53f5630db6bf11d094f200a0c91efb8bp  pI can convert this string to volume guid path using GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint procedure only on DBTDEVICEARRIVAL event. On DBTDEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE event GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint returns error 3 The system cannot find the path specified.p  pOn the other hand during service start i do scan for all volumes in the system with FindFirstVolumeFindNextVolume which returns to me list of volume GUID paths of all volumes.p  pSo if volume exists when my service starts i can receive its volume GUID path. And if that volume will be removed while my service is running then i will receive device name like STORAGERemovableMedia7amp331a4e33amp0ampRM53f5630db6bf11d094f200a0c91efb8b  from  DBTDEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE event.p  pAs i wrote above i can not use GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint during DBTDEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE event to get volume GUID path. So i would like to find a way to convert volume GUID path received from FindFirstVolumeFindNextVolume to device name. I need this to maintain my own list of present removable disk drives in the system.p  pPlease give me some advice on this problem.p

Negative 1362 pI am occasionally forced to use MSSQL, so my knowledge of it is basic. Im sure the following problem is piece of cake for an MSSQL expert, but for me this looks really like a nasty bugp  pSay I have a simple table containing a persons last name, first name, and email, like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE dbo.people  lastName varchar50 NULL, firstName varchar50 NULL, email varchar50 NULL  codepre  pNow Im going to create a view so I have some preconcated fields, like thisp  precodeCREATE VIEW vpeople AS SELECT     people.,     people.lastName     people.firstName AS concatName FROM people codepre  pNow I notice that I forgot the Phone number field, and alter the original table, but ONLY the table, NOT the viewp  precodeALTER TABLE dbo.people ADD phone varchar50 NULL codepre  pCool, also works. But what now happened to the view is quite horrible The view field concatName does not contain the concated names, but the Phone Numbers, even if the view fields are STILL the same amount and namesp  pIt seems that MSSQL is just moving the data columns within the view without updating the column definitions. Quite horrible scenario, if you forget to update views that depends on tables you alter...p  pDo I have overseen something, or am I really responsible for always checking  altering all the views if I just add a new table column Is there a way to let the MSSQL server at least throw a warning about depending viewsp  pI noticed that it does not happen if the view is constructed like thisp  precodeCREATE VIEW vpeople AS SELECT     people.lastName     people.firstName AS concatName,     people.

Negative 1362 pI am using a TimerTask to run some periodic tasks, the task being processing a set of files. I have a requirement where if the number of files to be processed exceeds a predetermined limit, the thread suspends execution and waits till the next cycle to start processing the files again. Is there a way to suspend the TimerTask until the next execution period or do I have to extend the TimerTask class to achieve this functionality I saw there is a TimerTask.cancel method, but this will cancel all further executions of this thread. I dont want this to happen. I just want the thread to be suspended until the next execution period.

Negative 1362 pIm seeing slightly dimmed coloralpha output from OpenGL in Linux.  Instead of seeing a red component value of 1.0 Im seeing .96988.  For example, I have a fully red rectangle red component  1.0, alpha  1.0, green and blue are zero.  This dimming happens whether I enable my vertexfragment shaders or not.p  pLighting is disabled so no ambient or other light should be included in the color calculation.p  precodeglBeginGLPOLYGON glColor4f1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 glVertex2f0.0, 0.0 glVertex2f1.0, 0.0 glVertex2f1.0, 1.0 glVertex2f0.0, 1.0 glEnd codepre  pI take a screenshot of the resulting window and then load the image into a paint program and examine any particular pixel.  I see a red component integer value of 247 instead of 255 as I would expect.  When I run this with the vertex shader enabled I see the glColor.r component is already lt 1.0 and the glColor.a component is as well.p  pAll OpenGL states are at the default values. What am I missingp  pEdit due to question I determined that the value of the red component was .96988 by a crude and iterative process of inspecting it in the vertex shader and altering the blue component to signal when the red component was above a threshold value. I kept reducing the constant threashold value until I no longer saw purple.  This did the trickp  precodeifglColor.r gt 0.96988      glColor.b  1.0   show purple instead of the slightly dimmed red.  codepre  pEditp  precodeVERTEX SHADER varying vec2 texturecoordinate void main     glPosition  ftransform    texturecoordinate  vec2glMultiTexCoord0    glFrontColor  glColor    FRAGMENT SHADER varying vec2 texturecoordinate uniform sampler2D Texture0 void mainvoid      glFragColor  texture2DTexture0, texturecoordinate  glColor  codepre  pTexture0 in this instance is a fully saturated RED rectangle Red  1.0, Alpha  1.0.  Without the texture, using vertex color, I get the same results a slightly dimminished Red and Alpha component.p  pOne more thing, the Red and Aplha channels are dimmed by the same amount. So something is causing a dimming of the entire color component.  And as I stated in the main question this occurs whether I use shaders or the fixed punction pipeline.p  pJust for fun I performed a similar test in Windows using DirectX and this resulted in a rectangle with a Red component of 254 still slightly dimmed but just barely.p

These are ports that dont show up in the sh vlan command on a routerlayer 3 switch.  Ideally, Id like to use the MAC addresses present in these ports, underlying the layer 3 connection, as thats a bit more permanent than the IP address  these do show up in the MACaddress table on the device.  However, the fact that these ports dont have an associated VLAN, and that the MAC retrieval via SNMP is VLANindexed, makes it quite difficult.p  pIve been banging my head against this for about a week or so, but nothing I tryfind seems to allow me to get the nonVLAN MAC addresses.  Is it possible to map the layer three ports this way, or will I need to use layer 3 IP address mappingp

Negative 1362 pI have a scenario where a class called Comment references an abstract type called Entity. The FluentClassMap looks quite similar to the following for the property Entityp  precodeclassMap.ReferencesAnyx gt x.Entity    .EntityTypeColumnDiscriminatorType    .EntityIdentifierColumnDiscriminatorId    .IdentityTypeltintgt    .AddMetaValuetypeofCar, typeofCar.Name    .AddMetaValuetypeofHouse, typeofHouse.Name codepre  pAs you might have already discovered from the example above the class Entity is subclassed by a class named House and a class called Car. With this setup it is rather trivial to retrieve all comments for a specifc Entity by simply doing something like the following Session.Query.Wherem  m.Entity  myCarObject.ToList. Everything works like a charm. p  pHere is the simplified class structurep  precodeabstract class Entity class Car  Entity class House  Entity  class Comment      public virtual Entity  get set  codepre  pHowever, in one use case I need to retrieve all instances of Comment that reference any Car. In other words Im trying to achieve something like the followingp  precodevar allCommentsOnCars1  Session.QueryltCommentgt.Wherem gt m.Entity is Car or var allCommentsOnCars2  Session.QueryltCommentgt.Wherem gt m.Entity.GetType  typeofCar codepre  pBoth examples are not working the latter throws a GetType is not implemented exception, but is it possible to solve this anyhow Very likely I could easily clear my problems by creating two seperate tables One for all the Cars comments as well as one for all the Houses comments, but I would rather not change the database structure nor the models at this moment.p  pYour feedback would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1362 pI want to develop a rather simple web application in Scala, with Lift or Play framework, using Eclipse as an environment and some simple webserver like Jetty. However, to my inexpressibly great surprise, I cannot setup the whole thing to work together. I also could not find any sensible simple and clear guide on how to do this. After a half day of searching, I came to an opinion that everyone around seem to use a mix of sbtmaven and feel it ok migrating from one to another and writing project config files manually just to get a simple blank project to begin with.p  pThere is no plain simple way to create even an empty project. With Java I remember that it was a couple of clicks  to integrate a webserver into Eclipse, create a simple web app project and run it right from there. Where had gone the power and simplicity of Scala in this case And thats only if I want to try Lift. What if I would like to try Play also, should I travel the same path againp  pIs there anywhere a simple and complete guide that describes how to setup the environment so that it is possible to start developing the apps right awayp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have reached a successful Play project integration with Eclipse, with all the capabilities that Play has outofthebox, thanks to the advice of Peter Gwiazda. I am using this setup for developing right now. However, my question of interest remains what are other ways to acheive similar functionality with other frameworks such as Lift, Scalatra and othersp

Negative 1362 pTrying to figure out the best way to do this And without crossing any specifics DO NOTs that I dont know about.p  pIm working on visually displaying a graph Various nodes, with edges connecting them with circles and lines to represent such.

Negative 1362 pIn my current project I am getting random crashes,may be due to memory overshoot.But I actually want to figure out which class lead to that crash.So I used symbolication method to find the reason of crash.  Here is what I have donep  pFirstly, XCode Build settings are like this p  pStrip Debug Sysbols During Copy  NO Deployment PostProcessing  YES Strip Linked Product  YES Generate Debug Symbols  YES Debug Info Format  DWARF with dSYM file Use Separate Strip  YESp  pI am using iOS 5.1 with 4.3.2 version of XCode. I have used symbolicatecrash and atos methods to reveal the reason of the crash.But I was not able to find the reason for the crash.p  pSo I tried this. I made the application crash by myself by accessing an out of bound index from the array. I have used that to verify the symbolicated crash result output with my actual crash.p  pHere is the crash report outputp  precodeIncident Identifier 93678EE5ED104502A59B5C7526640C4D CrashReporter Key

Negative 1362 pI want to setup a peer to peer connection between some computers, so users can chat and exchange files without an external Server. My first thoughts were as followsp  pI make a central ServerSocket on a server, where all applications can connect to. This ServerSocket keeps track of the connected sockets clients, and gives the IP and Port of a new connected client to all other clients. Each client creates a new ServerSocket to which all clients can connect to.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsSNqR.png altenter image description herep  pIn other words every client has a ServerSocket with all other clients connected to it. The messages should go via the blue lines in the images.p  pThere is just one little problem I run on if I test this via all different IP addresses, it works fine, but when two clients have the same external IPadress, it doesnt work any more. Does someone know a smart solution for thisp  pThanks Marcp

Negative 1362 pIn my Rails app, I have two custom Rake Tasks running every 30 minutes.  strongTask Astrong scrapes hourly prices from the internet and saves them to a database as HourlyPrice.  strongTask Bstrong goes into the db, takes hourly prices from each day for the last seven days, and averages them to create a new DailyAveragePrice record in a separate DB Table. p  pHowever, when running Task B, the last days of the seven average price is incorrect.p  pAfter fiddling with the hourly prices of that day in an Excel spreadsheet, I see that the average price Task B is generating is the result of taking only the emlast three hoursem and averaging them. p  pTask B is mostly done with this single queryp  precodeaverages  HourlyPrice.wheredate gt , 7.days.ago.averageprice, group gt DATETRUNCday, date  INTERVAL 1 hour codepre  pI cant figure out why this is happeningp  pstrongCluesstrongp  ol liHourlyPrice has two attributes datetime,price.  Each HourlyPrice actually represents a price for the previous hour.  So, source data lists a 240000 price for each day which PostgreSQL does not want to import as is into a datetime column.  Instead, it converts all 240000 prices to 000000 of the next day.  To make up for this, Ive tried to subtract an hour interval, as you can see in the query.  Is this causing the problemli liMy ActiveRecords time zone is currently set to Mountain Time US amp Canada.  That is where the price exchange is located.  I have not adjusted my PostgreSQL DBs timezone, and I believe it defaults to UTC.  When running Task B, I noticed that it was 920PM UTC, leaving three hours left in the UTC day, which might explain the averaging of only three HourlyPrices of the last of the seven days.  Ill try running Task B again in the next hour to see if it will average only two hours.  Update to come...  Is this timezone conflict causing a problem, or is what I am doing insulated from timezones since I have my own date columnsli ol  pstrongUPDATE  Problem identified, but how to fixstrong Clue 2 is correct.  It is a timezone issue.  I just ran Task B again an hour later, with 2 hours left until UTC day change, and it only averages two HourlyPrices now for the last of the seven days.  p  pHow can I fix my query above to average ONLY if there are 24 HourlyPrice records available  p

Negative 1362 pOrgmode from Emacs is awesome to scribble down project notes and also maintain a todo list where you can quickly move things around updown, indentation etc.. However, especially when it comes to images, the emacs is rather limited since its a texteditor. There are ways to include images, even copypasted images from the clipboard, but the results are rather unsatisfactory. For instance, an image in emacs is treated as a character, so if the images is higher than your screen there is no way to see the bottom of it. The existing workarounds for the scrolling problems are also not very satisfactory.p  pIs there any good alternative to emacs orgmode I checked through dozens of programs, but no other software that supports richtext would allow for fast, keyboardbased folding and moving of items.p

Negative 1362 pI have been designing an application which holds an expandable list. At the end of every list, an empty codeEditTextcode is ready to receive comments. I have the following problem when I touch the codeEditTextcode, the screen resizes slightly not a problem as the resizing does not always happen, depending on my layout and the position of the codeEditTextcode int he list and the softkeyboard appears. However, during these events, the codeEditTextcode looses focus and does not regain it. This is quite inconvenient as without focus, despite the keyboard being available, the input from the keyboard does not reach the codeEditTextcode. Once I touch it again, the codeEditTextcode behaves as expected.p  pIt gets even stranger. With the keyboard still displayed, I can touch a different codeEditTextcode and the same happens it looses focus. However, once I passed the initial loss of focus, I can move freely between previously touched codeEditTextcodes without any focus related issues. Only when I hide the softkeyboard will the state disappear and I would need to tap codeEditTextcodes twice before being able to edit them.p  pHere are excerpts from my code.

Negative 1362 h2EDIT  I really appreciate everyones input.  I gained something from all the responses and learned a good deal about OOD.h2  pI am making a simple virtual tabletop war game.  To represent units on the battlefield I have the following simple class hierarchy An abstract class Unit, and two derived classes, Troop and Vehicle.p  pI have another class that has a hashtable for all the units in the game.  The hashtable values are of Unit type, so I can reference them in O1 time.p  pFor the most part, this is fine, but sometimes the caller NEEDS to know if something is a troop or a vehicle to call specific methods from those derived classes. To accommodate for this, Ive created two get methods that will enforce the typesp  precode  public Troop getTroopString uniqueID      Unit potentialTroop  getuniqueID     ifpotentialTroop instanceof Vehicle        throw new InternalError          return Troop potentialTroop       public Vehicle getVehicleString uniqueID      Unit potentialVehicle  getuniqueID     ifpotentialVehicle instanceof Troop        throw new InternalError          return Vehicle potentialVehicle    codepre  pNote the class for which this belongs merely extends Hashtable, so the get method being used here is the Javas hashtables get method.p  pSo I think this is poor OOD design because if I ever further extend unit Im going to have to add more checks and more get methods to this hashtable.p  pAm I correct in saying this  Does anyone have alternative OOD suggestions if this is the casep

Negative 1362 pSo a little trivia first..p  pThere is written in ASP.NET website, which uses NTLM protocol to authenticate users that want to log in. Its perfectly ok when they normally use it, they type in website URL, they provide their credentials, authenticate and maintain session in web browser.p  pWhat I want to do, is create PHP website that will act as bot. It is my companys internal website and I am approved to do so. The problem I run into, is managing session. Users will be able to type in their credentials in my PHP website, and my PHP website will authenticate them to target site, using cURL. p  pThe code I got so far isp  precode    cookiefilepath  dirnameFILE . cookies.txt     ch  curlinit            curlsetoptch, CURLOPTUSERPWD, username.  . password      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, 0      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTUSERAGENT, useragent      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, url      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYHOST, 0      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHTTPAUTH, CURLAUTHANY      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIEFILE, cookiefilepath      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIEJAR, cookiefilepath      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATION, true      curlsetoptch, CURLINFOHEADEROUT, true      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTFAILONERROR, 0      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTMAXREDIRS, 100          ret  curlexecch codepre  pAbove code logs in to target website by cURL which manages NTLM handshake, as it seems, and fetches websites content. It also stores Session ID that is sent back in cookie file. p  pWhat Im trying to do next, is comment the codeCURLOPTUSERPWDcode option, in hope that this script will use session ID stored in cookie file to authenticate previously logged in user in second execution of this script. It could get rid of user credentials and do not store it anywhere that way, becouse it is not safe to store it in manually created session, database, or anywhere else.p  pI need this becouse bot will be using CRON to periodically check if website status has changed and perform some user actions as reaction to this. But to do this, user first must be authenticated, and his username and password must not be stored anywhere, so I have to use session information estabilished when he initially logged in.p  pCURL seems to NOT DO THIS. When I execute script second time with commented codeCURLOPTUSERPWDcode option, it does not use stored cookie to keep beeing authenticated. Instead, it strongREWRITESstrong cookie file with not relevant data send to me from service as response to strongNOT AUTHRORISEDstrong access request. p  pMy questions are  Why cURL doesnt use stored session information to keep beeing authenticated Is there any way to maintain this session with cURL and NTLM protocol based websitep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1362 pAfter html is entered into a container from a ajax response I would like to bind an event to various elements. I know this can be achieved by running addEventListener or oneventfunction right after the html is inserted.p  pMy problem is that I am unsure of the best method to do so with dynamic content, whereas the data passed into the event is different each time.p  pFor example, the following html is loaded into a containerp  precodeltbutton idmyButtongtgoltbuttongt codepre  pNow, I need to bind an onclick function to the button element that contains data that was rendered on the remote side  the onclick function would be something likep  precodemyFunctiondata1,data2,data3 codepre  pwhereas data1,data2,data3 are variables with the dynamic data.  One way I can have this function bound to the button is by outputting a script to be evaluated after the HTML data is inserted into the container, so the HTML output would go like thisp  precodeltbutton idmyButtongtgoltbuttongt ltscriptgtdocument.getElementByIdmyButton.addEventListenerclick,functionmyFunctionltphp echo data1.,.data2.,.data3 gtltscriptgt codepre  pIs there anyway I can achieve the result from the above code in a more flexible way without having to output that script line for every element and for each requestp  pA way that I thought of is to have a bind function that is called after every request is completed, and in this function every element that needs an event bound is stored in an array. A loop goes through the array and binds the appropriate event and function  but this gets complicated with dynamic data. Any ideasp

Negative 1362 pWeve been having a debate at work recently about the merits of encoding output data from trusted sources such as an Active Directory. We have a web application that displays list of users that are queried from AD and allows them to be managed in various ways. The argument goes that if the data coming from the AD is not Html encoded, then its possible to inject script and perform XSS style attacks against the site if you have access to the Domain Controller for example by adding a script as the first name name of a AD user. p  pThe two schools of thought 1 for not validating and 2 for validating seem to bep  ol liIf youve got access to the DC, you can do a lot worse than inject code into a site which displays information youve already got access to. You could also just view the information directly. So why bother li liIf you were a domain admin, you could craft this attack thus creating a backdoor which would enable you to get access to information even if you left the company.li ol  pI think the issue at hand is really a more generic one, do you need to guard against and thus encode output data from a trusted source, in addition to the common practice of guarding against malicious input.p

Negative 1362 pIm concerning a failover scenario for a persistence and Im considering the way it should be properly implemented. Out of previous experience Im thinking that in case underlying persistence failed to store entity, it should be able to store it later as soon as problem will be solved. In terms of Hazelcast entity being cached in map has states that manage its relation to MapStore.p  pWhat happens if MapStore implementation fails to store How to make entity to be reapplyied to MapStore businessp  pUpdatep  pIts not a problem to implement failover in MapStore itself to keep entries in queue unless underlying persistence business will become available but this breaks ideas of distributed memory. On the other hand it potentially can cause inconsistencies if data appeared in MapStore will be put back to cache, isnt itp

Negative 1362 pIm using Grizzly to serve a Jersey application, while using Logback for my logging needs.

For this purpose I would need some place to hook up a listener to the HTTP processing which gets notified about incoming requests where I can put the address into the MDC and when a request is done so I can clean up the MDC. One approach I followed is to hook up a codeContainerFiltercode instance with Jersey, which looked like thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeclass MdcFilter implements         ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter       Override     public ContainerRequest filterContainerRequest request          MDC.puthttpclient, foo  no way to get the address here          return request           Override     public ContainerResponse filter             ContainerRequest request,             ContainerResponse response           MDC.removehttpclient         return response        codepre  pUnfortunately, a Jersey codeContainerRequestcode does not provide information about the connected client which cam as a real surprise.p  pI suspect a similar interface should exist with Grizzly itself, but I was unable to dig it out.p

I can get my application to launch fine and it shows the window and dialog correctly, but I cannot figure out how to add rows of data to the List Store programmatically and have them appear in the Tree View most tutorials I find seem to prefer to make the rows in Glade, or to design the whole interface through the code. With the code as it is I receive no errors when running the program, but I cannot see anything being added in GtkTreeView. I dont see any blank rows being added either.p  pBy writing some code to forcibly generate an error, I can see that the signal for codepostingButtoncode is being connected I think so that should be fine.

Negative 1362 pSo I have successfully used the calculator example to speed a compilation of a relatively simple grammar up by about 50 . The calculator example can be found a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1420libsspiritexampleqicalc6 relnofollowherea. However, there was one thing in the example, which I didnt really grasp, namely a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1420libsspiritexampleqicalc6calc6c.cpp relnofollowcalc6c.cppap  precodeinclude calc6c.hpp   This is not really called. Its only purpose is to  instantiate the constructor of the grammar. void instantiatestatement      typedef stdstringconstiterator iteratortype     stdvectorltintgt code     statementltiteratortypegt gcode  codepre  pI find the comment really confusing, especially, since when I tried it in my code using my grammar it didnt matter if such a function was included or not. I could successfully compile with and without this compilation unit. It seems to me the grammar is instantiated on ll. 74 in a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1420libsspiritexampleqicalc6calc6.cpp relnofollowcalc6.cppap  precodetypedef stdstringconstiterator iteratortype typedef statementltiteratortypegt statement  vmachine mach                    Our virtual machine stdvectorltintgt code            Our VM code statement calccode             Our grammar codepre  pSo why is the function instantiatestatement needed at all Or rather What is the difference between having a compilation unit that contains the instantiatestatement function as opposed to not having such a compilation unit when compiling the final programp  pAlso, I looked far and wide, but there doesnt seem to be a page covering this example  or, for that matter, a more generic example of splitting up a grammar into multiple compilation units  in greater detail and the example is completely gone in more recent incarnations of the BoostSpirit documentation.p

However, my understanding is also that C does not do Multiple Inheritance, thus if I ever need to use emanotherem abstract class, then I no longer can.p  pIn that case, I feel that implementing a custom codeICloneablecode e.g. codeICustomCloneablecode would be the better option, but if the implementation is effectively the same across many classes, I feel like Im not adequately taking advantage of code reuse.p  pThat being said, is it valid to use an interface to keep the abstract inheritance clear for more important things in my cloneable classes Or is there another way to do this p  pAlternatively, is it valid read not smelly for an abstract to implement another abstract This would be my guess as to getting around the singleinheritance that prevents me from implementing the CloneCapable class as well as another abstract, but it sounds like it might be questionable. e.g.p  precodepublic abstract class CloneCapable    public object ShallowCopy         implementation       public object DeepCopy         implementation      public abstract class ClassA  CloneCapable    abstractabstract since I cant do ClassB  ClassA, CloneCapable public abstract class ClassB  ClassA   codepre

Heres something concretep  pOur code does the followingp  precodeFILE  fout  tfsopenT.txt, Tw, SHDENYNO fputtsW2TLn, fout fclosefout codepre  pUnder MBCS build target, the above produces a properly encoded file for code page 932 assuming that 932 was the system default code page when this was run.p  pUnder UNICODE build target, the above produces a garbage file full of .p  pI want to define a symbol, or use a compiler switch, or include a special header, or link to a given library, to make the above continue to work when the build target is UNICODE without changing the source code.p  pHeres the question as it used to existp  blockquote   pcodeFILEcode streams can be opened in translated or binary modes.   Desktop applications can be compiled for UNICODE or MBCS under   Windows.p      pIf my application is compiled for MBCS, then writing MBCS strings to a   wt stream results in a wellformed text file containing MBCS text   for the system code page i.e. the code page for non Unicode   software.p      pBecause our software generally uses the t versions of most string amp   stream functions, in MBCS builds output is handled primarily by   codeputspszMBStringcode or something similar codeputccode etc.  Since   codepszMBStringcode is already in the system code page e.g. 932 when   running on a Japanese machine, the string is written out verbatim   although line terminators are massaged by codeputscode and codegetscode   automatically.p      pHowever, if my application is compiled for UNICODE, then writing MBCS   strings to a wt stream results in garbage lots of    characters i.e. strongI convert the UNICODE to the systems default code   pagestrong and then write that to the stream using, for example,   codefwritepszNarrow, 1, length, streamcode.p      hr      pI can open my streams in binary mode, in which case Ill get the   correct MBCS text... but, the line terminators will no longer be   PCstyle CRLF, but instead will be UNIXstyle LF only.  This, because   in binary nontranslated mode, the file stream doesnt handle the   LFCRLF translation.p      hr      pstrongBut what I really need, is to be able to produce the exact same files I used to be able to produce when compiling for MBCS correct   line terminators and MBCS text files using the systems code page.strongp      pObviously I can manually adjust the line terminators myself and use   binary streams.  However, this is a very invasive approach, as I now   have to find every bit of code throughout the system that writes text   files, and alter it so that it does all of this correctly.  What blows   my mind, is that UNICODE target is stupider  less capable than the   MBCS target we used to use  Surely there is a way to toggle the C   library to say emoutput narrow strings asis but handle line   terminators properly, exactly as youd do in MBCS buildsemp blockquote

Negative 1362 pI have a Windows service which I can install on my local machine using installutil no problem.p  pNow, this service has to be installed on a server. I copy all files to the server and run the same command, set the service to log on as a local user account and when the service starts I get an error saying logon failed  okay so perhaps the user account is the issue.p  pSo I change the service log on as to local system account. I start the service and I am told The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.p  pSo I googled and tried various solutions but to no avail. So I got to thinking maybe it was something in the OnStart method which broke even though I have logging calls which never logged. So I removed all code from the OnStart event and still the service would not start, I got the timely fashion error.p  pSo where am I at I believe it could be due to the references I have defined in the project. To test this I created a new Windows service template from VS2012 with no references other than the default ones and I can start the service.

Negative 1362 pI have 2,500,000 product names and I want to try and group them together, i.e. find products that have similar names.  For example, I could have three productsp  ul liHeinz Baked Beans 400gli liHz Bkd Beans 400gli liHeinz Beans 400g.li ul  pthat are actually the same product and can be merged together.p  pMy plan was to use an implementation of Jaro Winklers distance algorithm to find matches.  The process works as followsp  ul limake a big list of all the product names in memoryli lipick the first product on the listli licompare it to every product that comes after it in the list and calculate a Jaro Scoreli liany products that have a high match say 0.95f or higher are reportedli limove to the next product.li ul  pSo this has some optimisation in that it only matches each product one way around, saving half the processing time.p  pI coded this up and tested it.  It works perfectly and found dozens of matches to investigate.p  pIt takes roughly 20 seconds to compare 1 product to 2,500,000 other products and calculate the Jaro Score.  Assuming my calculations are correct this means it will take the best part of one year to complete the processing.p  pObviously this isnt practical.p  pI have had colleagues go over the code and they managed to make a 20 improvement to the speed of the Jaro Score calculation part.  They made the process multithreaded and that has made it a little bit faster.  We also removed some of the pieces of information being stored, reducing it to just a list of product names and unique identifiers this didnt seem to make any difference to the processing time.p  pWith these improvements we still think this will take a number of months to process and we need it to take hours or a few days at most.p  pI dont want to go into too much detail as I dont think this is entirely relevant, but I load the product details into a listp  precodeprivate class Product      public int MemberId     public string MemberName     public int ProductId     public string ProductCode     public string ProductName  private class ProductList  ListltProductgt   private readonly ProductList pl  new ProductList codepre  pThen I use the following to process each productp  precodeOuter loop... var match  pl[matchCount]  for int count  1 count lt pl.Count count      var search  pl[count]     Dont match products with themselves redundant in a onetailed match     if search.MemberId  match.MemberId ampamp search.ProductId  match.ProductId         continue     float jaro  Jaro.GetJarosearch.ProductName, match.ProductName      We only log matches that pass the criteria     if jaro gt target              Load the details into the grid         var row  new string[7]         row[0]  search.MemberName         row[1]  search.ProductCode         row[2]  search.ProductName         row[3]  match.MemberName         row[4]  match.ProductCode         row[5]  match.ProductName         row[6]  jaro100.ToString,0.0000         JaroGrid.Rows.Addrow       codepre  pI think for the purposes of this question we can assume that the Jaro.GetJaro method is a black box, i.e. it doesnt really matter how it works as this part of the code has been optimised as much as possible and I cant think how it could be improved.p  pAny ideas for a better way to fuzzy match this list of productsp  pI am wondering if there is a clever way to preprocess the list to get most matches out at the start of the matching process.  For example, if it takes 3 months to compare all products but only 3 days to compare likely products then we could live with this.p  pOkay, two common things are coming up.  Firstly, yes, I do take advantage of a single tailed matching process.  The real code for this isp  precodefor int count  matchCount  1 count lt pl.Count count codepre  pI regret posting the amended version I was trying to simplify this a little bad idea.p  pSecondly, a lot of people want to see the Jaro code, so here goes it is rather long and it wasnt originally mine  I might have even found it on here somewhere.

Negative 1362 pI am trying to understand the event filtering mechanism in Qt. To that effect, I have subclassed QLineEdit and tried to capture any key presses before the actual QLineEdit does. The code I have written mostly pasted from the Qt documentation partially works if I press any one key, the QLineEdit correctly says Ate key press LETTER. p  pIf I press down the Option key I am on a Mac and press, say, S, I correctly get Ate key press  however, if I press again S while still holding down the Option key, the QLineEdit reads Ate key press , which I cannot explain. It looks like this second and subsequent press of the key S is not a QKeyEvent or QShortcutEvent and is delivered directly to the actual widget but then, what kind of event is itp  pTo further complicate things, if, while holding down the Option key, I press a key other than S, the results vary depending on which key is it. For instance, for the key sequence OptionS,D,F,G,H, the QLineEdit reads Ate key press . However, if I go on to press J, then the QLineEdit reads only Ate key press .p  pCan anyone replicate this behaviour and, better yet, explain it Thank you all in advance. p  pstrongmain.cppstrongp  precodeinclude ltQApplicationgt include customlineedit.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]      QApplication aargc, argv     CustomLineEdit w     w.show     return a.exec  codepre  pstrongcustomlineedit.hstrongp  precodeifndef CUSTOMLINEEDITH define CUSTOMLINEEDITH  include ltQLineEditgt  class CustomLineEdit  public QLineEdit      QOBJECT public     explicit CustomLineEditQWidget parent  0     virtual bool eventFilterQObject watched, QEvent event   endif  CUSTOMLINEEDITH codepre  pstrongcustomlineedit.cppstrongp  precodeinclude customlineedit.h include ltQKeyEventgt  CustomLineEditCustomLineEditQWidget parent      QLineEditparent      thisgtinstallEventFilter this   bool CustomLineEditeventFilter QObject watched, QEvent event      if eventgttype   QEventKeyPress          eventgttype   QEventShortcutOverride          QKeyEvent keyEvent  staticcastltQKeyEventgtevent         thisgtsetTextAte key press   keyEventgttext         return true      else if eventgttype   QEventShortcut          thisgtsetText Shortcut event         return true      else          return false       codepre

Negative 1362 pI have a tricky and interesting question to You.p  pWhile working on IO tasks such as protocol implementation via some transport layer in Twisted, Tornado, I found a similar scenario or pattern. The pattern is rather generic than abstract. For example, when you are working with a hrefhttpgoo.gly7Dc9MODEMalike device, you send him commands and receive the results.p  pHowever, sometimes you need to react on the response of a modem on last command with new commands. For example, suppose that modem is M,  is communication operator that takes one parameter, message key, and server is S.p  precode    1. s gta M        1.1 M gtb S  modem reacts on a as b so next we should send him command B        1.2 M gtc S  modem responses on a as c so next we should send him C     2. s gtb M        2.1 M gtg S        2.2 M gt f S        ...        2.N M gt x S     ... codepre  pSo, it looks like FSM behaviour. It would be nice to implement this scenario in tornado, while working with nonblocking IO via streams objects. By simply providing tracking scenario as an input and overriding handlers to the statesevents described in input we can reach nice finite state machine behaviour.p  pInput may have the following notationp  precode   a b, c, d,   b c, exitsilence,   c a, exitsilence,   d b  codepre  pwhere all these alphanumeric signs are state names. each keyvalue pair is state name and possible set of state transitions.p  pWhat is possible implementation of FSM using introduced in tornado coroutines and futures  Please share your minds and code.p

Negative 1362 pi want to set an image to a custom UIView. I created the Image in Photoshop with 100 by 100 pixels. Then I didp  precodeself.customView.backgroundColor  [UIColor colorWithPatternImage[UIImage imageNamedImage.png]] codepre  pAnd it worked just fine, except that i could see the pixels on my Retina display. Dont get me wrong i saw that coming, because i set the image in Photoshop to 100x100 and the UIView to 100x100. So due to the false pixel definition in xcode it is displayed with the double size pixels. But how can i create a image, say an image with 200x200 and then set it to the background of the 100x100 View so it is displayed with native resolution. I tried to search for something like scale to fitfunction for the backgroundPattern for the UIView but couldnt find anything. So my question is, how do i set an image as Retina 2x Image  And how do i get it into my UIViewp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1362 pHere is the code for 7 markers being displayed on a GoogleMap. To each marker, I added a mouseover and mouseout event that openscloses an InfoBox. This code works fine in IE, Firefox and Opera, but in Chrome I am facing serious problems. p  pIn Chrome 32 strongthe mouseover event does not open the InfoBox anymorestrong. The event fires, which can be seen by the marker coordinates being displayed in the console. Also, the InfoBox works fine, since clicking on the marker opens the InfoBox for a moment. p  pMy first guess that is has to do with the mouseout listener, since all InfoBoxes are displayed correctly when I remove this listener. But then strongI replaced the loop to add the markers by a setInterval functionstrong, where I keep adding the same 7 markers one after another i.e. several layers of each marker. strongAnd strangely enough, everything works fine thenstrong. Therefore I assume that it has to do with Chrome not focusing on the map once the markers are set. I just cannot figure out the details of it and would therefore be happy for your input p  pPlease find below the original code, and after that the part modified with setInterval.p  pThank you so much...p  precodeltDOCTYPEgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetUTF8 gt     lttitlegtInfoBox Issuelttitlegt     ltscript srchttpmaps.google.commapsapijssensorfalsegtltscriptgt     ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpgooglemapsutilitylibraryv3.googlecode.comsvntagsinfobox1.1.9srcinfobox.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var markers  [] var lats  [52.1512267, 52.0834868, 52.1950463, 52.1365344, 52.1210918, 52.3727503, 52.3794252] var lngs  [5.3804623, 5.1503427, 5.3829468, 5.2103806, 5.2853468, 4.8999749, 9.7271] var map var myOptions                   isHidden false,                 enableEventPropagation true   var ib  new InfoBoxmyOptions   function addMarkercoordinates    var marker  new google.maps.Marker     position  coordinates,     map map,     icon httpchart.apis.google.comchartchstdmappinletterampchld1FAFA0C000000,      markers.pushmarker     google.maps.event.addListenermarker, mouseover, function          var boxText  document.createElementdiv         boxText.style.cssText  backgroundcolor white border 1px solid BAB7B6         boxText.innerHTML  ltdiv idtestgtMouseoverltdivgt         ib.setContentboxText         ib.openmap, this         console.logmarker.position      google.maps.event.addListenermarker, mouseout, function        ib.closemap, marker             function initialize        map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdgoogleMap,            zoom 7,           center new google.maps.LatLng51.886664,7.267027,           mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP               jQuerystart.clickfunction            remove all markers on the map           for var i  0 i lt markers.length i              markers[i].setMapnull                      markers  []           for var i  0 i lt lats.length i              addMarkernew google.maps.LatLnglats[i], lngs[i]                     google.maps.event.addDomListenerwindow, load, initialize ltscriptgt     ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltinput typebutton idstart valueStartgt     ltdiv idgoogleMap stylepositionrelativewidth800pxheight500pxgtltdivgt    ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd here is the modification of the function initialize that works  but does not make much sense for real life applicationsp  precodefunction initialize        map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdgoogleMap,            zoom 7,           center new google.maps.LatLng51.886664,7.267027,           mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP               jQuerystart.clickfunction            remove all markers on the map           for var i  0 i lt markers.length i              markers[i].setMapnull                      markers  []           var counter  0               timer  setIntervalfunction                      if counter gt lats.length1                       counter  0                      else                         addMarkernew google.maps.LatLnglats[counter], lngs[counter]                        counter  counter  1                                    , 500          codepre

I want to save the user input of the pages into a Java object, so I can send them to the server, as well as restore them later when reopening the ViewPager.p  pAny idea how to go about doing this Originally I thought I should save whenver I change pages OnPageChangeListener, but I cant figure out how to pull up the Fragment of the last page, so I can get hold of the input fields from the WebView to save. I need the save to occur so that the ViewPager always displays the correct data, e.g. when sliding between pages, switching orientations, pauseresume app, etc. p  pThanks very much in advance.  p

Negative 1362 pI got this big .SQF file which is generated by the 3d editor of ARMA2 a game. This editor is bugged in a lot of ways, but its the only easy way to add custom map content. A big example is this problemp  pThe editor writes certain lines to a so called .SQF file. Every object consists of a few lines. The problem is, that the order of the lines is not always being written in the correct order. It results in objects being spawned incorrectly.

While there are less than 500 it should block and wait for the collection to fill. I dont mind if the queue exceeds this value 700, 1000 etc. for short amount of times.p  pI currently dont seem to find a solution to fix this exact problem. I was thinking about using a ConcurrentLinkedQueue and to have the consumer periodically check if the queue has enough data, but that seems rather counterproductive.p  pAnother idea is to use a LinkedBlockingQueue. The producers are not going to block unless the queue is full which means it has Integer.MAXVALUE values  this is not my case, so its all good. The consumer will do a queue.take and add the elements into an internal collection. When the internal collection reaches 500 elements it is going to consume them in batch. p  pDo you have any tipsp  pThanksp

Negative 1362 pI am attempting to consume an API that I do not have control over which is somewhat poorly documentented and somewhat inconsistent. This means that sometimes, the API returns a different type than what is documented or what you would normally see.

That makes a crappy API, but my real problem is How can I more easily track those things down Right now, the errors look something like thisp  precodeNo usable value for identifier Do not know how to convert JArrayListJString3c8723eceb1a, JStringcba8849e7a2f into class java.lang.String codepre  pAfter deciphering the problem why codeJValuetoStringcode doesnt emit a JSON string is utterly perplexing to me, I can figure out the API returned an array when I made my codecase classcode only able to deal with codeStringcodes.

Negative 1362 pRecently I have been bitten by the codeFDSETcode buffer overflow twice. The first time is we have too much socket 1024 to added into the codeFDSETcode. This is an test case, we have disabled it, and add codeassertcode to detect this case.p  pToday we hit another related issue when we run an test case for 1000 times. Each time, the test case will somehow trigger to allocate an socket, and later release it before the test case finished. This test case will hit codeFDSETcode buffer overflow when we run 1000 time. p  pWe have find the root causep  ol liFor each pass, the allocate socket id will increase1, it will not reuse the socket id in a long time. The codeOperating systemcode is codeMACcode, and I think it is an reasonable design to avoid using already released socket without error happen.li licodeFDSETcode only set the codefdsetcode bit array using socket id as index, if the socket id is large, it will overflow. I think codefdsetcode is an bad design.li ol  pWe think the 1000 is an reasonable number. And we dont think define MACRO to set fdset huge is not reasonable and wasting memory and CPU when wait. p  pWe doesnt know how to resolve it, so any suggestionp  pEdit1p  pIt turn out there is socket leak in other place, which violate destructor should release all resource. And this make the socket id increase.  So item 1 is not true. Operating system will reuse the socket id. But anyway, the discuss is helpful, and the codeFDSETcode is bad design, and we should using codepollcode.p

Negative 1362 pSolved.  The solution is to set contentType to applicationjson and use the JSON.stringifyobj instead of obj, but you may then have to change how you get the data on your server, depending on the language or framework.

Ive tried adding various codecontentTypecode arguments but then my server actually gets nothing an empty post request.p  pI also tried setting the data argument to a prestringified string of JSON which is correct, but then jquery escapes it and my server gets thisp  precodefirstNamebill,lastNamejohnson,hobbies[apples,dogs]  codepre  pI tried setting codeprocessDatacode to codefalsecode and that changes nothing.p  pIve researched this for hours and havent gotten it to work.

Negative 1362 pHere is the situation. I am rendering to a canvas. Nothing else is being rendered, the canvas is effectively fullscreen. There is only one view.p  pI want to make a simple text button. This consists of two parts visually drawing it, and checking bounds to see if it is pressed. These two things should be consistent. p  pIdeally the centering is optional, though I would expect switching it to be simple.p  pAfter far too many hours, I suspect it is not simply an alignment issue, but also a use of the API that is the source of the problem.p  pHow can this be donep

Negative 1362 pI have been using java RMI for a while now but I couldnt figure out if the RMI Remote Stubs on the server side are singleton The reason I ask isp  plets assume that one of the RMI implementation methods lower down in the chain of calls have a synchronized method. If for some reason the logic in the Synchronized Method is messed up or hangs, the future RMI calls from the client will hang too while trying to get access to that synchronized method. This will hold true only if the RMI stubs are going to be singleton. If a new object is created on the server side at every remote call from the client, this wont be a problem because than the methods are being called from a different object and synchronized method wont be an issue anymore.p  pLong story short. I am trying to understand how JVM internally maintains rmi remote objects on the server side and if they are singleton. I tried many different javadocs but they dont explicitly mention this anywhere. p  pAny and all help is appreciated p  pstrongEDITstrong Based on some questions and comments, I am refining the question my real question is, does RMI on the server side happen to keep some kind of an object pool based on what one object you export and register  Can you bind more than one object of the same type with the same name somewhat simulating an object pool where RMI can give me any of the objects that I registered or in order to have multiple instances of the same object, I will have to register them with different namesp

Negative 1362 pThis has been going on for a while now, and I just cant seem to understand why.

But how do I make the myDataCellbuttonclick event as the trigger I still need to pass the info from myDataObject to myDataCell.p  pThanks guys. p  pEDITp  pI forgot to mention that my goal of going through such trouble is that I intend to keep myDataCell and myDataObject in a framework.p

Negative 1362 pIm trying to set up a simple WCF service in sharepoint that will take a stream and return a steam. It has a method that looks like thisp  precodepublic System.IO.Stream ConvertSystem.IO.Stream input      do stuff here  codepre  pAt first, I could get it working because it complained about the size of the request. I figured out that this was due to not setting it up for steaming on the server side. So in the codeweb.configcode, I set up its binding like thisp  precodeltbinding nametestBinding maxBufferPoolSize214748347 maxBufferSize214748347               maxReceivedMessageSize214748347              transferModeStreamedgt codepre  pAnd that seemed to solve the first problem, I could now see a steam in my codeConvertcode method and it seems to be processing it. The problem now is on the return leg. In my client side code I did something like thisp  precode        using StreamReader sr  new StreamReaderfile                      var sout  ts.Convertsr.BaseStream             using var fs  File.Createfile  .converted                              while read  sout.Readbuffer, 0, buffer.Length gt 0                                      fs.Writebuffer, 0, read                     Console.WriteLineWrote   read   bytes...                                        codepre  pBut the problem was that codereadcode was always 0. There never seemed to be bytes to read even though I could confirm that the steam has data on the server side. So it occurred to me that the problem is that I need to get the codetransferModecode on the client side too. So I set it like thisp  precode        ltbasicHttpBindinggt             ltbinding nameBasicHttpBindingiSPTest transferModeStreamedgt                 ltsecurity modeTransportCredentialOnlygt                     lttransport clientCredentialTypeNtlm gt                   ltmessage clientCredentialTypeUserName algorithmSuiteDefaultgt                 ltsecuritygt             ltbindinggt         ltbasicHttpBindinggt codepre  pBut now when I try and hit any method on my service including regular, nonsteam one, I get this error   p  precodeHTTP request streaming cannot be used in conjunction with HTTP authentication.   Either disable request streaming or specify anonymous HTTP authentication. codepre  pWhich seems straightforward enough, except I cant figure out how to get the Sharepoint server to accept anonymous connections. If I remove the codesecuritycode stuff, or add a codesecuritycode section on the server side with codemode  nonecode, I get codeMessageSecurityExceptioncodep  precodeThe HTTP request is unauthorized with client authentication scheme Anonymous.  The authentication header received from the server was NTLM. codepre  pSo whats going on here How do I get my returned stream to be readable Do I need to set the server to allow anonymous access If so, howp

Negative 1362 pWe have a C based Multithreaded application on Windows that captures network packets in realtime using the WinPCAP library and then processes these packets for monitoring the network. This application is intended to run 24x7. Our applicatin easily consumes 78 GB of RAM.p  pstrongIssue that we are observing strong Lets say the application is monitoring 100Mbps of network traffic and consumes 60 CPU. We have observed that when the application keeps running for a longer duration like a day or two, the CPU consumption of the application increases to like 7080, even though it is still processing 100 Mbps traffic doing the same amount of work. p  pWe have tried to debug this issue to the thread level using ProcessExplorer and noticed that the packet capturing threads start consuming more CPU over time. This issue is not resolved even after restarting the application. Only a machine restart solves the problem. p  pWe have observed this issue is easily reproducible on Windows 2012 R2 Server OS during over night runs. In Windows 7, the issue happens but over few days.p  pAny idea what might be causing this p  pThanks in Advance p

Negative 1362 pMy application has four different screens which will be encapsulated by fragments on one activity so that a constant AdView can display at the bottom of the application.  Only one fragment will be displayed at a time, along with the ad.p  pIn one of these application fragments however, theres quite a bit of dragging and clicking which Im afraid will lead to false ad clicks, so I want to remove the ad fragment when that particular application fragment is in use.p  pMy question is  is this as simple as destroying the AdView when this fragment is selected and bringing it back when the user leaves that fragment  The reason Im curious is that I didnt know if AdMob would flag my account  does an entirely new ad load every time I instantiate the AdView  Im just afraid that AdMob would see this as me trying to loadunload a bunch of AdViews to cycle through more ads.p  pSo  lets say an ad is set to display for 60s.  The user starts the application and gets an ad at t0s.  The user then moves into the noad screen at t3s, and then back to an addisplaying screen at t24s.  On the move back to the screen with the ad, does a new ad load  Or is this managed by AdMob to keep the ad rate constant regardless of how many requests you make in an ads time intervalp

Negative 1362 pIm a complete beginner in Java programming and Im interested to learn more about its concepts. p  pRecently, Ive been given an exercise which instructs me to display two versions of a picture. The picture to be displayed is provided in the form of a data file of 40,000 digits that are arranged in rows although there is no marker between rows and it starts from the top of the picture. So the first digit represents the top left corner of the picture and the last is the bottom right.p  pBasically, what the exercise wants me to construct a program that plots a dot in one of two colours for each digit. If the digit is in the range 0 to 3 the output should be one colour and for digits in the range 4 to 9 the dot should be in the other colour.p  pI understand I have to use arrays and also loops to perform this. Im familiar with the fillEllipse, drawEllipse, drawRectangle and fillRectangle but this exercise is nothing Ive attempted before.p  pAny hints on how to make this work Your help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1362 pI just recently came upon web components and I find it awesome. Nevertheless, it is still not implemented in all browsers. For that reason im using webcomponents.js in Safari to be able to use HTML imports. There are several articles and tutorials on how to use the polyfills, but I still find the available documentation lacking. In my case, Im creating a visual style guide and need to be able to reuse certain bits of code many times all over the guide. I believe that HTML imports could help me in achieving my goal, but once I load webcomponents.js I dont know how to proceed. Notice that at this point Im not trying to create my own web components, just use imports to load certain HTML bits into certain locations in my visual guide.p  pThis is an example code Im usingp  precodewindow.addEventListenerHTMLImportsLoaded, function e      use strict      var links,         i,         content      links  document.querySelectorAlllink[relimport]  I have more than one link tag      for i  0 i lt links.length i  1          content  links[i].import         alertcontent This shows null       codepre  pNotice that when debugging I can see that codelinkscode is a list of links and that it has all the expected properties including import, but they are null.p  pThis is how my HTML source looks likep  precodeltdiv idouterdivgt     ltdiv idinnerdivgt         ltheadergt             ltinput idinputfield classtextinput typetextgt             ltspan idmessagespangtYou have notificationsltspangt             ltlabel idsnolabelgtltinput idsnocheck typecheckboxgt New onlyltlabelgt             ltlink relimport hrefmainmenu.htmlgt             ltul idmenugt                 ltli idreloadbuttongtReload Allltligt                 ltli idsettingsbuttongtSettingsltligt             ltulgt         ltheadergt         ltsection idsectionreposgt             lth4gtRepositorieslth4gt             ltlink relimport hrefrepolisting.htmlgt         ltsectiongt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNotice that there are two codeltlink relimportgtcode tags in use here.

Negative 1362 pIm trying to write a debugger for a process running lua scripts, and the documented way of doing so in C is to use codeluasethookcodep  precodeint luasethook luaState L, luaHook f, int mask, int count codepre  pcodeluaHookcode is defined asp  precodetypedef void luaHook luaState L, luaDebug ar codepre  pThe hook only gets a codeluaStatecode pointer, which is great, but how can I associate a pointer to my debugger class with it so that I can get back into my debugger class from therep  pI would like to avoid using a global variable in this case as I have multiple codeluaStatecode instances. I suppose I could use a map of codeluaState code pointers to debugger instances, but that doesnt seem efficient. And storing it as a global in the codeluaState code doesnt seem to make sense because in order to be able to retrieve it, I would have to push at least one value onto the lua stack, which seems hardimpossible to do in the case of a lua stack overflow.p  pAm I missing something  How would I accomplish this I know, I could accomplish this in lua code, but I would like to understand how I can do this from the C side.p

So far so good, solution is working, but it happened to be incompatible with other frameworks Spring Batch, specifically as JPA requires preUpdate method to be with empty argument list and I have no idea how to figure out current Session or SessionFactory or EntityManagerFactory, as long as JPA involved from preUpdate method in Grails I passed Session as parameter invoking preUpdate method from event listener. So strongQuestion 2strong How to figure out SessionSessionFactoryEntityManagerFactory from domain method in consistent, framework independent wayp

Negative 1362 pIm modifying an existing model using RJAGS. Id like to run chains in parallel, and occasionally check the GelmanRubin convergence diagnostic to see if I need to keep running. The problem is, if I need to resume running based on the diagnostic value, the recompiled chains restart from the first initialized prior values and not the position in parameter space where the chain stopped. If I do not recompile the model, RJAGS complains.

Negative 1362 pI have an MVC site where I generate a unique token inside the ActionResult  of the Controller everytime the page loads. Now when I try to add retina.js strongwhich also contains some of my custom code codeXmlHttpRequestscode to check if the image existsstrong to my site, it did suppress the 404s but arose another problem, now my Controllers ActionResult would be hit multiple number of times, sometime 2 times, sometime 4 times and sometime 3 times. Which causes my code of unique token generation to be run twice but the page only renders once, which in turn invalidates the tokens. p  pNow there are three versions of my site, Desktop, Mobile amp Tablet. I had this issue in Mobile and Tablet only. I tried to remove my custom code to see if the problem is in my custom code, so when I removed my custom code it fixed the problem on mobile but not on tablet. Then I updated to the latest retina.js still the same issue though.p  pNow I need to add retina.js and the Controllers ActionResult hit only once. The code and the HTML both are really lengthy code about 400 lines and html about 1200 lines with a dozens of partial views also included so I couldnt include them here.p  pstrongPSstrong Dear SO users please bear with me and add to the comments if there is something wrong with my question as my previous questions were downvoted without any reason or suggestion given, which really scared me.

Negative 1362 pIn my app, I am using standard xib files rather than a storyboard and all of the views have the universal size class option selected. When I do the design work, I always work in the any.any frame.p  pAll views are set to use auto layout and size classes.p  pFor just about everything, this works a treat.p  pThe problem comes if I have a codeUIScrollViewcode in the view. It looks fine in any,any and when I move to compact,any the view looks fine with everything in the right place.p  pHowever, if I then test on the device, the scrollview is much larger than the device view, so something has gone amiss.p  pAdding in codescrlView.TranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints  truecode sorts the problem for the scrollview, but then messes up the rest of the view outside of the scrollview.p  pThe scrollview is set to have scrolling enabled and bounces. Everything else is as it comes when you add the scrollview.p  pIt looks as if the scrollview on deployment is set to still be any,any rather than compact,any.p  pIs there a way to fix thisp

Negative 1362 pIm working on a Firefox plugin which will both retrieve and send data to a httpserver, but Im having some issues as to how to do this. The plugin will detect the current url the users on and automatically fetch data comments, score, etc thats related to that page from an httpserver which in turn fetches them from a MySQL server. The plugin also has textfields where the user can submit their own comments and rate the current site.p  pSo far, Ive only coded the layout and behavior JavaScript of the plugin. The server hasnt been implemented yet.p  pSome of the user input needs to be evaluated through a server before being inserted into the database. So the client needs to connect to this httpserver for sending data as well.p  pIve searched online and found a few examples, but none of them seem similar enough to what Im trying to do. Being the first time Im trying to do this, Im unsure of how to approach this.p  pI guess my first question is if there are any common techniques for doing this for Firefox plugins If not, is AJAX and jQuery a feasible approach I read something about Socket.io and Node.js, what about thosep  pIm not looking for code, but rather guidance and advice of how to do this. This is the first time I take on a project like this, and if there is any detail Ive missed out in this post, let me know.p

Negative 1362 pI have some data I want to graph on a semilog scale, however I get some artifacts when there is a large jump between points. On linear scale, a straight line is drawn between subsequent points, which is a fine approximation for visualization. However, the exact same thing is done when using the log scale either by using scalexlog10 or scalexcontinuous with a log transformation. A line between two points on the semilog scale should show up curved.

In the actual data Im plotting there are a few jumps at various points, which makes the plots very misleading when trying to compare two lines. Theyre ROC curves in this instance.p  pOne thought is I can search the data for jumps and fill in some interpolated points myself, but Im hoping for a cleaner way that doesnt involve me adding in a bunch of fake data points.p

I need to solve one problem.p  pLets say I have complete and working mvc app, web services it might be anything  wcf, servicestack, web api... and mobile apps iOS, Android working with my web service. Now when Im on my Admin page is there a way for me update this admin page without having to reload it in response to web service requests when my mobile clients send one.p  pI dont want to ask my database for changes every few seconds though. I really want this flowp  pIm looking at my admin page  Mobile app is sending a request for example if user clicked a button or changed position  Web service gets the request    Data on my admin page changes.p  pEdit Ok. Why its always like this  You look for an answer for long time. Then you ask a question and few minutes later you find possible solution. What Ive already found is server side js events, websockets and long polling. Am I heading in the right directionp

It all runs fine on iPhones but when the app is on iPad not a universal app, iPhone only you can see a brief glimpse of a bad snapshot when the animation starts. Basically it seems to take a snapshot of the whole iPad screen, including the black edges, rather than just the simulated iPhone screen. The app also hides the status bar but you can see the status bar in the brief glimpse which means its probably some kind of bug in iOS as the iPad always shows the status bar for iPhone apps at the top of the screen.p  pHeres the snapshot codep  precodeUIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionsview.bounds.size, NO, 0.0 [view drawViewHierarchyInRectview.bounds afterScreenUpdatesupdate] UIImage snapshotImage  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext UIGraphicsEndImageContext codepre  pIncidentally the flash also occurs when using Airplay to show the app on Apple TV.p

Negative 1362 pis there a way to create a mastermaster relationship in a cluster with 2 servers in a mounted partition in Ubuntu I currently have set up something like this but I have some problems.  To explain it further, I have a partition in which my MySQL db resides and I want to make it activeactive. I want both servers to mount that partition and access that db. One problem is that the connection to the db occurs first and then the mounting. The second is that how can I have both connections active to the db with read and write privileges and no overlapping or problems like that. I found some useful guides for mastermaster but I dont know if this can work in my case with the mounted partition. Thanks, in advance p

So my idea was create a hard link in codeLibraryScript Librariescode to the file in my repository.p  pWhen I first open the hard link, I see the exact same result as when opening the original file in my repo.p  pChecking the hard link in the Terminal renders the following resultp  precoderwrr 2 username  staff  50458 May 15 1645 MyLibrary.scpt codepre  pPay attention to the filesize and the number of hard links 2.p  pWhen I change something in the target file, the hard link doesnt work anymore. Even when I just open the .scpt file, and save it without a change, the hard link seems broken.p  pWhen I check the hard link in the Terminal, it shows the followingp  precoderwrwrw 1 username  staff  0 May 15 1645 MyLibrary.scpt codepre  pSo it is 0 bytes and the number of hard link has been reduced to 1.p  pWhy does this not work Does saving the original file change the inode it refers top

Negative 1362 pSo Im reading data in a file using codemmapcode as follows p  precodeunsigned char mapped mapped  mmap0,size,PROTREAD,MAPPRIVATE,input,0 codepre  pThen I created my host buffer and device buffer for pinned memory p  precodeclmem pinnedbufferinput  clCreateBuffercontext, CLMEMREADONLY  CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR, size, mapped, NULL clmem bufferinput  clCreateBuffercontext, CLMEMREADONLY, inputsize, NULL, NULL codepre  pWithin a codeforcode loop I am p  ul lipmapping the buffer p  precodevoid pinnedMemory  clEnqueueMapBuffercmdqueue, pinnedbufferinput, CLTRUE, CLMAPWRITE, header[3]binputsize, inputsizecur, 0, NULL, ampev, NULL codepreli lipenqueuing the buffer p  precodeclEnqueueWriteBuffercmdqueue, bufferinput, CLFALSE, 0, inputsizecur, pinnedMemory, 0, NULL, ampev codepreli lipunmapping the object p  precodeclEnqueueUnmapMemObjectcmdqueue, pinnedbufferinput, pinnedMemory, 0, NULL, ampev codepreli ul  pHere codemappedcode contains the whole file and is of size codesizecode. What I want is to have buffers of size codeinputsizecode or codeinputsizecurcode, same thing to simplify to send data by blocks. So the offset is codeheader[3]binputsizecode where codebcode is incremented in the loop but it copies wrong data.p  pstrongEDITstrong  If I dont initialize codepinnedbufferinputcode with codemappedcode then I can get a pointer to the host buffer with codeclEnqueueMapBuffercode and copy the data of codemappedcode to that place p  precodememcpypinnedMemory, mappedheader[3]binputsize, inputsizecur codepre  pBy doing so it works but I want to avoid the codememcpycode as it is in a codeforcode loop and it creates huge delays in my program. To solve this problem I wanted to use the codeoffsetcode parameter of codeclEnqueueMapBuffercode but it screws up.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong  with codeCLMEMCOPYHOSTPTRcode instead of codeCLMEMALLOCHOSTPTRcode the result is correct but it takes ages to create codepinnedbufferinputcode.p

Negative 1362 pWe have a suite of components implementing certain interfaces. Recently, the installer was upgraded to use Windows Installer XML. Now, we are contemplating the support of parallel installation of minor versions. This implies some system may have type libraries and component classes registered simultaneously for version 1 and version 2. We found no difficulty doing this  except where the registration of interfaces for marshalling is concerned. Our interfaces use the default marshaller.p  pWe are investigating a failed upgrade scenario, wherep  ol lithe user evolves his software to use the new versions componentsli lideploys version 2 in production side by side with version 1li lifinds a fatal problem with version 2li liuninstalls version 2 to rollback his own softwareli ol  pAfter this procedure, no client of components version 1 have success obtaining objects with CoCreateInstance.p  pWe realized that the installer version 2 is reregistering all interfaces to point to the type library version 2. While version 2 is installed, all clients of version 1 or 2 work, since the interfaces described are the same. When version 2 is uninstalled, however, the registration of these interfaces are not rolledback by MSI to the previous state. Because the registration is pointing to type libraries no longer available, no client can marshall interface pointers that is our interpretation.p  pThis is the WIX code we use to register the component. Version 1 and 2 is the same except for the GUIDs of type libraries and coclasses, and of course the version number.p  precode ltComponent IdFoo.Component GuidPUTGUIDHEREgt   ltFile Sourcevar.Foo.TargetPathgt    ltTypeLib IdPUTGUIDHERE Language0 MajorVersion5 MinorVersion4gt     ltAppId IdPUTGUIDHEREgt      ltClass IdPUTGUIDHERE ContextLocalServer32  ThreadingModelfree Version5.4 Programmableyesgt       ltInterface IdPUTGUIDHERE NameIBar ProxyStubClassId320002042400000000C000000000000046 Versionedyes gt       ltInterface IdPUTGUIDHERE NameIBar2 ProxyStubClassId320002042400000000C000000000000046 Versionedyes gt       ltProgId IdFoo.Bar.5.4 gt      ltClassgt      ltClass IdPUTGUIDHERE ContextLocalServer32 ThreadingModelfree Version5.4 Programmableyesgt       ltInterface IdPUTGUIDHERE NameIBarContext ProxyStubClassId320002042400000000C000000000000046 Versionedyes gt       ltProgId IdFoo.BarContext.5.4 gt      ltClassgt     ltAppIdgt    ltTypeLibgt   ltFilegt  ltComponentgt codepre  pIs this scenario supported by MSI andor DCOM Is there some best practice involved we are missing How should one support the installation and uninstallation of multiple products offering implementations of the same set of interfacesp

Negative 1362 psometimes I cannot start the keyboard to write anything at all. I have placed the EditText inside a LinearLayout, because i understood this is optimal for not having a lag when opening the keyboard phones default one. The app reacts very slowly sometimes when i want to write text in that editText. I have googled it and didnt find a cause for this. This happends in android 4.2 and 5.1, but dont think its api version connected.

Negative 1362 pIm using python 2.7 to compare tonal differences in guitar stings. I asked this same question in a hrefhttpdsp.stackexchange.comquestions24846isitappropriatetousepsdontheanalysisofapluckedguitarstringdsp.stackexchange.coma but didnt have much luck so I figured Id ask here, too.p  pIve found that in matplotlib, there are some great builtin features such as a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orgapimlabapi.htmlmatplotlib.mlab.magnitudespectrum relnofollowmatplotlib.mlab.magnitudespectruma and a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orgapimlabapi.htmlmatplotlib.mlab.psd relnofollowmatplotlib.mlab.psdap  pThe magnitudespectrum function seems to be the no brainer, as it is the FFT of the signal, showing each specific harmonic. However, when comparing various guitar strings, its tricky to pinpoint each peak to compare. The PSD function gives very nice smooth graphs, which is perfect for obvious visual comparisons.p  pMy understanding is that PSDs are useful for random signals but not necessarily known signals. Is this true And is there any reason I shouldnt be using the PSD for guitar string comparisonsp  pHeres what 1 second of a guitar pluck looks like using PSD and magnitudespectrump  pNote that these are plucks of the same string and not different strings. Im trying to make sure that my plucks are consistent prior to comparing various strings.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrU4Gn.png altPSD img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9l17k.png altMagnitude Spectrump

Negative 1362 pI have a picturebox called imagebox which has an image loaded into it via a filebrowserdialog. I have another picturebox which loads the image of the first picturebox into it and that one is called canvasbox. By clicking the first picturebox, it loads the image into the second picturebox. The second picturebox will be where I draw on the image and make changes to it before rendering a final image. My question is, how would I make the second picturebox a zoomed in version I mean to where you can see the pixels in a grid like in Paint.Net Because the first picturebox will always be a small resolution of 32x32 or 64x32, etc so I am trying to make it to where in the second picturebox, you can use a pencil tool and pencil in the pixels precisely where you want them. I want this picturebox to automatically be zoomed in. No scroll wheel zoom or anything. Lets say, I will zoom in at a fixed percentage or something. Enough to where you can easily see the pixel grid. but I need the changes to show up in real time in the first picturebox as I am editing it to see what it looks like in its original size as I edit it in the zoomed size. Later, when I render it, it will be rendered in the same format it started in the first picturebox. I hope I am explaining this well enough. I dont have any code on this because I absolutely have no idea where to begin on something like this. p

Negative 1362 pI have some data stored in Excel tablescode.xlsxcode, which my current Python script reads them into the memory and uses them for calculations. I will explain my script more with an example.p  pSay my excel file has this data under a specific column codea  [1,2,3,4,5]code.p  pI am reading this whole thing into the memory using pandas codepd.readexcelcode and running my own iterator function to getp  precodea0  [1,2,3,4,5] a1  [5,1,2,3,4] a2  [4,5,1,2,3] codepre  pand so on. Basically I am shifting every element by some integer amount. codea0, a1code and codea2code here appear as lists but they are iterator objects, I dont store them.p  pAs you notice here, codea0code is always the same as codeacode, and I dont really need to store codeacode in memory because I only need it once, which is what codea0code does. So what I am trying to do is having some sort of iterator object to iterate over the excel file directly to capture codea0, a1code and codea2code as if I were importing codeacode first and then iterating for codea0, a1, a2code over codeacode.p  pThe reason I am trying to do such a thing is because, the time my script takes for calculations are shorter than what it takes to import the data from Excel. So in order to increase my script in performance, I need to find a way to iterate over Excel rather than saving data into the memory. I would appreciate any help with this.p  pAddition, my comment If codepandascode or some other library had codereadThisCellcode kind of functionality, it would make things easy for me to make my own excel iterator. But I dont know what my options are with pandas or any other library.p
