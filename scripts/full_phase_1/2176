Positive 2176 pI have made a very simple class to test for proper Junit test generating. The problem is that when I create a Junit test, it doesnt find my methods for some reason. I have tried with multiple very simple classes without success. I am starting to think I set up Junit for the project incorrectly.

Positive 2176 pWho I work for the County ambulance service. We have forty ambulances and about two hundred fire apparatus.p  pWhat   I am asking your help to write a compute program in Java. I have a GUI that I constructed in JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0. I am using Netbeans to code up the application. Enclosed is some very simple code for the GUI. My question is in two parts  Question 1. I have an Analysis menu with a Expected Call Volume menu item. I also have the code that reaches into my database and pulls out this information and generates a Poisson frequency distribution. How do I marry those two things together. In other words, when a user clicks the menu item it should fire off the code. How do I attach the code to this menu item Question 2. Perhaps not a question, I am keeping the action code in a separate .java file. The reason I am doing this is to keep separate the gui from the code. I think it will be more manageable to have pieces that do unique things. Is there anything special I need to do to tie this separate java file into the GUI Which java file does this action event go to FXMLDocumentExplorer.java or JavaFXApplication2.javap  pWhen hoping to get this accomplished this before 9 October 2015p  pWhere  JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0 and Netbeans 8.02 on a Windows machine.

Positive 2176 pI am currently working on understanding the Java concept of multithreading. I went through a tutorial which uses the Tortoise and the Hare example to explain the concept of multithreading, and to a large extent I understood the syntax and the logic of the video tutorial. At the end of the video tutorial, the Youtuber gave an assignment that involves applying Multithreading to an olympic race track. p  pUsing my knowledege from the example, I was able to create 10 threads representing the athletes that run within a loop, that executes 100 times representing 100 meters.p  pMy challenge is that when the Thread scheduler makes an Athlete to get to 100 meters before the other 9 athletes, the remaining 9 threads always do not complete their race. This is not usually the case in a standard race track. The fact that a Thread called Usain Bolts gets to 100 first, does not mean Yohan Blake should stop running if he is at 90m at that time. p  pI am also interested in getting the distance note that they are all using the same variable for each thread, so that I can use a function to return the positions of each Thread at the end of the race.p  pWhat I have done that did not work  1 I have tried to use an if else construct containing nine else  statement to assign the distance of each executing thread to a new integer variable. using the Thread.currentThread.getName property and the name of each thread but that did not work well for me. This was an attempt to give positions to the athletes alone using their distance but does nothing about the 9 athletes not finishing the race.br 2 I have also tried to use an ArrayList to populate the distance at runtime but for some strange reasons this still overwrites the distance each time it wants to add another distance.p  pBelow are my codesp  precodepackage olympics100meters  import java.util.ArrayList  public class HundredMetersTrackRules implements Runnable  public static String winner  public void race  for int distance1distancelt50distance  System.out.printlnDistance covered by Thread.currentThread    .getName   is distance meters.   boolean isRaceWonthis.isRaceWondistance if isRaceWon  ArrayListltIntegergt numbers  new ArrayList numbers.adddistance System.out.printlntesting...numbers break       private boolean isRaceWonint totalDistanceCovered     boolean isRaceWonfalse    if HundredMetersTrackRules.winnernullampamp    totalDistanceCovered50     String winnerNameThread.currentThread.getName    HundredMetersTrackRules.winnerwinnerName    System.out.printlnThe winner is HundredMetersTrackRules.winner    isRaceWontrue         else if HundredMetersTrackRules.winnernull     isRaceWonfalse         else if HundredMetersTrackRules.winnernull     isRaceWontrue        return isRaceWon   public void run  this.race        codepre  pThis is my main method I reduced it to 5 Athletes till I sort out the issuesp  precodepublic class Olympics100Meters      param args the command line arguments    public static void mainString[] args     HundredMetersTrackRules racernew HundredMetersTrackRules    Thread UsainBoltThreadnew Threadracer,UsainBolt    Thread TysonGayThreadnew Thread racer,TysonGay    Thread AsafaPowellThreadnew Threadracer,AsafaPowell    Thread YohanBlakeThreadnew Thread racer,YohanBlake    Thread JustinGatlinThreadnew Thread racer,JustinGatlin     UsainBoltThread.start    TysonGayThread.start    AsafaPowellThread.start    YohanBlakeThread.start    JustinGatlinThread.start     codepre

Positive 2176 pThe company I am working for is using a third party tool which relies upon base files with multiple implementations inside of them.  The tool then preprocesses the files to generate the production files.p  pThe problem is that with an IDE and java files, when there are two classes with the same name, the IDE reports a conflict.  Further, since the base file has a different name than the java class, there is an error that the class should be in a file that matches its name.p  pLuckily, the base files are all in dotted directories  directories which start with dot  making them effectively invisible, unless requested to see them.p  pstrongThe goal is to have the dotted directories visible in the IDE, but the contents ignored by the IDE when it comes to compilation though it would be great to have the ctrlclick abilities.strongp  pI am able to accomplish this in Eclipse by allowing my Package Explorer to see .resources and configure the excludes for the project to include ..p  pWith NetBeans, I can update the regex for the Ignored Files OptionsMiscellaneousFiles to not exclude the dotted directories.  This brings all the contents into the IDE, adding them as compilation units.  So, I tried using the Excludes for the project via Project PropertiesSourcesIncludesExclude.  However, this results in removing the units from the IDE as was previously done with the regex.p  pstrongHow can I configure NetBeans to allow the elements into the IDE, but to ignore them as compilation units so as to not have errorsactions reported in the IDEstrongp  pUsing another tool is not an option, nor is not using the tool and creating a different design.p  pThis must be accomplished with NetBeans with the third party tool.p
Positive 2176 pIm having problems with a packaged program I built using the NetBeans IDE and Java Swing. When the project is built from netbeans, it copies all the libraries the program is dependent on, including the sqlite4java API that I use into a folder called lib within the folder dist.

No errors are returned, but the program always fails to go past that point in the executable .jar file.

Negative 2176 pI have a text file that is in a comma separated format, delimited by codecode on most fields.  I am trying to get that into something I can enumerate through Generic Collection, for example.  I dont have control over how the file is output nor the character it uses for the delimiter.p  pIn this case, the fields are separated by a comma and text fields are enclosed in codecode marks.

Negative 2176 pTo use the web service that is part of an SSRS installation, it seems that you need to add a web reference to your project so that you can call it etc see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions818714ssrsgetmetadataofremotereportone of my previous questionsa.p  pBut if I needed to call the web service for different SSRS installations then i need to keep adding extra web references. My asp.net application currently displays reports from several different SSRS installations, not just a single server...p  pIs there a way to either dynamically add the web reference or to dynamically change the server address of where the web service is locatedp

Negative 2176 pI want to write a very simple game in Java to demonstrate a wireless controller Ive built. I thought of something like Breakout or Pong. Currently, I have a prototype Pong implementation that does all animation directly using the AWT functionality. However, this is somewhat awkward to program and also a major CPU hog.p  pMy questionp  pCan someone recommend a library for Java to display simple 2D animations What have you used for similar projects The library should be easy and straightforward to use  Im not looking for something like Java3D. Integrated collision detection would be a pro.p

Negative 2176 pI am trying to center a paragraph tag with some text in it within a div, but I cant seem to center it using margin 0 auto without having to specify a fixed width for the paragraph. I dont want to specify a fixed width, because I will have dynamic text coming into the paragraph tag and it will always be a different width based on how much text it is.p  pDoes anyone know how I can center the paragraph tag within the div without having to specify a fixed width for the paragraph or without using tables p
Negative 2176 pIm trying to write a small application that simply reads data from a socket, extracts some information two integers from the data and sends the extracted information off on a serial port. p  pThe idea is that it should start and just keep going. In short, it works, but not for long. After a consistently short period I start to receive IOExceptions and socket receive buffer is swamped. p  pThe thread framework has been taken from the MSDN serial port example. p  pThe delay in send, readThread.Join, is an effort to delay read in order to allow serial port interrupt processing a chance to occur, but I think Ive misinterpreted the join function. I either need to sync the processes more effectively or throw some data away as it comes in off the socket, which would be fine. The integer data is controlling a pan tilt unit and Im sure four times a second would be acceptable, but not sure on how to best acheive either, any ideas would be greatly appreciated, cheers.p

process it and send it to the strongserial portstrong, else keep polling the strongsocketstrong , repeating this whole process ad nauseum.p  pMy initial attempt used a single thread and I was getting the same problem, which led me to believe that I need to give the serial port some more time to allow it to send the data before giving it more data on the next loop, because once Ive sent data to the serial port Im back polling the socket very hard. Having said that IOExceptions occur after approximately 30 seconds of operation, possibly with what Im saying is I should see IOExceptions immediatelyp  pMy interpretation of the join function, I think, is incorrect, ideally calling readThread.Join from send would allow read to sleep while still pumping the COM port, but where I have it seems to put the send to sleep, which I guess is the calling function and not producing the desired result. p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.

Negative 2176 pThis is more of a correctness question. Say I have a table with a primary key column in my database. In my DAO code I have a function called insertRowstring key that will return true if the key doesnt exist in the table and insert a new row with the key.

Is valid or convenient replacing Relational Database  Lucene with a hrefhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSHomeMongoDbap  pedit Ok, I will clarify Im not asking about risk, I can pay that price in this project. My point is Is MongoDB oriented to this kind of thing Can I make a full search engine with the same perfomance as I can get on Lucene. A friend point me out MongoDB as alternative, but I dont see if the Lucene performance comes with the document alternative and then, I will see it in MongoDB too, or, in other hand, the inverted index and optimitizations are complety independant of document orientation.p
Negative 2176 pI have noticed that the cursor blinks really slowly in my WPF apps. This is much much slower then in the rest of windows. Im seeing it working at about half the rate.p  pIf I adjust the blink rate in the control panel it does speed up the WPF blink rate, but only proportionally, it is still twice as slow as what is shown in the control panel and what is used in the rest of windows.p  pWhat I would like is for the Cursor blink rate to match the standard windows cursor blink rate.p  pIf this is not possible I would at least like to know why there is such a huge difference.p
Negative 2176 pI am trying to encode video in h.264 that when split with Apples HTTP Live Streaming tools media file segmenter will pass the media file validator I am getting two errors on the split MPEGTS filep  precodeWARNING Media segment contains a video track but does not contain any IDR access unit with a SPS and a PPS. WARNING 7 samples 17.073  do not have timestamps in track 257 avc1. codepre  pAfter hours of research I think the IDR warning relates to not having keyframes in the right place on the segmented MPEGTS file so in my ffmpeg command I set keyintmin 1 to ensure keyframes where at every frame, but this didnt work.p  pAlthough it would be great to get an answer, if anyone can shed any light on what a IDR access unit with a SPS and a PPS is or what the timestamps warning means I would be very grateful, thanks.p

Suffice it to say that one small data set with only a dozen elements grows quickly into the trillions of possible combinations and I dont want to task PHP with holding trillions of permutations in its memory at once.p

Negative 2176 pIs there a way to add an attachment to an email youre sending out without the attachment being on the filesystem From reading over the DOM  httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb17515328office.1229.aspx it says that the attachment source can be either a file path or an Outlook item that constitutes the attachment.

Negative 2176 pThis is an example of a type of problem I have been having.p  pWhen a user comes to the home page of my app there are two possibilities, heshe isp  olli logged inli li not logged inli ol  pIf the user is logged in I want to display the username in the top right and a link which says logout.

But this is probably not the best thing to do, although it is simple.p  pNow I believe I should send the initial request for the homepage to a servlet instead of jsp, which will instantiate some object of type HomePage which has subclasses LoggedInHomePage and NotLoggedInHomePage depending on whether a user id is available in the session variable.

But at this point it gets messy again, because I now need to know whether or not I have userId being supplied in my Request object for which I need to use some if statements, or I use a different jsp template which implies having two almost identical jsps sitting on the server for every page.p  pNeither seems elegant. Help most appreciated. If you have a neat solution to this problem please just ignore my description and lay that out, I dont mind throwing away whatever ideas I have presented here.p

Negative 2176 pMy application has some background music playing on a loop, using a codeMediaPlayercode. I stop the music in the codeonPausecode of the Activity so it doesnt keep on playing if the user leaves the application by pressing the Home key, or if they receive a phone call, etc.p  pHowever, I now need the music to continue playing seamlessly when the user moves to certain other activities. That is, if they press button A then I add activity A to the stack and the music should continue however if they press button B then I add activity B to the stack and the music should stop. Similarly the music should continue if they press the phones Back button to return from activity A to the original activity.p  pIve tried starting the codeMediaPlayercode again in the codeonResumecode of Activity A, but theres quite a noticeable gap in the music during the transition.p  pAt the moment Ive got codeonPausecode triggering a halfsecond delay before fading the music out over another quarter of a second this can be cancelled from within another activitys codeonResumecode. This means the music stops just about quickly enough when the users leaving the app however when the user switches activities I still get a slight pause in the music on some slower devices. Furthermore it feels like a really dirty hack.p  pIs there a better wayp  p[Edit if it helps, the codeMediaPlayercode is held in a static class that I can access from anywhere in the application.]p

Negative 2176 pIm a developer by hobby, meaning that I do it on the side and I dont do it too often.  Ive been reading on and off regarding web application frameworks and looking in between at CakePHP and CodeIgniter.  I finally decided to dive further into CakePHP as it seemed to be more up my alley.  p  pProblem is, the more I dive into it the more I dont understand why Im using the framework.  So, hardcore developers out there, discuss with me, or help me understand the followingp  pI do understand in the long run application frameworks are there to help deploy code faster, or write code faster.  Understandable, however, is a limitation of these frameworks the fact that you have to code to the standards of the framework  The more and more I try to use CakePHP, its almost like Im having to learn the framework languagestandards on top of the actual programming language.  For example, Im having to learn CakePHPs standards and ways to implement faster deployment and interpretation but Im also trying to code to PHP standards which is somewhat built into CakePHP, but as a whole, this is what Im seeing.  To me its a bit of overhead, but if you know CakePHP or your framework of choice, this is nothing, because you probably know how to code to your frameworkp  pThe other question or discussion is, as a developer on the side and a person that likes the MVC approach, but does not really know how to implement it with a framework, would the best approach to code the same way I am through a function file, making my own functions, etc, but also put MVC techniques to use  What I mean by this is, instead of learning an application framework, should I separate the content styles from the functions, etc like MVC works, but use my own functions, or should I learn an application framework.p  pNote I could be going about the application framework incorrectly, Im not sure though.  Additionally, this was meant to be a discussion and not a rant I dont know what I dont know, so Im actually reaching out for some clarification.p  pThanksp

In my case, unlike these, the hang arises from a blocking socket that never gets a message, and perhaps thats why the solutions described there havent worked for me.  Im developing in tandem a C app which communicates with the php script via a local socket connection, and when the C app crashes, it leaves the php scripts socket waiting for a message that never comes.  Ive tried using sessiondestroy and sessionunset calling these first in a script before sessionstart but they dont work even quitting and restarting the browser doesnt help.  I can only stop the session if I remove the sessionstart, reload the script and then end the session via the client.  How can I kill the session without having to go through thatp  pEdit I forget to mention, I also tried to time the socket out withp  precodesocketsetoptionsocket,0, SORCVTIMEO, arraysecgt1, usecgt0 codepre  pBut I got an invalid operation error, and it didnt work.p  pEdit 2 Setting a manual timeout, following the tip a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions389645phphowtosetatimeoutonsocketreadherea, worked well enough.

Negative 2176 pI need to programmatically minimize and maximize a fullscreen 16bit application. Unfortunately DosBox is not an option as this app talks to some peripherals not supported by DosBox.p  pI was able to write code heavy on the Win32 API that can set the focus, send the alt  enter keys and minimizemaximize.p  pEverything would work, however, some users have figured out that Alt  Enter can exit fullscreen and have started to abuse this.p  pI can disable Alt  Enter using the settings in a PIF, but that breaks my approach of programmatically sending those keys.p  pIs there a better alternative for getting NTVDM to programmatically toggle fullscreen than sending Alt  Enter p  pI used Spy and found that to achieve fullscreen NTVDM was changing the system resolution to 640 x 480.p  pI attempted to call the ChangeDisplaySettings API to toggle the resolutions as needed, but when I set 640 x 480 NTVDM still runs as a windowed app.p  pIm considering setting up a low level keyboard hook httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms644985vvs.85.aspx to filter Alt  Enter. I could disable the hook for the brief moment it takes my app to send it. This sounds like a dangerous hack that could have a lot of sideeffects. Im also not sure it would work since NTVDM doesnt seem to use a message loop for processing keyboard input. The SendMessage API doesnt produce results, and Alt  Enter had to be sent using the keybdevent API. Any thoughtsp

Negative 2176 pIm thinking about attempting to design a new framework architecture aimed at allowing a web app to later be easily ported into a system such as Drupal or Joomla while maintaining the independence of the original app such that updates to core functionality would require only one release or otherwise minimal extra work.p  pBefore I start on this however, I would like to see what work has previously been done that comes closest to what I am proposing. So an answer to this question would come in the form of a reference to the most similar work or if possible a definitive no that this has not been done before.p  pClarification by example MediaWiki is a common web app that has become one of the most highly recommended of its kind. However, site admins building their sites with Drupal would be required to hack MediaWiki in order for it to play nicely with Drupal in terms of sharing a user base for example. Imagine that MediaWiki has decided to do a complete rebuild of their system, what design could be used to make this interaction simply require a Drupal module or Joomla component and thus make MediaWiki available to more usersp  pIm using MediaWiki as just an example, I think modules and components already exist that solve this particular problem but I hope I am able to get my idea across. It is a problem I have encountered many times during web development now that CMS systems are appearing more and more enterpriselike.p  pThanks godwinp

Negative 2176 pI made a collection for which I want to provide an STLstyle, randomaccess iterator. I was searching around for an example implementation of an iterator but I didnt find any.

Negative 2176 pOur solution has got a ton of projects in it, and our MSBuild file is becoming a gigantic, unstable morass of angle brackets that has gotten so large that Ive begun to be scared to touch it. However, I noticed that most of our projects fall into two groups.p  pThere are web projects, which have a .csproj extension and are built and deployed using web deployment projects to dump them into a directory. There is also a configuration transform process. Basically, to deploy a web project, one only needs the project name, the output directory, and the config transforms.p  pSimilarly, we have an everincreasing number of service apps that will live under TopShelf. These are basically dlls that are built from .csproj files. Like the above websites, they undergo a config transform, but they are copied to the output directory instead of going through the web deployment steps.p  pIt occurred to me that it would be really slick if I could simply provide the MSBuild project with a couple of text files one for the webs and the other for the services that MSBuild could then use to dynamically compile all the various projects. I was thinking that if I could just feed it a commadelimited list of projects, output locations, and config replacement files that there might be a way to get msbuild to read them in, iterate over them, and dump out the projects where they are supposed to go.p  pHowever, my MSBuildfu is weak. How do I even get started on thisp

Heres a lengthy quote from the strongEnumeration Constantsstrong section, emphasis minep  blockquote   pstrongA problem with enumeration enum constants is that their data types are frequently indeterminate. In other words, enum constants are not predictably unsigned int.strong With conventionally constructed enumerations, the compiler actually sets the underlying type based on what it finds. The underlying type can be signed int or even long. Take the following examplep blockquote  precodetype enum      MyFlagError  1,     MyFlagLow  0,     MyFlagMiddle  1,     MyFlagHigh  2  MyFlagType codepre  blockquote   pThe compiler looks at this declaration and, finding a negative value assigned to one of the member constants, declares the underlying type of the enumeration int. If the range of values for the members does not fit into an int or unsigned int, then the base type silently becomes 64bit long. The base type of quantities defined as enumerations can thus change silently size to accord with the values in the enumeration. This can happen whether youre compiling 32bit or 64bit. Needless to say, this situation presents obstacles for binary compatibility.p      pstrongAs a remedy for this problem, Apple has decided to be more explicit about the enumeration type in the Cocoa API.strong Instead of declaring arguments in terms of the enumeration, the header files now separately declare a type for the enumeration whose size can be specified. The members of the enumeration and their values are declared and assigned as before. For example, instead of thisp blockquote  precodetypedef enum      NSNullCellType  0,     NSTextCellType  1,     NSImageCellType  2  NSCellType codepre  blockquote   pthere is now thisp blockquote  precodeenum      NSNullCellType  0,     NSTextCellType  1,     NSImageCellType  2  typedef NSUInteger NSCellType codepre  blockquote   pThe enumeration type is defined in terms of NSInteger or NSUInteger to make the base enumeration type 64bit capable on 64bit architectures.p blockquote  pMy question is this given that the typedef doesnt appear to be tied explicitly to the enum declaration, how does one know if their data types are unsigned int or NSUIntegerp

Negative 2176 h1Backgroundh1  pMy father has an old radio program that he loves. It is a series of recordings done 3040 years ago, but now he has found out that they are sent now and then as a historical retrospects. He loves them and dont want to miss a single one. He is eager to record them so I found a little program called CoolRecord that can record from broadcast through web player. It works OK, but the problem is that there recording is done through audio card and when he uses Skype to talk to his grandchildren he always messes up sound settings and when the next recording session comes everything is chaos ....p  h1Ideah1  pNow I recently found out that it is possible to catch the radio stream BEFORE it passes through the audio card. This is great news I searched and found the url to the broadcast. On a hrefhttpwww.listenlive.eusweden.html relnofollowhttpwww.listenlive.eusweden.htmla I found the following url that looks promising a hrefhttpsverigesradio.setopsydirekt1602himp3.pls relnofollowhttpsverigesradio.setopsydirekt1602himp3.plsa. It is an MP3 decoded stream with 192 kbps.p  pI searched the web and found several software for listening to radio and even record, but all Windows based software that I have found records audio stream after it has passed through the computer audio card .... I actually found a freeware for Mac who does the right thing. It is called FStream but it has no Windows version p  pMy intention is therefore to build a VERY simple program that will always connect to the same radio station and catch the stream directly without going through the audio card. p  pI want to keep it dead simple to my father All he needs to do is to push a big red record button when it is time for his favorite program No hassle with confusing audio settings, just a file automatically saved to his audio directory.p  h1Questionsh1  pI prefer to use C. I guess the .Net class library has some useful methods that might help me on .... But I have never worked with radio streaming and broadcast technology. 1 How do I set up a stream listener 2 Is it possible to detect program title and automate the recording startstop 3 How do I save the stream to a MP3 file Do I need to add headers etc 4 Do I need to take care of possible interrupts in the streamingp

Negative 2176 pIm working on a mobile website its not a single page app which has a very small JS footprint less than 10KB minified and gzipped. There are no libraries or external dependencies, all the code is vanilla javascript written in house. Its logically separated into several files that are concatenated before deplyment in order to reduce the number of HTTP requests. There is no explicit namespacing in the files. That is, they look something likep  precode crossbrowser.js function getScrollOffset       implementation   function ... codepre  pThis is less than ideal, there is no explicit dependency resolution and the scope can get easilly polluted from inside the functions. There is no processing done to check this lint or compiler. As a first step I thought implementing an explicit module system could safeguard against this and make the code better.p  pReading into the CommonJS module format and loaders like RequireJS, Lab.js and others, as far as I understood, when using modules on the browser side, they all expect to load them via XHR. I dont want that, I want to keep the single script format which contains all the modules. My file would look something likep  precodevar define  function    ...   var require  function    ...   definecrossbrowser, function require, exports, module      exports.getScrollOffset  function                      etc.   definefoo, function require, exports, module      var crossbrowser  requirecrossbrowser     exports.getNewOffset  function           var offset  crossbrowser.getScrollOffset          do something         return offset        window.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, function        really dumb example, but I hope it gets the point across     var crossbrowser  requirecrossbrowser,         foo  requirefoo     crossbrowser.scrollTofoo.getNewOffset  codepre  pThe question is wether any of the loaders work this way or do I have to write my own implementation of codedefinecode and coderequirecodep

Negative 2176 pI am working on a project that involves reading messages from a sim, inserting them into a MySQL database table and replying to each of those messages.  My sim can handle a maximum of 30 messages.  Previously what i was doing was reading all the 30 messages at a time, inserting them into the database and at the same time deleting them from the sim so that new messages can come in.  After the messages are in table I take one message at a time and reply to it and at the same time delete it from the table.p  pRecently I tried a new approach using threads.  Now, the messages are read in to table and replied to at the same time.  This has greatly increased performance and decreased the reply time but problems have occurred.  In the following code, I sometimes get an exception on the codeconnection.opencode function after its been able to successfully connect for 3060 seconds.

Negative 2176 pMy question is concerning an application that will use a host application where the database server is, and a few clients that will be sending information to the host.p  pBasically the host application receives some data from the clients, makes some calculations and error checking and then if all goes well it stores the information in the database. The data received could be easily serialized or get character separated in a string of less than 50 characters.p  pI know my basic option in developing this communication application is WCF and have worked with it before but my concerns for this particular case is the fact thatp  ol lipThe host and the clients will at most times be connected to the internet through wireless USB modems which as we all know do not provide the most reliable connection ever.pli lipThere will be many clients all sending information to the host at the same time, each having their own identification id since that determines the type of the data received and what it represents.pli lipDue to the not so reliable connections i would like to be able to know if the packet has been sent successfully, and if not to be able to keep trying until the communication is complete.pli lipNew data will be sent from each client every couple of minutes and if lets say we have a connection failure for 5 minutes i would like to be able to send all unsent information when the connection is restored.pli lipLastly im kind of trying to figure how i would be able to know where to contact the host as the usb modems do not have a static ip and this could change from time to time.pli ol  pMy thought is to either try to establish a communication through WCF services where the clients would send all information to the host directly or maybe consider serializing the data from the clients in XML format, then upload them on a 3rd server that will be available all of the time, and then use the host application every one minute to try and synchronize the available information with the ones one the 3rd server.p  pHope i made it pretty clear with this lengthy post on what im trying to accomplish and would really appreciate your thoughts for a project like this.p

Negative 2176 pI wrote a notsosimple websocket server in python, which listens in a port, performs the handshaking and then sends to the client a sequence of messages spaced out a random interval, containing numbers.p  pI wrote a javascript client and tested it under Chrome and Safari. I discovered that Chrome and Safari use different WebSocket versions. For example, Chrome uses SecWebSocketKey and expects SecWebSocketAccept, while Safari sends instead SecWebSocketKey1, SecWebSocketKey2 and a bunch of 8 bytes after the header. p  pI implemented in the server a handshake function which detects the kind of handshake required, and performs it. This issue is solved. The websocket is correctly open from Chrome or Safari both OSX, Windows and IOS5 versions.p  pBut I have another problem. Apparently, Safari sends and expects messages delimited by 0x00 and 0xFF, while Chrome sends and expects framed and masked data using a more recent version of the websocket specification.p  pI want to have a single server, which adapts himself to the expectations of the client. My question is, how can I tell in advance if the data has to be sent framed or 0x00,0xFF delimitedp  pI guess I could assume that, if the handshake protocol is based in Key1 and Key2, the client is Safari, and then use 0x00 0xFF to delimit data, while if it uses SecWebSocketKey the client is Chrome, and then use framed data. However Im not satisfied with this solution, since it is not general. Ideasp

Negative 2176 pSpring has the nice mechanism a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.1.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlbeans.htmlbeansfactoryplaceholderconfigurer relnofollowPropertyPlaceholderConfigurera for injecting values like timeouts, JDBC Urls and so forth into Spring beans for configuration purposes. Is there a sensible way to handle configuration values that can change at runtimep  pUPDATE With Spring 3.1 there is a nice way to include nonstatic configuration sources such as the database via a hrefhttpblog.springsource.com20110215spring31m1unifiedpropertymanagement relnofollowPropertySourceas. Some ApplicationContexts provide a refresh mechanism that is in principle able to handle changing configuration values. However it stops the application first, then creates all beans fresh and then starts the application context again. However, for our purposes I would need a way to do this transparently, such that the server correctly handles currently running requests.p  pAnother idea to do this would be a custom Scope that creates fresh objects when the configuration changes. Unfortunately the ObjectFactory provided to the Scope uses a preprocessed bean definition, such that the placeholders are not read anew from the configuration. Thus the created objects have the same configuration. p

Negative 2176 pI am using emGit Extensionsem as addin in Visual Studio 2010. It is working great.  However, whenever I am going to commit to repository, the GUI forces me to manually select the appropriate files for adding to the stage even if these files has been indexed and added to the stage already. I am a little bit confused since my believe was that already staged files do not require a selection for the stage again.p  pExample In the Git Extensions GUI, I am adding Network.cpp to the stage after using emCommitem. In the next, I type any arbitrary but useful description and commit the staged files. The next time the Network.cpp has been changed, I have to stage Network.cpp again after committing to repository.p  pIs there anything completely wrong in my workflowp  pThanks in advance for your help.p

One is the trips origin and the other is its destination.p  precodeclass Trip lt ActiveRecordBase   hasone origin, as addressable, classname Address   hasone destination, as addressable, classname Address end codepre  pThe problem is that when Rails creates an address which is associated with a trip, it uses the class name which is Trip to fill in the codeaddressabletypecode column. That means that if I try to make a trip with an origin and destination, rails attempts to add two rows with the same codeaddressabletypecode and codeaddressableidcode. This obviously fails at the uniqueness constraint.p  pI could remove the uniqueness constraint but then I would just end up with duplicated records which would confuse Rails because it wouldnt know which record was the origin and which was the destination.p  pWhat I would really like to do is specify the string to use for codeaddressabletypecodep  precodeclass Trip lt ActiveRecordBase   hasone origin, as addressable, classname Address, type Trip Origin   hasone destination, as addressable, classname Address, type Trip Destination end codepre  pIs that possible Is there another solution or do I need to rethink my database schemap

Negative 2176 pLet me describe my situation firstbrbr I have a blog website, where the blog entries are stored in a MySQL database and then loaded when the user accesses the website. Each blog post has tags that can be used to search the blog posts. I want users to be able to get my individual blog posts as results when they use a search engine like Google to search relevant words in the tags or title of the post.brbr  For example, if I have a post with the title, Including blog post title in URL for search engine optimization, and a user searches something like blog post title in url seo, then I would expect that my post should show up as one of the results like when you search for programming questions on Google, a lot of the results come from Stackoverflow.brbr Im guessing I have to implement a system where I create a dynamic php page called post.php where this same page is used to display individual blog posts with the title of the post included in the url. Also it would be nice to have the post tags be included as meta keywords of this page. But I dont want to have a static page of each blog post on my server just so I can include the title in the url. If you look at the way stackoverflow does it, they have individual posts linking to urls where the title of the post is included in the url itself. I would like to have something similar. So my final reworded questions are p  p1 strongIs including post titles in URL good for SEOstrongbrbr 2 strongIs using dynamic pages that load blog post data from MySQL bad for SEO because the data isnt physically present on the websitestrongbrbr 3 strongHow do I create a dynamic page that is used to display individual blog posts when they are clicked and has the blog post title in the URL similar to what Stackoverflow doesstrong BONUS if it can have the post tags as meta keywords that would be super awesomep

Negative 2176 pI have implemented a design in C that is I parse an XML file which contain the ip and port of several servers,for each ip and port i first call the connect to server function in which i make a TCP socket connection with the server whether the connection is established or not i make a thread for each ip and port,if connection is not established i send the status of the server that connection is not established and if connection is established i then make a request to the server and receive response from the server in the thread.This is done after every minute for each thread. Now the problem that i am facing is,if connection terminates or if the server power goes,how to again make a connection i mean after every one minute before sending request and receiving response from the server i have to check whether the connection is still there or not. Can you please tell me how to do thatp

But it doesnt work for any classes or IDs inside the group embedded through codeltusegtcode.p  pHow to fix itp  pOr maybe theres a better way to do itp  pI need to change only this particular part inside the embedded object when the user hovers it, not the whole group.

Some parts of this object need to be styled with custom colors from the CSS, because I need easy customization of those colors without changing the library objects code.p  pAnd then I need to signal the user when the mouse pointer is above such active object by styling its parts differently some bright outlines here and there to show the shape of the clickable areas when the mouse pointer is over them.p  pUnfortunately, I cannot apply the style to the codeltusegtcode elements subelements, because theyre not subelements of codeltusegtcode in the DOM as others already mentioned. I can apply some styles to the elements inside the codeltdefsgtcode section, because theyre in the DOM and theyre addressable with CSS selectors, but they emcannotem be hovered, because theyre invisible, so applying codehovercode pseudoclass to them doesnt work. And it doesnt work either if this class is applied to the codeltusegtcode, because then I cannot subselect the proper sub elements theyre not subelements of codeltusegtcode. So I dont have any hook to apply those codehovercode pseudoclass to.p  pMaybe theres some other solution to my problemp

So what does the UINavigationBar in IB actually do if I cant have it in my initial container view controller, without embedding in the UINavigationController  Or is it just for aesthetics and you can only use it with UINavigationControllers   Thanks.p

Negative 2176 pI am using Socket.io to stream live tweets to my users using Twitters Streaming API my implementation is more or less based on a hrefhttpwww.iavington.comPostsPostusingnodejsandsocketiotostreamtweetsfromthetwitterapi relnofollowthis tutoriala. p  pThe problem is that every time a connection event is fired by Socket.io the newly connected client causes every other client connected to the server to cease updating. While it would take too long to go through all the hacks that I tried, I will say that I played with it enough that I believe the problem is caused by Socket.ios multiplexing of the connections from multiple clients enabled by default as a performance boost to allow multiple clients or connections to share the same underlying socket. In short, I believe this to be the case because I dont think it would be possible for new connections to affect older connections in this manner if not for the connection multiplexing. In other words, if a new, independent connection with its own underlying TCP socket were created every time a client connected it would be impossible for this to occur since one connection would know nothing about the other and therefore couldnt affect any other clients state as is currently happening. This also leads me to believe that simply disabling the multiplexing functionality would be the simplest way to get around this problem since I am not concerned about scaling because Node.js already handles all the concurrency Im likely to need to handle very adequately. p  pI have gone through Socket.ios a hrefhttpsgithub.comLearnBoostSocket.IOwikiConfiguringSocket.IO relnofollowdocumentationa but could not see where the ability to demultiplex the connections is exposed via the API, so if anyone knows how to do this Id create appreciate your response. p  pMy code below is pretty standard and simple. But just to be clear, the issue is that whenever a new client connects to Socket.io every other client stops receiving new tweets and updates are no longer pushed to the older client unless I refresh the browser in which case the newly refreshed client will begin to update and receive fresh tweets again, but the other still connected clients will then stop updating. p  pstrongServerside Codestrongp  precode Code also uses ntwitter httpsgithub.comAvianFluntwitter as an abstraction over Twitters Streaming API io.sockets.onconnection, function socket    tweet.streamstatusesfilter,  track  new orleans , function stream       stream.ondata, function data         The following lines simply preprocess data sent from Twitter so junk isnt        unnecessarily sent to the client.       if data.user           tweets            text   data.text,          image  data.user.profileimageurl,          user   data.user.name                    var t  JSON.stringifytweets          console.logt          socket.sendt                   codepre  pstrongClientSide Codestrongp  precode Notice the option that I passed in as the second argument.

Negative 2176 pI have a table view controller, A, which does a push segue to a view controller, B. B then does a modal segue to a view controller C. I have a button on C which needs to result in the dismissal of C which is modal as stated and ALSO the popping of B so that we go back to A. In C, I have detected the button press and used a delegate to call back to B which then dismisses the modal view controller C using thisp  precode[sender dismissViewControllerAnimatedNO completionnil] codepre  pB then uses a delegate to call back to A which pops B from the stack using thisp  precode[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedYES] codepre  pNow this all works, except for the very annoying fact that I briefly see B during all this, whereas I would like to be able to pop from C straight back to A without seeing B at all, however briefly.

Negative 2176 pIm using Mongoids recursivelyembedsmany to create a nested data tree Rails 3.2.8, Mongo 2.2, Mongoid 3.0.14, and Ryan Bates nestedform gem 0.3.1. Everythings gone swimmingly so far, but Ive hit a snag and I cant seem to figure my way out of it, specifically, how to reorder the members of the array that get generated. I have a bit of JS to help me on the frontend manipulate the form, but I havent been able to figure out to get that new order represented in the backend. Heres my main modelp  precodeclass Navigator   include MongoidDocument   include MongoidTimestamps    embedsmany menuitems   acceptsnestedattributesfor menuitems, allowdestroy gt true, autosave gt true    field name   field type   field position   field behavior end codepre  pand heres the MenuItems modelp  precodeclass MenuItem   include MongoidDocument   include MongoidTimestamps   recursivelyembedsmany    acceptsnestedattributesfor childmenuitems, allowdestroy gt true, autosave gt true    field name   field url end codepre  pWatching the server, I can see that what currently happens is that during an update, new items are added via the codepushallcode method and other items are updated via the  positional operator matching for nested arrays method which looks to be a hrefhttpsgithub.commongoidmongoidissues2545 relnofollowMongoids implementationa of the a hrefhttpjira.mongodb.orgbrowseSERVER831 relnofollowJIRA SERVER851 workarounda. As a result, the position of each menuitem is always fixed based on where it was entered. I know that I could add any number of ordering attributes and strategies, but this seems unnecessary in Mongo since it is possible to have the order of the array be representative of the order imposed on it by a user.p  pI understand that Mongo has the above limitation, but it also seems reasonable to overwrite the array every time its updated, in other words, use Mongos codesetcode operator to replace the existing contents of that array. However, I cant figure out how to do this with Mongoid. I was hoping that it might be as simple as switching my controller fromp  precodetree.updateattributesparams[tree] codepre  ptop  precodetree.setparams[tree] codepre  pThis results in the query being correctly formatted, but completely escaped. Then I thought maybe I could codeunsetcode the field first, and delete the hidden id field in the form, but that fails too.p  pIt seems to me that this is a canonical use case for Mongo, but also that Mongoid is preventing me from updating the document in a Mongoy way. I also know that Mongoid is capable of using the codesetcode operator, because it gets used to overwrite the codeupdatedatcode attribute thats added because of the use of Timestamps. If I could configure Mongoid to simply use the codesetcode operator for an update instead of the  positional operator workaround, Id be set. Am I thinking about this the wrong way or missing something My next step is to try to escape directly into the Mongo driver.p  pThanks, Carlp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  precodetree.updateattributetree, params[tree] codepre  pcreates the correct moped output, but the data isnt getting updated. Even if I change something that has nothing to do with modifying the array.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWhile I couldnt figure out a Mongoid solution, I was able to figure out a jQuery one I was already using it to rename the array keys after using jQuery UI sort, so I added a couple of things along for the ride. I make a copy of all the items, set the existing ones to be deleted and then add the copies as though theyre new. When the form gets submitted, all the old ones get deleted first then all the copies get added as new in the order they are on the page. Its not an ideal solution, but it works fine and I feel well within the spirit of all the technologies  the form is still being processed all at once and I dont need to add an external sorting attribute on any of the models. It wont work if JS is turned off, but then neither would the draganddrop sorting.p

Negative 2176 pI have migrated a series of tables from an SQL Server 2008 to a new SQL Server 2012 machine via Transactional Replication. That works fine so far and I also replicated indexes and default values to ensure the replicated data is equal to the original one.p  pWhen I detach the new machine from replication to act standalone as a replacement of the old machine, SQL Server starts filling up all the gaps in my identity columns which may cause different troubles. I.e. my code cant rely on having the highest ID for the last inserted line anymore. Also previously deleted userIDs are recycled which may cause confusion at users side too.p  pIs there a way to make the new instance of my DB acting exactly like the old replicated one In my experience, a running instance of a database never fills up gaps of previously deleted rows.p

Negative 2176 pIve seen a few questions on here asking similar questions, but Ive not yet seen a suitable answer. Many people have asked how to update the UI from a thread, but theyre almost always in the same class as the UI. p  pWhat Im trying to do is update the UI from a thread which has been created in another class. Ive seen all of the suggestions, such as async, handlers, runnable, etc... but Ive having real trouble implementing them in separate classes.p  pIm trying to keep my UI class minimal and only deal with interactions with the GUI, such as when a user presses a button. Now, Ive created a new thread, in a new class, which connects to a Bluetooth device, but I then want to change a button in the UI thread from being a connect button to a disconnect button i.e. change the button from creating the Bluetooth socket to closing it. p  pWhat is the general way to do this Am I thinking of this all wrong and should have everything in one class What is the correct way to interact between the main UI class and other classesthreadsp  pIdeally I want to be able to do other UI interactions, so some solution which allows other UI changes outside of the UI class would be greatp

Negative 2176 pWe are having a problem with a virtual machine thats running our frontend website. Once its running everything is fine, but after a reboot memcached is  going bonkers. What happens is that we put items in there set to expire in 15 to 30 seconds, but they dont expire for about an hour So after a while all data were serving is highly outdated.p  pWeve been investigating the issue for a bit and found that during startup ntp is changing the clock ema lotem, putting it almost an hour forward. p  pWe found that memcached doesnt use the system clock but has its own clock, so once the system clock changes and sets the expiry in its time, memcache is an hour behind and will keep the item for an hour. p  pWeve already swapped the boot order of ntpd now S58 and memcached now S59, but that hasnt resolved the issue.p  pRestarting memcached manually after a reboot is not really option because our host reboots the server regularly after patches and were not always there after thats happened.p  pDoes anyone have any idea on how to resolve this Weve googled high and low, but cant find anyone with the same problem.

Negative 2176 pI am trying to translate the a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsobjdetectcascadeclassifiercascadeclassifier.htmlcascadeclassifier relnofollowOpenCV CascadeClassifier tutoriala from C to Java.

Negative 2176 pIm having a hard time googling this issue because most of the things I can find are about animations that are supposed to be fast but are acting slow.

But the animation is very choppy.p  pBasically, it boils down to something like thisp  precodeelem.animate         left x,         top y , someLargeNumber codepre  pIm wondering if the problem is that the animation is so slow that each step is less than a pixel and so it is rounding them to either 0 or 1 making it appear to drop frames and then move all at once. But I dont know how I would check or fix this.p  pIs there a better way to be doing slow animations so theyre smooth I had a similar one created with CSS3 and translatex,y that was smooth but unfortunately I need more flexibility than I think I can get with CSS.p

Negative 2176 pAs someone who is very new to the opensource PBX projects like codeAsteriskcode and codeFreeSWITCHcode, I am grappling with some information overload. Have read the basic FreeSWITCH docs on Wiki, but still have few questions. Since I am not very familiar with the terminology, I will try to use close approximations.p  pTrying to create a smallminimalistic build of FreeSWITCH, that needs to run on an rather old laptop Celeron 1GHz, 512MB RAM, 20GB HDD, already running Debian Wheezy, and set it up as a 6port GSMSIPJabber gateway. So, by small and minimalistic, I mean one which doesnt have modulesoptionalsoftware that is not absolutely necessary e.g. no need for IVR announcements, or Skype integration  to keep memory footprint smallest, and occupy less harddisk realestate.p  pThe rough idea is to have 6 GSM ports via GSMopen module, similar to chandongle towards public telephony network, and about 60 SIP extension, and support upto 6 calls involving GSM ports, and about 6 SIPSIP calls intra PBX, on this setup. I have read that the CPU overhead of GSMopen module is pretty low, so I am guessing this is possible. p  ol liCan someone confirm this to be a realistic goalli liWhat might be the minimum set of modules to select for minimalistic buildli liFor modules not chosen during initial build, can those be added later If so, would it require me to rebuild FreeSWITCH completely, only the modules, or that everything would be built, but only configuration changes would be required to ensure that modules are loaded, and configureli liIs there any rough estimate of what might be the maximum callrate that could be supported in such a configuration For SIPSIP calls Given the underpowered processor, and little RAM as per modern standards, I am guessing that both shall be bottlenecks, but adding RAM might still be possible even if costly and difficult.li liI have read that hooks can be created using LuaPythonJava etc.. However if someone share share few examples of whatall is possible using such hooks, it would make the concept clearer. Can one hope to write an application like missed call log or redirect on no answer using these hooksli ol

Negative 2176 pi am somewhat blocked right now i wrote a quite complex Java Desktop App no AppletWeb App which has its own user Manual. This manual consists of some HTML and JPG files.

As soon as i create the deploy Version as a runable jar which gets wrapped into an .exe with launch4j the HTML Viewer is unable to display the user manual the Images are missing.p  pI do understand why this is happening, but i have no idea on how to fixcircumvent this.p  pMy application loads its ressources properties Files, Icons, etc. via getClass.getResource.

Negative 2176 pIve been searching all over for an answer to this question for a few days now, and while I have found most of the answer to my problem, theres still one piece of my code that is not working as it did before adding AJAX calls.p  pSome background  I am creating a web app to serve as an RPG character generator.  One of the first things that happens is I create jQuery UI spinner widgets to adjust stat scores.  On the stop event, my code runs a function that checks the current number against a switch case to set a value to how many points are added or subtracted from an initial pool PointBuy system, for anyone who knows about these thingsp  precodefunction calcPtsLeft           var ptssum  new Number         var ptsmax  new Numbermaxpoints.val          var pbstr  pointBuystrsc.val         var pbdex  pointBuydexsc.val         var pbcon  pointBuyconsc.val         var pbint  pointBuyintsc.val         var pbwis  pointBuywissc.val         var pbcha  pointBuychasc.val          var ptssum  pbstr  pbdex  pbcon  pbint  pbwis  pbcha          ptsleft  ptsmax  ptssum          ptsleft.valptsleft           calcPtsLeft codepre  pThis code functioned properly, up until I decided to use AJAX calls to dynamically load various pages into a content div.  After making the AJAX call to load my character generator, my widgets didnt show up at all.  I found that this was due to a delegation problem, so I collected all of my widget initialization into a functionp  precodefunction initGenWidgets   sets CSS for inputlabel items from jQuery UI set  slider inputtext, slider label, remaining inputtext, remaining label, charName, charAge     .addClassuispinner uispinnerinput     initialize jQuery UI button widget button.button  initialize jQuery UI radio buttonset widget genderbuttons.buttonset  initialize jQuery UI menu widget raceradio.menu  initialize jQuery UI vertical tabs chargen.tabs.addClassuitabsvertical uihelperclearfix  chargen li.removeClassuicornertop.addClassuicornerleft  initialize jQuery UI spinner widget for age charAge.spinner     icons          down uiiconminus,         up uiiconplus        initialize jQuery UI spinner widget for stats .statspinner.spinner         min  7,         max  18,         icons               down  uiiconminus,             up  uiiconplus         ,         stop functionevent, ui              calcPtsLeft                initialize jQuery UI slider widget for pointbuy allotment pointslider.slider         value 20,         min 15,         max 40,         step 5,         slide functionevent, ui              maxpoints.valui.value             calcPtsLeft                codepre  pI now make the AJAX call as followsp  precodefunction to load php files into content div function loadContentpage     content.loadpage gt , functionresponse, status             success initGenWidgets        nav links load files into content div .menulink.onclick, functione     e.preventDefault     loadContentthis.attrhref  codepre  pEverything seems to load fine, but when I test the widgets, it seems that my spinners no longer execute the codecalcPtsLeftcode function on stop.

Negative 2176 pI am searching for a way to create a combobox in jQuery Mobile, but there seems to be a lot of confusion between a combobox and a select dropdown box.  p  pMy definition, which I learned back when dinosaurs were using Windows 3.0, is that a select box allows you to choose from a dropdown list.  A combobox does this, but adds the ability to type anything at all a combo of a selection dropdown and a text input.  These days, from my searching, the distinction seems to have been lost, which is making it extremely difficult to track down info about true comboboxes.p  pI like jQuery Mobiles overall simplicity, and I love the autosearchcomplete feature that displays matching options as you type which is 90 of what I need, but I want to capture whatever the user enters, whether it is on the list of options or not.  Can I do this without headache  major work  another pluginp

Negative 2176 pI am programming a GUI in Matlab for an experiment where a test participant will view a series of images, and after each image, respond with a rating for the image.p  pI want to keep the window maximized at all times. An image will be displayed for a few seconds, then removed, some sliders will appear for the rating. Next, the sliders will be hidden, and a new image will appear, etc...p  pWhat Ive got so far starts out fine with a maximized figure window, right until I load an image and display it, using imshow or image command, which causes the figure window to resize and fit to the image, instead of staying maximized. If I then maximize the figure window again, it causes a noticeable flicker from the window frame having first been maximized, then resized, then maximized again  a flicker I would like to avoid.p  pHow can I keep the window maximized, and display an image at 11 ratio NOT scaled or resized to fit the maximized windowp  pI am aware of PsychToolbox, but it doesnt seem to have commands for creating sliders which I would use for the rating, and Id prefer not to have to do those from scratch. Ive also looked into windowAPI from Matlab File Exchange, but still havent found a solution.p  pBelow is an example of what I have now using Matlab R2013a on Windows 7 64bitp  precodescreenSize  get0,screensize screenWidth  screenSize3 screenHeight  screenSize4   Create figure window, keeping it invisible while adding UI controls, etc. hFig  figureName,APP,...

This is where Matlab decides to modify the figure window,  so it fits the image rather than staying maximized. hImshow  imshowimg sethImshow,Visible,off   Show the image sethImshow,Visible,on codepre  pThanks, Christianp

Negative 2176 pIf I have a conditional loop that should behave as if it starts part way through, what would be considered the best way to code this Is code including a codegotocode like the following snippet considered acceptablep  precodegoto firstitr do    doSomeStuff firstitr   doSomeOtherStuff  whilecondition codepre  pThe apparently less efficient alternative I can see is to introduce a flag and a conditional around codedoSomeStuffcode, producing the followingp  precodebool first  true do    iffirst     first  false   else     doSomeStuff   doSomeOtherStuff  whilecondition codepre  pThis is the approach I normally use in this situation. Can a compiler be relied upon to ameliorate this by effectively transforming it into the first snippetp  pOther alternatives I can think of that avoid the codegotocode and the conditional would involve duplicating code, but that seems like a worse code smell than a codegotocode.p  pAlso, would the answer be different if the loop is performance critical, with the overhead of an extra conditional noticeably reducing performancep

Negative 2176 pWe are currently using Entity Framework as an ORM across a few web applications, and until now, it has suited us well as all our data is stored in a single database. We are using the repository pattern, and have services the domain layer which use these, and return the EF entities directly to the ASP.NET MVC controllers.p  pHowever, a requirement has come up to utilise a 3rd party API through a web service which will give us extra information that relates to the user in our database. In our local User database, we will store an external ID which we can provide the to API to get additional information. There is quite a bit of information available, but for the sake of simplicity, one of them relates to the users company name, manager, room, job title, location etc. This information will be used in various places throughout our web apps  as opposed to being used in a single place.p  pSo my question is, where is the best place to populate and access this information As it is used in various places, its not really sensible to fetch it on an adhoc basis wherever we use in the web application  so it makes sense to return this additional data from the domain layer. p  pMy initial thought was just to create a wrapper model class which would contain the EF entity EFUser, and a new ApiUser class containing the new information  and when we get a user, we get the EFUser, and then get the additional info from the API, and populate the ApiUser object. However, whilst this would be fine for getting single users, it falls over when getting multiple users. We cant hit the API when getting a list of users.p  pMy second thought was just to add a singleton method to the EFUser entity which returns the ApiUser, and just populate it when needed. This solves the above problem as we only access it when we need it.p  pOr the final thought was to keep a local copy of the data in our database, and synchronise it with the API when the user logs in. This is minimal work as its just a synchronisation process  and we dont have the overhead of hitting the DB and API every time we want to get user information. However, these means storing the data in two places, and also means the data is out of date for any user that hasnt logged in for a while.p  pDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions on how best to handle this kind of scenariop

Negative 2176 pAfter reading the documentation about the a hrefhttpknockoutjs.comdocumentationobservables.html relnofollowsecond parameter in knockout applyBindinsa, I understand the reason behind itp  blockquote   pOptionally, you can pass a second parameter to define which part of   the document you want to search for databind attributes. For example,   ko.applyBindingsmyViewModel,   document.getElementByIdsomeElementId. This restricts the   activation to the element with ID someElementId and its descendants,   which is useful if you want to have multiple view models and associate   each with a different region of the page.p blockquote  pBut I have not seen anything about performance. My thoughts which are based on nothing are that it makes sense that ko bindings will work faster if to restring the binding not to the whole document, but to a small part of it.p  pSo does it make sense to use codeko.applyBindingsmyViewModel, someElementId[0]code emwithout having multiple view modelsem just for the sake of performance. I heard about Mr. Knuth, so it would be nice to refrain from optimization citation.p

Negative 2176 pI am designing a WPF application following MVVM pattern. But when it comes to multithreading issue, I find my knowledge quite limited. My question is exactly like the title can I create the codeViewModelcode objects in a worker thread p  pCurrently we are not using any dependency injection so I just create the ViewModel object in the constructor of the codeViewcode in UI thread I guess it is not the best practice. But now there is a problem we have one core class, lets call it codeCoreContextcode, from our legacy software which is responsible for many core tasks, Data Access Layer between our SW and database is one of them. Many of our codeViewModelcode hold one reference to codeCoreContextcode as data member. Unfortunately this class is not built threadsafe. When I create the codeViewModelcode instanceand hence the codeCoreContextcode instance in UI thread, it is guaranteed that codeCoreContextcode is only accessed in the owning thread. However, when it involves with some heavy database query, the UI becomes not responsive. p  pSo now I am wondering, is it possible to instantiate the codeViewModelcode hence the codeCoreContextcode instance in a nonUI thread so the UI can be responsive when the VMultimately the codeCoreContextcode is making heavy queryp

Negative 2176 pWe are building an infrastructure which features a Node.js server and Express.p  pIn the server, what is happening is as followp  ol liThe server accepts an incoming HTTP request from client.li liServer generates two files this operation can be relatively long, meaning also 0.1 seconds or soli liServer uploads the generated files 20200 KB each to an external CDNli liServer responds to client, and this includes the URI of the file on the CDNli ol  pCurrently the server is doing this sequentially for each request, and this works quite well NodeExpress can handle concurrent requests automatically. However, as we plan to grow, the number of concurrent requests may grow higher, and we believe it would be better for us to implement a queue for processing requests. Otherwise, we may risk having too many tasks running at the same time and too many open connections to the CDN. Responding to the client quickly is not a relevant thing.p  pWhat I was thinking about is to have a separate part in the Node server that contains ema fewem workers 23, but we will do tests to determine the correct number of simultaneous operations. So, the new flow would look something likep  ol liAfter accepting the request from the client, the server adds an operation to a queue.li liThere are 23 to be tested workers that take elements out of the queue and perform all the operations generate the files and upload them to the CDN.li liWhen the worker has processed the operation doesnt matter if it stays in the queue for a relatively long time, it notifies the Node server a callback, and the server responds to the client which has been waiting in the meanwhile.li ol  pWhat do you think of this approach Do you believe it is the correct onep  pMostly important, HOW could this be implemented in NodeExpressp  pThank you for your timep
Negative 2176 pWhen I program in Java, I have recently discovered the free unittesting tool Infinitest, and installed it as an Eclipse Plugin. The GUI is minimalistic and looks like this statusbar at bottom of picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyz2uy.png altscreenshot infinitestp  pThe bar is green when all tests pass, and it is red if tests fail.p  pIs there a similar tool that inserts a status bar into Eclipse like this, but works for unit tests written strongin Javascriptstrongp  pI would also be interested in solutions that work for any other language but can be adapted for javascript. And the test runner does not necessarily have to be an eclipse plugin. Im interested in having seamless workflow with instant feedback from the test runner just as in Infinitest.

Negative 2176 pI am having a pretty strange problem with a website I am messing around with, and I cant wrap my head around what may be going wrong. I am using PJAX on the site, and the have a div in my body with the id of codepagecontentscode.p  pThe code I am using to setup PJAX is as follows...p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function         document.pjaxa, pagecontents,              fragment pagecontents,             timeout 2000               ltscriptgt codepre  pI know that the setup is correct because I edited the PJAX file to fire an alert whenever it swapped out the content of my codepagecontentscode div, and I do see that alert when I would expect to i.e., on link clicks.p  pI have a navbar along the top a bootstrap navbar and I was initially having trouble keeping track of which navbar item would be marked as active.

Negative 2176 pthis is my first question, so please forgive me any violations against your policy. I want to have one global random number engine per thread, to which purpose Ive devised the following scheme Each thread I start gets a unique index from an atomic global int. There is a static vector of random engines, whose ith member is thought to be used by the thread with the index i. If the index if greater than the vector size elements are added to it in a synchronized manner. To prevent performance penalties, I check twice if the index is greater than the vector size once in an unsynced manner, and once more after locking the mutex. So far so good, but the following example fails with all sorts of errors heap corruption, mallocerrors, etc..p  precodeincludeltvectorgt includeltthreadgt includeltmutexgt includeltatomicgt includeltrandomgt includeltiostreamgt  using stdcout  stdatomicuint INDEXGEN stdvectorltstdmt19937gt RNDS float f  0.0f stdmutex m  class TestAThread  public TestAThread threadnullptr     cout ltlt Calling constructor TestAThreadn     thread  new stdthreadampTestAThreadrun, this   TestAThreadTestAThreadampamp source  threadsource.thread     source.thread  nullptr     cout ltlt Calling move constructor TestAThread.

Negative 2176 pI am still trying to decide on the Git workflow for our project. Its very confusing and somewhat hard to grasp. I am probably missing something obvious or doing it completely wrong. Here goes one of the scenarios that is happening pretty oftenp  h3Scenarioh3  ul licreate feature branch from master emalways stableemli lido some commit on feature branchli limaster gets new commits that strongfeature branch wants to usestrongli ul  h3Goalh3  pGoal is to have nice and tidy history on the master without commits with useless comments like fixes or wip. Those happens for people that are moving along multiple computers or just want to help with something from other team member.p  h3Old wayh3  pWe were doing codegit rebase originmastercode at this point in the past. However then it had to be followed by codegit pull rebasecode so it can be pushed without codeforcecode to remote. That was causing some havoc especially when that branch was shared with other people.p  h3New wayh3  pNow we are trying different approach and doing regular codegit merge originmastercode which creates ugly merge commit on feature branch, but its the fastest and usually painless route. However when feature branch is finished, nightmare begins again. We would like to use strongrebasestrong do squash those feature commits to  roughly 13 commits depending on complexity and especially we want to get rid of those merge commits that happened in the middle out of necessity.p  pThing is, that there are usually many conflicts that are sometimes rather painful to solve, especially when the changes to file are split in multiple commits. Solving conflict at one point in history usually creates another conflict for the next commit. Its somewhat hard to remember how was that file looking at that particular commit.p  pSo I am doing codegit rebase i onto ltfeaturebranchgt p originmastercode. I am not sure about that codepcode empreservemergesem. When use it, the commits before latest merge commits are just skipped. Its somewhat hard to me to understand what is happening there and why. Without codepcode its taking all commits from very beginning of the branch and even more conflicts happens.p  h3Ultimate goalh3  pEssentially what I would like to achieve is to take snapshop of the files made from all those commits in feature branch and just make one new commit from that. That would be probably achievable using diff to make patch and then apply that patch on the master. However all history is lost in there and if I would like to see who and when added this change, it would be practically impossible to find.p

Negative 2176 pI am a novice when it comes to SSIS and I am building a small package that will process roughly 12m rows and insert them into 2 tables parentchild. The source and destination is SQL Server.p  pMany calculations have to be performed with a lot of nested logic. I was wondering what the bestrecommended approach for this would be. My options as I see them are to either include the calculations into my source stored procedure using CASE WHEN statements, perform the logic and calculations in a derived column component or to perform all the calculations in a script component. I am leaning towards including all the logic and calculations in 1 script component for all the attributes as this would be easier for me to maintain when compared to the other 2 methods and I believe faster when compared to including the calculations in the source query. There are about 30 calculated columns. The maths and logic is simple but as I said the logic is nested.p  pWould this be correct or is there another component I should considerp  pThanksp
Negative 2176 pIm trying to understand where the shortcoming is here.  Does the SML Module system merely provide dependent types, similar to how Idris has extended the Haskell type system, or is there more going on than just the addition capability of dependent types  Information on the SML Module system in existing internet articles has either been hard to find or hard to understand for me.p  p Edit  There was some confusion about what Im really getting at with this question, and the confusion seems to stem from my confusion about the ML Module system I think due to the fact that I understood Functors in the Haskell way.  Dependent types was offered as an example of what could be different between the 2 type systems, but it turns out to have been a bad example since neither system supports such a thing at least not directly.p  pThe main goal of this question is for me to determine the differences in expression of concepts between the ML and Haskell type systems.  Which abstractionsconcepts cannot be represented in one that can be in another  Why would someone claim that MLs typesystem is more modernpowerful than Haskells, or vice versa.  Another way to think of this is where is one type system lacking where the other is notp  pThe reason Im interested in knowing this is due to my interest in architecting software systems and how different type systems make modularity and extensibility of the software easier or more difficult.  Ive been unimpressed with Object Oriented type systems from imperative languages, so Im now branching out and studying those offered by ML and Haskell as they are the first ones that interested me.p

I hope its clear what im trying to do. I dont have any idea how to begin with this or if its even possible. Thank you.    p

Negative 2176 pIm making an interpreter for my own programming language, as a hobby. My problem is nonascii characters are displayed incorrectly in the Windows CMD.

The letter codecode but on my PC I get codecode. I thought it was a codepage problem, the the code page Im using has the letter codecode. Then I tried a different font. Lucida Grande works. But in the Python interpreter the letter codecode is displayed in the default font.p  pI asked people on StackOverflow and someone said my program was itself probably compiled with the wrong encoding.

Negative 2176 pI would like to use Class.getConstructor because I dont know what instances I need until run time.p  pI have a class A with a constructor AType1. Type2 extends Type1. Now, when I invoke AType2, the compiler intuits that I am actually invoking the constructor AType1 because AType2 doesnt exist. However, when I call A.class.getConstructorType2.class, I get a run time error saying that constructor AType2 does not exist. I can understand why this is happening, but I still want to supply a parameter of a subtype, and for the runtime to intuit the constructor required...p  pI dont really know what type of constructor I will need at run time the simplified call to getConstructor above is only to indicate what is going on in my code and I dont know whether, for instance, I will be instantiating an object of a subclass of A, or using a parameter of a subclass of Type1 Type2, say, in the example. How do I get a similar thing to happen at run time as occurs at compile timep  pThanks for the help,p  pOwen.p

Negative 2176 pI have set up a small embedded linux that uses busybox.

Negative 2176 pI am facing a problem with storing arrays in structures, which are further written onto a file. p  ol liThe arrays are square matrices.li liThe arrays and the size n are stored in a structure. This structure is then stored in a filebinary file.li liThe size of this array is subject to input from the user during the run time.li liWhenever I read the structure from the file in the future, I want to recover all those elements which were saved as they wereI suspect that is why saving the array as int a has not worked.li ol  pThe problem is that the size of matrix can be variable and is subject to users choicewhich is, by the way, also stored in the structure and further onto file. I acknowledge that I can take the size of array to be large enough to accommodate any possible value of size, but that would be a wastage of space.  Further if I write every element of the array individually then it would be rather a hassle to handle each value individually. Reading a structure is better than reading many values individually. Of course, if I do this p  precodestruct attribs      int a[n][n], b[n][n], n  codepre  pthen it doesnt work. Is there a smarter way around my problem As for present I take a[][] and b[][] to be of size 20X20 each, while expected value is 4X4 to 9X9, and store the actual value in n so that only that part can be read easily when the structure is read.p

Negative 2176 pI do not know why it is so hard to find anything online walking me through what Im about to ask, but I cant, so here it isp  pI have read all about web services.  I know what they are and the point of them, but I cannot find any super helpful documentation on HOW they are used from the basic start.p  pMy case in point  I need to integrate UPS and FedEx package tracking into my software.  Just a simple Enter tracking number, then display all relevant tracking information.  Simple enough.  Except I discovered the only real way to do this is using their respective web services.  I am perfectly fine with that, except that I cannot find any real documentation on how to start using this web servicep  pStarting with UPS, I downloaded their APISDK.  It consisted of some documentation, some code examples, one .wsdl schema, and several .xsd schemas.  These I recognize as XML, and can see the structure theyre trying to portray.  However, I have no idea how to use these in Eclipse to replicate the code samples shown.  The code samples are accessing an actual imported API com.ups.blah.blah.blah, and then using the objects like TrackRequest, but there is no documentation on the inbetween part... in other words, how do I get to this point given these wsdl and xsd filesp  pCould someone please give me, or point me to, a crash course on this pivotal part that I cannot seem to find guidance on anywhere  I am a noob when it comes to dealing with web services, so please forgive my ignorancep

Negative 2176 pIve seen this scenario a hundred timesp  pThe developer needs to display some items. No functionality scrolling, selection etc. is required, really just display a bunch of stuff. The solution They use a codeListBoxcode, then write loads of XAML to remove all of its appearance and behaviour often forgetting something, leading to strange bugs.p  pMy question is Why not use an codeItemsControlcode, which does exactly that, take items from a list and put them on the window put, by default, into a codeStackPanelcode, although that can be changed Are there any concerns that I dont know about Is there a reason why using an codeItemsControlcode directly like this is not a good idea, or is this just a matter of people not knowing they can do thatp

Negative 2176 pI have a repository with a wiki full of over 80 pages. I want to render an index of all the wiki pages on the Jekyll GitHub Pages site for the project, as well as render each page on the site using a custom layout, and using the styles of the rest of the site.p  pTo do this, my first instinct was to use git submodules to include the pages from the wiki which GitHub exposes as a git repo in the Jekyll sites repo.

They arent named with a date, and they dont have any frontmatter, so Jekyll just ignores them.p  pTo get around this, I would normally just write a plugin to do what I wanted.

Negative 2176 pI am using an old 7.3 version of FreeBSD, so I cant use length, substr, index, or match arguments of codeexprcode command. I want to extract the fourth word from the commands output without a script. I actually can do this by using backticks, or a pipe, but Ill have to use a script, which only contains codeecho 4code. Thats kind of awkward. Which command would you suggest to use to parse an input string from another command I heard of codeawkcode and codesedcode, but Im unsure if they are those which I need.p

Negative 2176 pIm trying to create a simple binary to decimal converter for my CS class to get a little extra credit. We only use Java in my class, so Im making it on the Java platform. Ive set up a homepage to call my class methods from to make it easier for me when I have multiple classes for the lessons I learn in the CS class. Im calling my first method, stringSplit, which takes the binary value given as the argument, converts it to a String, then uses .substring to slice it up into each bit. It sets each bit to a variable to be later analyzed. Next, it runs through my bi2decFunctions method.

Negative 2176 pI am working on a program and uploads a shipping manifest to a the shippers website. When I try to upload, I get a nondescript error back from their server, and when checking with the shipper, they tell me that there is an issue with the SSL I am using. p  pIve spent quite a bit of time piecing together code that, from what I seem to understand, is supposed to work, but Im not making any progress. As far as I know everything else is fine with the upload, but there is a problem with my SSL certificatep  pIf I understand what this code is supposed to do correctly, I should get a certificate from the shippers website, which allows certification to my program for a space of time during which I can upload the data. Im really not sure that this is what my code is doing at all, but the only code examples I have seen show it something like this.p  pHeres my code with the URLs changedp  precode    This references a custom class that compiles the manifest Im going to upload     Dim StringToUpload As String  CompileManifestMyDate, UseTestDB      Dim webClient As New System.Net.WebClient     webClient.Credentials  System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials      From what I understand,      this is supposed to set up properties used in next section of code     System.Net.ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol  Net.SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3     System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback           AddressOf AcceptAllCertifications      I can see that this reaches the server,      but I dont know how it relates to the next section of code      that actually uploads the manifest     Dim ServerRequest As System.Net.WebRequest           System.Net.WebRequest.Createhttpswww.certify.someshippper.com443somefolder     Dim ServerResponse As System.Net.WebResponse     ServerResponse  ServerRequest.GetResponse     ServerResponse.Close      This code works for the upload of the manifest,      and it seems the above code is unrelated and does not use a SSL certificate.     When this code runs I get the same error back from the shippers server,      indicating an issue with my SSL, with or without the two sections of code above.     Dim StrResult As String       Dim WrappedString As String  TransmitPLD.WrapPldFileStringToUpload     This references a custom class that wraps the data to upload      in information from the shipper.

Negative 2176 pIn xcode 5, when creating a universal app, using storyboards I could create a separate storyboard for iPhone and iPad. This allowed me to add an extra tab into my iPad app tab bar controller if I had content specifically suited to the larger screen and I didnt want to present this content on the iPhonep  pIn the xcode 6 world, I know we can use individual storyboards, but if I created a universal app using a single resizable storyboard and I had a tab that I only wanted to display on an iPhone 6 and iPads how would I go about this Or would I still have to split my storyboards in this instances and not have the extra content on the iPhone 6 I appreciate that Apple are moving towards these flexibile widths, but there still might be instances where I only want specific pages available on devices above a particular size.p  pthanksp

Negative 2176 pI have a distributed wpf application that I am trying to find a good way to encrypt the connection string in the app.config. I have tried renaming the app.config to web.config and running the aspnetiisreg from the command line, that encrypts it but I later found out that only works for the user running the command, I have gotten code online that reads the connection string and encrypts the password and saves the app.config, and when running the application I can run a function that decrypts the password and saves it but that leaves a gaping whole that someone can locate the app.config and see the password when running the application, also you would have to know when the application is closed to go back to encrypt it. Can someone tell me the standard way to encrypt the password and decrypt at runtime with out having to write extra code on a WPF application. To note, I have migrated this application to enterprise library 5.0, the prev version was 1.0 and there was a way of putting the connectionstring in a separate file and encrypting and letting ent library or .net decrypt and not have to worry about it from their. what I was hoping for was a similiar way of just encrypting during build if possible an have .net decrypt without writing extra code for different casesp

Currently when a user signs into either my domain or its subdomain, the session does not cut across the other one. For example, my domain and subdomains are a hrefhttpjohn.com relnofollowhttpjohn.coma and a hrefhttpwww.john.com relnofollowhttpwww.john.coma.p  pWhen Logging into a hrefhttpjohn.com relnofollowhttpjohn.coma a session is created for me. I find that if I typed a hrefhttpwww.john.com relnofollowhttpwww.john.coma in my browser while the session is still active, the session is not maintained. Same applies vice versa.p  pAgain how do I configure my Liferay 6.1 application to enable SSO Single Sign On across my domain and subdomain.p  pThanksp

Making a style class for a Rectangle uses different CSS attributes codefxfillcode, codefxsmoothcode, codefxstrokecode, etc. whereas a RegionPane uses codefxbackgroundcolorcode, codefxbordercolorcode and doesnt even have the option of specifying codefxsmoothcode so I can not use one main style class for the candles AND the bars.p  pThe fact that BarChart uses StackPanes for bars leaves me with a couple questionsp  ul liWhy Is it for some weird performance reason that I do not understandli liIs the choice arbitrary and would another implementation that is roughly the same but uses Rectangles be just as goodli liThe color of the bars in BarChart are specified with the codefxbarfillcode attribute which is undocumented in the a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenedocfilescssref.html relnofollowJavaFX CSS Reference Guidea but furthermore I can not find anywhere in the OpenJFX source where this attribute is specified and looked for, how does this actually workli liIn the CandleStickChart implementation in Ensemble8 a hrefhttphg.openjdk.java.netopenjfx9devrtfilee4b36fdb7c26appssamplesEnsemble8srcsamplesjavaensemblesampleschartscandlestickCandle.java relnofollowCandle.javaa the individual candles very similar to the bars of a BarChart are actually Groups containing a Line for the wick and a Region for the candle itself.

Negative 2176 pI know that we use comparable function for sorting ArrayList of objects to sort according to a certain property of objects.

Negative 2176 pI hope my keywords describe my situation. Basically, Im working with SMC Sliding Mode Control in Simulink using simulink blocks and S Function blocks. Now, I want to use DE Differential Evolution algorithm, to determine the parameters of SMC that gives the best resluts. DE implemented by two m files, one of them contain a function for objective function this need by DE, and the other one contain the rest of DE algorithm, used to running. What I did, is that, I converted one m file, to s function because it need some variables from the Simulink Model, my question is that,  now I want to use the value of the objective function in the other m file DE algorithm to run the DE to make some iterations.

Negative 2176 pDisclaimer Im new to Java, Spring, and Spring Boot.p  pId like to have Spring Boot return a 404 when trying to POST to a URL that doesnt exist. However, right now its returning a 405, with an Allow header that only includes GET and HEAD. Is there a way to customize which HTTP methods are allowed so that I get a 404 Ive tried implementing a custom ErrorController, but that doesnt seem to work.p  pstrongTo be clearstrong this is when Im POSTing to a URL that shouldnt be matched by emanyem of my defined endpoints, e.g a hrefhttpexample.comsomebogusthing relnofollowhttpexample.comsomebogusthingap  pIf any more information is needed to diagnose this, Id be happy to provide it.

Negative 2176 pfollowing code gives me a construct like in the picturelink below. For instance I have one main group with 3 groups inside. Every group has a table with 3 columns and a minimum width of 200. If you resize the composite, the tables and groups resizes as well. But if the size is smaller than 200, there appears a scrollbar under every single table. In fact my intention was to see ONE scrollbar under the tables. Ive tried also a ScrolledCompositeLayer between maingroup and the smaller groups, but it didnt work. Can someone give me an example how can i create one scrollbar instead of 3p  pThanksp  ppicture a hrefhttpwww.bilderupload.eushow.phpfiled94e501432047327.jpg

Negative 2176 pI want to achieve a specific pattern with a codeRecyclerViewcode list by displaying a dynamic contact list based only on a single codeCardViewcode.p  pimg srchttpoi61.tinypic.comfvgugx.jpg altscreenshotp  pThe contact list can have several items in it. Like over 100. Every contact should be a single item and of course, all the area should be scrollable.p  pA solution would be to make a nonscrollabe codeListViewcode but the scroll would not be fluid as there are many items in the list.p  pAnother solution would be to create a custom codeCardViewcode item for the top, the middle and the bottom or even overlap all the codeCardViewcode items with a negative margin.p  pI am wondering if there are some better solutions working with the codeRecyclerViewcodep
Negative 2176 pUp until recently, this site functioned fine when translated in Google. Now, when translating a page, links dont workare changed, styles are ignored or overridden, the menu no longer works, scripts seem crippled and in general its a mess, with no apparent to me logical explanation.p  pa hrefhttpstage.ladottransit.comindexgt.html relnofollowhttpstage.ladottransit.comindexgt.htmlap  pClick translate and choose any language.p  pIn the translated page, if you click the menu button, and then click one of the list items, it should expand a submenu. It does not. Initially I had heard that using a hash link can cause this using JQuery for the nav, amongst other things, and this requires the list headers to link to codecode, so I changed those to codejavascriptcode, to no avail.p  pLazy loaded images never show up, even though inspecting the styles says they are displayed and at full opacity. As they are in a carousel, they are floated left and codeoverflowhiddencode. They also lay over the top of the page content so that none of it is clickable. I need to get this back to a state where it functions reasonably in other languages as soon as possible.p  pMy JS skills are pretty remedial, so if this comes down to a script conflict with something at Google, the odds that I will be able to suss it on my own are not great. Any direction would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 2176 pThis is a super common issue on here, but it seems to be the most arbitrary also. It seems that a million different things can cause it.p  pAfter running build after build in codeRELEASEcode mode on 64 bit VS2012, I now get a codeopencvcore249.dllcode is missing from your computer.p  pI have not changed my codePATHcode directory, Ive also not changed any properties of my program. I havent even changed any code.p  pAny ideas I restarted Visual Studio but to no avail. Also, it builds in codeRELEASEcode no problem it just wont run. It works perfectly in codeDEBUGcode, and another project using the exact same property sheet works no problem.p  pUPDATE Copying and pasting all the necessary DLLs to the target output directory solves the problem....but surely theres a better wayp

I then set constraints on the black and green boxs keeping there top and out side edges the same distance from the superview and there bottom edges the same distance from the red box. p  pThe aim is that the red box stays the same height and changes width with the device size and orientation, With the green and black changing height and width to fill half of the rest of the screen each and meet in the middle.p  pNow i have set constraints to keep the black and green the same distance from each other, and it worked as i wanted however i get warnings that the black and green boxes have ambiguous positions and widths.p  pThe only way i have come up with to get rid of the warnings is to place a label alpha set to 0 so it cant be seen that is constrained to the centre of the screen then set the black and green boxs contains based on the label. This works and is warning free but i am sure that this is not the best way around the issue.p  pSo the question is how do i do this with out errors and with out placing an unnecessary hidden label.p

Negative 2176 pI am going through the a hrefhttpmithril.js.orggettingstarted.html relnofollowMithril tutoriala and am having trouble understanding codem.withAttrcode.

But what is the purpose of the second half, codechecked task.donecode It seems like it is simply repeating the first half.p  p2 As I went through the tutorial, I wanted to add the functionality of persisting my Todos to a persistence layer. I created a save function, so that I could refactor the line that I referenced above into something likep  pcodeminput[typecheckbox],  onclick todo.vm.markAsDone.bindtodo.vm, taskcodep  pAnd in my viewmodel, I had the functionp  precodevm.markAsDone  functiontodo        m.withAttrchecked, todo.done, checked todo.done       todo.save      codepre  pBut this did not work I get an codeUncaught SyntaxError Unexpected token code error. I think the problem is that the event is not being properly bound to the codemarkAsDonecode function, so it doesnt understand the codecheckedcode attribute but Im not sure how to fix this problem if that even is the problem.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 2176 pIm trying to figure out how to properly close out my script thats supposed to start up a Django server running in a docker container boot2docker, on Mac OS X. Heres the pertinent code blockp  precodetry     initcode  subprocess.checkoutput.initdocker.sh, shellTrue     subprocess.call.startdockerdjango.sh, shellTrue except subprocess.CalledProcessError     try         subprocess.call.startdockerdjango.sh, shellTrue     except KeyboardInterrupt         return codepre  pWhere codestartdockerdjango.shcode takes care of setting the environment variables that docker needs and starts the server up. The script overall is supposed to know whether to do firsttime setup and initialization or simply start the container and server catching the CalledProcessError means that first time setup was already done and that the container and server can just be started up. The startup works fine, but when a user presses CtrlC to stop the server, the server stops normally but then apparently the process that started the server is still going. If I press return, then I can go back to the normal terminal command prompt. If I do any sort of shell command, like codelscode, then it will be carried out and then I can return to the terminal. I want to change the code so that, if a user presses CtrlC, then the server and the container that the server is running in will stop normally and then, afterward, stop the process and have the whole script exit. How can this be done I dont want to just kill or terminate the process upon KeyboardInterrupt, since then the server and container wont be able to stop normally but will be killed off abruptly. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I recently tried the following according to Padraic Cunninghams commentp  precodetry     initcode  subprocess.checkoutput.initdocker.sh, shellTrue     subprocess.call.startdockerdjango.sh, shellTrue except subprocess.CalledProcessError     try         startproc  subprocess.Popen.startdockerdjango.sh     except KeyboardInterrupt         startproc.sendsignalSIGTERM         startproc.wait         return codepre  pThis was my attempt to send a term to the server to shut down gracefully and then use wait to wait for the process codestartproccode to complete. This, however, results in just having the container and server end abruptly, something that I was trying to prevent. The same thing happens if I try SIGINT instead. What, if anything, am I doing wrong in this second approach I still want the same overall thing as before, which is having one single CtrlC end the container and server, then exit the script. p

Negative 2176 pI am using Spring Data Neo4j 3.3.1.RELEASE with Neo4j server 2.2.3.p  pMy problem is there are some nodes which are duplicates of my entities but has only the indexed property in it.p  pMy class looks something like thisp  precodeNodeEntity TypeAliasProduct public class Product      GraphId     private Long graphId     IndexedindexNameproductId, uniquetrue, indexTypeIndexType.SIMPLE     private String productId     private String productType     ...  codepre  pWhen a new node is created, I first check if there is an existing one and update it if it exists, otherwise create a new one.p  precodeProduct product  productRepository.findByProductIdproductId if product  null      product  new ProductproductId  ... productRepository.saveproduct codepre  pThe repository interface.p  precodepublic interface ProductRepository extends GraphRepositoryltProductgt      public Product findByProductIdString productId  codepre  pIn Neo4j, the entity is created to a node with all the properties. But some nodes also have a duplicate node which only contain the productId. The thing is this doesnt happen to all the nodes. As of now we have about 120,000 nodes and as much as 30 nodes have this duplicate. Every time we reingest the data there are duplicates. Right now we only have 2 duplicate nodes.p  pOne more thing, upon checking the duplicate nodes, it seems that they have a node ID in sequence which I think that they are created together when I save the entity.p  pEDIT Upon investigation, it seems that the unique constraint is not applied to the productId. The problem seems to be from Indexed annotation. If I used codeuniquecode and codeindexNamecode in the same annotation, only the codeindexNamecode is applied and not the constraint. Now if I use either codeindexNamecode or codeuniquecode SDN can create one of it and I must create the other via the Neo4j webconsole which is kind of annoying. I know that in SDN 4.x.x index maintenance will not be part of the code and should be handled externally. Is this something that we need to do now since SDN 3.3.x does not handle it correctlyp

Instead it is making panel 10 visible after panel 9 has been arrived at.

Negative 2176 pI have a WinForms .NET C OLTP application based on Oracle.p  pFrom our support environment we regularly experience loss of connectivity to the database, and a resulting minidump file is generated by what, i am not entirely certain of  apparently it does not cause the application to crash, but in order to actually do anything you have to close it and start it again.p  pAfter a many such minidumps have been created in the same directory, all of a sudden the minidumps starts getting rather strange file names, filenames that are apparently illegal on windows.p  pFor instance we have a file name like  minidumpdefaultpid20248tidx19AC20159183151.dmpp  pAnd yes the carriage return is PART of the file name.p  pWe discovered this because log4net watches the directory and all of a sudden starts to bark unhandled exceptiosn due to these invalid file names.p  pSo we are trying to figure out why the minidump is generated in the first place, but the question here is, can we somehow prevent the minidump from being generated with an invalid filename or otherwise control the naming processp  pSecondly, does anybody know why is it even possible to create invalid file names in the first placep  pstrongUpdatestrong For anyone looking at this trying to figure out why the dump files are created in the first place, our issue was that Windows was generating them when it was near running out of memory, but for some reason we wouldnt always get an OOMException. p

The problem is that this field is optional thus it may have text, it may not. Whenever it doesnt, the regex I listed above doesnt work properly, and the whole scanf operation fails for that line.

Negative 2176 pI am working on a Linux app, which needs to be able to handle large bursts of signals. Although the signal handlers will run fast I plan at most some thousands of cpu cycles, the signals will come in big bursts, and ideally I would completely disable signal masking even not themselfes, see SANODEFER in a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman2sigaction.2.html relnofollowsigactiona.p  pThus, I need to implement the signal handlers on a completely reentrant way. I think stdatomic would be an useful thing for the task, but I think, stdatomic was developed to handle threadbased race conditions, and not necessarily race problems coming from stacked on signal handlers.p
Negative 2176 pI have recently inherited a directory of ColdFusion code developed in Dreamweaver. After downloading the source from svn into a local development directory, I attempted to follow the instructions I found in several places online for Importing a Dreamweaver site into a project, using the Existing Folder as New Project option since it was never previously a CFBuilder project, just Dreamweaver, I assigned the CF Nature to the root in the Navigator window. However, when I attempt to drop the tree below the root, no files appear  and the little  arrow is even gone, as if there are no files. What should I be looking at here Obviously it lacks something that tells it all the files in the project. It is odd, because when I select the root of the directory where all the source files are ZZZ Master Website, it creates another directory INSIDE that directory, also called ZZZ Master Website. Thats where the .project and settings files show up. I feel like Im missing something.p  pFWIW, Im no CF guy  Im inheriting this because that resource is no longer available.

In my case it would be best to use a BalancingPool Router.p  pThe docs say if blocking operations are to occur in the workers then one should use a threadpoolexecutor rather than the default forkjoindispatcher.p  pI did not want to configure it in the Akka conf file so I think this would be the way to do it in codep  precode  val router  context.actorOfBalancingPool5.withDispatchermypinneddispatcher.propsProps[History], HistoryBalancingRouter codepre  pBut the docs say for a PinnedDispatcher p  blockquote   pThis dispatcher dedicates a unique thread for each actor using it   i.e. each actor will have its own thread pool with only one thread in   the pool.p      pMailboxes Any, creates one per Actorp blockquote  pWhereas for the BalancingPool it says workers share a single mailboxp  blockquote   pThe strongBalancingPoolstrong automatically uses a special BalancingDispatcher for   its routees  disregarding any dispatcher that is set on the the   routee Props object. This is needed in order to implement the   balancing semantics via sharing the same mailbox by all the routees.p      pWhile it is not possible to change the dispatcher used by the routees,   it is possible to fine tune the used executor. strongBy default the   forkjoindispatcher is usedstrong and can be configured as explained in   Dispatchers. strongIn situations where the routees are expected to perform   blocking operations it may be useful to replace it with a   threadpoolexecutor hinting the number of allocated threads   explicitlystrongp blockquote  pSo what is actually happening with mailboxes and threads herep  pIs my example a sane way to implement a BalancingPool using a threadpoolexecutorp

Negative 2176 pVectors are good for random access, but the key is just its position in the sequence, just a number. What about when you want the key itself be something more interesting, and you want fast random access For this the obvious candidate would seem to be a Map. In most Map examples the keys used are keywords with two dots at the front. Can I for example use a Vector as a key to a Map Or not so much can, but would this be an idiomatic thing to do And are there examples of this sort of thing out there In a way I am thinking in relational database terms, except the structure being kept in memory.  p

Negative 2176 pOk, so I want to be able to chain promises in order to make code synchronous. My problem is that depending on result of first http request I could either be wanting to send another or not. In case if I choose not to send another http request I dont need my second codethencode to do anything. But since my second codethencode doesnt know about all this and its hanging there anyway so I figured I need to return from first then some fake dummy promise.

Negative 2176 pIm working on a tool for data entry at my job where it basically takes a report ID number, opens a PDF to that page of that report, allows you to input the information and then saves it.p  pIm completely new to instantiating new processes in python this is the first time that Ive really tried to do it. so basically, I have a relevant functionp  precodedef getreportid     path  reportpathid     if not path         raise NameError     page  getpagepath, id     proc  subprocess.Popen[CProgram Files x86AdobeReader 11.0ReaderAcroRd32.exe, A, page.formatpage,                              path] codepre  pin order to open the report in Adobe Acrobat and be able to input information while the report is still open, I determined that I had to use codemultiprocessingcode. So, as a result, in the main loop of the program, where it iterates through data and gets the report ID, I have thisp  precodefor row in rows     print Opening report for .formatID     arg  ID     proc  Processtargetgetreport, argsarg,     proc.start      row[1]  rawinputEnter the desired value      rows.updateRowrow      while proc.isalive         pass codepre  pThis way, one can enter data without the program hanging on the codesubprocess.Popencode command. However, if it simply continues on to the next record without closing the Acrobat window that pops up, then it wont actually open the next report. Hence the codewhile proc.isalivecode, as it gives one a chance to close the window manually. Id emlikeem to kill the process immediately after enter is hit and the value entered, so it will go on and just open the next report with even less work. I tried several different things, ways to kill processes through the codepidcode using codeos.killcode I tried killing the subprocess, killing the process itself, killing both of them, and also tried using codesubprocess.callcode instead of codePopencode to see if it made a difference. p  pIt didnt.p  pWhat am I missing here How do I kill the process emandem close the window that it opened in Is this even possible Like I said, I have just about 0 experience with processes in python.
