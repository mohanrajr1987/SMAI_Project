Negative 2631 pIve built a screensaver for Leopard which utilises coreanimation.

Again, Im not doing anything fancy  just a simple fadein.p  pThe problem is that while the animation does happen its empainfulem to watch. Its jerky on my development machine which is a 3.06Ghz iMac with 4GB of RAM, and seems to chop the animation into 10 steps rather than showing a gradual change.p  pIt gets worse on the ppc macmini the screensaver is targeted for it refuses to even play the animation, generally tweening from the beginning of the animation 0 opacity to halfway 50 then completing.p  pIm relatively new to ObjectiveC and my experience is based on using garbagecollected environments, but I cant believe Im leaking enough memory at the point the screensaver starts to cause such problems.p  pAlso, Im quite sure its not a problem with the hardware. Ive tested the builtin screensavers which use coreanimation, and downloaded a few free CAbased for comparison, and they run without issue on both machines.p  pInformation is pretty thin on Google with regards to using CA in screensavers, or using CA in general for that matter, and advicetutorials on profilingtroubling screensavers seems to be nonexistant. So any help the community can provide would be well welcomedp  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pSeems as though implicit animations help smooth things out a little. Still kinda jerky, but not as bad as trying to animate everything with explicit animations as in my solution.p

Negative 2631 pI have been searching around for days to find an answer to this performance based issue.br After digging  the Internet so far I have learned that there are couple of ways to use the Enums in java, well documented in a hrefhttpjava.sun.comj2se1.5.0docsguidelanguageenums.htmlherea. Well, definitely as a starter one would like use Enums in a emswitchcaseem statement, which provides clarity and better understanding of the code. But on the other hand we have a emVisitor patternem style implementation of the Enums as well, which ensures type safety and extensibility, Discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions859563javaenumsandswitchstatementsthedefaultcaseherea.p  pHaving said that, and coming back to original idea behind this question, so far I have learned that if a switchcase construct is properly designed using Enums, which ensures that case values are not sparse, and that the Enum declaration is in the same compilation unit as the switchcase statement, the java compiler performs some optimisation on the produced bytecode by implementing such construct as a strongJump Tablestrong discussed in a hrefhttpforums.java.netjivethread.jspathreadID504herea and elsewhere as well on Suns website, to which I lost the link. Now, this definitely gives a boost to the performance compared to multiplenested ifelse construct.  p  pMy question is, how does java implement the visitor pattern based implementation of Enums in the resulting bytecode and what is the performance boost while compared to emswitchcaseem based implementation, if anyp  pAnd which type of implementation should I prefer, considering my Enums may grow in future and I am keen on performance as well. Currently, I have some 19 and odd constants in my Enum.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongbr I have a class that stores some information about variables of a game.

This doesnt seem overly efficient, but I suppose I could cache the contents of the dropdowns.p  pAlso, if all I have is methods that get data for a dropdown, should I just skip the service layer and go right to the repositoryp  pThe last part of my question  For the ToSelectList extension method, would it be possible to write one method for each table and use it generically even if some tables have different columns Id and Name versus Id and CampaignName.p  pForgive me if this is too general, Im just trying to avoid going down a deadend road  or one that will have a lot of potholes.p
Negative 2631 pIm looking to attempt to simplify address entry into a system where the city textbox has autosuggest initially populated by the users geolocation.  In the past it has seemed that autosuggesting the city name is prohibitively costly without knowing the provincestatecountry first but it doesnt make sense to require the user to enter the address backwards as we dont think about address information this way.  On the other hand, not autosuggesting the city name means we end up with all sorts of weird and wonderful entries for misspelled cities from around the world.p  pI was wondering if theres a service that I can query that would automatically respond with the most appropriate city names according to not only what the user enters in the textbox, but the location of that user based on the country and political boundary they fall withinp  pFor instance, if I am in Canada [as I am] and I enter Mi then Id be presented with all cities within Canada starting with Mi until it was determined that the information I was entering wasnt Canadian at which point, it would use the next most likely configured country based on our usage pattern  i.e. it would check the U.S. next, followed by Mexico and then other less likely destinations.  I can write all this myself if I had the database but I dont know where I can find one and my suspicion is that it would be less scalable than querying a preexisting service on the web.p

I can only close it. It is supposed to show an autocomplete table when clicked. If running from simulator it does leak some memory when i click on the search bar, but only for the first time, and it is from an nsurlconnection alloc which is released, both in the didFailWithError and in the connectionDidFinishLoading delegate methods. I already have a separate unanswered question about this problem.  p  pUPDATE2 There are some other leaks reported but the only code from my program is the call to codeUIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil, nilcode which is not very helpful in tracking it down.p

Negative 2631 pId like to design a JVM data structure JavaScala that can be used to represent and store the contents of arbitrary relational database tables.  The data structure should be fast not too gcintensive, cachefriendly and memory efficient, so larger tables can fit in RAM.p  pOne memoryefficient solution is to store each column separately in a primitive array, but Im worried about the cache friendliness because items in the same row are not stored together.  A row with N columns will incur N cache misses, no matter how narrow the columns.p  pAnother solution is to store each row in an object array where each element represents a field and is cast to the correct type on retrieval, but this requires storing numeric types in their boxed form, so its not very memoryefficient.  And its probably not that cache efficient either.p  pAnother solution is to layout each rows data into a byte array the same way real databases serialize their rows, using only as many bytes as necessary.  This is cachefriendly and memory efficient, but Im concerned about the cost of serializationdeserialization on every access.p  pWhats the best wayp
Negative 2631 pIf you poke around enough in Delphi internals, youll find something strange and apparently undocumented about TTypeInfo records generated by the compiler.  If the PTypeInfo points to a TTypeInfo record at address X, at codeX  4code youll find the next 4 bytes describe a pointer to X.  For examplep  precodeprocedure testinfo PTypeInfo var   addr cardinal   ptr PPointer begin   addr  cardinalinfo   writelnaddr , addr   decaddr, 4   ptr  PPointeraddr   addr  cardinalptr   writelnaddr , addr end codepre  pPass any legitimate PTypeInfo generated by the compiler into this routine, and itll output the same address twice.  Ive poked around in TypInfo.pas a little, but I dont see anything that mentions this identity pointer or what its there for.  Does anyone know why this is there  This appears to be true in every version of Delphi from at least D3 to D2010.p

Steinbacha on chat yes, and the answer you got seems to be correct. the cyclic header dependency is a problem. there might be other problems also, but the cyclic dependency is a big one. you dont need a full definition of a class in order to use T. so the usual breaking of the cycle is to just forwarddeclare a class, likep  precodeclass Player codepre  pthat tells the compiler that Player is a class, so you can use Player and Playeramp, and even declare member functions that return Player although you cant define such a function until Player class is fully defined  well as a concrete example, all thats needed for the CoreGameMatch class definition is a forward declaration of class Player. then in implementation file you can include player.h. if its needed for GameMatch implementation.  if you draw the files as little boxes and draw arrows to show includes, youll see that that gets rid of the cyclic dependency p  pemThis said, he explain that the answer I got is the correct one so Ill mark OJsemp

Negative 2631 pI need to convert genealogy files to and from the OpenGen XML file format.  Simple enough, I can write Java code to parse a particular file and output an OpenGen file.  If someone uses Java in their project, they can use our library.  If someone does not use Java in their project, they can either port our translating code or run our Java application externally.p  pSince this has to be a pretty common need, Im hoping theres a mechanism out there to make this easier.  The ideal solution is this, I can create a file which contains rulesmappings to translate between one file format and our format.  This mapping file is then distributed so that anyone else can use one of many libraries that can perform the translation using this mapping file.  This way, translating is much easier and now anyone can do translations within their languageplatform of choice.p  pI guess in our case, the mapping file would be a little complex in that there are at least hierarchies to deal with.  I guess further complicating things is that some genealogy file formats are binary...p  pDoes such a mechanism exist  Whats the best approachp

Negative 2631 pIm currently writing a simple webserver in C for a course Im doing. One requirement is for us to implement a thread pool to handle connections using pthreads.p  pI know how I would go about doing this roughlycalling accept in a main thread and passing the file descriptor to a freee thread, however my friend suggested an alternate method than the one I had in mind creating all my threads up front, and getting them all to loop forever on a call to accept. The idea being that accept will block all the idle threads and when a connection comes in, only giving the file descriptor to one. Then when a given thread is done with a connection it loops back around and blocks on a call to accept again. Using the call to accept as a semaphore essentially. This would simplify the implementation quite a bit he figures, as you wouldnt need to keep track of which threads are busy and which are ready for a connection. It would also be lower latency in theory, as the thread can immediately start executing.p  pMy question is, is this safe Im planning to implement it and try it out, but Im not ready yet and Im quite curious to know the answer. Ive searched on google and here on stackoverflow, but couldnt find anyone doing it this way. Is accept thread safe I assume there will be more overhead with this approach as you are running all your threads all the time, are the two approaches simply a simple memorylatency tradeoffp  pEdit Im unsure if this should be community wiki, apologies if it should be, I cant find the button Pp
Negative 2631 pOkay, so here is my question.  I have a 3 different models, People, Roles, Client, and Store.  Clients have many Stores and can also have many people.  Stores have many people.

Joe may be an assistant manager at one store and a manager at another store.  What I would like to be able to do is pull the correct roles by doing something like   preStore.find1.people.find1.rolespre would return assistant manager for example or  p  ppreStore.find2.people.find1.rolespre would return manager for example.

Negative 2631 pI have a XIB file in which I have a few UI elements. The resulting view is controlled by my own class derived from UIViewController. This one works fine, and viewDidLoad is called, when the XIB file gets loaded etc from the main application delegate.p  pHowever, in that XIB file I also have obviously some sub views. One of them is a UITableView. That one is being controlled by a custom class of mine derived from UITableViewController. Ive set the delegate, datasource outlets on the one side, the UITableViewController also has got the correct view property set. However, the viewDidLoad of the UITableViewController is NOT called when the surrounding view loads. p  pI think this because the main UIView  UIViewController pair does not really know about the subview. in the UIViewController viewDidLoad I can call the subviews viewDidLoad. However I am suspecting that this is not the intended usage. So what should I do insteadp  pWhat I was assuming was, that subviews loaded from a xib file all get the viewDidLoad message.p

Negative 2631 pIm working on a Tetristype HTML5 game and need to beef up a space optimization algorithm. Rectangular blocks of varying size need to be  added to the canvas in the most space efficient way.  I know how much space the block takes, I need to find the closest spot the block can be added with a fixed x coordinate the absolute closest spot is a nice to have.p  pIve implemented a version that searches using pixel by pixel value checking on the canvas that pushes down until it finds enough free space for the shape and then adds it.  This works slowly only if the space fills left to right the algorithm can safely assume if the first pixel column is safe then the entire block can be added.p  pI need to make this more robust, heres where I think this should go.p  pStoring a quad tree to represent the board state gives me a quicker way to identify where theres space.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOTTmf.gif altSearch Spacep  p4 nodes are stored for each level of depth each node is either 0 for completely empty, or 1 for has some stuff somewhere. Each progressive level of depth gives more and more information about the board.p  precodegivenboardstate, block width, block height calculate the largest grid space the block must span    a block which is 242x38 MUST span a 16x16 free space     based on 12 of smallest dimension the block width requires n consecutive free spaces    24216  15 find the first available 15x1 spaces in the board check the surrounding tiles at the next level of depth for collisions   check the surrounding tiles at the next level of depth for collisions... etc if theres a fit    draw the block    mark all affected nodes at all depths as filled codepre  pstrongWhat is the best javascript data structure to represent the gridstrongp  pThings Ive considered so farp  pA. Build a full codetreecode object with pointers to children and values and a set of methods to navigate it.  This would be intuitive and probably spaceefficient, but I suspect horribly slow. p  pB. Look at each grid as 4 bits and store the depths as hex arrays or objects.  If done by a person more clever than myself, this probably optimizes not just the storage but makes clever bit operations available to compare adjacent cells, turn blocks on and off, etc.  I imagine it would be incredibly fast, incredibly efficient, but its beyond my skills to build.p  pC. Store each depth in an array.  codeDepth[0][1,0,0,0] Depth[1][1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]code etc.  This is where Im headed at the moment.  Its not very space efficient and it probably wont be incredibly fast, but I think I can get my head around it.p  pTheres a practical limit to any structure to the number of depths the array to store availability of 4x4 spaces in my last approach is more than 65 thousand after which making the expensive call to check the last few pixels of image data from the canvas with a regular iterator is unavoidable.  p  pSo, A,B,C, otherp  pAs usual, all insights appreciated.p
Negative 2631 pIve made a class in both Java and C that allows me to perform SQL queries, as an example I have a method called Delete which accepts several parametersp  precodepublic static int DeleteString table, String column, String operand, Object value codepre  pI have the emvalueem as an Object type as I may want to delete rows based on String, Integers or booleans, this means the method is flexible enough to support the different types.

On the other hand if I keep it the way it is then there is a lot less code to be produced and maintained, it can manage any type of Delete statement in terms of data types and there only needs to be a few if statements to determine the type of object that was passed in via the parameter.p  pWhich is the best approach to follow from a objectorientated  best code practices point of viewp  pThanks for the informationp

Negative 2631 h2Loading process image file different between VS 2005 and VS 2010h2  pWe have a post build step which modifies patches some locations in the executable. The patching process loads the process in the memory using codeCreateProcesscode and reads its code segment memory using codeReadProcessMemorycode. Then a sequence code0x8D, 0x05, XX, XX, XX, XX, MAGICcode is searched in the memory, and the file is modified on the corresponding offset to contain a different code. The offset into the file is computed as the address of the instruction in the process memory space minus preferred load address of the exe. The exe is marked as BASE0x400000 DYNAMICBASENO FIXED no address randomization, no relocation. p  pThe works fine with executables produced with VS 2005, however it fails when the exe is built using VS 2010.

Negative 2631 pI am working on a project which needs to addupdate around 1 million urls daily. Some days are mostly updates and some days are mostly add and some days are mix. p  pSo, on every query there is need to look up uniqueness of url in url table. p  pHow look up for url can be made really fast because at the moment index is set at url column and it works good but in coming weeks RAM would not be enough if index are kept on same column and new records will be added in millions. p  pThats why I am looking for a solution so that when there will be 150 million urls in total then its look up should be fast. I am thinking of creating indexing on md5 but then worries about collision chances. A friend tipped me to calculate crc32 hash also and concatenate with md5 to make collision possibility to zero and store it in binary20 that way only 20 bytes would be taken as index instead of 255 currently varchar255 set as url column data type.p  pCurrently there are total around 50 million urls and with 8GB ram its working fine.p  pYesterday, I asked a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7391839urltextcompressionnotshorteningandstoringinmysqlurl text compression not shortening and storing in mysqla related to the same project.p  pstrong[Edit]strong I have thought of another solution of putting crc32 hash only in decimal form to speed up look up. And at application level porting a check on how many records are returned. If more than 1 record is returned then exact url should also be matched. That way collision would also be avoided while keep low load on RAM and disk space by storing 4 bytes for each row instead of 20 bytes md5crc32. What you sayp

Negative 2631 pEdit Quoting myself because I summarized the issue much better in one of the comments belowp  blockquote   pI have a condition that is true when the package is installed, but   not true when it is removed. I expected MSI to remember that it had   installed the conditional component and remove it with the uninstall,   but this is not the case. I am trying to find out A the proper way to   clean up this orphaned component, and B the best way to protect   against this problem in the future.p blockquote  pI guess my question boils down to, is it safe to just delete an orphaned featurecomponent after a product is uninstalled  And is there any way to check what, if anything, is still referencing a component that I believe to be an orphan  And how do I fix my installer to keep this from happening in the futurep  pWe have a wix project to install a library, Foo.  This installer puts copies of Foo.dll into the GAC, and a folder, codeProgram FilesReference AssembliesFooltversiongtcode by default.  The installer also adds two registry keys, one is a custom key which stores the path of the Foo folder for reuse in future installs, the other tells Visual Studio to include the full codeltversiongtcode folder path in its search for installed libraries so that Foo shows up in the Add References dialog.  Multiple versions of the Foo library can be installed on the machine at a time, each will be located in the appropriate codeltversiongtcode folder under Foo.p  pFoo 2.0.0 had a bug that slipped through testing, Foo 2.0.1 contained the bug fix, no other changes.  It was decided that since the bug fix was the only change, we would add a policy file to the GAC which would redirected references for Foo 2.0.0 to Foo 2.0.1.  This policy file was added to the installer as a new component inside of a new feature.  An upgrade tag was added to detect and remove Foo 2.0.0 when Foo 2.0.1 was installed.  The installation of the policy feature was made conditional on Foo 2.0.0 being detected.  Everything seemed to be working and Foo 2.0.1 was pushed out.p  pNow, a year later, we discover that we again missed noticing a bug, this time in the installer setup rather than the library code.  It turns out that when Foo 2.0.1 replaces 2.0.0, and is then uninstalled, the policy file is orphaned and remains in the GAC while all other files and keys are removed.  I have tested this on a clean install of windows virtual machines can be so useful and confirmed that the problem can be replicated, i.e. no additional references to the component have snuck in to cause it to stay behind.  p  pAll of this was originally done in WiX 3.0 but we have recently moved up to using WiX 3.5.  Our WiX code looks like thisp  precodeltProduct IdGuid 1 NameFoo v2.0.1 Language1033 Version2.0.1 ManufacturerMy Team UpgradeCodeGuid 2gt    ltPackage InstallerVersion300 Compressedyes gt    ltMedia Id1 Cabinetmedia1.cab EmbedCabyes gt    ltUpgrade IdGuid 2gt     ltUpgradeVersion Minimum2.0.0 Maximum2.0.0 IncludeMaximumyes IncludeMinimumyes OnlyDetectno PropertyUPGRADE2X0X0gtltUpgradeVersiongt   ltUpgradegt    ltProperty IdFOODIRgt     ltRegistrySearch IdFooPath Typedirectory RootHKLM KeySoftwareFoo NameInstallPathgtltRegistrySearchgt   ltPropertygt    ltDirectory IdTARGETDIR NameSourceDirgt     ltDirectory IdProgramFilesFoldergt       ltDirectory IdRefAssemb NameReference Assembliesgt         ltDirectory IdFOODIR NameFoogt           ltComponent IdFooLibPath GuidGuid 3gt             ltRegistryKey RootHKLM KeySoftwareFoo ActioncreateAndRemoveOnUninstallgt               ltRegistryValue NameInstallPath Typestring Value[FOODIR] KeyPathyesgtltRegistryValuegt             ltRegistryKeygt           ltComponentgt           ltDirectory IdFOOVERSION Namev2.0.1gt             ltComponent IdFooVSFile GuidGuid 4gt               ltFile IdFooDLL Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1Foo.dll KeyPathyesgtltFilegt             ltComponentgt             ltComponent IdFooVSRegKey GuidGuid 5gt               ltRegistryKey RootHKLM KeySOFTWAREMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv3.5AssemblyFoldersExFoo v2.0.1 ActioncreateAndRemoveOnUninstallgt                 ltRegistryValue Typestring Value[FOOVERSION] KeyPathyesgtltRegistryValuegt               ltRegistryKeygt             ltComponentgt             ltDirectory IdFOOGAC NameGACgt               ltComponent IdFooGAC GuidGuid 6gt                 ltFile IdFoo Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1Foo.dll KeyPathyes Assembly.netgtltFilegt               ltComponentgt               ltComponent IdFooPolicy2x0x1 GuidGuid 7gt                 ltFile IdFooPolicyDLL Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1policy.2.0.Foo.dll KeyPathyes Assembly.netgtltFilegt                 ltFile IdFooPolicyConfig Sourcesys.CURRENTDIR2.0.1policy.2.0.Foo.config CompanionFileFooPolicyDLLgtltFilegt               ltComponentgt             ltDirectorygt           ltDirectorygt         ltDirectorygt       ltDirectorygt     ltDirectorygt   ltDirectorygt    ltFeature IdProductFoo Level1gt        ltComponentRef IdFooGACgt        ltFeature IdFooVSSupport Level1gt         ltComponentRef IdFooLibPathgt         ltComponentRef IdFooVSFilegt         ltComponentRef IdFooVSRegKeygt       ltFeaturegt        ltFeature IdFooPolicyv2x0x1 Level0gt         ltComponentRef IdFooPolicy2x0x1gt         ltCondition Level1gtUPGRADE2X0X0ltConditiongt       ltFeaturegt    ltFeaturegt  ltProductgt codepre

Negative 2631 pI want to write something similar to an HTTP web proxy.

If I run this locally with ruby hello.rb, accesing slow will not interfere with accessing fast. However, if I deploy to Heroku, then suddenly, requests to fast will wait for requests to slow to finish up. I had thought that both locally and on Heroku, this app was running on singlethreaded Thin. I cannot understand why I get different behavior.p  pI am pretty new to all this. Why am I experiencing this inconsistent behavior What would be a good way to accomplish what I am trying to dop  pThanksp

Nowhere in our code do we use Reflection or anything that would be expected to invoke parameters at runtime  the exception must be referring to some internal classes from Microsoft.  Further, the stack trace only contains Microsoft code weve been unable to find any documentation for many of the classes in the stack trace itself i.e., System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.  How can we debug this kind of error  Is there a way to put breakpoints of some sort inside these internal Microsoft classes so that we can see what sorts of inputs are triggering this behaviourp

First, create the encryptor engine that we use for the actual          encrypting of the data.         AESEncryptorEngine engine  new AESEncryptorEngine key            Since we cannot guarantee that the data will be of an equal block          length we want to use a padding engine PKCS5 in this case.

But before doing so, lets calculate a hash on the data as well.          A digest provides a one way hash function to map a large amount          of data to a unique 20 byte value in the case of SHA1.         SHA1Digest digest  new SHA1Digest         digest.update data          byte[] hash  digest.getDigest           Now, write out all of the data and the hash to ensure that the          data was not modified in transit.         encryptor.write data          encryptor.write hash          encryptor.close         output.close           Now, the encrypted data is sitting in the ByteArrayOutputStream.

Does anyone have an idea of what may cause this behavior I am pretty new to support vector machines, so I might have overlooked something obvious.

Negative 2631 pI have a pair of C clientserver programs that communicate using a networkstream. Everything works fine as it is without compression. Now Id like to get the bandwidthusage down, so I want to use a compressing wrapperstream around my networkstream.p  pI have tried SharpZipLib, DotNetZip, Cs own GZipStream  but I can get none of them to work.p  pSharpZipLib has problems flushing, and applying the fix specified here a hrefhttpcommunity.sharpdevelop.netforumsp785522139.aspx relnofollowhttpcommunity.sharpdevelop.netforumsp785522139.aspxa results in an exception Header checksum illegal.p  pUsing DotNetZips DeflateStream results in a ZLibExceptionBad state invalid stored block lengthsp  pGZipStream gives me a System.IO.InvalidDataException stating The magic number in GZip header is not correct. Make sure you are passing in a GZip stream..p  pThe way Ive implemented it is that everytime an array of byte has to be sent by my framework, I create a new Compression stream wrapper around the existing networkstream, write the bytes to the compression stream, and then flush, close amp dispose it. This to make sure that each WriteMessagebyte[] blah uses its own stateindependent compressionstream that will be flushed immediately. Ive taken care to not let any of the streams close the original network stream.p  precode                using System.IO.Stream outputStream  CreateOutputStreamWrappernetworkStream                                      outputStream.WritemessageBytes, 0, messageBytes.Length                     outputStream.Flush                     outputStream.Close                     outputStream.Dispose                  codepre  pBasicly, my DecompressionStream is created as follows optionals commented outp  precodeprotected System.IO.Stream CreateInputStreamWrapperSystem.IO.Stream inInputStream          return new DeflateStreaminInputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress, true         return new BZip2InputStreaminInputStream, true         return new GZipStreaminInputStream, System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode.Decompress, true  codepre  pand started asp  precodeinputStream.BeginReadbuffer, 0, buffer.Length, new AsyncCallbackReceiveCallback, null codepre  pthen in the ReceiveCallback, the data is read, the stream is flushed, closed and disposedp  precode            Get received bytes count             var bytesRead  inputStream.EndReadar             inputStream.Flush             inputStream.Close             inputStream.Dispose codepre  pand immediately create a new inputStream by calling CreateInputStreamWrapper again.p  pSo whats going on  Since all compressionstream implementations are failing with errors that come down to theres an error in the datastream I have a hunch it must be me and my code. On the other hand, if I remove the compression and just use the networkstream theres no problem, which makes me think the problem must lie with the compressioncode.p  pDoes this sound familiar to anyone  And while were at it, does anyone know of any other compression stream implementations that are suited to wrap around a networkstream p
Negative 2631 pIm designing my own OO language and was happily going along until I hit exceptions. It seems to me that exceptions break encapsulation.p  pFor example, if class A has an object of class B, B has C, and C has X, which throws an exception to A, the code in A must not only know about X but also B and C to handle it correctly. You can tell this because if you replace C with D, A exceptions handler will have to change to extract the relevant information from the call stack.p  pThe only way I can think of around this problem is to have exceptions as part of the class API so that they propagate back up the calling stack one caller at a time. And they should reinterrupt the exception in their own terms.p  pHeres an example. Trend is a class for analyzing statistical trends and it has a method, slope, for calculating the slope of a line from two points.p  precodemethod slope     given         Point 1st         Point 2nd     returns         Number m     except         when infinite slope      m gets          2nds y  1sts y    2nds x  1sts x      except         when any divide by zero             declare infinite slope         when overflow of  2nds y  1sts y              declare infinite slope         when overflow of  2nds x  1sts x              instead do m gets 0         when overflow of  2nds y  1sts y    2nds x  1sts x              declare infinite slope         when any underflow             instead use 0  end of method slope codepre  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 2631 pStrictly in interest of saving typing in code, Id like to find some way to append text to members returned by another class. That probably doesnt make sense, so an example.

Maybe I could include the string literal in the getter, but even then Id have to call Path.CombineRootPath ... in each getter, which is far too much work for me. p  pSo, trying another approach, which wont work for reasons shown belowp  precodepublic class TestFiles      public class FileRelativePaths              private const string File1RelativePath  TestDataFile1.xml         private const string File2RelativePath  TestDataFile2.xml           private static FileRelativePaths relPaths  new RulePackages      FileRelativePaths FullPaths              get  return relPaths            private static string RootPath               No longer called, but somehow need to find a way to append to paths returned in FullPaths         return SomeDirectoryNameDeterminedAtRunTimeReturnedBySomeOtherModule          codepre  pThis almost works, I get the strong typing and a caller could get the files by p  precodeString FileToUseForTest  TestFiles.FullPaths.File1 codepre  pBut the problem is that this is giving me the relative paths only, where I really wanted to append some code to the strings returned by using the method RootPath.p  pSo, is there any way to get this to work, while still having strong typing and keeping the code length to a minimum Im a bit resigned to using the first approach above, but thought Id ask if there was a creative solution. p

Negative 2631 pI want to develop an RIA and I need to handle some computer hardware not already supported.

Negative 2631 pI am working on a web page which has a gridview control. I need the data to be transferred to .xls format. I am able to create the .xls file and transfer the data, but the problem is that I need the gridcells to be displayed in the background in the excel sheet.

Negative 2631 pFor some reason, every time I run my Android JUnit tests and then immediately rerun them, EclipseADT appears to rebuild the test project, then it reuploads and reinstalls the test apk.  Obviously this slows things down considerably.p  pI checked the projects bin directory, and the test project does appear to be rebuilt every time I rerun the tests even though no source files have changed.p  pIs this normal operation by design, or is there a way to prevent ADTEclipse from rebuilding the test project even when there are no code changes  I have build automatically unchecked.  I happen to be using Robotium, Scala, TreeShaker, and Infinitest in the test project if thats relevant.p
Negative 2631 pI have finally tracked down a bug that Ive been working on for the entire weekend, however I dont see a way to really solve it  in a clean way, that is.p  pThe situation is that I have a DGV control that is bound to a List of business objects.  One of the columns is NOT bound to the DataSource and I have wired up the CellParsing and CellFormatting events to handle the persistence of the data for this cell.  Ive basically circumvented the .net databinding and implemented my own poor version.  This was not intentional, its REALLY old code that had complicated parsing and formatting requirements and  I incorrectly implemented a solution based on an unbound column.  I now know the correct way to handle this and have since fixed my code, however Id still like to know how I could have solved the bug another way.p  pI handle the RowValidating event and do one final validation on the row as a whole to ensure everything is cool.  Of course if there is an issue I Cancel the validation and the row is not committed.  This all works fine when the user is editing and adding rows through UI interaction, but creates a problem when the DataSource is set.  The issue strongappearsstrong to be that CellFormatting is not called when the DGV updates its internal list and builds the rows, or at least its not called before the validating event is fired.  This results in the RowValidating handler pulling a null value from the Unbound column because CellFormatting hasnt been called and set the value yet.p  pI was refreshing my knowledge on the DGV and thought that handling the CellValueNeeded event may be the ticket but setting DataGridViewCellValueEventArgs.Value didnt trigger the CellFormatting event like I hoped it would.p  pIve been thinking about how to handle this situation and the only thing I have come up with is to detect when the validation is triggered from a UI event rather than the initial binding or bound list change.  Not only is this a hacky solution, but dont see how it could be done.p  pIve created a complete example application that will illustrate the problem.  Id be really curious to see how some of you would solve a problem like this.  Its likely that there is major design smell here.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Windows.Forms  public class Form1  Form      private ListltDomainModelgt

This is motivating because the classic book does not have yet an OO version p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3723716isthereamoremodernooversionofletsbuildacompilerIs there a more modern, OO version of quotLet39s Build a Compilerquotap  pThe book contains 15 chapters. The compiler is presented in an incremental manner Chapter I provides the boilerplate codes for the whole compiler, then each chapter adds some lines to the Pascal procedures of the precedent chapter. p  pI have already translated the first 2 chapters, each chapter as a package, each Pascal procedure as a static protected method in JAVA, the procedures of one chapter are gathered in a single class that extends the class translated from its precedent chapter. p  precodepackage td1 public class Cradle      protected final static char TABt     protected static char look      protected static void getChar throws IOException          lookchar System.in.read                  ...   package td2  public class Cradle extends td1.Cradle      protected static void factor throws IOException      ...       ...  codepre  pHowever, when I come to td3,  I have to update the factor of td2.Cradle, but I do not want to change in td2.Cradle the factor, because that will make the factor in td2 do more than it should have presented in td2.  I thought of extend td2.Cradle, however, it seems impossible to extend a static class. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10456561overrideaprotectedmethodandtrytocallitfromthesuperclassMy related question hereap  pMaybe should I change every static method to nonstatic one p  pI certainly need some design pattern here, any one can help I hope I was clear. In summary, this project incrementally presents more and more instructions for each procedure and I do hope to record the intermediate steps using some JAVA mechanism like inheritance.p  pThe Pascal code is the classic book is here a hrefhttpcompilers.iecc.comcrenshaw relnofollowLBCa. I feel attempted to use inheritance because p  ol liEach chapter callsadds a bit more lines to the procedures defined in precedent chaptersli liI hope to make my JAVA source code usable to everyone who wants to follow LBC step by step. So it is  not appropriate to use a single class to put in the final source code of the authors compiler. It is essential to split the codes by chapters and increment them gradually as Crenshaw did.   li ol  pMy actual solution is to keep the methods of tp1.Cradle as static. The methods in tp2.Cradle, tp3.Cradle, ... , until tp15.Cradle will be nonstatic, and they all emstatically importem tp1.Cradle. . Furthermore, for every  integer i greater than 2,  tp[i].Cradle emextendsem tp[i1].Cradle. p  pDont hesitate to tell me better solution.  p

Negative 2631 pIm having trouble generating random numbers that do not follow a discrete uniform distribution.p  pSo for example, say I have 5 numbers to keep it simple, a probability of number k being generated would be k15. k  1 to 5p  pMy idea is to generate a random number j using rand, and if this number j isp  p1  then number 1 is generatedp  p2 or 3  num 2p  p4 or 5 or 6  num 3p  p7 or 8 or 9 or 10  num 4p  p11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15  num 5p  pNow scale this to generating 110, 1100, 11000. Does this work the way I intend it to Ive constructed a loop that pretty much does this every time a number needs to be generated, I think its probably inefficient since it goes up until it finds the j number generated in one of the ranges... What could be a better way to do thisp  pEDIT or maybe create an array once with the proper numbers and then pull out with rand better solutionp

Negative 2631 pI have a test branch with commits a1, a2, a3, a4. I would like to take the changes to the master branch but only in one commit instead of four. So I did codepre git checkout master git merge Xtheirs test git rebase i a1 pre codep  pcodep  pre squash a4 squash a3 squash a2 pick a1 pre  pcodep  pSo on master branch I got a commit b1 that included changes from a1, a2, a3, a4. This worked fine, when done for the first time. Then I continued with my testing branch, adding commits a5, a6, a7, a8. I checked out to master and merged again  I had to resolve the conflicts which is weird because a5 is a continuation of a4 and therefore of b1 as well. Note that codegit diffcode on a4 and b1 did not output any differences. Then I tried to rebase from a5 and there were even more conflicts. p  pSo it looks that codegit rebasecode is not what I need. After joining the commits, git considers a4 and b1 as different commit objects with idifferent historyi and what is worse even idifferent position in the graph.ip  pI would like something likep  pre b0  b0         a1               a2               a3               a4  b1         a5               a6               a7               a8  b2            a9               ...  b3 pre  pIs that even possiblep  pNote, I could create a branch for every group of commits, i.e. one for a1, a2, a3, a4 then do the merge and rebase with master and create another branch from b1 for commits a5, a6, a7, a8 and then do the merge and rebase with master to get b2 and so on. But this is not what I want  it is not desirable to have one branch per day. I want to have only two branches  a test branch with all the commits and a master branch with a rougher granularity. So that when I push master, they would not see every little change I make.p

Negative 2631 pMany times I have seen  especially in jQuery  that a function can have multiple valid data types, lets say either a string or a function. Also, in my own code I sometimes have functions which can take one emorem several values. So I could call the function withp  precodemyFuncarg or myFunc[arg1, arg2, ...] codepre  pThis appears to be more flexible and also more convenient to type, but is this actually a good thingp  pBecause on the other hand, it is not explicitly stated what type the function is, and AFAIK then the JIT compiler cannot work as efficently. And often there has to be a type coercion of some type then, which can introduce an additional performance penalty.p  pSo, would it be better to emalwaysem write codemyFunc[arg]code even if there is only one object in the array Whats your take on this p

Negative 2631 pI am trying to build a recursive search function for a web service that returns a list of files and folders. I created the two methods so they act as recursive search, it first goes and gets the top level contents, then it adds any files to the fileList, and any sub folders to the subFoldersList. We pass in the access level in our case root and then the path which you want the information for. If any folders were found it then removes the top folder because it has begun the search for that folder. Then it calls the processDirectories method, which passes back to getFiles the new path location starting the process all over again. Right now for testing my folder structure is below. When it goes to add the second file profilepic.png to the list. I get an error Collection was modified enumeration operation may not execute.

Negative 2631 pI have an npm package that uses coffeescript source, which I want to precompile before codepackcode or codepublishcode. However, my prepublish script depends on coffeescript as a devDependency, but npm isnt installing it before running the prepublish action. I have to run codenpm installcode separately first, which seems wrong. The same issue exists if I try to codenpm installcode the source folder into a different project.p  pI suspect that Im doing it wrong, but the only other guidence Ive seen is to compile on install rather than publish. Id rather not do that, so Im hoping there are examples of prepublish compilation that I can crib from.p

Negative 2631 pLets say I have an interface that provides connection properties for a serverp  precodepublic interface ServerConfig      String getHostname      int getPort  codepre  pIs there any way to dynamically create an implementation class of said interface at runtime that would return values from some arbitrary source application arguments, system properties, external configuration file, etc.p  pMore specifically, lets say theres a code.propertiescode file with the following contentsp  precodehostname  localhost port  80 codepre  pand a methodp  precodeServerConfig fromFileString filename codepre  pCalling this method should return an instance of a dynamically generated implementation of codeServerConfigcode that would return values from the code.propertiescode file specified in the codefilenamecode argument.p  pClarificationp  pThe goal is to be able to add additional interfaces whose methods would return values specified in an external source i.e. a code.propertiescode file without manually implementing them each time. A simple solution would create implementations of interfaces that return property values that match those of the interface method name being called, i.e. calling codegetHostnamecode would return the value of the codehostnamecode property, calling codegetBlacode from some other interface would look for and return the value of the codeblacode property, etc.p

Negative 2631 pI found myself in the situation where I needed to close a window which I had subclassed from codeGtk.Windowcode. I was connecting the window.destroy event to close the window initially to codeGtk.mainquitcode for testing, but when I loaded the module into my main program, I couldnt do it that way, of course, without closing the main program. When I wrote a function, I stupidly called the codewindow.destroycode method which, stupid of me, resulted in a max recursion error. So, I decided to connect a deleteevent and then call the codewindow.destroycode which still recursed because as I learned a destroy event calls deleteevent. So, I connected the destroy event to a function and tried to callp  precodewindow.emitdeleteevent codepre  pwhich worked, but resulted in an error wanting another parameter. Researching, I learned it needed to be something like this from gtk2p  precodewindow.emitdeleteevent, gtk.gdk.Eventgtk.gdk.DELETE codepre  pI cant find codeGdkcode under codeGtkcode like I can find codegdkcode under codegtkcode. I dont like this. I imported Gdk and codeGdk.Eventcode is found, but no equivalent to the codegtk.gdk.DELETE variablecode. I did ap  precodel  dirGdk for i in l     if DELETE in i         printi codepre  pand came up with no DELETE variable defined in Gdk.p  pHow can we access Gdk from Gtk If not, how do we translate these gtk.gdk... things when they dont exist under Gdkp  pUltimately, I just didp  precodedel window codepre  pto do what I needed to do, but I still would like to know how to do the emit signal above in Gtk3 for learning purposes.p  pThanks,p  pNarniep

Negative 2631 pIve written an app that needs to get informed when a certain Bluetooth Low Energy device comes within range. If the BLE device gets noticed my app just stores a timestamp.p  pAs stated in the WWDC 2012 Core Bluetooth videos, there are two possibilities for apps for acting in background mode when working with Core Bluetoothp  blockquote   pstrongEvent Backgroundingstrongp      pEvent backgrounding is probably what most Apps   will use when interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy devices.  This   mode does not allow for direct communications to the accessory when   the App is in the background, but does provide for a notification from   the accessory when it wants to communicate with the app.  iOS will   stay connected to the BTLE accessory when your App is in the   background and will continue to monitor for notifications.  When the   connected BTLE accessory has a notification available, iOS will notify   the user that the accessory would like to talk to your App, allowing   the user to load your App and interact with the accessory.  As many   devices need to conserve power, only providing information at   deterministic times will greatly enhance the battery life of the   accessory and the iPhone 4S.p      ul   liNo info.plist entries are required for this mode.li   ul      pstrongSession Backgroundingstrongp      pThere are times where an App must interact with   an accessory even if it is running in the background.  Consider a   running app that needs to monitor heart rate realtime.  There is a   clear START and STOP to this model.  The user STARTS their run in the   App. While the run is active, the App reads heart rate information   until the run is completed or STOPPED.  Session backgrounding also   allows for scanning and connection to BTLE accessories while the App   is in the background.  A scanForPeripheralsWithServices or   connectPeripheral call will continue, even when the App is in the   background.  CoreBluetooth will continue to monitor for specific   peripherals or peripherals that match the services your App is looking   for and call your Apps delegate when found or connected.  Be mindful,   that every time a BTLE peripheral or iPhone 4S uses its radio, it is   depleting the respective devices available power.  App developers   using session based backgrounding must be mindful of power usage.p      ul   liSession backgrounding requires a backgrounding mode entry to UIBackgroundModes, bluetoothcentral, in your Apps info.plist.li   ul blockquote  pUntil now I Session Backgrounding with the according info.plist entry. The app asks iOS to retrieve all known devices and then gives the connect command to the device Im looking for. The connection callback comes even after minutes after my app was backgrounded.p  pBut the app gets suspended after  lets say  one hour. This means that the next time my app gets launched by the user, it cannot tell if there have been any sightings of the BLE device of interest.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong Is it possible for my app to get notified without user interaction even days after being sent to background when a certain BLE device comes in range so I can store my time stampp

Negative 2631 pI am fairly new to ipad and split view but quite familiar with iphone and core data.  And I am wondering now when to actually save any changes so that no changes get lost and saving the context is not called too often. p  pThe user selects an item from the master view which is then displayed in the detail view controller. Pretty similar to iPhone. But within a split view the detail view controller simply remains visible and is assigned a new detail item every time when a new one is selected by in the master. p  pQuestion In the meantime the user may have made changes to the detail item. When to save those To which event could I react  setDetailItem is a good place to save changes to the old detailItem before the new one is displied. Fine. But what is with changes to the very last item before the user quits the app p  pTo add some complexity to this I am running several split view controllers within a TabBar. So the user may switch from one tab bar to the next. I guess that codeviewWillDisappearcode may be suitable to control those events Should I save the last changes there too Is it called upon leaving the app toop

Negative 2631 h1Problem descriptionh1  pWe have a Hadoop cluster on which we store data which is serialized to bytes using a hrefhttpcode.google.compkryoKryoa a serialization framework. The Kryo version which we used to do this has been forked from the official release 2.21 to apply our own patches to issues we have experienced using Kryo. The current Kryo version 2.22 also fixes these issues, but with different solutions. As a result, we cannot just change the Kryo version we use, because this would mean that we would no longer be able to read the data which is already stored on our Hadoop cluster. To address this problem, we want to run a Hadoop job whichp  ol lireads the stored datali lideserializes the data stored with the old version of Kryoli liserializes the restored objects with the new version of Kryoli liwrites the new serialized representation back to our data storeli ol  pThe problem is that it is not trivial to use two different versions of the same class in one Java program more precisely, in a Hadoop jobs mapper class.p  h1Question in a nutshellh1  pHow is it possible to deserialize and serialize an object with two different versions of the same serialization framework in one Hadoop jobp  h1Relevant facts overviewh1  ul liWe have data stored on a Hadoop CDH4 cluster, serialized with a Kryo version 2.21.2ourpatchbranchli liWe want to have the data serialized with Kryo version 2.22, which is incompatible to our versionli liWe build our Hadoop job JARs with Apache Mavenli ul  h1Possible and impossible approachesh1  h21 Renaming packagesh2  pThe first approach which has come to our minds was to rename the packages in our own Kryo branch using the a hrefhttpmaven.apache.orgpluginsmavenshadepluginexamplesclassrelocation.html20relocation20functionality20of20the20Maven20Shade20pluginrelocation functionality of the Maven Shade plugina and release it with a different artifact ID so we could depend on both artifacts in our conversion job project. We would then instantiate one Kryo object of both the old and the new version and use the old one for deserialization and the new one for serializing the object again.p  pstrongProblemsstrongbr We dont use Kryo explicitly in Hadoop jobs, but rather access it through multiple layers of our own libraries. For each of these libraries, it would be necessary top  ol lirename involved packages andli licreate a release with a different group or artifact IDli ol  pTo make things even more messy, we also use Kryo serializers provided by other 3rd party libraries for which we would have to do the same thing.p  hr  h22 Using multiple class loadersh2  pThe second approach we came up with was to not depend on Kryo at all in the Maven project which contains the conversion job, but load the required classes from a JAR for each version, which is stored in Hadoops distributed cache.

Negative 2631 pWould it be good practicestyle to embed design pattern names into appropriate interface lets say if its a decorator design pattern have the abstract decorator be named codeIDecorateInterfaceNamecode or codeAbstractClassNameDecoratorcode if abstract class is used for the pattern. As example java IO classes use decorator pattern but name the Abstract Decorator class just codeFilterInputStreamcode instead of adding the pattern name somewhere in the name.

Negative 2631 pI have done a lot of searching and either the answer doesnt work or its not a good solution.  The solution of just putting a reference into the html likep  precodeltimg srchtmllocalhostcgibinfd.cgigt codepre  pHas two problems, one is the image will change and itll get cached.  I know that I can put a random parameter on the call and get around the problem, but the other problem is that the program runs for a few seconds.  I use javascript, setInterval, to loop.  The perl program reads an image file and annotates it.  This take a while, 3 or 4 seconds and the display blanks out during that time, so I have two divs, one is hidden while the other is being displayed.  The logic is that Ill load the hidden one with an image and when the load is complete, Ill hide the first and display the second, next pass, vice versa.  There seems to be no event I can trap at load completion.  None I saw in the debugger at any rate.  p  pThe ajax call brings in the data but I cant figure out how to display it.

Negative 2631 pI have a custom user database thats quite locked down.  I can only access it through stored procedures. I need to get this database to work with MVC so heres what I have so far.p  pA Repository that accesses a class that can manipulate the database. A Class that inherits ExtendedMembershipProvider and a class that inherits RoleProvider.p  pI now need to plug these Providers into MVC but this is where Im struggling.  p  pIf I create a new MVC4 project based on the Internet Application Template then everything seems to be geared around SimpleMembership.  I cant even see where in the web.config the providers are declared. I see the AccountController has a lot of references to the ModelState and WebSecurity but Im not sure where or how I tell these to use my providers.  As Im not using EF I also have my own User and Role Models.p  pIf I create a new MVC project based on the Basic template then I can see the providers in the web.config but there is no Account Controller so Im not sure how to properly create this.p  pAny pointers would be greatly appreciated. My aim is to be able to use all the usual [AllowAnonymous] [Authorize] etc.. tags in the controllers  IsAuthenticated, User.IsInRole etc.... in my Razor view files.p

Negative 2631 pAssume I have an codeltinputgtcode element on an HTML page. When I fill in a value, navigate forth to another page and navigate back, that value is usually restoredp  p1 In Firefox, the whole page state is being restored because of the BFCache a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWorkingwithBFCache relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWorkingwithBFCachea. That means even the state of a running script is being restored.p  p2 In Chrome, the fast page cache does not seem to work so the page is reset to the original state, but the values of the input fields are being retained.p  pNow if I add an codeltinputgtcode field dynamically by a script, in Firefox the value will still be restored because of the fact that everything is being in restored.p  pIn Chrome, however, the Javascript to create the codeltinputgtcode field has to run again, so that this input field appears as a brand new to the engine, meaning that no value is being restored.p  pSo my question is How to implement Chromes functionality 2 with dynamically generated codeltinputgtcodes or how to give Chrome a hint about the identity of an input field.p  pOne reason why I am interested in all this are the proposed custom elements a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghgwebcomponentsrawfiletipspeccustomindex.html relnofollowhttpsdvcs.w3.orghgwebcomponentsrawfiletipspeccustomindex.htmla. Using this or the polyfills at a hrefhttpsgithub.commozillawebcomponentsblobmastersrcdocument.register.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.commozillawebcomponentsblobmastersrcdocument.register.jsa or a hrefhttpsgithub.comPolymerCustomElements relnofollowhttpsgithub.comPolymerCustomElementsa means that one is going to create a lot of input elements programmatically and for a good user experience they should work as the builtin elements.p

So, in my mind, there will be two databases, but Im not sure if Im approaching it correctly.p  ol lipUsers  username, location, created content, comments, etc.p  precodeuser [              userID 12,         userUserName My Username,         userRealName My Real Name,         mainInterests [                              interest Guitar             ,                              interest Web Design             ,                              interest Hiking                      ],         userAbout All about me...,         userComments [                              comment this is a comment, contentID  12             ,                              comment this is another comment, contentID  123                       ],       ] codepreli lipCreated Content  title, description, username, comments, etc.p  precodemainItem [              mainID 1,         mainTitle Guitar Lessons,         mainCreatorUserName My Username,         mainCreatorRealName My Real Name,         mainTags [                              tag Intermediate             ,                              tag Acoustic             ,                              tag Guitar                      ],         mainAbout Learn guitar,          mainSeries [                              videoFile file.mov,                 thumbnail url.jpg,                 time 937,                 seriesNumber 1,                 title Learn Scales             ,                              videoFile file.mov,                 thumbnail url.jpg,                 time 812,                 seriesNumber 2,                 title Learn Chords                      ],         userComments [                              comment this is a comment, userID  12             ,                              comment this is another comment, userID  123                       ]      ] codepreli ol  pAnd there is more complexity than that, but I just would like to understand if Im approaching this right. Maybe Im even approaching this entirely incorrectly for instance, CRUD vs. REST Does it matter here As I understand it, REST implies that each of the objects above are resources with their own unique URI So would JSON rendered be impacted. I really am not sure. But ultimately, I need to use the JSON structure properly pull data into my frontend. Assumably, whatever said structure is will be mirrored and rendered in the backend.p  pEdit thank you guys for the replies. I think part of my question, where I clarify complex, is missing. So Id like to explain. I guess more than the JSON itself, I really mean the structure of the data. For instance, in my example, I am structuring my data to all be beneath two unique objects user and content. Is this correct Or should I think about my data more diverse For instance, technically I could have a comments database where each comment is the main object. Or is that still implied in my dataset Perhaps my question isnt even about JSON as much as it is the data structure which will happen to get rendered in JSON. Hopefully this clarifies what I mean by complexp  pAny and all help is appreciated.p

Negative 2631 h1strongIntrostrongh1  pGood evening guys,p  pI decided to create a topic for a script that create adaptive images. I have updated this topic so I can refer. Demand a more focused on a particular answer ChrisFerdinandi advised me to use the script a hrefhttpcferdinandi.github.ioadaptiveimagesindex.html relnofollowAdaptive Imagesa. This script would do exactly do what Im looking for.p  pSo I was looking for a script that checked me when the website is visited on a retina screen, like an iPad or iPhone for WordPress.p  h2strongProblemstrongh2  pOkay, now you know the background of my question, let get deeper into my question and finally discuss my problem.p  pI will explain at every step what I did and share my code. Before I share my code and walkthrough all steps, I will post some information about my WordPress installation. I have installed my WordPress installation in a subfolder called codewordpresscode. I am using a custom WP theme, that I have developed on my own. I use featured images for my portfolio items. I create them in my codefunction.phpcode file like codeaddimagesizethumbnailportfolio, 300, 200, truecodep  pAccording to the installation page of the plugin from Chris Ferdinandi, we start by changing the code.htaccesscode file in strongstep 1strong. So, what I did is past everything between the comments codeSTART AdaptiveImagescode and codeEND AdaptiveImagescode immediately after codeRewriteEngine Oncode. So my entire file would like thisp  precodeBEGIN WordPress ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On  START AdaptiveImages  Add any directories you wish to omit from the AdaptiveImages process on a new line. Omit plugins, wpincludes and wpadmin content. RewriteCond REQUESTURI wpcontentplugins RewriteCond REQUESTURI wpincludes RewriteCond REQUESTURI wpadmin  Send any GIF, JPG, or PNG request that IS NOT stored inside one of the above directories to adaptiveimages.php so we can select appropriately sized versions RewriteRule .jpeggifpng adaptiveimages.php  END AdaptiveImages  RewriteBase wordpress RewriteRule index.php  [L] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . wordpressindex.php [L] ltIfModulegt  END WordPress codepre  pOk, after modifying the code.htaccesscode file, I uploaded to the server. I update it inside the codewordpresscode subfolder. Fine thats done, lets go to strongstep 2.strong This step I have skipped because this was an optional option.p  pRight strongstep 3.strong I uploaded codeadaptiveimages.phpcode into the same directory as my code.htaccesscode file, for clarity I have both files uploaded in the subdir. codewordpresscode.p  pstrongStep 4.strong I add the cookie script right after the beginning codeltheadgtcode before all other scripts will run. My entire file looks like thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetUTF8 gt lttitlegtltphp bloginfoname gtltphp wptitle gtlttitlegt  lt Meta Tags gt ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1.0, widthdevicewidth gt  lt Stylesheets gt ltlink hrefltphp bloginfostylesheeturl gt relstylesheetgt ltlink hrefltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtcss960.css relstylesheetgt ltlink hrefltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtcssflexslider.css relstylesheetgt ltlink hrefltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtcssisotope.css relstylesheetgt  lt JavaScript gt ltscriptgt     document.cookieresolutionMath.maxscreen.width,screen.heightdevicePixelRatio in window  ,devicePixelRatio  ,1 path ltscriptgt  ltscript srcltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtjsjquery1.8.1.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript srcltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtjscustom.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtjsjquery.flexslider.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtjsjquery.isotope.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcltphp bloginfotemplatedirectory gtjsjquery.isotope.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltphp      Always have wphead just before the closing ltheadgt       tag of your theme, or you will break many plugins, which       generally use this hook to add elements to ltheadgt such       as styles, scripts, and meta tags.           wphead gt  ltheadgt codepre  pAllright thats also done. In strongstep 5.strong I have add the snippet of code to my css file. Okay, the last step. strongStep 6strong is testing all the stuff, here is probably the problem immediately clear. Since I have access to a mobile device retina, I decided first to look my site on that device. Unfortunately, only small resolution pictures shown, so that the image is not clear focus. I then looked as strongstep 6strong indicates that if there are really new images are created and storedsaved. There is an codeaicachecode folder created by the script codeadaptiveimages.phpcode, but this is unfortunately empty.p  pSomething to notice, is that I have set the featured image size to the normal size and not to the retina version. So code300x200code is for default view, for retina would be the size code600x400pxcode p  h2strongWhat have I donestrongh2  pI have checked the debug page of the script. I noticed that the cookie will be set as coderesolutioncode. When I replace the line codeRewriteRule .jpeggifpng adaptiveimages.phpcode in code.htaccesscode to codeRewriteRule .jpeggifpng test.pngcode all images will be override by that one. p  pError will be given after remove the comment before the error call. Every path is linking right. p  pI tried to change the permissions of the folder codeaicachecode from code755code to code777code with no results..p  pHope someone can help me out a.s.a.p ChrisFerdinandi Hope you have something about this update.p  pAlready thanks for your time and help.p  pCaspertp

Im also able to do this when I use Backbone ex. codemyCollection.url  todos.phpcode.  However, in every single tutorial, documentation, example code Ive looked at, the url for the collection is always set as a directory and the urlRoot is directoryid ex. codemyCollection.url  todoscode and codemyModel.urlRoot  todos5code.p  pMy question is how exactly is this managed  It seems a lot cleaner than the traditional way I was doing by adding GET parameters to my calls.  At first I thought this was routing, but that seems to be only related to setting browser history and stuff.  Some of the source code Ive looked at uses SLIM PHP and Rails neither of which  Ive used but I have no clue how any of the parts fit together.p
Negative 2631 pIm implementing a simple flipclock  counter  ticker widget which will consist of several instances of a following digit widgetp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combSFma.png altenter image description herep  pIts a digit placed on top of a background image. The digit is supposed to animate every second by sliding up and revealing next digit. During the animation both digits should stay within the backgrounds boundary.p  pIm trying to achieve this behavior by having a codeTextViewcode with 2 lines  one digit per line  and animating this codeTextViewcodes position upwards, until the next digit is fully visible. And then I will reset codeTextViewcodes position and replace both digits at the same time, so that its impossible to notice. Then I will repeat the process and make it look like the animation never ends.p  pHere you can see an intermediate state of the animation, when part of zero and part of nine is visible. I mocked it in the Graphical Layout editor of Eclipse, by setting the codelayoutmarginTopcode property to a negative value.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAnKpL.png altenter image description herep  pHeres the layout file the mentioned attribute is normally not there.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidth20dp     androidlayoutheight38dp     androidbackgrounddrawablebackgroundcountdownnormalgrey     androidclipChildrenfalse gt      ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidclipChildrenfalse         androidpaddingBottom5dp         androidpaddingTop5dp gt          ltTextView             androidididtextviewcountdowndigit             stylestyleTextView.CountdownDigit             androidlayoutmarginTop12dp             androidtext0n9 gt     ltLinearLayoutgt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pI tried two solutions. By using codeViewPropertyAnimatorcode on either codetranslateYcode or codeycode, I get a smooth animation, but the original clipping of the codeTextViewcode does not change during animation, so in effect the second digit is never visible. As you can see, I tried codeclipChildrencode property, but it doesnt seem to change anything.p  pMy second approach was to use codeValueAnimatorcode with a custom codeEvaluatorcode, which modifies the codetopMargincode of codeLayoutParamscode on the codeTextViewcode. It works, but the animation is very choppy even on highend devices.p  pSo my question is, stronghow to avoid view clipping during animation and make so in an efficient way Is there a better approachstrongp

Negative 2631 pHi there okay so my goal is to get the informationdata from my MySQL database and display it in my vb.net windows application. From the little I know, may be wrong but I dont think I should use the mysql connection straight from vb.net as this application will be used on multiple computers and networks which I will not have access to, plus they will not have static IP addresses. So I would like to know the best way to go about using PHP as the direct connection to the database and therefore the best way to output the data using PHP maybe json format and to then use that within the vb.net application to populate a datagridview.p  pThanks for any help..p

Negative 2631 pAt the moment I have a large JavaScript string Im attempting to write to a file, but in a different encoding ISO88591. I was hoping to use something like a hrefhttpsgithub.comdcneinerDownloadifydownloadifya. Downloadify only accepts normal JavaScript strings or base64 encoded strings. p  pBecause of this, Ive decided to compress my string using a hrefhttpstuk.github.iojszipJSZipa which generates a nicely base64 encoded string that can be passed to downloadify, and downloaded to my desktop. Huzzah The issue is that the string I compressed, of course, is still the wrong encoding. p  pLuckily JSZip can take a Uint8Array as data, instead of a string. So is there any way to convert a JavaScript string into a ISO88591 encoded string and store it in a Uint8Arrayp  pAlternatively, if Im approaching this all wrong, is there a better solution all together Is there a fancy JavaScript string class that can use different internal encodings p  pEdit To clarify, Im not pushing this string to a webpage so it wont automatically convert it for me. Im doing something like thisp  precodevar zip  new JSZip zip.filegenSave.txt, result  return zip.generatecompressionDEFLATE codepre  pAnd for this to make sense, I would need result to be in the proper encoding and JSZip only takes strings, arraybuffers, or uint8arrays.p  pstrongFinal Edit This was not a duplicate question because the result wasnt being displayed in the browser or transmitted to a server where the encoding could be changedstrongp  pThis turned out to be a little more obscure than I had thought, so I ended up rolling my own solution. Its not nearly as robust as a proper solution would be, but itll convert a JavaScript string into windows1252 encoding, and stick it in a Uint8Arrayp  precodevar enc  new stringtranscoderwindows1252 var tenc  enc.transcoderesult This is now a Uint8Array codepre  pYou can then either use it in the array like I didp  precodeMake this into a zip var zip  new JSZip    zip.filegenSave.txt, tenc    return zip.generatecompressionDEFLATE codepre  pOr convert it into a windows1252 encoded string using a hrefhttpscode.google.compstringencodingthis string encoding libraryap  precodevar string  TextDecoderwindows1252.decodetenc codepre  pTo use this function, either usep  precodeltscript srcwww.eu4editor.comstringtranscoder.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pOr include thisp  precodefunction stringtranscoder target       this.encodeList  encodings[target]     if this.encodeList  undefined          return undefined           Initialize the easy encodings     if target  windows1252          var i         for i  0x0 i lt 0x7F i              this.encodeList[i]  i                            for i  0xA0 i lt 0xFF i              this.encodeList[i]  i                  stringtranscoder.prototype.transcode  function inString        var res  new Uint8ArrayinString.length, i       for i  0 i lt inString.length i          var temp  inString.charCodeAti         var tempEncode  this.encodeList[temp]         if tempEncode  undefined              return undefined This encoding is messed up          else              res[i]  tempEncode                    return res   encodings        windows1252 0x20AC0x80, 0x201A0x82, 0x01920x83, 0x201E0x84, 0x20260x85, 0x20200x86, 0x20210x87, 0x02C60x88, 0x20300x89, 0x01600x8A, 0x20390x8B, 0x01520x8C, 0x017D0x8E, 0x20180x91, 0x20190x92, 0x201C0x93, 0x201D0x94, 0x20220x95, 0x20130x96, 0x20140x97, 0x02DC0x98, 0x21220x99, 0x01610x9A, 0x203A0x9B, 0x01530x9C, 0x017E0x9E, 0x01780x9F        codepre

Negative 2631 pwe are currently trying to create some very basic a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPersonaInmarketing relnofollowpersonasa based on our user data base few million profiles. The goal is to find out at this stage what the characteristics of our users are, for example what they look like and what they are looking for and to create several typical user profiles.p  pI believe the best way to achieve this would be to run a cluster analysis in order to find similarities among users.p  pThe big roadblock however is how to get there. We are tracking our data in a Hadoop environment and I am being told that this could be potentially achieved with our tools. p  pI have familiarised myself with the theory of the topic and know that it can be done for example in SPSS quite hard to use and limited to samples of large data sets.p  pThe big question Is it possible to perform a or different types of cluster analysis in a Hadoop environment and then visualise the results like in SPSS It is my understanding that we would need to run several types of analysis in order to find the best way to cluster the data, also when it comes to distance measurements of the clusters.p  pI have not found any information on the internet with regards to this, so I wonder if this is possible at all, without a major programming effort meaning literally implementing for example all the standard tools available in SPSS Dendrograms, the different result tables and cluster graphs etc..p  pAny input would be much appreaciated.

Negative 2631 pI have a web page with multiple links that contain a mediumsized image and a short descriptive text underneath. While all images have the same size for now, the text comes from a translation and may span a variable number of lines, depending on the text length.p  pMuch like in a toolbar, all links must have the same height. Especially the background hover highlighting must show the same height of all items, and of course the linksensitive area must match the background highlighting, thus the actual codeltagtcode element needs to have that height.p  pI know I could use JavaScript to determine the maximum height of the link items and apply it as fixed height to all of them. But Id try to avoid using JavaScript for that and rely on CSS only.p  pMy original attempt was to use tables for that and make the links expand to the entire row cell height, but that doesnt work has no effect.p  pSo heres something else without tables that also doesnt workp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltstylegt a      display inlineblock     height 100     background eeeeee     border dotted 1px red  ltstylegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltagt Line 1ltbrgt Line 2ltbrgt Line 3ltbrgt ltagt  ltagt Line 1ltbrgt ltagt  ltagt Line 1ltbrgt Line 2ltbrgt ltagt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Can you point me in the right direction on how to do this Thanks p

Negative 2631 pI am using JSSC, a serial library for Java, which internally contains a thread that periodically retrieves the ports status using FIONREAD, TIOCOUTQ and TIOCGICOUNT ioctls and invokes a custom method when a condition is met e.g. when there is at least one byte in the input queue.p  pEven though the connected serial port is continuously sending data w 115200 bps, the FIONREAD ioctl used to return the number of bytes available for reading returns a value of zero most of the time, before jumping to values such as 908 or 1020.p  pOddly enough, writeing to the serial port seems to fix this issue, in that the value seem to reflect the true size of the input queue afterwards.p  pAny suggestions what could be the source of this behavior I know there are a lot of flags and options when it comes to programming serial communication, most of which I am not familiar with. The relevant JNI JSSC code is a hrefhttpsgithub.comscream3rjavasimpleserialconnectorblob2.6.0srccppnixbasedjssc.cpp relnofollow titlejssc.cppherea.p  pThanksp

Negative 2631 pThis has been doing my head in for hours now. It seems so simple but i just cant find the answers.p  pBasically I have a MYSQL table of the following example data, NOTE there are other columns but are not necessary for this question.p  pre id  x   y   1   50  3 2   40  1 3   50  0 4   50  1 5   40  2 pre  pbr I want to order the table by x DESC and secondly y DESC.

But if using thats not the best solution, or how to use RANK please help. br br For the above data if my id variable id  4, its rank would be 2 as it is sorted second.

Negative 2631 pI have a set 2k  4k of small strings 36 characters and I want to cluster them. Since I use strings, previous answers on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8196371howclusteringworksespeciallystringclusteringHow clustering works, especially String clusteringa, informed me that a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLevenshteindistanceLevenshtein distancea is good to be used as a distance function for strings. Also, since I do not know in advance the number of clusters, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHierarchicalclusteringhierarchical clusteringa is the way to go and not kmeans. p  pAlthough I get the problem in its abstract form, I do not know what is the easier to way to actually do it. For example, is MATLAB or R a better choice for the actual implementation of hierarchical clustering with the custom function Levenshtein distance.  For both software, one may easily find a Levenshtein distance implementation. The clustering part seems harder. For example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3646169clusteringtextinmatlabClustering text in MATLABa calculates the distance array for all strings, but I cannot understand how to use the distance array to actually get the clustering.

Negative 2631 pThis may seem like a pointless question, but Ill ask it.p  pIn creating a DDL, I want to have all my relationships and extra information NAMED, so when the db throws an error its using MY name and not some autogenerated ID p  pthis is great for my relations and indexes, however Ive noticed that DB2 stores sequences, and it just names them... I cant seem to figure out how to name them in the create script  and going in AFTER creation to figure out what is what is not an option.p  pEXAMPLE p  precodeSEQUENCE MYSCHEMA.SQL131021121240860 is what DB2 named it when I created codepre  pWhat Id like to dop  precodeCREATE SEQUENCE MYSCHEMA.MYTABLESEQ START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 32767 0 0 CACHE 20 codepre  pIve tried this BEFORE the CREATE TABLE, and AFTER... but the sequences ALWAYS go in with this SQL131021121240.. namingp  pHere are the two ways Ive tried it....p  precode BEFORE, as my ERD software does... CREATE SEQUENCE MYSCHEMA.TESTSEQ START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 32767 0 0 CACHE 20  CREATE TABLE MYSCHEMA.TEST    ID SMALLINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY  START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1  NOT NULL,   NAME VARCHAR 255  NOT NULL,    CONSTRAINT MYSCHEMATESTPK PRIMARY KEY  ID   IN STORE16K    AFTER, as it makes sense to me, that the table has to exist first CREATE TABLE MYSCHEMA.TEST2    ID SMALLINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY  START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1  NOT NULL,   NAME VARCHAR 255  NOT NULL,    CONSTRAINT MYSCHEMATEST2PK PRIMARY KEY  ID   IN STORE16K CREATE SEQUENCE MYSCHEMA.TEST2SEQ START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 MINVALUE 1000 MAXVALUE 32767 0 0 CACHE 20 codepre  pIn both cases a sequence that is named by the DB shows up in the SEQUENCES folder....p  pcan it be done is there a reason NOT to do it, I just hate seeing labels like SQL131021121240860 showing up in diagrams and DDLs.... p  pIn doing some more reading, it appears as though I dont understand SEQUENCES, however I think my question is still relevant. Id still like to NAME them. p  pIm confused by the fact that sequences get automatically created on identity fields  the comments in this post  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1026936db2autogeneratedcolumngeneratedalwaysprosandconsoversequenceDB2 Auto generated Column  GENERATED ALWAYS pros and cons over sequencea  make it seem as thou its an eitheror proposition to use generated identity or sequences  but the behavior of CREATE TABLE with a single column  as identity DOES create a sequence...NOT ONLY that but it appears as though its a 11  which may be needed for identity, and its most likely that a defined sequence can be used by other things.. I get that they are not bound to tables specifically....p  peither way  my question of HOW to NAME them, instead of letting the DB name this is still my point.p  pThxp

Debugging shows the validation test and return working as coded, so the advice Im seeking is to get confirmation of the right approach. Sharing a simple working example would be great.p

Ive also been told our platform does not support reentrancy.p  pIm trying to resolve this error by preventing the linking of codemallocr.ocode from within codelibc.acode.

Negative 2631 pI would like to know if there is a way within OAuth to limit the data a user can see once the token has been accessed.  For example, in the photo sharing sample where one application contains a list of photos and another application wants access to the photos for printing purposes.  How can the user indicate the photo print service should see a subset of the photos  Maybe I only want the printing service to see photos with a .jpg extension, or photos with after a certain date, or with a certain tag.  Where can additional authorization requirements be populatedbr I have a java application and we are using Spring Security OAuth2 and hopefully we can accomplish this.p  pThanksp

Negative 2631 pI am exporting UML diagrams in Open Office Draw using Java UNO Runtime Reference Api in Open Office. Initially I tried to connect Open Office using Bootstrap.bootstrap method but it resulted in No office executable found exception. Then according to the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14157644noofficeexecutablefoundexceptionwhileconnectingtoopenofficethroughjavaNo office executable found exception while connecting to OpenOffice through Javaa , I downloaded bootstrapconnector.jar and it worked fine for me. But in this case the user has to provide the path of the of the Open Office installation and my requirement is to connect to the Open Office instance by programmatically finding the installation path. One method I know is by means of working with WinRegistry but in this case I think that the registry key may change with underlying OS. Therefore it would be a great help if someone can suggest me some other method of achieving this. p

Negative 2631 pI have been racking my brain trying to solve this problem, so any ideas or advice would be GREATLY appreciatedp  pI am building a store for an upholstery company who make custom upholstered bed heads etc. There are 300 fabrics to choose from, which is fine  I have added all 300 fabrics and their swatches as an option.p  pMy problem is 300 swatches makes for a very long and messy product page  I need to be able to sort these fabrics by colour, range and fabric type and by any combination of those. eg blue linen premium fabrics. Basically the same as this site a hrefhttpwww.heatherlydesign.com.auproductastor relnofollowhttpwww.heatherlydesign.com.auproductastorap  pWhat I was trying to do was add 3 extra columns to the catalog  options section, to assign a colour, range and fabric type category to each fabric, as pictured belowp  pa hrefhttpwww.marketingmaintenance.com.auwebimagesss2.jpg relnofollowExtra Columns in Options sectionap  pMy hope was to add these three fields as tags or categories to each fabric option, so I could sort by hiding and showing them through javascript on the product page.p  pMy PHP knowledge is pretty limited, I mean I can add things to a database and stuff, but editing all the required OC files is a bit beyond mep  pI have searched the entire internet P and I cannot find any extensions or info on how I would do this. Was hoping to find an extension that adds a column to the main options section not the options tab when editing a product and reverse engineer it, but no luckp  pAny help would be amazing... this has been stressing me out all week. Alternatively, if anyone has any ideas on how else I might go about making the options sortable that would be so awesome.p  pThanks for your timep  pJoshp

Negative 2631 pIve had an app on the app store for about a month and then I recently uploaded an updated binary to the App Store, version 2.0. It uses SpriteKit and ever since that update every person who downloaded it got a crash upon startup this was apparent in the customer reviews. So I went back through my code and realized that I forgot to change one of the code signing options to Distribution instead of developer. After archiving that new binary, 2.1, and waiting ANOTHER week to have it released again, version 2.1 crashed as well. My app has been down for 2 weeks now and Im fed up with this. I made very minor changes including a line of code in the AppDelegate.m that allows the user to play their own music in the background p  ul liBOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions  [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategoryAVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient errornil] return YES li ul  pI am not super comfortable with Xcode and it is my first app. I get this crash report in iTunes Connectp  precode        Incident Identifier A0DB04E6A62B46AB8896CE77A91064EF         Hardware Model      iPhone5,3         Process

Negative 2631 pAfter having problems getting a Razor View to render a ViewModel with an embedded IEnumerable I came across the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9915395viewmodelienumerablepropertyiscomingbacknullnotbindingfrompostme99154779915477View Model IEnumerableltgt property is coming back null not binding from post methodap  pI implemented the suggested solution using an editor template but my View was only displaying the first property in the embedded Ienumerable. I implemented both solutions from the above post but the one with the EditorFor template is not working for me. My view displays only the ID property. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas why the soution with the editor template may not be working for my setup I have implemented it exactly as suggested.p
Negative 2631 pI need to work with a REST service build with an JAXRS implementation in an heterogeneous environment, so I wondered how the abstractions of programming languages are converted to the real restful endpoints. I think most aspects are clear, but when it comes to asynchronous communications in REST I know several possibilities keeping the connection open, returning a resource that can constantly be queried, chunked messages or the client transmits a callback resource.p  pMy approach was to read the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comotnpubjcpjaxrs20frspecjsr339jaxrs2.0finalspec.pdf relnofollowJAXRS 2.0 Specificationa, but I think there is actually little stated about the REST implementation of asynchronous requests. Then I read the a hrefhttpsjersey.java.netdocumentationlatestasync.html relnofollowJersey documentationa and came to the conclusion that the JAXRS implementations just keep the connection open for as long as the processing needs. So with asynchronous JAXRS just refers to the blocking of methods on the serverclient side and does not use any special behavior of REST. My first question Is my analysis correctp  pIf this is the case, I have two new questionsp  ul liIs this really compliant to the REST paradigm in respect to the stateless constraintli liConsidering the longrunning processes that maybe work for days, is an open connection eventually automatically closed e.g. by the OS or by a TCP timerli ul  pThanks in advance p

Negative 2631 pI am trying to make a split background from the top right corner to the bottom left corner with dynamic width... My first thought is to use gradients and color stops to split the container background and this works, however, my goal is to have the line that is created by the gradient go from corner to corner with a dynamic container width and fixed height.

However, when I do refresh the page the same ghost imgs and its delete buttons are showing up again.p  pWhen I checked the AngularJS chrome extension for the scope models, it was showing that the outermost img the img that is to the right of the inbetween ghost imgs is taking over the deleted images, meaning the deleted images are getting set with the same name, id, and other attributes of the outer most img object. Once again, according to the chrome extension the array elements are not removed but only replaced. Once I refresh though it goes back to the same issue I had before of null element in array. This is weird because in my Firebase dashboard it shows that the imgs are indeed deleted however it does not reflect on my view until the outer most img is deleted. Below is a view of my Firebase dashboard and index. Only when the img 24 is deleted does the changes actually apply. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGoa6O.png altenter image description herep  hr  pEDIT2 As referenced by katowulf in this article a hrefhttpswww.firebase.comblog20140428bestpracticesarraysinfirebase.html relnofollowhttpswww.firebase.comblog20140428bestpracticesarraysinfirebase.htmla, I am having the exact problem he describes in the Good Use Cases for Storing Data in Arrays section.

This code intends to take an input, make sure its either y or n and then set a variable controling the initial while loop to false if the input is n. Somehow, as loop runs again, no matter what I do, the input it set back to y  Ive checked using print statements and it definitely gets correctly set to n but if I print the value again immediately after the while loop somehow it is y. The while loop runs again regardless of input. How can I fix it so n correctly exits the loopp  precoderestart  y while restart[0] not in n, N     def playagain        print         restart  inputEnter y to play again or n to quit         print         try              x  strrestart        except ValueError             print Please enter y or n.             print              playagain        else             if strrestart  y and strrestart  n                 print Please enter y or n.                 print                  playagain     game     playagain codepre

Negative 2631 pFor purposes of this question, let us call a list of mutually incompatible options for OptionS. I have a list of such OptionS, where each Option, apart from disqualifying all other Options in its own OptionS list, also disqualify some Options from the other OptionS lists. These rules are symmetrical, so if A forbids B, B forbids A.p  pI want to pick exactly one Option from each list, such that no Options disqualify each other. There are too many Options and OptionS and too few disqualifications in each step to brute force a backtracking solution.p  pIt reminds be a bit of Sudoku, but it is not an exact analog. From certain external factors, I have a rough likelihood for the different Options, or at least an ordering.p  pIs there a known better solution to this problem Is it in NPp  pCurrently, I plan to just take random paths through the solution space, weighted by likelihood. A sort of simulated annealing.p  pstrongEDIT  Clarificationstrongp  ul liI have a number, lets say between 5 and 500, of vectors.li liEach vector contains a number, between 10 and 10000, of elementsli liEach element rules out a number of elements in the other vectorsli liThis relation is symmetricli liI want to pick exactly one element from each vector in a way that no elements disqualify each otherli ul  pIf there is no way to choose one from each vector, I want to at least choose as many as possible. The nature of the data is such that there will always be at least one and at most a few solution or almostsolution  with just a few misses.p  pI cannot share the real data, but an example would be that the elements are integers between 1 and 10e9 and that only elements whose pairwise sum has more than P prime factors are allowed. Some numbers are more likely than others to fit other numbers, since larger numbers tend to have more factors, which makes some choices more likely just like the real one. p  pPick P and the sizes and number of vectors as needed to make it suitably challenging . p  pstrongMy naive solutionstrongp  ul liI order the elements by how many other elements they rule out and try those who rule out few first because that gives you a larger chance to be able to pick one from each.li liThen I order the vectors by how many elements the best element rules out. Vectors that rule out many other elements are first. So the most constrained vector is tried first, even though the least constrained elements of that vector are tried first.li liI then search depth firstli ul  pThe problem with this approach is that if the first choice is wrong, then the depth first search will never have time to reach the next choice.p  pA better way, which I try to explain in a comment below, would be to score each partial choice node in the search tree of elements according to how many you have chosen and how many elements are left. Then I could look deeper in the highest scoring node at each step, so the first choice is less rigid.p  pA similar way, which I might try first because it is slightly easier, is to do simulated annealing and take random paths, weighted by how many possibilities they keep, down the tree.p

Since only one codeEditTextcode at a time can ever be focused for editing, Im thinking I can subclass codeListViewcode to provide an interface which, if ChoiceMode is single, will give the Rect of the selected Item and bitmaps of the codeListViewcode regions above and below the selected item. This could then be used to temporarily overlay the codeListViewcode with a vertical codeLinearLayoutcode containing the above bitmap, an active codeFlaggedEditTextcode and the below bitmap.  p  pIn this way, the codeFlaggedEditTextcode widgets can effectively act as nonfocusable codeEditTextcodes in the codeListViewcode, but when an Item is selected, interaction is with the temporary overlay.br The above and below bitmaps could also easily be tinted to suggest inactivity.p  pstrongAdditionalstrongbr In fact, Ive just realized I probably dont even need the Rect of the selected Item from the interface. The above and below bitmaps and a codeFlaggedEditTextcode using the same codeLayoutParamscode as per the codeListViewcode should be enough.  p
Negative 2631 pI have a need to use distributed locking in my project. I am considering Zookeeper  Curator for this. During my investigations, I found that these two frameworks can solve for most of my project needs. But I have two use cases which I am not clear how to solve them by ZookeeperCurator.p  ol lipResource hierarchy in locking  We have notion of hierarchy in resources, such that if a resource eg DB table is locked, other requests for that object and all subordinate resourceseg rows should be blocked. Similarly, if subordinates of a resource is locked then the lock request for the resource should block on that. Is there a way to configure curator to serve the above need pli lipActor based reentrancy User U1 logged into the system from node N1. During the system operations he acquires  locks on the shared resources. If he requests the same resource again, it will be granted by curator because the reentrancy check is based on UUID of the thread. If the same user U1 login to the system again from node N2, his requests will be queued because UUIDs wont match. My requirement is that if any user logins simultaneously from different nodesmultiple jvms, all his requests has to be dealt as if he logged in from a single node. Can this be done by replacing UUID with UserID in general any actorapplication based ID in curator If not please help by noting the correct method.pli ol  pPlease let me know any mechanism or framework that has Distributed locking framework and that can meet above requirements.p  pthanks, Nareshp

Negative 2631 pI have a Windows UI, written in C, that calls a DLL, written in C.p  pData is exchanged between the C UI and C DLL using the marshaling techniques available through pInvoke.  Both the UI and the the DLL are legacy code.p  pAll of the software runs on the cloud specifically, on Amazon Web Services AWS.

Newcode needs to service a variety of data requests a single number, a char string, an array of numbers, array of strings, etc.  NewCode will be portable C, so it can run under Linux, Unix, etc.p  pMy questionp  pWhat are my options for having the existing C DLL communicate with NewCode  I know it is too broad a topic to ask for a list of options and their relative merits, so all Im asking for here is to what should be on the list so I can begin my research.  I am a complete newbie in this area, but so far I have determined that on the list should be sockets and pipes.  What else should be on the listp

Negative 2631 pIm using swing to create a kinda larger GUI that will pop up different frames that will act as editors based on the main frames buttons that have been pressed. This project was working yesterday and today I added code to classes that do not touch any of the existing code. Upon finishing some code i decided to run the program again to double check how I formatted the first editing window, but unbeknownst to me something has changed the way how the code executes and now upon hitting the Sprite editor button, the panel that pops up is blank. This panel only is visually blank however, as it has the 19 components that it originally had, as I can see my mouse changing to the text pointer in Text boxes and debug statements show that it has 19 components when I call getComponents.length. My code structure at the moment is a little large but the flow of code is something like this.p  pClass Main Panel renders fine and upon a button press it calls thisp  precodeife.getSource  resourceButton                 Utils.windowFromPanelnew SpriteEditor, SpriteEditor  codepre  pWhich is a function that looks like this.p  precodepublic static JFrame windowFromPanelJPanel panel, String title      JFrame newWindow  new JFrametitle      newWindow.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.DISPOSEONCLOSE     newWindow.getContentPane.add panel      newWindow.pack     newWindow.setVisibletrue       returning it so we can control when it closes in other parts of the program     return newWindow  codepre  pThe return is so that other classes that use this function can call dispose on the frame, but in this case i want to allow as many editors to be open as a user wants. p  pThe constructor for SpriteEditor calls its parents constructor that looks like this.p  precodepublic EditorObject      objectAsStrings  null     displayPanel  null     makeEditorPanel  codepre  pWhere makeEditorPanel is an abstract function that creates the panel, because EditorObject extends JPanel.

I looked up how the android apps such as phone appone where you have contacts displayed in gridvew are designed to deal with this, I see that there is empty space left in the bottom which gives space between recyclerview and floating action button, user just needs to scroll to the bottom to avoid the overlap.

I have fixed the weight paint so that there arent any vertices with more than 4 weights and i can export using the Ogre3D Exporter perfectly fine.  I have uploaded a video a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B2y1O9LVhOGyVEdJM1V2S0dmUFUviewuspsharing relnofollowherea if someone could please figure out this problem for me i would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2631 pI wrote this Python code to do a particular computation in a bigger project and it works fine for smaller values of codeNcode but it doesnt scale up very well for large values and even though I ran it for a number of hours to collect the data, I was wondering if there was a way to speed this upp  precodeimport numpy as np  def FillArrayarr while0 in arr     ind1  np.random.randint0,N     ifarr[ind1]0         ifind10             arr[ind1]  1             arr[ind11]  2         elifind1lenarr1             arr[ind1]  1             arr[ind11]  2         else             arr[ind1]  1             arr[ind11]  2             arr[ind11]  2     else         continue return arr  N50000  dist  [] for i in range1000     arr  [0 for x in rangeN]     dist.appendFillarrarr.count2 codepre  pFor codeN  50,000code, it currently takes slightly over a minute on my computer for one iteration to fill the array. So if I want to simulate this, lets say, a 1000 times, it takes many hours. Is there something I can do to speed this up p  pEdit 1 I forgot to mention what it actually does. I have a list of length codeNcode and I initialize it by having zeros in each entry. Then I pick a random number between code0code and codeNcode and if that index of the list has a zero, I replace it by code1code and its neighboring indices by code2code to indicate they are not filled by code1code but they cant be filled again. I keep doing this till I populate the whole list by code1code and code2code and then I count how many of the entries contain code2code which is the result of this computation. Thus I want to find out if I fill an array randomly with this constraint, how many entries will not be filled.p  pObviously I do not claim that this is the most efficient way find this number so I am hoping that perhaps there is a better alternative way if this code cant be speeded up.p

Negative 2631 pI have an array of x,y positions at one time step and but I know over time this range will expand as set by the image range already. Is there a way to make the rest of the grid over the range be 0 until it is populated. My understanding is that the x,y positions or the map itself from np.histogram2d will need to be restructured on a new grid of a different size, though Im not sure how. So far I havep  precodeheatmap, xedges, yedges  np.histogram2dx,y, bins50 extent  [xedges[0], xedges[1], yedges[0], yedges[1]] ax.imshowheatmap.T, originlower,extentextent,cmapcubehelix ax.setxlim[20,220] ax.setylim[1,1] codepre  pBut this results in a confined region. I want to make the white space black basically, until the new x,y positions populate them at some later time step.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvF1rz.png altheatmapp
Negative 2631 pI am trying to create an custom app that allows me to search by Iterationxtype rallyiterationcombobox, then use a checkboxxtype checkbox to show only the Blocked items, and display this all on a grid.p  pI am having trouble with the checkbox.

Negative 2631 pIm currently building my own dynamic array type, which also implements the codereserveCapacitycode method. Since my array type dynamically resizes its capacity I was wondering how the behaviour would be in Swifts codeArraycode type.br Was it just going to keep the capacity until the size of the array is changed the next time  no. When calling the codereserveCapacitycode function it keeps the capacity or more of the array that way strongforeverstrong unless you call coderemoveAllcode.br I found this to be very weird, since it seems very space inefficient to have alot of allocated space with nothing occupying it. But then I thought, that this might just be the way codereserveCapacitycode is supposed to work.br But then I wanted to know if Swifts codeArraycodes ever reduce their size  they dont.p  pHow does a hrefhttpswiftstub.com363094414 relnofollowthisa make sensep  pAlso I noticed, that the capacity grows exponentially at the beginning code2 gt 4 gt 8 gt ...code, but when it reaches code64code it goes weird code64 gt 188 gt 388 gt ...code, as seen a hrefhttpswiftstub.com563855460 relnofollowherea.

Afterwards I tryed connecting via Putty and Git Bash both failed.  Putty just gave a cryptik connection timed out Git Bash returned p  pcodessh conncet to host xxx.xx.xx.xx port 22 bad file number fatal Could not read from remote repository.codep  pGoogeling did not return anything really usefull since the port can not be blocked by the server. I can not change to a https conection and need to use ssh. Turning off the windows firewall did also not help.  p  pI hope someone can help me with this, kind regards, mhwhp

Negative 2631 pI am developing the iPhone version of an Android game using SpriteKit and objectivec. The Android version was developed using libGDX. There the movement across the screen was done by updating the coordinate values whenever the predefined render method is called. While reading the docs in SpriteKit, I found that here the nodes are moved across the screen by using SKAction where the end coordinates and the duration is given and the action is applied to the node. Is this the only way the node can be moved Or can I update the coordinatesin the update method according to the time interval even after the adding the node to the parent nodewithout calling the SKAction anywhere  p

Negative 2631 pSo I have a dilemma, I have to create a nutch crawler to check the status of links on a website. p  pMy thoughts were by using Nutch 1.9 I could crawl site using the codebincrawl urls testoutput 5code command. I used 5 as my limiter because Im still not sure of how many iterations Ill need. After I get my data, I use the codebinnutch readdb testoutputcrawldb dump outputResultscode command to give me a text output of my results from the crawler. I would then parse the text file and input the results into a db. p  pThen Nutch 2.3 came out and allowed you to directly tie into a dbIm using Mongodb v2.6.9. Im not sure how to use the same codebincrawlcode command seeing that I dont know where to direct the command for the output directory. Instead, Ive just broken down the steps for the crawl and did the following instead. p  ol lip binnutch inject urlspli lip binnutch generate topN 80 80 for now, not sure what else I could usepli lip binnutch fetch allpli lip binnutch parse allpli lip binnutch updatedb allpli ol  pKeep in mind that currently I only have 1 url in my seedlist and on that page there are over 30 links. However, before when I ran this command I got 32 results and now Im only getting 1. In the 1.9 version I am getting a lot more, I think it has something to do with the limiter. Also, it seems like the first time, there were a lot of urls that had a status of 1, or unfetched, whats the reasoning behind thisp  pSo my questions are p  ul liHow can I set a number of rounds or limiter for 2.3li liHow can I use the codebincrawlcode command for 2.3 with Mongodbli liWhy are most of the Urls status saying unfetched even after running the fetch commandli liIs there any other pointers to help with Nutch 2.3 and Mongodb I had to use a patch to get around hadoop file permissions since Im not actually using hadoopli ul  pThanksp

To delete an element later i use the mentioned deletetableviewcellwithleftswipefeature. Everything works fine. p  pstrongProblemstrong  One special constellation causes an app crash. When i swipe to the left the red deletebutton becomes visible. In that moment the background thread fires the pop up window. I click yes to add the element to the table view.

When starting the deleteprocedure 1 element is in the list. After clicking the deletebutton there should be no more 0 element in the list. Due to the upcoming new element during the deleteprocedure there is instead one element left when the deleteprocedure ends. I think that causes the app crash. p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pIn fact the solution of the problem is not that difficult. The easiest way would be to block new upcoming elements while the deleteprocedure is in progress. p  pAnd that is my question How can i do this Is there an easy way to recognize when a table view cell is swiped to the left and the deleteprocedure is started To recognize the deletebuttonclick is easy of course, but not what i need. I found an other solution which is to implement an own SwipableTableViewCellClass which can handle the swipe. But a much easier solution would be nice. p  pSomething like p  ul liOverride a the method which is called when the cell is swiped to the left li liStop the background thread from firing pop up windowsli liCall the normal routine to make the red delete button visibleli ul  pHas anybody an idea how i can solve my problem  Thx in advancep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMethod to handle deletebuttonclick looks like thisp  precode Override to support editing the table view.  voidtableViewUITableView tableView commitEditingStyleUITableViewCellEditingStyleeditingStyle forRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if editingStyle  UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete           [tableView beginUpdates]         [tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectsindexPath, nil] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]         [tableView endUpdates]        codepre

Negative 2631 pI have a searchbar widget on top of a mapview, and what I would like is when I click that widget, a the mapview is replaced by a listview which dynamically changes the displayed items as I enter my query and keep the searchbar widget on top.

Negative 2631 pThe old UISearchDisplayController class is now deprecated and instead we have to use the new UISearchController. There used to be a property in the old class called SearchResultsTableView but its gone from the new class.p  pI populate a table with data and all works as intended  including segueing each rows details to another scene. I throw a search bar in there programmatically  using the new searchController and it successfully reloads the original table with any found results. HOWEVER, when touching a selected row after a search, the segue passed along is that of the original table row that happens to be in the same position of the one touched now i.e. if I choose the current second row of a search, the next scene will segue the details of the second row of the original table Thats because despite the data in the rows are being successfuly repopulated with the search data, the index numbers are still those of the old data.p  pIt used to be with the old type that we would check this as suchp  precodeif self.resultSearchController.active  let indexPath  self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView.indexPathForSelectedRow  else  let indexPath  self.tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow codepre  pSo I think that with the old UISearchDisplayController class you actually got a new table, whereas with the new SearchController Class you only get new rows inside the old table This totaly doesnt make sense p  pHere is my full code per requestp  precodeimport UIKit import Foundation class secondTableViewController UITableViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, UISearchResultsUpdating   var filteredTableData  [String] var resultSearchController  UISearchController     these 2 are standard for the title and subtitle var TableTitleArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt var TableSubArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt  the following are for my seque to next scene var thefnameArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt var thebasicsArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt var thepmethodArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt var theseatsArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt var thenotesArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt var thetableDataArraylt String gt  Array lt String gt      override func viewDidLoad        tableView.delegate  self     tableView.dataSource  self       self.title  currentBus       super.viewDidLoad      self.resultSearchController           let controller  UISearchControllersearchResultsController nil            controller.searchResultsUpdater  self         controller.dimsBackgroundDuringPresentation  false         controller.searchBar.sizeToFit          self.tableView.tableHeaderView  controller.searchBar          return controller            Reload the table     self.tableView.reloadData         var url  httpthepathtomyjsonfile      getdatafromurlurl      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning      super.didReceiveMemoryWarning      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.

Negative 2631 pIve inherited a nodejs application with reasonable complexity. It interacts with 5 other applications through various network interfaces, mostly HTTP REST APIs.

Negative 2631 pFrom Unity documentation p  blockquote   pUnity interception enables you to effectively capture calls to objects and add additional functionality to the target object.

Negative 2631 phaving a slightly weird issue that I cant figure out. Ive set up a javascript timer, all it does is repeats an interval every second that checks the difference between 2 dates and displays the results. All seems fine, however when leaving the browser open for several minutes not touching it.. literally walking away for a while, it seems to time out and stop functioning. No console error messages or anything, the code just stops executing..

I changed the above shortcode to thisp  precodeif issetPOST[wmnfadddonation]      global woocommerce     customprice  POST[donationamount] gt 0  POST[donationamount]  0     targetproductid  65986     SESSION[donationamount]  customprice     woocommercegtcartgtaddtocarttargetproductid, 1     wpredirect siteurl . giftsswagbag  codepre  pThen I added the following filters to functions.phpp  precodeaddfilterwoocommercegetprice,donationprice, 10, 2 addfilterwoocommercegetregularprice,donationprice, 10, 2 addfilterwoocommercegetsaleprice,donationprice, 10, 2 function donationpriceprice, productd      ifproductdgtid  65986         price  SESSION[donationamount]            return price  codepre  pThis does not work except when wpredirect is commented out, hence, not redirecting. The above redirects to the cart, but its empty. If I comment out the wpredirect line and then manually go to the cart, the product is there with my custom price. Actually, I would like to apply a custom price and redirect directly to the checkout page instead of the cart, if possiblep
Negative 2631 pIm looking for a coding pattern that comfortably solves the following problem This is a paradigm I find myself having to use a lot in my development. After the user opens any UI likely the following is happeningp  ol liLoad data from local storageli liUpdate UI with local datali liLoad data from remoteli liStore remote data to local storageli liUpdate UI with remote datali ol  pA simple example would be loading a Twitter timeline for example. The app will present to the user what it has, updates from remote in the background and then updates the UI if it found more recent tweets.p  pIdeally, each step would run async and be cancelable at any time.

Negative 2631 pI have developed a Web Application a standard web application to allow users to display and update a set of data from an SQL database. p  pThe Web Application uses a AngularJS client side which interacts with the Web Server via MVC Web API calls to retrieve and update data on the database. The Server side code is written in C using .NET 4.5 and uses Entity Framework v6.0 to access the database.p  pThe Web Application is hosted in an Azure Web App. The Database is the Azure SQL Database.p  pThe issue is that when the Application has not been used for about 1015 minutes, then it is used again, the first data retrieval often takes over 10 seconds to  return to the browser. After that the performance is fine until the next time the application is left unused.p  pIve put trace in the application and we see that the delay is when the connection opens. The actual query on the database runs subsecond.p  pIve noticed though that with different hosting configurations I get different results. In particular hosting in house and pointing to the Azure database does not encounter anywhere near the same delays.p  pIve changed one of the routines to use ADO.NET instead of Entity Framework and changed the trace to try to narrow it down further.p  pWhat I see is thisp  precodeConnectionStringSettings ADOcnxstring  ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[DevFEConnectAdo] DbConnection ADOconnection  new SqlConnectionADOcnxstring.ConnectionString codepre  pThe delay is here before the SQL has even been definedp  pand then I build the command and do the DataReader etcp  precode    DbCommand ADOcommand  ADOconnection.CreateCommand               etc codepre  pSo the delay is on opening the Connection to the database.p  pMy connection string is standardp  precodeltadd nameDevFEConnectAdo connectionStringdata    sourcefeeunsqldevfeconnect.database.windows.netinitial  catalogfeeunsqldbdevfeconnectpersist security infoTrueuser id passwordmultipleactiveresultsetsTruegtltaddgt codepre  pAny ideas appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2631 pI am using delayedpaperclip with delayedjob to run a background job for image processing. I am trying to upload 3 different images, each with 4 styles.

This means that it is showing the first image as a duplicate, and Im losing the real second image. Basically its showing 8 styles of the logo when I want 4 styles of the logo and 4 of the image.
