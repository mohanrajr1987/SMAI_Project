Positive 34305 pI have a query that was on the top of my activity monitor as the most expensive query at average duration  18,000ms. My table is currently at 2,533,081 rows. My index is on an alternative bigint column, which i have generated so i can have a clustered unique index. The GUID is a uniqueidentifier datatype of which i have no control over comes from an interface and the design decision was made a decade ago. p  pUnfortunately, the update query needed to check the GUID unique identifier. This is the one that is causing performance issues now after 2 months of execution. The only parameter i receive for the reset is the GUID, so i cannot use date, time or any other parameter for resetting the log record. p  precodeupdate Log set reset  sockettime  where guid  guid and reset is null  codepre  pI created yesterday a second nonclustered index on the uniqueidentifier GUID only, and it returned the performance back to good levels again. p  pWhat i want to ask in this forum is what speaks against creating such a second index on uniqueidentifier What should i do to maintain performance on the uniqueidentifier index p  pThanks in advance. p

Positive 34305 pWe have a large DB and the cust is complaining that performance is very slow when running searches through the applications interface. It is all supplied by a 3rd party vendor and Ive calculated from their guides that the DB will require IoPs of 1300. They dont provide a great deal of info on what that actually means and having just run diskspd I can see it meets the min requirements from the vendor. p  pHaving no context with results to compare against Im not sure if the latency is good or bad. Can anyone give advice on whether the results below would be ok for youp  pThe DB is mainly used for searching although it is writing around 450,000 new records per day and currently has around 270 million rows of data.p  pThe DB drives are all NAS based, located on a Netapp NAS connected via 1GB iSCSI over a standard NIC no HBA was installed by the custp  pI know this probably isnt very helpful

Negative 34305 pWe have bunch of autogenerated classes which are mostly Axis2 stubs, skeletons etc. For some complicated wsdls, Axis2 generates a TON of javabeans, stubs etc. And I am sure there are other cases too when auto generation is used.p  pFor now we treat these as other first class members of our codebase and they are stored in the same packages.p  pHowever when doing refactoring, cleanups etc it becomes hard to weed out the warnings that are coming from these autogenerated classes. For example, if I am trying to clean up the code so as to use Java1.5 generics, there is no good way to know how many of these offending classes are ours vs being autogenerated.p  pShould I be separating these autogenerated parts out into a different package How do you guys store such artifacts in the repositoryp  pEDIT I see generate during build process in quite a few answers below. While I see the benefits of doing that, I dont quite see how I can get away from a repository checkin. p  pMy code has compile time dependencies on some of these classes and for me, a build during development is a ctrls in eclipse. We use antscripts to generate the compile, run tests and generate deliverables.p

Negative 34305 pstrongThe short versionstrongp  ol li Why are the subviews of NSView objects not sent a codereleasecode message when a Cocoa application terminates li Is there a way to override this behaviour ol  pstrongAn examplestrongbr  The codeMyViewcode class shown below is nothing more than an codeNSViewcode subclass that reports to the console when it is created and destroyed. I have tested it out and found it to work properly. However, when I use it as shown in the next code snippet from my application delegate, I see something unexpected see sample output.p  precode MyView  interface MyView  NSView   end  implementation MyView   idinitWithFrameNSRectframeRect      if self  [super initWithFrameframeRect]  nil  return nil      NSLoginit , self     return self    voiddealloc      NSLogdealloc , self     [super dealloc]   end codepre  pcode codep  precode Application delegate   voidapplicationDidFinishLaunchingNSNotification aNotification      NSLogbegin      parentView  [[MyView alloc] initWithFrameNSMakeRect0, 0, 100, 100]      MyView  myView  [[MyView alloc] initWithFrameNSMakeRect10, 10, 80, 80]     [parentView addSubviewmyView]     [myView release]      NSLogrun    voidapplicationWillTerminateNSNotification aNotification      NSLogquit     [parentView release]     NSLogend.  codepre  pThis application produces the following outputp  blockquote   pbeginbr    init codeltcodeMyView 0x10013f840codegtcodebr    init codeltcodeMyView 0x10261b620codegtcodebr    runbr    quitbr    dealloc codeltcodeMyView 0x10013f840codegtcodebr    end.p blockquote  pstrongThe problemstrongbr  I can clearly see that the first view object is being released when the application quits, and Im certain tested and verified that codeNSViewcode objects automatically release their subviews when they themselves are released. However, it appears that during application termination those subviews are not being released.p  pstrongThe long version AKA why on earth would anyone care strongbr  Let me start by saying that I am familiar with the way memory is freed by a running application when it quits. I know that my subviews will be properly disposed of, even if they are never sent a codereleasecode message, so Im not worried about this being a leak. In fact, Im pretty sure but not 100 certain that the answer to my question 1 is Because releasing subviews is unnecessary when the application is about to terminate.p  pI use some simple handrolled code to do memory tracking while my application is running in debug mode. I make a calls to a codeTraceInitcode and codeTraceDealloccode method in the codeinitcode and codedealloccode methods of all of my custom classes, and I use the codeatexitcode function to report any unreleased objects after the Cocoa portion of my application has finished. I find this to be much simpler than running Apples memory leak performance tool on a regular basis. If I cause a memory leak while running, Ill know about it as soon as my application quits.p  pHowever, the lack of a codedealloccode call during termination means that any of my custom codeNSViewcode subclasses that are used as subviews show up as memory leaks when I quit the application. Thus the reason for my question 2. I would like to have Cocoa release everything during termination so that my memory tracking is able to wrap up properly. Naturally, I would only override the default behaviour in debug mode. My released app has none of the memory tracking code enabled, and should be able to quit itself as efficiently as normal.p  pstrongThats itstrong phew If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read it all.p

Negative 34305 pi am creating a simple windows cmd program, and i am trying to make sure it only runs once if u double click the exe file, only one instance will show..  so in my code.. i added a named mutexthe name is a GUID .. if a 2nd instance of the program was started, it would show the message telling you, that you already got an instance running..p  pwhat i want to do is to upgrade the code. so instead of showing you a message, it would automatically, find the already running process window , switch focus to it, and then close itself.p  pnow i am trying to usep  precode FindWindowNULL,windowname  SetForegroundWindowwindow codepre  phowever, when i pass the window name from the task manager it doesnt find it  Error says  Unused S which is weird, i even tried to use the task manager name instead ..and it still couldnt find itp  pso can some1 point out to me,where did i go wrong   also, if you can think of any other ways of doing such a task , please tell me..p  pnote some friend at work told me to use enumwindows, is it a good choice i am currently reading about it ... thx alotp

Negative 34305 pI have been given a bit of a strange task, there are around 15002000 jpeg images all of around 150kb in size. They are currently stored in a simple database I made with Postgres. Its been a long time since I used Matlab and Postgres heavily so any help or suggestions is really appreciatedp  pI need to get the images that are stored in the database, out of the database into Java. The last step is retrieve the image from Java into Matlab so that the image is stored in the same way in which the imread function works in Matlab. The imread function reads an image in and creates a n by m by 3 matrix array of uint8 values which denote the pixel intensities of RGB.p  pAtm I have got the image in and out of the database in Java, currently storing the image in a bytea column data type. Is the best data type to usep  pHow can I get the data back out from the database, so that it is either the constructed jpeg image which I put in or is in the requested matrix array format p  pCurrently I do not understand the retrieved data. It is in a byte array of around 70,000 elements containing values between 128 to 128. Helpp  pNote The database toolkit is unavailable to mep  pANOTHER UPDATE I have solved the problem related to the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1266707postgresencodingutf8errorwhilstinsertingimagesviajavaposta regardingUTF8 encoding error. p  pIf anyone stumbles upon this page, any answer posted will be tried as soon as I can I really do appreciate your thoughts and answers.

Negative 34305 pI am starting to write an application in Silverlight with RIA services and SilverlightFx.

And as it is a big one using frameworks will help unit testing and save development time once the frameworks are understood properly.pli lipAfter reading through the blogs I am not really clear how SilverlightFx handles interaction between user controls. For example I have a user control say S that have the search functionality...auto complete and all...Now I have another UserControl Say R that displays the search results. The display result panel can be used from search user control or another user control Say F that gives all items of a particular category. I can not marge Search and Select Category into a single userontrol. So how to do it If I create different ViewModels how they will interect with each otherpli lipIs it better to create Domain service context in each ViewModel or to use a single one across the applicationpli ol
Negative 34305 pAll,p  pWanted to get a few thoughts on this.  Lately I am becoming more and more of a subscriber of purist DIIOC principles when designingdeveloping. Part of this a big part involves making sure there is little coupling between my classes, and that their dependencies are resolved via the constructor there are certainly other ways of managing this, but you get the idea.p  pMy basic premise is that extension methods violate the principles of DIIOC.p  pI created the following extension method that I use to ensure that the strings inserted into database tables are truncated to the right sizep  precodepublic static class StringExtensions      public static string TruncateToSizethis string input, int maxLength              int lengthToUse  maxLength         if input.Length lt maxLength                      lengthToUse  input.Length                   return input.Substring0, lengthToUse       codepre  pI can then call my string from within another class like sop  precodestring myString  myValue.TruncateThisPartPlease. myString.TruncateToSize8 codepre  pA fair translation of this without using an extension method would bep  precodestring myString  myValue.TruncateThisPartPlease. StaticStringUtil.TruncateToSizemyString, 8 codepre  pAny class that uses either of the above examples could not be tested independently of the class that contains the TruncateToSize method TypeMock aside. If I were not using an extension method, and I did not want to create a static dependency, it would look more likep  precodestring myString  myValue.TruncateThisPartPlease. stringUtil.TruncateToSizemyString, 8 codepre  pIn the last example, the stringUtil dependency would be resolved via the constructor and the class could be tested with no dependency on the actual TruncateToSize methods class it could be easily mocked.p  pFrom my perspective, the first two examples rely on static dependencies one explicit, one hidden, while the second inverts the dependency and provides reduced coupling and better testability.p  pSo does the use of extension methods conflict with DIIOC principles  If youre a subscriber of IOC methodology, do you avoid using extension methodsp

But I found out, that once I set up a request, the periodicallycallremote does not update the specified div.p  pMy question to this 1. is this a good way to implement this behaviour 2. if it is, how do get the periodicallycallremote to work during a submitp

Im using Linq2Sql for the data access and Ive been following the a hrefhttpaspnetmvcbook.s3.amazonaws.comaspnetmvcnerdinnerv1.pdf relnofollowNerdDinner tutoriala. If you look at page 40, you can see they are using partial classes to business rules to their Linq generated classes. To me, that feels wrong is it and Id like to have my own POCOs that are exposed to the presentation tier of my application. It looks like one option a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions51176seperatingconcernswithlinqtosqlanddtosherea, is to use a seperate DTO class. That feels better to me but it adds a lot more code to test and maintain.p  pI like the simplicity of simply adding partial classes to enforce business rules on the Linq classes, but I dont like exposing the Linq classes to my presentation tier, since if the database changes Ill need to update the presentation tier as well.p  pThe DTO approach feels cleaner, since Id never need to update the presentation tier if the database changes, but it is a lot more code to deal with. p  pMy current approach is thus, two Class Libraries one with Linq2Sql DBML  Partial Classes, and the second with a set of classes that have nothing but autogenerated properties and then a repo class that manages getting data from the Linq assembly and converting it to codeIQueryableltTgt.code p  pIs there a better way Is there a better middle ground Can I take the best of both worlds If so, how would you seperate them into different assembliesp  pstrongupdatestrongp  pMaybe, what I really need to do is consolidate all of the PersitenceDomain logic into a single assembly the same approach used in the NerdDinner sample, and then create different View Objects in my presentation tier, that are denormalized versions of my Linq2Sql Entitiesp

Negative 34305 pI am just starting out with the Entity Framework 4.0 and ASP.NET MVC 2 and have a few questions regarding the use of stored procedures and paging.p  pYou can map the Insert, Update, and Delete actions to stored procedures and I have already done this. However for my paging to work I need to map the Select action. p  pNow is the only  best way I can do this by going to my model browser, right clicking on the stored procedure and Add Function Import and adding it.p  pThis results in the following code....p  precodevar contactFormSubmissions  entities.ContactFormSubmissionGetContactFormSubmissions1, 10 codepre  pMy issue with this is that it adds it to the global entity container at root level rather than the ContactFormSubmission entity like the Insert  Update and Delete actions.p  pI would rather something like this but through through a stored procedure...p  precodeentities.ContactFormSubmissions.SelectltContactFormSubmissiongtstring.Empty, pageParam, pageSizeParam codepre  pThis way the select is called in the same way as the other actions and I dont end up with lots of functions in the root of the Entity Container which could get unmanagable.p  pThis is a lesser issue as at least its all working currently. p  pMy next question is how to best implement paging using this function.p  pAll of the examples I have seen on how to accomplish paging using MVC and the Entity Framework have used LINQ and IQueryable. Is there a way of using IQueryable with lazy loading and the LINQ functions Skip  Take with a table based function sproc p  pa hrefhttpblog.wekeroad.com20071210aspnetmvcpagedlistt relnofollowhttpblog.wekeroad.com20071210aspnetmvcpagedlisttap  pPS  any examples of paging in MVC with the Entity Framework using SPs would be greatp

Negative 34305 pIts rather hard to find any documentation on Mocha, so Im afraid Im totally at sea here. I have found a problem with stubbing methods that pass arguments.

Negative 34305 pAs a maintenance issue I need to routinely 35 times per year copy a repository that is now has over 20 million files and exceeds 1.5 terabytes in total disk space.  I am currently using RICHCOPY, but have tried others.  RICHCOPY seems the fastest but I do not believe I am getting close to the limits of the capabilities of my XP machine.p  pI am toying around with using what I have read in The Art of Assembly Language to write a program to copy my files.  My other thought is to start learning how to multithread in Python to do the copies.  p  pI am toying around with the idea of doing this in Assembly because it seems interesting, but while my time is not incredibly precious it is precious enough that I am trying to get a sense of whether or not I will see significant enough gains in copy speed.  I am assuming that I would but I only started really learning to program 18 months and it is still more or less a hobby.  Thus I may be missing some fundamental concept of what happens with interpreted languages.p  pAny observations or  experiences would be appreciated.  Note, I am not looking for any code.  I have already written a basic copy program in Python 2.6 that is no slower than RICHCOPY.  I am looking for some observations on which will give me more speed.  Right now it takes me over 50 hours to make a copy from a disk to a Drobo and then back from the Drobo to a disk.  I have a LogicCube for when I am simply duplicating a disk but sometimes I need to go from a disk to Drobo or the reverse.  I am thinking that given that I can sector copy a 34 full 2 terabyte drive using the LogicCube in under seven hours  I should be able to get close to that using Assembly, but I dont know enough to know if this is valid.  Yes, sometimes ignorance is blissp  pThe reason I need to speed it up is I have had two or three cycles where something has happened during copy fifty hours is a long time to expect the world to hold still that has caused me to have to trash the copy and start over.  For example, last week the water main broke under our building and shorted out the power.  p  pThanks for the early responses but I dont think it is IO limitations.  I am not going over a network, the drive is plugged into my mother board with a sata connection and my Drobo is plugged into a Firewire port, my thinking is that both connections should allow faster transfer.p  pActually I cant use a sector copy except going from a single disk to the Drobo.  It wont work the other way since the Drobo file structure is a mystery.  My unscientific observation is that the copy from one internal disk to another is no faster than a copy to or from the Drobo to an internal disk.p  pI am bound by the hardware, I cant afford 10K rpm 2 terabyte drives if they even make them.p  pA number of you are suggesting a file synching solution.  But that does not solve my problem.  First off, the file synching solutions I have played with build a map for want of a better term of the data first, I have too many little files so they choke.  One of the reasons I use RICHCOPY is that it starts copying immediately, it does not use memory to build a map.  Second, I had one of my three Drobo backups fail a couple of weeks ago.  My rule is if I have a backup failure the other two have to stay off line until the new one is built. So I need to copy from one of the three back up single drive copies I have that I use with the LogicCube.  p  pAt the end of the day I have to have a good copy on a single drive because that is what I deliver to my clients.  Because my clients have diverse systems I deliver to them on SATA drives.  p  pI rent some cloud space from someone where my data is also stored as the deepest backup but it is expensive to pull if off of there.p

Negative 34305 pin my PHP web application,I have a dataentry form where users will enter data using a rich text editor FCKEditor i m using and will be saving the Markup from the editor to the DB table.In another page i have to display the first 200 chars of the content with View more link to view the entire thing.

Negative 34305 pThis is a fairly simple question, but its one I cant find a firm answer on.p  pI have a parent table in PostgreSQL, and then several child tables which have been defined.  A trigger has been established, and the children tables only have data inserted if a field, say field emxem, meets a certain criteria.  p  pWhen I query the parent table with a field based upon emxem, PostgreSQL knows to immediately go to the child table that is related to that particular value of emxem.  p  pThat all being said, I dont need to specify a particular index on the column emxem do I  PostgreSQL already knows how to sort on it, and by adding an index to the parent emxem, PostgreSQL is therefore generating unique indexes on emxem for each of the new child tables.  p  pCreating that index is a bit redundant, right  p

Negative 34305 pIm not sure what is going on with a RichTextBox in a Visual Studio C windows application. This is not a web app.p  pI have a procedure that processes several files. As it processes, it posts progress reports in the RichTextBox using AppendText. The additions have newline chars which keep things neat. This procedure was migrated from one app to another. The form in the new app was created from scratch with a new RichTextBox, and the code was copied.p  pOn the original app, when the messages reach the bottom of the box, they begin to scroll so the new line of text is always visible. On the new app, it does not scroll though I want it to so the new messages including the last one that indicates the process is done are out of sight below the bottom. Ive compared the two programs, and I dont see the difference. I dont see how this behavior would be controlled. It is possible that there is a difference in the procedure that affects focus, or refresh behavior, or whatever.p  pWhere should I lookp

Negative 34305 pI have a project to work on. The project requires SQL server. I am using LINQ. So since I dont have SQL server installed on my computer, is it possible I can just use the LINQ designer to create my classes And then when I do publish my website to a online hosting company, I can use the LINQ to create the tables and stuff p  pIs this overly complicated I want to stay away from using SQLite, or SQL Server Express or SQL server compact because its hard to transfer stuff. Atleast for me. My one problem is also that I want to use ASP.NET Membership stuff. If I run the .exe tool to automatically create my tables, how would I accomplish this without using a db I tried using SQL server compact mdf file i think but apparently the tool does not support it. p  pSo what are my options here.

Negative 34305 pSo as everyone knows, .NETs codeSqlClientcode class offers as a way of getting data from the database the codeExecuteScalarcode method, which returns an codeobjectcode.  While its not a big deal to just cast appropriately, I wanted to write a strongly typed version that returns a properly typed object.  So, I wrote the following Cp  precodepublic T ExecuteScalarltTgtIDbCommand cmd where T  struct      cmd.Connection  this.conn     object o  cmd.ExecuteScalar     return To  codepre  pThis works very well for booleans and codeDateTimecodes.  However, for integers, it throws an codeInvalidCastExceptioncode.  So, I did what anyone armed with a copy of Reflector would do and dove into the codeFieldltTgtthis DataRow, string columnNamecode extension method.  I ripped out the internal class that it uses to convert values to the requested type and tested.  However, for value types, the code is just codereturn Tvaluecode  which is of course not helpful.p  pSo, my question anyone have any thoughts about how I can get my method to properly return values for all value types and strings  Even just string, boolean, codeDateTimecode and int would be fine.p  pThanks in advancep

This should probably work with a Categoriy or Tag system.pli lipstrongsubblogsstrong I would like to have subblogs with their own url, which would present a subset of the blog entries. For instance my blog could deal with politics, sports, and myLife, and I could produce the following blog urls blog.mydomain.tld shows everything, opinions.mydomain.tld shows only the politics related posts, sports.mydomain.tld all entries dedicated to sports. I would also like to theme differently those subblogs i.e. a ball picture for sports.mydomain.tld, etc.pli lipstrongmodular privacystrong my intended audience is heterogeneous family, sets of friends, the internet, and I would like to be able to limit access to certain entries to different subsets of users.

I would then pool them into groups, and define for each entry if it is private, and if so which groups can read it. I do not necessarily want to share the same things between my neighbors and my school friends.pli ul  pThat also brings the issue of RSS syndication either each user would have its how RSS thread, or then RSS could be category specific and the private entries would appear without content.

Negative 34305 pI have an object in my design that has listeners.

I may have just found it, though.  It would be easy enough to create the codeObjectListener[]code every time I add or remove a listener and then just iterate through that with no synchronization every time the event fires.  Im going to make that change now, and then see if theres a better idea offered up here.p

Negative 34305 pIve been developing a web app using JQM to target iOS and Android devices. For much of the start of the development, I have developed and tested using Chrome currently v13 on the desktop. As we get closer to our production release deadline, I have increased testing on physical iOS and Android hardware the difference in performance between the desktop and mobile browsing experience is enormous.p  pThe clientserver interaction is very simple. The client requests a set of views, which the server returns. The client can then request the set of nodes associated with a particular view, which the server will return in a single payload. The client then generates the DOM for each node from the corresponding XML. p  pI have begun testing with XML payloads at or greater than 400kb. On the desktop, in Chrome, this is no issue. On mobile, in Mobile Safari, my DOM load times alone can be close to 12 seconds. Interactions with the DOM which trigger updates to the XML, cached in localStorage can take up to 5 seconds emper clickem.p  pWhile I can think of half a dozen different ways to optimize my clientserver communicationI cant figure out how to measure the expense of my individual method calls from the mobile client. I know that a 400k payload is too much for the iOS Mobile Safari, but I dont know whether the performance cost Im incurring comes from traversing the DOM or manipulating the XML.p  pHow can I perform metric analysis of my mobile web app from the perspective of the mobile client Performance tuning to the desktop isnt getting me anywhere, and I dont have an equivalent developer consoleFireBug on the mobile side.p  pHow do other mobile developers solve this problemp

Negative 34305 pI have a complex project in Microsoft Office Excel 2007 which utilises a large number of UDFs.

Only when its opened strongAFTERstrong another workbook within the same instance, my project will inherit the Automatic calculation setting from the strongFIRSTstrong workbook and perform endless calculation on my UDFs.

This only happens if my project is strongNOTstrong the one opened first.p  pThrough a hrefhttpwww.decisionmodels.comcalcsecretse.htm relnofollowhttpwww.decisionmodels.comcalcsecretse.htma, I discover that it is the nature of Excel to perform the calculation process strongBEFOREstrong the WorkbookOpen event is executed.p  pSo the question I have obviously relates to the project being opened strongAFTERstrong another workbook is opened with automatic calculation turned ONp  ol liHow do I force my project to strongdisablestrong automatic calculation without it performing recalculation first remember, problem only occurs when the project not the first one to be opened since it will follow settings from previously opened workbook strongORstrong...li liHow do I get the project to open in ANOTHER INSTANCE when double clicked to avoid inheriting automatic calculation setting from the previous workbook.li ol  pEither way, the answer Im seeking is for the project to open without performing the calculation first. p  pThanksp

Negative 34305 pI am learning general development strategies but there are a lot question in my mind about them. One of them is about creating application layer which shouldnt have dependencies Presentation layer. For example, in MVC application lets say we have application services but this application services doesnt check validation for incoming data models from Presentation layer. It is only checked in controller via ASP.NET MVC validations also service layer doesnt include any authorization stuffs inside. All job is done in Presentation layer. Do you think that is it correct architecture  Do i have to include all validation and authorizations inside service layer reagain  If you say yes but how  p  pHow can i include authorization in service layer  I really dont know how to control auhthorizations inside service layer.

Negative 34305 pLets say I have a Django project with three apps foo, bar, and glue.  Im trying to follow reusable app conventions, so foo and bar are not dependent on and dont know anything about each other or on glue.  Glue contains code to integrate the other two apps into the site.p  pFoo supplies a template tag that I want to include in one of the pages supplied by bar.  The view for bars page can be passed an alternate template.  I make a template in glue that extends bars template and includes the template tag from foo.  In order to pass my new template to bars view, I need to modify the urlconf entry that points to it.p  pMy project urlconf looks something like thisp  precodeurlpatterns  patterns,   r, includeglue.urls,   rfoo, includefoo.urls,   rbar, includebar.urls,  codepre  pWhats the most elegant way to pass the alternate template or any other arbitrary view arguments, for that matter to the view in bar  I dont want to modify bars urlconf directly, as that would make it dependent on glue. p  pThe only other method I can think of is to remove codeincludebar.urlscode, copy the url patterns in bars urlconf into the project urlconf, and modify the pattern Im interested in.  That approach violates the DRY principle though.  Is there some other solution that Im missingp

Negative 34305 pIve started to write a design for my video streaming site. a hrefhttpwww.xjerk.comnew.site relnofollowhttpwww.xjerk.comnew.sitea [SFW]p  pThe content area is horizontally fluid, and the white boxes in the content area are divs that are floated left. This means they all sit next to each other nicely, and flow onto a new line when theres no room left.p  pHowever, the content area often has a blank area on the right side, where theres not enough room for another white box. I would like to get rid of this either by making the whole container div containerinner shrink to remove this space, or failing that, make the blue bar above the white boxes contract by making content contract so the the right edge is in line with the white boxes.p  pIve tried setting the left area content to inlineblock, but this doesnt work since the content inside is bigger than the div width hence the overflow onto multiple lines.p  pIs there any way this can be achieved, or would a fixed width design be my best betp  pPS I hope Ive explained everything well enough.p

Negative 34305 pIm writing a utility to help with testing a much larger system, and my UI doesnt show up at all if I run it through the system.  It works fine when I run it myself.  More detailsp  ol liThe system Im testing has many processes, managed by a controller.  When deployed, controller.exe spawns and terminates child processes, including my java app.  When launched by the controller, my app runs fine does work, generates logs, etc. but the Swing UI doesnt render at all.li liI can launch my app myself from the command line, and the UI shows up just fine. According to Process Explorer, the Path, Command Line, and Current Directory are all identical to the values observed when the app is launched from the controller.li liWhen the app is invisble, clicking Bring to Front in Process Explorer pops a dialog that says. No visible windows found for this process.  Clicking the same button on the manually spawned process brings the Swing UI to front as expected.li liIm testing this in Windows XP.  The controller process runs under SYSTEM. I used the a hrefhttpverbalprocessor.com20071205runningacmdpromptaslocalsystem relnofollowat 0945 interactive cmd.exe tricka to spawn a command prompt as SYSTEM for my manual launch.  Process Explorer verifies that both methods manual  controller spawn the java process as SYSTEM.li liThe only obvious difference between the two processes are the parents.  The system process spawns as a child of controller.exe, while my manual executions are a child of cmd.exe.li liI have remotely debugged into the invisible process using using jdwp, and everything looks normal.  The UI code executes, no exceptions are thrown, and my JLists are even getting populated with the data they monitor.  As far as I can tell, everything works I just cant see any of it.li ol  pI apologize if this has been answered elsewhere. I did my best to search around, but all the questions I could find are about certain components failing to render, never a failure of the entire app to display.p  pThanksp  pEdits Based on feedback, Ive swapped in a demo program thats as small as possible.

However, when the controller spawns the process, nothing displays.  When spawned by the controller, I can debug into the process remotely using codeagentlibjdwptransportdtsocket,suspendy,servery,address8000code and verify that all of the threads are spawning as expected, and that no exceptions are thrown.p  pMy intuition from here is that controller is in some odd graphics configuration and, since is parents the new java process, maybe Swing is not using the correct GraphicsDevice  I tried adding this codep  precodeGraphicsEnvironment ge  GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment forGraphicsDevice d  ge.getScreenDevices    Log.printlnd   for GraphicsConfiguration c  d.getConfigurations        Log.printlnc     Log.printlnc.getBounds     codepre  pThe log contains thisp  precodeWin32GraphicsDevice[screen0] sun.awt.Win32GraphicsConfig13f459d[devWin32GraphicsDevice[screen0],pixfmt0] java.awt.Rectangle[x0,y0,width1920,height1080] codepre  pwhich seems to indicate theres only one device with one config, so Im at a bit of a loss.p

Negative 34305 pIn some of the audio libraries Ive been looking at, a sample of audio is often represented as a double or a float with a range of 1.0 to 1.0.  In some cases, this easily allows analysis and synthesis code to abstract what the underlying datatype might actually be signed long int, unsigned char, etc.p  pAssuming IEEE 754, we have nonuniform density.  As the number approaches zero, the density increases.  This means that we have less precision for numbers approaching 1 and 1.  p  pThis nonuniform number density doesnt matter if we can represent a sufficient number of values for the underlying datatype that were converting tofrom.p  pFor instance, if the underlying data type was an unsigned char, we only need 256 values between 1 and 1 or 8 bitsusing a double is clearly not a problem.p  pMy question is how many bits of precision do I have  Can I safely convert tofrom an 32 bit integer without loss  To extend the question, what would the range of values have to be to safely convert tofrom a 32 bit integer without lossp  pThanksp

Negative 34305 pI have a problem that I cant seem to fix. I am trying to take a screenshot of a UIScrollView including offscreen content but when the view is long the renderInContext doesnt get all the contents of the scroll view. The produced image dimensions are correct but the rendered data appears to be missing chunks of the display leaving white space where those chunks should be. The missing blocks are from the content in a UIWebView, which I believe is set to scaleToFit. It doesnt happen everytime, it appears to only happen when the UIWebViews height if fairly large. Which makes me think is has to do with the scaling of the UIWebView.p  pIf I adjust the coreLayer.bounds CGRECT below I get different results, sometimes the missing blocks are at the bottom and sometimes they are in the middle of the image. p  pI started with the code from the accepted answer of this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3539717gettingascreenshotofauiscrollviewincludingoffscreenpartsquestiona and when I noticed the cutoff issue, I modified it to the followingp  precodeUIGraphicsBeginImageContextscrollView.contentSize      CGPoint savedContentOffset  scrollView.contentOffset     CGRect savedFrame  scrollView.frame       hide the scroll bars     [scrollView setShowsHorizontalScrollIndicatorNO]     [scrollView setShowsVerticalScrollIndicatorNO]       scrollView.contentOffset  CGPointZero     scrollView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, scrollView.contentSize.width, scrollView.contentSize.height     adjust layer for cutoff     CALayer coreLayer  scrollView.layer     coreLayer.bounds  CGRectMake0, 0, scrollView.contentSize.width, scrollView.contentSize.height     [coreLayer renderInContext UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext]      [scrollView.layer renderInContext UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext]     image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext      scrollView.contentOffset  savedContentOffset     scrollView.frame  savedFrame       reset the scroll bars to default     [scrollView setShowsHorizontalScrollIndicatorYES]     [scrollView setShowsVerticalScrollIndicatorYES]  UIGraphicsEndImageContext codepre  pThe cutoff adjustment helped fixed it with some views but its still getting cutoff when the UIScrollView is fairly long.

Negative 34305 pIm starting a new project very soon, and im considering long polling to notify the users that they have a new private messageNotification that they have to check, really similar to how Facebook uses to notify you that someone has posted something about youLiked a photo of you..p  pFrom what I have read, cometd seemed like a really good option to start with.p  pThen, other ways started emerging, like Socket.io, and node.js ..p  pNow, my question is Which one do you think is the best option for this case and whyp  pWhat I need to do exactly is the followingp  ul liUser 1 logs into their accountli liUser 2 sends User 1 a message which gets stored into the database and a flag is generated, If possible li liThe PHP script responsible for User 1 should pick up the flag, and push a notification to User 1li ul  pI know how to take care of the javascript side, but I have never done anything similar to long polling.

Negative 34305 pIm working on a project already started by several developers before me. One thing in particular bothers me is that they have single entity split in two databases.p  pEntity is called Tracker.p  pFirst database is called ConfigBase, and it has table named Trackers that has TrackerId along with its attributes.p  pSecond database is called StoreBase, and it also has table named Trackers, whose elements have matching TrackerId as it is in the first base. p  pMoreover, to have things even more complicated, when you access specific tracker in ConfigBase, you gain SQL server name and credentials that allow you to access it in StoreBase.p  pNow all this isnt too much complicated if you use plain old ADO.NET. But as my task is to raise entire solution to newest EF 4.3.1, Im having troubles maintaining consistency of my entity. Half of things related to Tracker entity are in ConfigBase and the other half in StoreBase, and usually I have to get both to get some result.p  pIs there any solution to this that does not involve virtual merge on database level. Im looking for a solution that can be done with Code First modelling.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 34305 pI have a list of values in a SQL Table which are used to popluate a DropDownList, having a unique Integer as the value of each item and a String as the visible text via SqlDataSource. There is also a third field in the database which is a flag to indicate whether the list item is active or not inactive items are not shown in the DropDownListp  pSelections made in the dropdown are stored in the database as their integer value as part of a dataset making up the overall record, not the text value.p  pOver time, the items in the DropDownList may be removed by marking the items as inactive. However, there is still a need to open old records which may have had a nowinactive item as part of its data... p  pMy question is, whats the best way to ensure that the missing value included in the dropdown for the old recordp  pThe two methods that spring to mind are to eitherp  pPopulate DropDownList with only the currently active items and, when loading a record, catch when the app tries to select a value that doesnt exist, go back to the db to see what it should be the text value and manually add it into the dropdown.p  por...p  pPopulate DropDownList with all list items both active and inactive, load the record and then programatically remove all the inactive items execpt for any that are now selected.p  pNeither of these seem particularly efficient, so I was wondering whether there is a best practice for this kind of thingp

Negative 34305 pWhat is the difference between an unknown value and an omitted value for an attribute in WEKA  I learned that for a missing value, we put the  mark as the value for the corresponding attribute, and 0 for an omitted value. What is the difference. p  pSuppose we were to plot the data in a n dimensional space, then how will the unknown values be represented along their axes, because they are not zero.p  pThanks Abhishek Sp
Negative 34305 pI have resigned myself to the fact that many of the features that EC2 users are accustomed to in particular, tagging do not exist in OpenStack. There is, however, one piece of functionality whose absence is driving me crazy.p  pAlthough OpenStack doesnt have full support for instance tags like EC2 does, it strongdoesstrong have the notion of an instance name. This name is exposed by the Web UI, which even allows you to set itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwcVoW.png altInstance Name in the instance listp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwwXwX.png altEditing the Instance Namep  pThis name is also exposed through the codenova listcode command line utility.p  pHowever and this is my problem this field is emnotem exposed through the codenovaec2code API layer. The cleanest way for them to integrate this with existing EC2 platform tools would be to simulate an instance Tag with name Name, but they dont do this. Whats more, I cant figure out which Nova API endpoint I can use to read and write the name it doesnt seem to be documented on the a hrefhttpapi.openstack.org relnofollowAPI referencea but of course it must be somehow possible since the web client and codenovaclientcode can both somehow do it.p  pAt the moment, Im forced to change it manually from the website every time I launch a new instance. I cant do it during instance creation because I use the codenovaec2code API, not the codenovacode command line client.p  pMy question isp  ol liIs there a way to readwrite the instance name through the EC2 API layerli liFailing that, what is the REST endpoint to set it programmaticallyli listrongBONUSstrong What is Novas progress on supporting general instance taggingli ol

Note As this question will expect for design patterns during application development for mobile and crossplatform applications, i will tag it with the tag strongdesignpatternsstrong toop

It was grouping by dis field only. I want the modify the query to get this fields formatted as i needyears only. Any advices would be appreciated. Thanks in advancep
Negative 34305 pI always put my script tags at the bottom of the page since its good practice to load scripts after things like HTMLCSS and text has finished loading. I just found out about the defer attribute which basically does the same thing, that is it waits till the page has finished loading before fetching and executing scripts.p  pSo if using the defer attribute is it necessary to physically place script tags at the bottom of the page vs inside the head tagp  pI find it better for readability to keep script tags inside the head section.p  precodeltscript srcscript.js deferdefergtltscriptgt codepre  porp  precodeltscript deferdefergt   do something  ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 34305 pIve got a clientserver application written in C using WPF.  The database on the server is getting quite large and the application has to load much of its data lets not debate that part of it...just trust me on that and take it for what it is.  I could instead pull the data as needed on demand, however that creates performance issues due to the constant querying back and forth with the remote db.p  pWhat would be great though, is if on application start I could pull down the data I need to the client and store it in a locally running database.  The application then queries the local database, rather than the remote server database.  In this way, the application keeps a low memory footprint, but still has quick access to the data since its local.p  pIs it possible to use SQL Server Express or LocalDB in this manner  i.e. letting them run on the client machines, and syncing with the server database on application start  If so, would this be a recommended or notrecommended use of themp  pThanksp

Here is the latest Index view I triedp  precodemodel CardNumbers.Objects.Client       ViewBag.Title  Clients   lth2gtClientslth2gt  ltbr gt       using Ajax.BeginFormSearch, Client,     new AjaxOptions              HttpMethod  POST,         InsertionMode  InsertionMode.Replace,         UpdateTargetId  ClientsResults                ltfieldsetgt         ltlegendgtSearchltlegendgt         ltlabel forclientNogtClient No ltlabelgt         ltinput typenumber namesearchClientNo classnumericOnly gtltbr gt         ltlabel forclientNamegtClient Name ltlabelgt         ltinput type   text size 25 dataautocompleteUrl.ActionQuickSearch, Client  name searchClientName gt         ltdivgt        ltinput typesubmit valueFind  Refresh gt                     ltinput typebutton valueFind  Refresh idClientsSearch dataurlUrl.ActionClient, Client gt              ltinput typesubmit valueFind  Refresh gt             Ajax.ActionLinkFind  Refresh, Client, new AjaxOptions UpdateTargetId  ClientResults,            InsertionMode  InsertionMode.Replace, HttpMethod  POST                      ltdivgt     ltfieldsetgt           ltdiv stylepaddingleft150px paddingtop50px paddingbottom50px idClientsResultsgt Html.RenderPartialClient, Model                lttable idflexClients styledisplaynonegt   ltdivgt          ltbr gt codepre  pYou can see all the commented attempts here also. So, the Search method in the Clients controller now has this codep  precodepublic ActionResult Searchint searchClientNo  null, string searchClientName  null                       Assume we want to select everything             var clients  Db.Clients  Should set type of clients to IQueryableltClientsgt              if searchClientNo  0  0 Number was supplied                 clients  clients.Wherec gt c.Number  searchClientNo               If clientNo was supplied, clients is now filtered by that. If not, it still has the full list. The following will further filter it.             if String.IsNullOrWhiteSpacesearchClientName  Part of the name was supplied                 clients  clients.Wherec gt c.Name.ContainssearchClientName              return PartialViewClientsSearch, clients             return PartialViewClient, clients          codepre  pThe commented view is the partial view which has a flexigrid and its not working. The ClientsSearch view is the normal index view created by using the template and this works.p  pDo you see what exactly I am missing The flexigrid method is simply not firing at all when I attempt to use it as a partial view from that main view. p

Negative 34305 pMy software receives information from several sensors. The number of sensors is not fixed  they can be added and removed, each sensor one has its own unique identifier. Sensors send data irregularly  they can keep silent for weeks or push data every second. Each sensor generates a value from a fixed set of values  so sensors are discrete. My program logs each message from each sensor into an SQL database table sensorId, time, value.p  pThe task is to filter the information. I need to select only one record from this log, which Im considering to be the actual information. For example, if I get the latest record from a single sensor, which says that value is A, but before it 10 different sensors told me that the value is B, then I shall still consider B to be the actual information. At the same time the problem is not just the usual noise filtering, because if there was one sensor which told me for a month every second that value was C, and then five sensors recently tell that in fact the value is D, I shall immediately consider D to be the actual data despite long history  I want to say that the number of independent sources also must have weight.p  pSo, I think I get a kind of a function of two variables  time ageing and the number of unique sensors in the moment of time. So, I think, I must somehow calculate the weight of each record and then just select the one with the biggest weight. And I suppose that to calculate the record weight I should use not only the information from current record, but information from all the previous ones.p  pI need some help with the algorithm. Maybe there is actually some wellknown solution which Im not aware ofp

Negative 34305 pIs there a way to have different cells in the same column to displayedit data differentlyp  pIm trying to use a data grid to let the user enter values for parameters specified in an XML file.  This would be fairly straightforward, except that some parameters are strings, some are integers, and some are booleans.p  pWhile I could just use a textbox with cell validating events to force the user to enter values that meet the criteria for the parameter, I think it would be more userfriendly to use a text box cell for String parameters, a checkbox cell for Boolean parameters, and a numeric up down cell that I made for Integer parameters.p

Negative 34305 pI am trying to create a Python program that uses the os.system function to create a new process application based on user input... However, this only works when the user inputs notepad.exe. It does not work, for instance, when a user inputs firefox.exe. I know this is a path issue because the error says that the file does not exist. I assume then that Windows has some default path setup for notepad that does allow notepad to run when I ask it to So this leads to my question is there any way to programmatically find the path to any application a user inputs, assuming it does in fact exist I find it hard to believe the only way to open a file is by defining the entire path at some point. Or maybe theres a way that Windows does this for me that I do not know how to access Any help would be great, thanksp

Negative 34305 pFirst question Im creating a website, and everytime I have a method activated, my page reload. All my methods runs at the server They are all ASP.NET codebehind functions. But I would like to have them running at the client, without the client being able to see, or at least have them running without refreshing the page everytime. Is that even possiblep  pSecond question Some people say that it is possible through javaScript, but does the call the function at the server, or does it simply convert the method to running at the client for everyone to see. If its the first, then where can I find a full guide to make this happen. And is it recommended.p

Negative 34305 pSo were running into a problem where the container is holding onto instances of DerivedTypeConstructorSelectorPolicy for the duration of the application. This wouldnt be so bad were it not for the fact that the following two lines of code in TypeInterceptionStrategy wraps the old policy into a new one, which then now holds onto two instances or more, every call to Resolve for an intercepted class will compound the problem. You can see this when running .NET Memory Profiler.p  precodeIConstructorSelectorPolicy originalConstructorSelectorPolicy  PolicyListExtensions.GetltIConstructorSelectorPolicygtcontext.Policies, object context.BuildKey, out containingPolicyList PolicyListExtensions.SetltIConstructorSelectorPolicygtcontainingPolicyList, IConstructorSelectorPolicy new TypeInterceptionStrategy.DerivedTypeConstructorSelectorPolicyproxyType, originalConstructorSelectorPolicy, object context.BuildKey codepre  pThis is causing thrashing of the Gen 2 collection when you have a lot of classes being intercepted and then you get holes in memory that the GC cannot reclaim, especially as policies get copied to ensure thread safety. Once you have a sufficient number of items in the policy list, it will get moved to the LOH, which makes the thrashing even worse.p  pI should caveat this with the fact that our application is running in IIS Classic and not Integrated Pipeline and in 32bit mode, double whammy, I know. With more addressable space in 64bit mode, this wouldnt be so bad. But still, were stuck with the virtual memory that is given to us by IIS and this goes quickly as the GC cant find enough space in the VM map to allocate additional memory and requests start dying.p  pThe file only has 3 revisions, with the original revision looking like it did not have this issue. Has anyone else run into this problem or am I missing something that perhaps explains this behaviorp  pA link to a very simple program that illustrates this is posted on pastebin a hrefhttppastebin.comDYG3GXNm relnofollowhttppastebin.comDYG3GXNmap  pUsing .NET Memory Profiler or your profiler of choice and watching for the DerivedTypeConstructorSelectorPolicy, you can watch it grow through each iteration and as it grows, you can examine and see the originalConstructorSelectorPolicy keeps referencing the old instance in a long chain.p  pAs an example of how many classes we intercept, its on the order of about 1300 or so registrations.p  pTIAp

Negative 34305 pIll be implementing an image service provided by LiquidPixels into a custom Magento extension. This image service generates images based off of image templates and overlaysmaps created using photoshop templates.p  pHere is an example of a url that would be passed to LiquidPixels for image generationp  precodehttpuser.liquifire.comusersettype[none],swatch[none],finish[111]ampcallurl[fileproductssku8530.chain]ampsink codepre  pThis automatically generates an image based on the parameters passed into the URL the above URL is just a dummy one that doesnt work, just so you get an idea of the format that is used.p  pNow, Id like to make an implementation that works off of the select product attributes, pass it to LiquidPixels using the above URL format, get the response which will be an image file, and store it in the Magento cache for later use. This would store the image for a period of a month or so, or until this custom image cache is refreshed.p  pDoes anyone have any advice on the best method to set this up as There are a lot of options and moving parts, and just want to see if anyone has done something similar and has a suggested methodologyapproach to doing this.p  pThanks Markp

Negative 34305 pI am using JFreeChart library to create Chart. I need to present big amount of data on the same chart. Because of that I have many range axes descriptions.

Negative 34305 pSo,p  pI have an app running in a VPC, with currently a VPN connection to the development location.

The VPNcapable router I have aka. client gateway has no BGP capabilities.p  pThe CIDR of the network Im on client network is 192.168.1.024 and on the VPC there is a Virtual Private Gateway vgwA and a corresponding routing rule Destination 192.168.1.024 Target wgwA.p  pI can access the app without any problem all ACLSecurity Groups are properly configured.p  pMy question is what happens when I want to create another VPN connection to a different site, but whose network has the same CIDR block 192.168.1.024 or a CIDR block that might overlap or include it e.g. 192.168.1.016 Is this successful  and will the users on the client networks be able to access the appp  pBasically, what do I need to be capable to make VPN connections to different networks which have the same or partially common CIDR BGPcapable customer gateway Different virtual gateways on the same VPC I dont think that AWS allows that  and it doesnt really make sense Routing rules based on the external IP of the customer gateway e.g. Destination 87.44.75.124 Target vgwA  doesnt really make sensep

Negative 34305 pCurrently in my project I have two static methods codePushObjectscode and codeProcessObjectcode.

An abstract of my codePushObjectscode and codeProcessObjectcodeare given belowp  precode    void fooPushObjectsobj A              try                      Begin Lock                 boostlockguardltboostmutexgt lockmutexpush                 mydeque.pushbackA             End Lock             conditionread.notifyone Inform the reader that it could start reading                   catch stdexceptionamp e                      debugbreak                     This is the static Reader method      void fooProcessObject              Begin Lock             boostuniquelockltboostmutexgt lockmutexprocess             whiletrue                                  whilemydeque.empty  conditionread.waitlock                      try                                              ifmydeque.empty                                                          obj a  mydeque.front                                 ......Process the object........                                 mydeque.popfront                                                                    catch stdexceptionamp e                                              debugbreak                                  end while         End lock      codepre  pFrom what I have read is that iterators become invalid once items are added or removed from the deque. Is there a way to resolve this issue. p

Negative 34305 pI was trying to build gdal1.10.0 a hrefhttptrac.osgeo.orggdalwikiDownloadSource relnofollowhttptrac.osgeo.orggdalwikiDownloadSourcea using mingw64 from a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingwbuildsfileshostwindows relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingwbuildsfileshostwindowsa x644.8.0releaseposixsehrev2.7z. I have compiled gdal1.10.0 under the standard MinGW 32bit version without a problem.p  pThe reason I have to switch to mingw64 is that the standard 32bit MinGW distribution does not support c11 features like codestdthreadcode, and I suspect other features as well. But I get an linking error in the end telling me something aboutp  precodeundefined reference to impGetACP codepre  por a different decorated name if I use the 32bit variant from mingw64mingwbuilds. BTW, I tried different versions of mingw64, including 64bit, 32bit, seh, sjlj, but all gave the same error about codeGetACPcode.p  pI did some homework and found some instructions for a similar compilation task a hrefhttpwww.gaiagis.itspatialite3.0.0BETAmingw64howto.htmlenv relnofollowhttpwww.gaiagis.itspatialite3.0.0BETAmingw64howto.htmlenva According to the above website, it seems that they suggest the problem has to do with WOW64 and the correct version of windows dll files cannot be used because windows automatically determines it for you depending on whether a 32bit or 64bit application making the call. This is supposedly a problem for mingw64 because the compiler gcc is 64bit but msys is hopelessly 32bit.p  pBut since I tried 32bit versions as well, the above does not seem to explain the error. Even more, I tried in a dirty way to comment out all calls to codeGetACPcode, because I dont really care about code pages and all that for my purposes. Strangely enough, compilation is OK on a fresh source just with the codeGetACPcodes commented out, but the same link error is still reported. I checked that codelibkernel32.acode, codelibiconv.acode are in the codelibcode folder, and also followed the instructions in the blog above to copy dlls out from codecwindowssystem32code and place them in mingw subfolders with appropriate renaming. The link error remains. This is where I stopped hacking after spending almost two days on this without success. I cant understand why the entire sourcecode does not contain a single call to the function and I am still getting the link error.p  pCan anyone explain what might have caused this issue between gdal and mingw64, and how to fix itp  pAlso, a general question about mingw64 is that is it really able to support posix functions I see package names such as x644.8.0releaseposixsehrev2.7z, but I remember that the MinGW people said they will never support full posix.p  pP.S.

Negative 34305 pI want to create a hotkey that sends some key, and then another hotkey for that very just sent key, that in turn sends a third key.p  pThat seems to be possible, using a hrefhttpl.autohotkey.netdocscommandsInputLevel.htm relnofollowcodeInputLevelcodeap  precodeInputLevel 1 ab InputLevel 0 bc codepre  pThe above works as intended By pressing strongastrong I get strongcstrong.p  pHowever, I want not only to remap the first key I want to do more before sending the key. So I thought I could just rewrite the above a little bitp  precodeInputLevel 1 Hotkey a, foo InputLevel 0 bc  foo      Do something more here      SendInput Blindb     return codepre  pThe above however does not work as intended By pressing strongastrong I get strongbstrong not strongcstrong.p  pUpdate Robert Ilbrink reminded me that you can execute more than one command, without using the codeHotkeycode commandp  precodeInputLevel 1 a      Do something here      SendEvent Blindb     return InputLevel 0 bc codepre  pThe above does give the intended effect Pressing strongastrong results in strongcstrong. However, I have to rephrase my problem. I guess the problem is I need to set the hotkeys dynamically, which means I have to use the codeHotkeycode command with a label as far as I know. Also notice that I use codeSendEventcode above. Using codeSendInputcode produces a strongbstrong. Odd.p  pEnd of update.p  pI know there is a companion command to codeInputLevelcodea hrefhttpl.autohotkey.netdocscommandsSendLevel.htm relnofollowcodeSendLevelcodeawhich might be relevant. Ive tried putting it many places but it has never made any difference.p  pSo, that was the reduced, theoretical example. Remapping a to b to c is of course useless in reality and the net result could of course be achieved by codeaccode. On to my use case. Just keep in mind that if it turns out that the real solution means doing what Im trying to do some other way, Im still interested in knowing more about codeInputLevelcode and codeSendLevelcode, and why my example does not work as intended.p  pIm working on implementing a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiModifierkeyDualrolekeys relnofollowdualrole modifier keysa. For example, send strongstrong when pressing strongRShiftstrong alone, but strongRShiftemkeyemstrong when pressed together with some other key. Basically, strongRShiftstrong on keydown, and strongRShift upstrong and strongstrong on keyup. However, that has one flaw Even when combining strongRShiftstrong with some other key, strongstrong is still sent. So the script needs to know when there has been a combination. My solution is to add hotkeys to all letter keys, the arrow keys and some other keys, like thisp  precodefor comboKey in filteredComboKeys      Hotkey   comboKey, DualcomboKey    Later in script  DualcomboKey       The following function lets the dualrole modifier keys know that they have       been combined with another key and a few other things, which I dont think      are important for the issue.     Dual.combo        key  Dual.cleanKeyAThisHotkey     SendInput Blindkey      return codepre  pThe above solution works very well for my purposeexcept that the break all remappings and other hotkeys the user might have made These simply never occur.p

Negative 34305 pIm in the process of troubleshooting an issue with a Gridview heavy with checkboxes exported to Excel Sample code below.  Actual code includes more checkboxes.  What happens is that 1 the user clicks the button to begin the export process, then 2 the user either saves or downloads the file to their desktop, 3 the file takes a considerable amount of time to render the basic cells  15 seconds, then once the basic excel file renders 3 the spreadsheet renders the checkboxes render time takes anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes depending on the speed of the computer and appears to hang until the checkboxes appear like they appear in the GridView.p  pI should also note that this sample file is around 800k and I have been able to export other larger gridviews to Excel without the checkboxes almost instantly. p  pI get that the actual exported file from the web page isnt true a Excel file until you save it as a spereadsheetworkbook.  However, this seems a bit odd that a gridview with checkboxes takes so long to render as a spreadsheet. p  pMy question is this  Is this normal behavior for exporting excel spreadsheets heavy with checkboxes or is there some way I can improve the code below to ensure that the Excel spreadsheet doesnt hang for extended periods when opening  Is there any other solution that can help speed the checkbox render timep  paspx codep  precodelt Page TitleTest Page LanguageC MasterPageFileSite.master EnableEventValidationfalse AutoEventWireuptrue CodeFileform2.aspx.cs Inheritsform2 gt

Negative 34305 pAuto Layout, as good as it is, driving me crazy with constraints. I have the portrait mode designed in IB but I cant get the desired landscape orientation to work. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZHPid.jpg altlayoutp  pNotice that when the orientation changes to landscape, the spacing between the UIImageView blocks decreases and the text alignment of codeSAMPLE TEXTcode changes to right aligned. p  pCurrently, I have added a few constraints for it to work. However, I need to keep the space between UIImageView blocks fixed, as a result of which it looks cramped up in portrait and fine in landscape. I need it to be spread out evenly in portrait and compress in landscape like in image above. Similarly, currently my constraints bring up the text but it doesnot keep it at the center of screen and right aligned. p  pIs this possible at all with Auto Layout If so, how Help greatly appreciated.p

I can use VBA to insert the data into a table, but I cant use duplicate field names, so when I go to export this to Excel the field names wont mean anything, and there cant be sections like zone1, zone2, etc.  I can link a report to this, but the report width can only be 22, so I would have to export and then do some vba handling of the excel sheet on the other end to display in a legible way.p  pI can get the data into format 1, is there some way I can get the data to display in one long row based on batch number  Does anyone else have a great idea of how this is doablep  pOpen to any suggestions.

Negative 34305 pthis is my first post so i am sorry if this is confusing at all. I am trying to use a vLookup to run a comparative analysis between two reports. I am using a part number as a reference and trying to return the cost associated with the part from one of the two reports. So, the first issue that I encountered was due to the fact that some of the part numbers had letters in them and some didnt, so to be consistent I used the following code to clean up the part numbersp  pIFERRORVALUEF11ampC11, F11ampC11 p  pwhere F11 and C11 are two components of the part number that needed to be concatenated to generate the full number. Now, the vLookup will not return anything except for NA for a few of the part numbers that are actually in the sheet. All of the part numbers are formatted the same for the 892 part numbers that I am searching for but get a returned value on 571 of the 892 part numbers but of the remaining 321 part numbers that did not have a return, about a third actually exist in my sheet. Lastly and for example, part number 110874402 exists in both sheets but gets a NA from the vLookup. When I copy the value from one sheet and search it in the other sheet using Ctrl  F, I get the followingp  pI have an image to show but apparently cant post it without a reputation of 10 or more...oopsp  pThe highlighted cell shows that the value exists but Excel cant find it. Does anyone have any ideas why this is or what I could be doing differently Ive been having this issue for a few months now on separate projects and havent found any resolution.p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 34305 pIll start with the project idea I have in hand p  blockquote   pWe are trying to make a simple application that requires the sending of messages between phones. Say theres phone A and phone B, and both have installed the application. Phone A sends a message to B through the application, and B receives it.

Every instance of the application registers with the server, the server then saves the ID so it can later use it to communicate to the GCM, and the GCM can use the registration ID to deliver the message to the phone.p  pstrongWhat I dont understand is how phone A will be able to know the ID that corresponds to phone B, in order to tell the server to deliver the message to phone B.strong p  pId really appreciate the help, thanks.p  pstrongEDITTEDstrongp  pBased no the answers, I think Im not managing to express my question properly. p  pI understand that this systems bases itself in three factors a server, GCM, and your device. p  pThe device registers with the server, and the servers saves the devices registration ID which it will, later on, use to send it to the GCM so that the GCM can then send the appropriate message to the device. p  blockquote   pWhat I dont understand is how the following procedure is carried outp blockquote  pPhoneA wants to send a message to PhoneB, so phoneA would send this message to the Server, and the Server would later pass it on to the GCM who would then pass it on to phone B. p  pThis explanation is nice, in the abstract vision of it all. But, stronghow does phoneA tell the server that it wants the message delivered to phoneB. How does phoneA even know what ID corresponds to phoneBstrong p  pHopefully this clears it up.p

Negative 34305 pIm making a port of the AKKA framework for .NET dont take this too serious now, it is a weekend hack of the Actor part of it right nowp  pIm having some problems with the Future support in it. In JavaScala Akka, Futures are to be awaited synchronously with an Await call. Much like the .NET Task.Waitp  pMy goal is to support true async await for this. It works right now, but the continuation is executed on the wrong thread in my current solution.p  pThis is the result when passing a message to one of my actors that contain an await block for a future. As you can see, the actor always executes on the same thread, while the await block executes on a random threadpool thread.p  precodeactor thread 6 await thread 10 actor thread 6 await thread 12 actor thread 6 actor thread 6 await thread 13 ... codepre  pThe actor gets a message using a DataFlow codeBufferBlockltMessagegtcode Or rather, I use RX over the bufferblock to subscribe to messages. It is configured like thisp  precodevar messages  new BufferBlockltMessagegt          BoundedCapacity  100,         TaskScheduler  TaskScheduler.Default,  messages.AsObservable.Subscribethis codepre  pSo far so good.p  pHowever, when I await on a future result. like sop  precodeprotected override void OnReceiveIMessage message      ....      var result  await Asklogger, m      This is not executed on the same thread as the above code     result.Match          .WithltSomeMessagegtt gt         Console.WriteLineawait thread 0,           System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.GetHashCode                 .Default gt Console.WriteLineUnknown message      ... codepre  pI know this is normal behavior of async await, but I really must ensure that only one thread has access to my actor.p  pI dont want the future to run synchronously, I want to to run async just like normal, but I want the continuation to run on the same thread as the message processoractor does.p  pMy code for the future support looks like this p  precodepublic TaskltIMessagegt AskActorRef actor, IMessage message      TaskCompletionSourceltIMessagegt result           new TaskCompletionSourceltIMessagegt     var future  Context.ActorOfltFutureActorgtname  Guid.NewGuid.ToString       once this object gets a response,       we set the result for the task completion source     var futureActorRef  new FutureActorRefresult                 future.Tellnew SetRespondTo, futureActorRef      actor.Tellmessage, future      return result.Task  codepre  pAny ideas what I can do to force the continuation to run on the same thread that started the above codep
Negative 34305 pI am trying to modify the activity below to make use of two AsyncTasks.  The original activity without the AsyncTasks worked and it resulted in a list of small thumbnail images shown in a vertical list of the listview.  But now after I click the button the view just goes blank.  As you can see in the onLoadClicked method, the lines I commented out were just a few and those have been relocated inside the onPostExecute methods of the respective AsyncTasks.  If you can help me understand what I over looked I would appreciate the help.  This is my first time trying to use an AsyncTask.  Also, I would like to later modify the activity future the make use of the onProgressUpdate method at least inside the downloadImagesTask so that the thumbnails would show up one by one as they are loaded instead of all at once at the end, but I am having trouble understanding how to fit in the publishProgress and onProgressUpdate into the current structure.  But fixing the current issue is more pressing for now.  But suggestions for further refinement along these lines would be helpful.

Negative 34305 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI find myself stuck in a situation with some very odd constraints. The .NET project Im working on has a series of convoluted controls layered upon one another. At the lowest level, a SQL query is being constructed, the results of which will ultimately populate a custom data grid.p  pThe pieces of this query are passed into a stored procedure, which ends up constructing executing dynamic SQL under the hood. The sproc is called as followsp  precodeGetPagedResults columnList, fromClause, whereClause, pageNumber, pageSize... codepre  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pMy problem arises from the fact that some of my predecessors wrote some really poor filtering logic. In the most drastic example, they retrieve a list of IDs from the database, whittle them down with some complex filtering logic, and then construct the WHERE clause as followsp  precodeWHERE PrimaryKeyColumn IN list of 1,500 uniqueidentifiers codepre  pThis has resulted in our apps performance taking a serious nosedive. Ive been trying to find ways to rectify the issue while still working within the confines of the stored procedure listed above, since its fragile and deeply ingrained in the codebase.p  pstrongWhat Ive Triedstrongp  pstrong1. Performing a JOIN, and doing all the filtering logic in SQLstrongp  pThe code that they  use to whittle down the list of IDs is hundreds of lines long. Rewriting in with SQL could take days, and I dont have the confidence in our test suite to ensure that what I wrote would be functionally equivalent to the current solution.p  pstrong2. Using a userdefined function in the FROM clausestrongp  pTo replace the massive codeWHERE [column] INcode, I tried creating a userdefined function that would join on the list of IDs, which I formatted as XML, since its a relatively easy way to represent a list. The result made the FROM clause of my query appear like thisp  pcodeFROM MyUdfltrootgtltitem id00000000000000000000000000000000gt...ltrootgtcodep  pAnd my function looked like thisp  precodeALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[MyUdf] idList XML RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN      SELECT s. FROM SomeTable s     JOIN idList.nodesrootitem R nref          ON s.[PrimaryKeyColumn]  nref.valueid,[uniqueidentifier]  codepre  pWhile this ensured that I was creating something functionally equivalent, the performance was abysmal. On average, it was 3x slower than the existing solution for a set of 1,000  uniqueidentifiers. Ouch.p  pstrong3. Doing a straightup JOIN on the inputstrongp  pWhen the UDF failed, I thought that maybe I could simply convert a string of uniqueidentifiers to XML within the SELECT statement, and then join on that. That would give me a FROM clause that looked likep  precodeFROM SomeTable s  JOIN CONVERTXML, ltuuids heregt.nodesrootitem rnref     ON s.PrimaryKeyColumn  nref.valueid,[uniqueidentifier] codepre  pUnfortunately, it doesnt appear as though you can perform a CONVERT between the keywords JOIN and ON.p  pstrong4. Using a table variablestrongp  pI feel like this would be the ideal route, I dont think I can make it work given the constraints. The stored procedure I have to call into will only give me control over the fromClause and whereClause. So I cant include any SQL statements before the SELECT begins to create a table variable and populate it with the IDs to filter on.p  pIf its possible to create and populate such a table emwithinem a SELECT statement, then it might work. But from the reading Ive done, I dont think this is a possibility.p  pstrongSo...strongp  pIm sure theres a way to do this, but given the constraints I have to work under, Im short on ideas. Is there anything I can manipulate in the FROM or WHERE clauses that would allow me to avoid the use of an enormous codeWHERE [column] INcode clausep

Negative 34305 pI have some code that manages data received from an array of sensors.The PIC that controls the sensors uses 8 SARADCs in parallel to read 4096 data bytes. It means it reads the most significant bit for the first 8 bytes then it reads their second bit and so on until the eighth least significant bit.br Basically, for each 8 bytes it reads, it creates and sends forth to the computer 8 bytes as followsp  precode rxData[0]  MSB[7] MSB[6] MSB[5] MSB[4] MSB[3] MSB[2] MSB[1] MSB[0]  rxData[1]  B6[7] B6[6] B6[5] B6[4] B6[3] B6[2] B6[1] B6[0]  rxData[2]  B5[7] B5[6] B5[5] B5[4] B5[3] B5[2] B5[1] B5[0]  rxData[3]  B4[7] B4[6] B4[5] B4[4] B4[3] B4[2] B4[1] B4[0]  rxData[4]  B3[7] B3[6] B3[5] B3[4] B3[3] B3[2] B3[1] B3[0]  rxData[5]  B2[7] B2[6] B2[5] B2[4] B2[3] B2[2] B2[1] B2[0]  rxData[6]  B1[7] B1[6] B1[5] B1[4] B1[3] B1[2] B1[1] B1[0]  rxData[7]  LSB[7] LSB[6] LSB[5] LSB[4] LSB[3] LSB[2] LSB[1] LSB[0] codepre  pThis pattern is repeated for all the 4096 bytes the system reads and I process. br Imagine that each 8 bytes read are taken separately, we can then see them as an 8by8 array of bits. I need to mirror this array around the diagonal going from its bottomleft LSB[7] to its topright MSB[0]. Once this is done, the resulting 8by8 array of bits contains in its rows the correct data bytes read from the sensors. I used to perform this operation on the PIC controller, using left shifts and so on, but that slowed down the system quite a lot. Thus, this operation is now performed on the computer where we process the data, using the following codep  precodeBitArray ba  new BitArrayrxData BitArray ba2  new BitArrayba.Count for int i  0 i lt ba.Count i      ba2[i]  ba[inti  64  1  64  1  i  8  8  inti  8  inti  64  8]  byte[] data  new byte[rxData.Length] ba2.CopyTodata, 0 codepre  pNote that THIS CODE WORKS. br rxData is the received byte array.br The formula I use for the index of ba[] in the loop codes for the mirroring of the arrays I described above.p  pThe size of the array is checked elsewhere to make sure it always contains the correct number 4096 of bytes.p  pSo far this was the background for my problem.p  pIn each processing loop of my system I need to perform that mirroring twice, because my data processing is on the difference between two arrays acquired consecutively. Speed is important for my system possibly the main constraint on the processing, and the mirroring accounts for between 10 and 30 of the execution time of my processing.p  pI would like to know if there are alternative solutions I might compare to my mirroring code and that might allow me to improve performances. Using the BitArrays is the only way I found to address the different bits in the received bytes.p  pThanksp

The primary way customers find products is by filtering down results with a search menu options include department, brand, color, size, etc..p  pThe problem is that the menu creates a lot of duplicate content, which I am afraid will cause problems with search engines like Google and Bing. A product can be found of multiple pages, depending on what combination of filters are used.p  pMy question is, what is the best way to handle the duplicate contentp  pAs far as I can tell, I have a few options 1 Do nothing and let search engines cache everything 2 use a canonical link tag in the header so search engines only cache departments 3 put relnofollow in the filter links though, to be honest Im not sure how that works internally 4 put noindex in the header of filtered pages.p  pAny light that can be shed on this would be great.p

Negative 34305 pIve been endlessly searching for a sliding overlay panel using jquery that doesnt destroy my bootstrap 3 css file. But I cant find any. I need a panel that is like a form, has dropdowns, selectable grids, input boxes, etc.. and anything I do on this menu panel will refresh the content panel automatically but in my case its not really considered a menu, its just a sliding or popout form that you can fill out.p  pIve searched this sitep  pa hrefhttpdesignhuntr.com15slidepaneljqueryplugins relnofollowhttpdesignhuntr.com15slidepaneljquerypluginsap  pAnd not a single one gave me what I wanted. I need a sliding panel that comes from the left, filled up with forms like bootstrap accordion, select2 dropdown.p  pThe first link gave exactly what I wanted, but rendering the content of my bootstrap css came into heavy conflict and was rendered useless.p  pThe most perfect example I was able to find is located herep  pa hrefhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.3.0beta.1docspanels relnofollowhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.3.0beta.1docspanelsap  pWhen you click the overlay button it does exactly what I needed in terms of functionality.p  pBut using this library also conflicts with bootstrap. Ive tried 5 different libraries, all ending in failure. It just seems that a simple idea such as this could have had some kind of leeway by now.p  pIf anyone has had any kind of success, Id love to hear it. Otherwise Im all out of options  at this point.p  p[Edit 6172014] A big requirement for me is to have a button that is kept static, it doesnt move with the sliding panel. I didnt want the user to move the button every time the user slid a panel out. I also needed this functionality to exist for ie7. I want to have more control over what is moving, want is sliding, the effects, everything. Not a total 100 full slide.p

Negative 34305 pI am currently developing my first JAXRS based REST service and in order to access different databases based on the environment I am executing the service on, I added profiles to my codepom.xmlcode. Based on the currently chosen profile I am able to create a configuration file, that lets me establish the connection to the local database. p  pHowever, I also use this information to create a database and tables and load some test data into it using dbunit. The problem is, that the database is created and dropped for all profiles, but I just want to recreate the database for test profiles. If I use production or development profiles the database should just be altered if there have been structural changes to the database tables.p  pSo my question is how I could execute plugin actions based on the currently chosen profile. Therefore please consider the example below. How to alter the executions so they are just executed if I set the profile codetestcode using codemaven clean install P testcodep  precodeltplugingt     ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtsqlmavenpluginltartifactIdgt     ltversiongtsql.maven.plugin.versionltversiongt      lt Specify the dependent jdbc driver gt     ltdependenciesgt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtpostgresqlltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtpostgresqlltartifactIdgt             ltversiongtpostgresql.jdbc.versionltversiongt         ltdependencygt     ltdependenciesgt      lt Common configuration shared by all executions gt     ltconfigurationgt         ltdrivergtdatabase.jdbc.driverClassltdrivergt         lturlgtdatabase.jdbc.connectionURLlturlgt         lt You can comment out usernamepassword configurations and have maven              to look them up in your settings.xml using settingsKey gt         ltusernamegtdatabase.jdbc.usernameltusernamegt         ltpasswordgtdatabase.jdbc.passwordltpasswordgt         ltsettingsKeygtpostgresdbltsettingsKeygt         lt All executions are ignored if Dmaven.test.skiptrue gt         ltskipgtmaven.test.skipltskipgt     ltconfigurationgt      ltexecutionsgt         ltexecutiongt             ltidgtdropdbbeforetestifanyltidgt             ltphasegtprocesstestresourcesltphasegt             ltgoalsgt                 ltgoalgtexecuteltgoalgt             ltgoalsgt             ltconfigurationgt                 lt need another database to drop the targeted one gt                 lturlgtjdbcpostgresqllocalhost5432lturlgt                 ltautocommitgttrueltautocommitgt                 ltsqlCommandgtDROP DATABASE database.jdbc.dbNameltsqlCommandgt                 lt ignore error when database is not available gt                 ltonErrorgtcontinueltonErrorgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltexecutiongt          ltexecutiongt             ltidgtcreatedbltidgt             ltphasegtprocesstestresourcesltphasegt             ltgoalsgt                 ltgoalgtexecuteltgoalgt             ltgoalsgt             ltconfigurationgt                 lturlgtjdbcpostgresqllocalhost5432lturlgt                 lt no transaction gt                 ltautocommitgttrueltautocommitgt                 ltsqlCommandgtCREATE DATABASE database.jdbc.dbNameltsqlCommandgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltexecutiongt          ltexecutiongt             ltidgtcreatetablesltidgt             ltphasegtprocesstestresourcesltphasegt             ltgoalsgt                 ltgoalgtexecuteltgoalgt             ltgoalsgt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltautocommitgttrueltautocommitgt                 ltdelimiterTypegtrowltdelimiterTypegt                 ltsrcFilesgt                     ltsrcFilegtsrcmainsqlspozzschema.sqlltsrcFilegt                 ltsrcFilesgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltexecutiongt     ltexecutionsgt ltplugingt codepre

Negative 34305 pIm trying to add some basic CRUD functionality to MEAN stack. Ive created a RESTful service that works and Im confused about how to wire it all up. I can get it to work, but I want to make sure Im doing things the best way and not creating an unnecessary hack. p  pMy api route for a single Person is like thisp  precode Find one person app.getapipersonid, functionreq, res    Person.find  id req.params.id ,     functionerr, data       res.jsondata            Find group of people  app.getapiperson, functionreq, res      use mongoose to get all people in the database    Person.findfunctionerr, data       res.jsondata     codepre  pThis seems to work in that if I go to a URI with an ID, as in localhost3000apiperson23423434, I see JSON data like thisp  precode[        id 532d8a97e443e72ef3cb3e60,     firstname Horace,     lastname Smith,     age 33    ] codepre  pThis tells me the basic mechanics of my RESTful api are working. Now Id like to display that data with angular in a template like sop  precodelth3gt person.firstname     person.lastname  lth3gt codepre  pTo do that, I just need to create a scope.person object with get or query. Heres the relevant part of my appp  precodeangular.modulecrudApp, [ngRoute, ngResource]   .config[routeProvider, functionrouteProvider     routeProvider       .whenapipersonid,                    templateUrl partialsperson.html,           controller PersonCtrl                ]       .factoryPerson, functionresource         return resourceapipersonid,  id id              .controllerPersonCtrl, functionscope, routeParams, Person          scope.person  Person.get  id routeParams.id    Having trouble here        codepre  pThe trouble Im having is that get fails with an error Error [resourcebadcfg]. On the other hand, if I use Person.query, I get back an array, which means I need to change my template to the followingp  precodelth3gt person[0].firstname     person[0].lastname  lth3gt codepre  pThis works, but seems strange and isnt like what Ive seen in angular tutorials. The only other solution Ive found is to set scope.person in a callbackp  precodePerson.query id routeParams.id  , functionperson   scope.person  person[0]  codepre  pThis works with my original unmodified template. Is it the best or right way to work with RESTful apis like this Is there a better wayp  pAnswer the answer is in comment below. My problem is that api is using Person.find but should be using Person.findOne  id req.params.id  Using findOne returns a single object.p

However, when using the front facing camera it only works 50 of the time.p  pI have narrowed the problem down to the fact that codeself.hasUserTakenAPhotocode does not update to codeYEScode fast enough when using the ront facing camera, and I know because if you look in my 2nd code I posted it has the statement of codeNSLogHas the user taken a photo , self.hasUserTakenAPhotocode.p  pWhen this works correctly, and the user has just pressed the button to capture a photo which also stops the session, the very last time that codeNSLogHas the user taken a photo , self.hasUserTakenAPhotocode runs it will print with the correct value of YES. p  pHowever, when it doesnt work correctly and doesnt update fast enough, the very last time it runs it still prints to the log with a value of codenullcode.p  pAny ideas on why codeself.hasUserTakenAPhotocode does not update fast enough 50 of the time whe using the front facing camera Even if we cant figure that out, it doesnt matter. I just need help then coming up with an alternate solution to this.p  pThanks for the help.p

It also has the TreeLayout algorithm, that I wanted so much, implemented but I cannot manage to change the look of the vertexes. I want them to look like the vertexes that are drawn by JGraph framework, but with JUNG I only get some circles and name of vertex is outside the vertex shape. I have discovered an example that changes the shape of vertex, but the writing is still outside. p  pSo, I would like very much some suggestions about  how can I draw some graph that is in between what I get with these two frameworks Have the name of vertex inside the shape, have the Treelayout and add vertexes as some Object that I can get returned when I click on the vertex.p  pThe answer from Marco13 was very useful. I have figured to make the Rectangles have a size to fit he String by setting String.length  10 for the width of the Rectangle.p  pI think this may be useful for someone else trying to make a graph like this Instead of  that appears in most generic classes in this example can be used whatever Object is needed, String is for Vertex and Integer is for Edge type. Inside the Transformer functions you get the Object that is assigned for the Vertex or Edge. Like this, I could set different shapes, colors and fonts for objects with some specific properties.p  pI work to figure how to make a MouseListener that returns the Edge Object when I click on it but I hope that will be easy.p

I have been able to come up with regular expressions, which almost do the job, but are not quite adequate to handle every instance I encounter, where fields are switched around or optionally omitted.p  pI am realizing from this, that I do not know how to designate regex group position when order of occurrence is more sophisticated than just a sequence.p  pAn example of one of these complicated templates is that of term, documented on the following page a hrefhttpen.wiktionary.orgwikiTemplate3aterm relnofollowhttpen.wiktionary.orgwikiTemplatetermap  pMy best stab at the regex omitting, for now, the extra escape characters needed to make the string Java compatible is the followingp  precodeterm..[w, ]lang[w]scwtr[w, ]poswlit[w, ] codepre  pThis works for genuine examples of term templates encountered such asp  precodetermlogoswordlanggrc termverbumverbfor the wordlangla termberto carrylanginepro termalternative lifestylelangen termalreadylangyitrshoyn termBggegoblin, snotlangnds termas codepre  pBut it fails to work properly for the followingp  precodetermdeus ex mchindeviceposnlitgod from a devicelangla termfishtrrbascCyrllangsh termlangyitrshoyn termlangenvocational codepre  pTheres got to be a way of specifying that some groups are positional and some can appear randomly, instead of just optionally in a specific sequence. This should be, for instance, a common issue when processing many HTML elements. I would very much appreciate any advice on how to write the regex to deal with this positional sophistication. Thanks so much  Jeff.p
Negative 34305 pIve created a server program which, when it receives some commands, executes some actions. Id like when it receives the command android which happens when a client connects from an android device that my server launches a shell script and when the client disconnects Id like it to stop the execution of this script.p  pAlso, when a web browser clients connects and send the command browser the server would launch an other script.p  pThose two scripts cant be used at the same time because they use the same resources. Thats why I need to stop them when a client disconnects Im aware that I cant have the two types of clients connected at the same time.p  pFor now, Ive been able to launch the scripts, but not to stop them.

All my managed beans have session scope.p  pMy problem is, when i open a new dialog and click in any link inside, my application still works fine, but after this, if i click in other link in my index page to open another dialog, the app shows me a codeViewExpiredExceptioncode. I have tried update my jsf to 2.0, set codeEnableRestoreView11Compatibilitycode in codeweb.xmlcode to true, use codekeepAlivecode in my beans, but nothing works. p  pI think its happened because i have a main page with one state and, when i click to open a new page in a jquery dialog, it loads the entire page and put the html inside. So, the request made no reference to the state of main page. How can i resolve thisp

Negative 34305 pI have a theoretical decision model of the following typep  prhat  r  rbar  deviations from meanp  pif rhatlt0  11erhatdeltatp  pand if rhat0 111erhatgammatp  pTherefore, the model is an Sshaped curve with an asymmetry about 0 captured by gamma and delta. The slope of the curve is determined by t. p  pI have data for rhat and would like to fit the above Scurve to the CDF of the data to get estimates of delta, gamma, and t. I usually think about this problem as a binary choice problem, but my data is not of that type. It is more along the lines of finding distribution parameters. Should I recover the empirical cdf data for this estimation e.g. using Mathematicas HistogramList commandp
Negative 34305 pIm looking for some input here.  I have a singleton class that contains a value which is updated every few seconds by a method within that class.  Right now, access to this value across multiple threads is done via synchronization, which I would like to eliminate.

Does that make sensep  pDoes it even need to be synchronized at all if all of the other threads are only allowed to read it  Ive run a boatload of JUnit tests on this, creating many instances of the DataSegment class all printing values like crazy and I have yet to see any concurrency issues.p

Then I try to somehow force the separate GMM to fit separate classes. If two clusters are far away for example, cluster1 and cluster 3 in this example, there is no problem to use Amros method to combine all the data and then do a GMM fitting. However, when we do the training on the image data, it will never be perfect to separate background from object due to the limitation of the resolution caused partial volume effect therefore, it is very likely we have the case of cluster1 overlapped with cluster2 as shown.

Then the packet is transmitted to the remote end. When the remote user receives the audio packet, it just plays it using regular java sound api. The playback is NOT done via flash. My question is Does AEC works if flash is used only for recording and not playbackp

Negative 34305 pI have a report with many paremeters to filter the data presented in the report. One of the parameters is MainContact. This is a multivalue parameter.

The original report is unaffected, and continues to show the contact name.p  pI have tried CASTing the BIGINT values as NVARCHAR20 in my dataset but this makes no difference.p  pAny idea how to resolve this problem as the values are meaningless to the reports usersp  pI am using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Shell Integrated Version 11.0.61030.0 Q11REL Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.5.50938 Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Applications 2012   04932004001700602018 Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services Designers Version 11.0.3402.0 and deploying reports to a SQL Server 2012 version 11.0.3000p

Negative 34305 pI have a Ruby command line application which runs for a few minutes. During the execution, I print out several messages to the command line output, after each phase of the application is complete.p  pThis is only to let the user know, which phase the application is running in and to make the application more informative.p  pNow, I want to port the application to a Sinatra app. I have the whole framework up and ready. I am using jQuery AJAX to print the output results back to the user.p  pThe problem is, it only renders the output once the whole application has run and thus, makes it nonreponsive compared to the commandline app. In some cases, it might even take 23 minutes for the whole application to run and then print the results to the webpage.p  pThis is equivalent to doing a POST and I am gaining nothing from jQuery AJAX call here.

Negative 34305 pIm working on an application that authenticates users using 3rd party services Facebook, Google, etc.. I give each user an internal id uuid v4 which is associated with their 3rd party ids. Right now, my mongoose user document model looks something like thisp  precodevar user  new mongoose.Schema     uuid type String, required true, unique true, index true, alias userId,     fbid type String, required false, index true, alias facebookId,     gid type String, required false, index true, alias googleId  codepre  pBecause I can query on any IDs, I need indexes on all of them. Im thinking that this can become an issue with a large amount of users or if I add more 3rd party logins Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.. Now, my question is whether this is the correct way to do this, or if there is a better solution.p  pOne idea I had is having multiple collections, one per ID type. Something like thisp  precodevar user  new mongoose.Schema     uuid type String, required true, unique true, index true, alias userId,   var facebookUser  new mongoose.Schema     fbid type String, required false, index true, alias facebookId,     userId type Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref user  codepre  pThis has the advantage of not cluttering the user model and easier sharding, however it means more queries to retrieve a user and even more to create a new user 1. check in facebookUser collection if a user exists, if not, create a new user, save it, then create a new facebookUser with a link towards that new user and then save that.p  pWhich way is better scales well, handles load, etc.p

All tests should run independently, so execution order is not important.p  pI have thought about adding custom attributes, likep  precode[TestDisplayIndex  1] public void FirstTest  ...  codepre  p... but to me this seems not very friendly to the developer, especially if you have 50 tests and you want to insert one somewhere in the middle, or if you forget to add a display index somewhere.p  pIs there another cleaner, more robust way of specifying or influencing the display order, or am I stuck with attributesp

Negative 34305 pI am working on a hrefhttpssswam.wordpress.com20120710thompsonsshell relnofollowa flowbased programming system called net2sha.  It is currently based on shell tools connected by named pipes.  Several processes work together to get the job done, communicating over named pipes, not unlike a production line in a factory.p  pIn general it is working delightfully well, however there is one major problem with it.  In the case where processes are communicating over two or more named pipes, the sending process and receiving process must open the pipes in the same order.  This is because when a process opens a named pipe, it blocks until the other end has also been opened.p  pI want a way to avoid this, without spawning extra helper processes for each pipe, without having to hack existing components, and without having to mess with the program networks to avoid this problem.p  pIdeally I am looking for some nonblocking fifo option, where open on a fifo always succeeds immediately but subsequent operations may block if the pipe buffer is full or empty, for read... Id even consider using a kernel patch to that effect.  According to fifo7 ONONBLOCK does do something different when opening fifos, not what I want exactly, and in order to use that I would have to rewrite every existing shell tool such as cat.p  pHere is a minimal example which deadlocksp  precodemkfifo a b gt a gt b  amp lt b lt a  amp wait codepre  pIf you can help me to solve this sensibly I will be very gratefulp

Negative 34305 pFirstly, my code is just a demo of my multiplayer game 2 or more players can play simultaneously to demonstrate my problem without any extra things. I have successfully implemented peertopeer P2P communication in my game. Later, I decided to add support for clientserver communication ie a central server which is also a player in my game. It should be much easier than P2P. But strange Unfortunately Im facing the problem which I have no clue to solve it Now here is the problemp  pSuppose, I have 1 server and some clients may be 1 or more clients.

Negative 34305 pI am wondering how to find the pair of variables in a table that give the highest values.p  pFor instance, I have this file mydata with 5 numeric columns. If I run codecormydatacode it will show me all the possible correlations. I want to know those pairs that are highly correlated. I tried using codesortcormydatacode, but understandibly this gives me a vector of the ordered values. How can I then know what pair is responsible for a certain valuep  pPS Im not sure how to insert an example, I tried posting pictures but dont have the necessary points p  pLets say that if I have a table with 2 variables A and B, the output of sorting would bep  p[1] 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0p  pIn this case its easy to know that 0.5 comes from the pair A and B, but how could I know this when more than 2 variables are involved p  pThanks in advance..

Negative 34305 pI have implemented multitouch dragging of SKSpriteNodes on my game.p  pIt is working, but of course, there is a bug.p  pIn the iOS simulator,  Case 1 if I drag a node around the viewable screen, then continue to drag the node off the viewable screen, it will disappear and then continue to drag the node back onto the screen it will appear properly. This is good. It only works if I do it slowly.p  pCase 2 If I do the exact same movement as mentioned in Case 1 except this time I do it very quickly, the node, when it reappears on the screen will stick to a spot on the screen. I have not yet ended the touch at this point, i.e. the mouse button is still being held down. On the simulator it looks like I am dragging nothing around.p  pThe intended behaviour is once the touch starts, create the node at the touched location working good, drag the node around working and then if the node is dragged off the screen, the touch should end, and the node should be deleted.p  pThe nodes and touches are being tracked in a dictionary array.p  pIn the screen shot, I clicked once, the node appeared, held down the entire time and started dragging it off and onto the left side of the screen quickly many times. It created many nodes that should have disappeared. If I drag slowly off the screen then back onto the screen, it wont make extra nodes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comixIvx.png altThis is the problemp  pI have placed a simplified version of my code on GitHub for you to try out the issue for yourself.

Negative 34305 pI am trying to building a linear layout programmatically, in which, there are 4 buttons in all, each of the button simply positioned below the previous button. Just like the picture shows belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQi1vN.png altenter image description herep  pAnd as you can see from the picture above, each button has exactly the same size but they have different layoutmargins, the first button has a larger value in layoutmarginTop while the other 3 buttons has the same value in layoutmarginTop.p  pBasically to build a layout like this by xml is very simple but now I have really come across difficulties in building all this only through java code. I have gone through many posts and now I can easily add 4 buttons in proper sizes but I just could not find a proper way to programmatically set the layoutmargin for each of the button. p  pTo simple add four buttons, I could do like thisp  precodepublic class mainActivity extends Activity   Called when the activity is first created.  Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     LinearLayout layout  new LinearLayoutthis     layout.setOrientationLinearLayout.VERTICAL  Can also be done in xml by androidorientationvertical      for int i  0 i lt 3 i          LinearLayout row  new LinearLayoutthis         row.setLayoutParamsnew LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT          for int j  0 j lt 4 j              Button btnTag  new Buttonthis             btnTag.setLayoutParamsnew LayoutParamsLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT             btnTag.setTextButton   j  1  i  4              btnTag.setIdj  1  i  4             row.addViewbtnTag                   layout.addViewrow          setContentViewlayout     setContentViewR.layout.main   codepre  pAnd to programmatically set margins for each buttonview, I could do like thisp  precodeLinearLayout.LayoutParams params  new LinearLayout.LayoutParams             LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT params.setMargins0, 2, 0, 0 button.setLayoutParamsparams  codepre  pBut here comes the problem as long as I setLayoutParams for the 4 buttons, and then add 4 buttons into Linearlayout by addViewbutton, only the first button could be displayed in the proper size with the proper margins. All the other 3 buttons just disappeared. And With many tests I just found it seems that only one layoutParams could be allowed in a linearlayout object. As a result, as long as I set different layout params for different buttons, only the first button could be displayed. But since here the margin params for my 4 buttons are definitely different thus I think I have to use different layoutparams for different buttons.p  pSo pls anyone tell me how could I programmatically set the margin for my each of my buttons and make them display properlly This has already sucked my life for two days, pls help p

Negative 34305 pOK, I have been working on a couple of demo project with libgdx, but I did not have an android device at that time, so I could not test them. I recently bought a tablet and I decided to see if my projects ran on the device connected by USB.p  pI enabled the USB debugging mode, created a new libgdx project and tested. It works. So the problem is not the connection, but the other projects I am trying to run.p  pThe first project was written while reading the libgdx book. Since by the time I first codded the app I had to reinstall my computer, my android version increased and it was a pain to make it work again with the new version. So it could be the source of the problem. Running as desktop works fine, running as android gives me the following errorsp  blockquote   p[20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Dx warning Ignoring   InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class   com.sun.jna.win32.W32APIOptions2 that doesnt come with an   associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced   by a compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The   recommended solution is to recompile the class from source, using an   uptodate compiler and without specifying any target type options.   The consequence of ignoring this warning is that reflective operations   on this class will incorrectly indicate that it is emnotem an inner   class.p blockquote  pIt gives me 15 copies of that message because there are 15 classes in the core project.  I tried cleaning all projects but it did not works. Then the errors continue with thisp  blockquote   p[20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Dx  trouble processing   javaxxmlnamespaceQName.classp      pIlladvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax. when   not building a core library.p      pThis is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in   your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If   you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this   is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p      pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core   namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a   nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not   work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with   future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable   legality.p      pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only   appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution,   as opposed to compiling an application  then use the   corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p      pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an   application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail   to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers   who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once   they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this   problem.p      pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core   package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage   that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package   namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core   system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.   If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that   the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief,   and lamentation.p      p[20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Dx 1 error aborting   [20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Conversion to Dalvik   format failed with error 1p blockquote  hr  pThen I also have a second app which was started on my new installed computer.

It is an iOS only app. In testing the App successfully sends out App invites and receives a response in the delegate methodp  precodevoidappInviteDialogFBSDKAppInviteDialog appInviteDialog didCompleteWithResultsNSDictionary results codepre  pthe response is didComplete  1 which confirms this. I have also  tested the App link attached to the Invite to check it works, if the app is not installed Facebook tries to find it on the App store, if it is installed the link opens the app. Ive tried using Test users who are not enabled on the app, ive also tried assigning real accounts with tester roles. Neither receive the invite. This is version 1.0 of the app, so its not currently in the app store, therefore it is not possible to set the iPhone Store ID setting on the Facebook App settings page. Does the app need to be live in the Apple app store before users receive an invite I would have thought test userstesters would still receive an invite even if its not live in the Apple App StoreIf not, Facebook documentation doesnt seem to mention this anywhere.p  pIve been researching what might be wrong, but cant seem to sort this out. There are similar questions on Stack overflow, but none that match exactly for this case and SDK version. The solutions suggested in the similar cases dont work for me either. I would simply comment on those existing questions, but i dont have enough reputation points to commentPlease helpp

Negative 34305 pIm showing a triangle next to some text inside of a container with codedisplayflexcode. The texts width is not known at design time. The browser will calculate the width needed for it upon rendering. Ive provided code below which highlights my scenario.p  pThe issue Im encountering p  ul liOn initial render code.triangletwocodes position is not correctly determined. The browser appears to not know the width of code.textcode quite yet and so it incorrectly positions code.triangletwocode until a second rendering pass occurs. Just a moment after rendering code.triangletwocode shifts to its correct position.li ul  pBy contrast, code.triangleonecode does not exhibit this issue at all. I presume that this is because code.triangleonecode is rendered as text, and thus in the same pass as code.textcode where as code.triangletwocode is rendered at a different pointintime making it ineligible for the proper positioning.p  pOf note, if I apply codejustifycontent flexendcode to code.containercode then this issue does not occur because code.triangletwocode is positioned first and then code.textcode. So, its a nonissue when going the other direction.p  pIs this a common problem Are there any more elegant solutionsp  pstrongNotestrong Im unable to reproduce the issue with my example provided, but Im unsure why.

Negative 34305 pWhen a list is sliced, are the references to its contents copied from the original list I can imagine that this may not be necessary, but I read the opposite a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma513156342973mentioned in passinga.p  pThis question matters for instance for the following idiom, in the case of a very long codemylistcodep  precodefor firstelmt, secondelmt in itertools.izipmylist[1], mylist[1]      codepre  pA copy would use up both memory and, presumably, some time. I compared to looping over the index of codefirstelmtcode with codexrangecode, on a list of 100 million integers. The slicing approach is actually 20 faster, but does seem to copy references the system time is longer. Is this indeed the casep  pstrongPSstrong I now realize that it is quite natural that slices copy the references if the original list is modified, the slice does not change, so it is easier to have the implementation of the slice copy the references of the original list. A pointer to the CPython implementation would be interesting, though.p

The video is in the codeltsectiongtcode area and the codeltasidegtcode is right in between the codeltsectiongtcode and the codeltfootergtcode. Not next to the video. So if you ran the code, you would see the video and a big and empty space right next to it. And then the aside would be in the location I described previously.

Negative 34305 pI am using Tkinter to build a basic text editor. I have a small File menu with four buttons Open, Save, New File, and Exit. The main part of the window is devoted to the editor and some buttons pop up occasionally saving, opening, etc. However, I have a couple of problems 1 When I attempt to close the main window with the exit button on the window border, it splits itself into the main window in one window and the menu in a smaller window. Everything remains fully functional, but I have to close two windows to terminate the program. emWhen I use the exit button in the menu this does not happen.em 2 My second problem is unrelated to the question title, but my code is here so I have four items coded into the menu section, but only three are showing up. The fourth only appears when the above phenomenon occurs. Why is it doing that and how can I fix itp  pThanks very much My description of the phenomena probably will be insufficient, so here is a link to a picture of what I am describing a hrefhttpsgoo.glvjwI5X relnofollowhttpsgoo.glvjwI5Xa You can see in the top right hand corner the window is black this is the main text editor but no menuright next to it is the menu, in the smaller window, along with all buttons that happen to be open at the time. p  pHere is the my code p  precodefrom Tkinter import  import sys import menuconfig import tkMessageBox import errormes  Variables that are globally needed fileinput   whats put into the text box FILE  File the user wants to open readapt to be synonymous with save openafile   will be the entry field for opening a file target   newfile   newfilename   def getfromtext     global fileinput     try         fileinput  mytextbox.get1.0, END         print fileinput     except         fileinput  UHOH         print fileinput  def save     global fileinput, FILE, target, FILE     fileinput  mytextbox.get1.0, END     target  openFILE, rw     target.truncate     target.writefileinput  def exitapplication     sys.exit0  def menuopenfile     global FILE, openafile, save     try         openafile  Entry         openafile.gridrow  3, column  0         openafile.insert0, Path to File to Open         save.gridforget         Buttonmain, text  Click to Open, command  getfile.gridrow  4,                                                                      column  0     except         tkMessageBox.showinfoError Code 52, Something went wrong.         errormes.error  def getfile     global FILE, openafile     FILE  openafile.get     target  openFILE, rw     openedfile  target.read     try         mytextbox.insertINSERT, openedfile     except         tkMessageBox.showinfoThis is wrong, Something went wrong  def newfile     global newfile     mytextbox.delete1.0, END     try         newfile  Entry         newfile.gridrow  3, column  0         newfile.insert0, Path to new file  name         Buttonmain, text  Click to Save, command  savenewfile.gridrow  4,                                                                      column  0     except         tkMessageBox.showinfoError Code 52, Something went wrong.  def savenewfile     global newfile, newfilename     newfilename  newfile.get    mytextbox  Textbg  black, fg  white, insertbackground  white mytextbox.gridrow  0, column  0    def main     main  Tk     The Menu      firstmenu  Menumain     main.configmenu  firstmenu     fileMenu  Menufirstmenu     fileMenu.addcommandlabel  Open, command  menuopenfile     fileMenu.addcommandlabel  New File..., command  newfile     fileMenu.addcommandlabel  Save, command  save     fileMenu.addcommandlabel  Exit, command  exitapplication     firstmenu.addcascadelabel  File, menu  fileMenu      savebutton  Buttonmain, text  Save, command  save     savebutton.gridrow  3, column  0     main.mainloop  if name  main     main codepre  pThe module codeerrormescode is one I created...sorry for any confusion.

Negative 34305 pI am running into the following problem with MeteorJS and onInput events acting on a MongoDB document.p  pIn the DB I have a Collection whose elements each contain an array. The array contains objects which have properties including codeidcode and codeinputValuecode. I want to display each objects codeinputValuecode in an HTML codeinputcode field. I would also like that when the user deletes all the content of an input field, the corresponding object in the array gets deleted through an onInput event and that the arrays contents get redisplayed.p  pThis should be straightforward in Meteor and below is the code Im using. However Im running into the following problemp  pWhen two or more objects in the array initially have an identical codeinputValuecode such as in the code below the two aaa strings, the array does not get reactively redisplayed properly. Id expect to be left with one input field containing aaa, but the field is empty.p  pThis does not happen when it is the last of the identical inputs value that gets deleted the second aaa in this case, nor when the values are different changing in the code one of the aaas to aba for example makes it work as expected.

I could use codestduniqueptrltT[]gtcode or codestdvectorltTgtcode instead, but the problem is that then there is double dynamic allocation, double indirection, and extra cache misses per each tree node.

Negative 34305 pAt the moment we have two development teams.  One of them is in a different country.  The master svn server is in location A.  The development team in location A has access to this server and creates branches from trunk and does their development.  The team in location B works off of the same trunk but does not have access to the master svn server.p  pLocation B needs to have the latest trunk in order to create their branches.  They do not need to have write to trunk.p  pWhat I am looking to do is have only trunk synced from location A to location B.  But from location B have only their branches synced to location A.    p  pI also want to keep syncing all location A to a disaster recovery site.p  pThe recommendations I have read state that for the mirrored svn server, nothing but the svnsync tool should write to this server.  But I would assume that is referring to both servers writing to the same branchtrunk.  If that does not happen, is there still a danger  Can the svnsync tool accomplish what I am looking to dop  pThanksp

Negative 34305 pI just want to know that can we define properties in an .sql file or not. The reason that why i want to define a property in the .sql file is for managing version of the database.p  pFor example I am using HSQL Database. Currently there are two tables.  Table 1 Products.br Table 2 version. it contains just an integer number. p  pNow what i want is that when my program runs, it checks if version has been changedupgraded so it can drop the existing db, and upgrade the database according to the new schema and index statements written in an .sql file. p  pBut the issue i am facing is that at the startup of the program , i can read the existing version from the version table, but against which version value i would compare it.  Because all that would be written in the .sql file would be.p  precodeCreate table products ... Create table version ... Insert into products values ... Insert into version values2,9192015 the upgraded version. codepre  pSo either i should parse the version statement written in the end  of the sql file to extract the version number and compare it with the existing version to check if version has been changed or how else can i do itp  pSo i thought that may be somehow i can define a property in .sql file. Like this.p  precodeversion  2 Create table products ... Create table version ... Insert into products values ... Insert into version values2,9192015 the upgraded version. codepre  pand then first read the version and compare it. If it is upgraded then run the rest of sql queries. p  pI mean, is this a good approach to manage version in an database using java. Or how else can i do itp  pMany Thanks.p

Negative 34305 pThe remote device is sending live raw PCM audiono header included in UDP packets and I need to implement a program in java to receive these packets and play them on the PC live. As I know that raw PCMs attributes are 16bit, mono, sampling rate 24KHz, so I tried to add a wav header to this raw PCM audio and play but the problem is I dont have File size of the audio.p  pI also implemented a program based on a hrefhttpwww.wikijava.orgwikiPlayawavesoundinJava relnofollowthis linka but it only gives noise in output.p  pI am bound to use UDP and I can get only raw PCM from remote device, so is their any library or API by which I can play this raw audio on PCp
