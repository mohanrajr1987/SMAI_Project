Positive 5868 pWe are trying to build a web application whose data updates in realtime. In order to do this we were thinking to use socketio.p  pSo the plan wasp  ol liA socket requests updates for a certain entitytype say users perhaps because it is displaying a list of users on the screen. li liCheck permissions of socket by using the userId and assuming that it is allowed to see users add it to a users room.li liWhen another client changes the users view Update, Insert or Delete emit an event to the users room with the updated user attached.li ol  pHowever, we have run into a problem that we have not been able to solvep  pHow can we possibly know if another view has changed Since our application pulls from views which are calculated objects, if a client updates viewA, it is totally possible that a row in viewB has changed as well due to them sharing underlying tables. If there is a second client socket in the viewB room, it will not get its updated viewB entity and will go out of sync with the db.p  pEven if we stored in session a hash of views to underlying tables and used it to predict which views may have changed on update, we still wouldnt know which row specifically had changedp  pLooking for ideas or approaches, all thoughts welcome. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 5868 pBack to my first swift app, Im doing the sign insign up part, and basically the design with the view controllers so far arep  pstrongWelcome screen sign insign up buttons  Sign in  Sign up  Main Programstrongp  pI got to the part where in the sign up view controllers, if the user misses one of the required field blanks and they click the button submit, they will be prompted and back to the current view controller sign up to fill the missing fields. Now I want to set that when all the fields are filled, what line of code can I use so when they click the button submit it will head back to the welcome screen, so they can sign in afterwardsp  pSimilarly, I got all the the part to check if the user enters correct user name and password, so when they entered the wrong info, they will be prompted and hack to the current view controller sign in, and how can I do so if they entered the correct user name  password, it will head to the main program view controller the 4th onep  pIf what I said above is confusing, Ill post my current controllers and the related code in here. Anyone has any idea Again, this is my first program so itd mean very much if I can get some helps from you. Thank you for reading.p

WaveControl wc4 ...  wc1.minus.setOnclickListenerthis wc2.plus.setOnclickListenerthis .... this for every button  Override public void OnClickView v     View parent  Viewv.getParent     int id  parent.getId     Log.iTAG, view id  id    wc1 id   field1.getId     switchv.getId        case R.id.minus           ...        codepre  pThe output is codeIWaveFragment view id 1   wc1 id 2131624083code Clearly this cant serve me as an indicator which was the view being clicked. I have figured a workaround in just making several onClickListeners for each waveControl field, but it doesnt seem like the perfect solution. And still the problem is there  casting a ViewParent to a View will not get you the actual id of the view as laid in the fragment. Any prompts why this is happening would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 5868 pWhen you a set a propertys value, you can either validate before or after updating the internal value.p  pIf validating before, you could throw an exception if the new value is invalid.  The object is then always in a valid state.p  pIf validating after, undo is desired i.e. via strongemIEditableObjectemstrong, so the user can cancel the edit any time.  We also have the option of either throwing an exception here or expose errors via strongemIDataErrorInfoemstrong.p  pI dont think strongemIDataErrorInfoemstrong makes sense if validating before the set. Some also may argue throwing an Exception is not warranted in validation scenarios.p  pValidating after works great in scenarios where the custom object is contained in BindingList and set as datasource to a grid.p  pValidating before works ok with grids too but you kind of have to throw an exception in order to signal the setting of the property value failed to the data grid without a lot of extra codep  pI am also not comfortable with my domain objects implementing strongemIEditableObjectemstrong and strongemIDataErrorInfoemstrong, strongemINotifyPropertyChangedemstrong, etc.  It leaves the domain object cluttered with extra concerns.

Negative 5868 pI have a Java application that I need to integrate our existing PHP website with. The vendor wants us to do a serverside redirect to allow for secure authentication and singlesignon, but Im not sure how to do that in PHP. The vendor explained the workflow as followsp  ol liUser clicks on a Open Application link on our PHP siteli liThe PHP application hits a page on the Java application, sending the authentication parametersli liIf successful, the PHP application sends the headers back to the users browser, which forces a redirect, otherwise the PHP app displays an errorli ol  pWhat this will allow would be for our PHP app to securely talk to the Java app, and the client never has to send any sort of authentication.p  pFrom what I understand, .NET and Java have this capability built in, but I cant find a way in PHP to do this. Any ideas p  pbUPDATEbp  pIm not talking about using the headerLocation ... function to do a redirect. The kicker with this serverside redirect is that the app does the authentication and sends all that information back to the client so that the client is then logged in. Using headerLocation ... just forces the browser to go elsewhere.p  pbUPDATE 2bp  pautologin.php Simulates the user logging into an external app via curlp  precode The login form is at login.php ch  curlinithttpdomain.locallogin.php  We are posting 2 variables, and returning the transfer just so it doesnt dump out  Headers are processed by the callback function processHeaders curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHEADER, false curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHEADERFUNCTION, processHeaders curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOST, true curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS, usernameuseramppasswordpass curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true  Execute curl, close the connection, and redirect the user to a restricted page response    curlexecch curlclosech headerLocation httpdomain.localrestricted.php  function processHeadersch, header       Dump the response headers to the client     headerheader     strlenheader  codepre  plogin.php Contains the login formp  precodesessionstart ifPOST      ifPOST[username]  user ampamp POST[password]  pass          SESSION[auth]  1         SESSION[token]  md5time      else          echo Auth failed       else      echo Invalid access type  codepre  prestricted.php Restricted pagep  precodesessionstart ifSESSION[auth]      echo Secret Token .SESSION[token]  else      echo Please log in  codepre  pThe idea is that the user wants to ultimately get to restricted.php. login.php contains the code necessary to log in.

Negative 5868 pIm doing a small relational database, to be used by one person on a single computer.

Negative 5868 pbr I have a search box where you can enter plain text. The keywords are separated by spaces. I check each keyword if it fits the format for a date and store all keywords in one array and date keywords in another. All the date keywords are also in the all keywords array, as I can not tell if its only a date or maybe also a description or name. I search over many fields like name, description, etc...p  pI use something likep  precodeSELECT  FROM Tbl WHERE NOT EXISTS     SELECT  FROM SearchItems WHERE NOT      name LIKE SItem OR     description LIKE SItem OR     field3 LIKE SItem  codepre  pThis searches for entries, where no searchitems exist, that are not found  Means, it shows only items, where all searchitems are found in any field. I use these two NOTs because otherwise I would have to check if the count of found items  count of all items.p  pBut now I have a problem with the dates. Because 100505 is a date but could also be a number in the description. So I want to get all items where there is a 100505 in one of the normal fields, or the date matches the specific date.p  pBut if i add somehting likep  precodeAND NOT EXISTS     SELECT  FROM DateItems WHERE NOT     date  DItem  codepre  pIt means, that the item needs to have 100505 as string in a field AND as date, but if I use OR, it means that all item with the right day will be shown, regardless of the other keywords. If I delete the datekeywords from the allkeywords it would not find the string in the description.p  pHow to fix this I want to get all items from the date, or with the date in description when I enter 100505 but if I enter blue 100505 blue has to be in one of the fields and 100505 could be in a normal field OR the date.p  pstrongEditstrong I forgot to mention In the allkeywords array, the dates are in original format like 100505. The keywords realized as dates are stored in the datekeywords array in ISO format 20050510.

Any help or resources that you know of would be stronggreatlystrong appreciated.p  pstrongHow My Application Currently Worksstrongp  pThe way that my current application works is that I capture points from where the mouse cursor is while the user holds down the left mouse button. A list of points then gets feed to a the gesture recognizer and it then spits out what it thinks to be the best shapegesture that cooresponds to the captured points. p  pstrongMy Ideastrongp  pWhat I wanted to do is before I feed the points to the gesture recognizer is to somehow go through all the points and break them down into separate lines or curves. This way I could feed each linecurve in one at a time and from the basic movements of down, up, left, right, diagonals, and curves I could determine the final shapegesture. p  pOne way I thought would be good in determining if there are separate lines in my list of points is sampling groups of points and looking at their slope. If the slope of a sampled group of points differed X from some other group of sampled points then it would be safe to assume that there is indeed a separate line present. p  pstrongWhat I Think Are Possible Problems In My Thinkingstrongp  ul lipWhere do I determine the end of a line and the start of a separate line If I was to use the idea of checking the slope of a group of points and then determined that there was a separate line present that doesnt mean I nessecarily found the slope of a separate line. For example if you were to draw a straight edged L with a right angle and sample the slope of the points around the corner of the L you would see that the slope would give resonable indication that there is a separate line present but those points dont correspond to the start of a separate line.pli lipHow to deal with the ever changing slope of a curved line The gesture recognizer that I use handles curves already in the way I want it too. But I dont want my method that I use to determine separate lines keep on looking for these so called separate lines in a curve because its slope is changing all the time when I sample groups of points. Would I just stop sampling points once the slope changed more than X so many times in a rowpli lipIm not using the correct type of math for determining separate lines. Math isnt my strongest subject but I did do some research. I tried to look into Dot Products and see if that would point me in some direction, but I dont know if it will. Has anyone used Dot Prodcuts for doing something like this or some other methodpli ul  pstrongFinal Thoughts, Remarks, And Thanksstrongp  pPart of my problem I feel like is that I dont know how to compeletly ask my question. I wouldnt be surprised if this problem has already been asked in one way or another and a solution exist that can be Googled. But my search results on Google didnt provide any solutions as I just dont know exactly how to ask my question yet. If you feel like it is confusing please let me know where and why and I will help clarify it. In doing so maybe my searches on Google will become more precise and I will be able to find a solution. p  pI just want to say thanks again for reading my post. I know its long but didnt really know where else to ask it. Imma talk with some other people around the office but all of my best solutions I have used throughout school have come from the StackOverflow community so I owe much thanks to you.p  pstrongEdits To This Poststrongp  p76 400 PM Another idea I thought about was comparing all the points before a MinMax point. For example, if I moved the mouse downards then upwards, my starting point would be the current Max point while the point where I start moving the mouse back upwards would be my min point. I could then go ahead and look to see if there are any points after the min point and if so say that there could be a new potential line. I dunno how well this will work on other shapes like stars but thats another thing Im going to look into.  Has anyone done something similar to this beforep
Negative 5868 pIm parsing an input stream coming from Facebook. Im using something likep  precodeBufferedReader in      new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderurl.openStream, UTF8 codepre  pAnd then codein.readLinecode to actually read from the stream.p  pThe stream seems to have Unicode characters already encoded in ASCII, so I see things like u00e4 with u actually being two discrete ASCII characters. Right now, Im fishing for u and decoding the subsequent two hex bytes, turn them into a char and replace the string with them, which is obviously the worst way to do it.p  pIm sure theres a cool way to use a native function to decode the special characters as the stream is being read I was hoping it could be done on the InputStreamReader layer.

A simple URL parser functions always assumes the 2nd param from www.projectnamemodule as the search keyword hello in this case and similarly for other params. In this example exam filter is not applicable and so it is left blank and it does not break URL but is it nice.

The function will parse each every name value pair and so the term searchkeyword appearing as value for some other pair will not interfere.pli ol  pPlease consider the following factors while suggesting  SEO friendliness  ease of maintainability considering new filters may be added in futurep  pPlease give some tips on improving SEO friendliness.

Negative 5868 pI want to gitpush a directory full of binary data to a remote server. p  pAs this may take days, I commit locally and push one file at a time if I commit everything at once and push, if the transfer is interrupted, it has to be restarted from the beginning, right.p  pWhen everything is transferred, I want to squash all these commits into one. If I squash locally and then push, all the data is being transmitted again which defeats the purpose of my strategy.p  pMaybe I could log into the remote, and repeat the squash operation remotely, but is there a better way of doing what I want to do. How to inform git that all the sensible data is already on the serverp

Negative 5868 pI have a simple page in a PHPMySQL web application that lets admin users edit HTML template emails stored in the database. Essentially to edit a template the user types into a textarea and submits a form which posts back to the same page.p  pWhen the form is submitted, a PHP function gets called that updates the record in the database by means of a parameterised query to a MySQL stored function.p  pFinally the record is retreived from the database and the information is displayed on the page  this step also happens when the page is being displayed for the first time.p  pThe problem I am having is that although the record is being updated in the database before it is retrieved for display, the page is still displaying the old data from before the update when it is rendered. Other things on the page, such as the banner message saying the update was successful strongDOstrong get updated, so I dont think its a browser caching problem. Adding the line sleep1 after the record update solves the problem so the page shows the updated record, but for performance reasons this isnt ideal, and I dont understand why this problem is happening in the first place. p  pHere is the PHP code from the top of the pagep  precoderequireonceincludesglobal.php requireonceincludesemailtemplateutils.php  strMsg    lngEmailTemplatePK  ConvertToStringGET[key], 0  if ConvertToStringPOST[hdnSave]  1       strFromAddress  ConvertToStringPOST[txtFromAddress]     strSubjectLine  ConvertToStringPOST[txtSubjectLine]     strBodyHTML  ConvertToStringPOST[txtBodyHTML]      if EmailTemplateUpdatelngEmailTemplatePK, strFromAddress, strSubjectLine, strBodyHTML               strMsg  FormatMsgEmail template updated.           else               strMsg  FormatErrorMsgCould not save email template          objEmailTemplate  EmailTemplateDisplaylngEmailTemplatePK codepre  pThis is the code of the EmailTemplateUpdate function which actually does the updatep  precodefunction EmailTemplateUpdatelngEmailTemplatePK, strFromAddress, strSubjectLine, strBodyHTML       objConn  new mysqlicstrGlobalDbServer, cstrGlobalDbUsername, cstrGlobalDbPassword, cstrGlobalDbCatalog      if mysqliconnecterrno              printfConnect failed sn, mysqliconnecterror         exit           strQuery  SELECT srfEmailTemplateUpdate, , ,       objStmt  objConngtpreparestrQuery      objStmtgtbindparamisss, lngEmailTemplatePK, EmptyToNullstrFromAddress, EmptyToNullstrSubjectLine, EmptyToNullstrBodyHTML      objStmtgtexecute      objStmtgtbindresultlngRetVal      objStmtgtfetch      objStmtgtclose      objConngtclose      return lngRetVal  1   codepre  pThe function for retrieving the record for display is a bit more convoluted but essentially just brings back the record as an object using mysqli fetchobjectp  pPlease help.p

Negative 5868 pIve seen this effect on numerous apps, including the YouTube, Fandango, the iPod movie player, Netflix app, the list goes on and on...  They are displaying navigation controller UI, and you choose to play a movie from a button on the current view controller, and then the nav bar as well as the view controller both slide down off the screen in unison, then the video player is revealed.p  pThe only way I know how to acheive this effect is if the current view controller with the play button was loaded via presentModalViewController, then calling dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES will do the trick.  However, the above are not doing this, as I can clearly see the current view controller sliding in from the right, which is typical behavior resulting from a call to pushViewController from the navigation controller.p  pAny ideasp

A widespread find for .o files doesnt reveal anything relevant, so the libraries arent getting lost, theyre definitely not being built.p  pSome supplementary points p  ul liwhen Ive asked about this on the Apple dev forums, its been suggested that I should add explicit deps  in the main targets Build PhasesTarget Dependencies editor. But you can only add deps here to targets in the emsameem project or subprojects in my case I have the app and library projects as workplace siblings.li liif I build each library manually before the main build, all is fine.li ul  h3Updateh3  pIve just figured out a workaround, which is to add all the deps targets into the build part of the main apps scheme. I had tried this before without success, but hadnt realised that I could drag the targets around in the list to get the right build order. Builds now happen in the correct order, both after a clean, and after changes in either library or main app source.p  pIm leaving the question here, because  manually sorting out a build order surely shouldnt be necessary. There has to be something wrong with how I have things set up.p
Negative 5868 pThere is a page on my site with two sets of tabs, each tabs link is ajaxdriven but has a proper href in case javascript is not enabled.  Im about to implement an ajax backbutton solution using a plugin such as jQuery Address.p  pMy problemconfusion with this solution is that a pages default content is still loaded before the javascript has a chance to parse the hash and load the correct content.  If I initially hide the content, nonjavascript users will never see anything.  If I dont initially hide the content, the user will see the wrong page for a moment before it gets updated besides the extra overhead of first loading the wrong tab and then the correct tab.p  pWhat are the best  most common approaches to dealing with thisp  pThanks, Brianp

Negative 5868 pI am using OpenMP to go through a large loop in parallel. Lets say the array Im working on has N entries in total. I would like one thread to do the first N2 entries and the other thread the last N2. p  pI have to avoid that the threads work on entries that are next to each other.

Negative 5868 pIm in the process of porting an app originally developed on iOS to Android.  Im trying to accomplish the followingp  ul lievery time the app is started, call the start method on a Manager classli lievery time the user leaves the app, call the stop method on the same Manager classli lievery time the user comes back to the app resuming from idle, call the start method on the Manager classli ul  pThe socalled Manager class handshakes with a server on the Internet and needs to do a variety of bookkeeping activities every time the user the user enters and leaves the app.p  pWhereas iOS enables you to subclass the UIAppDelegate class and have code that runs when the app starts, ends, or resumes from idle, it seems Android doesnt have an equivalent approach.  Instead, these are the options with Androidp  p1 Activity class methods for every time an Activity view is created, stopped, or resumedbr 2 Application class onStart and onDestroy for every time the app is started or killedbr 3 Service mechanism to create a background task that can be used to perform longliving operations in the background while the app is active or even while its not activep  pNone of the above align real well with what Im used to in iOS.  Option 1 would require every Activity in the apps view hierarchy to have code that runs when the app startsstopsresumes.  Of the 3, I sense option 3 is more relevant.  Im just not entirely clear how I could startstop a service in Android as the user startsstopsresumes an app without regard to the specific activity theyre on at the time.p  pI would appreciate input from Android developers or developers that work on both iOS and Android.p

Negative 5868 pI have read the Struts 2 documentation concerning dynamic results, but in the examples shown i can only influence result parameters, not the result type itself.p  pIs it possible to programatically define the result type for an action for example i would like to create a database which maps results Strings into correct types. In this case the result type is not known on the application startup, struts 2 should determine the result type and its parameters each time the action is executed by querying the database.p  pIs it possible to realize this scenariop

Negative 5868 pIm not new to programming, but I am relatively new to C. I would like to distribute simple console applications so I can help others as I learn. The vast majority of machines on the campus of my university are windows based, and have the Borland compiler installed by default. I prefer to do my development on a Linuxbased system with g and other tools. So Id like to add some crossplatform way of leaving the program running until the user presses enter. That way, the user is able to view the output even if he or she double clicked on the exe rather than running it in the console in windows. To do this, I wrote something similar top  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  int main       float val1, val2     bool wait  true      cout ltlt Please enter the first value to add      cin gtgt val1     cout ltlt Please enter the second value to add      cin gtgt val2     cout ltlt Result  ltlt val1  val2 ltlt endl ltlt endl      cout ltlt Press enter to exit...      while wait              if cin.get  n             wait  false           return 0  codepre  pUsing the code above, the program exits after displaying the result. However, if you comment out the cin calls, it works as expected. This leads me to believe that cin.getline is picking up my enter key press from my last data entry. I suspect this is due to the tightness of the loop. I have learned that there is no crossplatform sleep function in C, so that is not an option. What else can I do to make this work    p

Negative 5868 pIm using Apache ActiveMQ 5.5 and have the following scenariop  pEmbedded Brokerp  pNonPersistent Producer and Topicp  pA consumer of the topic.p  pThe normal stuff is working  I publish to a topic and a subscriber consumes from it.p  pIve implemented a MessageListener, so when a consumer subscribes and unsubscribes, I print something to indicate that. When I have to close the consumer, I just call its close method.p  pSometimes the consumer closes successfully  I see the log and memory usage is fine.p  pBut sometimes it doesnt close, though I can see in the log that I called the close method. This time in the log the MessageListener doesnt mention how the subcriber unsubscribed. And as a result, the memory usage just goes up, because now publisher is sending messages to the topic and Ive closed the consumer which is not really closed  and stopped handling the messages.p  pSo Im not sure where and how to troubleshoot this issue......

Negative 5868 pQUESTION Is there a way to export a DataTable to XML when the DataTable has a Column of type Control. I get an error stating that the controls cannot be serialized. I have read up on the whole concept of serialized and DataContacts from various sources but I am still thinking there may be a much easier solution at hand that I am over looking.p  pBACKSTORY I have a C application that  I am creating, the controls of the application are recycled between different viewsi.e. When you load one view the application uses the same objects those objects then carry out different tasks, like for instances a button object named abutton may be used to submit a form in one view but when in another view it may be used to save the document. To make this ever more complicated the controls are disabled once used but only within that particular view to stop me from doing the same thing twice. The controls and whether they are enabled is kept track of by a DataTable I create for each view. Once the view is selected the application loads the view then uses the DataTable for that view to determine which controls have been disabled. The DataTables for each view have the following Columns  ObjectName  Name of the Object Control  This is of Control type and the actual object is stored in this column Enabled  Boolean value that reflects whether the object is enabled, the default is truep  pHaving the Control Type Column and saving the object to it makes it much easier when traversing through the DataTable to enabledisable the controls for that particular view, I know that I could take out the Control column and work around it but I really do not want to have to do that if there is a simple way to export the XML file. p
Negative 5868 pI am using C to create new computer accounts.  My goal is to allow IT helpdesk personnel to add computers to the domain safely in the right OU.  The way I intended to do this was to have them use a tool that would take the relevant information and create the account in Active Directory.  So far, this all works great.  There is only one snag  I cant figure out how to grant my workers the rights to join the computer to the domain.  Normally in Active Directory you could change the group that is allowed to join the new computer to the domain.  I am using DirectoryServices.AccountManagement and I cannot figure out how to do the same in code.p  pHere is my codep  precodePrincipalContext oPrincipalContext  GetPrincipalContextsOU  The password is just a random construction.

However, you still need to be granted the rights to add a computer to the domain in order to hook a computer up to this account.  I cant find the code to do so.p  pAs a side note, I understand that I could grant my helpdesk personnel the permission to join computers to the domain.  The problem, though, is that they would be able to do so without using this tool.  They wouldnt realize that when they do that, they are sending the computers to the wrong OUs.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHere is an updated picture to show you what I am trying to accomplish in code.

The problem is that the pointer vec8w m is strongnotstrong 128 bytes aligned, so I get a seg fault when movdqa is being executed.  My question is whether there is a way to instruct the inline assembler to use movdqu instead of movdqa that it uses by default I tried to look for a workaround using SSE intrinsic functions for g, but somehow I cannot find movdqu in xmmintrin.h file where it should be declared, I suppose.  Unfortunately, I cannot modify the code so that the function is always called for an strongalignedstrong argument m.   p

An important point here is that this dictionary should contain entries where the Lookup is referenced by at least one document, i.e., the list codeDocumentIDscode should have Count  0.p  pMy task is populate this dictionary efficiently.  So the simple approach would bep  precode  SELECT dl.LookupID, l.Name, dl.DocumentID   FROM DocumentLookup dl   INNER JOIN Lookup l ON l.LookupID  dl.LookupID   INNER JOIN Document d ON d.DocumentID  dl.LookupID   WHERE d.PreviousID IS NULL   ORDER BY dl.LookupID, dl.DocumentID codepre  pThis could then be used to populate a the dictionary fairly efficiently.p  pstrongThe Questionstrong strikeDoes the underlying rowset delivery TDS perform some optimization  It seems to me that queries that denormalise data are very common hence the possiblity that field values dont change from one row to the next is high, hence it would make sense to optomise the stream by not sending field values that havent changed.  Does anyone know whether such an optomisation is in placestrike  Optomisation does not appear to exist.p  pWhat more sophisticated query could I use to eliminate the duplication Im think specifically of repeating the name value  Ive heard of such a thing a nested rowset, can that sort of thing be generated Would it be more performant How would I access it in .NETp  pI would perform two queries one to populate the Lookup dictionary then a second to populate the ditionary lists.  I would then add code to knock out the unused Lookup entires.  However imagine I got my predictions wrong and Lookup ended up being 1 Million rows with only a quarter actually referenced by any documentp

Negative 5868 pAre there any simple, effective answers to this... aside from, Decide which is more important, that is.p  pLet me elaborate. I want a fixed size array. It represents session slots that can be opened for a socket server to accept clients. There are a limited number of these four, at present. p  pPerhaps from a C perspective my question is all wrong. Perhaps I should be considering these as session slots which, while filled with session objects, may not necessarily be usable until a given session has a reference to a connected TCP socket.  This differs from most dynamic languages where I could simply specify the session slots as null until such time as a session fills that slot in the array.p

Negative 5868 pI wish to pass a bunch of unknown values to an Oracle stored procedure from a spring java application.  The data is somewhat structured, so currently we have a stored proc that has accepts 2 clobs what are keyvalue pairs of the data. The first clob represents a single record amd the second clob, represents many child records of clob 1.p  pThis seems a very inefficient way to pass the data as we have to construct strings in java in the forst plave and then the data has to be parsed in the stored proc.p  pI have looked into Oracle record structures, however it appears as though you have to map each field in the record structure to a db table field.  the problem with this approach is a the data items that we send each time differ although there is a core set of data that remains the same and b some of the data items are there for decision making purposes only and are not actualy persisted to the database.p  pSo my question is what is the most efficient vehicle to pass such data to the Oracle stored proc  We want to maintain the flexibilty of being able to send variable parameter sets along with having some semblance of structure around the data.p  pThanks in advance.p  pBarry p

The proposal is all done online and is PHP. What my issue is the field guys will not always have internet available to them when they are filling out what they do so I need a way for them to be able to see what the proposal is for and then fill out what they did and save it locally. Then when internet is available for it to update the online MySQL with what they did. I am looking at exporting the proposal to XML and emailing it to the field person so my hope is they can import it into the c and see what they are suppose to be doing. Then do the job filling out what they really did and send it back to the database once online. p

Negative 5868 pI was debugging a situation last night where running lighttpd and fastcgi was causing a 500 error when I was uploading files. A closer inspection showed that files were indeed being uploaded, and even saved to the Mongo database backend, but it was still throwing a 500 error.p  pSo today I switched over to apache, which we have had working on another system, yet the error still occurs, and instead an empty response is presented. After a bit of investigation, I found that it appears to happen when saving the file to the Mongo database. My code is as followsp  precodefile  Filecreate filegtsavearrayfilegtdata[file] codepre  pIt appears to be fine when creating the file, however on saving the file data, it emseemsem to go into the database without issue, but I dont think it returns properly.

I can also verify that as before the constructor the command codebtcodereturns a correct backtrace, where after the critical assignment the backtrace is corrupted.p  pSo my question is Why does in one case the compiler or the linker reserve not enough space for the array, while in the other case that is not happeningp  pPS Both test cases are compiled with the same compiler and flags and alsolinked against the same object files.p  peditp  pHere is the simple test case that works without seg faultp  precodevoid testMatrix22    FrameworkMathMatrix22 matrix  codepre  pThe code with creates a seg fault is in the class codeModuleShaddowercode intermixed header and implementationp  precodeclass ModuleShaddower     public         ModuleShaddowerPVModuleamp module, const EnvironmentalSetupamp setup, const Positionamp position     private         Matrix22 rotMatrix90   ModuleShaddowerModuleShaddowerPVModuleamp module, const EnvironmentalSetupamp setup, const Positionamp position    module module, positionposition, setupsetup, loggerLoggerFactorygetLoggerInstance      double mat[][2]  0, 1,1, 0  This line will never be reached     rotMatrix90  Matrix22mat  codepre  pAs you see, it is quite from within the rest.

However I realised that I should do this every time I put in logic like this, and that Id only see such issues at run time rather than compile time.br Im wonderring if theres some code I can add to get the compiler to tell the developer that they need to update certain methods in the case that they update enum values  beyond just adding comments to the enum itselfp  pe.g. the example belows purely theoretical I chose statuses from the development lifecycle to ensure its something familiar to most.p  precodepublic enum DevelopmentStatusEnum      Development     , QA this may be added at some point in the future or any other status could be     , SIT     , UAT     , Production       public class Example              public void ExampleMethodDevelopmentStatusEnum status                      switch status                              case DevelopmentStatusEnum.Development DoSomething break                 case DevelopmentStatusEnum.SIT DoSomething break                 case DevelopmentStatusEnum.UAT DoSomething break                 case DevelopmentStatusEnum.Production DoSomething break                 default throw new StupidProgrammerException Id like the compiler to ensure that this line never runs, even if a programmer edits the values available to the enum, alerting the program to add a new case statement for the new enum value                               public void DoSomething            public class StupidProgrammerException InvalidOperationException   codepre  pThis is a bit academic, but I can see it as being useful in making my app robust.

Because I have xlt2 in my for loop, it should only make two threads  one where it runs WriteNumber0, and one where it runs WriteNumber1, which means that I should end up with 1000 0s and 1000 1s on my screen in varying order depending on how the threads are ultimately executed.p  pWhat I end up with is 2000 2s. The two possible solutions that Ive come up with are Ive missed something glaringly obvious, or sending the variable x to the WriteNumber function is doing a passbyreference and not passbyvalue, so that when the threads execute theyre using the most recent version of x instead of what it was at the time that the function was set. However, it was my understanding that variables are passed by value by default in C, and only passed by reference if you include ref in your parameter.p

Negative 5868 pI have a view which implements freehand drawing, but I have a small problem.  I noticed on the iPad 3 that everything went to hell, so I tried to update my drawing code probably as I should have done in the first place to only update the portion that was stroked.  However, the first stroke after open, and the first stroke after about 10 seconds of idle are extremely slow.  After everything is warmed up it is smooth as butter and only takes about 0.15ms per drawRect.  I dont know why, but the whole view rectangle is getting marked as dirty for the first drawRect, and the first drawRect after idle then it takes about 150 ms to update.  The stack trace shows that my rectangle is being overridden by codeCABackingStoreUpdatecodep  pI tried not drawing the layer if the rectangle was huge, but then my entire context goes blank will reappear as I draw over the old areas like a lotto ticket.  Does anyone have any idea what goes on with UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext  Thats the only place I can imagine the trouble is.  That is, my views context got yanked by the context genie so it needs to render itself fully again.

Negative 5868 pI am using CORS to call a cross domain API, however Internet Explorer is giving issues. CORS should be possible in IE8 and IE9 through the codeXDomainRequestcode object, however I cant get things to work..p  pJQuery a hrefhttpbugs.jquery.comticket8283refusesa to provide native support for XDomainRequest, however several jQuery plugins are suggested to add this support. This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10232017ie9jqueryajaxwithcorsreturnsaccessisdeniedtopica suggest two such plugins a hrefhttpsgithub.comMoonScriptjQueryajaxTransportXDomainRequestblobmasterjQuery.XDomainRequest.jsjQuery.XDomainRequest.jsa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comtlianzaajaxHooksblobmastersrcajaxxdr.jsxdr.jsa, which has been reported to work. Afaik, the plugins should automatically override behavior of codejQuery.ajaxcode. I found another plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comOveacorsblobmastersrcmainresourcescomoveacorsjquery.ie.cors.jsherea.p  pI put a little demo pages with the respective plugins a hrefhttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroencorstest1.htmljQuery.XDomainRequesta and a hrefhttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroencorstest2.htmlxdra and a hrefhttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroencorstest3.htmljquery.ie.corsa that perform ajax requests to a CORS enabled server. The pages are working in Chrome and Firefox, however IE89 instantly throw a permission denied error even before making the request. This a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSiewebdevelopmentthread30ef3add767c4436b8a9f1ca19b4812eMSDN posta suggest adding another handler codexhr.onprogress  function code but I tried this and it isnt working either.p  pAny clues what I am doing wrong I have also tested with IE8 now using MS virtual server, but it has exactly the same problem.p  pEdit OK so I figured out that part of the problem was that I was using POST over HTTPS. Apparently XDomainRequest does not allow CORS over HTTPS. I can switch to HTTP but I really need POST. p  pEdit2 See a hrefhttpsgithub.comMoonScriptjQueryajaxTransportXDomainRequestissues1this issue on githuba for the end of this story. It turns out that when using HTTP POST, the xDomainRequest can only encode the request body arguments as codetextplaincode. This pretty much makes it worthless, because everyone uses codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode or codemultipartformdatacode. p  pSummary I highly recommend not investing any time in XDomainRequest, because it is a terribly poor implementation with many limitations. It basically only really works for GET requests to nonssl servers, so you might as well use codejsonpcode or whatever.p

Perhaps there is a way to access the pdb modules own internals to get the line number  p  pOr a roundabout way would be to write something that calls list once, parses the output to extract the current line, then executes a new list command, I wonder if anyone has done this already   Is this how IDEs manage to get the current line information from pdb or are they using its internals I wonderp

We need a historian database that is capable of collecting data from equipment at the rate of 1000 updates  sec on an average. And there will be one equipment for each historian database. Given this requirement, which is the best suited historian database for my requirement  I had looked at many options including OSISofts PI System, Wonderware historian, Canary logger from canary labs, GE proficy, Iconics hyperhistorian and so on. This link helped me  a hrefhttpwww.linkedin.comgroupsHistorianComparison39667.S.50536264 relnofollowHistorian Comparisonap  pBut the biggest problem I have is that these historians are highly scalable databases which means it can collect the whole factory data. So, using this for one equipment with say 500 datapoints might be overkill and expensive. p  pI am wondering if you guys can help me with the list of historian databases that can fit my need. p

Negative 5868 pI intend to us the ToString method for creating a cache key. This cache will be used to cache method level invocations and the key will be constructed by using the parameters names and corresponding values. Since this caching is going to be built for a large library I do not have the ability to ensure that every method has only value type parameters or all classes implement serialization. I need to determine at run time that the call to ToString is returning an actual value versus the type name so that that method invocation can be disallowed from participation in the caching. p  pfor Instance, consider the following method and its invocationp  precodeAccountDetails GetDetailsint groupId, Account account      var ac1  new Account accountId  123      var ac2  new Account accountId  555      var return1  GetDetails15, ac1     var return2  GetDetails15, ac2  codepre  pIn this case i would construct cache key as groupId15accountnamespace.Account causing an incorrect collision.

However, as I inspect in eclipse the mMeasuredWidth of the two elements or even the return value of getWidth, they turn out to be exactly the same. This shouldnt be the case. My understanding is that the children of dataTable should push it to assume their own width given its wrapcontent setting. Conversely, dataTableContainer should be smaller than that, given its fillparent setting which is constrained by the screen size.p  pIve also tried with clipChildren set to false, just in case the width gets clipped by the container but the result remain the same both table and container have the same width.p  pCan anybody explain whats going on p  pTo give you some context, what Im trying to do is to gather the sizes of these elements to determine how much of the dataTable element lies outside of the container and therefore unseen. This in turn is needed to limit how far the user can drag the table element. ScrollView elements limit the motion natively, but as Im using a LinearLayout I need to replicate that limiting functionality.p

Negative 5868 pIm working on an android application and made 120 frames that mimic a custom countdown. The two animations I need to overlay is the custom countdown and an actual timer. I looked into AnimationSet, but ran into the issue of making an Animation object, where I had to add 120 frames before actually using it, which caused an out of memory exception. The second approach was to use LayerDrawable and show frame by frame. There I ran into the problem of knowing which frames to show and when. p  pAny help will be much appreciated, thanks in advancep
Negative 5868 pI want a program that parses a XMLfile, build a structure with the tags I need and finally print a HTMLreport using HTMLtemplates with keywords that get replaced by the data from the XML files.

After that I want to call a print function which prints everything as HTMLreport.p  ol liIm not sure how to report the tags to the data objectli liCould I store the tags in one object which stores a tree of structs or would it be better to store each tag in a separate objectli ol  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 5868 pWith iOS6 there is AutoLayout, which is a constraints based layout system. I guess it is somewhat comparable to Androids flexible XML layouts. p  pI am kicking off an iOS6 project and want to you AutoLayout. This app will be universal. It will have some views that are extremely similar between 2 device families. Others views on the iPad will be 2 or more controllers in the iPhone views.p  pFrom what I understand, UIViewControllers can be setup with other child UIViewControllers. This means theres 2 ingredients to building a universal view in both devices.p  pSo my question is, why is there a need for 2 storyboards I can see that the iPad storyboard has some additional controls etc. Theres also problems of scaling font sizes and other variables between the two device types. Can anyone offer advice on how to not have duplicated views on 2 storyboards and use AutoLayout efficiently to achieve a good universal appp  pMuch appreciated.p

The sessions ID is the same as the pid of the process that created the session through the setsid system call. That process is known as the session leader for that session group. All of that processs descendants are then members of that session unless they specifically remove themselves from it. The setsid function does not take any arguments and returns the new session ID.p blockquote  pWhat the article doesnt say is when the OS decides to terminate a users sessions. My initial assumption was that when someone logs into a TTY, the TTY is the session leader and all processes invoked in that session belong to it unless they call codesetsidcode.

Negative 5868 pI am having a problem getting my program to check the input previous and compare it so the user cannot duplicate an order number. Right now the program will run all the way through and look the way I want, but it accepts duplicate order numbers while I would like it to inform the user and ask them to reenter. The problem seems to be that my check[y] array does not contain any value when I compare it. How do I get this array to contain the previously entered order numbers so it will display the error message. I am just going to post the entire code so you can see what I have done so far. Others have suggested the List type, but I am a student and have not learned this yet. I believe I am supposed to use the Equals method.

Negative 5868 pI am working on a project with a build that is automated using NAnt.  The automated build includes NAnt tasks to clean the machine, including deleting and recreating the virtual directory, clearing out VSWebCache, etc.  Once the machine is reset, it attempts to compile the site with thisp  precodeltexec programvisualstudio.install.dirdevenv.com commandlineSolutionFile.sln failonerrortruegt codepre  pThe problem is that the automated build locks up at this point.p  pIf I open the .sln file interactively, the first thing that happens is Visual Studio prompts me with a dialog box.  I suspect this dialog box is opening invisibly when I run the NAnt script and I cant click on it to proceed.  p  pThe dialog message isp  precodeMicrosoft Visual Studio  The web URL is currently configured for use with ASP.NET 1.1.

I cant configure the site ahead of time because the build script will blow away my configuration anyway.

Negative 5868 pI am developing a web application using servlet API 3.0 and AJAX. Ive developed and tested locally using runjettyrun in Eclipse and it seems to work fine. When I deploy to my Tomcat7 instance, however, I get a codeNullPointerExceptioncode from a call to codegetPartcode.p  pMy setup is the followingp  pI have a run of the mill servlet does not have the codeMultipartConfigcode annotation.p  pIn my codedoPostcode, I am checking for an activity parameter which tells the servlet what the user was trying to do and determines the next course of action. I understand that in multipartformdata requests these exist as part of the stream, so Ive written a helper method to abstract that. In short, it tries to get it as a parameter, and if it doesnt find it, assumes its a multipart request, so it calls codegetPartactivitycode to get that part, and read the value from the parts InputStream.p  pNow, locally on RJR, I have no problem executing this code. The servlet is able to receive the activity parameter in both the normal requests and the multipart requests. I then deploy remotely to a Tomcat7 instance. After testing the application, the normal requests work, but when the multipart requests arrive, they throw a null pointer exception when I call codereq.getPartactivity.getInputStreamcodep  pI guess the crux of my question boils down to whether or not it is possible to properly receive both multipartformdata as well as normal requests in the same servlet. p  pAlso, this shouldnt make a difference, but when I deploy and test remotely, I am using an SSH tunnel to route traffic to the tomcat instances port.p

Negative 5868 pIve googled a significant amount on this, and Im fairly comfortable with JBoss ESB and Camel.p  pIve defined a Camel Mail endpoint, and my goal is to extract attachments from emails for the purpose of using them for contentbased routing.p  pThe Camel integration in JB ESB is a bit of a black box, but basically, the body content of the email is ending up on the message body in the default location as a String.  If its a plaintext or HTML email, this is fine and I can work with it.  But if there are multiple attachments, Camel will provide a javax.mail.internet.MimeMultiPart which is finep  pThe problem is that JBoss ESB is trying to force this to a String, or so it seems, because the message body default location is emliterallyem a string object with the value of e.g. javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart100600  When I try to cast the body to a mimeMultipart,via javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart mime MimeMultipartmessage.getBody.get, I get the predictable exception java.lang.ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipartp  pHow do I access the different parts of a MIME Multipart message that was inbounded into JBoss ESB using camel mailp  pmany thanks, AGMp  pCamelMail 2.10p  pJboss ESB 5.3.1p  pWindows Environmentp  pReplicated on colleagues machinep  precode103954,808 INFO  [STDOUT] Body Name is org.jboss.soa.esb.message.defaultEntry 103954,809 INFO  [STDOUT] Body Class is class java.lang.String 103954,809 INFO  [STDOUT] Attempting to display body contents via toString 103954,809 INFO  [STDOUT] body value is javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart150ce1d 103954,809 INFO  [STDOUT] javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart150ce1d 103954,809 INFO  [STDOUT] class java.lang.String 103954,809 INFO  [STDOUT] class java.lang.String 103954,810 ERROR [STDERR] java.lang.ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart 103954,810 ERROR [STDERR]     at com.XXX.integration.actions.GetAttachment.processGetAttachment.java23 103954,810 ERROR [STDERR]     at org.jboss.soa.esb.listeners.message.ActionProcessingPipeline.processPipelineActionProcessingPipeline.java667 103954,810 ERROR [STDERR]     at org.jboss.soa.esb.listeners.message.ActionProcessingPipeline.processPipelineActionProcessingPipeline.java614 103954,811 ERROR [STDERR]     at org.jboss.soa.esb.listeners.message.ActionProcessingPipeline.processActionProcessingPipeline.java442 103954,811 ERROR [STDERR]     at org.jboss.soa.esb.listeners.message.MessageAwareListenerTransactionalRunner.runMessageAwareListener.java587 103954,811 ERROR [STDERR]     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runTaskThreadPoolExecutor.java886 103954,811 ERROR [STDERR]     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java908 103954,812 ERROR [STDERR]     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java662 103954,812 INFO  [STDOUT] FULL SPOOL codepre

Negative 5868 pI have a fairly basic website, written in pure php, no framework was used, running in a basic LAMP environment.p  pThe site dynamically generates markup based on the HTTP User Agent header, and some query string parameters. For example itemdetail.php would inspect the querystring param itemid and the User Agent header and produce some markup.p  pI want to cache this markup, so that the next time a device with the same User Agent and itemid in the query string tries to request the page, it simply dumps out whatever markup is in its cache.p  pI realise I could do this manually in php using memcache, and just write some code at the top of the page to inspect the relevant params, and either try serve from memcached or render the page and store the markup in memcached, but I was thinking it might be possible to avoid the PHP layer altogether, using something like what is described here a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2caching.html relnofollowhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2caching.htmlap  pSo, my question, which I realise might be vague and this post will get killed isp  pWhat is the recommended caching implementation here Is it indeed to use memcache at the php level, or are the apache modules sufficient to meet my needsp

Negative 5868 pI am trying to use the Type 1 Computer Modern Roman CMR fonts with LibHaru but I am unable to display the characters from 0 to 31, even if the font is loaded successfully since I can display the ASCII characters in the resulting PDF file. p  pWith GDI and Cairo, I have no problem displaying even a  character with a value of 0 null character, which corresponds to the Gamma character in most CMR fonts. In fact, Cairos strongcairoshowtextstrong function can display a string containing only a null character. The function knows that the null character corresponds to a valid character instead of assuming that its a null terminator.p  pBecause strongcairoshowtextstrong requires a nullterminated string, if the string contains a null character, it can only display 1 character. GDIs strongTextOutstrong, however, is more flexible since it has a emlenem parameter indicating the length of the string.p  pWith LibHaru, strongHPDFShowTextstrong and the like, the string must always be null terminated, so I have to modify the source code to accept a string containing only a null character. Unfortunately, the library does not display even the characters in the range 1 to 31.p  pAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

and how to call function from controller so that output is shown on HTMLpage as well.I think I am not specifying hub URL where it should write and thats why its not calling client side function when i send it directly from controller class instead of calling hub function from client side because in client side chat URL is specified  and I think thats why when i call send function from client page client add message is executed.I am unable to find a way to specify address for hubp  pWhen I press send button on screen ,This logging message is shown SignalR Triggering client hub event addMessage

Negative 5868 pI have listbox in my XAML, few checkbox and filter button. My application generates loads of logs which I display in the listbox. When I have data in the listbox, what this XAML will do is user will checkuncheck checkbox. Based on that the data in the listbox will be filtered when button is clicked. Depending on data i want to show different forecolor and background color on each item.p  precodeprivate void FilterButtonClick  object sender , RoutedEventArgs e      Whenever filter button is clicked, i will check for checkbox status. whichever checkbox  is ON I will add checkbox name into Dictionary. Then I will read string from Listbox and extract particular keyword from that and match with Dictionary key. If it matches then I will modify the background and foreground color for that particualr listbox items. My problem here is only certain Listbox items get updated rest of them are unchaged. When debugged i found that itemcontainergenerator returns null for all other items.      for  int i  0  i lt ListBox1.Items.Count  i            ListBoxItem item1   ListBoxItem ListBox1.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndexi          string recordType         string []  contentArray          if  item1  null              continue         if  item1.Content                continue          contentArray  item1.Content.ToString.Split new char []  , , StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries          recordType  contentArray [ 1 ]          if  checkBoxType.ContainsKey  recordType                              int code  RecordTypeToColorCode [ recordType ]                 item1.Foreground  ColorCodeToForeColor [ code ]                     item1.Foreground  Brushes.DarkCyan                     item1.FontSize  13                     item1.Background  Brushes.LightGoldenrodYellow                       else                              item1.Foreground  Brushes.LightGray                    codepre  pThe issue I am seeing is that if suppose my listbox has 1000 items then only 3540 items are updated. Rest all items are same. I debugged more into the code and I found that after some number 3540 all items are coming as null which i why i am not able to update all items in the listbox.  I have not turned on Virtualization in my code. Is there any way I can update all the items. Any help is appreciated. I am thinking if there is any issue with ItemCOntainerGenerator, as it only displays certain items, also Virtualization is turned off. I am newbie to WPF so please bare with me if its silly question.p
Negative 5868 pLets think about an orchestration. The main activities takes place within a scope shape with 2 associated Catch Exception shapes 1 for System.Exception and 1 General Exception. This orchestration makes use of a helper C class library and the BizTalk scopecatch catches exceptions that are thrown within the library, as well as unhandled exceptions that occur within them.p  pThe issue that Im wondering about that Im able to create is this Say a version of the helper library gets published and suddenly there is a method missing that was previously there and the orchestration tries to call it. Inevitably a codeMissingMethodExceptioncode is thrown, which seems to happen as soon as the Scope shape is reached.p  pThe codeMissingMethodExceptioncode is not caught by the orchestration and therefore the message is suspended. I realize that with proper testing this should never happen, but Im just trying to cover all the bases should they happen and really just out of curiosity. p  pIs there a way to catch these exceptions, or since it seems to happen at a level before the scope is calledp

Negative 5868 h1Vectors and Linked Listsh1  pVectors are stored in memory serially, and therefore any element may be accessed using the codeoperator[]code, just as in an array.p  pA linked list contains elements which may not be stored continuously in memory, and therefore a random element must be accessed by following pointers, using an iterator.p  pYou probably already knew this.p  h1Advantage of Priority Queh1  pRecently I discovered the priority queue, which works kind of like a stack, but elements are codepushcodeed into the container, and this function places them in an order according to comparisons made with the codeoperatorltcode, I believe.p  pThis suits me perfectly, as I am testing for events and placing them in the queue according to the time remaining until they occur. The queue automatically sorts them for me as I codepushcode and codepopcode elements. Popping does not affect the order. I can write an codeoperatorltcode so this isnt a problem.p  h1Issues I have not been able to resolveh1  pThere are three things which I need to be able to do with this event queuep  p1 Search the event queue for an item. I assume this can be done with an algorithm in the standard library For example, find If not I can implement one myself, provided I can do point 2. See belowp  p2 Iterate over the queue. I think the default underlying container is codestdvectorcode... Is there a way to access random elements within the underlying vector What if I choose to use codestddequecode instead I need to do this to modify certain event parameters. Events are placed in the queue. As an example, I may need to process an event and then subtract a constant amount of time from each remaining events timetoevent parameter. I suspect this cannot be done due to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4422933randomaccesspriorityqueuequestiona.p  p3 Remove an element from the queue. Sometimes when processing events, other events become invalidated, and therefore need to be removed.p  pCan points 13 be done All the information I have on codestdpriorityqueuecode has come from a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencequeuepriorityqueue relnofollowcplusplus.coma, and so my default answer would be no, there is no way to do any of these things. If I cant do all three things, then I guess I will have to write my own Priority Queue wrapper. Oh boringp

Negative 5868 pHaving recently started programming for android, i have run into a part of my code i wonder if can be designed in a better way. I have a codeSparseArraycode containing mapping of Ints representing resourceIds to an abstract class called codeResourcecode. My question arises when i want to retrieve my resource as multiple classes inherit from this class.

Also, below are screenshots showing what happensp  pAt the beginning img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhCaP7.jpg altenter image description herep  pAfter making the window smaller img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUbOUq.jpg altenter image description herep  pAfter making the window wide again img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfplPm.jpg altenter image description herep  pI found that if set the height of select elements outside of the media query, it works the commented out part of the fiddle. However, Im very wary of setting the height in the default case, as different browsers will end up with too much white space in the dropdown or it cut off part of the text.p  pIs there a better way to do this Or is explicitly setting the height outside the media query the only way to make this work for IE9p  pstrongNOTEstrong Changing the Browser Mode in IE10 does not reproduce this. It only happens in the actual IE9 browser.p

The address is stored in an address table, and there can be many addresses to each client record.p  pSo I initially thought to do a view that put together the main client record with the various addresses. This resulted in duplicate rows because of the join.p  pNext, I wrote a query that rolls up these child tables and concatenates them together. This makes it easy to search against and doesnt end up with any duplicates. I put it into a view, but its pretty slow. Im preferring to keep it a view because of the nature of the component that is accessing the data, however, Im not completely opposed to it.p  pCan this be sped up or am I going about this the wrong wayp  pHeres the SQL TSQL, actuallyp  precodeWITH ClientBase AS      SELECT DISTINCT Client.ClientID, ClientNames.FirstName, ClientNames.LastName, ClientNames.MiddleName,          AddressHistory.Address1     AddressHistory.Address2 AS StreetAddress,          AddressHistory.City, ContactInfo.Contact AS Phone     FROM Client         INNER JOIN ClientNames ON ClientNames.ClientID  Client.ClientID         INNER JOIN AddressHistory ON AddressHistory.ClientID  Client.ClientID         INNER JOIN ContactInfo ON ContactInfo.ClientID  Client.ClientID  SELECT DISTINCT vcs.ClientID, vcs.FirstName, vcs.LastName, vcs.MiddleName,                 SELECT STUFF SELECT DISTINCT TOP 100 PERCENT   ClientBase.StreetAddress AS [text]                                 FROM ClientBase                                 WHERE ClientBase.ClientID  vcs.ClientID                                 FOR XML PATH, 1, 1,  AS StreetAddress AS StreetAddress,                 SELECT STUFF SELECT DISTINCT TOP 100 PERCENT   ClientBase.City AS [text]                                 FROM ClientBase                                 WHERE ClientBase.ClientID  vcs.ClientID                                 FOR XML PATH, 1, 1,  AS City AS City,                 SELECT STUFF SELECT DISTINCT TOP 100 PERCENT   ClientBase.Phone AS [text]                                 FROM ClientBase                                 WHERE ClientBase.ClientID  vcs.ClientID                                 FOR XML PATH, 1, 1,  AS Phone AS Phone FROM ClientBase AS vcs codepre

However, the main problem I am facing is that my application uses emdynamicem MongoDB collections. So I do not have a domain class for each and every collection.

Therefore, the answer Im looking for lies into the followingp  h2How to modify the result of getBounds to be used for fitBounds without zoom effect afterwardsh2  pBasically, Im quite sure this can be calculated because thats what the map does, but in the opposite direction, when adding margins, to show the given bounds completely. In these terms, tell me how to calculate the margins and therefore, how to calculate the correct input for codefitBoundscode having output from codegetBoundscode and your answer will be accepted.p  pThanks in advancep  h2Updateh2  pZoom and Center retrieval and setting does not work for me heres the reason whyp  pI am going to hold the maps viewport information in the database. Later on, I want to recreate the map and show the exact same location again. However, the mapping platform can differ from user to user. Therefore, zoom and center is not standard between different mapping platformsframeworks and cannot be used in all them with the same results. Therefore, the only standard way is to hold the bounds in the database. So the question needs an answer exactly in the direction it is asking for.p

Negative 5868 pHi this is more of a style question. I have a small script that works with a socket, and I have constants i know they are not real constants, but heyy, at least they are in capital that declare some properties,p  pre  Port address for the serial port to read the weight from PADDR  devttyUSB0  socket address uri, backlog, and buffer SADDR  localhost28000 BACKLG  0 BUFF  1024  for cross platform compatibility use epoch in unix time EPOCHSTART  datetime1970, 1, 1 pre  pI however might add functionality to change these by parsing arguments. So the question is, should I just change these directly when parsing argumentsp  por should I be nice and use the above constants as defaults and change the options which I would then pass around to functions who need them This seems a bit too much, but then again, I dont want to write code that will be frowned upon p
Negative 5868 pGood day, I am specifically trying to perform a search through my storedprocedures with the aim of finding a procedure that does not contain a cetain word. Example nolock. p  pI understand and i successfully achieved this with a query like below.p  precode   Select Name as [Procedurees with no nolock] from  database.sys.procedure WHERE OBJECTDEFINITIONOBJECTID  NOT LIKE myKeyword . codepre  pThe above successfully returned the names of procedures without the keyword in them. However, the stored procedures script are mostly long and may require the use of the keyword more than one time in a single procedure. Example may be after each FROM TABLE name i need a key word with nolock . I want the search to be perform till the end of the procedure and where exist a TABLE NAME, a mykeyword must follow else return the procedure name among those with no mykeyword. p  pSince i have like twelve table names i want to use, i thought i could use CASE like p  precode     Select Name as [Procedurees with no nolock] from database.sys.procedure  WHERE OBJECTDEFINITIONOBJECTID NOT LIKE Mytable NAME , then plus the keyword.  codepre  pThis does not look ok for me because i have quite few tables names and it also possible that the table name may appear numerous time in the procedure and may be have the keyword for the first time only. Please is there anyway i can achieve this  Also sorry for my inability to explain clearly. Any help would be appreciatedp

Negative 5868 pIs there a name for a application structure or design pattern for a multilayer UIp  pFor exemple, lets say I have a web application using multiple layers of codeltdivgtcodep  pLayer0  background image,p  pLayer1  Left button lt,p  pLayer2  Center button ,p  pLayer3  Right button p  pAll layers are the same size but they have different transparencies.p  pLayer0 would be 100 in size and all black, Layer1 would be 100 in size but transparent with a lt arrow pointing left on one third of the screen, Layer2 would be the same as Layer1 but with an  dot in the middle third of the screen Layer3 would have the same as layer1 but arrow point right .p  pAnd by interacting with the screen, the client would change the layers order with, lets say javascript, the layers would change position to bring up certain element or even hide some by bringing them down.p  pSo layers order could be 1, 3, 0, 2 or it could even have more layer with static content inside them so the order could be 0, 5, 6, 1, 3, 25, 36, 19, 10, 8, 9... etc.p  pSo is there a name for those application or design pattern or application structurep  pAnd is this bad practice Ok, this is probably a matter of likes or dislikes so lets change this forp  pIs there a best case scenario where this would theoretically work best, or is there a case where this is not a good ideap  pThanksp

Negative 5868 pI am creating a website for a local company and I am splitting off the header for each page into a individual php page which I then include into each page. I was wondering what would be the best practice to insert individual description and title content into the php header for each individual page. Should I create a php variable before the included header.php link and then insert that variable argument into the title and description tags in the php file Each variable would have different titles and description depending on what page its on. Or would it make more sense to someone include these different description and title content into another external php page If you have a even more correcteasier way that would also work best with SEO please let me know.

Negative 5868 pI hope this will make sense since I cant use a JS fiddle because it doesnt support C Models at least not that I can tell. Basically I am trying to clone a product in one div to another div when that product is selected.p  pHere is the html and cp  precodelt     var i  0      foreach var product in Model.Products      gt          ltli classlrowitem idproductlti gt gt          ltdivgt              Contains styling like photos, product titles, etc. I dont think youll need this information, its super long.         ltdivgt          ltligt lt         i      gt codepre  pMy scriptp  precodeproduct1.onclick, function       var offercart  product1.clone     offergrid.appendoffercart  codepre  pSo as you can see, I turned all the lis so they have IDs such as product 1. Now if I click product 1 or actually its two but you all know that it will clone product one to the other div. However, there are over over 50 products. So I know instead of copying and pasting this code over and over there has to be an easier way. p  pIm a beginner so Im sorry if the answer is obvious. I was proud of myself for getting this far without help Backend friend did the C stuff, I just do the jQuery and JS If someone could tell me where to begin, a hint or give me an example in JS Fiddle as a guide Id be so grateful. Im really enjoying learning JavaScript and hope to be able to contribute to this awesome community one day p  pAlso if this has already been answered by someone else please link me and Ill delete this asap.

Negative 5868 pOk, so I have customized ApplicationUser, I need to load up a collection when the user logs in, and Im just trying to find the best way to do that.  Ive looked at the examples on the web, but those only customize the ApplicationUser by adding custom properties not Collections.  I need to load up an IListlt when the user logs in.  I see a couple of ways to do this, and Im wondering which would be considered the best way I know this is somewhat subjective, but I think this is somewhat new ground.p  pAnyway, in the Login method on the AcccountController we have thisp  precode    public async TaskltActionResultgt LoginLoginViewModel model, string returnUrl             var user  await UserManager.FindAsyncmodel.UserName, model.Password             if user  null                               await SignInAsyncuser, model.RememberMe                          else                              ModelState.AddModelError, Invalid username or password.                                 If we got this far, something failed, redisplay form         return Viewmodel      codepre  pI could add a line after the codeawait SigninAsynccode to load my collection, but that seems wasteful, as the UserManager is already going to the database.  What I really want is some way to tell the user manager to code.Includecode my collection when it queries the database for the user.  What Im looking at is inheriting from the codeUserStoreltApplicationUsergtcode and overriding the codeFindByNameAsynccode function that is called by the codeUserManagercodep  precode   public virtual TaskltTUsergt FindByNameAsyncstring userName              this.ThrowIfDisposed         IQueryableltTUsergt entitySet               from u in this.userStore.EntitySet             where u.UserName.ToUpper  userName.ToUpper             select u         return Task.FromResultltTUsergtentitySet.FirstOrDefaultltTUsergt      codepre  pand override it for the customized ApplicationUser that Im using and load up my properties.  Is this the way this should be done, or am I overlooking something in codeAspNet.Identitycode somewhere that would handle this more simplyp  hr  pSo that blew up in my face quickly, it would seem you arent going to inherit from codeUserStoreltTUsergtcode and get access to emanythingem that you might actually want to use when overriding one of these methods, as its all codeinternalcode or codeprivatecode.  So short of copying and pasting all of codeUserStoreltTUsergtcode and reworking the one method I want are there any suggestionsp

Negative 5868 pBlinnphong shading...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF1vxE.png altNormals img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combbTRM.png altBlinnphongp  pSo the issue Im having, as the above image hopefully illustrates, is that I cant seem to get my specular highlights to shade smoothly. The problem is the abrupt cutoff along face edges, which shouldnt be happening. The diffuse lighting appears to be working quite well, and it uses the same interpolated values. Heres the code for the blinnphong specular highlightsp  precodevec3 halfAngle  normalizelightDirection.xyz  viewRay  float blinnTerm  dotnormal.xyz, halfAngle blinnTerm  clampblinnTerm, 0.0f, 1.0f blinnTerm  powblinnTerm, 300.0f  float specIntensity  intensity  blinnTerm  vec4 specColour  specIntensity  specColour codepre  pcodelightDirectioncode is constant, its infinitely far away ie. the sun. As for viewRay, its computed in the vertex shader like so, using the projection matrixp  precodeviewRay  vec3UV.x  2.0f  1.0f  projection[0].x,                UV.y  2.0f  1.0f  projection[1].y,                      1.0f codepre  pIm using deferred rendering, which is where the UV values come from rendering to a full screen texture.p  pThe only thing I can think of is that the normal interpolation just isnt smooth enough. But if thats the case, how would I go about fixing it Im storing the normals as 16bit floats, but upping it to 32 bits didnt make a difference.p
Negative 5868 pIm tracking the time users spend reading contents on my website. To consider the user is actually reading, I do a first ajax request after 10 seconds the page has been loaded. Then, I set the codebeforeunloadcode event to trigger another ajax request to notice the user has finished reading.p  pThere is a problem when the user opens another page in a different tab, but the page Im tracking is not closed, so I set I timer after 10 min to trigger the end reading ajax and unset the codebeforeunloadcode. This makes browsers to send the signal when the page is open, but the tab hasnt been closed.p  pHowever, Ive noticed that on mobile devices Android, iPhone and iPad, the timer set to automatically notice finish reading after 10 min doesnt get executed. So, Im wondering if strongdo mobile devices stop executing javascript when the page is not shown on the screen to save batterystrong If so, how could I run the timer and trigger the ajax request even though the page is not shown but still openp  precodefunction endReadingid    .ajax     url  url endreadcontent ,     type post,     data id id,     async false,     setTimeoutfunction    .ajax     url  url newreadcontent ,     type post,     data contentslug  content.slug ,     success functiondata        window.onbeforeunload, function endReadingdata       setTimeoutfunction          endReadingdata         window.offbeforeunload       , 600000         , 10000 codepre
Negative 5868 pI have to build a compiler for a subset of C. Obviously since this is my first time doing such thing its not going very well. However. Im currently trying to build a lexer and parser for said subset.p  pI decided to build it up piece by piece and fix errors as they come along. So I have a basic grammar as shown below. This grammar parses correctly and I can do simple math, including the comparison operators. Since thsi is a subset of C, and they return integer values, this is possible.p  pNow comes the tricky part. I also want need to model in codecode and codecode as strongunarystrong operators, meaning 5  5 should equal 0.p  pSince these two unary operators bind the tightest, I figure I need to put them in the term clause of my grammar. So I changed my term clause to the followingp  precodeterm           NUMBER                NOT term  printfNOT termn   2                 SUB term  printfMINUS termn    2                LEFTPAR exp RIGHTPAR  printfexpression between parentsn  2                               codepre  pHowever, this makes bison complain about shiftreduce errors. I know the basics of how to going about fixing these, however, this spawns shiftreduce errors in almost every possible state so Im a bit confused at the moment. p  pI could add more precedence in my grammar by chosing codecode over codecode but these are equally tight. p  pstrongEntire grammarstrongp  precodecalclist      nothing               COMMENT  printfCommentn               calclist comp EOL  printf dn, 2                 comp           exp                comp GREATER exp  printfcomp GREATER factorn  1 gt 3                 comp LESS exp  printfcomp LESS factorn  1 lt 3                 comp EQUAL exp  printfcomp EQUAL factorn  1  3                 comp NEQUAL exp  printfcomp NEQUAL factorn  1  3                exp            factor                exp ADD factor  printfexp add factorn  1  3                 exp SUB factor  printfexp sub factorn  1  3                factor         term                       factor MUL term  printffactor mul termn  1  3                 factor DIV term  printffactor div termn  1  3                           term           NUMBER                NOT term  printfNOT termn   2                 SUB term  printfMINUS termn    2                LEFTPAR exp RIGHTPAR  printfexpression between parentsn  2                               codepre  pThe output of Bison is the followingp  precodebison dv bison.y bison.y conflicts 12 shiftreduce flex lex.l cc o calc bison.tab.c lex.yy.c lfl codepre  pIm not going to paste the entire bison.output file here as this is quite a lenghty file.p  pEditp  pThe grammar pasted below did not contain the codeSUBcode token.

Negative 5868 pOk let me explain what does not work perfectly means.p  pI have a listview without the codeandroidstackFromBottomtruecode parameter. I also have an ArrayAdapter with the regular codegetItempositioncode. I call my webserver, get the data on an asc date order.p  pThis way the item in position 0 top of the list has the smallest date. And I can scroll topbottom. Good.p  pI added codeandroidstackFromBottomcode and now I see that now you can start scolling from bottomtop but the item in position 0 is still the top item and has the smallest date. So the adapter has not changed its order.p  pThe only way to solve this is to change codegetItemgetCount1positioncode inside the adapter. However I add and notify the adapter and the adapter will still add the items to the bottom.p  pI guess that the structure is codeListView gt Adapter gt Row Viewscode so no matter the codestackFromBottomcode value, there is only one child, the adapter. Rightp  pAnyhow, how can have a ListView with Adapter in reverse orderp

Negative 5868 pIm learning JavaScript and got to the section in my book that described creating new DOM elements like tables, rows, and columns, so I wanted to create a table similar to the periodic table of elements that I could later go back to and fiddle with as I learned new things.

Except that it doesnt display anything, and there is nothing showing up in the console in FireFox v29.0.  p  pIdeally, I wanted to create 7 rows periods and 18 columns groups, and then display the elements that were associated at those locations in the table, and then try formatting it for example, there are empty cells inserted between elements 1 and 18, since the only elements in that period are Hydrogen 1 and Helium 2.  An example of this can be seen here a hrefhttpwww.webelements.com relnofollowhttpwww.webelements.comap  pHowever, my first task creating a basic table just doesnt seem to work, and either Im using the wrong terminology or no one has posted about this before and javascript periodic table links mostly to just things like a hrefhttpwww.webelements.com relnofollowhttpwww.webelements.coma.

Negative 5868 pIm new to noSQL technologies, and I was surprised there is no transaction support whatsoever. My main problem is when i make some of our insert task, that insert consist of 5 seperate insert. We have to find a document by 4 different IDs. The problem is that the document is fairly large, and its really expensive to store it like thisp  ul lipkey    valuep  hrli lipuser1   HugeDoc1pli liuser2   HugeDoc1li liuser3   HugeDoc1li ul  pSo we come up with an internal Id, that points to the document. Yes, I know this design somewhat violates the whole noSQL concept, but it saves a lot of memory. If document insert fails, the Ids have no meaning, and should be removed.  Is it a good idea to write my own rollback handling, keep track of successful insertsupdates Or the whole concept is wrongp

Negative 5868 pSo, Im using pdcurses to add some color to my console application, but Im having issues.  If I make a second window and try to color its output, it works just fine, but if I try to color output to stdscr, nothing happens.p  pI want to keep using stdscr rather than cover it with another window, because stdscr will receive output that I send to stdout normally, allowing me to use a C style interface to the console.  By sending output to cout, it goes to stdscr, and thats currently the only way I know of to use a C interface to pdcurses.  In addition, other libraries will occasionally send their output straight to stdout, and if I use stdscr that output wont be lost I know of luas codeprintcode function off the top of my heard.p  pHeres some sample codep  precode This prints a red gt in the inputLine window properly.  wattroninputLine, ABOLD  COLORPAIRCOLORRED wprintwinputLine, ngt  wattroffinputLine, ABOLD  COLORPAIRCOLORRED   This prints a light grey Le Testing. to stdscr.

Negative 5868 pSo, I am just diving into simple web animations for a game, and I am looking for advice. Eventually, Ill get a good grip on beziers and arcs and learn how to animate along a path to get some nice Diablo IIIesque curving numbers but, for now, I am just trying to get the fundamentals down.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netrLcwax9k4 relnofollowFirst real attemptap  pThe key code is pretty simplep  precodepaper.text170, 95, dmgValue.attrfillwhite, fontsize16.animate     transformt0,50, fillopacity0 ,500.node.setAttributeclass, noselect codepre  pA CSS styling prevents the text from being highlighted thanks to a user here for the help. The main issue, is that the text is still there with no opacity you can hover over it and see the text cursor. Although it works, it kind of messy looking. Also, since there is no variable assigned, I dont think I can dispose of it with Element.removep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netrLcwax9k7 relnofollowWhere I am at nowap  pThere were a lot of small revisions I made inbetween saved versions that made the code to the bulkiness that it is now. I wanted the ability to limit the number of numbers flying around at once for slower computers, so I put them into an array that can be looped endlessly and used, although that probably isnt needed and it wouldnt be a big deal to leave it out.p  pAlso moved from using transform, to setting the ycoords, and placing the .hide into a separate function for the callback which, for some reason worked instead of placing it at the end of the animation.p  pThis version appears to work at first, but the animations get interrupted when you click too many times and Im not sure why. I am sure I can figure it out in the end with enough time, but I might be making this too complicated, anyway.

Negative 5868 pstrongHow does SQL Server handle logins when there is an ambiguity, for instance, logins exist for both the Windows User account and for a AD group that contains this user strong p  pWeve had a little issue with permissions in SQL Server 2008 with Windows users from our Active Directory and groups from that AD. Ill try to explain with an example.p  pImagine a Windows Domain User codeDOMAINmyUsercode that belongs to an AD group codeDOMAINSomeGroupcode.p  pIn SQL Server, I have 2 databases codeSomeAppDbcode and codePublicDbcode. p  pThe goal is that all users that are members of codeDOMAINSomeGroupcode should be able to access codePublicDbcode, but only codeDOMAINmyUsercode should be able to access codeSomeAppDbcode.p  pInitially, in SQL Server a Windows login codeDOMAINSomeGroupcode mapped to the AD group was created on the instance, and a User was created in the database codePublicDbcode with proper role membership, and that worked well, users from group codeSomeGroupcode could access the data they needed in codePublicDbcode. p  pFor the needs of a new application, we wanted to give explicit access for db SomeAppDb to user codeDOMAINmyUsercode, while still allowing access to codePublicDbcode. We therefore created in SQL Server a Windows login for codeDOMAINmyUsercode, and a User was created in the database codeSomeAppDbcode, with a mapping between the 2. p  pFrom that moment, myUser could access codeSomeAppDbcode as expected, but could not longer access codePublicDbcode, and we had an error like p  precodeCannot open database PublicDb requested by the login. The login failed. Login failed for user DOMAINmyUser codepre  pMy intuition tells me that when the user accesses the SQL Server instance, SQL Server sees a login the matches the Windows user and ignores the login existing for a group that the user belongs to.p  pOne approach is to explicitely add access on the db PublicDb for user myUser, but I would rather avoid that solution as it forces to update PublicDb everytime we want to give access to new users which is exactly what we were trying to avoid initially ... we did that as a temporary fix, hoping to find a better option.p  pstrongHas anybody else encountered this issue  is there a better approach strong p  pthanks in advancep

Negative 5868 pI am using an embedded board. The problem is Wifi Module is on the same Usb bus as my usb pheripheral. The bus is HighSpeed and when performing certain task the USB high speed bus simply drops and wifi stops working. My question is can you use Python to setup an interrupt so that if wifi goes down the python script automatically comes into play and does codeifdowncode and then codeifupcode and finally if that does not help then reboot. I know how to do these function but thats assuming wifi module is working correctly. I have no idea how to setup an interrupt.p  pEdit I have tested the system for Kernel panic.  That is simply not the case here. The problem is for some unknown reason USB bus is failing to communicate with modules. I dont have a DPI so cant go into serial debug. But it is just a guess that USB bus fails and connection drops.p

But what decides how many executors are started  how many nodes from the cluster are used e.g. the total cluster memory and the cores that get takenp  pOn another similar note is there a way to change the memory asked for on a per job or task levelp

Negative 5868 pI am trying to find a way of compiling the code in VBA on workbook open. I can do this manually by opening the VBA environment, going into Debug and Compile VBAProject but was wondering if there is a way to do this through the code every time the workbook opens. p  pThe purpose of this is to load the code into the computers memory to prevent a compile error due to use of some Active X Objects. As mentioned, I can do this manually and it solves the problem however, as there are many users that use this and the workbook is password protected, not all will have access to the debug option.p

However, the moment I try loading my own simple cube mesh, the program notifies me that Our simple parser cannot handle the .obj file.

It is worth noting however, the .obj code of the objects I export appear in a single line without any line breaks. strongThis is the obj code of a simple cube mesh I exportedstrongp  precode Blender v2.73 sub 0 OBJ File ROOM.blend  www.blender.org mtllib room.mtl o CubeCube.004 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 vn 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 vn 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 vn 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 vn 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 vn 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 vn 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 usemtl None s off f 61 21 11 f 72 32 22 f 83 43 33 f 54 14 44 f 25 35 45 f 76 66 56 f 51 61 11 f 62 72 22 f 73 83 33 f 84 54 44 f 15 25 45 f 86 76 56 codepre  pstrongThe .obj code of the cube provided in the tutorial in comparison is as followsstrongp  precode Blender3D v249 OBJ File untitled.blend  www.blender3d.org mtllib cube.mtl v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 0.999999 1.000000 1.000001 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 vt 0.748573 0.750412 vt 0.749279 0.501284 vt 0.999110 0.501077 vt 0.999455 0.750380 vt 0.250471 0.500702 vt 0.249682 0.749677 vt 0.001085 0.750380 vt 0.001517 0.499994 vt 0.499422 0.500239 vt 0.500149 0.750166 vt 0.748355 0.998230 vt 0.500193 0.998728 vt 0.498993 0.250415 vt 0.748953 0.250920 vn 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 vn 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 vn 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 vn 0.000001 0.000000 1.000000 vn 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 vn 1.000000 0.000000 0.000001 vn 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 vn 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 usemtl Materialray.png s off f 511 121 431 f 511 431 841 f 352 762 872 f 352 872 482 f 293 6103 353 f 6104 764 354 f 125 515 295 f 516 6106 296 f 517 8117 6107 f 8117 7127 6107 f 128 298 3138 f 128 3138 4148 codepre  pstrongOn debugging the crashed program, the following exception occursstrongp  blockquote   pUnhandled exception at 0x00007FF76255E2D5 in tutorial09AssImp.exe   0xC0000005 Access violation reading location 0x0000000000000000.p blockquote  pstrongThe call stack is as followsstrongp  blockquote   blockquote     ptutorial09AssImp.exeaiVector3taiVector3tconst aiVector3t amp o Line 67 C        tutorial09AssImp.exeloadAssImpconst char  path,     stdvector  amp indices,     stdvector,stdallocatorp          blockquote       pamp vertices, stdvector,stdallocator       amp uvs, stdvector,stdallocator       amp normals Line 149   C     tutorial09AssImp.exemain Line 92    Cp     blockquote   blockquote blockquote  pstrongMoreover, the exception occurs in vector3.h which looks as sostrongp  precode  Open Asset Import Library assimp   Copyright c 20062012, assimp team  All rights reserved.

Negative 5868 pI am trying to set up an ActiveMQ broker within the context of a web app hosted in Tomcat. Additionally, the connector that I want to use is TCP as eventually this broker should be accessible from remote applications.p  pSo far, what I have done is to create a simple web app with a local JNDI codecontext.xmlcode configuration like the followingp  precodeltResource authContainer     namejmsConnectionFactory     typeorg.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory     descriptionJMSConnection     factoryorg.apache.activemq.jndi.JNDIReferenceFactory     brokerURLtcplocalhost61616     brokerNameMQBrokergt  ltResource authContainer     namejmsMQueue     typeorg.apache.activemq.command.ActiveMQQueue     descriptionJMS queue     factoryorg.apache.activemq.jndi.JNDIReferenceFactory     physicalNameSOME.QUEUEgt codepre  pI have updated the codeweb.xmlcode file accordingly and called the connection factory from a codeServletContextListenercode implementing class as followsp  precodeInitialContext context  new InitialContext Context cntx  Context context.lookupjavacompenv ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory  ActiveMQConnectionFactory cntx.lookupjmsConnectionFactory factory.createQueueConnection codepre  pWhen deploying the app, I get an exceptionp  blockquote   pCould not connect to broker URL tcplocalhost61616. Reason java.net.ConnectException Connection refusedp blockquote  pI think this is because there is no configuration for the broker itself, as in online examples I see that files with Spring configuration are attached to the codebrokerUrlcode attribute of the resource. The issue is that the project environment is strictly defined, so I cannot use spring to provide the configuration. I have also seen some solutions with Camel, but that is also out of the question.p  pSo to sum up, the questions arep  ol liIs it possible to set up an ActiveMQ broker local to a web app, that can be accessed over the network by remote applicationsli liIs explicit configuration needed for the brokerli liIf yes, can this be done without using Spring for the broker configuration, but rather with a properties file or something similar that does not add dependencies to the projectli ol

Negative 5868 pWhen performing an archive build with strip debug symbols during copy set to YES, I get the warning skipping copy phase strip, binary is code signed.  The generally suggested solution on threads regarding this issue is to set strip debug symbols during copy to NO.  Sure that gets rid of the warning, but I dont think the approach to remove the low oil warning light will solve the underlying issue.p  pIt seems the size of the binary can get bloated when this option is set to NO. And also why would you want to ship debug symbols with your app  p  pI would appreciate tips, insights and optimally a solution.p

Negative 5868 pIn my Windows Forms application, I have a child form which is launched as a modal by my main form.

I would like the buttons codeDialogResultcode to be codeDialogResult.Nonecode if this happens.p  pUnfortunately, the setting does not seem to persist. To maintain a responsive UI, the longrunning task runs in a separate codeTaskcode, and then the UI updating after the task has finished is done in a codeContinueWithcode block afterward, which in turn uses codeInvokecode to do the UI work.

However, when I hit submit to store the information to the database I get an error saying codeNo Genre matches the given querycode The other posts on SO that regard this error dont seem to be from the same context. I think that it might be something to do with selecting a name but storing an id for the genres, but otherwise Im at a loss.p

I followed the instructions in codeSection 59.4 Packaging executable jar and war filescode and then those in the codeSection 74.1 Create a deployable war filecode. According to the posts of a few other members of this site who were facing the same problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24741816deployspringboottotomcatherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27256904howdoideployspringbootwartotomcatherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28623468springbootwardeploymenttotomcatwithstatusokbutgives404onaccessherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25884010gradlespringbootprojectnotworkingintomcatasawarherea, just to name a few, I should be able now to create a create a WAR and deploy it on my Tomcat. Unfortunately, this is not the case.p  pThe project contains the following 3 Java files codeApplication.javacode, codeGreeting.javacode and codeGreetingController.javacode. The first is as followsp  precodepackage hello  import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder import org.springframework.boot.context.web.SpringBootServletInitializer import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration  Configuration EnableAutoConfiguration SpringBootApplication public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer       public static void mainString[] args          SpringApplication.runApplication.class, args           Override     protected SpringApplicationBuilder configureSpringApplicationBuilder application          return application.sourcesApplication.class        codepre  pThe second file contains the followingp  precodepackage hello  public class Greeting       private final long id      private final String content      public Greetinglong id, String content          this.id  id         this.content  content           public long getId          return id           public String getContent          return content        codepre  pAnd, finally, the latter file isp  precodepackage hello  import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController  RestController public class GreetingController       private static final String template  Hello, s      private final AtomicLong counter  new AtomicLong      RequestMappinghello     public Greeting greetingRequestParamvaluename, defaultValueWorld String name          return new Greetingcounter.incrementAndGet, String.formattemplate, name       codepre  pThe project also contains the following build.gradle filep  precodebuildscript      repositories          mavenCentral          dependencies          classpathorg.springframework.bootspringbootgradleplugin1.2.4.RELEASE        apply plugin war apply plugin java apply plugin idea apply plugin springboot  sourceCompatibility  1.8 targetCompatibility  1.8  war      baseName  rest     version   0.1.0   repositories      mavenLocal     mavenCentral   configurations      providedRuntime   dependencies      compileorg.springframework.bootspringbootstarterweb     providedRuntimeorg.springframework.bootspringbootstartertomcat     testCompilejunitjunit  codepre  pNow, if I run the task gradle war, I generate a WAR file of about 8 Mb. I can successfully deploy it to my local Tomcat, but when I point my browser to a hrefhttplocalhost8080resthellonameWorld relnofollowhttplocalhost8080resthellonameWorlda I got a blank page rather than the page with the expected JSON. If I run the task gradle build or gradle bootRepackage, I get both a JAR and a WAR and their original versions. Im mentioning these commands because I havent seen them anywhere and they might be useful to know. The original versions are both around 8 Mb in size, while the JAR and the WAR of 12 Mb. If I deploy both WARs, I get no error messages but, again, no results in the browser. Somebody here suggested that the web.xml could be missing, and in fact no WAR actually contained such a file. I am saying so because my Tomcat is not very recent and for some reason I thought Spring Boot had to automatically create a codeweb.xmlcode out of the code and annotations above.p  pAs suggested by dunni in the comments, here are my Tomcat log files.

Initially i am storing the accelerometer data in an arraylist namely sensordata. Then with the retrieved accelerometer data i perform some simple math calculation and the result will be stored in accelsum arraylist. With the results in accelsum i would like to perform low pass filtering and store it in lowpassvals arraylist and accordingly i have implemented the low pass filtering method. p  pstrongNow the question is when i print the arraylist namely lowpassvals values the output is an emptylist.strong  Can someone help me with this. thanks.p  pstrongBelow is the codestrongp  precode    Implemented to do some action upon sensor changed     Override     public void onSensorChangedSensorEvent event           if event.sensor.getType  Sensor.TYPEGYROSCOPE                gyrox  event.values[0]             gyroy  event.values[1]             gyroz  event.values[2]            else if event.sensor.getType  Sensor.TYPEACCELEROMETER               double x  event.values[0]             double y  event.values[1]             double z  event.values[2]             long timestamp  System.currentTimeMillis             AccelData data  new AccelDatatimestamp, x, y, z             sensorData  new ArrayList             sensorData.adddatasensordata arraylist contains the x,y,z values of accelerometer              forint k0kltsensorData.sizek                 accelsum.addfloat data.sumx, y, zaccelsum arraylist contains the power of x,y and z accelerometer values                 for int i  0 i lt accelsum.size i                      System.out.printlnsum   accelsum.geti                                    for int i  0 accelsum.size gt 10 i                      lowPassVals  lowPassaccelsum, lowPassVals                                   forint i0ilt10i                     System.out.printlnlowpassvals  lowPassVals                                           protected ListltFloatgt lowPassListltFloatgt input, ListltFloatgt output           for int i  0 i lt input.size i              if output.isEmpty                  return input                          output.seti, output.geti  ALPHA  input.geti  output.geti                    return output      codepre  pstrongThis is the acceldata class that handles the accelerometer data.strongp  precodepublic class AccelData      private long timestamp     private double x     private double y     private double z        public AccelDataSensorEvent event          this.timestamp  timestamp         this.x  x         this.y  y         this.z  z          this.xevent.values[0]         this.yevent.values[1]         this.zevent.values[2]         this.timestampevent.timestamp            public AccelDatalong timestamp, double x, double y, double z          this.timestamp  timestamp         this.x  x         this.y  y         this.z  z            public long getTimestamp          return timestamp           public void setTimestamplong timestamp          this.timestamp  timestamp           public double getX          return x           public void setXdouble x          this.x  x           public double getY          return y           public void setYdouble y          this.y  y           public double getZ          return z           public void setZdouble z          this.z  z           public double sumdouble x,double y,double z         double accxMath.powx,2         double accyMath.powy,2         double acczMath.powz,2         double accsum  accxaccyaccz         return accsum            public String toString           return ttimestamp, xx, yy, zz                  codepre

Negative 5868 pIm trying to make an imageview rotate around its Y axis, similar to a card flipping, but it should have the same picture on both sides.p  pTo do this, I use an ObjectAnimator in an AnimationSet though this happens when the Y rotation is the only animation in the set, as well as when its combined with other animations to rotate it from 0 to 180 around Y axis. This works fine the first time. However, if I click it again, the image will suddenly get mirrored then rotate 180 degrees around Y axis.p  pHow come the image gets mirroredreversed before animating My current idea is that it retains some property, so while it first goes from 0 to 180, next time it will jump from 180 to 0, then rotate from 0 to 180 again. Im not sure if that is the cause, however if it is, how can I work around this and prevent it from happeningp  pThanksp

My view controller observes these properties, zips them together and applies the changes at once. however somehow my fetching code is being called twice, which causes the indexPaths to be calculated and observed more than once, which causes inconsistencies with the codetableViewcode and causes crashes.

Negative 5868 pIm using Rotativa to print MVC views as PDF files. However, SVG will not print unless the SVG is first converted to an image and then rendered via an image tag. I want to do this successfully in C but I dont want to save the files, so what I would like to do in one controller action is to take the raw SVG which I already have and save to a temporary file that can be referenced in the views img tag. There are all sorts of tools out there and one was perfect but written in Perl and I am unable to convert to C. Ultimately, just trying to take SVG code and create a file that can be referenced in an image tag. Any ideasp
Negative 5868 pI want to create a notification system such as the one here at SO. I read about strongWebsocketsstrong and strongLong Pollingstrong. My current Website has some AJAX features already but follows the http request pattern, so each site is a new http request. p  pWhen using a strongSingle Page Applicationstrong every user would start a long polling request which would run on the server. My concern is that if I start long polling on a certain page and the user changes the site makes a new http request polling starts again and I will end up with several running processes on the server per user, since the process from the last page wont stop running. This would be lots of wasted resources.p  pI am using PHP server side and have the feeling I will run into performance issues real quick when I do it like this. Am I correct Do I have to choose another approach or build a SPA to create such a featurep

All of the print statements are in there for debugging purposes only and wont be seen by the user in the final product. p  pAdditional info that might be useful  The server DOES receive the data, as the print statement saying file data received is printed. Additionally both the client and server print a bunch of garbage characters most of which cant be read by ascii and are replaced by a diamond with a question mark. This is not what youd expect when reading binary, since I open the file in the client in binary read mode, youd expect 0s and 1s.p  pThanks in advance for the helpp

Negative 5868 pIm using yadcf plugin on jquery dataTables.  Im looking at  yadcfshowcase.appspot.comserversidesource.html  and say you click on the first column filter.  It shows you a list of options.  You click on Other Browsers Eng.  It transforms the table appropriately.  You click on the filter again to see the same list of options.p  pFor me, when I transform the table through AJAX, I also transform the filters, which is a good thing.  I mean you now see what else is available to you... unless you click on your original filter, then you have to erase that filter to go back to see your original list of options.p  pHow do I keep the original list of options in therep

I have no idea what is going on.p  pIve tried this using codepicbox.Image code to the element on the codeListltBitmapgtcode or using codepicbox.ImageLocation code to its file path, but neither has been successful. The code that should make this happen is shown belowp  precode    public void saveLatestImages              specific path for My Pictures only         string testImagesPath  Environment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData  Test Images         if there is a Pictures folder         if Directory.ExiststestImagesPath                         get number of files in folder             int fileCount  Directory.GetFilestestImagesPath.Count              more than one file in folder             if fileCount gt 0                                 create data structures to store file info                 filePaths holds path of each file represented as a string                 string[] filePaths  Directory.GetFilesEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData  Test Images                  for each file in Pictures...                 for int index  0 index lt fileCount index                                      get name of image at current index                     imageName  filePaths[index]                     separate the part relating to the patient name everything before DDMMYYYY                     string subSpecifier  imageName.Split.Last                     subSpecifier  subSpecifier.Split[0]                     add to root directory to form subfolder name                     subDirectory  Path.CombinerootDirectory, subSpecifier                      subdirectory name formulated, check for preexisting                     subfolder does not exist                     ifDirectory.ExistssubDirectory                                              create it                         Directory.CreateDirectorysubDirectory                                          otherwise, file will be added to existing directory                      take everything from end and folderfile division to get unique filename                     string fileName  imageName.Split.Last                     add this to the existing subDirectory                     fileName  Path.CombinesubDirectory, fileName                      copy the image into the subfolder using this unique filename                     File.CopyimageName, fileName, true true gives instruction to overwrite any existing file with the same path                      add full filename to list of bitmap images                     images.Addnew BitmapfileName                      update the shortcut to the file in the image storage shortcut folder                     shortcutDirectory  getShortcutsubSpecifier, fileName                                                   public void displayLatestImages              there are images in list         if images.Count gt 0                      picbox defaults to first image             picboxImage.ImageLocation  Path.GetFileNameimages.First.ToString                   check for images before or after current image to enable buttons         checkFirstLast      codepre  pThis shows everything that saves the images to their new file location, and should then allow the first image added to the List to be displayed.p  pAny advice on how to correct this would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks, Markp
Negative 5868 pIve just started with Protractor and was going through some of the general documentation of selenium. And I read that Selenium webdriver doesnt need a server unlike Selenium RC. So if thatd the case why would Protractor need a server. Isnt it built on top of WebdriverJS  And what role is the server playing here p

Negative 5868 pI have a piece of LINQ code that results in Stack Overflow Exception and I cant figure why. I will keep the code as is since I cant tell which part is the cause.p  pConsider we have a list of booking recordsp  precodeClass BookRecords     Public STARTDATE As String     Public ENDDATE As String     Public BOOKNUM As String End Class codepre  pAnd the task is to find out all records which 1Start time is within 15 minutes from now amp 2Is consecutive to records in 1.p  pHeres how I do itp  precodePrivate Function ValidRecRecordList As ListOf BookRecords As ListOf BookRecords     Dim timeNow  Date.Now     Valid records by itself     Dim validRecords  RecordList.Where         Functionr             Dim startDate As DateTime             VVVVV stack overflow thrown at this return             Return DateTime.TryParser.STARTDATE, startDate AndAlso                    startDate  timeNow.TotalMinutes lt 15         End Function      Do         consecutive records         Dim conseRecords  RecordList.ExceptvalidRecords.Where                             Functionr validRecords.Any                             Functionvr vr.ENDDATE.Equalsr.STARTDATE          If Not conseRecords.Any Then Exit Do         validRecords  validRecords.ConcatconseRecords.ExceptvalidRecords     Loop      validRecords  validRecords.OrderByFunctionvr vr.STARTDATE                                 .ThenByFunctionvr vr.BOOKNUM      stack overflow after the ToList line      Return validRecords.ToList End Function codepre  pThe code works fine until after the last line validRecords.ToList. And then stack overflow occurs at the Return DateTime.TryParse ... statement. Size of RecordList and validRecords are small both 2 in testing and therere no other threads modifying these ListsObjects. p  pWhy is this using up the stack I know the LINQ statements are probably badly structured and creating lots of listsIEnumerables unnecessarily but is that the cause that would be genuine stack overflow then, coolp  pI figured making validRecords a list instead of IEnumerable would avoid the problem but Id appreciate if someone could point out the real cause.p
