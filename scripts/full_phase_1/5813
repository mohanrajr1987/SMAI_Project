Positive 5813 pMy ultimate goal is to be able to pipe together command line processes that deal with files without touching the disk.  Is this possible  I cant use stdinstdout because some of the processes I need to run only take files sometimes more than one as inputs.  I have been successful in doing this using FIFOs and Popen with small files within Python but not with larger files on the MB scale.  Here is a snippet of code that Im using to test this functionality.p  precodefifo1  os.getcwdfifo1.nii fifo2  os.getcwdfifo2.nii  command  diff fifo1 fifo2  os.mkfifofifo1 os.mkfifofifo2  with open1brain.nii, rb, 0 as r     s1  r.read with openrun1.nii, rb, 0 as r     s2  r.read  def writefifo, s     with openfifo, wb, 0 as f         f.writes  writer1  Threadtargetwrite, args[fifo1, s1] writer1.start  writer2  Threadtargetwrite, args[fifo2, s2] writer2.start  proc  Popenshlex.splitcommand, stdoutPIPE  try     while proc.poll  None         continue     print proc.communicate[0] except     if proc.poll  None         proc.kill     os.unlinkfifo1     os.unlinkfifo2     raise  os.unlinkfifo1 os.unlinkfifo2 codepre  pThis works with small text files, but when I run it on large binary files, I get a broken pipe error on my writing threads, so it seems like the read end the diff process is closing before the write finishes.  I have gotten filereading processes to read stdin by using a symlink to the stdin file descriptor, but I cant use stdin since I sometimes need multiple inputs.  Is there a way to get FIFOs to work, or is it possible to create my own file descriptors that work like stdin to send data into processes  Please let me know if any of this is unclear Thanks.p

Positive 5813 pI am trying to receive data from a child process over an anonymous pipe in Windows.  I know how to do this using standard IO streams but these are being used for other purposes.  I also know how to do this in Linux or OSX using codeforkcode, codepipecode and codeexecvcode.p  pIn Windows, you can create a pipe with codeCreatePipecode and make one end emnotem inheritable with codeSetHandleInformationcode.  Then for stdout and stderr you can pass codeSTARTUPINFOcode, with codehStdOutputcode or codehStdErrorcode set, to codeCreateProcesscode to pass the other end to the child.  After the call to codeCreateProcesscode the parent most close its handle to the childs end of the pipe.  This is all explained in detail in a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68249928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowCreating a Child Process with Redirected Input and Outputa on MSDN.

Positive 5813 pIm doing the CodeCademy course Learn the Command Line.

Like thisp  precodecat volcanoes.txt  wc  cat gt islands.txt codepre  pWhy do I have to pipe the output of codewccode to codecatcode when you can just redirect the output of codewccode to codeislands.txtcode without piping it to codecatcode first.

Positive 5813 pI am having trouble implementing my pipe. It reads Unix terminal commands from a text file for commands such as lswc where it opens a pipe so that the output of ls can be used for wc.p  pI have implemented it to parse program names ls, wc and store them in two separate arrays arguments and arguments2, fork a child process, then have that child fork another child process, then the second child process calls the execvp command and passes the first program to be executed.p  pThe output from ls is then written to the pipe by changing the standard output. The former child process then execvps the other process wc and reads from the pipe by changing the standard input.p  pHowever, wc loops indefinitely and does not seem to count the number of words from ls. Ls executes in a directory where there are words to be counted.p  pAny tips Thank you so much and sorry for the long explanation. p  pHere is a simpler example It forks, creates a pipe, and implements ls and writes its output to the pipe, goes back to the parent and reads from the pipe the output of ls. It still seems to be reading forever or not working right.p  precode   main.cpp   PipeTest    Created by Dillon Sheffield on 92815.   Copyright  2015 Dillon Sheffield.

Positive 5813 pIm new to piping and have been trying to create a pair of pipes which allow a child process to write to the parent process, and the parent process to communicate back.

When I read in the child programs stdin, it will receive what I wrote from the parent.p  pstrongThe aimstrongp  pTo create a card game where the parent talks to each individual client the child processes and gives all the moves and information to them, from its stdout to the childrens stdin. The individual child processes give back their moves on their stdout, read by the main parent. The moves that the game makes is fully decided by a sequence, not players. So its a bot game.p  pstrongWhat I am stuck withstrongp  pIm not sure how to get it so the parent can read the childs stdout through a file stream.

Positive 5813 pIm trying to write a Pascal LazarusFPC program that is started by another program as a process. The caller the Arena chess GUI talks to my program using StdIn and StdOut.p  pFirst I used READLN in my program to get the text commands sent from the GUI and WRITELN to reply to them. That worked well except that my program would stop doing anything if the READLN had to wait for input from the GUI. Since I wanted the program to carry on working and only deal with commands as they arrived I had to change this.p  pSo I changed the code to usep  precode... var   inpStream         TInputPipeStream ... inpStream  TInputPipeStream.CreateStdInputHandle ... if inpStream.NumBytesAvailable gt 0 then begin     SetLengthsbuffer, inpStream.NumBytesAvailable     inpStream.Readsbuffer[1], lengthsbuffer end ... codepre  pThat worked really well as it no longer paused for the read. But then the WRITELN stopped working nothing gets sent back to the GUI. I thought maybe this would helpp  precode... var inpStream         TInputPipeStream     outStream         TOutputPipeStream ... inpStream  TInputPipeStream.CreateStdInputHandle outStream  TOutputPipeStream.CreateStdOutputHandle ... if inpStream.NumBytesAvailable gt 0 then begin     SetLengthsbuffer, inpStream.NumBytesAvailable     inpStream.Readsbuffer[1], lengthsbuffer end ... outStream.Writesbuffer, lengthsbuffer codepre  pBut that makes it worse as now it doesnt read or write anything. So how can I have nonblocked input on StdIn while maintaining the ability to write to StdOutp
Positive 5813 pI have a C app running on 64 bit Linux. I am planning to pass a simple struct data without virtual function in it from one thread to another thread  in same process via pipe WITHOUT any special consideration of alignment. Basically, the sending side sends the amount of sizeofstruct bytes. And recving side cast those bytes to struct.  There is no concurrent accessatomicity concern. And there wont be any plan to pass the data to a different process or remote machine in the future.  p  pI am positive that the code will work as expected. p  pHowever, I like to get opinions from experts of SO on my approach to see if there is any potential issues.  as testing might not disclose them in this case.p

Negative 5813 pMy company has to crunch a lot of data and part of the process involves running the solver and plotting a graph through resulting data points. Obviously there is a lot of copy and paste involved and the whole process is shaky, error prone and all round clusterfudge.

Negative 5813 pIn the last couple of days, Ive been trying to get a solution to an activerecord issue that has been plaguing me.  Posts on a hrefhttprailsforum.comviewtopic.phppid94513p94513 relnofollowrailsforuma and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions754167rubywindowsactiverecordandcontrolcstackoverflowa have turned up completely dry.  The length and level of detail in those posts may have dissuaded commentors, so Im trying again  in brief.p  pUnder windows, the trap behavior is normal in my scripts  until I require activerecord, at which point traps no longer function properly.  They fail to run at all and it is leaving my database in disarray.p  pThe script in question interacts with other scripts on other systems through active record.  When a user hits controlc or the script terminates for any other reason, it is critical that the script notify the database of its the scripts impending doom before it exits.  With trap out of commission, Im stuck.p  pIs there a workaround  If youre interested in test code, see my linked posts.  The problem can be reproduced in just a few lines.p  pThanks...p
Negative 5813 pIm looking to rewrite code that update a table on a Sybase IQ database v14 that does the followingp  ol liselects all the records in the table and extracts some data to fileli liupdates the extracted to file flag for each record in the tableli ol  pCurrently, once a record is written to file, its extraction flag is updated.  Currently there are 40 000 records in the table and the process uses 40GB of database temp space.  Each record in the table in question contains 60 fields and at most columns contains 120 characters.p  pIs the database server creating a new version of data for the table for each record in the table and as time goes, and so we create a snowball of temp data on the database server with accounts for the  40GB used  Would the best method to process the data to first extract the data, write it to file, then perform a bulk update.  Since it is my understanding that Sybase IQ is generally used in arena im thinking the database would be optimised for inserts and deletes and selects but performs badly on updates   Would the sybase database IQ server perform the same on HPUX and Windows server 2003.p

Whether I pass in an IP address, or a fully qualified host.domain... host name, the lookup name call will fail, saying it cannot find the hostname, where the hostname is just the basename of the host without its domain.

Negative 5813 pLets setup the question first. p  pWhat I have is 4 tables Customer, Address, Order, OrderItems. Each are mapped using Hibernate Annotations and accessed through a Spring DAOServices layer.p  pWhat I am trying to do is merge duplicate customers together. So all that really needs to happen is all orders and addresses associated with customer B, need to update their customerid foreign key to point to customer A. Then customer B must have its disabled bit set.p  pInstead of sending these simple queries to our database, hibernate goes crazy and issues a ton of select then update queries. Particularly it selects all order items attached to an order because this is defined codeEAGERcode, and this point is not changeable..

Does this mean I can use get16Bits0 with suitable warnings to future code maintainers Ive always assumed that JRE and compiler behavior are both machineindependent for arithmetic, but this case is testing my faith somewhat.p

Negative 5813 pIm learning how to develop on the iPhone, I bought a book called Beginning iPhone 3 development Exploring the SDK. After I bit I decided to ditch Interface Builder. I still design all my views in IB, but I write It all in code and only use the nib file to get the controls frames.p  pSo now I need to make a UIButton, and the documentation is different from the other controls. I tried using initWithFrame, and theres this other method buttonWithType which I assume is autoreleased, but anyway I couldnt get a button to appear on the screen. Could someone please write a bit of code that locally creates a button with a title I can change that I can then just add to my views subview and release so I can see how its donep

Negative 5813 pIm using Porter Stemmer to stem the words, and heres a problem Im running intop  pWord mortgage is correctly stemmed to mortgag Word mortgagee is arguably incorrectly stemmed to mortgagep  pThere are approximately 100 documents with the word mortgage There is 1 document with word mortgageep  pWhen I build an index without putting mortgagee in any documents, everything works fine  searching for mortgage or mortgages or mortgag returns all 100 documents. p  pWhen I build an index and one of the documents contains mortgagee, searching the index for mortgage only returns a single document with mortgagee which was stemmed down to mortgage.  However, searching for mortgag or mortgages returns all 100 documents.  p  pThe only logical conclusion I can make from this problem is lucene first searches for the prestemmed word, and if it doesnt find any results, it continues to search for the stemmed word.  Thus, when searching for mortgage, it first finds the mortgage that was stemmed from mortgagee and stops searching.  Is this the correct behavior, or is it a bug p

Negative 5813 pExperimenting using different approaches and reducing code maintenance I have ended up using reflection to create new forms in my MDI application.p  pThe reason for this solution is to provide a central place to setup new forms, implement security checks and possible future needs.p  pI currently have a static Activator class that is instantiated with the MDI parent form, and whenever I need to create setup new forms for the application i call a method i have created  codeprivate static T CreateFormltTgtparams args[] where T classcode. This method uses the System.Activator class to instantiate the given class. I have other static methods like codepublic static void ShowCustomerscode that in reality uses the reflection method by calling codeCreateFormltfrmCustomersgtcode which sets up the MDI parent and so on.p  pThe object creation occurs within a trycatch block and I show a message if the form couldnt be created and the reasons why.p  pWhat Ive explained so far does possibly not validate the need to use reflection to create MDI forms in a business application, but I wish to add another use this has in my application. I have a component that implements the ISupportInitialize interface, and when I drop this onto a form it performs security checks and throws a System.Security.SecurityException in the EndInit method. This exception is cought in the codeCreateFormcodemethod and a user friendly message is displayed to the user.p  pAlso, I was thinking of possibly storing a MRU most recently used list of the forms that are created and where better to do this than in the codeCreateFormcode method.p  pIm not familiar with terms like code smell, design smell or such but Ive seen the words used often enough, but my question basically boils down to thisp  pGiven the information ive provided hopefully understandable, does this approach smell badp  pIf so, which approach is better suitedp  pAny comments are welcome.p  pThanks, Stefanp  precodepublic class Activator      private static Activator instance      private MainForm mainForm      private ActivatorMainForm mainForm              this.mainForm  mainForm           private Activator                          private static Activator Instance              get                      if instance  null throw new ExceptionNot activated             else return instance                    private static void ShowMDIChildltTgtparams object[] args where T  class              try                      System.Windows.Forms.Form frm  CreateltTgtargs as System.Windows.Forms.Form             ShowMDIChildfrm                  catch Exception e                       Check if the inner exception is a security exception             bool isSecurity  false             if e.GetType.EqualstypeofSystem.Security.SecurityException isSecurity  true              if isSecurity ampamp e.InnerException  null ampamp e.InnerException.GetType.EqualstypeofSystem.Security.SecurityException isSecurity  true              ifisSecurity                 MessageBox.ShowInstance.mainForm, You do not have the neccessary privileges to access this resource, Access denied, System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxButtons.OK, System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxIcon.Stop             else                 MessageBox.ShowInstance.mainForm, e.Message, An error has occurred, System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxButtons.OK, System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxIcon.Error                    private static void ShowMDIChildSystem.Windows.Forms.Form form              Instance.mainForm.ShowMDIChildform           private static T CreateltTgtparams object[] args where T class              T result  System.Activator.CreateInstancetypeofT, args as T          return result           public static void RegisterMainForm mainForm              instance  new ActivatormainForm           public static void Customers              ShowMDIChildltForms.Customersgt       codepre

Negative 5813 pIm writing a custom DAL VB.NET for an ordering system project.  Id like to explain how it is coded now, and receive some alternate ideas to make coding against the DAL easiermore readable.  The DAL is part of an ntier not nlayer application, where each tier is in its own assemblyDLL.p  pThe DAL consists of several classes that have specific behavior.  For instance, there is an Order class that is responsible for retrieving and saving orders.  Most of the classes have only two methods, a Get and a Save, with multiple overloads for each.  These classes are marked as Friend and are only visible to the DAL which is in its own assembly.p  pIn most cases, the DAL returns what I will call a Data Object.  This object is a class that contains only data and validation, and is located in a common assembly that both the BLL and DAL can read.p  pTo provide public access to the DAL, I currently have a static module class that has many shared members.  A simplified version looks something like thisp  precodePublic Class DAL     Private Sub New     End Sub      Public Shared Function GetOrderOrderID as String as OrderData          Dim OrderGetter as New OrderClass         Return OrderGetter.GetOrderOrderID      End Function  End Class  Friend Class OrderClass     Friend Function GetOrderOrderID as string as OrderData     End Function End Class codepre  pThe BLL would call for an order like thisp  precodeDAL.GetOrder123456 codepre  pAs you can imagine, this gets cumbersome very quickly.  Im mainly interested in structuring access to the DAL so that Intellisense is very intuitive.  As it stands now, there are too many methodsfunctions in the DAL class with similar names.p  pOne idea I had is to break down the DAL into nested classesp  precodePublic Class DAL     Private Sub New     End Sub      Public Class Orders         Private Sub New         End Sub          Public Shared Function GetOrderID as string as OrderData         End Function      End Class  End Class codepre  pSo the BLL would call like thisp  precodeDAL.Orders.Get12345 codepre  pThis cleans it up a bit, but it leaves a lot of classes that only have references to other classes, which I dont like for some reason.p  pWithout resorting to passing DB specific instructions like where clauses from BLL to DAL, what is the best or most common practice for providing a single point of access for the DALp

The Boards UnitTest doesnt actually need a mock and just checks that when I run SetAllCellsToColor color it will really turn them that color.

Negative 5813 pI am using Djangos presave signal to implement autonowadd. There is a lot of discussion on the internet on why you should or shouldnt implement it yourself. I do not appreciate comments on this. Neither on whether I should be rewriting the save function I have a lot of models that use autonowadd so using signals makes sense.p  pMy question isbr I would like to check if the instance is created or updated. According to some sources on the internet this can be done by testing if codekwargs[created]code is True. However codecreatedcode does not appear in my codekwargscode even though the instance is newly created. I was just wondering if it has ever existed or that it has disappeared magically. I know I could also test if codekwargs[instance].idcode is set this in fact works for me, but Id like to know if kwargs[created] still exists.p

Negative 5813 pI am attempting to write a twopass algorithm incorporating some legacy code. I want to move through a particular container twice, once in order and once in reverse order. Obviously, my first thought was to use an codeiteratorcode and a codereverseiteratorcode, but strangely the designers of the container class Im using did not see fit to define a working codereverseiteratorcode for the container codereverseiteratorscode here cannot be dereferenced like codeiteratorscode can be. I already have an algorithm that requires a codereverseiteratorcode.p  pMy thought is to use the first pass iterator for the first part of the algorithm, and as I perform the algorithm codepushfrontcode the items into a new container, then iterate through the new container. This will take up memory, which isnt critical in my application, but made me wonder are there any cleaner alternatives to codereverseiteratorscode in C, or should I take the time to rework my algorithm using only forward codeiteratorscodep

To clear things up  Im implementing an ObservableCollection with a context sync. It means that when i adddeleteupdate an item on the collection, i correspondingly do the same on the ObjectContext. When i checked my exception, i saw that it is raised when invoking the ObjectContext.DeleteObject method, after the item was updated from the UI thread. So it basically got nothing to do with the ObservableCollection but with the ObjectContext itself. The exception though is identical to the exception i first got when trying to delete item on the collection from another thread the excecption is  emThis type of CollectionView does not support changes to its SourceCollection from a thread different from the Dispatcher threadem.p  pThe Plot Thickens....p  pMany Thanks...p

Negative 5813 pIn my main control Style in generic.xaml, Im trying to set the default value of a property of my main control and this property is of type Control, but this causes VS 2010 to crash when using MyMainControl in the design view.  The issue can be seen using the code below.  Im using Silverlight 4.  I also tried to specify MyControl as a resource as shown commented out in the code below, and this also caused VS 2010 to crash when using MyMainControl.p  pI found that if I remove DefaultStyleKey  typeofMyControl in the MyControl constructor, then the issue does not occur but then MyControls style is not applied to it and the control does not look right.p  pThe main goal here is that I need to allow the MyMainControl class to optionally create an instance of the MyControl class to set the MyControl property to during the instantiation of the MyMainControl class.  By default, I want the MyControl property to be set to an instance of MyControl, but I want the user to be able to specify null or specify an instance of MyControl with different settings for the MyControl property, in their XAML, and if they do so, I want the default internal instantiation of MyControl to not take place in order to improve the efficiency of MyMainControl.p  pI originally created the MyControl instance in the constructor of MyMainControl, but if the user sets the MyControl property to null in their MyMainControl XAML, the instance of MyControl is still needlessly created internally and then overwritten with null, which results in much poorer performance than just using null and not creating MyControl internally.p  pIn WPF, Im able to specify MyControl as a resource and then in the generic.xaml Style of MyMainControl Im able to set the MyControl property to an instance of the MyControl class, which has greatly improved the performance of MyMainControl if the user sets MyControl to null.  But I havent been able to get the same to work in Silverlight.p  pstrongIn summarystrong, the main idea is that if I can use the MyMainControl Style to specify a default value for the MyControl property, then the user will be able to specify their own MyMainControl Style in which they can specify for the MyControl property a value of null or an instance of MyControl with different settingsand since their MyMainControl Style will replace mine, then the default instantiation of MyControl that I specify in my MyMainControl Style will not occur.p  pI greatly appreciate any help anyone can provide on how this might be done in Silverlightp  precodeltResourceDictionary xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml xmlnslocalclrnamespaceMyNamespace gt  ltStyle TargetTypelocalMyControlgt     ltSetter PropertyOpacity Value1 gt ltStylegt  lt Note I tried specifying my control as a resource so I could in the MyMainControl style set the property to the MyControl StaticResource, but include this line of XAML causes VS 2010 to crash when using my main control. ltlocalMyControl xKeyMyControl gtgt  ltStyle TargetTypelocalMyMainControlgt     ltSetter PropertyMyControl gt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltlocalMyControl gt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt ltStylegt codepre  pp  pMyControl is a very simple class that derives from Controlp  precodepublic class MyControl  Control      public MyControl              DefaultStyleKey  typeofMyControl       codepre  pThe code for the MyMainControl MyControl DependencyProperty isp  precodepublic partial class MyMainControl  Control  ...     public static readonly DependencyProperty MyControlProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterMyControl, typeofMyControl, typeofMyMainControl, new PropertyMetadatanull      public MyControl MyControl              get                      return MyControlGetValueMyControlProperty                  set                      SetValueMyControlProperty, value                codepre

Negative 5813 pI am right now in the process of trying to figure out the best way of hashing the password for my ASP.NET MVC 3 application.  From what I hear, it is good to use the given password and a random salt and then store the hashed password and salt together.  My question is wont that make the random salt pointless  I mean the reason to hash a password is because if someone get into your database, they dont have the plain passwords and the salt make it much much harder to reverse the hash to get the password but but if I store the hash with the password, what is the point of the salt my knowledge on hashing is every limited so I could be completely off base with my thinking.p  pMy second question is what hashing method is the best one to use  I read that MD5 which is what I have always used is very simple to crack.  I hear the bcryptsha512 are pretty good.  Which one should use  I know that C by default comes with the sha512 hashing.  From what I can see, bcrypt is not included in the .NET library, are there any good libraries for C and bcryptp

Then there is a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsdockpanelsuite relnofollowDockPanelSuitea which I like but when Im using DevExpress it seems rather obvious that I would not use the a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsdockpanelsuite relnofollowDockPanelSuitea. When Im using DevExpress with codeUseWindowsXPThemecode option to true the menubar,toolbar seems to use the codeManagedRenderModecode which I dont want. I want to replicate the codeVisual Studio 2005code as closely as possible. Can anyone please guide me to some project which already uses this. Itll be very helpful. Also Im willing to use the MVP pattern for the development of this software.p

Negative 5813 pIm trying to debug the shaders in a SlimDX DirectX11 game Ive been coding for a while. The code runs fine and executes without a hitch albeit seemingly ignoring my textures and when I run an experiment to capture a single frame inside PIX it executes fine, however if I try to access either the Render or Mesh tabs in PIX for my captured frame I get the following errorp  precodeA call that previously succeeded failed during playback  EID 96 Call ID3D11DeviceContextIASetVertexBuffers HRESULT EFAIL codepre  pThe EID is one that occurs just before the frame Ive captured my frame starts at EID 108 so I cant see where its failing.p  pI decided to run a full stream of frames to see if that would show me the error.

Negative 5813 pI have this application that I am letting the user set up a search query based of values selected by them from a bunch of xml data that will then be used to search the database for stuff.p  pAt the moment I have 3 cells that can accept search parameters for the query, each cell loads its data onto the same uitableview so I have to do abit of fudging with my if statements to make sure everything works correctly for the correct dataset. p  pthe first cell allows the user to pick a motorbike manufacture, all of the manufactures are listed on the table view. the xml that is being loaded has a key value that is related to the second list which lists the model of every manfacture. I am wanting to set up the list of manufactures based of the manufacture selection as soon as the user selectes a tableviewcell.p  pso that when the user is back to the main view then selects the second cell the dictionary that i have created loads really fast.p  pAt the moment everything is done each time the subview is loaded.. so because my manufacture list is so big, when the user selects the manufacture they would like to search when the come back to the subview with the manufactre selected the id has to be compaired to every single model of every single manufacture to get the list to display which takes a very long time.p  pI would like to know how you would attempt something like this. below is a flow chart of how I am thinking to do it.

Both SDKs make use of a lot of common code which isnt part of the public interface of either SDK.p  pId like to structure the projects so that I have our common code in one static library framework which we keep private, and have each SDK is its own static library framework which wed publish.

Negative 5813 pI have an application that does some image processing on each new frame, recently I bought a new web cam that has really nice resoultion of 1280x960 compared to my old cam360x240, my application does some image processing on each new frame from web cam but with such a high resolution the processing just goes to slow and my app hangs.

Negative 5813 pAs an Actionscript programmer shifting to JSjQuery I often have to author multipage apps targeted mainly to iOS and Id like to know what is the best way to structure such apps.p  pMost of the time my apps are presentations, where each page has a different behavior i.e., some popups on page1, a group of sliders on page2, some drag and drop action on page3... you get the picture, and more often than not I have to keep track of several variables across different pages.p  pRight now I handle it like this I have a group of common functions in a script named codemyapp.jscode, while each page has its dedicated codepageX.jscode script to account for its specific duties. I store persistent values through the codestorage.jscode library and somehow manage to stick it all together and make it work.p  pHowever I recognize that there may be a vast area for improvement to this approach, so Id like to know how more seasoned developers deal with this situation.p  pThanks a lot,p  pGoblinp

Negative 5813 pI am trying to achieve the following behaviour for a PDF created with Adobe LiveCycle Designerp  pA table displaying data displays five lines per entry. The first three lines should stick to one another so they are all placed on the same page. This works fine by putting the pagination settings to Following Previous, Keep with Previous and Next.p  pNow the problem that I have been running into is that if the a table row is set to be kept with the previous line, the content of the table row does no longer allow for page breaks. So if I have longer texts in the last of the first three rows, all the rows will be put onto the next page rather than just having the page break within the content of the last row. If I allow the last of the three lines to detach itself from the previous row onto the next line, the page break looks fine but obviously is not what I want when the entire last row is put onto the next page and the first two remain where they are.p  pI have found this issue a few times on the web and there seems to be no solution to this. So the workaround seems to be the following emHave a line in between the second and third row which keeps the two together and hide it if I require a page break within the third row.emp  pThe concept works fine in terms of allowing for page breaks or not ... but I fail to implement a decent solution for strongdetermining whether I want to page breakstrong. I am believing that a good measure would be the vertical position of the first, second or third line. However I am not getting anywhere near this. I can read the strongrelativestrong yposition of the content of the line I want to pagebreak somewhat like thisp  precodevar node  xfa.resolveNodedata.listpage.tablData.area51[] xfa.host.messageBoxnode.linDescription.frmDescription.txtDescription.y codepre  pWhere area51 is a tablearea, linDescription is the table line with the descritption in it, txtDescription is the actual text. TablData is the table which is populated with the data. Documentation seems to hint that one way of getting the absolute position is to add the relative positions of the parents... but for some reason I cannot get the relative position of a table row, for example.p  pObviously I would much rather like to get the absolute position on the page, even better the space left to the bottom of the page.p  pWould anybody know a solution to this Maybe my assumption regarding the behaviour of page breaks and pagination also is not correct ... I am rather new to the LiveCycle designer.p  pThanks a lot for your helpp  pMichaelp
Negative 5813 pI have been struggling with a problem in the past few days. I really appreciate your helpp  pWhen I buildrun the sample ActionBarCompat with target API level 14. Everything works great.p  pThen I switched to target API level 8after all, this is meant to be used in old device with old api levels, it looks like without manually commenting out a lot of code that specifically invokes support API level 8 and upe.g. android.R.id.home, Build.VERSIONCODES.HONEYCOMB, the sample App wont build at all.p  pDoes that mean that an app must have multiple source code versions in order to run in different api levels Ideally, one set of source code can be used for devices of all API levels.p  pThanks in advancep  phumblelearnerp
Negative 5813 pAntescript Im aware that theres a prior SO question whose title sounds like it refers to the exact same question. It doesnt.p  pAnyway, this question is a little weird  there are plenty of better ways to work around the issues here, but Im curious as to how I could solve my particular dilemma.p  pLets say I have a method that uses emvarargsem to accept an arbitrary number of elements, perhaps of type codeIntegercode.  If I have an arbitrarylength array of Integers, is there a way for me to call my method with a commaseparated param list composed of each element of said arrayp  pHeres a brief, contrived examplep  precodeInteger[] paramList  new Integer 1, 2, 3 varMethodparamList[0], paramList[1], paramList[2]  varMethodfor param  paramList param  public void varMethodInteger...values      for Integer value  values          foovalue       codepre  pThat commentedout line hints at what I want to do. Since the codeparamListcode integer is arbitrary length, calling codevarMethodcode with each element explicitly requested line 2 wont work.  What Im wondering is if theres a way to dynamically generate the commaseparated param list from the elements of an array.p  pAgain, I realize that in an example like this, there are better ways to approach the entire problem, but please be aware that Ive simplified the code so that its only relevant to the particular issue were discussing here.  Any workarounds that address my posted code wont generalize to the problem Im really working on that led me to formulate this question in the first place.p

And as far as I know you can only jump to a section and not to a row with the index in tableview.p  pI dont want to add sections because then Ill have to add a section for each row, which would be kinda stupid.p  pSo my question is Is there any way to implement an index to a UITableView such that it when I tap on any part of the index it takes me to the relative row instead of section in the tableviewp  pI would probably endup writing a hack for this thing which a really wanna avoid and do it the way it should be done if there is any such way so any help would be greatly appreciated.

It does this by residing inside a nonscript element, so the stylesheet is only read if there is no javascript. p  pThis works for all desktoplaptop browsers I tested not tested on mac which I dont have access to. It works on Android with Firefox and Opera. I have cyanongenmod 7 only so no Google Chrome for me. p  pHowever when it comes to Dolphin and the default Android browsers, they read the css stylesheet that resides in the noscript section and pretty much the whole pagesite is not rendered in these browsers.p  pI have proven that this is what is happening by deleting the stylesheet link from the head section and the page renders correctly in those browsers. p  pIs there some way to get these browsers to respect the noscript tags in the head sectionp  pUPDATE This is using HTML5  noscript in the head is allowed a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRhtml5thenoscriptelement.htmlthenoscriptelement relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRhtml5thenoscriptelement.htmlthenoscriptelementap  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt         ltnoscriptgt             ltlink hreffacesContext.externalContext.requestContextPathcssnojavascript.css relstylesheet typetextcss gt             lt this link is being read even if javascript in enabled in dolphin gt         ltnoscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltnoscriptgt         stuff in this noscript element works correctly     ltnoscriptgt      ltdiv classnojavascriptdisapeargt          page full of stuff not being rendered because          dolphin browser is not respecting the noscript          tags in the head.      ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt   css in the noscript tag .nojavascriptdisapear displaynone codepre
Negative 5813 pIm working on an iOS application with Core Data that tracks scheduling of training courses and associated data. My model SIMCourse has two attributes  strongstartDatestrong and strongendDatestrong that are NSDate objects. So far, so good. p  pIm now working on adding a feature to prevent scheduling two courses during the same time. So, when I create a new SIMCourse, Id like to check whether its date range overlaps with any other existing SIMCourses date range. In other words, if my new course runs January 13, and I have an existing course that runs January 24, thats obviously a conflict.p  pI know I could fetch all the SIMCourse objects in my data store and iterate through them, but Im not at all confident this is the best way. Can anyone help point me in the right directionp

Negative 5813 pI know that this question belongs to the very early stages of the database theory, but I have not encountered such a problem since several months. If someone has a database with some tables associated together as chain with foreign keys and they want to delete a record from a table which has some dependent tables, what obstacles arise In particular, in a database with tables Person, Profile, Preference, Filter exist the associations as codePerson.idcode is foreign key in codeProfilecode and codeProfile.idcode is foreign key in codePreferencecode and codeFilter.idcode is foreign key in codePreferencecode, so as that all the associationscodeenter code herecode are codeOneToManycode. Is it possible to delete a Person with a simple queryp  precodeDelete from Person p where p.id 34 codepre  pIf no, how should look like the query in order to perform the delete successfully  If the database in the application is managed by hibernate, what constraints codeannotationscode should I apply to the associated fields of each entity, so as to be able with the above simple query to perform the delete       p

So now I have a clone of a remote repo, except the commit hashes are all different.p  pIs there any way to have the local repo still work with remote for pulling future commits from it It will never be pushing so that is not an issue. If I run git pull, it tries to pull its entire original history, which is unwanted and just recorrupts the local repo.p

When I execute a program that saves one curve and one rate and then execute a separate program that saves another curve with a rate then its all fine.p  pI use Python 2.7 and Django 1.4.p  pMODELSp  precodeclass InterestRatemodels.Model     type  models.CharFieldmaxlength20     term  modelFields.tgTimePeriodFieldmaxlength20     numTerms  models.IntegerField     mid  models.FloatField     curve  models.ForeignKeyInterestRateCurve      class Meta         uniquetogether  type, term, numTerms, curve      def unicodeself         return ssss  self.type, self.term, self.numTerms, self.curve      def strself         return sssss  self.type, self.term, self.numTerms, self.mid, self.curve   class InterestRateCurvemodels.Model     ccy  modelFields.tgCurrencyFieldmaxlength20     index  models.CharFieldmaxlength20     term  modelFields.tgTimePeriodFieldmaxlength20     numTerms  models.IntegerField     asOf  modelFields.tgDateField     cvid  models.CharFieldmaxlength20, blankTrue, default     rates needs to be explicitly maintained inside class for convenience     rates  []      class Meta         uniquetogether  ccy, index, term, numTerms, asOf, cvid      def unicodeself         return ssssss  self.ccy, self.index, self.term,                                        self.numTerms, self.asOf, self.cvid      def saveself         try             curve  InterestRateCurve.objects.getccyself.ccy, indexself.index,                                                   termself.term, numTermsself.numTerms,                                                   asOfself.asOf, cvidself.cvid             Delete all rates before saving the new rates             oldRates  curve.interestrateset.all             for oldRate in oldRates                 oldRate.delete             for rate in self.rates                 rate.curve  curve                 rate.save         except InterestRateCurve.DoesNotExist             superInterestRateCurve, self.save             curve  InterestRateCurve.objects.getccyself.ccy, indexself.index,                                                   termself.term, numTermsself.numTerms,                                                   asOfself.asOf, cvidself.cvid             for rate in self.rates                 rate.curve  curve                 rate.save      def addRateself, rate         rate.curve  self         exists  False         for r in self.rates             if r.type  rate.type                 if r.term  rate.term                     if r.numTerms  rate.numTerms                         exists  True                         continue         if exists  False             self.rates.appendrate codepre  pThe following code works finep  precode        date  tgDatemonth9,day12,year2011         curve  InterestRateCurveccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                    numTerms3, asOfself.asOf, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         curve.save         curve  InterestRateCurve.objects.getccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                                numTerms3, asOfdate, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         rate  InterestRatetermM, numTerms1, typeDeposit, mid0.01, curvecurve         curve.addRaterate         curve.save codepre  pThis execution results in one curve and one rate saved.p  pIn a seperate execution I runp  precode        date  tgDatemonth9,day13,year2011 DATE DIFFERS         curve  InterestRateCurveccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                     numTerms3, asOfdate, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         curve.save         curve  InterestRateCurve.objects.getccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                                numTerms3, asOfdate, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         rate  InterestRatetermM, numTerms1, typeDeposit, mid0.01         curve.addRaterate         curve.save codepre  pThis execution results in another curve and another rate saved.p  pHowever, the following execution does not work correctlyp  precode    def testSave2Curvesself         date  tgDatemonth9,day12,year2011         curve  InterestRateCurveccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                    numTerms3, asOfdate, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         curve.save         curve  InterestRateCurve.objects.getccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                                numTerms3, asOfdate, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         rate  InterestRatetermM, numTerms1, typeDeposit, mid0.01, curvecurve         curve.addRaterate         curve.save         date1  tgDatemonth9,day13,year2011         curve1  InterestRateCurveccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                     numTerms3, asOfdate1, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         curve1.save         curve1  InterestRateCurve.objects.getccyUSD, indexLIBOR, termM,                                                 numTerms3, asOfdate1, cvidTESTSAVE2CURVES         rate1  InterestRatetermM, numTerms1, typeDeposit, mid0.01         curve1.addRaterate1         curve1.save codepre  pThis results in two curves saved but only one rate saved.

Negative 5813 pMostly as a personal practice, im writing a framework for a personal website im working on. Currently Im trying to create a generic way to display forms on my website. Im using JSON models to model the form, which is transformed into HTML by PHP. What im currently trying to allow is something like thisp  precode[type] [contact address] [type] [contact address]  Add More codepre  pI know that with form element names like type[], the value of the various type fields is sent as an array to php. However, in this case, a codetypecode and a codecontact addresscode belong together. I know various ways to achieve this, like looping over the types, and then getting the related other fields, but somehow transforming it into an associative array seems much easier to use in the code.p  pNote, i know various ways to achieve this, but im trying to go for some best practices. Id prefer doing this in PHP, as im trying to minimize the amount of javascript on my website.p
Negative 5813 pIve had this seemingly simple problem nagging me for a good 10 years. OK, no every dayp  pIt works fine in IE but doesnt in FF and Chrome, which is usually an indication that something is wrong with the code... I want to have DIV boxes on both sides they are actually IMG of various sizes, so dont go on about using a table, with text aligned. Try this example at various window widths. In FF the 3rd line displays ABOVE the preceding DIV. WHY p  pBasically the idea is that the DIVs should stack along each side of the window, with the text in the middle. And if theres too much text, the next div simply gets pushed down. Works fine in IE.p  precodeltHTMLgt ltHEADgt ltTITLEgtAlign testltTITLEgt ltSTYLE TYPEtextcssgt   .DL  floatleft  clearleft  width10em height10em backgroundred   margin2 displayinline    .DR  floatright clearright width10em height10em backgroundgreen margin2 displayinline    .PL  textalignleft  backgroundF0E0E0     .PR  textalignright backgroundE0F0E0   ltSTYLEgt ltHEADgt ltBODYgt ltDIV CLASSDLgtltDIVgtltP CLASSPLgtThis is the 1st line.ltPgt ltDIV CLASSDRgtltDIVgtltP CLASSPRgtThis is the 2nd line.ltPgt ltDIV CLASSDLgtltDIVgtltP CLASSPLgtThis is the 3rd line which should align with the 2nd red square ltPgt ltDIV CLASSDRgtltDIVgtltP CLASSPRgtThis is the 4th line which should align with the 2nd green square.ltPgt  ltPgt No, I dont want a clearright in here.

The main function of the program calls a method codeopenInterfacecode of the class codepacketLoadercode implements codepacketRecievercode . the method codeopenInterfacecode opens the codeNICcode interface and starts capturing packets.  should i alter this method of codeopenInterfacecode to incorporate codemultithreadingcode at which point should i start making threads on the basis of what parameter should i make separate threads how should i implement the required codemultithreadingcodep  pcheersp  precodepublic void openInterfaceString filter, int numOfPackets     try          if devName.startsWithNICNAMEPREFIX                           ifnumOfPackets  1                 packetSamplingRatio  1             else                  packetSamplingRatio  numOfPacketsdoubletotalPcapFilePackets                                JpcapCaptor captor  null         if devName.startsWithNICNAMEPREFIX                          System.err.println.........inside openinterface             NetworkInterface[] devicesList  JpcapCaptor.getDeviceList                                          System.err.println.........inside openinterface 2              String nicName  devName.substringNICNAMEPREFIX.length             int nicID  1             for int i  0 i lt devicesList.length i                                   System.err.println.........inside openinterface 3                 if devicesList[i].name.equalsnicName                                         System.err.printlnDevice no  i   devicesList[i].name                                         System.err.printlncapturing on device   devicesList[i].name                     nicID  i                          if nicID gt 0                                  captor  JpcapCaptor.openDevicedevicesList[1],                         NICSNAPLEN, true, NICTIMEOUT                             System.err.println.........Device is open for packet capturing with                             System.err.printlnNICSNAPLEN    NICSNAPLEN   and NICTIMEOUT  NICTIMEOUT                                           else                  System.err.printlnNetwork interface   nicName                          cannot be found                 System.err.printlnAvailabel NICs                 forint k0 kltdevicesList.length k                      System.out.println   devicesList[k]                                  System.exit1                       else                          System.err.println.........inside else             captor  JpcapCaptor.openFiledevName                   if filter  null             captor.setFilterfilter, true                                          Start reading packets                     System.err.println.........filter checked                     PacketStorage ps  new PacketStorage          captor.loopPacketnumOfPackets, this                     captor.processPacketnumOfPackets, this                     forint j 0 jltnumOfPackets  j                     captor.getPacket                      System.err.println.........captured packet  j                                           System.err.println.........after capture.looppacket           catch IOException e          System.err.printlnException in openDevice   e         System.exit1       codepre

Negative 5813 pThis is my first ever question on stackoverflow so please go easy on me.p  pLet me give you little bit of backgroundp  pI have created an application that manipulates a bitmap within a viewthe image in this case being a map of a facility and I place points on the map using the actual x and y coordinates of the point on the bitmap. I track the offset of the top left corner of the bitmap relative to the top left corner of the screen by modifying this offset value based on the changes in the image placement made by gestures. This is actually working very well for panning and this allows me to easily convert a screen coordinate from a long press gesture into the actual coordinate on the bitmap. With this I draw a circle on the map and allow the user to create a point of interest that I push out to a database. p  pThe problem arises when dealing with zoom. I am zooming with a simplebr     codecanvas.scalescalefastor ,scalefactorcode  in the onDraw. With this zoom, the actaul scaling is relative to the top left corner of the image so the pinch to zoom is not intuitive since the actual location you are trying to zoom into runs offscreen very quickly. The scaling of the image in this manner however does not effect the actual offset of the image though so my point placement is still accurate. I use the following simple math to accomplish thisp  precodebitmapXCoordinate  event.getX  xOffset scaleFactor codepre  pI would like to use p  precodecanvas.scalescalefactor, scalefactor, gestureFocusX, gestureFocusY codepre  pin order to keep the zoom intuitive to users but this does a transform on the actual matrix of the bitmap so that my point placement is is no longer functional. It seems that the point on the bitmap is now somehow relative to the focal point of the scale and all the placed points are off and tend toward this focal point. I am aware that I need to take into account this transformation on the matrix in order to get my points placed correctly, but apparently, it takes a more intelligent individual than I. The solution is likely simple but I have been working on this for days trying to account for this new offset and I just cant get any real progress. Any insight into a solution for this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5813 pIm making this simple program in WPF not Windows Forms, its for an assignment at university. The program has two buttons and a listbox. When the program starts, the first button is enabled while the second one is disabled. When the user clicks the first button, a dialog box opens up that has an OK button on it. When the OK button is clicked, it gets all the file names from a directory and displays it on a listbox. But this is done using a background worker so the listbox adds the files gradually as the files are found. Now what I want to do is that AFTER the background worker has completed its work, that is, listed all the files in the directory, I want to make the second button enabled that was previously disabled. I know the syntax for making buttons enabled or disabled, you set true or false to .IsEnabled property. For example p  precode    this will disable the button     buttonName.IsEnabled  false  codepre  pBut what I want to know is how and where do I use this property what additional code do I need so that the second button becomes enabled only AFTER the background worker has fully completed its job. With my present code, what happens is that the second button becomes enabled as soon as the OK button is clicked and as as soon as the background worker starts. In the code below, btnSort is the name of the second button that should be enabled after the background worker is done. You could probably ignore the DirSearch method at the end, its just a method for getting files from a directory. I know there are other ways to search directories but I was told to use this method.p  precode    public partial class MainWindow  Window              BackgroundWorker backgroundWorker          string sourcePath            Listltstringgt list1  new Listltstringgt          public MainWindow                      InitializeComponent              backgroundWorker  new BackgroundWorker             backgroundWorker.WorkerReportsProgress  true             take this out if cancel not used             backgroundWorker.WorkerSupportsCancellation  true             backgroundWorker.DoWork                  new DoWorkEventHandlerbackgroundWorkerDoWork             backgroundWorker.ProgressChanged                  new ProgressChangedEventHandlerbackgroundWorkerProgressChanged                        private void ButtonClick1object sender, RoutedEventArgs e                      try                              System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog folderDialog  new System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog                 folderDialog.SelectedPath  Ctemp                 System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult result  folderDialog.ShowDialog                  if result.ToString  OK                                      if listBox1.Items.Count  0                                              listBox1.Items.Clear                                           if list1.Count  0                                              list1.Clear                                           sourcePath  folderDialog.SelectedPath                      backgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsyncsourcePath                      if btnSort.IsEnabled  false                                              btnSort.IsEnabled  true                                                                                catch Exception ex                              MessageBox.Showex.Message                                    private void backgroundWorkerDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e                      DirSearche.Argument.ToString             MessageBox.ShowComplete                   private void backgroundWorkerProgressChangedobject sender,         ProgressChangedEventArgs e                      FileFetchState state  FileFetchStatee.UserState             listBox1.Items.Addstate.FetchedFile                    public class FileFetchState                      public string FetchedFile                              get                 set                           public FileFetchStatestring fetchedFile                              FetchedFile  fetchedFile                                public void DirSearchstring sourcePath                      try                              foreach string f in Directory.GetFilessourcePath                                      string fileName  System.IO.Path.GetFileNamef                      if listBox1.Items.ContainsfileName                                              code for adding to list1                         list1.AddfileName                          backgroundWorker.ReportProgress0,                             new FileFetchStatefileName                          System.Threading.Thread.Sleep1                                                       foreach string d in Directory.GetDirectoriessourcePath                                      DirSearchd                                           catch Exception ex                              MessageBox.Showex.Message                            codepre

Negative 5813 pI am currently in the process of learning Java, and I have done what I could to try and understand what these two things mean and do, but I simply dont get it. I have done a lot of googling, and also checked around for past questions on the site, but I still dont get it. So far I know that this somehow refers to some kind of methodvariableobject, but I just dont get how it can refer to any of these, without in the examples I have seen actually specifing what to refer to, they just use the keyword this.something or this532, it does not make sense. Same story with toString, they is no logic in these two that I get. Anyways, can anyone explain these two keywords in a simple way to me, and tell me how they can be even remotely useful in any program. Thanks in advance.p

So even with 200 bytes for each of 3000 elements, the maximum memory 4GB should be enough.p  pThe other solution was to use deque instead of vector, but as I understand it perhaps wrongly, the deque is not that suitable for indexing and I really need to be able to access any element as fast as possible.p  pAlthough I will need to change the internal vectors, I think they are stored in struct as a pointer, which means that the whole vector of these struct elements should not need to reallocate memory after the internal vectors are changed again maybe Im wrong about this.p  pI am using CodeBlocks on windows.p  pDoes anyone have an idea, what causes this error and how can I fix it  I would like to keep vector as a container, but do not insist  Thanksp

Negative 5813 pI inherited a piece of code that reads in data from a UDP socket.  I need some help figuring out whats going on here and also if I can improve anything performance wide.p  pThe code starts by calling select, and then recvfrom.  Based on my research, it appears that recvfrom is only called when select returns the fact that there is data available.  This code basically consists of a thread that continuously listens for a multicast message.  As a result, it basically sits in the select routine until it either receives data or times out.p  pI was wondering if there was perhaps a better way to improve upon the performance of this code.  First, is select necessary  Based on this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16163260settingtimeoutforrecvfcnofaudpsocketsetting timeout for recv fcn of a UDP socketa it appears that I can just set the timeout of the recvfrom command itself.  Will this buy me anything  Also, based on some research, Ive seen alot of implementations without select.  Why is thisp  pAlso, ideally, Id like to free up as much CPU as possible.  Is there a way that I can put the process to sleep until it receives a packet  That being said, Id like to receive a full packet at a time for simplicity sake.p  pThanks in advance for the help.p
Negative 5813 pSorry if this has already been asked, but I wasnt sure of the correct wording, so I couldnt search it up.

Just putting it in with img tags adjusts the whole picture to fit the browser window, changing the height in the process.

This works in terms of allowing my app to respond to a URL like people123, but I cant figure out how to get the URL to jump from people to people123 and then back to people as the modal dialog box opens and closes.p  pObviously, I can just call location.pathpeople but the issue with that is that PeopleCtrl gets reexceuted and I want to avoid that since the state behind the modal should be preserved. p  pIn other words Im looking for a way to change the URLlocation without the normal routeProvider changes getting detected.p  pThanksp
Negative 5813 pI have a C project which has a extremely recursive function. This project when deployed and run on the dedicated machine it is eating upto 12 GB of memory. Previously, this process used to fail at 2GB limit. Hence, I converted this entire solution having 20 projects to 64 bit platform on visual studio 2010 platform. Now, it doesnt stop at 2 GB but eating up almost my whole RAM. Total RAM usage is 15.9 GB out of total 16 GB. I am using COM to run these application as dllhost. My questions arep  ol liHow to limit the memory being allocated fully causing failure of the processli liDoes windows frees the memory after recursion is over Because I am not seeing this process releasing memory until I kill this process.li liTerminating case is not the problem, I guess, beacuse my job is succeeded by using Expiration Time option in Recycling in Component Services.Or is there any other problemli ol

Negative 5813 pOk so Im trying to make a simple SQL CE Viewer application just to view my local databases for another application, I have it setup so that I can select what database I want to open and then it automatically populates a combo box with all of the tables in the database.  When I select a table it populates a DataGridView with the records in the table.p  pMy problem is switching between tables.  I cant seem to get the DataGridView to remove everything from the previous table and repopulate the DataGridView with the new table information.  Of course each table has different columns and rows and such.p  pIve googled and searched on here and every suggestion I find doesnt seem to work.  It populates the DataGridView with the first table just fine, but when I select another it basically adds the columns and rows into whatever was there....p  pHow can I get the DataGridView to completely clear for new datap  pAnd please dont tell me to use dataGridView1.DataSource  null  tried that, doesnt work.p

Negative 5813 pWe have a large Django application made up of a large number of different views some of which  contain forms. As with most large applications, we use a base layout template that contains the common layout elements across the applications mainly a header and a footer, which the templates for all of our views extend.p  pWhat we are looking to do is create a universal search box in our application, accessible on every page, which allows users to perform searches across the entire application, and want to place the search box inside the header, which involves placing a codeformcode inside our base layout template. This means that every view in our application will need to be able to handle the submission of this search form. Once this search form is submitted, we will need to redirect the user to another view containing the search results.p  pHowever, we are struggling to come up with a pattern to handle this. Does anyone know of functionality built into Django that will help us to build this Failing that, can anyone suggest a good strategy for modifying our application so that we can handle  this usecase without having to modify a large number of existing views which we dont have the resources to do at the momentp  pPlease note that the focus of this question is intended to be the best way to handle the submission of a form which appears in every view, and not strategies for implementing a universal search algorithm which we have already figured out.p  pstrongIdeas Explored So Farstrongp  ul liOur first idea was to create a base codeViewcode class that implements handling the universal search form submission, and have each of our views extend this. However, this is not possible because we already have views that inherit from a number of different Django view classes codeTemplateViewcode, codeListViewcode, codeFormViewcode and codeDeleteViewcode being some examples, and to be able to build our own common view class would mean either writing our own version of these Django view classes to inherit from our own view base class, or rewriting a large number of our views so they dont use the Django view classes.li liOur next idea was to implement a mixin that would handle the universal search form submission, in an attempt to add this functionality to all our views in a way that allows us to continue using the different Django view classes. However, this brought to light two new problems a how could we do this without modifying each of our views to become a form view, and b how can we do this in a way that allows the form handling logic to play nicely when mixed in to existing codeFormViewcodesli ul

Negative 5813 pI have just started using Go GoLang and I am finding it a great language. However, after many years of UML and the Object Oriented methods, I find that modelling Go programs Reverse engineering is a bit problematic, in that Go Structs contain propertiesstate, but no methods, and methodsfunctions that use Structs as parameters even the ones that do magic so that it makes a Struct look like an object, dont contain methods, or state.p  pDoes this mean I should be using another Methodology to model a Go Program or does UML sufficiently model the language constructsp  pYes I know that if you use methods on the Structs that the behavior of an object in UML can be mapped into Go via a combination of a Struct and a Struct Method, but I am finding this to be wrong, an impedance mismatch in paradigms of sorts.p  pIs it time for a new perish the thought diagramming technique, for the brave new world where behavior is no longer controlled by an object can behavior be modeled without reference to the state that it is affecting p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI am trying Data Flow Diagrams out, to see if they fit better to the paradigm. So far so good, but I think I am going to come unstuck when I model the Methods of a Struct, the compromise in the DFD being that they are treated as Functions. p  pGo supports inheritance arghhh head is blown clean off. you can compose a Struct which is made of another Struct, which has methods, that the Sub Struct now inherits...you getting this my mind is blown. Means that UML IS valid...fully but it feels dirty.p  pGo Does not support inheritance, it just appears so.  DFDs it is thenp

Negative 5813 pI decided to build my own social network from the ground up because I realized it would be an interesting exercise and I didnt want to spend a lot of time learning to customize an outofthebox solution like Drupal Commons. Ive done well so far with things like basic loginlogout functionality, creating a new user, uploading an avatar, etc. I also have a MySQL database table that holds posts by users.p  pRunning basic queries on the codepostscode table I can easily retrieve a post, its ID, and the user that created it userID is a foreign key from the codeuserscode table. However, I decided I wanted to implement a codethreadscode table with a codethreadIDcode. This way, posts can be sorted not only according to their date or postID, but by topic.p  pIm unsure of the logic for posting a new thread, however. My database consists of the following tables Users, Posts, Threads. In the database, they are structured like this only relevant fields shownp  precodeUsers         Posts         Threads                    userID pk   postID pk   threadID pk               userID fk                 threadID fk codepre  pemThe above formatting looks OK in the preview, I apologize if it goes totally wonky after I postemp  pUser creation is separate from post creation, therefore I already have a codeuserIDcode created and available when I make a new post. Then the post autogenerates its own postID. What is stopping me from moving forward is that I am not quite sure how to create a new codethreadIDcode strongandstrong codepostIDcode in the same transaction to ensure that they are properly aware of each other. The only time I would need a new threadID is if someone was, well, starting a new thread. Replies would use the existing threadID and get a unique postID.p  pIf anyone can shed some light on the basic logic of this transaction I would really appreciate it. I havent worked much with relational databases in the past so this is an opportunity to learn something useful, I think.p

Negative 5813 pIm trying to build a Pyramid application. I started with the SQLAlchemy scaffolding. Im running into a issue and Im wondering what the best way is to address it. In one of my views I need to select a lot of rows from two unrelated tables. I need to make sure no rows were inserted into the second table between the time I selected the rows from the first table and the time I selected the rows from the second table.p  pI have three models, codeNodecode, codeTestcode, and codeTaskingcode. Both codeNodescode and codeTestscode have quite a bit of metadata. Given a list of codeNodescode and a list of codeTestscode, a global list of codeTaskingscode can be created. For example, we could have three codeNodescode, codeacode, codebcode, and codeccode and two codeTestscode we need one node to do task codePcode and we need two nodes to do task codeQcode.p  pFrom that information, three codeTaskscode should be created. For examplep  ol liNode codeacode should do task codePcodeli liNode codebcode should do task codeQcodeli liNode codeccode should do task codeQcodeli ol  pNow, Im attempting to provide a REST API for this. The vast majority of time clients will be requesting the list of codeTaskscode, so that needs to be fast. However, sometimes a client might add a codeNodecode or a codeTestcode. When that happens, I need the entire list of codeTaskscode to be regenerated.p  pHeres a rough examplep  precodeviewconfigroutenamelisttaskings def listtaskingsrequest     return DBSession.QueryTasking.all  viewconfigroutenameaddnode def addnoderequest     DBSession.addNode     updatetaskings  viewconfigroutenameaddtest def addtestrequest     DBSession.addTest     updatetaskings  def updatetaskings     nodes  DBSession.queryNode.all     tests  DBSession.queryTest.all       Process...      Tasking.query.delete     for t in taskings         DBSession.addt codepre  pIm using the default Pyramid SQLAlchemy scaffolding. So, each request auto starts a transaction. So, if codeupdatetaskingcode is called from one request say codeaddnodecode, then the new node will be added to the local codeDBSessioncode, and querying for all codeNodescode and codeTestscode in codeupdatetaskingcode will return that new element. In addition, deleting all existing codeTaskingscode and adding the newly computed ones is also safe.p  pI have two problemsp  ol lipWhat happens if a new row is added into the codeTestscode table between the time I get my list of codenodescode and my list of codetestscode in codeupdatetaskingscode In my real world production system these selects are close together but not right next to each other. There is the possibility of a race condition.pli lipHow do I ensure two requests that will update the codeTaskingscode dont overwrite each other For example, imagine if our existing system had one codeNodecode and one codeTestcode. Two requests come in at the same, one to add a codeNodecode and one to add a codeTestcode. Even if problem 1 wasnt an issue and I knew that each requests pair of selects represented a single instance of time in the database, theres still the problem of one request overriding the other. If the first request finishes first with now two codeNodescode and one codeTestcode, the second request will still be selecting the old data potentially and will generate a list of codeTaskingscode with one codeNodecode and two codeTestscode.pli ol  pSo, whats the best way to deal with this Im using SQLite for development and PostgreSQL in production, but Id like a database agnostic solution. Im not worried about other applications accessing this database. My REST API will be the only access mechanism. Should I put a lock around any of requests that mutate the database adding a codeNodecode or a codeTestcode Should I lock the database somehowp  pThanks for any helpp

I basically want paste revisions so that if you open paste 1234, it shows all past revisions of that paste.p  pI thought of three waysp  pstrongMethod 1strongp  pHave a revisions table with id and oldid or something and for each ID, I would insert all old revisions, so if my structure looks like thisp  precoderev3 1234 rev2 1233 rev1 1232 codepre  pThe table will contain this datap  precode  id     oldid      1234   1233       1234   1232       1233   1232       codepre  pThe problem which I have with this is that it introduces a lot of duplicate data. And the more the revisions get, it has not only more data but I need to do N inserts for each new paste to the revisions table which is not great for a large N.p  pstrongMethod 2strongp  pI can add a childid to the paste table at the top and just update that. And then, when fetching the paste, I will keep querying the db for each childid and their childid and so on... But the problem is, that will introduce too many DB reads each time a paste with many revisions is opened.p  pstrongMethod 3strongp  pAlso involves a separate revisions table, but for the same scenario as method 1, it will store the data like thisp  precode  id     oldid             1234   1233,1232         1233   1232              codepre  pAnd when someone opens paste 1234, Ill use an IN clause to fetch all child paste data there.p  pWhich is the best approach Or is there a better approach I am using Laravel 4 framework that has Eloquent ORM.p  pstrongEDITstrong Can I do method 1 with a oneToMany relationship I understand that I can use a hrefhttpfour.laravel.comdocseloquenteagerloading relnofollow titleEager LoadingEager Loadinga to fetch all the revisions, but how can I insert them without having to do a dirty hackp  pstrongEDITstrong I figured out how to handle the above.

Negative 5813 pI have many Python scripts that output CSV files. It is occasionally convenient to open these files in Excel. After installing OS X Mavericks, Excel no longer opens these files properly Excel doesnt parse the files and it duplicates the rows of the file until it runs out of memory. Specifically, when Excel attempts to open the file, a prompt appears that reads File not loaded completely. p  pExample of code Im using to generate the CSV filesp  precodeimport csv with opencsvtest.csv, wb as f     writer  csv.writerf     writer.writerow[1,2,3]     writer.writerow[4,5,6] codepre  pEven the simple file generated by the above code fails to load in Excel. However, if I open the CSV file in a text editor and copypaste the text into Excel, parse it with text to columns, and then save as CSV from Excel, then I can reopen the CSV file in Excel without issue. Do I need to pass an additional parameter in my scripts to make Excel parse the CSV files the same way it used to Or is there some setting I can change in OS X Mavericks or Excel Thanks.p

Negative 5813 pLets assume there is a kind of a function, which could be both global function or could be implemented as class member const function not static, static means global. It depends on users choice if the function will be called or not called at all. Let say  It is usually not called or called rare  in very special cases. I am not interested of the programs logic organization. My question is about the memory usage. I know that data member function costs a little bit more one pointer more, since it is called trough an object. What about the case if the function is not called in runtime If it is global function it will be resident in memory during programs lifelong no matter it is called or not. What about the case of data member function, since it is called through and object that is dynamically created, respectively  not created at all, what about the memory needed for the function, where it will be placed and what happens if an object is not created at allp  pThanks.p

Negative 5813 pIn a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6Z4BY3 relnofollowthis fiddlea Ive implemented a list with a click handler. When an element in the list is clicked the .selected class is added to it which changes its height. When a different list element is subsequently clicked the .selected class is removed from the previously clicked element thus restoring it to its original height and the .selected class is added to the newly clicked element altering its height.p  pNotice in the a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6Z4BY4 relnofollowfiddlea that when a list element is clicked and the .selected element is below it in the list the clicked element stays perfectly still while it expands and the previously selected element contracts. However when a list element is clicked and the .selected element is above it in the list, the list scrolls up to compensate for the contracting element causing the newly .selected list element to move up a little. I would like some mechanism for smoothly mitigating this behavior so the .selected list element stays perfectly still in this circumstance.p  pHtmlp  precodeltulgt  ltligt1ltligt  ltligt2ltligt  ltligt3ltligt  ltligt4ltligt  ltligt5ltligt  ltligt6ltligt  ltligt7ltligt  ltligt8ltligt  ltligt9ltligt  ltligt10ltligt ltulgt codepre  pjsp  precodedocument.readyfunction       li.clickfunction           .selected.removeClassselected         this.addClassselected       codepre  pcssp  precodeli     width100     bordertopsolid black 1px     height100px     backgroundgreen   .selected     height300px     backgroundred  codepre

For example the xml would look similar to p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltTablesgt     ltTable1gt         ltTYPEgtTest1ltTYPEgt         ltDATEgt20140116ltDATEgt         ltFLAGgtTrueltFLAGgt     ltTable1gt     ltTable1gt         ltTYPEgtTest2ltTYPEgt         ltDATEgt20140115ltDATEgt         ltFLAGgtFalseltFLAGgt     ltTable1gt     ltTable1gt         ltTYPEgtTest1ltTYPEgt         ltDATEgt20140114ltDATEgt         ltFLAGgtTrueltFLAGgt     ltTable1gt ltTablesgt codepre  pSo I would like the library to iterate through all the xml elements and unmarshal into a list of java objects which so far works, however as it iterates I would like to add additional functionality to check the Type and Flag element values, if TYPE value equals Test2 and or if Flag value equals False to ignore this child element all together and not include it in the finished list of Java objects. Does anyone know if this is possible with either JaxB or Xstream Alternatively, can anyone suggest maybe a better approach to accomplish this which requires minimum code and manual parsing. p  pI have been looking at ValidationEventHandler and XmlAdapter in JaxB but I do not think these will allow me do what I want. I got close with the Xmldapter however the unmarshal has to return either null or an object for each xml child element it processes, it also changed the xml syntax to attribute form i.e TYPE  Test1 etc which I did not see any way of altering. p  pXstream allows you to implement a Converter which has a canConvert method, however this only works on Class type, and not child element type which I weant to check for each child element. Had a look at MapperWrapper wrapMapper method which can be overloaded in Xstream, but it only shows element attribute name, i.e FLAG and does not show value, also if it did show value I do not see anyway of telling the function to ignore child root element and all attributes for said child. p  pAnyway, thats my two cent. Any advice p

It runs a couple of classes, to create databases and users, to download frameworks and so on. Also it should run a couple of shell commands for administration purpose with root permissions.

Negative 5813 pIm trying to register an implementation of FluentValidation.IValidator using a Unity configuration file.p  pThe implementation of the Validator is in a referenced assembly.

Negative 5813 pI was wondering what is the most efficient way to communicate between an android application and a java software on a computer through wifi. I used rmi by sending signal every 10 seconds to know if my devices are still connected to rmi server on my computer.p  pBut the main problem is that use RMI to communicate is not really efficient and when many devices try to communicate with the computer I got some timeout exception because my access point cant handle all data send.p  pThats why I tried to find the less data consuming to communicate and know when devices are connected or not to my application. I probably can still use RMI for punctual action but send an RMI packet every 10 seconds is probably not the best wayp  pThanks.p

Negative 5813 pOk Im stumped on this one. This regards the builtin draggable sort functionality you use for basic blocks or organizing books. Im using the latest Firefox on Fedora 20. I also use profiles, meaning different instances of Firefox with separate caches and addons. However, in both profiles, I am logging into my Drupal site with the same credentials. p  pstrongThe Problemstrong For the last few days my primary browser has suddenly stopped showing the draggable handles in any primary Firefox profile. Inspection of the code shows that they are receiving a display none element style in every case. However, this is happening only in one of my Firefox profiles. If I could even duplicate the problem in my other profile Id have some clues, but I cant get them to disappear there any more than I can get them to come back in my primary.

Negative 5813 pI noticed on MIT app inventor that there is no way to clear a canvas without using the .clear method. This means that you would have to manually redraw the whole screen every time you update it, right So, what do you do in order to avoid blinking when you redraw your objects. Is there a way to have a whole canvas behind the first in order to avoid blinking, and then update it, or do you just have to deal with the blinking how it is.p  pI realize that it is quite possible to make an arraylist of every pixel on the screen, with an int for the RGB value of each pixel, and then just draw to that list. Then you can simply copy the array to the screen to render. I think this would be excessively slow and tedious in a language as simple as MIT app inventor.p

Restart the program, and they might reappear. its pretty intermittent.p  pI have confirmed that there are no entries in the child collection through logging amp debuggingp  precode    private ObservableCollectionltOrderLinegt LoadOrderLines              Log.DebugLoading 0 order lines..., this.Model.OrderLines.Count          var result  new ObservableCollectionltOrderLinegt          foreach var orderLine in this.Model.OrderLines                      result.AddorderLine                   return result      codepre  pSometimes it will say Loading 0 order lines... and sometimes Loading 4 order lines... for the same order.p  pI cant use Eager Loading when I load the list of orders because I dont want to load all the order lines for all the orders when only a few of them might ever be opened  I need to keep the loading as fast as possible and only load things as they are needed, hence lazy loading.p  pIts not only the Orders object that it is happening on, it sometimes happens on other child collections too, but the effect is exactly the same.p  pAnybody have any idea why EF is doing this and what I can do to fix it Its a huge problem  I cant have empty order lines in my program when they should be therep  pstrongemExtra info that may or my not be of useemstrongp  pThis is a WPF MVVM application.

Negative 5813 pHeres my requirement Using DirectX11 via SlimDX I have to download a series of verteces and use them to create a Texture2D of a map of county borders. Then I need to do the same thing with state borders, and draw them over the county borders. Then, I need to take that texture and create 2 different textures from it, each containing unique radar data. Then I want to take those textures and display them so that the user can look at, for example, base reflectivity and base velocity side by side. The user should be able to zoom in and out of particular areas of the map.p  pHeres what Ive got working Im creating my Texture2D without multisampling or depth on a billboard which is displaying in 2 separate views. But it looks blocky, and if you zoom too far out, some of the borders start to disappear.p  pHere are my issuesp  p1 I cant for the life of me get any multisampling quality. Im using an ATI Radeon HD 5750, so I know it must be able to do it, but no formats Ive tried support a quality greater than 0.p  p2 Im uncertain whether I need to use a depth stencil since Im drawing all these textures on top of each other. I hope not because when I try, the ShaderResourceView says, Puny Human You cannot use a depth stencil format in a ShaderResourceView Bwa ha ha Im embellishingp  pIm willing to bet that a lot of these issues would be solved if I just drew the primitives directly into the world space, but when I do that rendering takes way too long because there are so many lines to render. Is there perhaps a way I can cut down on the time it takesp  pAnd heres the code of my last working versionp  precodeusing SlimDX using SlimDX.D3DCompiler using SlimDX.Direct3D11 using SlimDX.DXGI

Negative 5813 pthis is my first question on StackOverflow and I am quite new to programming so please bear with me  So I want to learn programming and I started with JAVA, the basics, classes, variables, methods and all that stuff. It went quite good until I stumbled over the term Interface. I didnt understand it by what was written on a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavaconceptsinterface.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavaconceptsinterface.htmla and I am finding myself now browsing the web to understand it but I dont seem to find the right, easily explained answer. I dont get the usage of interfaces... p  pI try to make an examplep  pSo I know how to declare an interface and I know how to implement it into a class..p  pThe interfacep  precodeinterface motor       void speedUpint increment   codepre  pA classp  precodepublic class Bicycle implements motor       int speed  0      void speedUpint increment       speed  speed  increment            codepre  pSo now I could use the interface of the Bicycle class byp  precodeBicycle.speedUp10 codepre  pBut I dont understand what do I need the Interface for Because I could use the method in the same fashion without having the interface. Even if I have more classes that use this interface, Id still have to create the method speedUp individually in each class because the interface demands it so why not just leave it out in the first place I hope you understand my problem and I am looking forward to your answers p  pCheersp
Negative 5813 pI would like to write a QTC based file manager from scratch.p  pBut I only just barely understand the basics of C, and have never written a single application in QT All I know is that as an end user I have always preferred QT over GTK I have also never actually developed anything for Linux yet.p  pI have never written anything like a file manager Ive mostly dealt with just console based applications so far, GUI programming is new to me apart from HTMLCSS and some basic WPF, so I just dont know where exactly to begin nor where to go from there.p  pTo sum it up, I need some guidance to know the path of least resistance of where to start when writing a file manager. What do I read first What do I write first What should I write lastp  pSorry for the question being so vague, I am just really confused.p  pOff Topicp  pFor anyone wondering why, I have searched high and low, but never found on Linux a file manager that I could love. I want to mimic the Windows 7 explorer a lot in functionality to the level that anyone who has used the Windows Explorer will feel right at home with what I am trying to cook up. And performance speed, not lightweight although I do feel the two hold hands a bit is my nr. 1 priority. I would have forked a high performance file manager like Thunar or SpaceFM, but they are both GTK based and I just absolutely did not want to use GTK. I also could have forked Dolphin but I dont want any KDE dependencies either.p

Negative 5813 pI have a site where users are prompted to download files from external resources. Since the external file names are hashed and the user downloads multiple files, its very hard for users to know which file they download reaches what resource they requested. For instance, the file name of codefdae442dafe42.zipcode could be codeproductionresources.zipcode.p  pIm looking for ways to have it so the browser will download the file as a different name. Below are some of my ideas and why they wont work, but you may be able to find a workaround.p  pJust a note, I dont have any control over the external resource. I wont be able to make changes to the headers or anything else. My service is a website that mostly targets Desktop Users. Android and iOS solutions wont be that beneficial.p  pstrong Download Attributestrongp  pThis method was working for a while in Google Chrome and Firefox, but then they started to follow the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRhtml5links.htmldownloadingresourcesW3 HTML5 speca. The external resource requires to send the header of codeContentDispositioncode in which Google Chrome and Firefox didnt check before.p  pstrongPHP Proxy Downloadstrongp  pI know that I could have a PHP script make a request to the external resource and then deliver it to the end user while changing the headers and name to fit my needs. The issue is the site has high traffic and each user downloads about 12GB of data. My servers are not able to handle this type of traffic and upgrading the server will probably be too costly.p  pstrongRename Files with External Applicationstrongp  pI was considering using an external application Possibly a Chrome  Firefox Extension that will rename the files after they finish downloading. But considering a large enough of my audience are one time visitors, asking them to download an application or extension is very unlikely.p  pstrongFlash or Java Embedded Solutionsstrongp  pI am considering using a Java or Flash embedded file that will handle the file downloads, but I dont know enough about either platform. From what I can tell, Flash doesnt have much control over the users file system, so this could be an issue. Java will be able to do this task, but I was really hoping I wouldnt have to use Java since its often insecure and requires a large download to install it same issue as External Software idea.p  hr  pIf you have any ideas on what I could possibly do to solve this issue, they would be greatly appreciated. Im not looking for any code, just ideas on how I will be able to accomplish the above task. I would like to thank you all for your time and expertise. p

Problem is the apps function well when I test them in Dreamweaver, and in the XDK emulator  good response, speed and expected results. But when I build the app in XDK and install it on my android phone, its performance is terrible  I have to wait about 10 secs after touching before the new page loads jqueryMobile 1.0jquery 1.5. Sometimes, when I touch a button, the current page first flicks a bit before it loads the next page, though it loads almost immediately. jqueryMobile 1.4.2jquery1.10.2p  pWhat could be the cause of this performance difference, and can I get a fix to itp

Negative 5813 pI have recently been modifying Grafikas codeTextureMovieEncodercode to create a recording of what I displayed onscreen two Sprite2ds which are overlapping. Using the codeCameraCaptureActivitycode example as a reference point, I effectively ported what I created for my rendering thread into the codeTextureMovieEncodercode but the output is jagged lines across the screen. I think I understand whats wrong, but I dont know how to fix itp  pSome codep  precodeprivate void prepareEncoderEGLContext sharedContext, int width, int height, int bitRate,         File outputFile      try          mVideoEncoder  new VideoEncoderCorewidth, height, bitRate, outputFile      catch IOException ioe          throw new RuntimeExceptionioe          mEglCore  new EglCoresharedContext, EglCore.FLAGRECORDABLE     mInputWindowSurface  new WindowSurfacemEglCore, mVideoEncoder.getInputSurface, true     mInputWindowSurface.makeCurrent      textureProgram  new Texture2dProgramTexture2dProgram.ProgramType.TEXTUREEXT      backgroundDrawable  new Drawable2dDrawable2d.Prefab.RECTANGLE     backgroundRect  new Sprite2dbackgroundDrawable     frontDrawable  new Drawable2dDrawable2d.Prefab.RECTANGLE     frontRect  new Sprite2dfrontDrawable      backgroundRect.setTexturebackTextureId     frontRect.setTexturefrontTextureId      updateGeometry   private void handleFrameAvailableTransform transform, long timestampNanos      if VERBOSE Log.dTAG, handleFrameAvailable tr  transform     mVideoEncoder.drainEncoderfalse      backgroundRect.drawtextureProgram, transform.movieMatrix     frontRect.drawtextureProgram, transform.cameraMatrix      mInputWindowSurface.setPresentationTimetimestampNanos     mInputWindowSurface.swapBuffers  codepre  pI think the problem comes down to my lack of understanding of how to establish the right projection onto the codeWindowSurfacecode for the codeVideoEncodercode. In the Grafika example, codeFullFrameRectcode is used, which is easier since you can just use the identity matrix to stretch a given texture to the surface area. However, since I want to create the overlapping effect, I needed to use Sprite2d. Is the problem the shared EGLContext Do I need to create a new one so that I can set the viewport to match the codeWindowSurfacecode size A bit lost on where to go from here.p

Negative 5813 pI have some data with 15 variables, including some missing values. When I tried to look at the Frequency charts with the count and percentages of missing values, it was showing all variables without any missing values. In the variable view, I changed the Missing column from None to Discrete missing values, which was  to include the missing values. This showed the correct numbers of missing values for each variable.p  pI then went to Transform  Replace Missing Values to replace these missing values, but the only variables that appear as an option are the variables that are not missing any values. I tried going back to the variable view and changing all of the Missing column values back to None from , but that didnt help.p  pAll of the variables that do appear in the Replace Missing Variables box are also numeric.

Negative 5813 pIt seems to me that I am fundamentally misunderstanding the purpose of Robolectric. Ive been battling with it for a week already, and so far getting a new error message is considered as making progress. I am able to test some basic stuff like static views in an activity, but when something more complicated things come into play things just fall apart. I had to extend Robolectric to support 3rd party libraries with certain parameters, Appcompat action bars and numerous other things which was extremely timeconsuming and wasnt really documented anywhere, and things are advancing at a pretty much glacial pace. I am starting to think that I am using it in a wrong way and it simply isnt supposed to do what I want it to do.p  pThe general app logic is quite straightforward so there isnt really much to unit test, the most complicated stuff is in the UI and remote API calls. Is Robolectric just supposed to make unit testing for Android less painful than with JUnit because it can run on the JVM and supports a few Android classes Perhaps a blackbox behaviour testing framework like Espresso would be more suitable for my needs But we use continuos integration, and Robolectric was nice and easy to set up to run tests on the CI server, and Id kind of like to keep it that way.p  pWhat do you use Robolectric for A lot of blog posts recommend it for activity lifecycle testing, but since Im also quite new in the Android world, I dont really understand the purpose of it, especially since the app Im testing is portraitonly. Could someone please give an overview of what you use Robolectric for, and how do you do it, preferably with code examples and explain why and how those tests are important p

Negative 5813 pSo guys, Im learning constraints with prolog, and trying to implement a little puzzle using this new knowledge.p  pThe goal of the puzzle is simple I have a square grid with some numbers on topbelow each column and on the rightleft of each row. The domain of values goes from 0 to Gridsize 1, wich means, a grid 7x7 can have numbers from 0 to 6. The constraints are as followp  ul liEach number can only apear once each row and once each columnli liThe number on topright are the sum of the First and Last digits on the columnrow respectivelyli liThe number on bottomleft are the sum of the Second and SecondLast digits on the columnrow respectivelyli liZeros dont count as digits, are only on the program to represent blank spacesli ul  pFor an examplep  pcodeTopConstraint      [7, 6, 4, 7, 3]  RightConstraint    [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]  BottomConstraint   [3, 4, 6, 3, 7]  LeftConstraint     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]codep  pThis constraints can have a 0 too, wich make the program simple ignore the sum can be any number, if it goes accordingly with the other restrictions.p  pOne solution to the above lists would be the matrixp  pcode  3  4  1     2  1  3  2  4    2     4  1  3     1  3  2  4  4  2     3  1 codep  pNow the problem is my constraints somehow arent applying, and the program isnt giving me the solution.p  pAfter puting the right domain and putting all columnrow cells differentwich without any other restrictions it gives me the expected solution, I have this code to apply to each cell, the sum restrictionsp  pcode putrestrictionsSol, Gridsize, SumT, SumR, SumB, SumL                             putrestrictionsrowSol, Gridsize, SumR, SumL, 1,                             putrestrictionscolSol, Gridsize, SumT, SumB, 1. code Where Gridsize is the Gridsize to make iterations upon it, SumT, SumR, SumB, SumL, are the above constraint lists respectively, and 1 to start the iteration counter.p  pSo this predicates are where my problem residesp  precodeputrestrictionscol, Gridsize, , , X  X gt Gridsize, writeend putrestrictionscol,nl. putrestrictionscolGrid, Gridsize, [SumTHSumTT], [SumBHSumBT], X

Negative 5813 pit was kind of hard to explain this in the title but i want to do is make an interactive tutorial, where the user clicks on the area or product he wants to clean or to clean with, and then another box pops up with information, and when that part is done you continue with another box and so on... so i end up with like 78 boxes after another, and with like 30 products and 30

Negative 5813 pIm trying to understand what happens with IPython parallels noncopying sendreceive of numpy arrays. I understand that the noncopying receive of a message is readonly, but this leads me to expect that the numpy array that I receive acts like a view, pointing to the original array at least on shared memory machines. I would then expect that if the numpy array is modified on one of the compute nodes, my view of that array in the notebook would be updated, however, that doesnt seem to be the case. To demonstrate whats confusing me, the codep  precodefrom IPython.parallel import Client dv  Client[]  with dv.syncimports     import numpy   dv.executea  numpy.zeros2 print dv[a] mya  dv[a][1]  my copy of the array in the notebook  mya[0]  1  cant assign to mya because it is readonly dv.executea[1]  1  update the arrays on the compute nodes print mya  value of mya is not updated print dv[a]  even though the arrays are updated on the compute nodes codepre  phas outputp  precodeimporting numpy on engines [array[ 0.,  0.], array[ 0.,  0.], array[ 0.,  0.], array[ 0.,  0.]] [ 0.  0.] [array[ 0.,  1.], array[ 0.,  1.], array[ 0.,  1.], array[ 0.,  1.]] codepre  pI would think that the point of having the noncopying sends is to save memory by having every view of the array point to the same chunk of memory, but that doesnt seem to be the case here. What is happening under the hood, and how am I misunderstanding the use of the noncopying sendsp  pThe context of my main question above is a shared memory environment my laptop, but a possibly related question I have is how do noncopying sends of numpy arrays work and what is their use in the distributed memory case, where compute nodes are different physical machines and you must I assume send the numpy arrays over the network effectively making a copy on the receiving machine, so having a view to the original memory location wouldnt make sense.p

Negative 5813 pI have read countless articles and tried countless methods for accomplishing this, but my results still fall lacking. I would emneverem resort to a forum, if I had the option, but by this point, the internet has failed me and I am desperate.p  hr  pOver the past monthorso, I have devotedly been teaching myself PHP. By this point, I have a beautifully working email contact form with heavy, working validation and a successful result upon submit all while using the REQUEST method.p  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrong Regarding errors, my original setup was to direct my visitor to a separate error page that explained the reason for their error. Directly after the error message text, a backbutton would be provided to return the viewer to their form, allowing them to finishfix their answers  still with all the form fields filled out. THIS WORKS. This works beautifully, but making my visitor go through emtwoem redirects just to finish their form was unacceptable, to me. I wanted my error to show up on the same page, still with all previouslysubmitted form fields filled out.p  pWith a ton more internet research done, I ACCOMPLISHED THIS, TOO, but only HALFWAY. This was done by simply adding urlenclodes to my headerLocation errorredirects. THIS HALFWAY WORKS. They hit submit, and if theres an error, it redirects back to the form page with the error listed at the top. strongThe problem is that the form fields are no longer filled, using this method.strong Big userunfriendly problem.p  hr  pstrongIN SUMMARYstrongp  ul liI have a successfully working and validating email contact form, all while using the REQUEST methodli liIn my HTML form, each input value presently echos the htmlentitiesInputVariable associated with said input field.li liThe Value echos WORK in retaining form data upon backbuttonreturn, but DONT WORK upon redirect or refreshli liUpon the chance of an error, the form is redirected to the form page using header with the specific error messages included in a urlencode.li liRedirect works, error message works, strongform fields no longer filled.strongli ul  hr  pstrongI HAVE TRIED and Failedstrongp  ul liEvery sessionstart SESSION method and tutorial that the internet seems to be able to provide me with [which I find weird, granted the sessionstart works for the urlencode redirects, but not for refilling the form fields.

It seems only possible to specify an encoding for the plugin itself, but this would lead in both files being filtered using the same encoding.p  pIdeally I would like to specify something likep  ul li.properties  filter using ISO88591li li.xml  filter using UTF8li li.pdf  do not filterli lianything else  filter using default encodingli ul  pThis doesnt feel like a very unusual situation, is there an easy way to configure thisp

Negative 5813 pI am building a new Django project. For example sake, lets say that its for managing multiple car dealerships. Perhaps a parent company owns 510 distinct dealerships, with each dealership being in a different city with its own staff and its own inventory.p  pIm trying to figure out how best to create the Django project to handle this structure. I want a high level view where management can view all dealerships and their aggregate data, but then can drill down and manage each specific dealership and all its data. So something like thisp  ul liMain project is for managing car dealershipsli liMain project needs to have some high level data such as ul liOverview of all dealershipsli liOverview of financial data which is the aggregate of all individual dealership financialsli liAbility to add new dealershipsli ulli ul  pBut then each emdealershipem needs the following info, which is all specific to emthatem dealershipp  ul liStaff of dealershipli liInventory of that dealershipli liFinancials for that dealershipli ul  pLooking at it from just emoneem dealership makes it all very easy, multiple apps within the main project codeStaffcode app, codeInventorycode app, etc.. Im thinking that, even with multiple dealerships, I can still have that approach separate apps for different areas. p  pBut what Im struggling with a bit is the URL patterns. Normally, the URLs might be setup like thisp  precodetoplevel , inventory inventory, include inventoryappurls, financials financials, include financialappurls, codepre  pThe thing is, if I have multiple dealerships I want to view emallem the URLs, filtered based on that one dealership. So all URLs need to show their data, filtered on the one dealership.  Even things like creating a new staff member, it needs to be something like codedealershipAcontactsnewcode or looking at financials would be codedealershipAfinancialsoverviewcode.p  pThen, to change dealerships, Id go to the dashboard page which would be to top level for the whole project and select a different dealership. Now all URLs need to be filtered on emthatem dealership. Something like codedealershipBcontactsnewcode and codedealershipBfinancialsoverviewcodep  pBasically, Im trying to figure out how to design the project, and the URLs properly, given this projectwide filtering concept, where all URLs change, based on which dealership youre looking at. Is there some Djangoesque way of doing this p

Negative 5813 pI use Ruby on Rails application with MongoDB and Mongoid to process some data. During a run time application executes millions of queries and I keep terminal window where rails server is running open to watch processes. After program finish running consumption of memory using by terminal consuming 13GB. If I start program to run again  consumption of memory will keep to grow and at the end it will be 26GB. I tried to do the same in production without using terminal and free virtual memory dropped almost to 0. It coming back to normal after closing terminal in development or rebooting linux instance in production. I am guessing that this memory used by MongoDB.

Negative 5813 pso im making a pizza program in Python 3.3 that takes input from the user and prints the amount of pizzas needed. Every pizza is cut into 8 slices.

Negative 5813 pWe have recently decided to switch from asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc for some new projects. As a long time webforms developer I have watched and read quite a lot of introductory tutorials and how to switch articles and videos. However some things still bug me no pun intended a litte bit. And Im hoping I could get some answers from the community here.p  pFirst, we have a cmssystem that we are required to use for a client. In the system they obviously manage the navigation menu for the webproject. My first question is, how would I go about to adding this dynamic navigation to all the pages views. In webforms I would simply create a custom user control and throw it onto the masterpage or template. I suspect the answer to be viewmodels Or partial viewsp  pThe second question is related. Often we would have a few pages that show some news for example in a side panel. Others would not. Would I create a different viewmodel for the different scenarios, work with sectionsp  pI dont expect a definite answer, but more some guidelinesbest practices. Any input is appreciated.p

Negative 5813 pTLDR Im writing a simple TomcatSpringFreemarker webapp and seem to be having a lot of trouble getting Springs DispatcherServlet to honor codeltmvcresources...gtcode configuration.  p  pstrongPLEASE NOTEstrong AFAICT this is not a duplicate of other questions since Ive tried the solutions given in other answers.  If someone finds an existing question and that question provides a solution I missed, Ill gladly VTC as a dup or delete this question if desired.p  pI have a very simple webapp based on Freemarker.  That part is working fine.  I have a single requesthandler method to handle all requests codeRequestMappingcode but wish to serve static resources codecontextPathstatic...code using the codeltmvcresources...gtcode facility.  The resources are located in subdirectories of the toplevel webapp directory.p  pBased on reading other questions on SO I added p  precodeltmvcresources mappingstatic location gt  codepre  pto my Spring configuration. p  pNo matter what I do, requests that I expect to be resolved as a static resource file are being sent to the request handler method of my controller instead.  The only thing I can think of is that the codeRequestMappingcode annotation has precedence over codemvcresourcescode, but that doesnt make a lot of sense.p  pI have verified that the resource URLs are being generated correctly, i.e. the template linep  precodeltlink relstylesheet hrefcontextPathstaticcssgallery.cssgt codepre  pgeneratesp  precodeltlink relstylesheet hrefgallerystaticcssgallery.cssgt codepre  pand the request is being received by the Tomcat server, just routed to the wrong place.p  pIve read most of the questions on SO about this subject and I believe Im doing it right see for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9898590tryingtogetmvcresourcestoservemystaticresources98994349899434Trying to get mvc resources to serve my static resourcesa, but clearly Im missing something obvious.p  pstrongemEnvironmentemstrongp  ul liEclipse Lunali liJava 8li liTomcat 8li liFreemarker 2.3.23li liSpring 4.2.0li liWindows 7 SP1li ul  pstrongemDeployed Layoutemstrongp  pStandard Java EE Tomcat directory structurep  precodewebapps   gallery       css       images       js       METAINF       WEBINF           classes           lib           views codepre  pstrongemTomcat Context Definitionemstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltContext docBaseDdevtoolsapachetomcat8.0.24wtpwebappsgallery           pathgallery reloadabletrue           sourceorg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.servergallerygt codepre  pstrongemSpring Servlet Configemstrongp  pcodeWEBINFmainservlet.xmlcodep  precode... ltmvcresources mappingstatic location gt ltmvcannotationdrivengt ltcontextcomponentscan basepackagecom.mysite.gallerygt ... codepre  pIve tried all possible orderings of these statements but that seems to have no effect.

Negative 5813 pTake a look at how it is possible to output all of the characters from a single byte character set printable or not. The output file will contain Japanese characters such as .p  precodeEncoding enc  Encoding.GetEncodingshiftjis byte[] mbytes  new  byte [1] StreamWriter sw  new StreamWriterCshiftjis.txt  for int i  0 i lt 256 i      mbytes.SetValue bytei,0     String Output  enc.GetStringmbytes     sw.WriteLineOutput   sw.Close sw.Dispose codepre  pHere is my attempt to do this with a double byte character set.p  precodeEncoding enc  Encoding.GetEncodingiso2022jp byte[] mbytes  new byte[2] StreamWriter sw  new StreamWriterCiso2022jp.txt  for int i  0 i lt 256 i      mbytes.SetValuebytei, 0      for int j  0 j lt 256 j              mbytes.SetValuebytej, 1         String Output  null         Output  enc.GetStringmbytes         sw.WriteLineOutput        sw.Close sw.Dispose codepre  pThe problem is the output file still only contains the first 255 characters. Each byte is evaluated separately and gives the character back for that byte individually. The output string always contains two characters and not one. Since characters in the character set are represented with two bytes you must have to specify them with two bytes rightp  pSo how do you iterate through and print all characters from a double byte character setp

Everything seems nice, however I could not find any strict rules or guidelines on how to pack the encoded video frames inside the media segment described in the W3C specification. p  pAs far as I understand I have to emit media segments that contain clusters with block elements inside. From what I understand I can use a simple block element for each frame I get from the encoder since it has a single timestamp. But how to organize clusters For me it makes sense to emit a single cluster for each frame with a single simple block entry to reduce buffering and lag. Is such approach considered normal or are there any drawbacks to doing so and I should buffer for some time interval and then emit a cluster that contains multiple simple block elements covering the buffered time periodp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo I implemented the described approach emitting clusters with single simple block entry and the video seems to lag a lot so presumably this is not the way to go.p

Negative 5813 pThe other day, I started thinking of how a regex engine would be implemented, and one potential problem I came up with involves zerowidth lookaheads and repetition. For example, when matching the regex extra parentheses to avoid invalid syntax codexcode on the string codexxcode would try to match the inner group as many times as possible. Since, starting at the beginning of the string, the ZWLA passes, its considered a match, but doesnt consume any characters. Thus, one might believe the regex engine could enter an infinite loop.p  pWhen tested in GNU C11, coderegexmatchcode returned codefalsecode.p  pWhen tested on a hrefhttpsregex101.comjavascript relnofollowregex101a, it DID return a match.p  pWould this kind of regex construct be considered illformed Or is there a standard behavior for this kind of thingp

Negative 5813 pWe are developing a big data solution in which one requirement is to process incoming emails. The technology stack is not finalized yet but mostly we might go with Sendmail as MTA and Procmail as MDA. We are open to any other very efficient solution.p  pThese emails are essentially carry data in attachments and are not meant for end user, so the email flow ends with Spark processing.p  pMy first thought was it would be great if there was a message queuing system such as ApacheKafka which could accept emails as messages and then provide them to the client such as Spark on demand but it seems that sort of technologyapproach is not available in any of the message brokering systems.p  pThis means we would have to receive emails via SMTP MTA and then extract the information from the MDA. p  pWe could use Procmail to extract the contents of the email and the attachments and put them in a folder per email and then scan the folders and process them in spark.p  pAlternatively if Spark has any plugins which could pull in emails from an MDA and break it down into its attachments it would make life much simpler.p  pIf there is any other smarter solution it would be welcome.p  pSo the fundamental question is what technology is available for channelizing emails through Spark for processing. Connectors etc.p

Negative 5813 pThis is a general decision tree algorithm question of using attributes to split nodes based on entropy. I am using a Decision Tree algorithm in SQL Server Data Mining to predict the type of an animal. What I noticed was that the same input column  attribute is used twice to split the node. My understanding was that an input column  attribute could only be used once for splitting a node. For example, below reptiles is used to split each value of animals  1 and 0 . Based on what I have read so far, for a decision tree, once an input column  attribute is used to split a node value, you should not be using it again. You pick an attribute from remaining set of UNused attributes. Please let me know  correct me if I am wrong. Each attribute can take value of 1 or 0. I can understand reptiles 1 and reptiles0 when animals1. But once reptiles has been used as an attribute for a split, I dont understand why it is being used again for the animals0 split.p  precode                    reptiles1 gt     animals1 gt                                reptiles0 gt codepre  pAll   p  precode                    reptiles0 gt     animals0 gt                      reptiles1 gt  codepre
