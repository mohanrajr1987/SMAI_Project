Negative 6250 pI have thought of this idea where you could have a tab control on a form, but instead of defining each tabs controls before runtime, inherit or use another forms controls.p  pBasically a tab control is in place on the main form that has no tabs on it before runtime.

Assume a generic situation where codeMyClasscode is declared in codeMyClass.hcode and defined in codeMyClass.cppcode, and similarly for codeYourClasscode.]emp  pI can think of a few, but being far from an expert, I guess you could name several othersp  pstrongContainmentstrong This can come in several flavors, with direct containment of a codeYourClasscode object being one option, while containing a pointer or reference to the object being another optionp  precodeclass MyClass  public    Some MyClass members... private   YourClass instance   or YourClass instance  YourClassamp instance    Some other MyClass members...  codepre  pstrongastrong Of course, direct containment is convenient, but I can think of one immediate drawback if codeYourClasscode is a bit hefty in terms of memory requirement, and you have several codeMyClasscode instances as in my linked question, containing the object directly will be out of the question. Besides, the emhasaem relationship does not always make sense.p  pstrongbstrong Having a pointer or a reference to the object might make better sense in that case. Using a reference has the problem that you might end up referring to an object which does not exist anymore, so you have to make sure that the codeYourClasscode object exists for the duration of the existence of the codeMyClasscode object.p  pstrongcstrong In the case of a pointer, the problem above still exists, but you can more easily reassign the pointer to a new object.p  pstrongInheritancestrong One can inherit from the codeYourClasscode object, so that the members are inherited, such asp  precodeclass MyClass  public YourClass  public    Some MyClass members... private    Some other MyClass members...  codepre  pstrongastrong This is also very simple to set up for a few classes, but may become unwieldy for general use. For example, if codeYourClasscode was a random number generator, it wouldnt necessarily make sense to say codeMyClasscode emisaem random number generator. One can of course define a wrapper class for the random number generator, say call it codeRandomizablecode and then codeMyClasscode could inherit from codeRandomizablecode, which makes good sense.p  pI would personally like to know more about the pros and cons of static members, global objects, singletons, and how they are correctly used. So, from a meta point of view, what other methods or patterns would work p  pemPS. Though Im asking from a C perspective, I guess the same could be said to apply for many other object oriented languages, so dont worry about giving examples in other languages.emp

Negative 6250 pMy coworker wants to use a singleton patttern in javascript to refer to objects which, in our current application, can only be created once.  p  pConversely, I want to refer to these objects using a namespaced global object.p  pHis argument is that if it is ever allowable to create more than one of these objects, the refactoring cost will be lower when using singletons, because less of the code will have to change.  p  pFor instance lets say we have an application with a large central interface element, like the map in Google Maps. p  pI generally want to access the map from the application code likep  precodeApplication.interface.map.zoom10 codepre  pHe wants to access the map throughout the application code likep  precodevar map  new Map  This is invisibly a singleton map.zoom10 codepre  pFor instance the code in a codeButtonsControlcode class representing the buttons controlling the map would have to access the map somehow to reflect the user input. Should it access the map using codenewcode or codeApplicationcodep  pIts about as unlikely in our application that wed have to create another instance of the map, but lets say we do someday...p  pMy argument is that the cost now of reading code like his using codenewcode outweighs whatever benefit we might gain later when refactoring that code to allow multiple maps. The cost is incurred in reading code like his and trying to understand what it does.p  pFor instance, when reading the code in codeButtonsControlcode, you might be horrified to see that, apparently, a codenew Mapcode is being created in your codeButtonsControlcode constructor, and be compelled to investigate Maps code to make sure thats not really happening. Either tracking that down or already having to know that codenew Mapcode is a singleton is what incurs the cost in using codenew Mapcode, whereas reading codeApplication.interface.Mapcode is obvious and does not tax the future reader of the code.p  pEven if the codenew Mapcode syntax is changed to codeMap.getinstancecode, my argument was that using the singleton will actually lead to more work later, should we choose to someday allow multiple maps, because the code written around the singleton will actually behave as though its important it work on a particular map, rather than perhaps create a new map and operate on emitem. In other words, Im wondering if a good test for whether or not to use a singleton is if the code surrounding it seems agnostic of whether its operating on a real new object or an existing object. The canonical example of a database connection, for instance, passes this test.p  pI know thats not much information, but... well thats why making coding standards is hard its tough to make those decisions without perfect information.  But lets say you were designing Google Maps from scratch today and had that decision to make. I also know its a ridiculously small point but for some reason I intuitively strongly prefer my version and Im trying to understand just why.  p  pWhich do you choose and whyp

Negative 6250 pIm trying to figure out if theres a better way to structure some code. Although it currently works, it always gets at me due to the complexity and crazy nature that it feels to have with generics constraints. Id be interested to know if anyone has an idea for a neater solution.p  pIve included a class diagram to make things a little easier.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE8krK.png altenter image description herep  pThis is all going within a library, and I wanted to try and keep all my type safety where I can. The library has 3 layers of increasing complexity. Which Ill explain in a moment.p  pIm using Generics to make all the types work. For example a Route is actually a codeListltTgtcode where codeTcode is a Visit. Now because Ive got the 3 layers, I want to be able to access properties on these Visits and the Nodes that they correspond to from the Route itself and to make it easier to consume. So that actually makes a codeRouteltVisitltNodegtgtcode. Once you add that to a Solution which needs to be strongly typed codeSolutionltRouteltVisitltNodegtgtgtcode things get complicated.p  pThis results in some kinda unslightly codep  precodepublic abstract class SolutionltTSolution, TRoute, TVisit, TNode, TResourcegt    where TSolution  SolutionltTSolution, TRoute, TVisit, TNode, TResourcegt, new    where TRoute  RouteltTRoute, TVisit, TNode, TResourcegt, new    where TVisit  VisitltTVisit, TNodegt, new    where TNode  ElementltTNodegt    where TResource  ResourceltTResourcegt codepre  pIt all works nicely, but I have to define these constraints at each classlevel. At each level of complexity I create some simple consumable class such as the following, essentially hiding the generic constraints which would make it impossible to consume.p  precodeLevel1.Solution  Common.SolutionltSolution, Route, Visit, Node, Resourcegt codepre  pThey have also been made recursive based on advice from this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3626937howtouseinheritancewhenusinggenericconstraintsquestiona to allow me to extend the class. For example a Level2.Solution will needs to be able to specify a Level2.Route as one of the constraints, normally this wont work cocontra variance and generics without the recursion.p  pAll in all, it works, but is a bit cringy to say the least. Anyone have any ideas how this can be reworked nicelyp

Negative 6250 pis it possible to use the .NET Introspection functionality in unit tests In our software Id like to prohibit usage of some operations comparison of enum values since there as a special method for that purpose. I remember that FxCop Static Code Analysis ofers access to the code model by means of Introspection. With it, you can inspect whether some function is used or not.

Negative 6250 pI am wondering how I can speedup my unit tests.  I am using JUnit and before each test I am dropping the database schema and then recreating it.  Since my schema is somewhat large, this can take quite a long time considering I have over 1000 tests.p  pTo give you an understanding of my setup   Spring 3 hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean which is using the HSQL dialect.   I am using the JUnits Suite runner to run a list of classes.  p  pI noticed that Spring has a SpringJunit4ClassRunner that understands Transaction annotation, but not the suite annotations.  I got around this issue and now rollbacks are being attempted, but they seem to cause an infinite recursion which leads to a StackOverflow.p  pIm relatively new to Spring and all its magic, but I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas in regard to the StackOverflow, or any other ideas in speeding up the testingp  pMaybe I could write to a file the clean state of the DB and continuously reload that after each test, though Im not sure if this is possible.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 6250 pHere are the brief definitions of encapsulation and abstraction.p  pAbstractionp  blockquote   pThe process of abstraction in Java is used to hide certain details and   only show the essential features of the object. In other words,                 it deals with the outside view of an object interface.  The only good example i see for this  across different sites is   interface.p blockquote  pEncapsulationp  blockquote   pIts basically about hiding the state of object with the help of   modifiers like private,public,protected etc. we expose the state thru   public methods only if require.p blockquote  pWhat we achieve with modifiers like codeprivatecode, codepubliccode also hides unnecessary details from out side world which is nothing but also a abstraction conceptp  pSo, from above explanation looks like encapsulation is a part of abstraction or we can say its a subset of abstraction. But why then encapsulation term is invented when we could deal it with abstraction only I am sure there should be some major difference which distinguishes them but most of material on net says almost same thing for both of them.p  pThough this question has been raised on this forum earlier too but I am posting it again with specific doubts. Some replies also says abstraction is a concept and encapsulation is implementation. But I dont buy this  If it is true, then I can think these two different concepts are provided to confuse us.p

Negative 6250 pIm using a codeHorizontalScrollViewcode in one of my layouts and replaced the scroll bar track and the thumb by overriding the according xml attributes, so that the track represents thumbnails of the views within the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode and the thumb indicates the current position.p  pThis works fine so far and I can scroll within the view. However, I cannot use the scroll bar, i.e. the track and the thumb for scrolling, I can only scroll via flings on top of the whole view. Every clickfling on top of the scroll bar is simply interpreted like a clickfling elsewhere in the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode. In other words, I cant drag the thumb and thereby change the position, nor can I jump to a certain position by clicking somewhere on the scroll bar track. p  pHere is my layoutp  precodeltHorizontalScrollView xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidscrollbarFadeDuration0 androidscrollbarThumbHorizontaldrawablehighlightbox androidscrollbarTrackHorizontaldrawabletumbnailchain gt      ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidorientationhorizontal gt         ...couple of FrameLayouts      ltLinearLayoutgt  ltHorizontalScrollViewgt codepre  pUnfortunately I couldnt find any solution to this problem yetp  pEDITbr I just found out that the scroll bar is not supposed to work this way in Android, see a hrefhttpgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthreadbec4353a864bdfbd relnofollowhereap  pDoes anyone have an idea, how I could implement the desired behaviour explained above No code needed, just suggestionsp  pEDIT 2 Workaroundbr To the ones who are interested in my solution I put a transparent dummy view on top of the scrollbar of the same size and set an codeOnTouchListenercode to this view. In the codeonTouchcode method of the listener I then calculate the relative position of the touch event as far as the track bar is concerned and then jump to the same relative position within the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode via the codescrollTocode method  p  precodepublic boolean onTouch View v, MotionEvent event      int x  Math.roundevent.getX  mScrollbarWidth  mScrollViewWidth     mScrollView.scrollTox, 0     return true  codepre  pwhere mScrollBarWidth is the width of the scrollbar essentially the screen width and mScrollViewWidth is the width of the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode in total. Since this method is called continuously during touching the dummy view, you can not only jump to the position you touched, you can also drag the thumb on the scrollbar.p

Negative 6250 pIve written the following jQuery script, and Im trying to make a cool transition, lol. When you start typing in postareainput input typetextbox, the page should switch to the compose.php page a form, while you type, and if you type over 19 characters, the textbox should expand to 80 width on keyup, if its less than 30 characters, the box reverts to 300px. p  pThough, the problem is, if you blur out of the postareainput textbox, and then focus again, the load function reloads, and the other possibly inputted data in the compose.php file will be gone.p  pThe question is How do I make it so I prevent the last function from occurring again once its already occurred Ive looked at .unbind, but seeing as though theres another function being simultaneously on the same ID, that would disable the expanding function as well.p  pThanks a lot Very grateful for any answers  The script is belowp  precodepostareainput.keyupfunction     ifpostareainput.val.length gt 19         postareainput.animatewidth 80,, 80, function          else          postareainput.animatewidth 300,, 80, function        postareainput.blurfunction     ifpostareainput.val.length lt 19         postareainput.animatewidth 300,, 80, function        postareainput.keyupfunction     pcontent.loadcompose.php.hide.fadeInslow  codepre  pCheers Karanp

Negative 6250 pI have one form FormPrincipal.csp  pIn this form there is a public method called InsertionSort taking 2 parameters a strongint[]strong representing a integer list and a strongintstrong represeting the size number of elements of the list.

What Im doing wrong The code is like the followingp  precode [TestMethod]     public void InsertionSortTest              FormPrincipal target  new FormPrincipalltsome parametersgt         target.loadData  function which load the list to be ordered         int[] list1  new int[10]         list1  1,4,3,5,2,6,7,9,8,0         target.InsertionSortlist1,10         bool listaOrderedOrNot  isListOrderedlist1, 10  isListOrder is just a function in the same file of the test where I loop the array checking if elements are growing.         Assert.InconclusiveA method that does not return a value cannot be verified.          I tried to do the following assert command..         Assert.AreEquallistaOrderedOrNot, true,ordered         Assert.IsTruelistaOrderedOrNot, ordered         Assert.IsFalselistaOrdenadaOrNot, NOT ordered      codepre  pI suppose it may depends from the fact InsertionSort doesnt return anything but Visual Studio doesnt give errors and no message for example ordered or NOT ordered is printed.p  pThe test just fails when I run itp  pThank you for any helpp

Negative 6250 pI am part of an Agile scrum team working on a software product release. The sprint duration is 2 weeks 10 days.p  pThere is a peculiar metric used here, called strongmidsprint acceptancestrong. Essentially, the expectation is that half the userstory points committed and planned by a scrum team in a sprint needs to be completed by the middle of that sprint. This, they say, results in a linear burndown of points which is a strong indicator that the sprint is going on well.p  pAs a team, our midsprint acceptances are usually bad, but we are known to complete all the committed userstory points by the end of the sprint.p  pI have the following questionsp  p1 Is midsprint acceptance a valid AgileSCRUM practice Is it being used anywhere elsep  p2 Expecting half of the work to be completed in half the time is akin to treating it as a factoryfloor job, where the nature and complexity of the work at hand is completely deterministic. Since software development is a creative process, such rigid metrics in a highly flexible methodology such as Agile is irrelevant. What do you thinkp  p3 Although my scrum team completes all our commitments just in time for the sprint, we are being questioned for our bad midsprint acceptance metrics. Is it completely normal in scrum teams everywhere else to meet their commitments only towards the end of their sprintsp  pMuch thanks in advance.p

I want to create a single edge, with a bothdirected arrow, but dont know how to do it right.

Negative 6250 pI have a MVC4 application that is calling Amazon Web Services. The amazon service client is implemented in a separate assembly. So architecture is like MVC4  WCF Client Assembly  AmazonWebServicep  pThis arrangement is working perfectly if i replace MVC4 web application with ASP.Net or a console application. but when I an using MVC4 application, the request is not returning any response. It just looks like response from web service is just the request itself. I am not getting any results from amazon web service. Is there something i am missing in MVC4 configuration file or some route needs to be added or things like that. p  pAny hint will be appreciated.p

Negative 6250 pI have the following simplified scenario.p  pThere is a WCF service MyService, which exposes some entity MyEntityDTO. On the client side, I have created an interface IMyServiceClient which is being passed to my clientside components, so they can request MyEntityDTOs from any underlying implementation. And also now I can run clientside unit tests using some MockedMyServiceClient  IMyServiceClient. Seems good so far.p  pNow I have created an actual MyRealWCFServiceClient  IMyServiceClient, which essentially just wraps around the WCF service reference created by Visual Studio.p  pOne issue is that WCF service reference returns a completely another kind of MyEntityDTO, so I have to map it from the service reference entity type to MyEntityDTO type which is returned from IMyServiceClient. I can use AutoMapper for this.p  pBut here comes the biggest issue. Lets say, I want to reuse my MyRealWCFServiceClient in some other applications in my project. If each of these applications will have its own WCF service reference with its own DTO types, Ill have to somehow pass all the DTO types of the current service reference and configure AutoMapper with some tricky Reflection to inject my Generic types into it. What a mess...p  pBut I could collect my common WCF references with their wrapping MyRealWCFServiceClients in some common library, so all MyRealWCFServiceClients use only those known common WCF references.   p  pI wonder, is it a good practice to create a common library for service references Is there a better solution for thisp
Negative 6250 pI have an interface which implementing classes export via MEF in my application. The implementing classes are in separate assemblies and arent known about at compiletime think plugins.p  pThe interface basically consists of a call which says here is a bunch of keyvalue pairs, now initialise your licensing state. I.e.p  pcodepublic LicensingInfo InitialiseLicenseIEnumerableltKeyValuePairltstring, stringgtgt keyscodep  pWhat I would like to know is  is there any way of protecting that interface from a middle man implementation I.e. one that receives the call from my application, then calls the same method on the plugin assembly with a different bunch of keyvalue pairs, basically saying yes  here you go  have everything.p  pI did try and think of it a different way, in that the application would call the plugin assembly and pass in an object which could be queried. That method might look something like thisp  pcodepublic LicensingInfo InitialiseLicenseILicenseQueryProvider providercodep  pHowever, again with this method I think that an intercepting object could just simply give a different provider to the library. p  pSo, is there a way I could prevent such interface interception, or should I refactor it such that the plugin assembly is entirely responsible for licence loading etc within its own code Or is there another way, perhaps, that I could refactor it that I havent consideredp

Negative 6250 h3The general goalh3  pSuppose for instance I want to develop a very pluggable issue tracker. Its core implementation might only support a ticket id and a description. Other extensions might add support for various other fields, yet those fields might exist in the database on the same table. Even if not, the number of queries to the database should not need to increase along with the number of extensions. They should be able to contribute to the definition of the query.p  pcodeItem[A, B, R[]]code would represent a column, with codeAcode for the table type has the column representations, codeBcode as the data type, and codeRcode as the type constructor representing a column of type codeBcode. So codeR[B]code might be ScalaQuerys codeNamedColumn[String]code, for example.p  pRight now Im trying to make a typeclass to handle building the query.p  h3The problemh3  pThe line starting with val q at the end should read simply codeval q  queryitemscode and still compile. Various attempts yield either an error that inferred type arguments dont conform to expected type arguments, due to codedefaultNextcode inferring codeB0code andor codeBcode to codeNothingcode, or a diverging implicit expansion error, or other errors. I think the implicit error is triggered by incorrect type inference though.p  pIve already wasted quite a few days on this its for an opensource project of mine so if someone could kindly help out I would really really appreciate it.p  precode  class CanBuildQuery[A, B, R[], Q, I lt Item[A, B, R]]val apply I gt A gt Q    trait Low      implicit def defaultNext[A, B, R[], B0, P lt Item[A, B0, R], I lt NextItem[A, B, B0, R, P], PQ]       implicit cbq CanBuildQuery[A, B0, R, PQ, P]      CanBuildQuery[A, B, R, PQ, R[B], I]        new CanBuildQuery[A, B, R, PQ, R[B], I]sys.errortodo       object CanBuildQuery extends Low      implicit def defaultFirst[A, B, R[]]       CanBuildQuery[A, B, R, R[B], FirstItem[A, B, R]]          new CanBuildQuery[A, B, R, R[B], FirstItem[A, B, R]].get       def query[A, B, R[], Q, I lt Item[A, B, R]]     i I with Item[A, B, R]        implicit cbq CanBuildQuery[A, B, R, Q, I]    A gt Q      cbq apply i    trait Item[A, B, R[]]          def get A gt R[B]          trait FirstItem[A, B, R[]] extends Item[A, B, R]          def get A gt R[B]          trait NextItem[A, B, B0, R[], I lt Item[A, B0, R]] extends Item[A, B, R]         val prev I     def get A gt R[B]       val items      new NextItem[Boolean, String, Long, Option, FirstItem[Boolean, Long, Option]]       val get   Boolean gt hello        val prev  new FirstItem[Boolean, Long, Option]          val get   Boolean gt 73                 val q  queryitemsCanBuildQuery.defaultNextCanBuildQuery.defaultFirst codepre

Having to have N1 dummy handlers ie, at any one time only one handler is being used and the others are just there doing nothing defined in the class screams confused and low cohesive object model but who knows.p

Negative 6250 pHeres the scenariop  pIm working with a database table that stores an XML string in one of its columns. This XML contains important data that I am working on generating reports on using Crystal Reports. To do this I have created an object to represent the relevant data from the XML string and bound a list of these objects to my report viewer. Ive done a bit of work with the Crystal Reports setting up filtering and sorting using their native controls but this is turning out to not be verbose enough to handle the kind of filtering I want to be capable of.p  pI would like to have some kind of UI control that would allow a user to build expressions which can be used to filter my list of objects. The list can then be programmatically bound to the reports viewer with the relevant objects.p  pFor clarification an example of something I would like to do. Have the user be able to select all transactions for a given product that happened between 9  10 AND 12  2 OR 4 5. Basically to be given querying control using logical operations for any of the properties in my object.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions on how to accomplish this Was wondering if anyone knew of any tools that contained this kind of functionality.p

Negative 6250 pI am using SVN as my source control repository and Jenkins as my CI tool.  I run MSBuild scripts using Jenkins to do the actual builds and deploys.  I also use the Jenkins Pipeline plugin to do manage the building of downstream projects.  p  pI have an issue with the pipeline.  The problem is that, say I have done 10 checkins into SVN and as a result 10 automatic CI builds have taken place, and as a result of that the pipeline shows 10 builds.  Now, if I want to push build number 5 to the next stage in the pipeline I would expect all the code up to the fifth build to be built to the next stage, instead what is happening is that the latest code build 10 is being used all the time.  p  pI dont know whether I need to modify my build script or whether I need to configure Jenkins or whether I need to configure the pipeline plugin.  Does anyone knowp  pJust in case you dont know what I mean by the pipeline plugin, here is a screenshot.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHG3zs.png altenter image description herep

Negative 6250 pIve come to use Eclipse to develop for Android on my Windows machine for quite some time now, but more and more Ive been booting up into my Ubuntu partition. I honestly love both operating systems as they both have their pros and cons, but I boot into each one randomly. Anyway, I have three partitions on my hard drive. One for Windows 8, one for Ubuntu, and one for shared data docs, pics, videos. But I would like to seamlessly develop on one OS and then on the other. So, my data partition should be able to hold my workspace, but I dont know if that will ruin or corrupt the .metadata and potentially ruin my projects.

This was very frustrating to me and it took me a while to dig out the setting, but it turned out that the solution is pretty simple  one code line change.p  pI wanted to post it for others, so they can adjust their lightbox size, and not go through the trouble I did.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  ol liOpen the file  codegalleryHelpersrcgalleria.jscodeli liFind this code line  codevar r  Math.min w60  lightbox.w, h80  lightbox.h codeli liChange it to this  codevar r  1codeli ol  pstrongNOTEstrong If you make this change, the lightbox size will be as big as the actual image size you are displaying. Think of this value 1, as equal to 100. Therefore if you would like the lightbox to be 1.5 times bigger than the actual image, set the value to 1.5. Conversely, if you would like it to display only 80 of the actual image size, set it to 0.8.p  pAlso, this code line is inside a section, which looks like thisp  precoderescale this.proxyfunctione                   var w  Math.min this.widthwindow, lightbox.w                  var h  Math.min this.heightwindow, lightbox.h                  var r  Math.min w60  lightbox.w, h80  lightbox.h                  var destW  lightbox.w  r  40                 var destH  lightbox.h  r  60 codepre  pYou can clearly see that a math formula is used to dynamically calculate the size for each image. If you would like a fixed lightbox size, then play with these values codevar destWcode, codevar destHcode.p  pEnjoyp

Negative 6250 pHy, Im having a hard time with media player in android. Basically i try to play a song from my sd card which is downloading some sort of streaming. So after the song was downloaded 20 the song start to play and if i leave it like this it work fine until the end, but if i try to seek at the end over 20 obviously it wont work because my seek position is over EOF file so i made this code inside a methodp  precode        MediaPlayer mp  new MediaPlayer         mp.setDataSourcesFilePath         mp.prepare         int offset  progress  mp.getDuration  100         if sCompleted return         sLastSeek  offset          if offset gt sMediaPlayer.getDuration              sMediaPlayer.reset             sMediaPlayer.setDataSourcesFilePath             sMediaPlayer.prepare         else             sMediaPlayer.seekTooffset         codepre  pWhere sMediaPlayer is my mediaPlayer, and sFilePath is file path. In theory the case i presented should be covered but when i seek over the file length the player is reseted as the code says but is not playing and this is very akward and is over my powersp  pIf you have any idea please share.

Negative 6250 pBelow is the set up of our projectp  ol liProject is a multi module maven projectli liMaven and tycho is used to build the pluginsli liJenkins is used as the CI server and run nightly builds.li liEach plugin manifest contains 1.0.0.qualifier as the version number. The qualifier tag is replaced by the time stamp after the build.li liGit as the version control systemli ol  pWith the above set up, when the nightly build runs, the plugins get a new version number, even though nothing has changed in the source code of the plugin.What this does is that it produces a lot of redundant versions of the plugin and it becomes a problem when we provide the output of the nightly builds as a update site. Eclipse unnecessarily downloads all the plugins in the update site because the time stamp has changed and it considers all of them as new versions even though nothing has changed in terms of functionality or content for most plugins from the previous versions.p  pBased on the above explanation, is there a way to prevent generation of new version of the plugins with the nightly builds, may be by configuration change in Jenkins or using a feature in tycho or in Maven etc. The version should be updated automatically with the nightly build  for the plugins that have changedeither source code or configurationp

This option will not work for me, as I need all the properties from all the tables and dont want to have to type out the same anonymous type 10 times  once for each variable. I want the compiler to infer that they are all the same type based on the fact that all properties are identical.p  pIve already tried casting to an IEnumberable, Iqueryable, Datatable etc. using both the AsQueryable type functions, and the as keyword. None of that seems to do the trick for me.p  pIm wondering if there is some way of doing this by casting dynamically to a parent type. I cant edit the initial declarations of the classes, so cant implement a common interface on them to cast to. But is there some way I can downcast the types into a common interface when they are used, without writing a conversion from each type to a parent interfacep  pThanks for any advicep

Negative 6250 pI have created an HTML book for a religious site I worked on. Now Im trying to optimize the site for mobiletablets. At the moment Im just trying to work out the iPhone display. Basically I have a codepositionfixedcode sidebar with a menu and codewidth250pxcode, also a main content codedivcode. When viewed on iPhone it looks fine, but the text is initially too small, when zoomed in, the sidebar encompasses too much of the screen, see imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com08iwz.png altzoomed iPhone viewportp  pAs you can see the sidebar overlaps the main content and continues too the more you zoom. I know I can set codeuserscalable  nocode but then the user cant read the content properly. Also tried media query but cant seem to get this right. Thank you for your time.p

Negative 6250 pI have been upgrading an already working project that depends on boost 1.43 to boost 1.52. When compiling, I receive a strange set of errors in the math special functions headers. Unfortunately, I am unable to pin point the code that is causing it from the output below. The math errors seem to pop out of nowhere as codeDisplayWindow.hcode and codeDisplayWindow.cppcode do not use these math functions. The compiler is gcc 4.1.2 on Linux. The same occurs on boost 1.51. Does anyone know what might be causing the problemp  pI am not sure if it matters  I am using boost as a TR1 dropin described over a

Negative 6250 pI created a custom control, which is simply three radio buttons, and an codeAnswercode property of type codestringcode that can be one of codeYescode, codeNocode, or codeNAcode.

Negative 6250 pI have a model with column codeamountcode which is a decimal in the database.

Negative 6250 pWe have created a self signed CA certificate which we use to sign other certificates for SSL purposes. These certificates will be installed in other servers which we do not have access to and will be strictly to communicate with other clients like mobile applications.p  pWhen these clients written in .NET make a request to the servers using HTTPS we get the Invalid certificate received from server error because the CA cert is not a trusted CA on that client.p  pWe want to bypass this security using the codeServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallbackcode, but only if the certificate being used was signed by our CA certificate. p  pI can check the codecertificate.Issuercode, but that can easily be spoofed by anyone.

Negative 6250 pI dont know if I should use opengl to make my game, or a game engine.

That is why I want to use opengl, so I will learn about graphics, the raster engine, etc. However, Ive been studying what opengl does a bit, and It seems like it abstracts many things for you, like the matrices that are used for rasterizing, back face culling, and more. p  pThe raster process was the thing that most intrigued me to use opengl, but since it seems that opengl abstracts this for you, should I just use a game engine instead of opengl p

Negative 6250 pHi i am trying to refresh a text in a page that informs about the state of the calculations on the server side, while they are being done. The calculations start with a get request and the refreshing has to happen only while the get has not completed. I am trying to do this by getting the contents of a text file on the server in setInterval and closing that set interval after the GET has been completed. My problem is that when i look at what is happening i only see one request for the text file, at the beginning, and then nothing. I would expect to see a request every 200ms from my code. I am attaching the js code and thanking u in advance.

Negative 6250 pPHP newbie here, struggling like crazy to get his head around how to go about implementing a HTTPREFERERbased security feature into my woefully inept downloads system.p  pBasically, I have it where my file download pages have a specific string appended to the end of the URL, this specific string beingp  precodethanks codepre  pIf that is visible in the URL, then users will be able to download the file situated on it. It works great, but its easy to unlock a page by simply adding the thanks part onto the URL themselves. Effectively allowing users to bypass my clumsy security and access my premium files with ease.p  pIf possible, Id like to add a security measure whereby anyone attempting to access a page containing the string thanks that did not previously arrive from a page containing pending be redirected to the homepage. That would make for the perfect solution for me.p  pJust for clarity, the typical predownload process goes like thisp  ul liUser visits download page [website]downloadpage123li liUser completes Recaptcha, gets redirected to here [website]downloadpage123pendingli liUser fills in details, gets redirected to here [website]downloadpage123thanksli liUser receives their fileli ul  pLongwinded, yes, but it would be more than ideal for my unusual requirements. I also know that users can likely get around this by first appending pending to the URL and then appending thanks afterwards, but it still really, really would help to no end.p  pSo, StackOverflow, can any of you wizened and kindly coders help a fledgling web designer out I thank you for any and all help.

Negative 6250 pI have looked into at least 6 different SQL Lua extensions, and they all seem to have their latest version compatible with up to version 5.1 of Lua. I have had zero success in implementing any of them into my current project which uses Lua 5.2, with the best case scenario ending in either silent program crashes or codeattempt to call global module a nil valuecode.br I am not the original project owner, so I am trying not to be forced into changing the source code for it emthough more recently, I have even gone down that road nowem.p  pAnd often times, it is unclear if these crashes are related to the way the project itself operates, the way the project implements Lua as a static library, the way that Lua tries to implement its extensions, the way the extensions implement their dependencies, a versioning conflict, or some sort of crazy combination of each. Its practically impossible to debug a silent crash in this manner, because the source of evil could literally be anything.p  pAs the answer states a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16849422in this questiona, I have even tried supporting the emmoduleem function emwhich most lua sql extensions utilize, but was deprecated in 5.2em, but the program still crashes or just complains about a seemingly infinite amount of missing dependencies. And after spending hours of tracking down emwhat would seem to beem all of the dependencies it would complain about, it strongemstillemstrong crashes.brp  pChanging the projects source code to use the Lua 5.1 source appears to break the functionality of the project, resulting in various compiler errors regarding missing 5.2related functions. Linking the a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdownloadsconnectorc relnofollowMySQL CC connectora to the project results in rather vague runtime errors, which seem to conflict with the way the project implements Lua 5.2.p  pemstrongAre there ANYemstrong sqliteMySQL extensions out there which actually work with Lua 5.2 on a 32bit Windows machine Preferably, outofthebox precompiled binaries with Lua sourceffi bindingsbr strongemOR alternativelyemstrong, are there any clear instructions on how to get this set up properly, without having to scavenge through separate instructions across the web for each required assemblyp

Negative 6250 pIm currently learning Backbone.js so apologies if this is a silly question whilst creating a small hangman game.p  pIve successfully created the game which allows the player to play, get a score and restart the game after winninglosing however my question is in regards to implementing an initial menu screen and navigating to the game or options pages etc.p  pWhat is the best way to accomplish this, is it by simply showing the menu, then when the user clicks to play, hiding or clearing the DOM elements of the menu page and initialising the game views which will display the game page Then, when the user returns to the menu doing the same thing, clearing the game views and showing the menu.p  pSorry for my simplistic question and I hope I have explained myself well enough. I have searched around and looked through several tutorials in hope of finding an answer but nothing seems to address the problem Im facing.p  pThanksp

Negative 6250 pI will preface this with me scouring for an answer, and finding similar questions here, but have not found one that works in my case. p  pI am trying to create a Simon Saysesque Android game in Eclipse, and I have created a method to choose a random color adding to an arraylist of previous chosen colors. The array would looks like Blue, Green, Yellow, etc. Once the color is added, I want to be able to loop through the table and flash the respective button to signify that is the correct answer. For example, if the chosen colors are blue, green, and yellow, it would dop  pemflash blueemp  pemflash greenemp  pemflash yellowemp  pflashing would just be changing the ImageButtons backgroundp  pHowever, I want to be able to delay the flashing of upcoming colors, as without delay, I wouldnt be able to tell what flashed, as all of them would flash instantaneously. Is there anyway to do what Im describing Ive tried thread.Sleep, and I dont think thats what I want as it freezes the screen.

Negative 6250 pI am working on an iOS test application to work with a Bluetooth 4.0 LE module I have developed. The module acts as a wireless UART connection to other electronic devices. I need to send an array of binary bytes through the peripheral. My setup already uses NSdata and transmits that via Bluetooth to the module. p  pSay for example I have an NSString ABCDE then the string is converted into NSdata and transmitted, it arrives in my module as ABCDE works great, no problems. p  pHowever for one of my main applications I need to convert the charecters of the string into a proprietary byte array using a look up table. Then this byte array needs to become the NSdata and be transmitted. p  pHere is an example p  pLet say I have the codestring Acode a look up function determines each A becomes 5 binary bytes code0111111 1001000 100100 0111111 0000000code All letters consist of 5 bytes of binary data. p  pNow I need to store that in the NSData object so that it is sent through Bluetooth. The problem I am running into is that if I use the string representation of that data I will end up with a data object that is incorrect. I have tried many things but nothing seems to be working. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 6250 pI am writing a system where I have multiple inputs. If the first one doesnt pass the validation test, I want the next field to be saved if it does pass. However, at the moment, if the first one doesnt pass the validation test, everything fails and nothing is saved. So I thought of creating individual ones. I know that you can make individual groups in the config area. However, it seems that the rulesgroups you make in the config for validation testing are predefined fields. They are never dynamically created.p  pIs this possiblep

Negative 6250 pI am trying to learn C and came across this problem statementp  h2CHALLENGE DESCRIPTIONh2  pemOur marketing department has just negotiated a deal with several local merchants that will allow us to offer exclusive discounts on various products to our top customers every day. The catch is that we can only offer each product to one customer and we may only offer one product to each customer.emp  pemEach day we will get the list of products that are eligible for these special discounts. We then have to decide which products to offer to which of our customers. Fortunately, our team of highly skilled statisticians has developed an amazing mathematical model for determining how likely a given customer is to buy an offered product by calculating what we call the suitability score SS. The topsecret algorithm to calculate the SS between a customer and a product is thisemp  pem1. If the number of letters in the products name is even then the SS is the number of vowels a, e, i, o, u, y in the customers name multiplied by 1.5.br 2. If the number of letters in the products name is odd then the SS is the number of consonants in the customers name.br 3. If the number of letters in the products name shares any common factors besides 1 with the number of letters in the customers name then the SS is multiplied by 1.5.emp  pemYour task is to implement a program that assigns each customer a product to be offered in a way that maximizes the combined total SS across all of the chosen offers. Note that there may be a different number of products and customers. You may include code from external libraries as long as you cite the source.emp  h2INPUT SAMPLEh2  pemYour program should accept as its only argument a path to a file. Each line in this file is one test case. Each test case will be a comma delimited set of customer names followed by a semicolon and then a comma delimited set of product names.

Negative 6250 pI am making an area calculator to help me understand the basics of Python, but I want to do some type of validation on it  if a length is less than zero, then ask again. Ive managed to do this with the validation code inside the function for the shape e.g. inside the square function but when I put the validation code in a separate function  negativeLength, it doesnt work. This is my code in the separate functionp  precodedef negativeLengthwhichOne     while whichOne lt 1         whichOne  intinputPlease enter a valid length codepre  pWhen I run this by calling negativeLengthLength it will ask me for the length again as it should but when I enter the positive length, the condition is met and so the actual loop does not run.p  pI have also tried after following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions743164dowhileloopinpythondowhile loop in Pythonap  precodedef negativeLengthwhichOne     while True         whichOne  intinputPlease enter a valid length         if whichOne lt 1             break codepre  p... but that doesnt work either.p  pIve put the parameter as whichOne because the circles length is called Radius, so Id call it as negativeLengthRadius instead of negativeLengthLength for a square.p  pSo is there any way to make the while loop finish after the whichOne  intinput...p  pEdit Im using Python 3.3.3p

Negative 6250 pIm trying to decide on terms to use when describing a function like codex  ycode ie codex  x  ycode.p  p First Question does anyone know of a good way to refer to the LHS term x.

The best alternative I can think of at present is codemodcode or codemodifycode for the modified variable.p  p Second Question If the function isnt actually an operator, what do I call it Is compound the correct word Compound function has a different meaning  basically a nested function.p

Negative 6250 pIve searched and cant find a problem similar to mine, where its partially responsive.  I have a footer with 3 buttons and a search box.

But the search box is aligning to the left instead of centering with the buttons.

As you can see, it has an ngshow tag with an isValid value defined. This value is unnecessary because the value of the controls validity can be obtained via the parent custom directives container and I do this. This is not working and I dont know how to make it work since upon creation of the controller, it has to be defined somewhere. If I create a scope with it with 2 way binding, angular throws an exception. p  pSo the question is how can I make this work without forcing the user to create an unnecessary attributep
Negative 6250 pHow are extremely large floating point numbers represented in memory I would imagine that if  for instance you wanted to compute Pi or Eulers constant to say, 2,000,000 digits that you would allocate a massive array of bytes for the digits to the right of the decimal place. Each byte would store 2 decimal place values and the array would be a member of a data structure with the number of digits and number of bytes used to store the value. Is this how it worksp
Negative 6250 pI am trying to reverse engineer a 16 bit checksum algorithm of one relatively old 10 years LAN game that is no longer supported nor has source code available.

Negative 6250 pIn many places Java utilizes the approach to have both, for example, codeCollectioncode and codeCollectionscode class.p  pcodeCollectioncode is interface, it defined some methods. codeCollectionscode class also provide some method.  Why didnt they choose to place all methods inside the interfacep  pbecause the names are too puzzled word. codeCollectioncode is like codeCollectionscode. I know the historical reason. like codeinterruptcode and codeinterruptedcode , because java must fit to old version, the methods names are likely, make developer difficult to write and read.

Negative 6250 pIm trying to improve the performance of a script when executed in a web worker. Its designed to parse large text files in the browser without crashing. Everything works pretty well, but I notice a severe difference in performance for large files when using a web worker.p  pSo I conducted a simple experiment. I ran the script on the same input twice. The first run executed the script in the main thread of the page no web workers. Naturally, this causes the page to freeze and become unresponsive. For the second run, I executed the script in a web worker.p  ul lia hrefhttpsgithub.commholtjquery.parseblobversion3papaparse.jsScript being executedali lia hrefhttpsgithub.commholtjquery.parsetreeversion3playerTest runner pageali ul  pFor small files in this experiment lt 100 MB, the performance difference is negligible. However, on large files, parsing takes about 20x longer in the worker threadp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOJUIv.png altPerformance of both scenarios on same graphp  pThe blue line is expected. It should only take about 11 seconds to parse the file, and the performance is fairly steadyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXjBvZ.png altPerformance of script without web workerp  pThe red line is the performance inside the web worker. It is much more surprisingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commuSha.png altPerformance of script in web workerp  pThe jagged line for the first 30 seconds is normal the jag is caused by the slight delay in sending the results to the main thread after every chunk of the file is parsed. However, parsing slows down rather abruptly at 30 seconds. Note that Im only ever using a single web worker for the job never more than one worker thread at a time.p  pIve confirmed that the delay is emnotem in sending the results to the main thread with codepostMessagecode. The slowdown is in a hrefhttpsgithub.commholtjquery.parseblobversion3papaparse.jsL873the tight loopa of the parser, which is entirely synchronous. For reasons I cant explain, that loop is drastically slowed down and it gets slower with time after 30 seconds.p  pBut this only happens in a web worker. Running the same code in the main thread, as youve seen above, runs very smoothly and quickly.p  pWhy is this happening What can I do to improve performance I dont expect anyone to fully understand all 1,200 lines of code in that file. If you do, thats awesome, but I get the feeling this is more related to web workers than my code, since it runs fine in the main thread.p  pemSystem Im running Chrome 35 on Mac OS 10.9.4 with 16 GB memory quadcore 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 with 256 KB L2 cache per core and L3 Cache of 6 MB. The file chunks are about 10 MB in size.emp  pstrongUpdatestrong Just tried it on Firefox 30 and it did emnotem experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than Chrome when run in the main thread. However, trying the same experiment with an even larger file about 1 GB yielded significant slowdown after about 3540 seconds it seems.p

Negative 6250 pI have a site built in PHP that basically outputs data from an oracle db. Same page on the same day can open fast 12 seconds and then 5 minutes later can load a bit slow. Not super slow, something like 20  30 seconds, but for a user switching quickly from page to page its a bit of an overhead.p  pSame query if ran in Golden can run first time about 4  6 seconds but each consequent time will run under one second. Query uses 3 joined views i created. Each view has approximately 4000 rows however its pulling data from joined tables that are in excess of 200300K rows.p  pEach view run separately in Golden will run first time for about 1.1 1.7 seconds.p  pI dont understand why its happening Is there a way to speed up the site I am trying to read about optimizing but its so complicated for me i am still a very beginner. I read about materialized views  but i dont think it can work for me since we constantly update records.

Negative 6250 pThis is my actual querybr emselect id,nameen,namefr from stores where nameen like l or descriptionen like l order by nameenemp  pIt is giving proper result in sqlite browser. FYI Slight changed query to post herep  pBut our sqlite3 API function codesqlite3preparev2code only accepts strongSQL statement, UTF8 encodedstrong. So, I should have to convert above query string to UTF8 character pointer. p  pI tried to achieve it by following code,p  precodeconst char  queryPointer  [finalQuery UTF8String] int resultCode  sqlite3preparev2database, queryPointer, 1, ampcompileStatement, NULL codepre  pbut It is giving empty result set. After looked into codequeryPointercode I found that strongstrong in my query string is replaced by some unwanted characters. So, I think problem lies here. I believe this is something related to encoding. p  pI have tried several combination of encoding, below is one of themp  precodeNSData dataOfParam1  [sqlStatement dataUsingEncodingNSISOLatin1StringEncoding] NSString unicodeStr1  [[NSString alloc] initWithDatadataOfParam1 encodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] const char unichar2  [unicodeStr1 cStringUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] codepre  pMight be I am in wrong direction so, other work arounds are also accepted.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pActually, codefinalQuerycode is static search query except stronglstrong, it is a search term.p  pstrongSecond Editstrongp  pOne interesting thing I found is if we are searching strongLEstrong Please note case differencethen search is working and I am getting result. but I am astonished why this is case sensitive Same thing is working in emSqliteManagerem plugin of firefox without problem of case sensitivity. p

Negative 6250 pMy system is Win 8.1 64bit and using VS2013 Express. I can verify my video cards support the latest OpenGL and OpenCL. I used the latest code and media files from authors github and site a hrefhttpsgithub.comopenglsuperbiblesb6code relnofollowhttpsgithub.comopenglsuperbiblesb6codea and a hrefhttpwww.openglsuperbible.comexamplecode relnofollowhttpwww.openglsuperbible.comexamplecodea respectively.p  pI am able to make debug and release builds of the projects successfully but cannot correctly run it either via debug mode or the .exe in the bin folder. A white window will show up and then exit. I was able to step through and found that glfwOpenWindow will return false causing the exit but I cannot step further and see why it is returning so. I found some solutions that suggested changing p  precodeglfwOpenWindowHintGLFWOPENGLPROFILE, GLFWOPENGLCOREPROFILE codepre  ptop  precodeglfwOpenWindowHintGLFWOPENGLPROFILE, 0 codepre  pbut this does not change my results. I can verify also that major version is 4 and minor is 3 for the book code. I have found a few other people having the same problem but no resolution. Another possible solution but to a different problem it seems was changing the project subsystem to Console from Windows but this throws an error regarding main and so it may not be what Im looking for.p  pFor reference, this book is using glfw version 2.7.6 when currently the latest is 3.0.4. I tried swapping this too but it understandably blew up due to all of the changes. p  pAny further ideas would be great and very helpfulp

I think the problem is that maybe Parambyname doesnt work for this type of argument, its normally used like p  precode    SELECT  FROM myschema.mytable WHERE myfield  myparameter codepre  pie the colon comes after an  which isnt the case with the copy command. Any suggestions welcome.

Negative 6250 pThis has been talked about before but I have yet to come across a clear answer, its just roughly described as fire and water and left at that from my research.p  pRelational and None Relational databases are very different, but they both pull data, for my project I plan to use a None Relational database, however this will be installed in many places and some only have access to MySQL then later moved.p  pSo is it possible to force MySQL into a kind of None Relational mode I have used a schema that sort of mimics it but it still holds aspects of a relational database that so far I have not been able to overcome overly dependent on IDs and such, leading to syntaxdata structure being messy.p  pSo is there a magic library that will do thisp  pHere is a rough outline of my database schemap  p1 table is meta it contains and id, along with type and date and such, commonly searched fields that are universal basically.p  p1 table that contains data this has multiple rows for each column. It cannot be done through a join so its 2 queries to get the data.p  precodeCREATE TABLE meta    id int11 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   type varchar255 NOT NULL,   state tinyint3 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   created datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT 00000000 000000,    PRIMARY KEY  id  ENGINEInnoDB AUTOINCREMENT0 DEFAULT CHARSETutf8  CREATE TABLE data    id int11 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   metaid int11 unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   index varchar255 NOT NULL,   value longtext NOT NULL,    PRIMARY KEY  id  ENGINEInnoDB AUTOINCREMENT0 DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pAs you can see not easily searchable unless its by iddate or something, it also requires PHP to take up a lot of the slack for ordering and such. Not what I am really worried about though but to do an actual search it would need to dump the entire database and chew through it.....p  pstrongWhat kind of MySQL schema or concept could best replicate a None Relational model and still handle search reasonablystrongp

In a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma212505032073248thisa answer a hrefhttpsgithub.comJakeWharton relnofollowJakeWhartona one of the devs of codeRetrofitcode says that codeRestAdaptercode should be treated as a singleton.

The readstream that is created by spawn stops outputting any data. There are no errors, or anything as far as I can see.p  pIf I do ps x  grep curl to see what is happening, I can see that process id is changing at first, but then it just seems to halt at a certain point and never starts again. The process just hangs. Manually killing this process doesnt let the next one begin. Also, the process that relates to my bash script is still present, again, killing that makes no difference.p  pObservations and things Ive ruled outp  ul liUsing minimal resourcesli lirunning the generated bash script on the terminal works fineli lidoesnt seem to matter which URL I am curling i.e. its not my applicationli ul  pI feel like there is something daft I am missing, but I didnt know what to Google to figure it outp  pI was just hoping to run this file as if I was on the terminal, but it appears Node places some kind of restriction to stop it running out of control.

Seems simple enough, but Im receiving a sigsegv when I try to break out of my second while loop which skips over the data I dont care about.p  pWithout the break the code behaves as I would expect it to although not my desired output.

Negative 6250 pIm trying to figure out if there is a way to rename Pandas columns when you try to reset the index.

I realize I could always just rename the columns in the next line but was hoping thered be a cleaner way to do it in one line.p  pThanks Samp

Negative 6250 pI have 2 codeUILabelscode within a fixedheight cell. Both labels are multiline and I need to compress both labels vertically for the case the text wont fit within the cell. I have set slightly higher priority on the first label, as the text is more important there and I have defined vertical space constraints and different compression resistant priorities.p  pBoth labels now successfully adjusts its height for the cell and the second label truncates tail in case the text is too long, but in case there is too much text in both labels, the first label takes priority and compresses the second label so the text is either cut, or the label disappears. How should I configure the AutoLayout so that at least a single line of the second label is always visiblep

Negative 6250 pIm watching through the WWDC talks on AutoLayout, and Ive learned that having StoryboardID set on your views makes the console output for constraint conflicts much easier to read i.e. you get a name instead of just an address. They show you where to set the StoryboardID formerly just Identifier in Interface Builder, but is there a way to do it in code Im trying to debug a large and complicated set of views that I didnt write myself, in an app thats 100 programmatic, that has many unsatisfiable constraints, and that was somehow working in iOS 7 but started breaking in iOS 8. I would love to get a clear picture of which codeltUIView0x8675309gtcode is actually causing the problem.p  pI looked over the UIView class reference, no Identifier or StoryboardID to be found.p  pWouldnt be too surprised if the answer is nope. After all its called a Storyboard ID for a reason. But I would appreciate a confirmation, and a workaround to make the AutoLayout console dump more readable if possible.p

Ive even merged the payments to a continuous date vector and am still having the same issue, namely with frequency, periodicity, or order.by.p  precodeCTSdateV lt data.frameDate  seqas.Date20000701, as.Date20141231, days expd lt mergeexp, CTSdateV, byDate, all.y  T expdAmount[is.naexpdAmount] lt 0  headexpd[,cAmount,Date],20       Amount       Date 1        0.0 20000701 2        0.0 20000702 3        0.0 20000703 4        0.0 20000704 5   269909.4 20000705 6   130021.9 20000706 7  1454135.3 20000706 8   140065.5 20000707 9        0.0 20000708 10       0.0 20000709 11       0.0 20000710 12  274147.2 20000711 13  106959.2 20000711 14  119208.6 20000712 15       0.0 20000713 16       0.0 20000714 17       0.0 20000715 18  125402.5 20000716 19 1170603.1 20000716 20 1908463.3 20000716 codepre  pMost of the forecasting packages I am familiar with as well as any of the questions I have found asked so far on SO like fpp, forecasting, timeSeries, tseries, xts, and  the like require a much more orderly Date feature to codeorder.bycode or some other such concern.  p  pMy concern is over the appropriateness of the R package, not the statistical method.

of mine that only use objectivec and they were able to run fine in Xcode 6.3 so I believe this is either a swift error or something wrong with the settings in my project.p  pDoes anyone know what

Negative 6250 pI have the following base template class.p  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class Base    public     void dosomething        codepre  pIt is intended to be used as a emcuriously recurring template patternem. It should be inherited like codeclass B  public BaseltBgtcode. It must emnotem be inherited like codeclass B  public BaseltSomeoneElsegtcode. I want to statically enforce this requirement. If someone uses this wrong, I expect an error in the compiling phase.p  pWhat Im doing is putting a codestaticcastltT constampgtthiscode in codedosomethingcode. This way the class inheriting the template is or inherits from the class provided as the template parameter. Sorry for the confusing expression. In plain English, it requires codeBcode is or inherits from codeSomeoneElsecode in codeclass B  public BaseltSomeoneElsegtcode.p  pI dont know if its the optimal way to achieve this. Looks gross to me.p  pHowever I want to do more. I want to ensure codeBcode is codeSomeoneElsecode itself. How can I do thatp
Negative 6250 pAlmost every MVVM example Ive come across has both the Model and ViewModel implementing INotifyPropertyChanged.p  pOther sources ones which focus on domain modeling seem to suggest that Models should be incredibly plain something to do with separation of concerns with essentially no references to anything. Unfortunately, those sources dont use MVVM. p  pIm trying to reconcile the two.p  pIm relatively new to programming and completely new to design patterns and the like so please try to go easy on me.p  pstrongEditstrong Let me rephrase my question. Given that the answer to the above seems to be sometimes one and sometimes the other, strongWHENstrong should you do one and and when should you do the other. Also, how would each be implementedp  pThat isnt answered in the other post. It just has them arguing with each other.p

Negative 6250 pIm building an interactive floor. The main idea is to match the detections made with a Xtion camera with objects I draw in a floor projection and have them following the person.p  pI also detect the projection area on the floor which translates to a polygon. the camera can detect outside the screen area.p  pThe problem is that the algorithm detects the the top most part of the person under it using depth data and because of the angle between that point and the camera that point isnt directly above the persons feet.p  pI know the distance to the floor and the height of the person detected. And I know that the camera is not perpendicular to the floor but I dont know the cameras tilt angle.p  pMy question is how can I project that 3D point onto the polygon on the floorp  pIm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Ive been reading about camera projections but Im not seeing how to use it in this particular problem.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWith the awnser from Diego O.d.L I was able to get an almost perfect detection. Ill write the steps I used for those who might be looking for the same solution I wont get into much detail on how detection is madep  pStep 1  Calibrationp  ul lipHere I get some color and depth frames from the camera, using openNI, with the projection area cleared. pli lipThe projection area is detected on the color frames. pli lipI then convert the detection points to real world coordinates using OpenNIs codeCoordinateConvertercode. With the new real world detection points I look for the plane that better fits them.pli ul  pStep 2 Detectionp  ul lipI use the detection algorithm to get new person detections and to track them using the depth frames.pli lipThese detection points are converted to real world coordinates and projected to the plane previously computed. This corrects the offset between the persons height and the floor.pli liThe points are mapped to screen coordinates using a perspective transform.li ul  pHope this helps. Thank you again for the awnsers. p

Negative 6250 pI am running this code to try to let users select the size of a table  matrix. Users can click in a table to select the size of the matrix. However, Im getting an error for when I try to access codeonclickcode of one of the codelttdgtcode elements.p  pSpecifically, I get the following error on line 179 codeUncaught TypeError document.getElementById....onclickcode is not a function.p  pIve looked up this error on previous stackoverflow questions, and it seems what people did in the past was redeclare the function in my case, codeonclickcode to be a different function  variable. In this document, the only instance of codeonclickcode where the error is being thrown.p  pYou can view a live version of this webpage a hrefhttpla.matthewpagecs.comLinearAlgebraCalculatorindex.html relnofollowherea, and the source is below.p  pEdit Ok, I guess linking directly to my page makes it crash for some reason.

Negative 6250 pIm starting a new Android project. I got all the necessary graphical materials in .psd files. The materials are designed for 1080 x 1920 resolution, since it is also an iOS app. I was just about to resize the images for various screen densities, when I ran into a weird issue.p  pOnce I sliced a few images, I decided to run some tests in emulator. The test image I used is one of the menu images. Its size is 240 x 240 px and, as one would expect, takes about a quarter of screens width in the .psd file. However, once I put said image in my app and ran it on 1080 x 1920 emulator, the image took up almost 23 of the screens width.

This kind of works, but it is difficult to parse on the backend since the result is in the form of codecount, eventidcode, also count is needlessly repeated over all result rows. I was hoping I could simply add codetotalcode as an codeOUTcode param and have the function return the table and fill the OUT variable with total count, however it seems this is not allowed. I can always have the count be a separate function but I was wondering if there is a better way to approach this issue p

Negative 6250 pI cannot get the DropDownHeight of the ComboBox set properly to display all the items.p  pI am using a control that inherits from the ComboBox.  I have overridden the OnDrawItem and OnMeasureItem methods in order to create multiple columns and textwrapping within a column if it is required.  This all works fine.p  pThe problem occurs when I try to set the DropDownHeight.  I set the DropDownHeight at an arbitrarily large value, a good bit larger than the list of items. The ComboBox control appears to automatically truncate any value for DropDownHeight that is larger than the size of all the displayed items in the list. Assuming that you have the MaxDropDownItems property set higher than the number of items, which I do.  Normally this behavior works perfectly, as shown below img srchttpwww.freeimagehosting.netuploadsdd09404697.png altalt text p  pNo, thats not my real data in the dropdown box.p  pThe problem occurs when I have an entry in the dropdown that needs to wrap in order to display the full text.  This entry displays fine, but however the ComboBox is calculating the DropDownHeight, it ignores the fact that one of the entries is twice as tall as normal, so you have to scroll down one line to get to the last entry in the dropdown. img srchttpwww.freeimagehosting.netuploadsd0ef715f83.png altalt text p  pThis is the code that I am using to determine if an item needs text wrapping and to set the height of each itemp  precode Protected Overrides Sub OnMeasureItemByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MeasureItemEventArgs     MyBase.OnMeasureIteme     Determine the proper height of the current row in the dropdown based on     the length of the OptionDescription string.

Negative 6250 pI came across an implementation of the nearest neighbor algorithm for finding matches between certain keypoints in two similar images. The keypoints were generated by the SIFT algorithm. The points are described by a 128 dimension vector, and there are many such points in both images.p  pThe matching algorithm uses the nearest neighbor search and for each point in one image, calculates the corresponding closest point in the other image. The closeness is depicted by minimum euclidean distance between the vectors of the points. The best such matches are selected by taking only those pairs of points whose distance lies below a certain threshold.p  pHowever the implementation I came across multiplies all the vectors of the keypoints in one image, with those in the other image, thus forming a matrix of products. It then finds the points whose product is higher than a given threshold. p  pThis implementation gives correct results, but Id like to know how it works. Does it use correlation between the vectors as the metric or is there something else going on here. p

Negative 6250 pIve purchased a third party library that I am using from my application.  My application references a small interop dll which in turn calls into another dll non CLI to do its thing.

In addition to a local try catch, there is another one wrapped around the call to StartNew I have a call to .Wait just for debugging purposes.  That catch doesnt fire either.p  pRight now Im thinking the only solution is to create a separate program that simply waits for the other to close and then reopen it.  Which sounds horrid...p

Negative 6250 pIm at my wits end trying to figure this out and hope there is someone out there who has a solution.p  pI want to create a custom layout for an Android App. This should theoretically be straight forward enough, but I can find no useful information on how to do so.p  pIm looking for 1 A simple, stepbystep, tutorial on how to subclass the ViewGroup to create custom layouts. 2 A basic understanding of the inner mechanics of, for example, how to access child views, how and when to ask the child views to draw themselves, how to define the xml for a custom layout, how to access custom xml attributes etc.p  pIve looked all around the internet and I can only find small tidbits on it, and havent even been able to get started creating a subclass.p  pI have found 1 A talk given at a hrefhttpparleys.comid2191ampsl3ampst5 relnofollowhttpparleys.comid2191ampsl3ampst5a but it cuts off after a few minutes asking for a subscription. 2 The API reference at a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewViewGroup.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewViewGroup.htmla but this doesnt give any clue as to how to realistically implement a subclass.p

Negative 6250 pI am have been trying to teach myself ASP.NET and Javascript for a project and have been stuck on one problem for literally dozens of hours now.p  pI found a really nice javascript draganddrop list online, copied the source offered and split the css into a .css file, the javascript into a .js file and the HTML and  reference into my asp.net page. It worked perfectly. Greatp  pNext, I replaced the javascript list with a static HTML list populated with the same data, wrapped it in an UpdatePanel and set up an edit order button to swap the static lists HTML for the javascript lists HTML when the button is pressed.p  pNo Dicep  pFirst, the initial runtime would throw up javascript errors explaining that certain objects could not be found. For examplep  precodeMicrosoft JScript runtime error Unable to get value of the property getElementsByTagName object is null or undefined codepre  pUnderstood, because the elements arent actually there yet. So I removed my reference to the .js in the main header and tried to register the .js file when the update panel is changed instead.p  pThis is my problem.p  pMost explanations online have focused onRegisterClientScriptBlock, or RegisterStartupScript, or RegisterClientScriptInclude, or myLiteral and I cant get any of them to work. I also find that lots of online explanations are for running a single javascript function, whereas the script I am trying to get working has 700 linesworth of them Do I have to reference them all individuallyp  pSorry for the, no doubt, newbish question. I waited to ask until I had shouted at the screen with sufficient vitriol to warrant begging for helpp  pThanks and regards.p  pEDIT CODEp  pAs Requested, this is the codep  pVB.net this is in a sub called by the button press.

Negative 6250 pAm I correct to say that JavaScript code isnt compiled, not even JIT If so, does that mean that comments have an affect on performance, and I should be very careful where I put place my comments Such as placing function comments above and outside the function definition when possible, and definitely avoid placing comments inside loops, if I wanted to maximize performance I know that in emmostem cases at least in nonloop cases, the change in performance would be negligible, but I think that this would be something that is good to know and be aware of, especially for frontendjs developers. Also, a relevant question was asked on a js assessment I recently took.p

Negative 6250 pI am creating a monitor application that can monitor 100150 devices...Now to design a monitor application, I have two approaches  p  ol lipCreate a thread for each of the device to monitor and each thread will ping Using ICMP to device to know whether the device is online or not. These threads will run indefinately to know their status after a particular time interval say 60 seconds.  pli lipCreate a thread pool and for each device, submit a task to a thread pool. The task is simple ping to a device.   So, in the current design, the tasks will be more than the threads in thread pool. For instance, say there are 100 device to monitor, there will be 100 tasks to be monitored and thread pool will have say 40 threads to complete these 100 tasks.  Off course the time duration to run the next bunch of tasks will be such that to complete all the pending tasks in thread pool.pli ol  pWhich approach will be betterp

The project uses JavaJ2EE technology does not have any tests written at all.p  pThe dilemma that I face is since I have not written the code, I dont want to refactor the code immediately to write tests. I also have to select a testing framework. I am thinking of using Mockito and Powermock.p  pI also have to estimate code coverage for the tests. And then perform integration testing. I will have to research on integration testing tools and select one. I have not done any integration testing or estimated acceptable level of code coverage for a project before.p  pSince I am working independently, if there are some strategies, tips, suggestions on what should I start with and tools that one can recommend, I will appreciate it. p

Negative 6250 pI need to port a fairly large Visual CC Project to Android in my recently started internship. I asked another a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12034132portingvisualcctoandroidquestiona about that topic yesterday, asking for some help finding a concept for the porting. I got an answer suggesting an automated solution sth like mono for android, but after a day of research explicit for my concept, i tend to a manual solution, which shall mean that i manually remove everythin Windos and Visual specific by hand and replace it with unter Android available Functions.p  pNow, the first thing that comes to my mind is to first remove everything Visual specific by using the windows gnu Complier, and after that removing everything Windows sprecific by using the linux gnu Compiler and than make it runnable on Android using the ndk.p  pThis implicates that i port it from Windows to Linux and than from Linux to Android, assuming that the Linux to Android step is a quite small one since i hope that the Code can remain nearly unmodified from Linux to Android because Android is based on the Linux Kernel.p  pNow my question is Is this a good idea, or is porting from Linux to Android also an great effort, so that i would do all work twice, once from Windows to Linux and than another time from Linux to Androidp  pSuggestions how to do it better are absolutly welcomep  pEDIT Forget to mention, this will be part of an larger Application and does not contain any GUI Stuff of cource i know in that cause although the linux to Android Step would be heavy work, just Interfaces to the components lying above and below. p

Negative 6250 pIve been skimming over the numerous documents that describe SCORM 2004 and believe that the sequencing of activities is specified in the metadata of each SCO.  So, an SCO can define which other SCOs should be presented in case of passing or failing particular objectives that it presented.   Assuming that Im correct, this suggests that the sequencing is rather static. p  pOur current LMS, which is not SCORM compliant also prescribes which activities a student should view if they pass or fail particular objectives.  It also allows a teacher to override prescriptions.p  pDoes SCORM 2004 enable this sort of sequencingp

Negative 6250 pOn a local machine, I can just dop  precodecat etciscsiinitiatorname.iscsi codepre  pto get the IQN that is sent to targets when establishing an ISCSI session. What I am trying to find out is whether it is possible to establish another machines initiator IQN without sshing to it. This is because, given a set of IPs or hostnames of machines I have no control over, I need to set up targets to allow ISCSI logins from those machines only.p  pIt doesnt seem to be possible using, e.g., iscsiadm. Im assuming the answer is No, but Im no expert in ISCSI, so asking anyway. If the answer is No, well have to deal with the problem in some other way, perhaps by requiring the initiators to be set up with IQNs from a known pool, or even that the IQN is set to the same on all those machines I suspect there might be adverse consequences with the latter workaround, but Im not sure.p

Negative 6250 pIve been coding phpmysql for years under the assumption that varchar was meant for when you know the length of the input string  e.g. if report numbers are always 20 characters alphanumeric.

Negative 6250 pI have a rather large and involved a hrefhttpsgist.github.comdurden5367247 relnofollowdecorator to debug PyQt signalsa that I want to dynamically add to a class.  Is there a way to add a decorator to a class dynamicallyp  pI might be approaching this problem from the wrong angle, so here is what I want to accomplish.p  h2Goalh2  ol liI have a decorator that will discoverattach to all pyqt signals in a class and print debug when those signals are emitted.li liThis decorator is great for debugging a single class signals.  However, there might be a time when I would like to attach to ALL my signals in an application.  This could be used to see if Im emitting signals at unexpected times, etc.li liId like to dynamically attach this decorator to all my classes that have signals.li ol  h2Possible solutionsideash2  pIve thought through a few possible solutions so farp  ol liInheritance This would be easy if all my classes had the same base class other than Pythons builtin codeobjectcode and PyQts builtin codeQtCore.QObjectcode.  I suppose I could just attach this decorator to my base class and everything would workout as expected.  However, this is not the case in this particular application.  I dont want to change all my classes to have the same base class either.li liMonkeypatch Python codeobjectcode or codeQtCore.QObjectcode  I dont know how this would work practically.  However, in theory could I change one of these base classes codeinitcode to be the codenewinitcode I define in my decorator  This seems really dangerous and hackish but maybe its a emgoodem wayli liMetaclasses  I dont think metaclasses will work in this scenario because Id have to dynamically add the codemetaclasscode attribute to the classes I want to inject the decorator into.  I think this is impossible because to insert this attribute the class must have already been constructed.  Thus, whatever metaclass I define wont be called.  Is this true  li ol  pI tried a few variants of metaclass magic but nothing seemed to work.  I feel like using metaclasses might be a way to accomplish what I want, but I cant seem to get it working.p  pAgain, I might be going about this all wrong.  Essentially I want to attach the behavior in my decorator referenced above to all classes in my application maybe even a list of select classes.  Also, I could refactor my decorator if necessary.  I dont really care if I attach this behavior with a decorator or another mechanism.  I just assumed this decorator already accomplishes what I want for a single class so maybe it was easy to extend.p

Rails does not load such records older versions of Rails did.p  pI do not want to and cannot correct these dates manually or automated.

Negative 6250 pIve been experimenting with breezejs lately and was considering using it for a number of projects both personal and at work since I love it. I know all the rage right now is with Single Page Apps and I get it, but lets say you didnt want to introduce a new routing framework and were comfortable just using .NET MVCs default routing engine. You will lose the client side caching capabilities of breezes entity manager for the Metadata and other entities every time there is a POSTRedirect. p  pOne of the issues is we have a large set of Metadata .5mb coming down for each request made. Now if there any additional requests on the client side before redirect then that metadata is cached and everything is fine. Im trying to avoid the need to download the metadata for each view in addition to static lists that I would also cache in the entity manager. I know the metadata could be optimized by making smaller object graphs but lets not focus on that.p  pThe one thing I came up with is to store the metadata in localStorage then retrieve it on page load. p  precodefunction exportMetadata     var metadata  emanager.metadataStore.exportMetadata    window.localStorage.setItemsomename, metadata  function importMetadata     var metadata  window.localStorage.getItemsomename    var mstore  new breeze.MetadataStore    mstore.importMetadatametadataFromStorage    manager.metadataStore  mstore  codepre  pWhile this works and will work for static lists with different syntax it feels hacky and seems to go against how the library was meant to be used. I cant help but think that BreezeJS is coupled to the SPA architecture to utilized all of its features as written. Maybe Im thinking about it the wrong way Are there any suggestions or examples of how to use BreezeJS outside a SPAp

Negative 6250 pWe currently use AWS Cloudfront w our DNN 7.1 site but are having a problem with modules that use controls that require doPostBack.p  pNormally our main site doesnt use controls like that but were doing a revamp and want to add some new features that do require it.

What weve done for now is created a page on one of our subdomains which is not on CloudFront and setup an IFrame to display it which works but is less than ideal for various reasons.p  pUpon examination it seems like this is due to Cloudfront stripping the user agent and replacing it with Amazon CloudFront.p  pI tried creating a custom .browser file which seems to be recognized but the Request.Browser call still says Unknown.

Negative 6250 pAssume that I have defined two arrays in Java. The first array has codemcode cells and the second has codencode cells. Assume that each cells can have a code0code or code1code value. p  pIn this program every cell of the first array will join one of the cells of the second array, but we do not know which one will be connected to which cell of the second array This connection is totally logical,e.g. we just know codearray1[3]code is related to codearray2[7]code.p  pSo now I want to define an event handler for each of these relationship, so when one of the cells fluctuate from 1 to 0, its paired cell fluctuate.

Python 2.7 is the only version I have on this computer specifically 2.7.5, Anaconda 1.8.0 64bit.

Ihave looked around other similar topics in the forum but often Im confused trying to understanding their content, therefore I decided to write down my problem here.p  pMy problem is all about creating a minimap in the left bottom corner of the game screen showing the entire world with actors. Id like to use the scene2d concept as much as possible.p  pFor now Im concentrating on the desktop version of the game.p  pI have a windows screen ... saying width  800, height  600p  pThe top class of the game, MyOp0Game, is like thisp  precodepublic class MyOp0Game extends Game      MyScreen0 myscreen0     Override    public void create          allocate screen       myscreen0  new MyScreen0this         set current screen       setScreenmyscreen0         Override         public void render               super.render              codepre  pThe MyScreen0 class is like thisp  precodepublic class MyScreen0 implements Screen      protected final Stage stage0     protected final MyOp0Game game     protected final MyActor0 actor0     protected final MyActor0 actor1      public MyScreen0MyOp0Game game            link screen to game        this.game  game           allocate stage viewport size maps screen size         this.stage0  new Stage Gdx.graphics.getWidth,Gdx.graphics.getHeight, true            allocate actor0 and add to stage         this.actor0  new MyActor0         this.actor0.setPosition0, 0         this.stage0.addActorthis.actor0           allocate actor1 and add to stage, actor1 is placed next to actor0         this.actor1  new MyActor0         this.actor1.setPosition1000, 0         this.stage0.addActorthis.actor1            Override     public void renderfloat delta            the following code clears the screen with the given RGB color green         Gdx.gl.glClearColor 0f, 1f, 0f, 1f          Gdx.gl.glClear GL20.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT               translate stage camera to go from actor0 to actor1         this.stage0.getCamera.translate1, 0, 0           draw stage gt draw actors         this.stage0.draw            Override     public void resizeint width, int height      TODO Autogenerated method stub            Override     public void show      not required as no abstract screen for now    super.show           Override     public void hide      TODO Autogenerated method stub            Override     public void pause      TODO Autogenerated method stub            Override     public void resume      TODO Autogenerated method stub            Override     public void dispose     this.stage0.dispose        codepre  pFinally the MyActor0 class is like this p  precodepublic class MyActor0 extends Actor      SpriteBatch batch    Texture texture     public MyActor0              batch  new SpriteBatch         texture  new TextureGdx.files.internaldatalibgdx.png              public void drawSpriteBatch batch, float alpha                  batch.drawtexture,this.getX,this.getY           codepre  pThe stage viewport is of the same size as the window screen. The actor texture is smaller than the viewport and therefore the first actor is visible and the second actor is not visible as it is next to the viewport. p  pI would like to insert in the bottom left a minimap showing the two actors or equivalent markers.p  pIve tried several options but it never works, using two cameras and switching between them, two stagesp  pI think one fundamental question I have is  does the viewport always fills the windows screenp

I would obviously like it to be as quick as possible.p  pWhen returning exclusively the runeId number from the JSON, it is instant. What I need to do however, is retrieve the name associated with that ID and return that. I have done a traceview on the section of code and included it below. Im not sure how to read it, but I am sure the section at fault is my method of getting the name from the id getRuneInfo.p  pUltimately, what Id like to do is store this information locally on the device, that way, over time, it wouldnt have to access the server, as the idname pair would be stored locally, but I am unsure how to do this. p  pTraceview File a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms4fc6kdk35wackwrRuneLoop.trace relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms4fc6kdk35wackwrRuneLoop.traceap  pThe loopp  precode Loop through pages, page names stored in string array for int i  0 i lt rune.length i      JSONObject c  rune.getJSONObjecti     JSONArray slots  c.getJSONArrayTAGSLOTS     name[i]  c.getStringTAGNAME       This loop is where the slowdown is.

Negative 6250 pI had a razor view with inline javascript which with time has become messy, and now I am moving all js except some minimal initialization code to external typescript file. It would be nice to make the js code reusable, but it is very much specific to this particular view. The js code depends heavily on many html elements. What I have is something like thisp  precodemodule MyModule  export class SomeClass      private counter any     private answers any     private pager any     private anotherSelector1any     private anotherSelector2any     private anotherSelector3any     private anotherSelector4any     private someId number      constructorpublic options any           this.initoptions            private initoptions          setup objects, callbacks, other init code         codepre  pand I call it from my cshtml file like thisp  precode document.readyfunction            var instance  new MyModule.SomeClass             counter something,             answers something,             pager something,             code omitted for brevity             someId Model.SomeId,                  codepre  pIt seems to me that even though this approach will result in a more clean razor view, the typescript file will still have many dependencies to the html DOM. Am I doing it right Should I consider refactoring the html in the view as well Also, should I move the init code in the cshtml file to the ts file as well or should I leave it like it is I am kind of looking for best practices when doing refactorings like this.p

Negative 6250 pI have a project originally developed with JSF 2.0 within RichFaces 4.2 and recently integrated with Spring Webflow 2.4.0 and Spring Framework 3.2 basically for support multiple browser tab per session.

Then I use the a4jpoll component to refresh partial page and query for this attributes and show their new values. The backing bean has an attribute to keep reference to the topic connection a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee6apijavaxjmsTopicConnection.html relnofollowjavax.jms.TopicConnectiona once it suscribe itself for unsuscribe and close the conntecion later.p  pNow I want to do the same thing but the backing bean cant keep reference to the topic connection because it is not serializable doesnt implement java.io.Serializable and the backing bean must be serializable to be defined as a webflow variable.p  pThe originally solution was developed with the restriction of automatically suscribe to the topic whenever the page is accessed to update the information recived it means, update the backing beans attributes in the wake of message recieve to finally show on the pagep  pHow could achive thisp  pI try to define a a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs3.2.2.RELEASEspringframeworkreferencehtmlsinglejmsmdpdefault relnofollowDefaultMessageListenerContainera and a Spring bean message listener. So the backing bean inject Autowired the listener and suscribe itself, then the listener notify when a message arrives. But it seems that I am not taking care of an issue with the behavior between the threadscopessomething of the Spring JMS container and the Spring MVC container.p  pLike you see I tried to implement a kind of observerdispatcher patter where the subjectobservable is the message listener and the backing beans observe it. If there is another approach, like the backing bean consulting to the listener, I am all ears too.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestion or clarify what I missing here.p  pRegardsp

Negative 6250 pWhilst benchmarking a realworld application I came across a surprising performance characteristic relating to the zlib and zip libraries that ship with Delphi. p  pMy realworld application exports .xlsx files. This file format is a collection of XML files wrapped in a ZIP container file. The .xlsx export code generates the XML files and then feeds them to the Delphi ZIP library. Once I had optimised the XML file generation to the point where the ZIP creation was the bottleneck I discovered, to my surprise, that 64 bit code was significantly slower than 32 bit code.p  pIn order to study this further I created this test programp  precodeprogram zlibperf  APPTYPE CONSOLE  uses   System.SysUtils, System.Classes, System.Diagnostics, System.Zip  const   LoremIpsum      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod      tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Negative 6250 pMy aim is to write an abstract base class which contains a method for deriving child instances. In this method already some computation is done which is common in all deriving classes.p  pThe difficulty is that the base class is not able to create the child class on its own. So I introduced a type parameter codeTcode in my base class and a codeprotected abstractcode method which shall return an instance of codeTcode.p  precodepublic abstract class BaseltTgt where T  BaseltTgt      public T GetChild              string param  ComplexComputation         return NewInstanceFromparam           protected abstract T NewInstanceFromstring param     somewhere else   public class Derivative  BaseltDerivativegt      public Derivative        protected sealed override Derivative NewInstanceFromstring param              return new Derivativeparam           private Derivativestring param               some configuration       codepre  pThe disadvantage of this approach is that I cannot ensure that codeNewInstanceFromcode is only invoked by the base class. It could also be invoked by classes inheriting from codeDerivativecode. Thats what I want to avoid.p  pSo I could encapsulate the functionality in a private class or delegatep  precodepublic abstract class BaseltTgt where T  BaseltTgt      public T GetChild              string param  ComplexComputation         return subElementDerivatorparam           protected BaseltTgtFuncltstring, Tgt subElementDerivator              this.subElementDerivator  subElementDerivator           private Funcltstring, Tgt subElementDerivator     somewhere else   public class Derivative  BaseltDerivativegt      public Derivative          basederiveSubElement                    private Derivativestring param          basederiveSubElement               some configuration           private static Derivative deriveSubElementstring param              return new Derivativeparam       codepre  pBut this introduces a new object.p  pIs there a simpler way to prevent access to a functionality which the base class shall have access to from heirs of codeDerivativecodep

TicketBooks are 25 Tickets long.p  pegp  precode                        TicketBooks                          TicketBookNum    TicketNum    UnitID    FirstTicket    LastTicket  Used        101              101          120           101           126       Yes      101              102          120           101           126       Yes      101              103          120           101           126       No      101              104          120           101           126       Yes      etc... codepre  pThis table has all tickets that are used and not used in the database. p  pstrongDifferent TicketBooks can be issued to different units at the same time. So TicketBook 101 can be issued to Unit 120, while TicketBook 151 can be issued to 140.strongp  pWhat my stored procedure needs to do is return all Tickets that are marked as not used, but also have a ticket that is greater than it that is marked Used.p  pExamplep  precodeTicketBookNum    TicketNum  Used     101              101        Yes    101              102        Yes    101              103        No    101              104        Yes    101              105        Yes    101              106        No    101              107        No    etc.. codepre  pSo the stored procedure returns Ticket code103code, but not code106code and code107code because there are no tickets inside that ticketbook after them that are marked as Used.p  pThis is currently the stored procedure that I am usingp  precodeselect TicketNum from TicketBooks where UsedNo and TicketNum between 92226 and 92251 and TicketNum lt select top 1 TicketNum                 from TicketBooks                 where UsedYes                 and TicketNum between 92226 and 92251                 order by TicketNum desc order by TicketNum desc codepre  pThis will return the missing tickets from the TicketBook 82226. If I try to change the parameters on the codebetweencode clause then it does not return the correct results. Any help will be appreciated.p

I am assuming that I have already give a code for each character. I have the font of this character set. Problem is, when I hit a key from virtual keyboard, it will write the key as, for example, q.

Negative 6250 pIm not sure Im phrasing that well, but what I want to do is this. I emusedem to have code like thisp  precodeSelect Case name   Case ThisProperty ...   Case ThatProperty ...   ... End Select codepre  pbut codenamecode is a property on an object, and I want to do this in a typesafe way, so that if the property changes, I catch it as a compile time error. So I want this kind of pseudocodep  precodeSelect Case name   Case PropertyNameOf MyTypeFunctionx x.ThisProperty ...   Case PropertyNameOf MyTypeFunctionx x.ThatProperty ...   ... End Select codepre  pwherep  precodeFunction PropertyNameOf TpropertySpecifier As ExpressionOf FuncOf T, Object As String     Return expression magic to get property name as a string End Function codepre  pMy codePropertyNamecode function works fine, but you cant code a codeSelect Casecode like this, and even if you could, Im worried that it would be really inefficient, in a tight loop anyway, because of all the expression manipulation. And the syntax is really tedious, too.p  pSo Im wondering if theres a reasonable way to code this to address these two three concerns.p
Negative 6250 pIm confused about VBOs and modern openGL. There is a direct question in in the end of this post, then there is a bundle of them on the way there. If youve got any insigt into any of this, Id be greatful for a reply. And if you reply, please regard me as a compleate idiot, with no knowledge whatsoever. p  pSo, my history is thisp  pIve got a game, which is a top down 2d game. Ive used immideate mode to render 2d sprites. The actual texture coordinates of my texture atlases were static and predefined in a seperate class. The quad coordinates were defined in each entity and updated as the game progressed. When I rendered, I simply bound a specific texture, called glBegintriangles, then called each visable objects render method. This in turn sent both quad coordinates and texure coordinates to my Renderer class, which made the openGl calls. I then flushed the texture, which only calls glEnd.p  pI did this for for all different atlases and in the order so that I got the proper depth.p  pBut times change indeed. I want to move to use VBOs and shaders. Ive tried several times in the past, but failed misserably. There are simply a few things I cant find on google to give me a complete understanding of it, and how I can use it to speed up my game.p  pI know the basics. Instead of sending all the information over the bus to the gpu each render call, I can simply store everything Ill need in the initization phase and then use shaders to calculate the end result. But...p  pIve got an idea for the texture coordinates. These will be static, as they will never change. It would make sence to store them on the GPU. But how do I know which coordinates correspond to each QUADTRIANGLE. Im thinking that instead of four floats, each renderable object in the game can have some kind of index, which it passes as an attribute to the vertex shader. the vertex shader uses the index to lookup the four texure coordinates in the VBO. Is this a feasable solution How would you implement something like thatp  pBut as for the quad vertecies Im lost. These will move arround constantly. They will be visable, then dissapear, etc. That means that my quad VBO will change at each render call and the code Ive seen that updates a VBO is quite ugly. Ive seen something likep  ul listore the 4 quad coordinates in an array.li licreate a floatbuffer, put them in thereli limanipulate the buffer.li lisend the buffer to the VBOli ul  pLooks quite expensive to me. And I dont understand how I can delete a certain entry if an entity moves out of screen, etc., nor how I can manipulate a certain entry an entity moves. And if I have to update the VBO in this manner each render call, whats the performance gain Looks more like a loss to me...p  pAlso, how can I keep track of the depth of the resulted image. Im doing 2d, but with depth i mean the order of rendering, e.g. making sure object2 is rendered ontop of object1. A different VBO for each depth perhaps Or should I use the zcoordinate for this and enbale depth stuff. Will the latter not give a performense hit p  pAlso theres the 2d factor. I have the utmost respect for 3d, but I want to use 2d and take advantage of the fact that it should in theory yield better performance. However, from what Ive gathered, this doesnt seem to be the case. In opengl 3 It seemes that in order for me to render 2d stuff, I need to translate it to 3d first, since thats whats processes in the harware. Seems odd to me since the end result on screen is 2d. Is there a way to circumvent this, and save the GPU the work of 2d  3d  2d  p  pIn other words, how can I efficienty change thisp  precodeclass main  void main whiletrue Renderer.bind call render in all gameObjects Renderer.flush     class GameObject  private float X1, X2, Y1, Y2 private TexureCoordinate tex  renderfloat dt update X1, X2...

Negative 6250 pi am trying to upgrade an existing database for online job finding and hiring website, the main goal is to make the table for people more browsble by adding categories, features, better tag system, and subcategoriesp  phere is the problem each category have its own subcategory and features, for example when a user is seeing people in teaching category, the user might want to find out if they teach privatlyhomeschoolso i add a bit type colume for that feature, but as you might know, not all categories need a home schooling feature, for example other categories like, computer, engnier, medican and other stuff, that means all of these rows with category other than teaching will all have a useless NULL in them that takes a 1 byte that might not sound a lot but at the end i might end up having tons of such useless NULLs in each row that wasting space.p  pi also cant create table for each category since the people table have realtions with other tables like users,comments, images and etc....p  pwhat do you suggest i do p

Negative 6250 pWhile compiling a translation unit the compiler is doing a lot of optimizations  inlining, constant foldingpropagation, alias analysis, loop unrolling, dead code elimination and many others I havent even heard of. Are all of them done when using LTOLTCGWPO between multiple translation units or is just a subset or a variant of them done Ive heard about inlining If not all optimizations are done I would consider unity builds superior to LTO or maybe using them both when there are more than 1 unity source files.p  pMy guess is that its not the same unity builds having the full set of optimizations and also that it varies a lot across compilers.p  pThe documentation on lto of each compiler doesnt precisely answer this or I am failing at understanding it.p  pSince lto involves saving the intermediate representation in the object files in theory LTO could do all the optimizations... rightp  pNote that I am not asking about build speed  that is a separate issue.p  pstrongEDITstrong I am mostly interested in gccllvm.p
