Positive 25430 pI have a question about 2D array table. So, the assignment is that we are given a class inside which there is a method called addCountry add country data to the 2D table. the table is declared and initialized inside the constructor.  The problem is that in another class K for example, the instance of the class that has table is created, and it calls the addCountry and every time it calls the method, it wants to put a set of data of one country in it. So, lets say, three times, it calls the method, and there will be three sets of data entered separately. Then, how can I design this addCountry method so that each time a new country comes in, it will automatically go to next rowp  pthis is the calling codep  precodedouble[]canada1.1,2.0,3.5 double[]mexico1.1,2.0,3.5 dataSet data  new dataSetint colm, int row data.addCountrycanada, canada data.addCountrymexico, mexico codepre  pThanks very muchp

Positive 25430 pI have a TIFF image file from a confocal microscope which I can open in ImageJ, but which I would like to get into Python.p  pThe format of the TIFF is as follows There are 30 stacks in the Z dimension. Each Z layer has three channels from different fluorescent markers. Each channel has a depth of 8 bits. The image dimensions are 1024x1024.p  pI can, in principle, read the file with skimage which I plan to use to further analyse the data using the tifffile plugin. However, what I get is not quite what I expect.p  precodemerged  io.imreadmerge.tif, plugintifffile merged.shape  30, 3, 3, 1024, 1024  zslice, RGB, channel, height, width merged.dtype  dtypeuint16 codepre  pWhat confused me initially was the fact that I get two axes of length 3. I emthinkem that this is because tifffile treats each channel as separate RGB images, but I can work around this by subsetting or using codeskimage.color.rgb2greycode on the individual channels. What concerns me more is that the file is imported as a 16 bit image. I can convert it back using codeskimage.imgasubytecode, embutem afterwards, the histogram does no longer match the one I see in ImageJ.p  pI am not fixated on using skimage to import the file, but I would like to get the image into a numpy array eventually to use skimages functionality on it. p

Negative 25430 pI have a client application that connects to the MySQL database 4 server using stock libraries on SuSE SLES 9.  However, at times when processing a particular reset set from the server, iterating throw the results does not allow me to process all the results that is in the database. p  pThis issue happens sometimes, mostly when servers have had several days of uptime.  I would suspect that a reboot solves the problem. p  pIs there anyway that not releasing the MySQL result set over time gives rise to this memory leak and displays itself in this strange behavior must all result sets always be freed However same table and same program behaves as should on another computer.  p  pCould corruption of the result set occur because of implementation issues in either the application or the mysql client libraryp

Negative 25430 pWe have been using Spring Remoting in our project for sometime. It is used with some other systems to access our webservices.

We did a spike and it seems that irrespective of newly added fields at our ends the remoting service continues to work fine.

Only additions have been made.p  pDoes spring remoting handles additional fields gracefully or I should expect it to crib p  pLet me know if my question is not clear at any point.

Negative 25430 pIt is safe to read a STL container from multiple parallel threads.  However, the performance is terrible.  Whyp  pI create a small object that stores some data in a multiset.  This makes the constructors fairly expensive  about 5 usecs on my machine.   I store hundreds of thousands of the small objects in a large multiset.  Processing these objects is an independent business, so I split the work between threads running on a multicore machine.  Each thread reads the objects it needs from the large multiset, and processes them.p  pThe problem is that the reading from the big multiset does not proceed in parallel.  It looks like the reads in one thread block the reads in the other.p  pThe code below is the simplest I can make it and still show the problem.  First it creates a large multiset containing 100,000 small objects each containing its own empty multiset.  Then it calls the multiset copy constructor twice in series, then twice again in parallel.p  pA profiling tool shows that the serial copy constructors take about 0.23 secs, whereas the parallel ones take twice as long.  Somehow the parallel copies are interfering with each other.p  precode a trivial class with a significant ctor and ability to populate an associative container class cTest      multisetltintgt mine     int id public     cTest int i   id i       bool operatorltconst cTestamp o const  return  id lt o.id     add 100,000 objects to multiset void Populate multisetltcTestgtamp m       for int k  0 k lt 100000 k               m.insertcTestk        copy construct multiset, called from mainline void Copy const multisetltcTestgtamp m       cRavenProfile profilecopymain     multisetltcTestgt copy m    copy construct multiset, called from thread void Copy2 const multisetltcTestgtamp m       cRavenProfile profilecopythread     multisetltcTestgt copy m   int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      cRavenProfile profiletest     profile.Start      multisetltcTestgt master      Populate master        two calls to copy ctor from mainline     Copy master      Copy master        call copy ctor in parrallel     boostthread pt1  new boostthread boostbind Copy2, master      boostthread pt2  new boostthread boostbind Copy2, master       pt1gtjoin     pt2gtjoin       display profiler results     cRavenProfile printprofile      return 0  codepre  pHere is the outputp  precode            Scope   Calls       Mean secs     Total       copythread        2      0.472498        0.944997         copymain        2      0.233529        0.467058 codepre

Negative 25430 pIm trying to work with MS Project files in an ASP.NET application, and came across the a hrefhttpmpxj.sourceforge.net relnofollowMPXJ librarya, which started out in Java and has been converted to a .NET version as well. It works fine in .NET, but the difficulty Im finding with it is that all its methods use Java data types and not native .NET ones. This means that for things like formatting a date or number that is returned I have to go read up on java.text.NumberFormat, and the other Javastyle ways to interact with things.p  pSo my question is am I doing something wrong, or do I basically have to program in Java style to interact with this library in .NET I can certainly manage it, but Im not sure what it will mean for future maintainability when someone looks at my code.p  pI guess another part to this question would be is there any other good, free, mechanism for interacting with .mpp files besides MPXJ The other two options Ive seen are a installing MS Project on the server and using the OLEDB provider cant install because its shared hosting, and b buying Aspose.Tasks component at least 600.p

Users cannot define new ones, only instantiate them.li liA Gizmo has any number of Instances in any order. An Instance has one Module ID.li liInstances are configurable, but the available settings depend on the Module ID. A Foo Module may require an integer and a string, while a Bar Module may require a arbitrarylength list of strings.li liEach Instance of a Module can be provided different setting values a Gizmo that has two Instances of Foo Modules may set 5, baz on one and 100, frob on the other.li ul  pSo Ive got an Instance table with an Instance ID, a Gizmo ID, a Module ID, and an Order.p  pAnd Ive got a table for each type of Module, keyed on Instance ID, representing the settings for that Instance.

Negative 25430 pIm using an codeXmlWritercode to send an XMPP Jingle stream.

Negative 25430 pAs the complexity of the web projects that I am working on increases, the need to include a MVC structure is becoming more urgent.  My model classes are well defined, but view and controller code tends to get munged together.  Ive been using pretty heavy AJAX on the site also RichFaces jsFunctions mostly which makes things slightly more complicated.p  pHas anyone found good strategies for implementing MVC using JSF2  I do not want to introduce another framework to the project e.g. Spring MVC.p  pSome ideas thus far, which I havent started doing yetp  ul liFor a page with heavy ajax, have a view bean for remembering selected tabs, selected items, providing filtered lists of data, etc...li liHave a controller bean to handle actions such as changes to the modelli liHave command beans which go between the JSF page and controller.  A jsFunction populates the command bean with parameters, and calling codecommand.executecode causes the command bean to call the correct method on the controller bean to perform the action.  The command bean may include some javascript to be called on completion.  It may also specify regions of the page to be rerendered.li ul  pAny thoughtsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhat I see pretty often are strongmanaged beans that tend to do everythingstrong keep track of users selections, update the model, get filtered lists, etc...  p  pWere using JSF 1.2 at the moment and so we cant use actionsactionlisteners with parameters.  So for example, our managed beans contain variables such as codemselectedDatecode whose only purpose is to feed the selected date to the backend on the call to codeupdateFilteredItemsBasedOnDatecode.  It would be nice if the extra variables could go away since they are just temporary.  JSF 2s EL with parameters should help but Im curious if there is an alternate solution available.p  pI am curious if there is a way to apply MVC to managed beans, or some method of separating concerns so that we dont end up with large beans that try to do everything.p

All chunks of a file will be served up in chunks that are lt64KB, but when I use the following code, the max amount of bytes that I receive is around 15040 even though the contentlength of the response is  64KBp  precodeString response    URL url  new URLuriPath URLConnection conn  url.openConnection   conn.setConnectTimeout30  1000 conn.setReadTimeout30  1000  InputStream stream  conn.getInputStream ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOut  new ByteArrayOutputStream  int c byte[] buffer  new byte[4096]  while c  stream.readbuffer  1      byteArrayOut.writebuffer,0,c   body  byteArrayOut.toByteArray   stream.close result.putConstants.HEADERCONTENTLENGTH, conn.getHeaderFieldConstants.HEADERCONTENTLENGTH result.putConstants.HEADERCONTENTCHECKSUM, conn.getHeaderFieldConstants.HEADERCONTENTCHECKSUM result.putConstants.KEYBODY, new Stringbody codepre  pWeve tested our server component, and that serves the file correctly when accessing a chunk with wget or in a browser  this java client is the only problematic client we were able to find. p  pIs this a problem with Javas URLConnection class, or is there something in my code that is wrong with reading a binary file that is returned in a responsep  pNote I am using Java 1.6 in Eclipse and from the command line.p

Negative 25430 pIm currently working on a project in c where I have a service running as LocalSystem, and a user application tray app running for each logged on user.p  pI need to have communications between the two. Initially Ive set up an endpoint using NetTcpBinding on the service for the clients to connect to and supply their username. Thereafter the clients each set up an endpoint themselves as such net.tcplocalhost5001UserAppusername, with port sharing enabled. The service can then connect to that endpoint, knowing the username.p  pThough, when trying to get the program to work well with UAC I ran into some issues. Port sharing with UAC enabled requires the user to be registred in ltallowAccounts of SMSvcHost.exe.config, and even though Ive added the user, I still get the following errror when trying to register the endpointp  blockquote   pThe service endpoint failed to listen on the URI   net.tcplocalhost5001UserAppmyuser because access was denied.

Negative 25430 pI posted this a couple of days ago on the Microchip Forum a hrefhttpwww.microchip.comforumstm.aspxm602359herea but the only response has been crickets. The I2C code below works most of the time but occasionally on powerup there is a bus collision BCLIF and the I2C module is unable to recover after the BCLIF.  The I2C lines are pulled up by 3.3K ohms.  Using REALICE and breakpoints I can see that codei2cwritecode resets BCLIF and returns FALSE when BCLIF is set.  I have used a scope to verify that the I2C bus has flatlined.  Reinitializing the PIC18F25K20 I2C module see codeiniti2ccode below when codei2cwritecode returns FALSE does not help.  The PIC18F25K20 I2C is connected to a single slave device MCP4018 I2C Digital POT. I have used this same code on previous PIC18 projects without issue so I replaced the MCP4018 suspecting a bad part but see no difference. Is there a way to reset the PIC18F25K20 I2C module when it is locked up  p  precodevoid initi2cI2CBAUDRATE baudrate, float freqmhz        UINT32 freqcycle       Reset i2c       SSPCON1  0      SSPCON2  0      PIR2bits.BCLIF  0       Set baud rate        SSPADD  Fosc4  Fscl  1       freqcycle  UINT32 freqmhz  1e6  4.0      if baudrate  I2C1MHZ                SSPADD  UINT8 freqcycle  1000000L  1          SSPSTATbits.SMP  1         disable slew rate for 1MHz operation             else if baudrate  I2C400KHZ                SSPADD  UINT8 freqcycle  400000L  1          SSPSTATbits.SMP  0         enable slew rate for 400kHz operation             else  default to 100 kHz case                 SSPADD  UINT8 freqcycle  100000L  1          SSPSTATbits.SMP  1         disable slew rate for 1MHz operation              Set to Master Mode       SSPCON1bits.SSPM3  1      SSPCON1bits.SSPM2  0      SSPCON1bits.SSPM1  0      SSPCON1bits.SSPM0  0       Enable i2c       SSPCON1bits.SSPEN  1    BOOL i2cwriteUINT8 addr, const void reg, UINT16 regsize, const void data, UINT16 datasize        UINT16 i      const UINT8  dataptr, regptr        convert void ptr to UINT8 ptr       regptr   const UINT8  reg      dataptr  const UINT8  data       check to make sure i2c bus is idle       while   SSPCON2 amp 0x1F    SSPSTATbits.RW                   initiate Start condition and wait until its done       SSPCON2bits.SEN  1      while SSPCON2bits.SEN                 check for bus collision       if PIR2bits.BCLIF                PIR2bits.BCLIF  0          returnFALSE             format address with write bit clear last bit to indicate write       addr ltlt 1      addr amp 0xFE       send out address       if writebyteaddr          returnFALSE       send out registercmd bytes       for i  0 i lt regsize i                if writebyteregptr              returnFALSE             send out data bytes       for i  0 i lt datasize i                if writebytedataptr              returnFALSE             initiate Stop condition and wait until its done       SSPCON2bits.PEN  1      whileSSPCON2bits.PEN                 check for bus collision       if PIR2bits.BCLIF                PIR2bits.BCLIF  0          returnFALSE            returnTRUE    BOOL writebyteUINT8 byte         send out byte       SSPBUF  byte      if SSPCON1bits.WCOL        check for collision                 returnFALSE            else                whileSSPSTATbits.BF    wait for byte to be shifted out                            check to make sure i2c bus is idle before continuing       while   SSPCON2 amp 0x1F    SSPSTATbits.RW                   check to make sure received ACK       if SSPCON2bits.ACKSTAT          returnFALSE      returnTRUE    codepre

Negative 25430 pOk, so quick explanation. I have an app that consists of 3 files.p  pMain.java, License.java ,App.javap  pFor an example. This app does function 100 except for what i am about to ask. This app does contain a webview and in here lays the issue. I have researched and most everything points to orientation changes. I am not having a problem with orientation because i force landscape at the moment. I am having an issue with the phone going to sleep.p  pWhen it wakes, it reloads the page inside the webview.

Negative 25430 pCurrently Im working on a small program that reads large files and sorts them. After some benchmarking I stumbled upon a weird performance issue. When the input file got to large the writing of the output file took longer than the actual sorting. So I went deeper into the code and finally realized that the fputsfunction might be the problem. So I wrote this little benchmarking programm.p  precodeinclude stdio.h include ctime  int main      int i     const int linecount  50000000     Test Line with 184 byte     const char dummyline  THIS IS A LONG TEST LINE JUST TO SHOW THAT THE WRITER IS GUILTY OF GETTING SLOW AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DATA THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN. hkgjhkdsfjhgk jhksjdhfkjh skdjfhk jshdkfjhksjdhfrn     clockt start  clock     clockt last  start      FILE fp1  fopenDlargeTestFile.txt, w     fori0 iltlinecount i         fputsdummyline, fp1         ifi1000000             printfi Lines written.r, i             ifi1000000  0                 clockt ms  clocklast                 printfWritting of i Lines took i msn, i, ms                 last  clock                                printfi Lines written.n, i     fclosefp1     clockt ms  clockstart     printfWritting of i Lines took i msn, i, ms   codepre  pWhen you execute the programm, you can see a clear drop of performance after about 14 to 15 mio lines which is about 2.5GB of data. The writing takes about 3 times as long as before. The threshold of 2GB indicate a 64bit issue, but I havent found anything about that in the web. I also tested if there is a difference between binary and charactermode e.g. wb and w, but there is none. I also tried to preallocate the filesize to avoid file fragmentation by seeking to the expected end and writing a zerobyte, but that had also little to no effect.p  pIm running a Windows 7 64bit machine but Ive tested it on a Windows Server 2008 64bit R1 machine as well. Currently Im testing on a NTFS filesystem with more than 200GB of free space. My system has 16GB of RAM so that shouldnt be a problem either. The testprogram only uses about 700KB. The page faults, which I suspected earlier, are also very low 400 page faults during whole runtime.p  pI know that for such large data the fwritefunction would suite the task better, but at the moment Im interested if there is another workaround and why this is happening. Any help would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 25430 pI have a class in my Python module that frobs widgets. It has several ways to do this, but I dont know ahead of time which ones, if any, will actually work, and I might figure out new ways to frob the widgets later. Also, frobbing widgets can be expensive. So Id like to have an instance of my class be able to look at itself, find all of the methods that it has for frobbing widgets, and to start trying to frob widgets until it succeeds, at which point it should stop caring about the methods it hasnt yet tried. p  precodeclass WidgetFrobber     def simpleFrobAttemptwidget, data          fastest way, might not work     def cleverFrobAttemptwidget, data          fiddly, fast, and doesnt always work     def boringFrobAttemptwidget, data          works most of the time, often slow     def desperateFrobAttemptwidget, data          doesnt always work, pathetically slow codepre  pWith that in place, Id like to define a method of the class that looks for methods named code[az]FrobAttemptcode, makes a list of them, and tries to frob widgets until the widget is successfully frobbed at which point it should stop caring about other methods or it runs out of possible methods. Since its my code, I can make sure that the codewhateverFrobAttemptcode methods all have the same naming conventions and required arguments. Its embestem if theres some ordering to the list of methods, so that the ones with a better average speed get tried first, but its acceptable if theyre attempted in randomish order.p  pIs there a sane way to do this such that when new codeweirdFrobAttemptcode methods are added, theyll be tried automatically, or am I better off just maintaining a hardcoded list of such methods and iterating over that p

Negative 25430 pI would like to have a column in an org mode table that is a simple monotonically increasing value, i.e. the row number such that wnen I insert and remove random rows the index value adjusts automagically.

So a simple example spreadsheet where there are two columns, one the row index value and the other some fixed value, would be a perfect answer.p

I am sending it back to the Master computer, so its state can be monitored from a central location. If I had 100 computation nodes and they didnt return their objects, it would get really messy I think to keep track of them all.p  pIt works pretty good so far unless the job isnt processed by the time it tries to send out another and results in sending a stale object with an old state ie, the same object as the last minute. Please comment if this doesnt make sense and I will do my best to explain it.p

Negative 25430 pI have a legacy DCOM server and client application both written in Delphi v6. The DCOM server is currently configured to run once and service all clients. The main reason for it running once is that the server provides an interface to an accounts application and must logon and can only do this once for a given user name.p  pOur customer now wants to upgrade their server to Windows Server 2008 R2 leaving the clients on Windows XP but I have been unable to replicate the current setup. p  pThe current set up that I can get to work on a test rig is slightly odd p  ol liI have to configure DCOM settings to allow remote launch or I get access denied on the clientli liIf the DCOM server is not already running, when the client tries to connect to it I get server execution failed.li liIf the server is running and the launch permission is set to allow remote launch, the client starts a new instance of the DCOM server rather than using the instance already started. This then causes problems in the accounts application as the same user tries to logon which is not allowed.li liIf I close the DCOM server running on the server, the client happily works away with its own instance. I cannot see the DCOM servers main form though as its running in the background can see it in task managerli ol  pIve found various articles to do with this problem but nothing so far has worked. These include running the DCOM server as administrator, not running the DCOM server as administrator, allowing COM in the firewall, adding the DCOM server to the firewall, the DCOM server located in SysWOW64, using the 32 bit version of DCOMCNFG, etc.p  pNow not sure where to go...p  pThanks for any helpp  pSimonp

Negative 25430 pI use the Ruby Open Graph Protocol Gem to grab images related to YouTube, Vimeo, Metacafe and Dailymotion videos as well as their titles and descriptions. These images are displayed with a play button over them and when a user clicks the image it uses ajax to load and play the related video for the image.p  pAnyway Ive noticed that my page takes over 15 seconds to load now after a refresh. When I delete all the microposts that have videos images attached to them the page load times go back to normal.p  pWhen a user makes a micropost they can link to a video they want to include with the micropost and the url of that linkurl is stored in the link column of the microposts table that is setup in my DB.p  pFrom my view, I pass the link of the micropost currently being looped over into my helper method to get the open graph protocol object for video. Then from the returned object I get the image property and use an imagetag helper to display the related image.p  precodeimagetag getvideodatamicropost.link.image codepre  pstrongThis is how I communicate with open graph protocol gem.. helperstrongp  precodedef getvideodataurl   OpenGraph.fetchurl end codepre  pAnyway this all slows down my page load times dramtically. I was wondering if there is some way to fix this Im thinking the issue is caused by having to load those individual images from different URLs. I say this because when I remove the related microposts and reload my page its load time is back to normal. The images located in my app cause no issues.p  pWhen a user is posting a micropost they basically paste the link of the video they wish to add to the post in and then the image for the video is displayed back to them, they click post and the micropost is posted.p  pI was wondering if I should some how have that image uploaded to my app so I can just display images for videos like p  precodeimagetag micropost.videoimage codepre  pThis way the page will load fast as it wont need to pull images form external URLs.p  pIm not really sure how this is done by the larger websites e.g. fb, google but would like to know how and if possible be given a solution thanks.p  pKind regards.p

Negative 25430 pI have multiple versions of python installed in ubuntu precise for various reasons and uses. I have python 2.7 and python 2.6.

That will only give me commandline access straight to python2.6. but when I install some package from aptitude, it goes straight to python2.7 compatible stuff because somewhere in the OS, its sees that as the default. How should I change this p  pP.S  I know the workaround of installing from packages source code. But its not easy to get the source code always and not all are generous.p

Negative 25430 pI believe I understand the basic concepts of DI  IoC containers having written a couple of applications using them and reading a lot of stack overflow answers as well as Mark Seemans book. There are still some cases that I have trouble with, especially when it comes to integrating DI container to a large existing architecture where DI principle hasnt been really used think big ball of mud.p  pI know the ideal scenario is to have a single composition root  object graph per operation but in a legacy system this might not be possible without major refactoring only the new and some select refactored old parts of the code could have dependencies injected through constructor and the rest of the system using the container as a service locator to interact with the new parts. This effectively means that a stack trace deep within an operation might include several object graphs with calls being made back and forth between new subsystems single object graph until exiting into an old segment and traditional subsystems service locator call at some point to code under DI container.p  pWith the potentially faulty, I might be overthinking this or be completely wrong in assuming this kind of hybrid architecture is a good idea assumptions out of the way, heres the actual problemp  pLets say we have a thread pool executing scheduled jobs of various types defined in database or any external place. Each separate type of scheduled job is implemented as a class inheriting a common base class. When the job is started, it gets fed the information about which targets it should write its log messages to and the configuration it should use. The configuration could probably be handled by just passing the values as method parameters to whatever class needs them but if the job implementation gets larger than say 1020 classes, it doesnt seem very handy.p  pLogging is the larger problem. Subsystems the job calls probably also need to write things to the log and usually in examples this is done by just requesting instance of ILog in the constructor. But how does that work in this case when we dont know the details  implementation until runtime Sincep  ul liDue to non DI container controlled legacy system segments in the call chain  there potentially being multiple separate object graphs, child container cannot be used to inject the custom logger for specific subscopeli liManual property injection would basically require the complete call chain including all legacy subsystems to be updatedli ul  pA simplified example to help better perceive the problemp  precodeClass JobXImplementation  JobBase       through constructor injection     ILoggerFactory loggerFactory     JobXExtraLogic jobXExtras      public void RunJobConfig configurationFromDatabase              ILog log  loggerFactory.CreateconfigurationFromDatabase.targets          if there were no legacy parts in the call chain, I would register log as instance to a child container and Resolve next part of the call chain and everyone requesting ILog would get the correct logging targets          do stuff         jobXExtras.DoStuffconfigurationFromDatabase, log        Class JobXExtraLogic      public void DoStuffJobConfig configurationFromDatabase, ILog log           call to legacy subsystem         var old  new OldClasslog, configurationFromDatabase.SomeRandomSetting         old.DoOldStuff        Class OldClass      public void DoOldStuff           moar stuff          var old  new AnotherOldClass         old.DoMoreOldStuff        Class AnotherOldClass      public void DoMoreOldStuff           call to a new subsystem          var newSystemEntryPoint  DIContainerAsServiceLocator.ResolveltINewSubsystemEntryPointgt         newSystemEntryPoint.DoNewStuff        Class NewSubsystemEntryPoint  INewSubsystemEntryPoint      public void DoNewStuff           want to log something...       codepre  pIm sure you get the picture by this point.p  pInstantiating old classes through DI is a nonstarter since many of them use often multiple constructors to inject values instead of dependencies and would have to be refactored one by one. The caller basically implicitly controls the lifetime of the object and this is assumed in the implementations the way they handle internal object state.p  pWhat are my options What other kinds of problems could you possibly see in a situation like this Is trying to only use constructor injection in this kind of environment even feasiblep

Negative 25430 pWe are using DTOs as Data Contracts in our WCF web service.

Negative 25430 pI have a core project developed in RoR. The problem is that there are several independent projects which have this core as they based code, and then they may have new functionalities or changes in views, helpers, controllers, etc. I want that any change in the core can be tracked by these other projects. Hence, any change in the core will be replicated, or not, on the other projects. I was thinking in gemify the core project, but due to the constant changes that the other projects have, this wouldnt be the best solution is a long process too. Thats what I think. Other solution would be to separate some important code into modules. Then I can import this new features in the projects which want to use them.p  pThe core project is a pure MVC ruby on rails project.p  pWhat do you suggest for this issuep  pThanks in advance.p

Now while compiling Android source, what should I do so that the entire prebuilt folder structure of glibc gets copied to system folder and become part of part of system.img.p  pWith this when I copy the system.img to Android emulator and launch it, glibc is already present in system folder and just need to run the apps in glibc environment.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pafter I did as per Yuri mentioned in his answer I created glibc folder and copied everything into it, when I compile the code I get below output.p  precodebuildcoremain.mk490  Some files have been added to ALLPREBUILT. buildcoremain.mk491  buildcoremain.mk492  ALLPREBUILT is a deprecated mechanism that buildcoremain.mk493  should not be used for new files. buildcoremain.mk494  As an alternative, use PRODUCTCOPYFILES in buildcoremain.mk495  the appropriate product definition. buildcoremain.mk496  buildtargetproductcore.mk is the product buildcoremain.mk497  definition used in all products. buildcoremain.mk498  buildcoremain.mk499  unexpected glibc in ALLPREBUILT buildcoremain.mk500  buildcoremain.mk501  ALLPREBUILT contains unexpected files.

Negative 25430 pSo I have made a class called codeDictionarycode which inherits from a base codeIEnumerablecode and contains a member of type codeListcode. codeListcode has a codeconst unsigned intampcode member that stores and exposes its item count.p  pThis is codeDictionarycodes constructor.p  precodeDictionary  list, IEnumerablelist.Count   codepre  pI pass the codeconst unsigned intampcode from the initialised list to codeIEnumerablecode.

Negative 25430 pI am working on complicated code generation using CodeModel available in Java. I have managed to setup my unit tests in such a way so that a test generates small but functionally complete Java code which gets compiled in memory and generated classes isare loaded from memory. Everything in general is reasonably quick if I dont output generated code.p  pSince the generator code is not aware of generated classes, I use reflection to fire methods on generated class which works well. These methods also can fail as I use reflection to make sure methods did expected work by checking state of the object.p  pMy problem is I dont want to log the generated code every time test is run. But I want to see the generated code if test fails. There are lot of tests and since I use infintest, my eclipse becomes slower as infinitest keeps accumulating the output from various tests.p  pCan I set up junit so that it calls my function if test fails e.g.p  precodeboolean compileSuccessful  compile Assert.assertTrueOoops, you generated bad code, compileSuccessful codepre  pIf above assertion fails, I want to ouput generated code and see what went wrong.p

No dialog is needed, just want it to start printing the bitmap as soon as the program calls for it.p  pI made a class that could do this about 4 years ago but am having a hard time replicating my what I did back then, and the backups are missing for some reason.  Its driving me insane to ask for help on a simple problem, but probably more crazy to keep banging my head against a wall.p

Negative 25430 pThe goal is to display bitmaps stored in memory buffers.  The contents of the memory buffers are identical to diskstored .bmp files.  For performance reasons, writing these buffers to disk and then displaying them is not an option.  GDI is also not an option.  Currently, I can display 24 bit per pixel bitmaps from the memory buffers as desired.  However, when I attempt to display 8 bit per pixel bitmaps, the images display with the wrong colors i.e. figures in the image are recognizable scaling, orientation, etc are correct, but everything is the wrong color.  p  pHere is how I initialize the bitmap header structsp  precodebfh  tagBITMAPFILEHEADERbuf1 bih  tagBITMAPINFOHEADERbuf1sizeoftagBITMAPFILEHEADER rgb  RGBQUADbuf1sizeoftagBITMAPFILEHEADERsizeoftagBITMAPINFOHEADER bi.bmiColors[0]  rgb bi.bmiHeader  bih pPixels  buf1bfh.bfOffBits codepre  pThen, I have tried several different ways of creating the HBITMAP, here are a fewp  precode    ghBmp  CreateDIBitmapdcPaint, ampbih, CBMINIT, VOID  pPixels, ampbi, DIBRGBCOLORS codepre  pOrp  precodeghBmp  CreateDIBSectiondcPaint, ampbi, DIBRGBCOLORS, void ampppvBits, NULL, 0 SetDIBitsdcPaint, ghBmp, 0, bih.biHeight, pPixels, ampbi, DIBRGBCOLORS codepre  pI have also tried different parameters p  ul liNULL instead of a CPaintDC objectli liDIBPALCOLORS instead of DIBRGBCOLORSli ul  pI have dumped the contents of the memory buffers storing the .bmp file structures and verified that they are identical to diskstored .bmp files that display correctly when loaded with LoadBitmap. p  pTo emphasize, the above approach DOES WORK with 24bit per pixel images.

Moreover, I would also like to write a prebuilt particular string, as static data, here codes1code of length 5.p  pThe code above assumes C99 support for code 1 code.  The inclusion of the substructure into the bigger structure at code 2 code is, as far as I understand, not supported even by the C99 standard  but GCC accepts it.  However, at code 3 code GCC gives upp  precodeerror initialization of flexible array member in a nested context codepre  pAs a workaround, the ideal code above is so far written as the following hack, which kind of worksp  precodetypedef struct  int length int items[1]  wchararrayt typedef struct  long hash wchararrayt chars  stringt  typedef struct  int length int items[5]  wchararraylen5t typedef struct  long hash wchararraylen5t chars  stringlen5t  static union  stringlen5t a stringt b  s1       617862378,      5,  H, e, l, l, o    codepre  p...and wed use s1.b as the prebuilt stringt and never refer to s1.a, which is here only for the static declaration of s1.  However, it breaks in the newest GCC 4.8, which optimizes away parts of our code because  obviously  any loop over the codeitemscode of a codewchararraytcode can iterate only once, given that it is an array of length 1.p  pThis particular issue is fixed by giving gcc the option codefnoaggressiveloopoptimizationscode.  It can probably also be fixed by not declaring the length in codewchararraytcodes codeitems[]code array, making it a dynamic array just because.  However, this way to write code is such a hack that Id prefer a fully different way to approach the problem...p  pNote that it is all generated C code produced by PyPy, as opposed to handwritten code any change is fine, including if it requires changing the way we access the data everywhere, as long as the valid C optimizations are not prevented.p  pstrongEDITstrong replaced char[] with int[], which doesnt accept the doublequote syntax codehellocode.  This is because Im looking for a solution for any array type.p  pstrongNOT RESOLVEDstrong thanks everybody for your suggestions.  It seems there is no clean way, so I have implemented the hackish solution declaring the types k1 times, once with a flexible array int items[] and the k other times with int items[N] for the various values of N that are needed.  This requires some additional hacks e.g. not using flexible arrays for MSVC they work differently there I didnt investigate to know if exactly the same syntax would work and GCC follows what C99 says and is not happy with structs that would contain codeint items[]code as only field.  It is however happy if we add a dummy field codechar dummy[0]code...  which is not strictly C99 as far as I know...p

Negative 25430 pI have a very strange situation where a Java process seems to hang when called via ApachePHP, but OK when invoked from the command line. I spent hours debugging this, no avail. Any and all thoughts welcomep  pSituation I have a .class file without the original Java code that reads an input file, processes the read information, and writes a report on stdout. The Java code doesnt read stdin, and only writes stdout. I wrapped this in a tiny Perl script that basically just execs java cp pathtoclassfile MyJavaProgram pathtoinputfiletoprocess. That way I can invoke it from the command line for testing, this works like a charm. Next, I try to invoke this from PHP using popen, and there Java just hangs. I see the Perl process in the ps list, and Java but the Java process waits forever. Once I kill it, the webserver page continues loading but of course without the expected output that the Java process would generate.p  pWhat I tried so farp  ul liWrapping the Java process in a shell script, same behaviour. Java just hangs.li liRunning it from PHP with popen without a wrapper, same behaviour.li liStarting it from PHP with system or passthru, same behaviour.li liIn the Perl wrapper, reopening STDIN for devnull so that reading stdin immediately returns EOF, same behaviour.li liIn the Perl wrapper, reopening STDERR for devnull, same behaviour.li liIn the Perl wrapper, reopening STDOUT for devnull. Here I would expect no output as it gets discarded but still the Java process just hangs.li liIn the Perl wrapper, reopening all 3 streams for devnull. Java still hangs.li liReplacing the Java invocation in the Perl wrapper with a simple ls l bin. This works as expected the web page gets populated with the ls listing. So the problem isnt in PHP or Perl.li liStarting the Java process with a binsh c java ...... Same behaviour, Java hangs.li liIn the Perl wrapper, I dump the environment variables too, to check them. Environment seems OK.li liWhen the Java process is running, I look up the Perl wrapper invocation in the ps list, and copypaste it to the command line. Works like a charm.li liSimilarly, when the Java process is hanging, I look up the invocation in the ps list, and copypaste it to the command line. Works like a charm.li liI also verified that the the input file is readable when invoked from the web server. All above tests with the command line were run using the same user ID as the Apache user.li ul  pUnfortunately I cant replace the Java code with something thats under my control. I only have the .class file to work with. What I havent tried yet is to run this under Linux, so this still might be an OSX specific issue which would surprise me.p  pWhat the hell is going on here Any and all wild ideas appreciated.. thanksp

The composited PNG output files will be generated serverside and stored in a cloud storage service.p  pThe upper estimate of generated images per month runs into millions, so every byte counts.p  pAre there any things we could consider when creating the original pieces that will go into the composite output images that will ensure good compressibilityp  pFor example... Do colours matter Are there good and bad colour gradients in source image data that produce larger output Is heavy antialiasing good or bad Are there lossy ways to treat source images to improve PNG compressibilityp  pGenerally, are there any bytesaving tips at the point of creating the images in the first placep

It does this using the classes a hrefhttpentlib.codeplex.comSourceControllatestBlocksDataSrcDataDatabase.cs relnofollowDatabasea, a hrefhttpentlib.codeplex.comSourceControllatestBlocksDataSrcDataDatabaseConnectionWrapper.cs relnofollowDatabaseConnectionWrappera and a hrefhttpentlib.codeplex.comSourceControllatestBlocksDataSrcDataTransactionScopeConnections.cs relnofollowTransactionScopeConnectionsa.   p  pThe Database class either gets the current connection associated with the ambient transaction, wrapped by DatabaseConnectionWrapper and increments the wrappers reference counter a static member via TransactionScopeConnections.GetConnection or creates a new open connection.   When disposing the ConnectionWrapper, the reference counter is decremented and the connection is not disposed until the reference count is zero.  Thus, each Repository method can get an open connection without concern about creating multiple connections within a TransactionScope which would result in promotion to a distributed transaction. p  pIs there similar functionality within, or a preferred pattern of use with, OrmLites OrmLiteConnectionFactory or do I need to roll my own perhaps using a combination of the connection filter and OnDisposing event of the connection factoryp  pAn example of usage.

Negative 25430 pIm writing a boardgame hub as a personal project, to learndiscover more about AngularJS.p  pI tried to go for a generic implementation, so I have a generic partial that shows a square grid and a generic controller, with all actual game logic residing in a service. Ive written one such service for each boardgame Ive implemented currently 2. The one thing I cant solve in a generic manner is a cell in the grid. Depending on the game, its content may be a letter, a number, a picture, or even some quite complex HTML. I could use a getter function, that would call the service, that would assemble the HTML for each cell, but this feels really notAngularish. So I thought of defining a directive for each type of cell.

Negative 25430 pIm trying to build a project which includes a few open source third party libraries, but I want to bundle my distribution with said libraries  because I expect my users to want to use my project without an Internet connection. Additionally, Id like to leave their code 100 untouched and even leave their directory structure untouched if I can. My approach so far has been to extract the tarballs and place the entire folder in codeMyProjectlibcode, but Ive had to put codeinit.pycode in every subdirectory to be able to reference the thirdparty code in my own modules.p  pWhats the common best practice for accomplishing this task How can I best respect the apps developers by retaining their projects structure How can I make importing these libraries in my code less painfulp  pIm new to making a distributable project in Python, so Ive no clue if theres something I can do in codeinit.pycode or in codesetup.pycode to keep myself from having to type codefrom lib.appname.appname.appmodule include code and whatnot.p  pFor what its worth, I will be distributing this on OS X and possibly nix. Id like to avoid using another library e.g. codesetuptoolscode to accomplish this. Weirdly, it seems to already be installed on my system, but I didnt install it, so Ive no idea whats going on.p  pI realize that this question seems to be a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5862599691859this onea, but I dont think it is because Im asking for the best practice for the distributethethirdpartycodewithyourown approach. Please forgive me if Im asking a garbage question.p
Negative 25430 pWhen using encapsulation and emtell, dont askemprinciple properly, there should be no reason for one to ask information from an object. However, Ive ran into a situation let me know if this design itself is terrible where I have an object with a member variable pointing to a function outside of the class.p  pAt some point of my application, theres a need for my object to call the function and the function should then act based on my objects status.p  pHeres an example classp  precodetypedef voidfptrFoo class Foo      public         Foostring name, fptr function         void activate                      mfunctionthis              private         string mname         fptr mfunction  codepre  pThats the class, now the developer can use the class like sop  precodevoid printFoo sender      cout ltlt Print works ltlt endl   int mainint argc, char argv      Foo fooMy foo, ampprint     foo.activate      output Print works  codepre  pThis all works fine, but what if I want to print the name of the sender All the functions are defined outside of the class, by other developers, so theres no way to access private variables. In codeCcode, you can just use the codepartialcode keyword to add a method to an existing class. This is not possible in codeCcode though.p  pI could just ignore encapsulation and create a setter and getter for codenamecode and all other properties that might be needed by the function in the future. This is pretty terrible solution, I should basically create setter and getter for everything there is in my class, since the function can do anything to my object. Besides whats the reason of encapsulation, if Im just gonna ignore it when I want top  pAn other solution would be a struct that holds the required properties inside itp  precodestruct FooBar      string name   typedef voidfptrFooBar  void Fooactivate      FooBar fb     fb.name  mname     mfunctionfb  codepre  pBut this is not much different from not using encapsulation, and it doesnt seem like a too good solution either.

Negative 25430 pIm currently learning about different ways to emulate class inheritance C style using Javascript.

When I open the page, the dialog appears, and confirms that myCar.GetType returns Vehicle as it should. p  pI have also been reading up on the revealing module pattern, which so far I have found very useful due to its clarity. However, if I try to replace the Vehicle and Car classes shown above with the followingp  precode Prototype object var Vehicle  function      var Constructor  function         var type  Vehicle          var getType  function             return type                   return             GetType getType                    return Constructor    Constructor based on prototype var Car  function      var Constructor  function name, make            Inerit the prototype class         this.proto  new Vehicle           Private         var name  name         var make  make          var getName  function             return name                  var getMake  function             return make                   return              GetName getName,             GetMake getMake                    return Constructor  codepre  pSuddenly, it refuses to work. Now as far as I can tell with my existing JS knowledge, the new classes do exactly the same as the old ones, the difference being that the member functions are created locally and exposed to public scope in the returned object literal this method of creating classes has worked fine in my previous experiments. I dont understand where the difference lies. Im still trying to get used to many of the stranger concepts in JS strange compared to C at least.... Can anyone please explain or clarify this problem for me Other commentssuggestions about my methodology are also welcome bound to be some bad practices in there somewhere.p  pThanks all p

Negative 25430 pI run a design firm and have frequent need for Drupal development. Im looking for a bit of guidance on a Drupal workflow that will work best for my company.p  pMy experience working with Drupal developers in the past has been great for backend development, and chaotic for frontend development. Projects end up with multiple and inconsistent CSS styles, and doing quality control on the visual aspect is very timeconsuming.p  pMoreover, Im a frontend coder, and use HMTLCSSJS prototypes for all phases of projects. I would prefer if the frontend coding I do to was used by the developer instead of going to waste.p  pHowever, this workflow hasnt been compatible with Drupal dev partners so far. Because they use themes, and retrofit them to the design I give them, they arent able to use the HTMLCSSJS work I do. Moreover, I have a responsive framework that I like Foundation, and my developers want to work with the standard responsive Drupal theme Omega. I dont like Omega because it isnt fluid.p  pThen theres things like my developer telling me they cant do a carrousel that uses CSS backgroundimage, because the available Drupal carrousel modules are all based on using the HTML img tag. Does everything have to be based on modulesp  pGoing back to the HTMLCSS inconsistencies and the timeconsuming design QA, I think this comes from trying to retrofit a theme. The code is very messy and it makes it hard to target elements for styling. It also makes it impossible for me to do my own CSS changes if I want.p  pSo, in short, Im looking for a completely different design workflow, and Im looking for feedback on whether its workable in Drupal without inflating costs.p  pIs it possible in Drupal to use frontend code provided by me, throw in some PHP tags, and end up with cleanlycoded pages, instead of relying on themes Would this reduce costs because the HTMLCSSJS is provided, or would it inflate costs because its easier to use a theme Are there any security issues involved Are there update issues involved In short, whats the big advantage with working with prefab themesp  pI really, truly appreciate your comments.p

Negative 25430 pFirst of all, as I know and as I tested, Android OS basicly pauses activity when user clicks home button, and resumes activity when user comes back.

Negative 25430 pSo I have been looking at tutorials and messing with things for hours. I have my main activity which creates a map of object that it gets from the database. To avoid unnecessary database queries, I am trying to save that map using the codeonSaveInstanceStatecode method and then restore it with the codeonRestoreInstanceStatecode. I can see that it gets saved correctly using the debugger, but if I set break points in the codeonRestoreInstaceStatecode method the program never breaks. Then I thought I would just do it with the codeonCreatecode method but its not breaking there either. The program should break in both of those places when returning from a different activity rightp

Now the build numbers correctly goes into the Build bundle, but still Fixed in build is not set. I also tried with both open and closed issues with no effect.p  pAny idea what I am missingp

Negative 25430 pmy current project requires the implementation of Google StreetView. p  pThe app already exists for iOS, where everything worked pretty fine, StreetView is embedded in the view, customized with overlays and buttons and what not...it runs fast, scrolling the StreetView view is smooth, its obviously no webview...in short, its perfect.p  pNow I have to do this app for Android and I was looking all day already, but with no success. From what I found out, there is the possibility to start StreetView as a new activity, without any chance to customize it, no overlays, no buttons, just standard Google stuff. This should be pretty smooth as it is not a webview. I cant use this, as I have to customize the UI. Now I tried the webview approach and this makes everything slower and more laggy than youd expect from even Android... BUT...seems to be customizable. Still, as slow as it is, I cant imagine anyone having fun with it.p  pSo, my question is, do I have any more chances to get this working a transparent Activity on top of the StreetView Activity  please no Why does Google get it right for iOS and not for Android  The iOS SDK just got released recently, is there a chance a new one will be coming for Android soon p  pThanks for any hints, M.p

Negative 25430 pWhile writing junit tests, I cannot help but think that junit tests are suitable for classes with methods that perform a lot of business logic. That way you write test conditions to test each ifelse block.  p  pBut in an enterprise application that has got a lot of java beans, why does junit need to run against those It seems redundant to write a test case for a standard gettersetter that does not perform any logic or computation.p  pShould junit not be only for classes with business logic and not plain POJOsp

For instance, within range B5B100, I want to copy and paste the B cells to another worksheet  and their companion row cells in columns J and M  when the B cell of the row in question is nonblank. And instead of having blank columns in the worksheet2, I need the results to paste neatly into columns A,B,C.p  pFor example, lets say there are only two nonblank cells in the worksheet1 range B5B100  cells B26 and B78. Running the range macro would then copy B26, J26, M26 and B78, J78, and M78 then paste them into the second worksheet starting at A2 to allow for header row and without blank rows so B26 to A2, J26 to B2, M26 to C2 and B78 to A3, J78 to B3, and M78 to C3. p  pI was able to do a nonblank copy and paste of jsut the b column values but lost as to picking up the other needed cells for each row.p  pThanksp

I admit that I am a bit of a novice with ImageIO. My thinking is that I just add the profile to the header and whatever is used to render the image should find the profile and display the image in the associated colorspace if supported. Am I missing something else that I should be doing to this imagep  pAlso  I would like to be clear that I want to use only ImageIO and not ColorConvertOp from JAI because JAI hasnt been developed in 7 years and the best way to do this is with standard JDK classes, in my opinion.

Negative 25430 pI would like to know if it would be somehow possible to handle a Serial.println on an Arduino uno without holding up the main program. p  pBasically, Im using the arduino to charge a 400V capacitor and the main program is opening and closing the gate on a MOSFET transistor for 15 and 20 microseconds respectively. I also have a voltage divider connected to the capacitor which I use to measure the voltage on the capacitor when its being charged with the Arduino. I use analogRead to get the raw value on the pin, multiply the value by the required ratio and try to print that value to the serial console at the end of each cycle. The problem is, though, that in order for the capacitor to charge quickly, the delays need to be very small in the range of microseconds and the serial print command takes much longer than that to execute and therefore holds up the entire program. p  pMy question therefore is wherther it would somehow be possible to get the command to execute on something like a different thread without holding up the main cycle. Is the 8bit AVR capable of doing something like thisp  pThanksp

Negative 25430 pIve written a good chunk of code that relies heavily on both inheritances and composition. Now ive run into a problem where my hierarchy classes need variables to be shared to work between each other, but that causes the composited classes to be shared too, meaning my separate instances of these classes will share values where i dont want them to. I obviously suck at explaining this with words so i wrote some code.p  precodeclass Firstobject     def initself         self.subvar1  0         self.subvar2  10  class Secondobject     variable3  First  class ThirdSecond     def initself         self.variable4  self.variable3.subvar2  Firstinstance  Third Secondinstance  Third  Firstinstance.variable3.subvar1  50 Secondinstance.variable3.subvar2  0  print Firstinstance.variable3.subvar2 ltprints 0 but i want 10 print Secondinstance.variable3.subvar1 ltprints 50 but i want 0 codepre  pExcept for dumping the hierarchy system and writing one massive class where i can prevent composited classes from having their valued shared, is there any other way for me to work around thisp

Negative 25430 pI just started VHDL coding, and right now have to code a BCD to 7 segment decoder. I am doing a Behavioral designits required but right now I am having trouble on how to code the display.p  pI know how to code this decoder with just one input and one output, however we have a second output called DIGENL which is used as our display. It is an active low bus output that enables each digit of the 7segment display on our board.p  pHe told us to just program it to 01110 so the fourth digit is always on and the other three are off.p  pI do not know how to code DIGENL into my code, and do not know what the above statement actually means code wise.

Negative 25430 pIm working on iOS app that performs some calculations with an array of thousand objects. The objects have properties with x and y coordinates, velocity for x and y axises and couple other xy properties. There is some math to calculate an interaction between physical objects represented by objects in the array. The math is pretty straight forward, basically it is calculation of the forces applied to the objects, speed and change in position x,y for each objects. I wrote a code using regular  scalar math in Objective C, it worked fine on iPhone 5s, however too slow on other devices like iPhone 4, 4s, 5 and iPad mini. I found that the most time consuming operations were the calculations of the distance between 2 points and calculations of the length of a vector like shown below which involves taking a square rootp  precodefloat speed  sqrtfself.dynamic.speedx,2powself.dynamic.speedy,2 codepre  pSo, I had to do something to make the calculations quicker. I rewrote the code to make the properties with the coordinates of the objects and such properties as velocity which were presented by X and Y components to be vectors of GLKVector2 type. I was hoping that it would make the calculations of the variables like the distance between 2 vectors or points, as per my understanding, addition and subtraction of vectors significantly faster due to using special vector functions like GLKVector2Distance, GLKVector2Normalize,GLKVector2Add etc. However, it didnt help too much in terms of performance, because, as I believe, to put the object with properties of GLKVector2 type to the array I had to use NSValue, as well as to decode the GLKVector2 values back from the object in the array to perform vector calculations. Below is the code from calculation method in objects implementationp  precodeGLKVector2 currentPosition [self.currentPosition getValueampcurrentPosition] GLKVector2 newPosition    calculations with vectors. Result is in newPosition.  self.currentPosition  [NSValue valueampnewPosition withObjCTypeencodeGLKVector2] codepre  pMoreover, when I rewrote the code to use GLKVector2, I got memory warnings and after some time of running the applications sometimes crashes.p  pI spend several days trying to find a better way to do the calculations faster, I looked at vecLib, openGL, but have not found a solution that would be understandable for me. I have a feeling that I might have to look at writing code in C and integrate it somehow into objective C, but I dont understand how to integrate it with the array of objects without using NSValue thousands times.p  pI would greatly appreciate it if anyone could help with advise on what direction should I look at Maybe there is some library available that can be easily used in Objective C with group of objects stored in arraysp

Negative 25430 pIm using nearlyfreespeech.net as a web host, and I got tired of having to manage 3 sites for 3 subdomains on my website, so I was looking into how to serve all 3 from one site.p  pEach site is a shortname.nfshost.com domain, and can have an alias for a subdomain or domain. For example.com and sub.example.com, I would normally make two sites, examplewww and examplesub I try to make the short names clear, and set www.example.com and example.com as aliases to examplewww, and sub.example.com as alias to examplesub, then point cname DNS record for the names to shortname.nfshost.com. p  pMy solution was to make one site as PHP since they charge more for PHP than for static, with the following p  precodeltphp site  SERVER[HTTPHOST]   if site  example.com      includewww.example.com.php  If domain is example.com, serve that page    elseif site  sub.example.com      includesub.example.com.php if domain is sub.example.com, serve that page instead    elseif site  www.example.com      headerLocation httpexample.com redirects www to nowww    else      headerLocation httpexample.com dont let browser go to examplewww.nfshost.com  gt codepre  pThe 2 included PHP files are bootstrapthemed, with CDN links for the CSSimages bootstrap cdn, my own static site that I call a CDN which has a complicated htaccess redirect and folders separated by site, so each site I manage can have their own images, and besides the 404 error page also bootstrap, these are the only files on the server index, sub.example.com include, www.example.com include, 404.p  pI am able to have PHP code run within the included PHP files without a problem, and even have them include other files. The output looks normal HTML, looks valid.p  pI was able to use one CMS platform, after a few glitches setting the baseurl by including the CMSs index as index2.php, and I sortof got a thing working where I can deny directories if the site doesnt match sub.example.comfolder I can return 404 if coming from www.example.com.p  pstrongQuestionstrong are there any problems with this I feel like Im making it overly complicated, I dont know PHP very well, and I dont know if theres a problem with this that I cant think of. p  pI also think that if this solution was this easy, I would have seen it somewhere in my many Google searches, which makes me think its not that good of a solution. Is there any reason not to make it this complicatedp  pIm not worried about downtime, or anything like that. Besides my own visits, my site gets maybe 3 people visit a month, according to Google Analytics, and its mostly contact info but I have a few php scripts to show information, so Id need to have php for all 3 subdomains, which gets to be a little more expensive with nearlyfreespeech.p

Negative 25430 pI want to implement a user guide in my app. But its not clear to me, what would be the best solution to do that. My idea for user guide based on a html faq, where user guide is a separate activity that has a table of contents at the top followed by the actual guide. The each item from table of contents is a link to a specific anchor in user guide. And the acitivty would have a backtotop button. My question is, how should i implement all those features Should i work with typical View subclasses or should i try to implement a html document with a webview Ive never worked with webrelated APIs so i dont know if it possible to implement an offlane html documentp  pEdit lesson learned. From now on i publish questions only about specific coding problems.p  pP.s. maybe anyone can suggest a site where you can discuss more general questions and suggestionsp

Negative 25430 pI need to create a database which allow for easy manual entry of data as well as linking to SQL databases I have access to. This is something Ive been researching and trying to design by myself for a while now. Everytime I think I have a solution I begin to have doubts that this is the right direction. I would really REALLY appreciate your helpinput.p  pstrongMy current workflow and nightmare.strongbr I work in IT and Im responsible for reporting for my own group but it has been and will continue to expand across many groups across the whole IT organization. Each group has their own reporting tool with some that can export data cleanlyconsistently, others that have to input data manually and a few which I can access the SQL database directly but havent yet.p  pTo create a monthly report I have a master workbook with graphs that reference data in multiple data collection workbooks. In these data collection workbooks I have the raw data which either myself or the teamservice owners inputs each month. From that raw data I may create a pivot table to get the data I want and then in each one of the collection workbooks I have a reference tab. In this reference tab I have a formula that is a rolling 13 months in the first column which say goes from Jan 2013 to Jan 2014. The months are calculated by referencing a cell that has the current reporting month in it. So for this example its Jan 2014. When you change that cell to the next month say Feb 2014 it will roll that first column so that those same cells now go from Feb 2013 to Jan 2014. the columns to the right of this column reference either the data table directly or the pivot tables using vlookups or getpivotdata formulas that reference the month cell to the left and grabs data accordingly. a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu14628356NETWORKDATA.xlsx relnofollowHere is an example of a collection workbook.ap  pAs you can see this can be a very manual and tedious workflow with many points where this could be improved. One major issue is the fact that each teamgroup doesnt pull data from the same tool and doesnt serve it up in the right format. I sometimes have to write a vba script to take the raw data and add helper data like a column with the correctly formatted 02012014 format so it works in pivot tables correctly instead of multiple entries with different days ie. 02052014 02232014.p  pstrongThe end goal  where I want to bestrongbr I want to create a database where I can link SQL databases directly to it as well as making it easy for a team to manually input data by reading in a csv or xls file of data. The crux again is that Im only one person and I want to offload as much as the data entry to each one of those teamsgroups without making it a difficult task.p  pUsing the master sheet to create a monthly report has some great results but I would like this to be a web accessible and dynamic dashboard. Im a pretty good front end dev with knowledge of HTML, CSSLESS and some JSSQL knowledge. I will have support of a senior web developer if I can proceed with this project. I just need help in working out the data collectionstoragequerying portion of this.p  pIf you got this far thank you so much for reading about my problem. If I wasnt clear about something or you have more questions for me please feel free to ask.p  pTHANKSp

Negative 25430 pTo make a short story long, I was looking at a performance problem in my 32bit iPhone app.  In the process I removed the 3rdparty library that was limiting me to 32bit and when I built for arm64 I saw a 2fold speed improvement in a section of code unrelated to said library.p  pI was under the impression that simply adding arm64 to the Valid Architectures was not going to bring a significant increase in performance so I wonder if my case is just an anomaly.p  pIn the process of whittling my app down to a few dozen lines that show the performance difference I lost some of the gain, but its still significant.  Seemingly minor changes like the number of characters in dictionary keys and the mix of the number of objects in the keys make a big difference.p  pThe following code is the entirety of the sample app  placed in viewDidLoad.   Built with arm64 using Xcode 5.1, running on my iPhone 5s iOS 7.1 average time to retrieve 2075 dictionary objects is about 0.6 secs, built armv7s, about 1.0 secs.  p  pIs there a simple explanation to the performance improvement that can be exploited in generalp  precodedefine NUMDICTENTRIES 2075 NSMutableDictionary aDict  [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init] NSDictionary keyDictionary for int i  0 i lt NUMDICTENTRIES i      if arc4randomuniform2          keyDictionary  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys                          [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString], entry,                          [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString], category, nil]      else          keyDictionary  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys                          [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString], entry,                          [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString], category,                          [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString], article, nil]          NSDictionary d  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString],xyzzy, nil]     [aDict setObjectd forKeykeyDictionary]   define NUMITERATIONS 10  NSTimeInterval runTime  0  for int i  0 i lt NUMITERATIONS i      NSDate start  [NSDate date]      for NSDictionary keyDictionary in aDict          [[aDict objectForKeykeyDictionary] objectForKeyxyzzy]           runTime  [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDatestart]   NSLogaverage of d iterations  f, NUMITERATIONS, runTimeNUMITERATIONS codepre

Negative 25430 pIve got a big complicated SPA that Im coding in angular. In it, I need to keep track of actual Model data  operationalized as stuff that I get from and send to the backend API server. I also have viewstate data  stuff I keep track of, but dont send to the API server. Model data is stuff like user nicknames or forum post bodies, whereas viewstate data is this particular UI element is expanded  its application state basically.p  pWhat Im wondering is is there a bestpractices approach to this In my more complicated controllers, Ive got an ngrepeat of elements, each element has expandoUI elements. The temptation is to put those expandos inside an ngif and attach a .showing variable to the object. For example one could imagine this kind of text codengrepeatuser in users, ngclickuser.showing  user.showing, ngifuser.showingcode in a few divs. This is really handy because all the information we need about the view state of a repeated item is right there on the repeat.p  pThis also smells terrible  it potentially overwrites fields that were fetched from the API server, and since I cache data models to save on API roundtrips and handle realtime updates, it also means that view state gets preserved when the user navigates away and then back to the same place in the SPA, or that the view state would be linked in the event the same data is displayed twice on the screen say, the same profile is showing in three places on the screen as three replies to a post.p  pIve got some ideas about what to do here. I could encapsulate all the view state variables in their own place in the controller, which has the sideeffect of making ngrepeats a lot harder to pull off you have to look up the view state variable using the index property probably.p  pI could encapsulate this one problem in a directive, calling ngrepeat on the directive, which would itself have isolate scope and only has one set of state variables to track so it therefore doesnt need to worry about tracking complex view state.p  pI could do something else entirely that the SO community suggests.p  pIm leaning toward the directive route. This seems like the Angular Way of doing things. Each UI element doesnt really need to share its state outside of itself, I am currently only really doing this because my initial web mockups were big HTML templates that I got and then attached ngrepeat directives to. I can break the Post, Comment, Author, and so on elements into directives, then they just keep their state on their own.p

Negative 25430 pI have two separate programs running at one time.p  pOne of the programs is a virtual keyboard that causes keyboard presses when you click that respective letter on the GUI.  It uses SendInput to make the keyboard commands and is coded in C.p  pThe other program is a game that takes in the physical keyboard presses as input, and I can change this code to whatever it needs to be to read inputs from the virtual keyboard.  This is coded in C.p  pRight now, when both programs are running, the virtual keyboard can type things in notepad, but the game program doesnt respond to these inputs.  However, the game program can respond to physical keyboard presses.p  pIm wondering if I could see what keyboard commands were sent through SendInput so that the game program can read it.  For example, if I press the up arrow on the virtual keyboard, the code in the game can use some function to detect that an up arrow command was issued.p

Negative 25430 pIve currently got an app that has high throughput and Im using httpClient 4.3.3 provided by Apache themselves. I have an issue where I keep getting an InterruptedIOException after a while. The cause is a ConnectionShutdownException. Im wondering if anyone has any insight on why this would happen.p  pIve tracked down that the error is being thrown in the CPoolProxy line 135. It seems like the getConnection call fails due to the fact that the poolEntry used to create the CPoolEntry is null.p  pNow I do have a thread that cleans up the expired and timeout connections and timeouts are set for the connectionssockets. Im at a loss right now.

Negative 25430 pstrongSummarystrong I want to remove duplicate subviews in my custom table view cells. My old video player view and buttons in my custom table view cells appear all the time after I scroll the tableview. I do want to remove the old video view and buttons appear again and again.p  pstrongWhat I didstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8B6km.png altStoryImagep  ol liI used storyboard in my project and made custom tableview cell to fill whole screen size. li liI set self.tableview.pagingEnabled  YES. li liI used ReactiveCocoa, Parse.com and SCRecorderfor playing video like Vine in this snippet of code.li liI created IBOutlet for each subviews in my custom UITableViewCell in my custom tableviewCell class called MainViewCell. The tableview controller that used this custom tableviewCell is called MainViewController.li ol  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pOk. I admit this should be a pretty easy problem. But I could not solve this even though I searched and applied all of the ways through google and stack overflow so far.My tableview cell creates subviews over and over again.p  pstrongMy Hypothesisstrongp  pFirst of all, my main hypothesis for creating another videoPlayerview was that reusing cells create another playback view over and over again while they are reused.p  ol liReusing cell will create another SCVideoPlayerViewVideoPlayerView again.li ol  pSo, I tried to make nil the videoPlayerview in prepareForReuse like thisp  precodevoidprepareForReuse      [super prepareForReuse]     self.buyButton  nil     self.moreButton  nil     self.messageButton nil     self.usernameButton  nil     self.videoPlayerView  nil  codepre  pWhen I do this, way more weird thing happens. The underlying view exist and the new views was removed which was not what I wanted.p  pAnd when I remove videoPlayerview when the cell is not nil in the MainViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath, When I do this, the view itself completely removed. I also tried this in voidtableViewUITableView tableView didEndDisplayingCellUITableViewCell cell1 forRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath. but, it shows same behavior. p  pI also tried to remove the sublayer which is strong, nonatomic, readwrite AVPlayerLayer  playerLayer in the SCVideoPlayerView class in prepareForReuse by using removeFromSuperLayer method. When I did this, it crashed my application. p  pFor the buttons, I set the buttons as nil in the prepareForReuse method. But it also remove the new views, not old view.

Negative 25430 pI have two spreadsheets.  One of them is about 20000 rows of patients entering an emergency room.  Each row has a datetime column, along with separate date and separate time columns.  Clearly multiple patients enter on the same day.  The other spreadsheet has 366 dates and times of sunrises and sunsets for each day covered in the first spreadsheet.p  pWhat I want to do is create a column in the first spreadsheet called isnight and code each entry as a 0 if its daytime i.e. the time the patient entered is greater than the time of sunrise and less than the time of sunset corresponding to the patients day of entry, and as a 1 if its nighttime the else conditionp  pWhat would be the simplest way to go about doing this  Doing time comparison is a pain in Excel and Python is giving me issues with parsing.

It holds when it reaches its limit and then on mouseup it quickly fades out.p  pSince I could easily see the code behind the second example I tried implementing it in a similar fashion as it had but with the exception of using touch events instead of click since I wanted it to hold the effect if all i did was touch but not release. p  pI tried scaling, transitioning the position setting the opacity but getting the placement and the effect of radiating outwards from the point of touch was beyond me or at least from the time Ive invested so far. In truth Im just under experienced in the animation department in general.p  pAny thoughts on how to implement itp

Negative 25430 pIm facing a very strange issue in a hrefhttpdocs.frozenmountain.comwebsync4 relnofollowfm.websynca, behind Cyberroam connection. p  pThis library connects to a websockets and onRecieve handler of that channel, recieves messages from server.p  pOn any usual network, the websocket connection HTTP101 request remains persistent and Im able to recieve messages.p  pBehind the firewall, the javascript code reaches the onSuccess handler of channel subscribe, bud no messages are recieved. On inspecting the chrome browser tab, I observe that the websocket connection request got to completed state instead of being in pending state forever. p  pI realize that this is some issue with the firewall, and this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2201317whydontcurrentwebsocketclientimplementationssupportproxiesquestiona addresses it, but I was wondering if theres any approach to programmatically determine this state. Basically, to switch to http polling if websocket is not running properly.p  pOne solution I could think of is to keep a global flag and set it to true in onRecieve handler. And also init a timeout function23s before channel subscribe to verify if flag is true, otherwise fallback. Im looking forward to a neater and timeindependentlag indepentent approach. p

Negative 25430 pIm not clear on what goes on behind the scenes of a dictionary lookup.  Does key size factor into the speed of lookup for that keyp  pCurrent dictionary keys are between 1020 long, alphanumeric.p  pI need to do hundreds of lookups a minute.p  pIf I replace those with smaller key IDs of between 1 amp 4 digits will I get faster lookup times  This would mean I would need to add another value in each item the dictionary is holding.  Overall the dictionary will be larger.  p  pAlso Ill need to change the program to lookup the ID then get the URL associated with the ID.  p  pAm I likely just adding complexity to the program with little benefitp

Negative 25430 pI have a list of files codeListltstringgt Filescode in my Cbased WPF application.p  pcodeFilescode contains 1,000,000 unique file paths.p  pI ran a profiler on my application. When I try to do parallel operations, its REALLY laggy because its IO bound. It even lags my UI threads, despite not having dispatchers going to them note the two lines Ive marked downp  precodeFiles.AsParallel.ForAllx gt      char[] buffer  new char[0x100000]     using FileStream stream  new FileStreamx, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read  EXTREMELY SLOW     using StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderstream, true              while true                      int bytesRead  reader.Readbuffer, 0, buffer.Length  EXTREMELY SLOW             if bytesRead lt 0                              break                             codepre  pThese two lines of code take up 70 of my entire profile test runs. I want to achieve maximum parallelization for IO, while keeping performance such that it doesnt cripple my apps UI entirely. There is nothing else affecting my performance. Proof Using codeFiles.ForEachcode doesnt cripple my UI, and codeWithDegreeOfParallelismcode helps out too but, I am writing an application that is supposed to be used on any PC, so I cannot assume a specific degree of parallelism for this computation also, the PC I am on has a solidstate hard disk. I have searched on StackOverflow, and have found links that talk about using asynchronous IO read methods. Im not sure how they apply in this case, though. Perhaps someone can shed some light Also how can you tune down the constructor time of a new FileStream is that even possiblep  pstrongEditstrong Well, heres something strange that Ive noticed...the UI doesnt get crushed so bad when I swap Read for ReadAsync while still using AsParallel. Simply awaiting the task created by ReadAsync to finish causes my UI thread to maintain some degree of usability. I think this does some sort of asynchronous scheduling that is done in this method to maintain optimal disk usage while not crushing existing threads. And on that note, is there ever a chance that the operating system contends for existing threads to do IO, such as my applications UI thread strongI seriously dont understand why its slowing my UI threadstrong. Is the OS scheduling work from IO on my thread or something Did they do something to the CLR to eat threads that havent been explicitly affinated using codeThread.BeginThreadAffinitycode or something Memory is not an issue I am looking at Task Manager and there is plenty.p

Negative 25430 pIm working on essentially a WYSIWYG designer that allows the enduser to pick colors via [input typecolor] fields. This interface has the inputs on the left side and on the right side is an iframe pointing to the generated preview. Typically, when an input is clicked and the color is changed, it calls function strongupdatestrong bound by a backbone view via emchangeem event on the input field. This update function then changes the CSS values in the iFrame for purposes of live preview. This is working fine. p  pHowever, I am building a unit test page that is essentially testing that changing an input field to a certain color will indeed change the color in the preview. Essentially this Change input to PINK. Did that inputs corresponding CSS selector on the preview change to PINKp  pThe structure of the unit test page is that the designer is loaded in via an iFrame.

Negative 25430 pWe have a website with multiple cards, which can contain different types of content images, text, iframes, pdf. When there are multiple cards with iframes it slows down the page a lot. The entire page freezes while it is loading the iframes. It doesnt matter if the iframe are loading as long as you can scroll around on the page. But you cant do anything until all iframes are loaded, which is the problem.p  pI tried some solutions that I found while Googling, for example loading the iframes with javascriptjquery when the page has finished loading. This kinda works, as in, the entire page loads fast, but then after the main page is done loading, the iframes start loading and the freezes the entire website so that you cant do anything.p  precodewindow.onload  preloader function preloader      .loadIframe.eachfunctioni, obj          var datasrc  this.attrdatasrc         this.attrsrc, datasrc          codepre  pAs you can see in the code above, all my iframes have the class codeloadIframecode with codedatasrccode having the url to load. p  pWhat I want to achieve the main page loads, than the iframes load maybe one by one while you can still scroll around on the main page.p

Negative 25430 pIm writing two applications that need to be able to pass data back and forth over the internet.  I understand how to read and write using JSON objects, but am now wondering what the best way to pass this data isp  pI have an apache server setup and I tried to simply write to a file in my publichtml folder using my server URL, but obviously java doesnt let you write to files over URL so Im a bit stuck now.p  pIs there anyway to do this without having to write my own server  p  pstrongMore explanation in case my question is confusingstrongp  pI have java application A running on machine A and application B running on machine B.p  pI want to be able to write a Json Objectp  precodetestStringhelloWorld codepre  pfrom Machine A, and have the application on machine B read this object.p  pI tried using a BufferedWriter to write to a hrefhttpMyServerURL.comMyJsonFile.txt relnofollowhttpMyServerURL.comMyJsonFile.txta This gives me an error as I cant write to a URLp  pI can however read from the file using a URL and data input stream, so if theres some other way to allow java to write to a file over URL, I already know how to do the reading.p

Negative 25430 pI have a client that wants two custom nav menus stacked on top of one another and under a slider with their logo in the center. They also want the menus to be fixed upon scroll. I have executed this and it works amazingly. Here is the link... a hrefhttpwww.jshuadvd.comdin8 relnofollowDEMOap  pNow here lies the conundrum. Although this looks great on any device over 1200px, for the life of me I am not able to figure out how to make this look great for devices below that. I have added media queries to almost all of the code and still noting. I have made everything else on the page responsive except for this. Maybe removing the fixed menu is an option for smaller devices Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here is the code.... BTW I know the code is sloppy and in abundance, any suggestions to clean it up are welcome....p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idnavcontainergt  ltdiv idnavbox classanimated fadeInDowngt  lta

Friendly person, but very strict on, not passing over any developer support number or even accept feature requests or redirecting to some who would do so, so dead end.p  pI bought a QX100 and I really love the idea, but its implementation has just to many limits. The camera store said it sold very bad, which is sad.

Negative 25430 pI am trying to build an online judge for programming problems like a hrefhttpuva.onlinejudge.org relnofollowUVA OJa. When programs are judged, their efficiency i.e. how fast they can process test inputs need to be tested.

Moreover, some programs may get more CPU when the traffic is low, and some programs may get less due to high traffic, which is unfair.p  pSo I was wondering, is there a way to measure program efficiency regardless of which CPU it is running on Maybe with some CPU cycle calculations or something like thatp  pNotep  ol liI am using PHP on the server side.li liI can use Linux commands in the server.li liI can request Linux programs to be installed in the server.li liI think I can limit memory usage to a process which deals with memory efficiency, but I dont know how to limit CPU usage.

Right now Azure Table Storage, HBase and Cassandra seems to be the most promising options.p  ul li1 billion entitiesli liup to 100 reads per second, though caching will mostly make it much lessli liaround 10  50 writes per secondli ul  pStrong consistency would be a plus, so perhaps HBase would be better than Cassandra in that regard.p  pQuerying will often be done on a secondary inmemory database with various indexes in addition to ElasticSearch or Windows Azure Search for fulltext search and perhaps some filtering.p  pAzure Table Storage looks like it could be nice, but from what I can tell, the big difference between Azure Table Storage and HBase is that HBase supports updating and reading values for a single property instead of the whole entity at once. I guess there must be some disadvantages to HBase however, but Im not sure what they would be in this case.p  pI also think crate.io looks like it could be interesting, but I wonder if there might be unforseen problems.p  pAnyone have any other ideas of the advantages and disadvantages of the different databases in this case, and if any of them are really unsuited for some reasonp

Negative 25430 pIm getting mad with the Kendo grid. In my ASP.NET MVC project I use a database that contains archive values with a UTC datetime. I want to show these values on my page, but I need the datetime values to be shown as local browser context datetime. I also do have two JQuery datepickers for the startend datetime selection of the desired range that must also work with local time. These two datepickers modify the filters of the grid on each change.p  pI already managed to change the filters datetime to UTC by using this code when the datepickers values changep  precodevar filterExists  false .eachfilter, function index, entry      if entry.field  DateValue ampamp entry.operator  lte          entry.value  EndDate.toISOString         filterExists  true         console.logUTCEndDate   EndDate.toISOString       if filterExists  false      filter.push field DateValue, operator lte, value EndDate.toISOString   codepre  pWhen I look into the POST request, the start and end datetimes get send as UTC.p  pNow the controller fetches the data from the DB like thisp  precodepublic ActionResult JournalData[DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest request      JsonResult jsonNetResult  new JsonResult  JsonRequestBehavior  JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet      var JournalData  db.DoubleDataValueArchive.ToDataSourceResultrequest, x gt new JournalEventModel              DateValue  x.DateValue,         StationId  x.StationId,         Value  x.Value,           jsonNetResult.Data  JournalData     return jsonNetResult  codepre  pUsing this code, the data gets returned to the grid in UTC. The data is shown in the grid, but the datetimes dont match the values in the datepickers which show the local datetime.p  pAs I could not figure out a way to convert these datetimes to local time in the grid itself, I tried converting it to local time in the controller by usingp  precodeDateValue  x.DateValue.ToLocalTime, codepre  pin the code shown before. But now the grids datetime filter values dont match. Now, when I want to show data for e.g. the last two hours, the most recent hour is not shown when the clients time is UTC1. This is extremely annoying and I dont know how to resolve this issue.p  pAs far as I can see, sending and returning datetimes to and from the server in UTC would be the most stable way. All conversion should be done on client side and not on the server. It seems that the grid can not work with UTC under the hood and display local time whereever it gets rendered on the page.p  pI hope that somebody ran into this issue before. Thanks for your helpp

Negative 25430 h3Prefaceh3  pThe answer to this question may very well be because the creators of JavaScript decided so.  Mostly Im just curious if theres a specific reasoning behind this decision, aside from mere consistency with other identifiersvariable names and other languages.p  h3Questionh3  pThis is legal p  precodevar foo   1abc bar, 1 lol  document.writefoo[1abc] document.writefoo[1] codepre  pLines 23 of this are not legal p  precodevar foo   1abc bar, 1 lol  document.writefoo.1abc document.writefoo.1 codepre  pI have not used a language where identifiers can start with a number, but until JavaScript, I also have not used a language where dictionary values could be referenced using both codedict[index]code and codedict.indexcode syntax.p  pIm not sure if dictionary keys are considered identifiers or not.  If they are, then this question is a nobrainer.p  pThen again, Im not really clear why JavaScript identifiers cant start with a number, given that numbers are a Number type.  In other languages e.g. C numbers have types like codeintcode, codelongcode, codedoublecode, etc causing code5Lcode or code5Dcode to specify 5 as long and 5 as double respectively.  So, in theory, JavaScript identifiers emcouldem start with a number, and be fine I think.p  pC p  precodevar x  5L  x is long type var y  5D  x is double type codepre  pJavaScript p  precodevar x  5L  syntax error var y  5D  syntax error codepre  pSo, my guess is that JavaScript identifiers cant start with a number for consistency with other languages, and JavaScript dictionary keys cant be referenced with codedict.123code syntax for consistency with other JavaScript identifiers.  Is this the only reasonp

So I used this example from MSDN a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comdedelibrarybb979228.aspxID0E3BAC relnofollowMSDN UDP Documentationap  h1Problemh1  pNow here is what I cant understand. When I use the Node.js client the server receives a message from the port I defined in Node.js 3001. When I use the C Client the port seems to be random.

The routine I have that read the property from disk codegetVarOnFilecode I do not have access to the implementation, but it uses a pointer to the type to fill the value on the file. p  pIn the documentation it says that if the property does not exists, the pointer may be null, although I am unsure if it will set it to null or it is because it expects that I enter null pointer to the function. p  pBecause of that, instead of using the codedestVarcode pointer itself, I use a codelocalVarcode pointer, and then set the codedestVarcode to codelocalVarcode.p  pBut I am not sure if I should do that, it seems that this will segment memory, where most of the members are close in the memory, but not this one that I set to the memory place reserved by the file.p  precodevoid readHelperconst char propOnFile, floatamp destVar     check if propOnFile exists   float localVar  nullptr    getFileOnVarpropOnFile,localVar   if  localVar  nullptr     destVar      class MyClass    private     float prop   public     static MyClass readconst char file       readHelperprop,ampthisgtprop       codepre  pI am not sure what would happen to the original memory place reserved for the original class property member, which was replaced to a new place.

Negative 25430 pIm trying to compile some files on a recent GCC, on a x8664 host. The code was originally compiled on a i586 32bit host, using GCC 3.4.3. For some reason, I get error messages when trying to codeldcode part of the code, and I dont know what else to try.p  pTo be able to compile the code, I added some relevant flags e.g., codem32code for GCC, codem elfi386code for LD.

Are there other GCCLD options I should use to ensure this backwards compatibility Or tools similar to codereadelfcode which might provide more information about itp  pstrongExtra informationstrongp  pI tried comparing the object files produced in both versions, using codenmcode and codereadelfcode.p  pComparing with codenmcode, only a few symbol locations are different, and the differences are minor e.g., an address code430code in the original .o became code460code in the new one, certainly very distant from 32bit boundaries. Actually, in most cases the code produced by the new GCC has smaller offsets than the original code.p  pComparing with codereadelfcode, there are also some differences between both versions, but again, nothing close to 32bit boundaries. In particular, the symbols codebarcode mentioned in the error messages have the same exact offset in both versions.p

So you enter how much ore you want and it will do the math, It will tell you how much wood you will need and how long it will be.  I want to send them a local notification when the ore will be done cooking. SO i need a way to find what time it will be after the unknown amount of time for the ore to be done.p  pThis is the code to find how long before the ore is done.p  precodetimeAmount  oreWanted  11 codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjpmmE.png altenter image description here And after you start the timer I want it to find the date and time when it will be done, so it will notify the user. I tried just having a basic timer and when it reached 0 it did a local notification, but the app couldnt be closed because the timer would stop. I need a way so the app can be completely closed and still notify them.

Negative 25430 pAfter doing some research here and elsewhere, and trying a few troubleshooting attempts, I come to you good folks for help.p  pIn SQL Server 2012, I have a job, with currently only one step.  That step goes something like this p  precode    EXEC msdb.dbo.spsenddbmail        profilename  SomeProfile,        recipients  MyEmailAddresssomeplace.com,        subject  Some Subject,        query  NSELECT somedata FROM sometable WHERE something  true,        attachqueryresultasfile  1,        queryattachmentfilename  WeeklyData.txt codepre  pOn the General tab of the job, I have the owner as the GodMode sql user.  Should have unlimited privileges.  p  pOn the step, the Run As dropdown is empty.  I have no idea how to change this.p  pIn the above step code, the profilename, I have tried two things.  When I did a send a test message attempt using Database Mail in Management Studio, all works well, and the user it used was, well say, USERX.  I set up Database mail wizard with, well say, USERY.  I have tried changing the profilename to USERX and USERY with no apparent differences.p  pHere is the error Im getting.  Its confusing because I havent knowingly asked it to use this user  Executed as user NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM. profile name is not validp  pIve tried a few things.  In Profile Security under Database Mail wizard, the only user visible is USERX the one the test successfully used to send mail, as outlined above.  USERY does not show up.  I tried in Database Mail wizard, under View Change etc Account, tinkering around there.  The only user that shows up here is USERY  No USERX  Im very confused.  I tried setting USERY SMTP auth to windows, basic, and Anonymous to no avail.  p  pI read that you need to set up in Profile Security the various users like NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM but that doesnt show up either, and neither does NETWORK.  p  pAny suggestions are most welcome and desperately appreciated.p  pEDIT AHA  USERX is a PROFILE, USERY is an ACCOUNT...both are fine.  The test email was using the USERX profile under USERY account.  So I guess I need to set USERX as the profilename but that does not resolve the problem.  It still uses NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM for some reason.  p

Thanks for the help Ive updated the code. p  pWhat I want to do is rename the labels with a label from codenameForLabelscode array. This works for the first label but then I receive the following error codeTypeError labels[i] is undefinedcodep  pThis is happening because codelabelscode never exceeds the length of 1, I think it gets rewritten every time rather than get written to the next position in the array. How come codexcode never goes higher than 0 p  pWhat I would like to see is all the labels in the codelabelscode array get changed to those that are in the codenameForLabelscode array. For example the label in codelabels[0]code would become codeAuthor 1code, and codelabels[1]code would become codeAuthor 2code and so on.p  pEdit 2 HTML example addedp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv styledisplay block idauthorView classformhorizontalgt     ltdiv idauthor0 classformgroupgt         ltdiv classcolsm4 controllabelgtltlabel class forauthor0 idlblauthor0gtAuthor 1ltlabelgtltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8gt             ltdiv classinputgroupgtltinput classformcontrol ... keeps going with irrelevant information         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idauthor1 classformgroupgt         ltdiv classcolsm4 controllabelgtltlabel class forauthor1 idlblauthor1gtAuthor 2ltlabelgtltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8gt             ltdiv classinputgroupgtltinput classformcontrol ... keeps going with irrelevant information         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idauthor2 classformgroupgt         ltdiv classcolsm4 controllabelgtltlabel class forauthor2 idlblauthor2gtAuthor 3ltlabelgtltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8gt             ltdiv classinputgroupgtltinput classformcontrol ... keeps going with irrelevant information         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idauthor3 classformgroupgt         ltdiv classcolsm4 controllabelgtltlabel class forauthor3 idlblauthor3gtAuthor 4ltlabelgtltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8gt             ltdiv classinputgroupgtltinput classformcontrol ... keeps going with irrelevant information         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idauthor4 classformgroupgt         ltdiv classcolsm4 controllabelgtltlabel class forauthor4 idlblauthor4gtAuthor 5ltlabelgtltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8gt             ltdiv classinputgroupgtltinput classformcontrol ... keeps going with irrelevant information         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 25430 pI have a really frustrating problem with eclipse PDT. When I am debugging I am getting exceptions all the timewhich should not be there I suspect the eclipse cached some of the files and this is the reason why I am getting those exceptions. I am sure that the code is correct at least where eclipse is throwing the exceptions since when I look at the code in NetBeans I can step over it without getting any exceptions whatsoever. Theres a checkbox for symfony in NetBeans which can ignore the symfony cache and I guess thats why I am able to debug in there. However I very much like eclipse and Id like to use it as a debuging and coding tool. p  pP.S.

Negative 25430 pYesterday I began a small private blog using WordPress 4.1 Windows 7, Apache 2.4, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.6.1, UTF8, generally common settings. I started to transfer my articles into it several of them was fine, but I found two articles which cannot be saved correctly.p  pWhen trying to save these articles as posts WordPress refreshes and shows corrupted version of text. Exact corruption is middle of the article is removed while several garbage characters D for example inserted instead of it.p  pI tried to update WP to the current 4.2.2 version  error is the same upd. 4.2.3  error is the same. I tried to save article as the page instead of post  error is the same. I tried the standard theme instead of custom  error is the same. p  pIt looks like issued articles are longer than others  5.2Kb and 7.5Kb. I tried to see what happens if I would save lesser pieces. While saving a very short piece it works fine. If make a longer piece, WP losts tail of this text. If make a more longer piece, WP starts to lose the middle as described above.p  pCurrently I have no idea how to repair or debug this case.

Negative 25430 pI have an api call that returns a DataSet object in C.

Negative 25430 pI have a record array called election of index number size 4 that contains about 6 different field names, two of which Ill be focusing this question on. Say, that one field name is called totvot total votes, declared as integer and the other called nameC  candidate name,declared as string  and I want to use an codeifcode then loop to sayp  precodeFor count  1 to 4 do      begin        if election[count].totvotgtwcthen          wcelection[count].nameC        end  codepre  pWhat Im doing above is, assuming all four locations in array codeelection[count].totvotcode is populated, I want to then sort all four to find the highest number. For example, if the four locations are populated as such 2, 3, 5, and 6 then 6 would be the highest number. And six would also be in location four because it is the fourth number. After, now that Ive found the highest number, I want to relate the name also found in  location four to that number, hence the line codeWCelection[count].nameCcode. Problem is, I declared codeWCcode standing for winning candidate as an integer and codeelection[count].nameCcode as a string type variable. And I dont know what code to use to get the two to relate not convert integer to string, but relate. Below is the code that I used to declare and initialize the variables I mentioned.  p  precodeVar  wc,rate,total,choice,count,totgen,totspe,totspo,y,r integer  Electionarray[1..4]of Elect Begin  clrscr  textcolor10  wc0   for count1 to 4 do    begin      Election[count].totvot0      Election[count].nameC codepre  pSo essentially, I just wanna relate the highest value in the array election[count].totvot to the name of the candidate that has the highest votes.p

But pay attention to the   parameter profilep      pint posixmemalign void memptr, sizet align, sizet sizep      pThe Intel Compiler also provides another set of memory allocation   APIs.

For example, the following   statement requests a 64byte aligned memory block for 8 floating point   elements.p      pfarray  float mmmalloc8sizeoffloat, 64p      pMemory that is allocated using mmmalloc must be freed using   mmfree. Calling free on memory allocated with mmmalloc or calling mmfree on memory allocated with malloc will result in unpredictable behavior.p blockquote  pThe clear differences from a user perspective is that codemmmalloccode requires direct CPU and compiler support and memory allocated with codemmmalloccode must be freed with codemmfreecode.

Negative 25430 pThis is something ive struggled with all week. Im working on a 2D project, and what I want is for my enemies to move from the right to the left hand side of the screen landscape. Im moving them like this p  precodetransform.Translate new Vector31,0,0  speed  Time.deltaTime codepre  pAt the same time, I want them to constantly rotate on a pivot in the middle of the sprite. As an example, imagine they are in space and are sort of floating uncontrollably, they would spin. Ive asked this question a couple of times with no response so I guess my explanation isnt really very good. This is what Ive triedp  ul lipAnimating the objects. This didnt work because changing the Z rotation caused the sprites to spin in a tornado but not from one side of the screen to the otherpli lipThis  codetransform.Rotate 0,0,50Time.deltaTimecode I messed around with the X,Y and Z properties but they pretty much all made a tornado type effect or rotated in 3d so disappeared when at 180 degrees. pli ul  pI also imported a spritesheet where they are at different points in the spin so say at 10,20,30...360 degrees etc. but this wanst smooth at allp  pI hope this makes sense. Ive spend quite a few hours on it now I cant get my head around it as Ive moved from Xcode where this sort of stuff is 1 line of code.

Negative 25430 pdoes anyone know how to replace variable value after a program that changes it I tried static variable before, but it doesnt save after you close the program.p  pFor examplep  precodeimport java.lang.Math  public class Main     static int A1    public static void main String [] args       A1int 1Math.random10            codepre  pLets say the first time the program is run, A1 holds a value of 5. Is it possible that next time the program is run, A1 still holds a value of 5 instead of zero before reaching the main methodp  pThanksp
Negative 25430 pI am trying to hack up a multi tenancy multi database application using laravel. After going through a lot of articles on the web, I now understand that there are different approaches to the database architecture.p  ol liTo have a single database and have codetenantidcode foreign key to separate the tenant recordsli liTo have multiple databases to separate each tenants datali ol  pThe project I am working on requires that every tenant has his own database for security purposes. Now I am trying to manually hack up a Laravel 5 installation to achieve this but I am not a pro and I am seeing some setbacks.p  pSo I started with creating the migration for the main DB which will store all the tenants. I created this migration in a folder called codemaincode under the migrations folder. The schema looks like sop  precodeSchemacreatetenants, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegtstringname     tablegttextdescription     tablegtstringlogo     tablegtstringusername     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pThen I went ahead and created the migrations files for the tenant databases and I placed them in the codetenantscode folder inside the migrations folder. The schema looks like sop  pUsers Tablep  precodeSchemacreateusers, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pRoles Tablep  precodeSchemacreateroles, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegtstingname     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pAnd a pivot between the twop  precodeSchemacreateroleuser, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegtintegerroleidgtunsigned     tablegtforeignroleidgtreferncesidgtonroles     tablegtintegeruseridgtunsigned     tablegtforeignuseridgtreferncesidgtonusers     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pAt this point I started with a seed files which would create multiple fake tenants and then for each tenant run the migration to create the tenants database. The seed file looks like sop  precodepublic function run      faker  Fakercreate       Fetching all tenants     tenants  AppTenantall       Deleting their databases     tenantsgteachfunctiontenant         DBstatementDROP DATABASE IF EXISTS  . tenantgtusername         DBstatementDROP USER IF EXISTS  . tenantgtusername            Truncating the tenants table itself     DBtabletenantsgttruncate      fori  0 i lt 3 i         company  fakergtcompany         description  fakergttext         logo  fakergtimageUrl50, 50         username  strrandom20          Tenantcreate[             name          gt company,             description   gt description,             logo          gt logo,             username      gt username,         ]           Creating a new user by the username of the tenant          Also giving him privileges on the database by the same name         DBstatementCREATE USER  . username . localhost IDENTIFIED BY admin12345         DBstatementGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON .

So is storing the password in the main database a good idea I mean I can encrypt and store it and then when I need to connect to the DB, I can take the username of the tenant and the decrypted password to connect to the DB. Is this a good approachp  pOther than this I am also confused on how to connect to a DB dynamically and run the migrations for the tenant tables. I know I can call artisan commands to run migrations but how to connect to the DB firstp  pI am also confused as how to go about checking which user is logged in. I mean every tenant has its own users. So when a user is logging in, I am also asking then their tenant username so that I know which database to connect to and then authenticate them to the users table in it.p  pBut again I am confused that if I am even on the right track with this approachp  pSo my main problem right now is to connect to a different database dynamically. How do I go about doing thatp

Negative 25430 pBit of a weird one i cant seem to understand so i have a tableview control in a viewcontroller and within the tableviewcell i have a button which is using a delegate.p  pSo when the button is clicked it will change the tag number of the cell and also change the image of the button based on the tag of the cell in the tableview. p  pBut the problem im having is that when you select a button in a row i.e. the first one it seems to be running the function to change the image for each item in a section almost. I.e choosing the 5th item will update every 5th button in a cell to the selected image which is weird. Since its almost like the tableview is being split up to sections of 5.p  pCan anyone help prevent this behaviour so it only changes the icon for the button in the cell which has been pressed.p  pBelow are the functions that ive used and a link to a video on dropbox showing the behaviour a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsa4aasti78872w6jHelp.movdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comsa4aasti78872w6jHelp.movdl0ap  pstrongDelegatestrongp  precodeprotocol StoryTableViewCellDelegate class       func didBookmarkItemcell StoryTableViewCell, sender AnyObject   codepre  pstrongFunction for Delegatestrongp  precodeIBAction func bookmarkButtonDidTouchsender AnyObject       bookmarkButton.animation  pop     bookmarkButton.curve  easeOut     bookmarkButton.duration  0.5     bookmarkButton.damping  0.4     bookmarkButton.velocity  0.4     bookmarkButton.animate       The delegate which will handle bookmarking items     delegate.didBookmarkItemself, sender sender   codepre  pstrongFunction being used in tableview classstrongp  precode MARK StoryTableViewDelegate func didBookmarkItemcell StoryTableViewCell, sender AnyObject        TODO Implement bookmark functionality     switch cell.bookmarkButton.tag       case 0         cell.bookmarkButton.setImageUIImagenamed BookmarkSelected, forState UIControlState.Normal         cell.bookmarkButton.tag  1       case 1         cell.bookmarkButton.setImageUIImagenamed BookmarkNotSelected, forState UIControlState.Normal         cell.bookmarkButton.tag  0     default       break       codepre
