Positive 65778 pI have a fair bit of experience with Postgres and PostGIS running queries and scripts, but no experience creating functions. I feel like what I want to achieve is rather more complex than the examples Ive seen so Im hoping someone can help me out.p  pIm creating a web application that allows users to update lot boundary records stored in a spatial table based on the intersection with a polygon drawn on a map and some values entered into a form. I dont know if there is a way of storing a subset of database records in an array and iterating over it, updating each record in turn, or if I have to run separate update scripts within the function. Im also not sure if its possible to pass in a table name as an argument to a function, as Id like to just run the function and have it work on different tables.p  pIf I would create a function that would do all the things I wanted it to do by simply running a bunch of separate UPDATE scripts, it might look like the following function not actually testedp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION updateLotswktgeom text, tablename varchar25, landuse varchar25, density NUMERIC4,1   RETURNs VOID AS    BEGIN     UPDATE [tablename] SET landuse  [landuse] WHERE STIntersectiongeom, GeomFromWKT[wktgeom], 3857     UPDATE [tablename] SET density  [density] WHERE STIntersectiongeom, GeomFromWKT[wktgeom], 3857 WHERE landuse  Residential     UPDATE [tablename] SET density  NULL WHERE STIntersectiongeom, GeomFromWKT[wktgeom], 3857 WHERE landuse  Residential     UPDATE [tablename] SET yield  area  10000  [density] WHERE STIntersectiongeom, GeomFromWKT[wktgeom], 3857 END  LANGUAGE plpgsql codepre  pWhile this approach would save me from running several nested database scripts from the server, it seems inefficient and Postgres will not accept strongtablenamestrong as an argument as is. Hence Im wondering the following 2 thingsp  ol liIs there a way to create a subset of a table based on the spatial intersection with a provided geometry and iterate over each record, performing the necessary updates If yes, how might this function be specifiedli liCan I provide a table name as an argument to a functionli ol  pIm not sure of the best way to proceed, so if someone can tell me if what I want to do is possible and if so get me started with specifying a function Id be very appreciative.p  pCheers. p

Negative 65778 pI have an XSD  it is designed to allow clients to my webservice to send XML data in a structured and robust way thats the whole point of XSDs right.p  pHowever I am designing some other part of the system and was going to use this XSD because it does 99.999999 of what I need it to do  it has all the data I could ever want  except it is missing an element that I need it to hold  a database primary key value.  p  pSo you may be thinking  whats your problem, just add the element to the XSD and get on with it  Well yes I could, but the problem is  the client side of the system would not know what to do with this element leave it blank,   they dont have to put in a primary key value in, actually impossible for them to do so  makes sense really, if you are sending data to the database, its the database that makes the primary key value, not the person sending it.p  pSo what do I do  Do I make 2 almost identical XSDs one with a primary key value element, and one without or just try and shoehorn everything into one XSD, but as a side effect cause possible confusionp

Negative 65778 pI have an API which internally has some exceptions for error reporting. The basic structure is that it has a root exception object which inherits from codestdexceptioncode, then it will throw some subclass of that.p  pSince catching an exception thrown in one library or thread and catching it in another can lead to undefined behavior at least Qt complains about it and disallows it in many contexts. I would like to wrap the library calls in functions which will return a status code, and if an exception occurred, a copy of the exception object.p  pWhat is the best way to strongstorestrong an exception with its polymorphic behavior for later use I believe that the c0x future API makes use of something like this. So what is the best approachp  pThe best I can think of is to have a codeclonecode method in each exception class which will return a pointer to an exception of the same type. But thats not very generic and doesnt deal with standard exceptions at all.p  pAny thoughtsp  pstrongEDITstrong It seems that c0x will have a hrefhttpwww2.research.att.combsC0xFAQ.htmlrethrow relnofollowa mechanism for thisa. It is described as library magic. Does that mean that is doesnt require any of the language features of c0x if not, are there any implementations which are compatible with c03p  pstrongEDITstrong Looks like boost has an a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1430libsexceptiondoccurrentexception.html relnofollowimplementation of exception copyinga. Ill keep the question open for any non codeboostcopyexceptioncode answers.p  pstrongEDITstrong To address jrandomhackers concerns about the root cause of the exception being an out of memory error. For this particular library and set of exceptions, this is not the case. All exceptions derived from the root exception object represent different types of parsing errors caused by invalid user input. Memory related exceptions will simply cause a codestdbadalloccode to be thrown which is addressed separately.p
Negative 65778 pAre there any services available that allow me to manipulate maps in an offline setting I am working on a project that requires me to take a map and based on features on the map, generate a game world. I have looked at a few of the APIs for different providers Google, ms, etc. The APIs I looked seem to be strictly showing a user a map. I am looking for something that allows me to create a derivative of a map the Gameworld, that will never be seen by the public, and is only used by the game engine. However one caveat is that I would like to be able to link the derivative created for use by the game engine, with something I can show the user. p  pAs an example. Think of a cross country racing sim. Users cannot control the vehicles directly in this game, they can only control the cars setup, driver, etc. I create a gameworld from a map. The gameworld data driver position, etc is overlayed onto a real map. A race might last several days. The only interaction users have with the real map is viewing their position on the map, and where they are in relation to the others.p  pI dont want to violate the terms of the API here. I read Googles API TOS, and it seems to me that creating the gameworld would violdate their TOS.p  pThe features I really need are the followingp  ul liThe ability to locate a specific place on the map by latlongli liThe abilityrights to grab those maps and save them as an image file temporarily for processingli liThe abilityrights to store a gameworld that is based on the real mapli liThe ability to show a user a map with an overlay this is optional. I can use googles API, or any other one that supports latlong.li ul  pEdit The gameworld creation will only happen once intially, and partial updates may occur very infrequently. I will only need to generate the world in the beginning. This is also for a free game, so I am looking for something opensourcep  pEdit I only need maps of the US. I need maps that contain rivers and lakes.p
Negative 65778 pI have some websites that use ImageMagick to convert images and place them in a created folder. Locally it all worked fine, but once I deployed it to my networks webserver it would not convert the images nor create the folders. My asp.net pages that read data from a database work.

Negative 65778 pI have a custom control based on the label control. My question is how I disable the selection box around this custom control when a user selects it while in design mode.  I would like to just change the font color when selected, and then change it back when unselected.p  pThe reason for this is because when you have many labels with small font very close together it makes it hard to see the other labels when you select one of them and the selection box from the one selected obscures the user from seen the other labels that are very close to the one selected.p
Negative 65778 pIm building a management application to help manage my mobile auto detailing company and hopefully others.  Im struggling to figure out how to model some of the data.p  pThis question is related to a previous question that Ive posted, but Ive reproduced the relevant information below  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3120192databasedesigngoogleappenginehttpstackoverflow.comquestions3120192databasedesigngoogleappengineap  pIn this application, there are concepts of Appointments and Line Items.p  pstrongAppointmentsstrong are a place and time where employees are expected to be in order to deliver a service.p  pstrongLine Itemsstrong are a service, fee or discount and its associated information.  An example of line items that might go into an appointmentp  pre Name                          Price Commission Time estimate    Full Detail, Regular Size        160       75       3.5 hours  10 Off Full Detail Coupon       10        0         0 hours  Premium Detail                   220      110       4.5 hours  Derived totalsnot a line item 370     185       8.0 hours pre  pIn my previous implementation of this application, Line Items were contained by a single appointment.  This worked fine most of the time, but caused problems sometimes.  An example would be if an appointment got interrupted halfway through because of rain and the technician had to come back out the next day and finish up.  This situation required two appointments for the same line item.  In cases like this, I would just fudge the data a little by setting the line item on the second appointment to read something like Finish Up and then the cost would be 0.p  pIn this next version, I am considering enabling Line Items to be matched with more than one appointment with a table structure that looks like thisp  precodeAppointment  starttime  etc...  LineItem  appointmentKeyList  name  price  etc... codepre  pA general problem with this structure is that it is complicated and Im not even sure if its appropriate to match one line item with multiple appointments.  If Line Items can only be part of one Appointment, then I can actually just put a list of line items IN each Appointment, when I get Appointments, Id already be getting Line Items.p  pA more specific problem is that I am using google app engine and if I want to query for a set of appointments and their associated line items, Id have to first query for the set of appointments and then do a second query for the line items using the IN operator to test if any of the LineItems appointment keys fall into the set of appointment keys the were returned from the previous query.  The second query will fail if I have more than 30 keys requiring me to shard the query.  I could denormalize the data to avoid this complicated and extensive read query, and I will probably have to denormalize to some degree anyway, but Id rather avoid complexity where appropriate.p  pMy question is how is this type of situation usually modeled  Is it even appropriate for a Line Item to be paired with more than one appointment, or is it normal to simply split line items into separate ones for each appointment such as 1st half of 2 day job and 2nd half of two day job.  How do similar successful applications do this  What are the rules of thumb in this type of situation  What implementations have turned out to be less problematicp  pThanksp

Negative 65778 pIve been tasked to maintain a PHP website with a function which automatically generates RTF files and provides a link to download. Each time the previously generated file is overwritten by the new one.p  pHowever, it seems that upon attempting to download the generated file, the browser will sometimes retrieve a cached version which is normally different from the latest version so you get the same document as last time rather than the one you requested.p  pI managed to work around this by giving each generated file a unique name based on the current timestamp but this generates lots of clutter in the directory which will need to be cleaned out periodically. Ideally I would like to tag this file such that the browser wont cache it and will get the latest version every time. How might I achieve thisp

Negative 65778 pAll thread create methods like pthreadcreate or CreateThread in Windows expect the caller to provide a pointer to the arg for the thread.  Isnt this inherently unsafe p  pThis can work safely only if the arg is in the heap, and then again creating a heap variable adds to the overhead of cleaning the allocated memory up. If a stack variable is provided as the arg then the result is at best unpredictable.p  pThis looks like a halfcooked solution to me, or am I missing some subtle aspect of the APIsp

Negative 65778 pIm helping out a colleague on this one so if Im missing some details thats why.p  pWe have an asp.net 3.5 web application calling a WCF service.  Originally the app used a Web Reference to register the service however after having some trouble and burning an incident with Microsoft their solution was to replace the Web Reference with a Service Reference to the WCF service.p  pThis is great except the problem is that when we create a Service Reference, the method signatures are different than they were when a Web Reference was used.p  pFrom what Ive read this may be expected, however in our case this would mean some significant changes to the application and of course it was due yesterday...so...p  p...Im wondering two thingsp  ol liIs it normalexpected that method signatures will change based on the reference typeli liIs there a way to create the Service Reference that will generate method signatures identical to the original Web Referenceli ol

Negative 65778 pHey folks, I have to apologize for my inexperience here, Ive been working on this for about an hour but Im so new to jQuery that I dont even know emwhatem to search for...p  pIve got a page a hrefhttpmilliondollarextreme.tv relnofollowhttpmilliondollarextreme.tva that has multiple YouTube video embeds on it.  I am trying to make the videos resize to fill the divisions that they are placed in, dynamically, according to that divisions width so that I have the option to change it later.  Simply putting in  width 100  will work for the width, but the videos dont maintain their aspect ratio.  So I used the following scriptp  precodecontainer width30  ltscriptgt var vidPlayer  embed var aspect  vidPlayer.attrheight  vidPlayer.attrwidth     window.resizefunction            var playerWidth  container.width           vidPlayer             .widthplayerWidth             .heightplayerWidth  aspect     .triggerresize ltscriptgt codepre  pThis is currently not implemented on my page, but it emdoesem work for single postings.  For the permalink, single entry postings, it works perfectly.  However, on the index of videos, where 510 videos are going to be posted at a time, it will only work if all the videos are the same aspect ratio.  If the first video is 43 widthheight, then all subsequent video players get resized 43, even if the video is supposed to be 169, or something else.p  pIm assuming that the reason for this, is that the script searches for embed, and once it finds one, it stops searching.  It has the variables, and it applies them to all subsequent video players regardless of the dimensions.p  pLets say Ive got ten videos on a page.  Five of them are your standard 43 aspect pictures, with dimensions like 640x480px.  The other five are 169 aspect ratio 1280x720px.  I need to make this script check each one then resize on an individual basis, rightp  pIve got to use a script because I might change the design layout division width in the future, and I have about forty or so more videos to post.p  pI dont even know emhowem or emwhatem functions to use here.  It looks like .each or .live might be good bets, and I tried tossing them in there to no avail.  Any help would be hugely appreciated.p

Ive followed the directions at a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb816169httpsupport.microsoft.comkb816169a to create the setup project with no trouble. p  pI want to be able to get a value during the installation in order to update the app.config with the users desired settings. I added a emTextboxes Aem dialog to retrieve the values. I set the emEdit1Propertyem property to TIMETORUN, and in my Primary Output actions emCustomActionDataem property I put in the following emTimeToRun[TIMETORUN]em. So far so good. Running the setup I can retrieve the emTimeToRunem value from the emContext.Parametersem collection without issue.p  pIn order to locate the app.config I need to also pass in the value of the emTARGETDIRem Windows Installer Property to my custom action. This is where things begin to fall apart. In order to achieve this, the above emCustomActionDataem must be altered like so emTimeToRun[TIMETORUN] TargetDir[TARGETDIR]em. Now when I run the setup I get the following error messagep  pstrongError 1001. Exception occurred while initializing the installation. System.IO.FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly fileCWindowsSysWOW64Files or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.strongp  pIf you google this problem you will inevitably find people having tremendous success by simply adding the trailing slash to the emTargetDir[TARGETDIR]em portion of the emCustomActionDataem. This unfortunately does not solve my issue.p  pI tried so many different variations of the emCustomActionDataem string and none of them worked. I tried logging to a file from my overridden emInstallem method to determine where the breakage was, but no log file is created because its not even getting that far. As the error indicates, the failure is during the Initialization step.p  pI have a hunch that it could be one of the dependencies that the setup project is trying to load. Perhaps somehow something is being appended to the emCustomActionDataem string and isnt playing well with the emTARGETDIRem value which contains spaces, i.e. CProgram FilesMy CompanyProject Name. Again, this is another hunch that I cannot seem to confirm due to my inability to debug the setup process.p  pOne further thing to mention, and yes its another hunch, could this be an issue with Setup Projects on 64bit version of Windows Im running Windows 7 Professional.p  pIll provide names of the dependencies in case it helpsp  ul liMicrosoft .NET Frameworkli liMicrosoft.SqlServer.DtsMsg.dllli liMicrosoft.SqlServer.DTSPipelineWrap.dllli liMicrosoft.SqlServer.DTSRuntimeWrap.dllli liMicrosoft.SQLServer.ManagedDTS.dllli liMicrosoft.SqlServer.msxml6interop.dllli liMicrosoft.SqlServer.PipelineHost.dllli liMicrosoft.SqlServer.SqlTDiagM.dllli ul  pAs you may glean from the dependencies, the Windows Service is scheduling a call to a DTSX package.p  pSorry for the long rant. Thanks for any help you can provide.p

Negative 65778 pIm well aware that the general rule of thumb is you should only import what is necessarybase class interfaces, protocol interfaces, etc.for a class to compile and use codeclasscode for everything that can be forwarddeclared. However, I ran into the following scenario in which I felt like codeimportcode was a more appropriate solutionp  precodeimport ClassA.h       Previously, class ClassA import ClassB.h       Previously, class ClassB import ClassC.h       Unnecessary to forwarddeclare  interface ClassD  NSObject  property nonatomic, retain ClassA   classAObject property nonatomic, retain ClassB   classBObject property nonatomic, copy   NSArray  classCObjects  end codepre  pAt first, I simply forwarddeclared codeClassAcode and codeClassBcode as the components of codeclassCObjectscode are of codeClassCcode only by contract. This was my initial instinct.p  pBut after trying to use codeClassDcode elsewhere, I quickly realized that I had to also import codeClassAcode, codeClassBcode, and codeClassCcode along with codeClassDcode everywhere I used it. This seems like something another class shouldnt have to care about when using codeClassDcode. My thinking was that, basically, a user of codeClassDcode should really only care about importing codeClassD.hcode and assume it can work with the entire class without a bunch of other codeimportcode statements. Given the above approach, Ive basically included everything necessary to work within the domain of codeClassDcode right in its interface.p  pIs there a strong reason why this approach is not ideal, except for youve included more than is absolutely necessary for compilationp

Negative 65778 pI have developed a tiny application with .NET 3.5 with couple of forms and one rdlc report. after then I upgraded it to .NET 4.0 and distributed to the client with .NET client profile and windows installer 3.1 added in prerequisite.

So while reading the xmlrpc faq I came acrossp  blockquote   p2.20 How do I call an XMLRPC method   with a variable number of parameters   The params keyword can be used to call   an XMLRPC method which take a   variable number of parameters. For   example, if an XMLRPC method takes a   variable number number of integer   parameters it could be defined like   this    [XmlRpcUrlhttpwww.cookcomputing.comnotimpl.rem]   public interface IParams    IXmlRpcProxy     [XmlRpcMethod]br   int UseNumbersparams int[] numbers     And called like this  IFoo proxy    IFooXmlRpcProxyGen.CreatetypeofIFoo   proxy.SendMultipleParameters1   proxy.SendMultipleParameters1, 2,   3p      pAlternatively the parameters in this   example can be supplied as an array of   type int[]  int[] parameters  new   int[]  1, 2, 3    proxy.SendMultipleParametersparametersp blockquote  pMy problem is I dont understand how to apply this concept to my project, I am a newbie, I tried upcLookupValues[]  parameters  new string[]  rpckey, upc  But I get a cant implicitly convert string[] to readUPC.upcLookupvalues[].  I also dont understand how to define the new proxy for submission.  My fingers are crossed this post makes sense. I am sure you C xmlrpc folks are laughing right now.p

Negative 65778 pI am new to CQRS and I am tying to make sense of business rule validation within the write side domain. I know that client side validation should be done in terms of valid date required field, string length, valid email, etc and business rulebusiness domain related validation should be done in domain side. Actually, same client side validation rules should also be applied to command in the domain since we dont trust the users.p  pSo, we have a valid command AddEmailToCustomer and the command handler is invoked on the command. Here is my approach to validation.p  ol liCreate instances of two command validators in the command handler.li liFirst one validates the command data same as client side validation required field, valid email, etc.li liSecond validator validates the data based on logic within the second validator. Something like is this customer active, or what ever. I know the changing email doesnt fit here but it is not important. Important thing is there is a business validation here.li liWe look at the ValidationResult returned by the Validator.ValidateICommand cmd and we find out there are errorsli liWe will not get a customer from repository to call on the UpdateEmail method on the AR. So what do we do at this pointli ol  pDo I throw and exception in the command handler and add these errors there Do I send the command to error queue or somewhere else Do I respond with something like Bus.Reply and return error code If so, what do I do with the error messages How do I communicate these errors to the user I know I can email them later but in a web scenario I can send a request id in the command or use the message id, and poll for response with the request id and display the error messages to user.p  pYour guidance is appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 65778 pI know that serializing an object is to my knowledge the only way to effectively deepcopy an object as long as it isnt stateful like codeIOcode and whatnot, but is one way particularly more efficient than anotherp  pFor example, since Im using Rails, I could always use codeActiveSupportJSONcode, codetoxmlcode  and from what I can tell marshalling the object is one of the most accepted ways to do this.

The simplest idea I could think of was a CSS table in which all cells have a black background and a CSS attribute codevisibility hiddencode then changing each cell one at a time to codevisibility visiblecode with a setTimeOutp  pThe other approach I could think of is nesting a black background CSS div, my black unit, within another div set to the final area size and cloning the nested div with setTimeOut until the parent div is completely full. Im not sure which solution is lighter if either.p  pWhere Im particularly stuck is how to reference each cell or div one at a time, and whether I have to give each black table cell or div unit a manual id reference, which is less flexible, or whether it can be done dynamically.p

Negative 65778 pIve been reading other questions on how to implement ifexistsinsertelseupdate semantics in EF, but either Im not understanding how the answers work, or they are in fact not addressing the issue.

Using a transaction will emnotem cause this however, and well get an UpdateException thrown due to the key violation that occurs when the second thread attempts to create the same user for a second time.p  pInstead of catching the exception caused by the race condition, it would be better to prevent the race condition from happening in the first place.  One way to do this would be for the starred line to take out an exclusive lock on the database row that matches its condition, meaning that in the context of this block, only one thread at a time could work with a user.p  pIt seems that this must be a common problem for users of the EF, so Im looking for a clean, generic solution that I can use everywhere.p  pId really like to avoid using a stored procedure to create my user if possible.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongEDITstrong I tried executing the above code concurrently on two different threads using the same user ID, and despite taking out serializable transactions, they were both able to enter the critical section  concurrently. This lead to an UpdateException being thrown when the second thread attempted to insert the same user ID that the first had just inserted. This is because, as pointed out by Ladislav below, a serializable transaction takes exclusive locks only after it has begun modifying data, not reading.p

Negative 65778 pRecently, while taking an introductory unit focused on Object Oriented programming, I was introduced to the Garbage Collector in C, and that its role is to clean up objects that are no longer being referenced.

Negative 65778 pI know there are a slew of questions about this alreadybut Id like to add linebreaks to Facebook wall posts that are being posted via the Graph API. Ive seen a variety of answers suggesting using codeltcentergtltcentergtcode, but that doesnt work for meit just prints codeltcentergtltcentergtcode in the post.p  pTo be specific, Im using Ruby and the Koala gem. I am attempting to post to a users empageem. If I post as a link and try the center hack in the description of the post, it works as expectedbut not in the message, where I actually need it.p  pUPDATE Ive submitted a patch to the Koala gem that allows a noencoding option to be set. Ifwhen this patch is accepted, it will allow for linebreaks if that options is set to true. For now, folks with this issue can grab my fork of the gem a hrefhttpsgithub.comideaoforderkoala relnofollowhttpsgithub.comideaoforderkoalaap  pFor those who are curious, the issue was with Faraday. The request method was set to urlencode which sends the params as urlencoded form data. The params have to be sent as regular data, not form data like using the d flag instead of the f flag in cURL. We accomplish this by sending data as part of the query string instead of encoded params.p

Negative 65778 pIm using the slidedeck jquery plugin which basically puts slides on my page. Everything works fine, but the problem is with the css loading part. Below these slides i have an import statement for another page. This page which im importing fetches quite a bit of data from the database before being completely displayed. So whenever i open my page for a second or two the display for my page goes hay wire. The probable cause of this may be that im putting most of my jquery including the one for these slides in the document.onready function. So since the document is not loaded completely for that period of time slides are also not displayed. as in they are displayed but in a weird manner......they are all over the page Is there some way i can make sure that my css and jquery get loaded first and then a call is made to this page which im importing or something like that. i just want that my display comes fine right in the beginning.p  pthis is the slidedeck jquery plugin im using slidedeck  a hrefhttpwww.slidedeck.com relnofollowhttpwww.slidedeck.comap

So if anyone can enlighten me..p  pIm working on an ASP.Net MVC 3 application my first one using codefirst Entity Framework as my data model. Its going to be an online shop and I am working on the Admin controller where, as an admin, you will be able to edit products etc. When it comes to adding a new product, you must specify a category, which means a dropdown list of categories.p  pI started off by just returning an IEnumerable collection of categories in the ViewBag, based on the information I found a hrefhttpwww.mikesdotnetting.comArticle128GetTheDropOnASP.NETMVCDropDownLists relnofollowherea. This seemed like a really nice way to approach things.p  pBut I got the same error youll see below.

Negative 65778 pemI have searched and found other people having problems with getting rid of toolbox items, mainly in VS 2008, but have found no answer applicable to my question.emp  pAll datasets we create and use are shown in the toolbox, and we have no use for them being shown there. Similar questions have been answered with suggestions like using Choose Items, Delete the dlls, but those answers either dont fit our problem situation or dont work for us.p  pThe toolbox gets really cluttered when each project in the solution gets a tab in the toolbox. And each tab gets one item for every dataset we create and use. As already stated, we have no use for the datasets being shown there and have tried to remove them. The obvious is using Choose Items and unselect the datasets, leaving us with empty tabs  which is slightly better but by no means good. But after restarting VS2010, all datasets are back again...p  pHow to be able hide these datasets, andor whole project tabs, in the toolboxp

Negative 65778 pI am having some trouble trying to rework a function that checks a users input log in info against info stored in a mysql table.p  pIt basically works like this, when the user submits the log in form, their input user and pass are matched against a table in mysql.p  pThe table would contain info such as a user id, username and password. If there is a match, the first function, UserIsLoggedIn returns true.p  pCertain pages require certain roles, or user categories, so the user is then checked for the correct role. This is a linking table that would link the user id to the role id. If the user does have the required role, the next function, UserHasRole returns true.p  pThis works perfectly fine currently. But I have added a new seperate section to this site that would require certain users to be able to log in to the site. The problem is, that this set of users, must be kept seperate from the original group of users which gets truncated each time there is an update from the legacy point of sale software controlling that set of user accounts A simple idea...p  pBut given my limited knowledge when it comes to mysql, i was hoping that some people with a bit more wisdom than me on the matter... Might like to provide some suggestions, or input in ways to go about this task.p  pMy current query, relating to the first check, or function, looks like thisp  precodeSELECT COUNT FROM users WHERE idaccNum AND passwordpassword codepre  pThe variables would relate the the input information.p  pThe query relating to the second check, looks like thisp  precodeSELECT COUNT FROM users INNER JOIN userroles ON users.id  userId INNER JOIN roles ON roleId  roles.id WHERE users.id  accNum AND roles.idrole codepre  pThe additional variable here, relates to the required user role, this is coded into any specific page.p  pNow what I want to do, is have a new table, lets call it otherUsers. Then have the function check the provided user information against the users table, and if no match is found, then check the info against the otherUsers table. Then essentially, either set of users may log in to the site.p  pThats is how i imagine it should happen anyway, which is why I am here looking for any input or suggestions relating to this matter.p  pAs a note though, the first group of users had an id range of 19999, I am assuming the second group should have a range of 10000END, that way the linking table usertypes can be used to link the second group of users to the different roles too.p  pAnyone taking to read through this should know that it has been effort appreciated, thank youp

Negative 65778 pIm having an issue with UIImageView thats not quite making sense to me.  I want to set the image of the UIImageView and have it appear above the patterned image Ive set to the background.  This occurs correctly if the background color is a standard color [UIColor whiteColor], but as soon as set it to a patternImage the background becomes completely transparent.  This is kind of frustrating.  I can get around it by creating another view, setting the backgroundColor of it to a patternImage, and then adding the UIImageView as a subview, but thats creating an extra view that should be unnecessary, IMO.

Negative 65778 pI have a packageprivate interface called codeAbstractServercode which offers three methods codestartcode, codestopcode and codeinitcode.p  pFor every new server, I implement the interface and override those methods.

This way, to remove a Server from the codeServerManagercode, I would writep  precodeServerManager.INSTANCE.removeServerHttpServer.IDENTIFIER codepre  pThe problem is, that I cant have an abstract attribute in the interface and therefore cant force the implementations to override it.p  pI can also not use a normal method nonstatic because the constructor of the Serverimplementations will be packageprivate.p  pAs an alternative, I thought about using the codeClasscode of the implementations as the keys in the codeHashMapcode so I can write something like thisp  precodeServerManager.INSTANCE.removeServerHttpServer.class codepre  pAny thoughts on thisp

Negative 65778 pI have a report which via a paramter lets the user hide the detail rows, and show only the total rows. They can also group on a number of different fields, or none at all. When I export this report to Excel, and the detail rows are hidden, excel yields VALUE for all of the total rows values. p  pI believe this is because Excel is trying to use aggregate functions on the data contained in the report for calculating these values and seeing as how that data is not present on the report generate by SSRS its breaking, but I have read that Excel exports from SSRS do not create expressions in fields, its just moving the value calculated by SSRS. p  pDoes anyone have any idea if this is happening for the reasons I think it is, or if some other limitation is creating the issue. We currently do not have a work around appart from reexporting the report without the detail rows being hidden, so any advice would be welcome.p

For n3p  precodevar m  [    [functionreturn 1, functionreturn 2, functionreturn 3],    [functionreturn 4, functionreturn 5, functionreturn 6],    [functionreturn 7, functionreturn 8, functionreturn 9] ] codepre  pNow, in the example, each one of those functions would actually contain chunks of code from the code to be obfuscated, and call that in. A typical obfuscated code would look like thisp  pcodefunction m[1][2]m[2][0]m[0][1]m[1][0]m[2][2]m[1][1]m[1][2]m[2][0] codep  pThe above translates into thisp  pcodefunction 6 72  4  9  5 6 7    codep  pOf course, assuming that a typical codem[x][y]code returns functions or whatever as necessary, this would all be very easily decipherable. So after every codem[x][y]code call, codem[x][y]code would switch position with codem[x1][y1]code which would switch at his turn position with codem[0][2]code and basically I want to mixed them up so bad you wouldnt even dare attempt to decipher. Probably using random generated math, and that goes as per function.p  pThe point is that the obfuscator needs to know this formula beforehand, so it knows which codem[x][y]code to call in, and at which point, and decide the order in which to bandwagon the functions. A working implementation might even result inp  pcodefunction m[0][0]m[0][0]m[0][0]m[0][0] codep  pAnd still work. So here are my questionsp  ol lipHow can I split javascript code into smaller functions I know compilers basically do that, but I also seen some online JS beautifiers, and syntax highlighters being able to distinguish code and do their thing properly. I mean can basic regex do the jobpli lipThis doesnt work and it shouldp  precodewindow.a  functionx      var r  x2      window.a alert  redefines itself after first call     return r   a2  2    a2  doesnt work. it shouldve alerted 2  2  4 codepre  pThis on the other hand does workp  precodevar i  0 window.a  functionx      ifi1         i0         return alertx            i1     return x2    a2  2a2 codepre  pWhypli lipAre there any similar ongoing projects Maybe I can get some notes or reference to them.pli ol

Negative 65778 pI have found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3963283canimoveaflashobjectwithinthedomwithoutitreloadingCan I move a Flash object within the DOM without it reloadingap  pI m developing a simple video chat application. Whenever I move a flash object within the dom tree, it resets itself. I know there is no solution for it which is a browser specific behaviour. However, I would like to ask whether there is any workaround to do this. My requirements are simple. I have multiple streams which are aligned horizontally. Every stream is a different flash object. When someone enlarges a single Flash object, I need to move it to the top. Whenever I move it to the top, that particular video resets itself, and you wait for a couple of second to get the stream back. Is there any workaround or any way to avoid this. p  pI am currently simply prepending the same list item to the same parent. This is a very important feature and any kind of solution which doesnt require flash to reset itself is acceptable. Except creating a parent flash container which has all the streams within it.p  pThanks,p

But, they did not solve my issue.  Also, I didnt see an option to reask the question.p  pI have almost the same issue.  I have a class that uses codeRSACryptoServiceProvidercode that runs in two projects on the same machine and under the same account.  Both projects live in the same solution and share the same encryption code.  One project, the server, is a Windows service and the other, the client, is a Windows application.  They use the codeRSACryptoServiceProvidercode to talk to each other over a named pipe using asymmetric encryption. I started out by just having the server run in another Windows form within the same application as the client.  Everything ran fine.  Then, I moved the server to a Windows service.  p  pThe Windows service starts up fine.  It seems to be able to create its instance of the codeRSACryptoServiceProvidercode fine.  But, when the client, which runs in the Windows application, starts up it gets a runtime error when it tries to create it.  Here is the code that runs in both projects.p  precoderule  New CryptoKeyAccessRuleeveryone, CryptoKeyRights.FullControl, AccessControlType.Allow csp  New CspParameters csp.KeyContainerName  KeyContainerName csp.Flags  CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore csp.CryptoKeySecurity  New CryptoKeySecurity csp.CryptoKeySecurity.SetAccessRulerule  Object already exists exception happens here rsa  New RSACryptoServiceProviderKeySize, csp codepre  pAs you can see, I have the code that sets the access rule as mentioned in the other post on this subject.

Ive done a similar thing on the same project with another WCF service and it all worked fine.  But this one gave me this error when I used it.p  precode[System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException]    An error occurred while receiving the HTTP response to httpxxxService.svc. This could be due to the service endpoint binding not using the HTTP protocol. This could also be due to an HTTP request context being aborted by the server possibly due to the service shutting down. See server logs for more details.  System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException codepre  pThe inner exception isp  precode[System.Net.WebException]   The underlying connection was closed An unexpected error occurred on a receive.

System.IO.IOException codepre  pThe inner exception of that saysp  precode[System.Net.Sockets.SocketException]    An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host   System.Net.Sockets.SocketException codepre  pSo, heres what Ive tried.  I thought that maybe there is some error in my .svc file or perhaps there is some error in my configuration of the .config files, but as far as I can see there isnt.  Then, I thought I should try and see if I can send a simple type from the server to the client.  I therefore created a method called GetInt which returns 7.  I called this on the client and it worked fine.  Therefore, I think it is the data that Im sending back from the server that is not supported.

Negative 65778 pIm trying to write something similar to a custom app store, and Im having a very hard time hearing the results of the installation.p  pIve tried a variety of things, and none of them have functioned as it appears they should. p  pIn my main activity class, I have the installation code as followsp  precodeIntent intent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONINSTALLPACKAGE intent.setDataAndTypeUri.fromFileapkFile, applicationvnd.android.packagearchive intent.putExtraIntent.EXTRARETURNRESULT, true intent.putExtraIntent.EXTRANOTUNKNOWNSOURCE, true intent.putExtraIntent.EXTRAINSTALLERPACKAGENAME, getApplicationInfo.packageName startActivityForResultintent, resultIndex codepre  pThats pretty straightforward. The first thing I tried to get the result is to override the onActivityResult function in my main activity. That function never gets called a logger statement on the first line never prints.p  pHence, I tried creating a receiver in the manifest.p  precodeltreceiver androidname.PackageReceivergt     ltintentfiltergt         ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.PACKAGEADDED gt         ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt         ltdata androidschemepackage gt     ltintentfiltergt ltreceivergt codepre  pAnd then in the PackageReceiver class, I overrode the onReceive function. This worked in the sense that the PackageReceivers function did get called, but Im now stuck with the problem of how to notify the main activity that something has happened for the purposes of my project, I need to know. I cant instantiate the PackageReciever Android does that for me because its in the manifest. p  pI tried creating a new broadcast, so my PackageReceivers onReceive function looks like thisp  precodeOverride public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      String action  intent.getAction     if action.equalsIntent.ACTIONINSTALLPACKAGE              action.equalsIntent.ACTIONPACKAGEADDED              action.equalsIntent.ACTIONPACKAGECHANGED          logger.debugCaught action of type   action          Intent i2  new Intent         i2.setActionMY.CUSTOM.ACTION         context.sendBroadcasti2        codepre  pThen, over in my main activity, I created a new BroadcastReceiverp  precodeBroadcastReceiver myReceiver  new BroadcastReceiver      Override     public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent          logger.warnI made it HOORAY       codepre  pAnd registered that receiver in the onResume and unregistered in the onPause function, like thisp  precodeOverride protected void onResume      IntentFilter filter  new IntentFilter     filter.addActionMY.CUSTOM.ACTION     registerReceivermyReceiver, filter     logger.debugRegistering receiver in onResume.     super.onResume  codepre  pIt sounded like a nice solution, but myReceiver never has its onRecieve function called. Ive tried making sure I dont unregister when I dont want to by simply removing the unregistration, moving the registration to the onCreate method of the activity, and none of that works. The net result there is that exceptions get thrown in the logger saying Ive leaked an IntentFilter, Did you forget to unregister No, I very purposefully didnt unregister... but... nevermind.p  pIm running out of ideas as to how to bridge this gap. Also, I cant just poll the installed applications and check version numbers. For reasons I cant get into here, we dont use version numbers. I need to know whether or not the user completed the installation that I kicked off.p  pHow can I send information from the PackageReceiver to the main activity Or, how can I catch the result of the installation in the main activity itselfp  pThanks to all who give it a stab. I checked other stackoverflow questions, but none seem to have the answers Im looking for.p

Negative 65778 pHeres the big picturep  pWithin our new SOA based information system, we need to build several WCF services. Those services main goal will be to handle business transactions.p  pLets have an example A user place an order on the site or mobile app, the client application will call a WCF service lets call it Order Process Manager that will orchestrate all the business transaction. The OPM will somehow begin a transaction in order to ensure that if a sub process fails, the all transaction is rollbacked.p  pThe point is that the OPM might have to call other services like User Account Service, Stock Manager Service, whatever... Those services might be existing services that we cannot modify that call stored procedures that commit and rollback their own transactions. Another possibility is that those other services might be built on top of Entity Framework, having their own way to deal with transaction using Unit of Work, transaction scope, repositories and stuff...p  pMy thought is that it wont be as simple as using a transaction scope within the OPM and that it will do all the magic whenever it decides to rollback the all thing.p  pIf anyone has already faced those kinds of issues, Im all earsp  pEnvironment specifications arep  ul li.Net 4.0  Cli liWCFli liSQL Server 2008R2li ul  pMany thanks to everyone.p  pFreddy.p

Negative 65778 pIm converting a legacy workflow system to WF4 so I have to jump through a couple hoops to make it match up with the api of our application.  So Ill try to keep the problem explination as simple as possible. p  pI have a custom activity that takes a sequence as an argument and then executes it.  Prior to executing it, the custom activity needs to traverse the sequence and its branches etc looking for specific types of child activities  then it does some reporting on these specific child activities.  p  pI know it is possible to traverse the child sub tree of an activity during Validation time when a Constraint can use a GetChildSubtree activiy, but this doesnt give me access to the list at runtime.  I also know its also possible to execute a similar call using ActivityValidationServices from the host application, but that wont work for my scenario either.p  pSo whats the best way to get a list of the activities in the child subtree from within the execution method of a custom activity.p  pThanks in advancep  pMarcus.p

In the context of my code, I have no idea what will happen under the hood if I allocate a bunch of extra threads.  Will the OS copy my chunk of memory from one CPUs memory bank to another  strongThis would impact how much memory I would have to buy raising the cost for this configuration.strong  The ideal situation costwise and easeofprogrammingwise is to have the dual CPU share one large bank of memory, but if I understand correctly, this may not be possible on the new Intel dual core MOBOs like the HP ProLiant ML350ep

Negative 65778 pService composition is a fundamental part of SOA. All of the capabilities offered by a service inventory are expected to utilize other services within that inventory, where necessary, in order to build the task that they are accomplishing from smaller component parts. This is all from an architectural level, though how does this composition happen at the implementation levelp  pConsider this situation. I have a task service which involves posting a codeprocessrequestcode resource that will manage additional resources involved in asynchronously processing a large file to generate the real resource.  Lets call the eventual real resource a PartsInventory.  So, you provide a URL and a name for the PartsInventory to the codeprocessrequestcode service, which then creates a PartsInventory placeholder and kicks off the asynchronous ETL involved in converting the massive csv file at your URL into a real PartsInventory.  If this asynchronous job fails, it will remove the placeholder and queries to the codeprocessrequestcode service will reflect the failure.  If it succeeds, it will remove the placeholder status and queries to the codeprocessrequestcode service will instead redirect you to the PartsInventory resource.p  pNow, how does the implementation of the interaction between codeprocessrequestcode and the PartsInventory emlookem, from a code standpoint  Am I POSTing requests to a published codepartsinventorycode service, or am I calling ORM objects to create the placeholder  If the former, I am abiding by the published contract and am behaving as a consumer of my own services, which seems to fit the composability principlebut it feels really awkward to interact this way from within the same codebase. On the other hand, the latter presumes that the codeprocessrequestcode handler is going to know about how to create a PartsInventory placeholder on its own, which feels awkward in itself. The third option would be to create a specialized static factory method on the PartsInventory object, called something along the lines of codePartsInventory.createplaceholdercode, so that the codeprocessrequestcode code is at least ignorant of the constructor dependencies of a PartsInventory object. This does still separate creation into two locations, though.p  pHave you encountered this Is there a canonical right answer to this questionp

Negative 65778 pI have a MFC class here and im trying to create an automated test for it. I have the added conveniance of never having done MFC before s othats great. Anyway, Im just wondering what would be ways to do it without having to worry too much about a GUI. p  pIts gonna be a simple gui. Just a start button and a stop button. When start is hit, the test will send a load of packets not really packets but lets call them that for simplicity sake to the class that is being tested. This Class will process the packets. The test will end when the stop button is hit.p  pOne guy said to make the GUI invisible and then just use timers to send a start event, then run the test then use a timer to send a stop event. Is that feasible p  pHave people tried other ways or know of other approaches p  pCheersp

Negative 65778 pI have searched around but have yet to find a satisfying answer for my issuep  pOverview I am working on a small app that uses several DateTime fields into a single table using WCF.  We are trying to eliminate null fields in all of our tables.  Up until now, whenever we are converting a datetime field selected from a table we first verify that it is null before we display or otherwise use it.  If the value is NULL, we substitute codeDateTime.MinValuecode for the value.  Since we are now removing the nullable aspect of all fields, we need to insert a common value representing null since codeDateTime.MinValuecode is substituted everywhere in the code, it seems like a viable value to put into the field as a null substitute.p  pThe problem Inserting a codeDateTime.MinValuecode causes the generic problem executing this request error.  p  pSolution  As has been documented elsewhere, the codeDateTime.MinValuecode has an unspecified DateTimeKind so... we add the ToUniversalTime call, as in p  precodeDateTime nullDate  DateTime.MinValue.ToUniversalTime  110001 60000 AM codepre  pThis doesnt work, perhaps because of some acceptable range setting within Date conversions on WCFp  pNoted in the comment is the resulting value of 110001 600 am.  The odd 600am or the year 1 aside, that seems fine. Considering the past of default years like 1200 AM 1970 are still fairly standard, but I digress...p  pYes, I know that DateTime is not C, its .NET.   Im also aware that WCF has some form of min and max times allowed within its conversion constraints.  I dont know how to set those nor do I know how to set the VerboseMessages bit Im fairly new to WCF.p  pThe suggestion to manually create a new field value that converts nicely into the table is viable, and it worksp  precodeDateTime nullDate  new DateTime1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc codepre  pBTW, If we use the year 1 instead of 1970 for example the insert will also fail.p  pEven if we were to use the above nullDate as a workable substitute... the problem is that everywhere in the code we are still evaluating against codeDateTime.MinValuecode representing a null date, and those two dates arent quite the same.p  pThe only viable solution that I can think of is to override or otherwise create an extended class from DateTime to create a common NullDate and modify all the code accordingly.p  pDoes anyone see a good alternative  Does anyone know a solution to inserting the codeSystem.DateTime.MinValuecode into a WCF table such as altering the acceptable boundries of a goodbad datep  pI feel like Im going to have to bite the bullet and change all references to MinValue... Im trying to avoid that because it doesnt follow any sort of standard logical thought in evaluating default values.p  pSuggestions anyonep

Negative 65778 pSo recently we exposed a service to a Java client. Our service utilizes transport security along with usernamepassword validation.p  pWhen attempting to call our service the client was receiving an exception about security headers. Further research indicated that WCF expects a timestamp to be included in the SOAP header passed from client. If this is not present or variance is greater than 5 minutes it will throw an exception.p  pWe also found that Java clients do not pass the timestamp WCF is expected. The only workaround we found was to implement the CustomBinding and set IncludeTimestamp to false. This allowed the client to successfully call the service.p  pToday while looking up best practices for security with WCF I see the following on MSDNp  blockquote   pstrongSet SecurityBindingElement.IncludeTimestamp to True on Custom Bindingsstrongp      pWhen you create a custom binding, you must set IncludeTimestamp to   true. Otherwise, if IncludeTimestamp is set to false, and the client   is using an asymmetric keybased token such as an X509 certificate,   the message will not be signed.p blockquote  pSo, my question is what is the best practice when exposing WCF and eventually Web API services to the outside world while utilizing SSL Transport to non.NET clientsp
Negative 65778 pBelow is the code relevant to the question I am asking. I am working with a cluster that has 13 computenodes and 1 top node a.k.a. main node. The top node is the node that connects all of the users therefore it is alloted more memory so it can run faster. I would like to increase the speed of the other nodes however, because they run quite slowly comparative to the top node, and I would like to increase their speed without making any server andor hardward adjustments. Considering these constraints, I am wondering whether or not there is a way to accomplish faster computing based of how I kickoff the simulations on the compute nodes. Currently, to kick off a part of the simulation with certain initial conditions, this can be seen below I simply ssh onto the compute node and then initiate my simulation. Is there a better way to do this that would increase computation speed I am thinking there might be something faster than ssh. Any help would be greatly appreciated.... I understand there is something called MPI, but for the project I am working on I do not believe that implementing MPI would be necessary if I can just increase the computational speed of the sshd nodes... Thanks.p  pstrong.NodeHopper.shstrongp  precodebinsh NodeHopper uses shell script to run psuedoparallel computing over a cluster  The top node is not named sequentially, so its not in the proceeding loop.

After further investigation, this is not occurring right at application startup rather, it occurs if I create an additional window while the application does not have focus.p  pTo give a bit more background my application is a sort of server, that opens windows in response to network events.  If I boot up the application, then switch focus to something else and a network event comes in while the focus is elsewhere, my application will open a new window in the background not grabbing focus and this blinking will occur.p  pThe windows are codewxFramecodes the application constructs them and their child widgets, then calls codeShowtruecode on the frame.p  pAlso, Ive attempted to set a breakpoint on the codeFlashWindowcode Win32 API function, hoping to trap wherever in WX its getting called, but havent been able to make that work.p

Negative 65778 pHey everybody I know this sounds like a bit of a newb question, but I am new to the concept of using an external Java Script file. p  pI am using Visual Studio 2012 to work on a HTML 5 website and I wrote an external java script file that will be used with my index.html file. I have already linked my Java Script file to my HTML file and am able to use the functions in that file just fine however, I would really like to link the HTML file to my Java Script file that way Intellisense will still work when I am editing the external Java Script file the same way it would work if I was working with an embedded script.p  pFor example say I had a div tag named myAwesomeDiv in my HTML page that I wanted to reference in one of my Java Script functions. If I had this function somewhere in my HTML page I could just start typing myAwesome and Intellisense would come up with that div name as an option which is very handy however, I am using an external Java Script file, so if I started typing that div name while in the JS file nothing would come up because it cant see anything in my HTML file. p  pSo what I am asking is there anyway to link my HTML file to the JS file so that it can look at elements in my HTML file and provide suggestions for me while I am typing inside of my JS filep  pI have already tried referencing the HTML file at the top of my JS file like this.p  precodeltreference pathindex.html gt codepre  pThis didnt seem to do anything for me p  pAny help would greatly be appreciated as I am very spoiled with Intellisense, but I also love the idea of using an external Java Script file.p

Negative 65778 pMy class and I are working on a programming assignment for Java that tests running times for different sorting algorithms.  We generate text files that store different amounts of randomly generated integers.  The sizes are 100, 1000, 10 000, 100 000, 1 000 000.  I am able to run the sorting algorithms correctly on these files but have no idea how to do the next step.p  pWe need to create or modify these text files so only 5 of the random ints are out of place.  I cannot just move the last 5 because it has to be evenly distributed.  Also, he said when disordering these files, that an integer that has been moved out of place should not be moved again to prevent the occurrence of it being moved back where it was.  Anyone have any ideas how I would do this  Thanks.p

Negative 65778 pI am still fairly new to the threading model in .net 4.5 or threading in general for that matter.  I am trying to build a set of abstract classes in order to implement a framework for multithreading a series similar tasks.  The rules are that the first line of the input tells how many problems are in the set, and the following lines contain the input for each problem.  How many lines of input make up a set can vary from one task to the next, but are normally consistent for a given type of problem.  Each problem is to have a single line of text as its output.p  pThe goal is to be able to inherit from these classes and only have to worry about implementing the CreateWorker and DoWork methods.  The UI will call ProcessInput to get things started, and WriteOutput to list off the results.p  pThe basic template I have so far isp  precodepublic abstract class Wrapper      protected int N     protected WorkerBase[] ProblemSet     protected ListltTaskgt Tasks      public virtual void ProcessInputTextReader input              string Line  input.ReadLine         N  int.ParseLine         ProblemSet  new WorkerBase[N]         Tasks new ListltTaskgtN         for int index  0 index lt N index                      WorkerBase T  CreateWorkerinput             Tasks.AddT.DoWorkAsync             ProblemSet[index]  T                    public virtual bool WriteOutputTextWriter outputStream, int timeout              bool Complete  Task.WaitAllTasks.ToArray, timeout          for int index  0 index lt N index                      outputStream.WriteLineProblemSet[index].Result                   return Complete           protected abstract WorkerBase CreateWorkerTextReader inputStream     protected abstract class WorkerBase              public string Result                      get             protected set                  protected abstract void DoWork         public Task DoWorkAsync                      return Task.Run gt DoWork                 codepre  pAs is, this is meeting my requirements.  But now I would like to add abort functionality to the Wrapper class which is capable of halting all of the threads.  So the question is, how do I work the abort functionality into this structure in such a way that my UI can abort the process if a cancel button is clicked  Preferably without having to write extra code in the DoWork implementation.p  pI have found patterns which pass in a cancelation token in order to abort the task, but every version I have found would require that DoWork check the state of the token and abort itself.  I really want a way to abort DoWork from outside the method.p

Negative 65778 pList,p  pI have actually searched extensively on this topic and either a I dont know how to configure something andor b I dont quite understand what a JNDI Realm actually is supposed to do.  I am using Tomcat 7.0.32 with jdk 1.7.015.p  pHere is what I want to do.  I work with customers that use PKI User Certificates.  The user certificates have a cn like Joe Smith.  What I need to be able to do is look up this CN in LDAP and get the users id, which may be something like jsmith23, and populate the Principal user in the request header.  The reason for this is I have an application deployed in Tomcat that specifically makes a call for getRemoteUser and this id e.g. jsmith23 must be populated correctly.  This application is sort of like a web adaptor for another third party tool, which consequently checks LDAP again.  However, it must be this userid.p  pI have tried many things, but I cant seem to get past the LDAP lookup.

Negative 65778 pIm having a really hard time conceptualising how I can connect to the the twitter streaming api and process tweets via an admin interface provided by Django.p  pThe main problem is starting a daemon from Django and having the ability to stopstart it, plus making sure there is provision for monitoring.  I dont really want to use upstart for this purpose because I want to try and keep the project as self contained as possible.p  pIm currently attempting the following and am unsure if its perhaps the wrong way to go about thingsp  ul liStart a celery task from Django which establishes a persistent connection to the streaming APIli liThe above task creates subtasks which will process tweets and store themli liBecause celeryd runs as a daemon it will automatically run the first task again if the connection breaks and the task fails  does this mean I dont need any additional monitoringli ul  pDoes the above make sense or have I misunderstood how celery worksp

Negative 65778 pOur specific project is for Windows Phone, but I assume this question applies equally to all xamlbased projects. Weve got a bunch of image assets that are used at designtime only, and dont want them as part of the released build. If possible, wed prefer they werent part of codeDebugcode configuration builds, either. Does anyone have a best practice on how to go about doing thisp  pOne solution is to continue including the images in the project, but set the Build Action to codeNonecode. The problem with this is that its easy to forget, since the default for images is to include them as codeContentcode.p  pTheoretically, another solution is to add these images to an assembly thats only referenced in Debug builds, but I havent tested it out yet. I dont know if Blend or the VS designer will work well with that solution, and wed rather not have the images as part of Debug builds anyway.p

Negative 65778 pIm thinking about writing a REST adapter for MongoDB in C or C. It would take a declarative config file and expose REST endpoints accordingly.

Negative 65778 pI want to overlap some elements without using codeposition absolutecode. The reason therefore is that I have several vertical sections which should not overlap containing elements which overlap. The problem is, I cannot know beforehand whether the overlapping or the overlapped element has the bigger size. If one of those would receive a codeposition absolutecode it would be taken out of flow and therefore the parent container would not be sized accordingly and the sections would overlap. I have already found this question but nobody seemed to answer the question. Here is an example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnNhtU relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnNhtUap

Negative 65778 pAuto Layout, as good as it is, driving me crazy with constraints. I have the portrait mode designed in IB but I cant get the desired landscape orientation to work. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZHPid.jpg altlayoutp  pNotice that when the orientation changes to landscape, the spacing between the UIImageView blocks decreases and the text alignment of codeSAMPLE TEXTcode changes to right aligned. p  pCurrently, I have added a few constraints for it to work. However, I need to keep the space between UIImageView blocks fixed, as a result of which it looks cramped up in portrait and fine in landscape. I need it to be spread out evenly in portrait and compress in landscape like in image above. Similarly, currently my constraints bring up the text but it doesnot keep it at the center of screen and right aligned. p  pIs this possible at all with Auto Layout If so, how Help greatly appreciated.p

Negative 65778 pIm wondering if theres a way to load a JSON file without having to use AJAX with jQuery.

Negative 65778 pIm really not sure how to explain this properly, but let me try.  I have a C program that is listening to data on a CAN bus communication bus for vehicles.  Every 1 second, I receive a new message off the bus that contains diagnostic information about error messages.  The message is not fixed length, so the message one time may contain 5 faults, and the next time it may contain 3 faults.  The message comes from two or more different sources, each one of them sends it every 1 second.  In my UI, I need to display the list of active faults by cycling through them at a rate of 1 per every 5 seconds.p  pHeres my question.  How do I efficiently keep a list updated with the latest information  Adding to the list is no problem, but how do I remove an item that should no longer be in the list  In other words, if I only receive 3 faults in the message, that means that 2 of them do not exist anymore.  The only thing that I can come up with is using timestamps and a bunch of for loops to compare the 2 messages and addremoveupdate the list.  Is there something more efficient that already exists for this sort of thingp  pEDIT  To clarify, I need to remove items from the list because those faults are no longer active.  If I have an array as followsp  precode Message that is received psudo code Fault newFaults1[5]  Fault1, Fault2, Fault3, Fault4, Fault5  Fault newFaults2[7]  Fault1, Fault2, Fault3, Fault4, Fault5, Fault6, Fault7    Populate the array that holds both array values for int i  0 i  lt newFaults1.Count i     Faults[i]  newFaults1[i]  for int i  0 i lt newFaults2.Count i     Faults[i  newFaults1.Count]  newFaults2[i]   Now, the next time a message is received, there are fewer faults. Fault newFaults1[2]  Fault1, Fault2  Fault newFaults2[1]  Fault1    TODO How do I remove all of the old items in the Faults array codepre

Negative 65778 pI am currently working on a Node.js server. This server uses Edge.js to execute my C workflow code it is a dll. p  pWe are using a custom written logging dll that logs to a SQL Server table. Node.js and my Workflow dll use this logging dll to log steps to the SQL databse. Ideally it would just need to open the connection to the SQL database once and then reuse it for Node and Edgec code.p  pstrongIs there some way of opening the connection in the Node.js code and then passing that connection handle around to EdgeC. Or is there a better way to do thisstrongp  pAt the moment I am just opening the connection when I call my c Workflow dll and then closing it at the end. Doing this in Node causes some problems assuming because of async code System.InvalidOperationException ExecuteNonQuery requires an open and available Connection. The connections current state is open..p

Negative 65778 pI have a problem in that my scenario requires that I send potentially large files to a WCF data service. There appears to be a 48k limit for an HTTP request by default with IIS though this can be changed to a much large value via configuration. However this is a security feature to prevent DoS attacks. Also, I dont have any control over the IIS server deployed to even though the installation process might be able to set an initial value for this.p  pThe data being sent is already zipped and generally will be lower than 48k, so possibly a bit of an edge case, but potentially a user loses a lot of work if they cannot upload their data.p  pI thought about sending the data up in chunks but then I am losing this functionalityp  precodecontext.SaveChangesSaveChangesOptions.ReplaceOnUpdate  SaveChangesOptions.Batch codepre  pAny idea of options WCF data services not suitable for this, anything else, traditional web service Can the above still be achieved using alternate code but the same technology.

Negative 65778 pThere is no direct support for a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTaggedunion relnofollowvariant typesa aka tagged unions, discriminated unions in C. However one can go with a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVisitorpattern relnofollowvisitor patterna that enables discrimination via doubledispatching and guarantees that all cases are addressed at the compile time. However its tedious to implement. I wonder if there is more effortless way to get strongsome sort of variants with a discrimination mechanism that guarantees that all cases of a union are addressed at the compile time in Cstrongp  precode This is a variant type. At each single time it can only hold one case a value  from a predefined set of cases. All classes that implement this interface  consitute the set of the valid cases of the variant. So at each time a variant can  be an instance of one of the classes that implement this interface. In order to  add a new case to the variant there must be another class that implements  this interface. public interface ISomeAnimal       This method introduces the currently held case to whoever usesprocesses      the variant. By processing we mean that the case is turned into a resulting      value represented by the generic type TResult.     TResult GetProcessedltTResultgtISomeAnimalProcessorltTResultgt processor    This is the awkward part, the visitor that is required every time we want to  to process the variant. For each possible case this processor has a corresponding  method that turns that case to a resulting value. public interface ISomeAnimalProcessorltTResultgt      TResult ProcessCatCat cat     TResult ProcessFishFish fish    A case that represents a cat from the ISomeAnimal variant. public class Cat  ISomeAnimal      public CatsHead Head  get set      public CatsBody Body  get set      public CatsTail Tail  get set      public IEnumerableltCatsLeggt Legs  get set      public TResult GetProcessedltTResultgtISomeAnimalProcessorltTResultgt processor               a processor has a method for each case of a variant, for this          particular case being a cat we always pick the ProcessCat method         return processor.ProcessCatthis         A case that represents a fish from the ISomeAnimal variant. public class Fish  ISomeAnimal      public FishHead Head  get set      public FishBody Body  get set      public FishTail Tail  get set      public TResult GetProcessedltTResultgtISomeAnimalProcessorltTResultgt processor               a processor has a method for each case of a variant, for this          particular case being a fish we always pick the ProcessCat method         return processor.ProcessFishthis        public static class AnimalPainter       Now, in order to process a variant, in this case we want to      paint a picture of whatever animal it prepresents, we have to      create a new implementation of ISomeAnimalProcessor interface      and put the painting logic in it.      public static void AddAnimalToPicturePicture picture, ISomeAnimal animal              var animalToPictureAdder  new AnimalToPictureAdderpicture         animal.GetProcessedanimalToPictureAdder            Making a new visitor every time you need to process a variant      1. Requires a lot of typing.      2. Bloats the type system.      3. Makes the code harder to maintain.      4. Makes the code less readable.     private class AnimalToPictureAdder  ISomeAnimalProcessorltNothinggt              private Picture picture          public AnimalToPictureAdderPicture picture                      this.picture  picture                   public Nothing ProcessCatCat cat                      this.picture.AddBackgroundnew SomeHouse             this.picture.Addcat.Body             this.picture.Addcat.Head             this.picture.Addcat.Tail             this.picture.AddAllcat.Legs             return Nothing.AtAll                   public Nothing ProcessFishFish fish                      this.picture.AddBackgroundnew SomeUnderwater             this.picture.Addfish.Body             this.picture.Addfish.Tail             this.picture.Addfish.Head             return Nothing.AtAll                 codepre

Negative 65778 pWhen writing contextmenu shell extensions, I like the approach of just capturing the list of selected files on which the user rightclicked, and then pass them to an external program in some way. The main work is done in the external program, which has its own GUI, and runs in a separate process. The shell extension code just passes the list of selected files to the external program.p  pIt seems to me that this approach is followed also by other utilities, like 7zip.p  pBut would it be possible to create e.g. a dialogbox directly from inside the shell extension, inside Explorer process My understanding is that the code in the shell extension should try to do as few things as possible, and return the control to Explorer, to not hang Explorer process.p  pIf I create a dialogbox inside the shell extension handler e.g. in my implementation of codeIContextMenuInvokeCommandcode, what would be the right approach to followp  pAssuming that in dialogbox codeOnInitDialogcode implementation I setup the GUI of the dialogbox, should I then call something like codeDoMainWorkcode, and inside this method insert a message loop to process messagesbr e.g.p  precode 1.

Negative 65778 pI used old Eclipse Helios and old Tomcat 5.5 for a large web project. After updating to Tomcat 6, this code stopped workingp  precodeshort foo  3 Integer bar  foo codepre  pApparently, this is invalid code according to the Java language specification[1], and there was a bug in the old Eclipse compiler so it didnt report it. New Eclipse Kepler reports it as an error.p  pIm not quite sure why it stopped working with new Tomcat since it is using the same Java compiler as the old Tomcat, but the code is invalid and I want to fix it throughout the project. p  pFirst I tried validating the entire project in new Eclipse so it would list all .jsp files with this error. However, this validation in Eclipse doesnt seem to work very well since sometimes it detects several existing errors in a file and sometimes reports no errors in the same file without changes, 10 seconds later.p  pNext thing I tried was to import project to NetBeans 7.4 and try to list those errors here. When I open a file with error, it detects it codeincompatible types short cannot be converted to Integercode. However, when I list all errors in the Action Items list, I cant find those errors although I set the filter to include compiler errors.p  pI thought that listing all Java errors in all JSP files in a project would be easy, but turned out that it wasnt.

Negative 65778 pI need to combine directory watching with event hijacking. Basically, I want my Python program to listen to a directory and its subdirs for when a user doubleclicks i.e. opensacesses the file. At that point, I want my prgm to stop the events propagation and obtain a reference to the file.p  pIn short for some arbitrary directory, I want all attempts at file access to come through my program first, at which point I can do what I want without interference from Windows. How can this be donep  pBackground already delved into pywin32 and it seems that even the underlying windows os filesystem api doesnt have a generic file access notifier. while it claims to be there, testing reveals that for most programs calling open on a file, the file access timestamp is not updated unless that file is modified or saved. Really, I want something like inotify, but in all the windows ported versions ive found this INOPEN notification is stripped. Im assuming this has to do with the underlying Windows api, but maybe Im missing something...p  pThanks,p  pEDIT Oops, didnt realize this might sound spammy... The reason I need to access the file open event is so that a user can open a stub file which contains only metadata. This stub is then used to generate a temp file which is what ends up being passed to the appropriate application. On save, the files contents are pushed to a decentralized, cloud storage backend. At no point does the user really have the ability to own a document on the machine. So, hijacking the file open is for 1 constructing a file with actual contents 2 opening that file with the correct applicationp

Negative 65778 pIn AppDelegate I have an NSMutableArray with a set of classes that are processed in a background method songs being played.  That part of the Application is working fine.  I setup the delegate method and receive status on the work at the conclusion of each item of the array.  I wanted to add an NSSlider to display the status of each array item being processed.  I tested the slider on a single entity from within the AppDelegate and got the results I expected.  The problem is when Im processing the queue the NSTimer is not firing until the unit of work is completed as if delayed.  I suspect Im not scheduling it properly because the timer worked on a single song with the same code from within AppDelegate. p  h3AppDelegate.hh3  precodeinterface AppDelegate  NSObject ltNSApplicationDelegate, NSTableViewDataSource,     NSTableViewDelegate, NSSharingServiceDelegate,     NSSharingServicePickerDelegate, SongPlayerDelegategt  void songPlayerSongPlayer player didSomethingDesktopEntity entity void songPlayerSongPlayer player updateSliderdoubleresult codepre  h3ApplDelegate.mh3  precodevoidpreviewQueueDesktopEntity entity        schedule work     queuePlayer  [[SongPlayer alloc] init]     queuePlayer.delegate  self     [queuePlayer performSelectorInBackgroundselectorplayMyQueue withObjectqueue]  codepre  h3SongPlayer.hh3  precodeprotocol SongPlayerDelegate interface SongPlayer  NSObject  idltSongPlayerDelegategt unsafeunretained delegate  property nonatomic, assign idltSongPlayerDelegategt delegate idplayMyQueueNSMutableArray end  protocol SongPlayerDelegate ltNSObjectgt  voidsongPlayerSongPlayer player didSomethingidenity  voidsongPlayerSongPlayer player updateSliderdoubleresult end id playMyQueueidentity        NSDictionary dict  [DesktopSoundEntity entity tagDictionary]     NSString dur  [dict objectForKeykTagDuration]     songDurration  [dur doubleValue]     then  [NSDate date]     if myTimer          [myTimer invalidate]         myTimer  nil          myTimer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval0.75 targetself             selectorselectorupdateTimer userInfonil repeatsYES]      [self playSong]     [self passBackURLentity]     return nil   voidupdateTimerNSTimer timer      double now  [then timeIntervalSinceNow]1     NSLognowgt f, now     double sec  now  songDurration 100     NSLognowgt f, sec     if sec gt 100          [myTimer invalidate]         myTimer  nil          NSLogSLIDER SHOULD BE UPDATING     [self.delegate songPlayerself updateSlidersec]  codepre  pThe slider isnt updated until the playMyQueue method completes, I see the bar jump and I get the NSLog message.

Negative 65778 pIve looked at several similar QampAs but nothing quite matched what Im after unless I misunderstood.p  pI have written a query with a parameter requiring the week number, but I have the dropdown for the selection display the week start date to make it more user friendly.

Negative 65778 pI have created a workflow system where users can see their work in a queue, mark it complete, and create an outgoing correspondence letter. In the Access DB, essentially they are going into each record which has an Incomplete indicator and marking items as Complete from the queue table.  After doing this, an insert is triggered, which inserts customer data based on that record being marked into a letter table.  A pdf is then batchedprinted based on the inserted data from this letter table.p  pThe beginning scope of the project was a single transaction type with essentially limited data fields Such as Name, Address, State, Zip.  I am finding now that I am being asked to expand the transaction types in the queue.  Different letters however, require different fields and not all fields are readily available for each letter Some letters need and have an account issued date, others do not, etc.p  pMy question pertains to the methodology of expanding the fields available for letter insert.  I need to add more fields for the new transaction types in the letter table.  But these fields are transaction specific, so for example, I may have some kind of audit letter that does not use account premiums, but now I have another transaction that uses only account premiums.  All my letters in the table will share that field if I create it, regardless of whether they actually use it or not. So if that is the case, how should I deal with the nulls I am wondering if I should still create the field aptly named such as AccountPremium, or should i use generic names like extraField1 and just match it to the point in the letter  p

Negative 65778 pAn application I am working on is exhibiting some strange behaviour that I cannot explain when it saves data. The application uses a custom c data layer. When a save is made, it inserts data into a table variable then executes a stored procedure to save the data, passing the table variable as a parameter. The save works when the application runs, but when I profile the sql that is running, I cannot execute the queries in SSMS because of a conversion failure to datetime. An example of the SQL recorded by profiler is below, Ive added in the table variable as well for reference.p  ptable variable...p  precodeCREATE TYPE [dbo].[ExampleType] AS TABLE     [Name] [nvarchar]200 NOT NULL DEFAULT ,     [CreationDate] [datetime] NULL,     [UpdateDate] [datetime] NULL  codepre  psql from profiler...p  precodedeclare p1 dbo.ExampleType insert into p1 valuesN,20140129 094818.8000000,20140129 100531.9647267  exec [dbo].[saveExample] tableParameterp1 codepre  pWhen the application is running, I can see the saved data in the table and the datetimes are truncated to the datetime format i.e. the last 4 characters are removed and the data is saved.

Negative 65778 pIm the author of a PHP web application that provides a dashboard and control panel for its users environments. p  pFor context, the architecture is roughly as followsp  ul liapache webserver w PHP 5.4 handling user interface requestsli liMYSQL 5.5 percona storing data about user environmentsli liSOAP service hosted by a separate system that allows Northbound Interface NBI requests to affect user environmentsli lia separate parsing system that interprets changes to users environments and updates the database according to changes detected.li ul  pWhen a user logs into the web application, their environment is loaded up from the database and displayed. The user interface is kept up2date with AJAX polling requests to the PHP server. I have rigged up these requests to not stack by keeping the connection state stored in a JS boolean so that whenever the poll interval is triggered, subsequent requests do not stack up. i.e. The subsequent requests are skipped until the active request completes.p  pIn addition to polling to keep the interface up to date, the SOAP service can be utilized via AJAX request to the PHP server, triggering a synchronous SOAPClient request to the NBI from the server, to perform operations that affect the users environments. When a change is made over these requests, the parsing system eventually picks up the change, and updates the database, causing the polling mechanism to update the interface, completing the operation from the point of view of the user.p  pThe userinitiated AJAX requests that perform NBI calls can last a substantial amount of time, sometimes even more than a minute before the SOAP request is released, and the status of the SOAPrequested operation is returned to the AJAX request that triggered it.p  pIn the users GUI, Im locking down other AJAX requests including the polls, while one of these operations is ongoing, ensuring only a single AJAX request is active at a time. p  pstrongHeres the problemstrong If this request is CANCELLED by xhr.abort, the server side request to the NBI call remains open until completion. While the completion is pending, if the user attempts to navigate elsewhere or perform another operation or poll, the request is held up until the server completes the original cancelled request. p  pTo be clear The hold up seems to be SERVERSIDE, as there is no ongoing concurrent AJAX or otherwise request limit being hit in the browser. p  pUntil the server finishes its SOAP client request triggered by the aborted AJAX request, further requests from the same browser are held up, it seems, at the server.p  pI understand that killing the AJAX request mid stream does not kill the request at the server, but why is the server holding up further requests until after the AJAX request that triggered the NBI call is abortedp

Just so you can visualize it, here is the original image p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfb5oY.png altenter image description herep  pAnd the image to fade to p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0b3mp.png altenter image description herep  pI could still change these images a bit, but thats the general idea.p  pHow would I go about creating this fading effect Im picturing something using timers and opacity settings, but I dont know how any of that stuff could help me solve this.p  pE Heres a bit of code I have. It changes from image to image when I hover, but its not a fade, and it looks very choppy.p  precode    private void pictureBox3MouseEnterobject sender, EventArgs e              pictureBox3.Image  pictureBox37.Image           private void pictureBox3MouseLeaveobject sender, EventArgs e              pictureBox3.Image  pictureBox38.Image      codepre  pcodepictureBox37 and pictureBox38code are invisible reference pictureboxes with the images I need.p
Negative 65778 pI have a repository that contains the code for an old version of a website that is no longer being used on codemastercode. The site was completely redesigned in a new repository, and the code and history from that repository was copied over into a branch in the repo of the old site, lets call it codenewsitecode. I cant merge codenewsitecode into codemastercode, since the histories are entirely different. p  pIve investigated both submodules and subtree merges a bit, but both seem to only be relevant when youre trying to keep code from one project contained in a subdirectory of another project, not when you want to stick two working trees on top of each other.p  pAt this point, I would like to have the old code remain where it is, and just append codenewsitecode on top of the current HEAD. Any idea how I can accomplish this, or alternate suggestions for cleaning up this mess without blowing away the old codep
Negative 65778 pIm fairly new to android and I participate in a course on the coursera website. I have an application that needed to work on tablets in twopane mode and on normal devices in onepane mode. As one of bonus exercises I needed to maintain the state in twopane mode when device orientation changes remember which item was selected incodeListFragmentcode on left side and what text was displayed in codeFragmentcode on right side.p  pI eventually made this exercise, however what I noticed is that application doesnt properly destroy ListFragment  look on log. Log output was cleared after application was run, its just from orientation change.p  pAs you can see fragment was destroyed, but then android attached it again from nowhere.p  pI included only code for onepane code and layout  problem is directly there. Twopane layout works properly.p  precode0210 071920.845 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onPause 0210 071920.845 IDEBUG1297 Activity onPause 0210 071920.855 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onStop 0210 071920.855 IDEBUG1297 Activity onStop 0210 071920.855 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onDestroyView 0210 071920.875 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onDestroy 0210 071920.875 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onDetach 0210 071920.905 IDEBUG1297 Activity onDestroy 0210 071921.115 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onAttach 0210 071921.115 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onCreate 0210 071921.115 IDEBUG1297 Activity onCreate 0210 071921.315 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onCreateView 0210 071921.455 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onActivityCreated 0210 071921.466 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onAttach 0210 071921.466 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onCreate 0210 071921.466 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onCreateView 0210 071921.535 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onActivityCreated 0210 071921.535 IDEBUG1297 Activity onStart 0210 071921.535 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onStart 0210 071921.535 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onStart 0210 071921.555 IDEBUG1297 Activity onResum 0210 071921.555 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onResume 0210 071921.555 IDEBUG1297 ListFragment onResume codepre  blockquote   pstrongMainActivity.javastrongp blockquote  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity implements         FriendsFragment.SelectionListener       private static final String TAG  LabFragments     private static final String DEBUG  DEBUG     private static final String STRINGDEBUG  Activity       private FriendsFragment mFriendsFragment     private FeedFragment mFeedFragment      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onCreate         setContentViewR.layout.mainactivity          If the layout is singlepane, create the FriendsFragment           and add it to the Activity          if isInTwoPaneMode                          if mFriendsFragment  null TO REMOVE                 mFriendsFragment  new FriendsFragment                           TODO 1  add the FriendsFragment to the fragmentcontainer             FragmentTransaction transaction  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction             transaction.addR.id.fragmentcontainer, mFriendsFragment             transaction.commit                  else                Otherwise, save a reference to the FeedFragment for later use             mFeedFragment  FeedFragment getFragmentManager.findFragmentByIdR.id.feedfrag                     If there is no fragmentcontainer ID, then the application is in      twopane mode      private boolean isInTwoPaneMode          return findViewByIdR.id.fragmentcontainer  null            Display selected Twitter feed      public void onItemSelectedint position           Log.iTAG, Entered onItemSelected  position             If there is no FeedFragment instance, then create one          if mFeedFragment  null             mFeedFragment  new FeedFragment           If in singlepane mode, replace single visible Fragment          if isInTwoPaneMode               TODO 2  replace the fragmentcontainer with the FeedFragment             FragmentTransaction transaction  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction             transaction.replaceR.id.fragmentcontainer, mFeedFragment             transaction.addToBackStacknull             transaction.commit              execute transaction now             getFragmentManager.executePendingTransactions                    Update Twitter feed display on FriendFragment         mFeedFragment.updateFeedDisplayposition            Override     public void onStart          super.onStart         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onStart           Override     public void onResume          super.onResume         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onResum           Override     public void onPause          super.onPause         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onPause           Override     public void onStop          super.onStop         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onStop           public void onRestart          super.onRestart         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onRestart           Override     public void onDestroy          super.onDestroy         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onDestroy       codepre  blockquote   pstrongListFragment.java  FriendsFragmentstrongp blockquote  precodepublic class FriendsFragment extends ListFragment       private static final String[] FRIENDS   ladygaga, msrebeccablack, taylorswift13      private static final String TAG  LabFragments     private static final String DEBUG  DEBUG     private static final String STRINGDEBUG  ListFragment      private int currentIndex  1      public interface SelectionListener          public void onItemSelectedint position           private SelectionListener mCallback      Override     public void onAttachActivity activity          super.onAttachactivity         Log.iDEBUG, STRINGDEBUG  onAttach          Make sure that the hosting Activity has implemented          the SelectionListener callback interface.

Negative 65778 pIm creating a quiz that uses radio buttons to let the user select their answer. Id like to set the value of the radio buttons to the answer i.e. Q Whats the capital of Spain radio button value Madrid. I have no problem doing this when the answer is a number or a oneword string, but strings with spaces only return the first word of the string as the radio buttons value.p  pThe answers are stored in an array and Im iterating through it to populate the quiz choices.p  precodefor var j  0 j lt answers.length j              var radio  ltinput typeradio value  answers[j]   namechoice gt             As.appendradio.appendanswers[j].appendltbr gt          codepre  pThe problem is that when checking to see if the users answer is right, Im comparing the value of the radio button they checked with the actual answer. For multiple word answers, the user selected value comes in as firstword while the answer might be firstword secondword thirdword. These arent equal and the user unfairly misses a point. p  pIve worked around this by simply setting the radio buttons value to j and then later comparing answers[j] to the correct answer works great, but is there any way to directly set the radio buttons value to a string that contains spaces, or is there any other way one might implement this better Is it not good practice for a radio buttons value to be a multiword string I couldnt find it explicitly stated that a value couldnt contain spaces but that seems to be the case.p

Negative 65778 pI am working on a word cloud C program that is suppose to populate a list of words from a text file, put the words in a linked list, then sort the list by frequency and print the list with only one instance of the words and the frequency next to the word.p  pWhat I have accomplished is reading the file, populating the linked list, and printing it. However I cannot get the list to print from main instead of the wordCloud method codeloadWordCloudcode.  I am not strong with classes yet, so I am sure that is my problem.  But basically I want to call the codeprintWordCloudcode method from main instead of printing from codeloadWordCloudcode.  When I put codegetList.printWordCloudcode after I call codegetList.loadWordCloudmyFilecode, I get an empty list.

No matter what I do, it looks like the screenshot below..p  pI also have discovered that when I dont apply a font to the label, alignment works as I would expect  it is vertically aligned with the image. p  pSo the question is, a why in the world does applying a font screw up the alignment, and b how do I get around this, ideally in a dynamic way that will adapt if i change the font at runtime..p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfVU5y.png altenter image description herep  precode idinitWithFrameNSRectframeRect      self  [super initWithFrameframeRect]     if self          NSView spacer1  [[NSView alloc] init]         [spacer1 setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsNO]         [self addSubviewspacer1]          NSView spacer2  [[NSView alloc] init]         [spacer2 setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsNO]         [self addSubviewspacer2]          NSImage icon  [NSImage imageNamed05arrowwest]         NSImageView iconView  [[NSImageView alloc] init]         [iconView setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsNO]         [iconView setImageicon]          [self addSubviewiconView]          NSFont font  [NSFont fontWithNameHelveticaNeueLight size14]         NSTextField label  [[NSTextField alloc] init]         [label setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsNO]         [label setEditableNO]         [label setSelectableNO]         [label setBezeledNO]         [label setDrawsBackgroundNO]          [label setFontfont]         [label setTextColor[NSColor lightGrayColor]]         [label setStringValueTest String]           [self addSubviewlabel]          NSDictionary views  NSDictionaryOfVariableBindingsiconView, label, spacer1, spacer2          [self addConstraints                 [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatH[spacer1gt0][iconView]5[label][spacer2spacer1]                                                         options 0                                                         metricsnil                                                           viewsviews]]          [self addConstraints                 [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatV[iconView]                                                         options 0                                                         metricsnil                                                           viewsviews]]          [self addConstraints                 [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatV[label]                                                         options 0                                                         metricsnil                                                           viewsviews]]          [self setContentHuggingPriority200 forOrientationNSLayoutConstraintOrientationVertical]         [iconView setContentHuggingPriority200 forOrientationNSLayoutConstraintOrientationVertical]         [label setContentHuggingPriority200 forOrientationNSLayoutConstraintOrientationVertical]           return self  codepre

However as soon as this code runs on a native windows 8.1 version and IE with the same version for OS and IE, the post forgets to put out the post payload no matter whether I put the above header attributes in or not. p  pAnd yes a chrome browser on native win 8.1 properly puts the payload to the server, while the native IE 11 does not put the payload out. The receiving server linux based restlet is missing the payload for the specified resource so further returns a 500 status at the application layer. p  pThere must be some configuration difference with respect to the IE on the native and the VM. As far as I can see this is different from what similar question have described. p  pBTW on the same native windows 8.1 some posts are working that address a form already created on the web pages, while the above form date is simply filled as.     form  optionsencodeURIComponentoptionsp  pAny idea where the different behaviour is createdp  pThanks  p

Negative 65778 pI am working on a task system where i want some process isolation, for which I am spinning up a child console app for executing some unknown code. Basically the child process  isolation part I want opaque viaavis the parent app  process. I am trying to get the same environment setup in the child process as the parent  the last pain with that is the app.config.p  pIdeally Id like the parent process app.config to be read  available in the child console app. To that end, the best 2 ways Ive found so farp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6150644changedefaultappconfigatruntime61516886151688Change default app.config at runtimeap  pThis probably works havent tested  but I am a bit uncomfortable with this since this is touching fixed internals.p  pAnd the code Ive got belowp  precodeprivate static void LoadConfigstring configPath      var targetConfig  ConfigurationManager.OpenMappedExeConfigurationnew ExeConfigurationFileMap  ExeConfigFilename  configPath , ConfigurationUserLevel.None      var sectionList  targetConfig.Sections.Keys.Castltstringgt      foreach ConfigurationSectionGroup part in targetConfig.SectionGroups              sectionList  sectionList.Concatpart.Sections.Keys.Castltstringgt.Selectk gt part.Name    k             targetConfig.SaveAsConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfigurationConfigurationUserLevel.None.FilePath, ConfigurationSaveMode.Full      foreach var x in sectionList              ConfigurationManager.RefreshSectionx       codepre  pThis works for me as well  since I can happily overwrite the client console config file. The pain is the stupid .RefreshSection method  it only refreshes fullynamed  specific sections. For example  if I have a system.serviceModel entry .RefreshSectionsystem.serviceModel doesnt work  just silently passes It needs .RefreshSectionsystem.serviceModelclient, and all such sections with a full path, so Id have to traverse the entire SectionGroup tree and build paths for all sections I am only doing it in the above code for 1 level and refresh each individually  which seems stupidly tedious.p  pAny better approach I could take or something I am missing  messing upp

Negative 65778 pI am developing a website which has a chat feature and requires instant notifications when a user receives a new message.  I am trying to decide whether to use a Ratchet server or implement a long polling system with AJAX.  I have currently implemented a basic PubSub Ratchet server which works fine when delivering notifications while a user remains on the Chat page on my site.  My problem here is that the connection is closed whenever the user moves to any other page, and I need to recreate a connection to the server.  I am aware that there are possible solutions such as having the websocket connection exist within an IFrame which is always displayed, however I do not want to go down this path if I do not have to.  Would a better approach be to implement long polling with AJAX  I am concerned that if I continually recreate a users connection to the Ratchet server whenever they change pages within the site, it will add too much overhead when the site is under heavy usage thousands of users at a time.  Does anyone have experience in this area with Ratchet serversp  pThanks.p

Negative 65778 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am running a Matlab script that creates a mesh geometry stored within a .m file all of this is for running with a finite element solver. I give it a number of elements, and it creates a mesh of quadrilaterals that fit within a boundary two examples of the geometry are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. When I use it for only a single number of elements, it works great. On the other hand, when I try to use the meshgenerating script within a loop, varying the number of desired elements n  1,2,4,...32,64, the file reads as though I just ran it at n  1. Its as if the .m file was not rewritten.p  pimg srchttpi1374.photobucket.comalbumsag415dlgonzalMesh10zps65dfea29.png altMesh with 10 elements Figure 1.

Negative 65778 pIm using Qt 5.2 and I would like to make a codeQLineEditcode not editable. The problem with this is, that it doesnt appear like it. When using codesetReadOnlytruecode it stays with white background and looks like it is still editable.p  pIf I disable it, then it turns gray and the text also gets a lighter gray. The problem is, that one can not copy the text from it, in a disabled state.p  pSo how can I make a codeQLineEditcode properly noneditable and also make it look like it. In Windows such a control is usually gray, but the text stays black. Of course I could set the style manually, but this means that it is hardcoded and may look wrong on other platforms.p

How would I go about doing this I think I need to rethink my use of dependency properties...p  pstrong UPDATEstrongp  pSo I made a codeGraphLinecode class which should represent a line on the graph. The graph is actually a codeChartPlottercode element in the codeGraphWindowPresenter.xamlcode class. Additionally, I specified a codeDataTypecode for the codeGraphLinecode objects, but that is all I understand. What are the next steps to this, how do I actually add the data to the graph And howwhere do I make instances of codeGraphLinecode to populate the codeChartPlottercode element Sorry I am pretty lost on this, even after reading quite a few tutorials.

Negative 65778 pThe famous a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comdocumentd1XXMvReO8Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821EspubBest Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structurea blog post outlines the new recommended angularjs project structure which is now componentoriented, not functionallyoriented, or as named in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comyeomangeneratorangularissues109initial github issuea  Organized by Feature.p  pThe blogpost suggests that each file inside each module should start with the module name, e.g.p  precodeuserlogin     userlogin.js     userlogin.css                     userlogin.html                     userlogindirective.js     userlogindirectivetest.js     userloginservice.js     userloginservicetest.js  codepre  pThe question is what is the point, pros and cons of repeating the module name inside each filename in the module as opposed to having the files named functionally For examplep  precodeuserlogin     userlogin.js     userlogin.css                     userlogin.html        controllers.js                  directives.js     services.js codepre  hr  pThe reason I ask is that Im coming from a a hrefhttpswww.djangoproject.comcodeDjangocodea world where there is a somewhat similar idea of having a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevrefapplicationsprojects and appsa. Each app usually has its own codemodels.pycode, codeviews.pycode, codeurls.pycode, codetests.pycode. There is no repeating app name inside the script names.p  pI hope Im not crossing an opinionbased line and there is a legitimate reason for following the approach.p

Negative 65778 pIs there any documentation on how to build a custom notification server for Android I am currently using GCM but due to the nature of the app and the fact that notifications are a very important feature in my app, I would rather implement this service internally so that I can control the throughput and not have any artificial limitations even if its hundreds of thousands of notifications per day. I also would like to use the same notification server later on with the iOS version of the app and for that reason, a custom built notification server is much preferred. p  pI would ideally like to know whats involved in order to write a similar messaging system on the Android frontend. To further clarify, I would like to understand how on top level the GCM notification internally works on Android and how to replicate that functionality on my own.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 65778 pI apologize if this is an ignorant question. It seems it should be trivial, yet I cant find a solution that works.p  pI have a Chart control in a Visual C 2010 form. Im reading a bunch of data out of a form, doing some computation, then plotting the results. Im using AddXY to add the data, and it works fine.p  pHowever, every time I call AddXY, it refreshes the chart. With a large data set, Id prefer that it suspend redraws until all the data is added, then resume redraws. I dont need to watch the line crawl across the screen, and it slows the load down substantially. I would think this would be simple.p  pUsing SuspendLayout on the control or the form didnt seem to affect it. The Chart class does not have a BeginUpdate and EndUpdate like some other controls do. This discussion talks about a workaround for flickerfree use, but that is more than I need.p  pAm I missing something stupid herep  pThanks.p

Negative 65778 pIm building an application with Laravel which communicates with an OpenCPU server to perform some calculations. The OpenCPU server returns data in JSON format, which I then process to pull out the relevant information. This data returns a sku, retailer, date and sales. These are then posted to a controller using AJAX. Within this controller I then want to upload this data into the database by creating a new array of data to upload in one go. Each row should have a sku, retailer, date and sales. The date field in the database is called date, but called obs in the code.p  pOpenCPU returns JSON which is the parsed to a Javascript object usingp  precodevar data  JSON.parseoutput codepre  pAfter logging to the Javascript console I get an array of the correct length, with the sales numbers.p  pThe data is then sent to a Laravel controller via AJAXp  precodesave.clickfunction     var id  filter optionselected.text         var json  .ajax             url sales  id  update,             type POST,             data                       sku sku.text,                     retailer retailer.text,                     obs data.OBS,                     sales data.Sales,                     ,             async false         .responseText     var message  JSON.parsejson     .flash.htmlmessage.fadeIn300.delay2500.fadeOut300  codepre  pIn Laravel I then try to store the data in a MySQL database using the followingp  precodesku  Inputgetsku retailer  Inputgetretailer obs  Inputgetobs sales  Inputgetsales  foreachobs as key gt n      arrayData[]  array         sku gt sku,         retailer gt retailer,         date gt obs[key]         sales gt sales[key]       ChartcreatearrayData codepre  pHowever the above code doesnt appear to work.

Negative 65778 pI am making an Android game. So, people are able to create groupsparties between them and I would like to give them the ability to strongview each member of their group moving on the Google Maps in real timestrong. This means that I have to find a good way to update each clients map markers in real time or pseudoreal time at least.p  pWould an approach with a strongDBMSstrong be fine or that would be too costly In this approach, every client should be responsible to update the DB every so with their current coordinates and thus everyone can make queries to view every other party members lastly updated location. Making this happen within small time intervals will give the feeling to users that people are moving on Map in real time. p  pOn the other hand, would a strongpeertopeerstrong approach handle this case in a better way Like every groupparty runs on its own by letting players exchange info between them containing everyones new coordinates every so interval. I believe that the second approach is better because it does not give load to our server, but there may be drawbacks.

Negative 65778 pI am trying to create a windows form using powershell and then manipulate the data entered. The problem I am having is that I can get the code to work if I copypaste it into a powershell window however I cannot get it to work if I save the exact same code to a PS1 file.

Negative 65778 pI am capturing and rendering photo using AVFoundation, OpenGL Nothing new. I want to provide the user with the highest possible qualityresolution. p  pSo, I am using captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection and feed the SamplerBuffer to the GPU using the AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto capture session preset to get the highest possible resolution. p  pIt works very well on for example an iPhone 5S, I get 3264x2448 pictures and the iPhone 5S max texture buffer size is 4096x4096, so all good. p  pThen I test on iPhone 4 and it doesnt work anymore. Why Because with AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto, I get 2592x1936 images that cannot fit in the maximum 2048x2048 texture buffer of the iPhone 4. Solution would be to downscale the Sampler Buffer before feeding it to the GPU. p  pBrad Larson provides a way to reduce the scale of RGB Sample Buffer, however, I am working using YUV kCVPixelFormatType420YpCbCr8BiPlanarFullRange, and cannot succeed in downscaling the buffer. p  pMy question is how do I efficiently downscale a CMSamplerBuffer that is using YCbCr p  pThank you very muchp  pHere is the code from Brad GPUImage library showing how to downscale a RGB CMSamplerBuffer in case that would help anyone p  precode   void stillImageDataReleaseCallbackvoid releaseRefCon, const void baseAddress      freevoid baseAddress   void GPUImageCreateResizedSampleBufferCVPixelBufferRef cameraFrame, CGSize finalSize, CMSampleBufferRef sampleBuffer       CVPixelBufferCreateWithPlanarBytes for YUV input      CGSize originalSize  CGSizeMakeCVPixelBufferGetWidthcameraFrame, CVPixelBufferGetHeightcameraFrame      CVPixelBufferLockBaseAddresscameraFrame, 0     GLubyte sourceImageBytes   CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddresscameraFrame     CGDataProviderRef dataProvider  CGDataProviderCreateWithDataNULL, sourceImageBytes, CVPixelBufferGetBytesPerRowcameraFrame  originalSize.height, NULL     CGColorSpaceRef genericRGBColorspace  CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB     CGImageRef cgImageFromBytes  CGImageCreateintoriginalSize.width, intoriginalSize.height, 8, 32, CVPixelBufferGetBytesPerRowcameraFrame, genericRGBColorspace, kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little  kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst, dataProvider, NULL, NO, kCGRenderingIntentDefault      GLubyte imageData  GLubyte  calloc1, intfinalSize.width  intfinalSize.height  4      CGContextRef imageContext  CGBitmapContextCreateimageData, intfinalSize.width, intfinalSize.height, 8, intfinalSize.width  4, genericRGBColorspace,  kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little  kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst     CGContextDrawImageimageContext, CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, finalSize.width, finalSize.height, cgImageFromBytes     CGImageReleasecgImageFromBytes     CGContextReleaseimageContext     CGColorSpaceReleasegenericRGBColorspace     CGDataProviderReleasedataProvider      CVPixelBufferRef pixelbuffer  NULL     CVPixelBufferCreateWithByteskCFAllocatorDefault, finalSize.width, finalSize.height, kCVPixelFormatType32BGRA, imageData, finalSize.width  4, stillImageDataReleaseCallback, NULL, NULL, amppixelbuffer     CMVideoFormatDescriptionRef videoInfo  NULL     CMVideoFormatDescriptionCreateForImageBufferNULL, pixelbuffer, ampvideoInfo      CMTime frameTime  CMTimeMake1, 30     CMSampleTimingInfo timing  frameTime, frameTime, kCMTimeInvalid      CMSampleBufferCreateForImageBufferkCFAllocatorDefault, pixelbuffer, YES, NULL, NULL, videoInfo, amptiming, sampleBuffer     CFReleasevideoInfo     CVPixelBufferReleasepixelbuffer  codepre

Negative 65778 pMy bank has a really simple login system. Using casperjs I have been able to pull my latest account balance and my last transaction. There are many ways to scrape data off the Internet, I just used Casperjs to test out its capabilities.I checked with the bank and they say as long as its my bank account, its no problem.p  pHeres the technical problem Im having to deal with the bank limits the number of login to  40 a day. Should the number of logins go above that. It will lock me out of my account for 6 hours. Also, the system logs me out every 20 minutes irrelevant of the actionp  pWhat Im trying to do figure out is is there a way to only run a scraping function if a transaction has occurred and there is a change in the account balancep  pScraping is normally done on a timely basis for simplicity. What can I implement that is a push notification style scraping mechanism p  pThe objective is to get a messageemail Everytime a transaction has occurred with a Max 34 minute delay while not getting locked out of the system.p  pAny creative answers would do too.p

Negative 65778 pI have a problem regarding the Session Timeout handling in Spring Security in our spring application. Actually the application is configure for 1 hour session timeout in SiteMinder. So after 1 hour, the application session is timed out. After session time out if we do any operation on the page, instead of redirecting the user to invalidsession.jsp, as its configured in our securitycontext.xml file. Currently when we click on the submit button a search button, an ajax call is made and its giving a wrong message saying records are not found, which is confusing for the user. How to handle this issue in such a way that after session time out, instead of ajax call, the application should redirect to invalidsession.jspp  pp

Negative 65778 pI have an ASP.NET Web Forms application .NET Framework 3.5 that allows users to download files. These users have to register in the application before being able to do any operation and are not linked with any Windows account. The application has a HTTP handler that triggers each time a user wants to download a file. That handler checks if the user has the permissions to do that operation and pushes the file.p  pWhen a user clicks on an Office document doc, xls, ppt, etc., the file is automatically downloaded provided the user has the right permissions and opened with the adequate program Word, Excel or PowerPoint. Now, what I would like to do is allowing this user to edit that document and directly save it on the server from the external program without this user to upload it again via the web interface.

Negative 65778 pI am trying to create some APIs using lucene facets APIs. First I will explain my requirement with an example. Lets say I am keeping track of the count of  people who enter through a certain door. Lets say the time range I am interested in Last 6 hours to get the total count, I know that I ll have to use Ranged Facets. How do I sample this time range and get the counts of each bucket In other words, as an example, If I split the last  6 hours into 5 minutes buckets, I get 72 6605  different time ranges. I would be interested in getting hit counts for each of these 72 ranges in an array with the respective lower bound of each sample. Can someone point me the direction I should follow the classes which can be helpful looking at ElasticSearch already has this feature exposed by their Javascript API.p

If I click on the tab, it comes to the foreground and the SelectionChanged method fires, repeating the same console message while I stare at the same item contentp  precodemyTabControl now has SelectedIndex of 0 myTabControl now has SelectedIndex of 0 codepre  pHow can I both programmatically show the content of my new tab, and see that tab as the foreground tab  p  pThe only way I can bring ANY tab to the foreground programmatically is by setting codemyTabControl.SelectedIndex  1code.

Negative 65778 pI am trying to create two columns of equal width, the left one containing text and the right one containing an image. I would like the image to resize down to the width of the column if the image width is greater than the column width, but would like the image to keep its original size if the image is less than the column width. I have tried the instructions in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4684304howcaniresizeanimagedynamicallywithcssasthebrowserwidthheightchangthis questiona, but the image, if larger, will consume whatever space it needs, squishing the column on the left containing text. I am wondering if this has to do with how tablecell divs behave, or if it is a precedence issue where the browser will accommodate an image before text.

The problem is I would like the two columns middlecentered, and I cannot get the smaller float div to size to full height in the parent container, so the inner contents are topaligned.

An actionbar button allows editting it, calling again the same class, NewToDo.  While editting I can cancel the notifications associated with the todo, and  my code makes that like this in the NewToDo classp  precode  AlarmManager alarmManager  AlarmManager getSystemServiceALARMSERVICE   Intent i  new Intentthis, AlarmReceiver.class creating a matching Intent    Log.vgetStringR.string.appname, id   id  the 3 aforementioned    PendingIntent displayIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitygetBaseContext, id, i, alarmIntent.FILLINDATA   alarmManager.canceldisplayIntent codepre  pBut the notifications keeps appearing each 30 seconds, so theyre not cancelled.    p  pI saw the following suggestion in another postp  blockquote   pIntent intentYouWantToCancel  new Intentthis, AlarmReceive.class   intentYouWantToCancel.setActionaRelevantStringp      pwhen you set the alarmmanager as well as when you want to delete it.  p blockquote  pSo I put in both intents as aRelevantString a cast to String of the unique identifier.

Negative 65778 pWhen using Boost with Visual C, you can simply include the headers without ever bothering specifying which input libs to link. At build time, the IDE will somehow figure out the appropriate libs to link, be it release or debug, statically linking to CRT or dynamically linking to CRT. This makes using Boost quite convenient. Im wondering how this is achieved. As an example, with a Multithreaded Debug DLL MDd configuration, the lib codelibboostsystemvc80mtgd153.libcode will be chosen and linked to automatically.p

Negative 65778 pThe basic issue I am facing is When I try to redirect one of two connected calls each is a twilio generated call to a conference, the call moves to the conference but ends within 2 secondsp  pHere are the steps, 1. Customer calls and is put in queue 2. A REST API twilio call is created to agent phone 3. When agent picks up the call then we are queueing into the queue where customer call is present from first step and connects the agent with the queued call throught  twiml 4. Then through REST api I am trying to put the callsid for customer call to a conference. On doing this the caller is put in conference but after 2 seconds the customer calls ends.p

Negative 65778 pI was studying codequeuebasedcode approach for codeBellmanFord algorithmcodefor single source shortest path from codeRobert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne  Algorithms, 4th editioncode  source code for algorithm from book is present at this link a hrefhttpalgs4.cs.princeton.edu44spBellmanFordSP.java relnofollowhttpalgs4.cs.princeton.edu44spBellmanFordSP.javaa.p  pI have two points one is a doubt and other is code improvement suggestion.p  ol lipIn above approach following is code for relax method for relaxing distance to vertices.p  precodefor DirectedEdge e  G.adjv      int w  e.to     if distTo[w] gt distTo[v]  e.weight          distTo[w]  distTo[v]  e.weight         edgeTo[w]  e         if onQueue[w]              queue.enqueuew             onQueue[w]  true                   if cost  G.V  0         findNegativeCycle       codepreli ol  pIn this method below condition is used before finding negative cycle.p  precodeif cost  G.V  0      findNegativeCycle  codepre  pAbove they are dividing cost by number of codeverticescode in graph to check for codenegative cyclecode. It may be because  relaxation is done codeV1code times and if relaxation run for codeVthcode time it means it has cycle, where V is number of vertices.p  pBut I think in queuebased approach they are using divisor to check at regular interval if cycle has occurred or not. A cycle can occur  before or just after above condition is true. If cycle occurred after above condition is true then algorithm has to wait till next time condition is  true to detect cycle, it is not necessary that cycle will occur exactly when if codecost  G.V  0code is true. So I think divisor can be any number small enough so that we can check for cycle after appropriate time interval. Am I right in thinking thatp  ol start2 lipThe code improvment suggestion in above program for BellmanFord algorithm I have is from codefindNegativeCyclecode method we can return true  if cycle has occured and then this conditonp  pcodeif cost  G.V  0     findNegativeCycle codepli ol  pCan be changed top  precodeif cost  G.V  0     iffindNegativeCycle         return      codepre  pIn code for loop keeps on running even if codefindNegativeCyclecode method has found a cycle. So we can return if cycle has occurred instead of processing rest of for loop.p  pPlease share your thoughts for above 2 points. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 65778 pMany predicates define some kind of an acyclic path built from edges defined via a binary relation, quite similarly to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq26946133772868defining transitive closurea. A generic definition is thus called for.p  pNote that the notions defined in graph theory do not readily match what is commonly expected.

In some cases the request is fireandforget command and the result is pretty meaningless, so it makes little sense for the caller to actually subscribe to the returned IObservable.p  pThe functionality I need isp  ol liThe command is sent immediately, even if the caller never subscribes to the IObservableli liIf and when the client subscribes, they will get the result even if they are late subscribingli liThe command is only ever sent once, but all subscriptions should get the same results.li ol  pI tried doing this using .Replay.RefCount and doing a Subscribe internally before returning the IObservable. This almost works, but in the case where the client subscribes emafterem the result received and thus after the autodisposing of the sequence on completion it causes the subscription code to be called again, sending the command for a second time.p  pIs there a simple Rx extension that can handle this scenario for me, or do I need to roll my ownp

Ive started looking for solution to my problem and found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17303759504325thisa answer.

Negative 65778 pI am trying to implement a reservoir sampling algorithm using java. I have N streams of data  readings from sensors arriving at a sink node  of unknown size. For the sake of simplicity lets assume i have one stream of unknown size. p  pSo what one of the reservoir sampling algorithms suggests is to create a reservoir of size reservoirSize. Lets say it is 5. The first five readings you get, store  them in your reservoir. Ok. Now as you get more and more readings, for each reading generate a random number from 0 to reading number and if that random number is smaller than the reservoirSize then store the reading in the reservoir[randomNumber].p  pSo lets say i have reservoirSize  5 and i just got my 10th reading. I will generate a random number from 0 to 10 and if that number is smaller than 5 i wll store the reading there where the random number points. Lets say random number is 3 so i store reading number 10 in reservoir[3].   p  precodepublic void sample Vector pool, double Measurement, int streamIndex       if streamIndex lt ReservoirSize         pool.addElementDouble.toStringMeasurement          else if randomIndexintranNum.nextIntstreamIndex1ltReservoirSize          pool.setElementAtDouble.toStringMeasurement, randomIndex             codepre  pThe problem with this code is that once the streamIndex gets big enough  above 4.000 for example  i rarely sample any readings. And it does make sense because the propability of generating a random number from 0 to 4000 that is smaller than 5 is significanly smaller than the propability to generate a random number from 0 to lets say 100, that is smaller than 5. p  pI also implemented AlgorthmR from Vitters paper and another way described herebr a hrefhttpgregable.com200710reservoirsampling.html relnofollowGregable ReservoirSamplingap  pbut all implementations have the same problem. The larger the stream gets the smaller the sampling frequency becomes. So for a sampling rate of 0.5s, one hour after i start sampling which means that about 7000 readings have been forwarded to the sink node , a change in the measured quantity will not be detected for another good half an hour i.e the reading indicating the change will be discarded from the reservoir.p  pstrongAlgorthmR implemantationstrongp  precode    public RSAlgorithmR          this.currentPool  null         this.randomStoreatIndex  0         this.randomIndex  0         this.ranNum  new Random           public void sample LLNode cNode, double Measurement       int streamIndex  cNode.getStreamIndex     int storeatIndex cNode.getStoreatIndex       if streamIndex lt ReservoirSize          cNode.data.addElementDouble.toStringMeasurement          if streamIndex   ReservoirSize  1               randomStoreatIndex  intranNum.nextIntReservoirSize             cNode.setStoreatIndexintrandomStoreatIndex                                   else          if storeatIndex  streamIndex              randomIndexintranNum.nextIntReservoirSize             cNode.data.setElementAtDouble.toStringMeasurement, randomIndex               randomStoreatIndex  intranNum.nextIntstreamIndex  ReservoirSize  ReservoirSize             cNode.setStoreatIndexrandomStoreatIndex              System.out.printlnIndex streamIndex             System.out.printlnrandomIndex   randomIndex                                    cNode.setStreamIndex     codepre  pstrongGregable Implementationstrongp  precode    public ReservoirSampler           this.currentPool  null         this.randomIndex  0         this.ranProp  new Random         this.ranInd  new Random           public void sample LLNode currentSpot, double humidityRead,          double temperatureRead, int streamIndex       double acceptancePropability  doubleReservoirSizestreamIndex      if streamIndex lt ReservoirSize         currentSpot.humidityData.addElementDouble.toStringhumidityRead         currentSpot.temperatureData.addElementDouble.toStringtemperatureRead          else           ranProp.setSeedSystem.currentTimeMillis         randomPropabilitydoubleranProp.nextDouble           if  randomPropability lt acceptancePropability             ranInd.setSeedSystem.currentTimeMillis             randomIndexintranInd.nextIntReservoirSize             currentSpot.humidityData.setElementAtDouble.toStringhumidityRead,randomIndex             currentSpot.temperatureData.setElementAtDouble.toStringtemperatureRead,randomIndex                                    codepre  pIs that the normal behaviour of the algorthm or am i missing something here And if that is the normal behaviour is there a way to make it work more accuratellyp

Negative 65778 pFor some reason when I connect my Windows laptop to the personal hot spot on my rooted Nexus 5 phone, a new wireless connection entry is created in Windows for the connection.

Negative 65778 pLets say I have a Docker container that holds some data. I want this data to persist  if the container is stopped, removed, upgraded etc. I still want the data to be in an accessible location on the host OS filesystem.p  pCurrently, my solution is to create a directory codesrvservicenamecode on my host I use Ubuntu 14.10 and then run my service with the codev srvservicenamepathinsidecontainercode argument.p  pBy trial and error I found out that sometimes the container is unable to write to this, because it doesnt have the right permissions. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq235442821042555this questiona where dataonly containers are given as a solution. Well, I dont want to use containers because it seems needlessly complicated for what I am doing. Id rather just keep mounting the directories with codevcode.p  pSo, how can I set the right permissions on the directory I am mountingp
Negative 65778 pI am looking for a way to display some meshes with color mapping in Chrome browser, so I have tried codex3domcode and codeindexedFaceSetcode. I assume there is a way to assign colors to vertices so that the color of the face is interpolated or at least I should be able to assign different constant color to each face.

My device is located under Portable Devices and when I right click and select update drivers and then specify where the google driver is, Windows tells me that it has identified that Media device MTP is the best and only driver available. It doesnt say anything about the ADB. p  pI even tried uninstalling the Google Driver and then trying to update the driver in Device Manager, but it still doesnt work.

Negative 65778 pFor my code, it is a number guessing game. They get 10 guesses before they lose, and it tells them if it is too low, too high etc. In my output when Im telling them if they are too high or too low, I also wanted to display how many guesses they have left. But currently it tells them they have 9 guesses left every time and Im not sure why. p  pThe rest of the program works. So after 10 guesses it will tell them they lost, just every guess up until then it says they have 9 guesses left.p  precodenamespace NumberGuessingGame  public class GuessingGame       int myGuess  0     int guessesLeft  10     int gamesPlayed  0     int gamesWon  0     int gamesLost  0      Random rand     int number  0      public GuessingGame              rand  new Random         number  rand.Next1, 100          public void ResetGame              number  rand.Next1, 100         guessesLeft  10           public int CheckGuessint newGuess              myGuess  newGuess          if guessesLeft lt 1                                      gamesLost             gamesPlayed             ResetGame             return 2                  else if myGuess gt number                                      guessesLeft             return 1                  else if myGuess lt number                                     guessesLeft             return 1                  else                                      gamesPlayed             gamesWon             ResetGame             return 0                codepre  pp  pCode for form classp  precodenamespace NumberGuessingGame  public partial class frmMain  Form      public frmMain              InitializeComponent                              GuessingGame myGuess  new GuessingGame      private void btnCheckClickobject sender, EventArgs e              int inputGuess  Convert.ToInt32txtGuess.Text         int result  myGuess.CheckGuessinputGuess          int guessesLeft  10           ifresult  2                       MessageBox.ShowYou ran out of guesses and lost                  else ifresult  1                      guessesLeft             MessageBox.ShowYour guess was too high, try again  n You have   guessesLeft   guesses left                  else ifresult  1                      guessesLeft             MessageBox.ShowYour guess was too low, try again  n You have   guessesLeft   guesses left                  else ifresult  0                      MessageBox.ShowYou won                 codepre  pp
Negative 65778 pI am using the softfloat library a hrefhttpwww.jhauser.usarithmeticSoftFloat.html relnofollowhttpwww.jhauser.usarithmeticSoftFloat.htmla to implement a single precision sqrt algorithm. I am trying to understand the reciprocal sqrt approximation function implemented as part of the softfloat library. Please see below the code. Could anyone explain how they came up with the LUT It looks like a combination of LUT and NR approximations, but a detailed explanation would definitely helpp  precode         Returns an approximation to the reciprocal of the square root of       the number represented by a, where a is interpreted as an         unsigned fixedpoint number either with one integer bit and 31       fraction bits or with two integer bits and 30 fraction bits.  The      format of a is determined by oddExpA, which must be either 0 or      1.  If oddExpA is 1, a is interpreted as having one integer bit,      and if oddExpA is 0, a is interpreted as having two integer      bits.  The a input must be normalized, meaning that its      mostsignificant bit bit 31 must be 1.  Thus, if A is the value of      the fixedpoint interpretation of a, it follows that 1 lt A lt 2      when oddExpA is 1, and 2 lt A lt 4 when oddExpA is 0.      The returned value is interpreted as a pure unsigned fraction, having     no integer bits and 32 fraction bits.  The approximation returned is      never greater than the true reciprocal 1sqrtA, and it differs      from the true reciprocal by at most 2.06 ulp units in the last      place.  The approximation returned is also always within the range      0.5 to 1 thus, the mostsignificant bit of the result is always set.            uint32t softfloatapproxRecipSqrt321 unsigned int oddExpA,   uint32t a               int index         uint16t eps         static const uint16t k0s[]             0xB4C9, 0xFFAB, 0xAA7D, 0xF11C, 0xA1C5, 0xE4C7, 0x9A43, 0xDA29,           0x93B5, 0xD0E5, 0x8DED, 0xC8B7, 0x88C6, 0xC16D, 0x8424, 0xBAE1                  static const uint16t k1s[]             0xA5A5, 0xEA42, 0x8C21, 0xC62D, 0x788F, 0xAA7F, 0x6928, 0x94B6,           0x5CC7, 0x8335, 0x52A6, 0x74E2, 0x4A3E, 0x68FE, 0x432B, 0x5EFD                  uint16t r0         uintfast32t ESqrR0         uint32t delta0         uintfast32t r         uint32t sqrDelta0          index  agtgt27 amp 0xE  oddExpA         eps  uint16t agtgt12         r0  k0s[index]  k1s[index]  uintfast32t epsgtgt20         ESqrR0  uintfast32t r0  r0         if   oddExpA  ESqrR0 ltlt 1         delta0  uintfast32t uint32t ESqrR0  uintfast64t  agtgt23         r  uintfast32t r0ltlt16  r0  uintfast64t delta0gtgt25         sqrDelta0  uintfast64t delta0  delta0gtgt32         r  uint32t rgtgt1  rgtgt3  uintfast32t r0ltlt14            uintfast64t sqrDelta0          gtgt48         if   r amp 0x80000000  r  0x80000000         return r         codepre

Negative 65778 pI am working on an application that utilizes Spider Monkey to run our JS.  I only have a single object type JSNode that acts as an interface to a complex DOM consisting of various objects with properties and methods.  Everything is created and registered on the fly.  I am running into a problem where I have an object with a function that needs to be associated dynamically.  The problem is when I run the script from the context of the associated object, the NewResolve which I usually use to recognize and define the properties, as far as I can tell cannot know its a function definition to allow me to define the function on the fly.  I dont get the sense that JSCompileScript will correctly build the function and associate it with the HandleObject.  And of course I cant utilize JSCompileFunction without doing all of the script parsing myself, which to me feels like the point of utilizing spider monkey in the first place, but maybe I am wrong.p  pAny ideas or guidance on this issue   p

Negative 65778 pIm using select2 with multiple options and programmatic access to select also with a button. It works fine but when I click on the button all previously selected values are removed and only the value from the clicked button gets selected. Since Im using multiple select it would make sense to add the clicked value and leave the previously selected without removing them... Is there another event to trigger besides change that does not remove values but adds them insteadp  precodeltselect ididentities classjsexampleprogrammatic stylewidth100 multiplemultiplegt ltselectgt  lttdgtltbutton idprefixteu.entityid classjsprogrammaticsetval valueteu.entityid nameteu.entitygtlti classfa faplusgtltigtltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtteu.entitylttdgt lttdgtteu.userlttdgt  ltscript gt .jsexampleprogrammatic.select2     minimumInputLength 2,     placeholder Select entities...,     allowClear true,     multipletrue,     delay 250,     tagsfalse,     ajax          url entitiessearchautocomplete,         dataType json,         data function parms, page  return  title parms.term  ,     ,  ltscriptgt ltscriptgt var example  identities button[idprefix].clickfunction    value  this.attrvalue    valuename  this.attrname  if identities option[valuevalue].length gt 0       else        identities.appendltoption valuevaluegtvaluenameltoptiongt    example.valvalue.triggerchange    ltscriptgt codepre
