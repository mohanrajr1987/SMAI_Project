Negative 5282 pIve been investigating what data layer to use for a new webbased project Im designing and Im very keen to look at incorporating LINQ to SQL. Its apparent simplicity, flexibility and designer support really appeals and the implicit tiein to SQL Server is fine.p  pHowever, it has been announced recently that LINQ to SQL will be taking a back seat to the Entity Framework now that its been passed to the ADO.NET team a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comadonetarchive20081029updateonlinqtosqlandlinqtoentitiesroadmap.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.comadonetarchive20081029updateonlinqtosqlandlinqtoentitiesroadmap.aspxa. Sure, it will be supported in the future, but its unlikely that it will see much more development work.p  pWith this in mind, would you recommend me using this technology for my project or is it worth either selecting an alternative ORM nHibernate or manually coding up a generic DALp  pThe project itself is ASP.NET and SQL Server 20052008 based and will possibly use MVC, even though its still in beta. Its a personal project, the database wont be overly complex and it will mainly be used as a prototype to look at .NET future tech. I would be basing future projects on what I learn from this one though, so the choices I make will affect larger solutions to come.p  pAnd yes, I realise that Microsoft will probably bring out a whole new data access technology tomorrow anyway p

Negative 5282 pI was wondering if any of you had successfully implemented DDD in a ClientServer app and would like to share some experiences.p  pWe are currently working on a smart client in Flex and a backend in Java. On the server we have a service layer exposed to the client that offers CRUD operations amongst some other service methods. I understand that in DDD these services should be repositories and services should be used to handle use cases that do not fit inside a repository. Right now, we mimic these services on the client behind an interface and inject implementations Webservices, RMI, etc via an IoC container.p  pSo some questions arisep  ul lishould the server expose repositories to the client or do we need to have some sort of a facade that is able to handle security for instanceli lishould the client implement repositories and DDD in general knowing that in the client, most of the logic is view related and real business logic lives on the server. All communication with the server happens asynchronously and we have a single threaded programming model on the client.li lihow about mapping client to server objects and vice versa We tried DTOs but reverted back to exposing the state of our objects and mapping directly to them. I know this is considered bad practice, but it saves us an incredible amount of timeli ul  pIn general I think a new generation of applications is coming with the growth of Flex, Silverlight, JavaFX and Im curious how DDD fits into this.p

Negative 5282 pI have been trying to get this code to work for a while now and cannot figure out what is wrong. It is for a tri state rollover with images.

In itself, this is not sufficient for a successful migration, though. Among other things, the current MS AJAX beta does not support the extender wizard in the ASP.NET designer. Also, I havent found a way to compile successfully with control extenders added in previous releases of ASP.NET AJAX. It looks like AJAX migration will be a tough area for ASP.NET apps in VS 2010.p  pAround VS 2010 release time, I hope to see a community wiki for migration tips and techniques.p

Negative 5282 pI need a Facebook application that kind of sit in the background of user operations. Once the app is installed by the user, it will keep on sending the users status updates, new friend connections etc to another web app of mine. It will keep on getting info no matter whether the app page is open or not.p  pMy question is  is this possible So far, Ive played around a simple iFrame app written with the Java API. It seems that it can only perform data collections whenever the page is hit. p  pEDIT Privacy is definitely a valid concern here. But the application will definitely prompt for permission even if FB API is not built in to do so. p
Negative 5282 pIs it possible to set cookies on response when the return render type is set as jsonp  pI can set cookies on the response object when returning with a standard render type and later on, Im able to get it back on the subsequent request.

Negative 5282 pThe standard method to send data on a stream socket has always been to call send with a chunk of data to write, check the return value to see if all data was sent and then keep calling send again until the whole message has been accepted.p  pFor example this is a simple example of a common schemep  pre int sendallint sock, unsigned char buffer, int len    int nsent    whilelen  0      nsent  sendsock, buffer, len, 0     ifnsent  1  error       return 1      buffer  nsent     len  nsent      return 0  ok, all data sent   pre  pEven the BSD manpage mentions that p  pem...If no messages space is available at the socket to hold the message to be transmitted, then send strongnormally blocksstrong...emp  pWhich indicates that we should assume that send may return without sending all data. Now I find this rather broken but even W. Richard Stevens assumes this in his standard reference book about a hrefhttpwww.kohala.comstartunpv12e.htmlnetwork programminga, not in the beginning chapters, but the more advanced examples uses his own writen write all data function instead of calling write.p  pNow I consider this still to be more or less broken, since if send is not able to transmit all data or accept the data in the underlying buffer and the socket is blocking, then send should block and return when the whole send request has been accepted.p  pI mean, in the code example above, what will happen if send returns with less data sent is that it will be called right again with a new request. What has changed since last call At max a few hundred CPU cycles have passed so the buffer is still full. If send now accepts the data why couldnt it accept it beforep  pOtherwise we will end upp with an inefficient loop where we are trying to send data on a socket that cannot accept data and keep trying, or elsep  pSo it seems like the workaround, if needed, results in heavily inefficient code and in those circumstances blocking sockets should be avoided at all an non blocking sockets together with select should be used instead.p
Negative 5282 pstrongBackgroundstrong I want to create a custom VB compiler, extending the original compiler, to handle my custom compiletime attributes.p  pstrongQuestionstrong after Ive created my custom compiler and Ive got an executable file capable of compiling VB code via the standard commandline interface, how do I integrate this compiler with the Visual Studio IDE such that pressing compile or build will make use of my compiler instead of the default compiler.p  pstrongEDITstrong Correct me if im wrongp  pFrom the reactions here, I see this question is a bit shocking, so I shall further explain my needs and background .NET provides us with a great mechanism called Attributes. As far as I understand, making attributes apply their intended behavior upon the attributed element assembly, module, class, method, etc.  attributes must be reflected upon. So the real trick here is reflecting and applying behavior at the right spot. p  pLets take Serialization for example We decorate a class with the Serializable attribute. We then pass an instance of the class to the formatters Serialize method. The formatter reflects upon the instance, checking if it has the Serializable attribute, and acting accordingly.p  pNow, if we examine the Synchronization, Flags, Obsolete and CLSCompliant attributes, then the real question is who reflects upon them At least in some cases, it has to be the compiler andor IDE. Therefore, it seems that if I wish to create custom attributes that change an elements behavior regardless of any specific consumer, i must extend the compiler to reflect upon them at compilation. p  pOf course, these are not my personal insights the book a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1590591364Applied .NET Attributesa provides a complete example of creating a custom attribute and a custom C compiler to reflect upon that attribute at compilation the example is used to implement javastyle checked exceptions. p

Negative 5282 pIm trying to make sense of a situation I have using entity framework on .net 3.5 sp1  MySQL 6.1.2.0 as the provider.

Its varies widely, from  15th to half.p  pThere isnt any control flow code inside the foreach i.e. no break, continue, trycatch, conditions around total, anything that could affect the count. As confirmation, there are other totals captured inside the loop related to the actions, and those match the lower and higher total runs.p  pI dont find any reason to the above, other than something in entity framework or the mysql provider that causes it to end the foreach when retrieving an item. p  pThe body of the foreach can have some good variation in time, as the actions involve file amp network access, strongmy best shot at the time is that when the .net code takes beyond certain threshold there is some type of timeout in the underlying frameworkprovider and instead of causing an exception it is silently reporting no more items for enumerationstrong.p  pCan anyone give some light in the above scenario andor confirm if the entity frameworkmysql provider has the above behaviorp  hr  pstrongUpdate 1strong I cant reproduce the behavior by using Thread.Sleep in a simple foreach in a test project, not sure where else to look for this weird behavior .p  hr  pstrongUpdate 2strong in the example above the .Count always returns the same  correct amount of items.

Would really prefer not having to change the code in all the projects that use entity framework  mysql to do .ToArray before enumerating the results because I dont know when itll swallow some results.

Negative 5282 pI am writing some software in Ruby on Rails to do some simple user management for login to our server.  I am working on a method for the User controller that will allow a user to change their password on the server FTP  website login password.  I would like the administration of the server passwords to be done through the website, and to that end I have come up with the following algorithm. p  precode User logs into website, and indicates a change of password is desired using   current login password, and enters new password with confirmation  Rails user.rb model file has algorithm which establishes readwrite with a    program tty via PTY.spawn and expect.  This happens as user wwwdata.  First command issued to the PTY is su ltusernamegt, enter current system password.   Next, send passwd, wait for password prompt and pass current password.  Wait for new password and send desired password.  again for confirmation of password.  As long as none of the expect statements fail including password updated   successfully, salt and hash the password and store it in the database as normal. codepre  pI am reasonably confident that this is a secure method of maintaining sync with the system account passwords. But then again....Im not a hacker or a security expert.  This isnt a publicly open system, but there are a variety of users that will be accessing the system.p  pFirst question Is there a smarter way of doing this Via PAM maybe I have used linux personally for years but my administration experience is limited.  The server is running either Debian or Ubuntu Server, nginx and a few rails instances.p  pSecond question How do I work in a reset password function into the system  This obviously requires root access and would look more likep  precode Verify user by other means email, administrator, whatev  su root or sudo s uhhhmmm....  passwd ltusernamegt  set to generated value  force user to change password  next login codepre  pFirst glance, this seems less secure.  Root access and such. But I cant figure out a way around it that doesnt involve some admin personally codesudo passwd ltusernamegtcode each time the user forgets their password....moreover, I dont want my rails app to have root access to the system....it runs as a different user for a reason.  So I guess that means I have to setup a root cron that runs a rake task to look for passwords that need to be reset....p  pIm also doing other things in my user model, like disk space monitoringp  precodedef updatediskusage   homedir  Aw[.09].Z   runs as wwwdata   homedirsize  usrbindu cs home1  grep total  awk print 1   self.quota  homedirsize.toi   self.quotachecked  Time.now   self.quota end codepre

Currently Im using ActiveX scripting to work with the database in a HTML Application .HTA file works only with Internet Explorer, I would really like to make this more cross browser  in the event the company EVER switches to an actual browser  by using JAVA to access the database, then output the results in JSON to a local variable JavaScript can call and make use of.p  pHonestly would rather tutorial type information as I want to actually learn why this works so I can later modify it to suit my needs. I have Eclipse installed as well as JDK, and can right small programs in Java, so not completely brain dead  but not far from P . Ive been working with JavaScript so I can read quite a bit of Java code as it stands  not the same syntax since they are not related, but the little I do know of Java I can translate back to JS without problem .p  pAnyway, any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I can continue developing with ActiveX  as I know that works on the system and Im 99 sure they will continue using Internet Explorer, but, would like some flexibility .p

Negative 5282 pI am attempting to dynamically generate cubemaps in OpenGL using a multipass rendering system. The method I am using successfully renders the scene to a frame buffer object tested with glReadPixels. The frame buffer is attached to a texture, the target of which is GLTEXTURECUBEMAPARB. I have verified that the frame buffer contents strongdostrong end up in the texture by querying the bound texture with glGetTexImage and writing the contents to disk.p  pHowever, when I bind the cube map in order to render it onto an object, the texture is not visible on the mesh.p  pThe process is as followsp  p1 Unbind all textures from GLTEXTURECUBEMAPARBp  p2 Bind the frame buffer object.p  p3 Attach the texture to target GLCOLORATTACHMENT0EXT of the frame buffer.  I start with the positivex side of the cube GLTEXTURECUBEMAPPOSITIVEXARB.  The others follow in subsequent passes.p  p4 Attach a depth render buffer to target GLDEPTHATTACHMENTEXT of the frame buffer.p  p5 Direct rendering to GLCOLORATTACHMENT0EXT with glDrawBuffer.p  p6 Render the scene along the appropriate axis.p  p7 With the frame buffer still bound, detach the texture with glFramebufferTexture2DEXT.p  p8 Unbind the frame buffer and redirect rendering to GLBACK with glDrawBuffer.p  p9 Repeat steps 18 for all sides of the cube map.p  p10 Bind the final cube map texture and render the final scene.  A GLSL shader is used to calculate texture coordinates.p  pThis technique is based on notes available a hrefhttpwww.csee.wvu.edutmcgrawcs570spring2010lecture62010.pdf relnofollowherea.p  pDebugging steps taken thusfarp  pI Loaded a static cube map from disk to test the shader.  It works as expected.p  pII Queried the contents of the frame buffer using glReadPixels during the first 6 passes. The scene appeared as it should.p  pIII Copied the contents of the cube map using glGetTexImage after rendering completed. Wrote the contents to disk as an image file. The various sides of the cube appeared as they should.p  pI can only conclude that the frame buffertexture are being renderedto correctly.  For whatever reason, I cannot get the resulting texture to appear on the final mesh. The texture is definitely bound prior to the final rendering pass and GLTEXTURECUBEMAPARB is enabled.p  pAs noted in the procedure outlined above, the texture is unbound prior to frame buffer rendering so as to avoid readwrite conflicts.  Similarly, the texture is detached from the frame buffer after each and every pass for the same reason.p  pAt first I was concerned that my reuse of GLCOLORATTACHMENT0EXT triggered the problem. This now seems unlikely given step III of my debugging process.  Moreover, I have found references on internet forums to people doing the same without issue.p  pThis is taking place on an NVIDIA 9400M Mac OS X.  OpenGL Extension Viewer reports that I have all the necessary extensions to perform this operation.p  pAny insight into what might be causing this is appreciated.p

Is it to create a DTO which is exactly the same as the EditModel ActionModel , just for the purposes of passing it from MVC  BLL  DAL Are there any better waysp

Negative 5282 pGiven how expressive Ruby is, Im wondering if anyone has ever tried to create a class or module that will mimick JS object syntax.  For instance, in JS I can of course do thisp  precode[1]  var obj  a b [2]  obj.c  d [3]  obj.a  123 [4]  obj[e]  f [5]  obj.e  obj[a] codepre  pIn Ruby I can, as of now, have code that will permit me to do something like thisp  precode[1]  obj  a gt b.tojs [2]   obj.c  d ltlt This is what I cant solve, c is first defined here. [3]  obj.a  123 [4]  obj[e]  f [5]  obj.e  obj[a] codepre  pAs long as I get a symbol through square brackets or on initialization, I can easily store the KV pair and create codeinstance methodscode for the setters and getters.p  pHowever, I havent been able to figure out how to create an object that will respond to c if its not defined, then do some magic.  For instance, p  ul liI can iterate over the hash coming in, and set up accessorsli liI can use code[]k, vcode for the bracket notation and do the same thing.li ul  h3My progress in the second style up to this point.h3  pTheres a very specific codeObjectrespondtomissingcode which can take a specific symbol in it but cant respond in the general case.p  pTheres three possible ways that I can think of solving the commented out, second invocation stylep  ul liMake the object not an instance of a class but a Method at all times. For instance, the following worksli ul  pre class A   def b puts c end end def always   A.new end  c  always c.b pre  pGiven this, there may be a possible way to do some kind of error catching and then hook the object accordingly.p  ul lipUtilize some fantastic ruby feature that I havent heard of.  Ruby is such a rich language, this may already be quite easy. pli lipOverride the error handling mechanics somehow.  I dont have any idea how someone would do this in the large general case, but basically youd be telling ruby that if any instance of some class failed to respond to a method, youd have some generalized handler to deal with things.pli ul  pAnyway, if anyone has any idea here, it would be a pretty fun exercise I think.

Negative 5282 pI have written a program that has a class with a constructor and destructor written with couts and cins.p  pThe class contains a run function which I am using as my menu. From the menu, I want to have the user select the option to 1. Test the constructor creates an instance from the class and 2. Test the destructor exits the menu and destructs at the end of main.p  pHere is my dilemma.p  pIn main in order for me to use the run function, I have to create and instance of the class. However, I am using templates. ie. codeClassltclassTypegt classTypeRuncode.p  pIn order for me to create an instance to be able to use run I have to specify a classType, and this will call the constructor, which I do not want. I only want the constructor to run when the user selects it from the menu.p  pWhat is the most efficient way to go about thisbr Should I create an inheritaned class just for the run functionp
Negative 5282 pI have a drawing function in my iOS 5 app that draws a map of textured hexagons. Im trying to implement color picking to make the hexagon selection easier, so I built another drawing function that draws the hexagons in various solid colors. Each of these runs fine as long as I never call the alternate function.p  pThe problem happens when I try and draw the solid color map at any point after Ive drawn the textured hexagon map  even in different render loops. I am usingp  precodeglDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY glEnableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY codepre  pwhen drawing the solid color map, and p  precodeglEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY glDisableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY codepre  pwhen drawing the textured map. p  pBut it seems like the texture state is staying active and preventing the solid colors from drawing correctly. As far as I can tell, its trying to draw the solid colors as textures, even though Ive disabled that state. Without any bound texture, they show up blank.p  pIs there some other function I need to call to successfully switch between color and texture modes p

Negative 5282 pIm pretty new to manually manipulating images, so please bear with me.p  pI have an image that Im allowing the user to shrinkgrow and move around.p  pThe basic behavior works perfectly. However, I need to be able to grab whatever is in the viewport visible clipping region rectangle and save it out as a separate bitmap.p  pBefore I can do this, I need to get a fix on WHERE the image actually is and what is being displayed. This is proving more tricky than I would have imagined.p  pMy problem is that the Matrix documentation is absurdly vague, and Im lost as to how I can measure the coordinates and dimensions of my transformed image.  As I see it, the X,Y of the image remain constant even as the user shrinksgrows it.  So, even though it reports at being at 0,0 its displayed at say 100,100.  And the only way I can get those coordinates is to do a fairly ugly computation again... Im probably not doing it the most elegant way, since geometry is not my forte. p  pIm kind of hoping that Im missing something and that theres some way to pull the objects auto translated coordinates and dimensions. p  pin an ideal world I would be able to call pseudo codemyImg.getDisplayedWidthcode and codemyImg.getDisplayedXcode.p  pOh, and I should add that this may all be a problem that Im causing myself by using the center of the image as the point from which to growshrink.  If I left the default 0,0 coordinate as the non changing point, I think the location would be correct no matter what its size was.  So... maybe the answer to all this is to simply figure out my center offset and apply that to my translationsp  pAll help greatly appreciated and people not arbitrarily messing with my questions title even more so.p

Negative 5282 pSay Im making a game using the new storyboard feature in Xcode and I have the main menu navigation controller as my initial view controller. Then when the user starts a new game I then load the gameplay view controller using a modal segue, for example. The navigation controller would still be my root view controller while Im doing all of my rendering etc., rightp  pMy question is how much overhead does this take up Does it hurt the performance of my game to just have the nav controller hanging around back there If youve built an iPhone game, how have you handled the menusp  pI am also thinking about this because Im building in a little treasure hunt easter egg that uses the GPS. Once you get into that part of the app, youll never go back to the game. At that point since the GPS is in use, battery life is an issue. Does it hurt anything to have the game stuff sitting back there even though it will never be used again in the current life of the appp  pIve tried building a couple custom segues that actually change the root view controller to get around this, but writing custom segues is actually pretty nasty if you try to do anything that isnt simple. Im also not sure if thats the right move.p  pSorry if these are silly questions, Im pretty new to iOS.p

Negative 5282 pI have a form with 3 tabs one tab is for user entry and computations, a second tab shows values that will be used for computations which are read from one database I call it settings in that the values are constants for calculations but its not application settings in the way people think of it, to be clear and the third displays a table from another database. The second tab has a table adapter interface for the dataset that contains values used for calculations that can be changed to do different scenarios. Those numbers are read from a single record in a database that has 20 fields and was read once when the data is loaded into the second tab to be displayed.p  pThe problem I am having is that I would like to use the numbers from the second tab the constants in computations to be shown on the first tab. p  pI have tried declaring the variables on the second tab as public but they are already friends with the form event. However, when I go to use them in calculations, its like they dont exist. p  pFor example, one calculation I am doing is fuel cost. The user enters miles and this is stored as a variable called mileage. To calculate the result fuelcost, I have to use two other fields that are shown in the second tab MPG miles per gallon and fuelprice the price of gas. So fuelcost  mileagempgfuelprice. These are read from a datatable called testdata which is actually part of the project. I want to be able to use these variables throughout the program but declaring them as public isnt working.p  pHow do I make the variables from one tab usable elsewhere in the program The other thing I noticed is since the values of the variables are loaded into textboxes and assigned variable names by naming the textboxes, using val[variablename].text isnt solving the problem either. For example, saying milespergallon  valmpg.text is not doing the trick because I am getting a message that text is not an integer when I declare milespergallon.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHere the code that is being usedp  precodePrivate Sub Button1ClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Button1.Click     Dim mileage  Int32.ParseMiles.Text     Dim rate  0     Dim baserate  0     Dim rateper  0     Dim ratemile As Integer     Dim Mpg As Decimal     Dim milespergallon As Decimal     milespergallon  CDecMpg.Text      Ensure the value is numeric      If IsNumericMpg Then         Mpg  CDecMpg     Else         milespergallon  CDblMpg.Text     End If     txtmilespergallon.Text  milespergallon.ToString End Sub codepre  pTabPage2 is where the variables are displayed that I want to use in TabPage1. p  precodePrivate Sub TabPage2ClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles TabPage2.Click  End Sub codepre

Negative 5282 pThis is probably a permissions issue but I cant seem to figure it out. My app needs to store temp data while it runs so I use Path.GetTempPath to get the path to the temp dir, then come up with filename to use. My problem is that this works completely fine when run under the debugger, or when I simply start the exe from the release build but when the program is installed using a Setup project, the installed version fails. p  pIm using ManagedEsent for the temporary ondisk data storage  I dont know if this is relevant or not  and so Im passing the tempDir  filename to it. The error I get running the installed version is Error Cannot access file, the file is locked or in use which I think is being generated by Esent. Im only running a single thread on a single instance so there should be no contention on the file.p  pIs there some permission issue with an installed program writing to the Temp dir The temp dir path is what I would expect, usernameAppDataLocalTemp, in both the working and nonworking cases. Do I need to somehow grant permission to the app during installation to access that dir and, if so, how Thanks.p  pUPDATE App Details The application is not a windows service  its a fairly vanilla desktop application with a single main form plus a few dialogs. Framework Version 4. Im installing it via a Setup project. The Setup project has one custom action in which I initialize some data storage in the registry but the registry has nothing to do with temp data storage. p  pstrongFINAL UPDATE OK  it was a case of me being really dumb. There was a deeply buried statement, put there for debugging purposes, that switched the directory from the temp location to another one. So in the end it was a permission issue, just not with writing to TEMP. Ugh.strongp

MediaInfo has several properties representing the metadata is that what you call it of the Movie file, such as file length, file size, file path, etc. In order to extract this information, I use Shell32.p  pThe problem is that the methods provided in Shell32 are very, very slow. With 1 movie in my database, its not a problem, but with 10 movies, it starts becoming noticeable, and with 100 movies, it takes around 5 minutes for the program to load, and there are a few cases where I have to reinitialize the Movies during runtime, which again halts the flow of the program. p  pThe MediaInfo constructor calls the Initialize methodp  precode     ltsummarygt      Initializes all the information variables of the class.      ltsummarygt     private void Initialize              Folder mediaFolder  Shell32Processing.GetShellFolderthis.path          FolderItem media  Shell32Processing.GetShellFolderItemthis.path          initialize bit rate value         this.bitrate  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 28          initialize date accessed value         this.dateAccessed  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 5          initialize date created value         this.dateCreated  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 4          initialize date modified value         this.dateModified  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 3          initialize data rate value         this.dataRate  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 279          initialize file name value         this.fileName  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 155          initialize file type value         this.fileType  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 181          initialize folder value         this.folder  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 177          initialize folder name value         this.folderName  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 175          initialize folder path value         this.folderPath  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 176          initialize frame height value         this.frameHeight  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 280          initialize frame rate value         this.frameRate  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 281          initialize frame width value         this.frameWidth  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 282          initialize length value         this.length  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 27          initialize title value         this.title  FileProcessing.GetFileTitlethis.path          initialize total bitrate value         this.totalBitrate  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 283          initialize size value         this.size  mediaFolder.GetDetailsOfmedia, 1      codepre  pHere is the Shell32Processing.GetShellFolder methodp  precode     ltsummarygt      Gets a Shell32 Folder, initialized to the directory of the file path.      ltsummarygt      ltparam namepathgtA string representing the filefolder pathltparamgt      ltreturnsgtThe Shell32 Folder.ltreturnsgt     public static Folder GetShellFolderstring path              extract the folder subpath from the file path         i.e extract CExample from CExampleexample.avi          string directoryPath  new FileInfopath.Directory.ToString          return new Shell.NameSpacedirectoryPath      codepre  pAnd the Shell32Processing.GetShellFolderItem methodp  precode     ltsummarygt      Gets a Shell32 FolderItem, initialized to the item specified in the file path.      ltsummarygt      ltparam namepathgtA string representing the file path.ltparamgt      ltreturnsgtThe Shell32 FolderItem.ltreturnsgt      ltexception crefSystem.ArgumentExceptiongtThrown when the path parameter does not lead to a file.ltexceptiongt     public static FolderItem GetShellFolderItemstring path              if FileProcessing.IsFilepath                      throw new ArgumentExceptionPath did not lead to a file, path                   int index  1           get the index of the path item         FileInfo info  new FileInfopath         DirectoryInfo directoryInfo  info.Directory         for int i  0 i lt directoryInfo.GetFileSystemInfos.Count i                      if directoryInfo.GetFileSystemInfos.ElementAti.Name  info.Name weve found the item in the folder                              index  i                 break                                return GetShellFolderpath.Items.Itemindex      codepre  pEach call to GetDetailsOf which is code provided in Shell32 takes an incredible amount of time to process  I used the ANTS profiler to find this, because at first I wasnt able to identify what was slowing down my program so much.p  pSo the question is How can I optimize the Shell32 methods, and if I cant, is there an alternativep

You choose Plumbing for example and the second select box is empty. Im assuming the second query that builds the second select box is not working correctly.

Negative 5282 pI am trying to write a script for Linux on tcsh. I have not written a script since maybe 98 on Unix and that was very basic stuff. p  pI am trying to take a string and find sub strings in it. For example in a very long string that is a devices status Id like to find a sub sting the status  and if said sub string is found read the next wordstring following that sub string.p  pBasically I have a variable called INFO that is populated after sending out a command and I want to search it. I can of course loop through the whole thing but I know there are shorter ways of doing so, I just cant remember how anymore. p  pPlus if anyone knows of a decent source for script writing info that would be of use to me.p  pHope this makes sense. PS If it were my choice Id write this in straight up code and be done yesterday, but not my decision. p  pThanks.p

Negative 5282 pI am rather new to Flex and have a problem with a scrollbar for a textarea. Basically, I would want the textarea to have a vertical scrollbar that looks like the VSlider component, not like a VSrollBar. I.e. a line with a dot tracker, not a box with a box tracker.p  pNow I figured out how I could make a textarea with no scrollbars and link it to a seperate VSlider component and update via events, but I am pretty sure there should be some way to use only the textarea and set its scrollbar component to look like the VSlider instead of the VScrollBar.p  pCan anyone helpp

Negative 5282 pI have a Coolbar in VB6 which has has 6 Bands, each of these Bands has a Child of type Toolbar. The user can move these Bands around and set their visibility. I need to restore the settings when the software is restarted, but I am having some problems restoring the orderlocation I can restore the visibility and widths with no problems.p  pThe settings I am having problems restoring are Coolbar.BandsIndex.Position and Coolbar.BandsIndex.NewRow, as both of these properties are readonly.p  pI know I could save the Position and NewRow properties and then create each of the Bands at runtime instead of designtime, and then using the saved properties to determine the order in which to create the Bands. p  pI would prefer not to have to create the Bands at runtime but I suspect it may be the only way to restore these settings. Does anyone know of a way to restore the orderlocation of the Toolbars without having to create the Bands at runtimep  pI can saveload the settings easily enough, so we can skip that step.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advancep

The user can import data whenever they went. The issue is that occasionally some entries will be updated. In that case, I need all the entries in the table to be updated with whatever the last data added states. For example, if originally A has a value of 1, and the table is later updated with an entry that says A has a value of 3, I need to update the entire table to show that A only has a value of 3.p  pAlso, while I know how to do this on a query, I need to be able to do it on a table. Right now Ive thought of a couple of ideas, but none of them seem to work. Ive tried an update query along the lines ofp  precodeUPDATE tblData SET column2  LastColumn2 GROUP BY Column1 codepre  pbut this doesnt really seem to work. Ive also triedp  precodeUPDATE tblData Set Column2  DLastColumn2, tblData  codepre  pwhich is much closer. However its updating all the entries with the last record to look like thisp  precodeColumn 1  Column 2      A       3     B       3     A       3  codepre  pIm guessing this is because there is no GROUP BY clause to tell it to only do it for each instance of Column1, but through research it doesnt look like you can put a GROUP BY in an UPDATE statement. How should I approach this to get the result Im looking forp  pEDIT Also, while Im not 100 sure about this, I think the way to solve this is to use the third optional parameter of DLast, the [criteria] parameter. The only way I can think of using this is to specify an exact value for Column1 which is why Im not sure how to use it here, but I feel like there has to be a way to manipulate it to apply to each individual value of Column1.p

Negative 5282 pOkay, so Ive been trying out Vim the standard console version my OS is Linux Mint 13 and Id like to get rid of having to use the Escape key to change modes. Preferably, Id like to swap the Capslock and Escape keys, but as far as Ive heard, thats not possible within Vim itself. Most solutions Ive found involve changing the key on a global level using codexmodmapcode or whatever, but I dont really want that. If theres an easy way to swap Capslock and Escape strongonly in Vimstrong, please let me know.p  pAnother common thing Ive heard of is using Ctrl[ as an equivalent to Escape. However, because Im using a German keyboard with a different layout, thats not an option. So, I thought Id use codenoremap ltCgt ltEscgtcode in Vim the  key on a German keyboard is in the same place as the [ key on US keyboards, but that didnt work, either. Im assuming thats because  isnt an ASCII character. Is there any way to get either of these options workingp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Well, this is strange. After experimenting some more, it seems that Ctrl does work after all. Im not sure what happened  maybe I messed up some encodingrelated settings while trying different things If there is no good solution for remapping capslock, I guess I will stick with Ctrl.p

I already had a version of XCode, but because it might have problems, I uninstall it, then get version 3.2.6 my OS is too old for the newer versions. The install fails for unknown reasons, and it tells me to contact the software company. However, before it fails, it does install the UNIX tools, including gcc which I later got the latest version for, so I dont think thats the problem.p  pAll in all, this has consumed some 6 hours of my time today, and Im stressed and physically ill though I was this morning before starting this futile venture, but its been exacerbated, and I have no idea where I am supposed to go next.p  pIm hoping that its all been some stupid error thatll be remedied in 10 seconds by an experienced user, but I fear the worst. In general Ive done every bit of advice Ive found, from running with sudo to sacrificing a goat to the sun gods. Id appreciate any help.p

Negative 5282 pI find myself working with GUI code where the GUI program needs input focus and remain the topmost window, but whenever Im debugging with VS steppingthrough with F5F10F11 requires that VS has focus.p  pIs it possible to have VS intercept the Fkeys whilst the debugee has focus If VS doesnt have this functionality I imagine it should be possible to write a simple program or VS addin that has a keyboard book and commands the debugger accordingly  has anyone developed such a programp  pIm working with a GUI test automation framework that sends mouseclicks and other events by moving the cursor. When the debugee program is out of focus any click on its surface brings the main window forward but does not activate any controls, but the automation framework assumes that its focus of the application will never be interrupted. So if I set a breakpoint before a click that is meant to open the File menu then the click that is sent will only restore the debugees focus and not open the File menu if that makes sense.p  pIve done some searching but couldnt find anything immediately.p

Negative 5282 pI have a strange problem with a trigger.

However when many records are added simultaneously more than 1500 per second, problems started to occur. Some of the records added into profile had wrong info1, info2, info3 columns. For example in profile table i have values like p  precode id          info1       info2       info3        1              10          23          12       2              10          23          12       3              10          23          12       4              7           42          73       5              5           45          33       6              5           45          33       7              NULL        NULL        NULL    codepre  pMy problem is that rows 2, 3, 6 have wrong values for info1, info2 and info3, their values belong to another row.

Negative 5282 pIn my Windows Phone 7 application I have a number of list views. Each listViewItem has a click event By setting selectionChanged attribute to the listBox in my xaml. Now a very peculiar thing happensp  pWhen I click on an item in the listbox the first time everything goes well, in this case the user gets taken to another screen. When I go back from that screen to the listbox, I select the very same listboxitem but this time the event doesnt register, nothing happens...p  pI then first have to tap on another item, let that ones even fire, then only can I tap on the first item. So in other words, I cant fire a click event for a listItem twice in a row. Im thinking its because the event handler on the listbox says onSelectionChanged, if you select the same item the selection hasnt technically changed.p  pSo what other eventHandling attribute can I use on my listbox to register selection events on its itemsp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 5282 pMy question here is not about how to achieve something, but what all to include that would have the best effect for the content I am presenting.p  pI am designing an app probably with single screen which is story based. Not a story, but a scenario, to say. A typical scenario is driving through the street, going to office or both in one. And so on.p  pUpon each tap or any user activity, next step of the scenario will reveal itself. Like meeting a person, colliding with a car and so on. But since these scenarios are virtually infinite, it is not possible to design graphics for my app. To say in other words, it wont be an office, an attic, a castle or a house. It can be any of that, or a combination of them.p  pDue to this limitation, and partially my laziness to deal with a lot of graphics I dont have a subordinate, nor big bucks, I have decided to do some simple animation upon each tap. A single object like a ball can roll or emerge from nowhere etc. p  pMy questionsp  p1 Optional How do I achieve this animation I know objective c but I do not know if it suffice. Box2d is other option that I know of. Is it ok or an overkill If objective c suffices, can anyone help me with simple code that will animate a rolling ball from far center of the iphonep  p2 Required Above is something I can figure out by myself, but this is more important How do I devise my other UI to describe the scene and situation What all iOS features would fit the best in situation I can think of single UILabel to describe situation, but I do not know how I can positionanimate it along with 1 above. Again, this seems far too simplistic however. Are there other iOS views that could help me p  pSorry for somewhat ambiguous requirement, but I am facing lack of imagination here, and I know if I am misled at this step, a lot of things can go wrong.p  pThank you for your assistance.p

Negative 5282 pIm writing a 3D raytracer as a personal learning project a hrefhttpsgithub.commikeraenlightEnlighta and have run into an interesting problem related to doing intersection tests between a ray and a scene of objects.p  pThe situation isp  ul liI have a number of primitives that rays can intersect with spheres, boxes, planes, etc. and groups thereof. Collectively Im calling these scene objects.li liI want to be able to scene objects primitives with arbitrary affine transformations by wrapping them in a codeTransformcode object importantly, this will enable multiple instances of the same primitives to be used in different positions in the scene since primitives are immutableli liScene objects may be stored in a bounding volume hierarchy i.e. Im doing spatial partitioningli liMy intersection tests work with codeRaycode objects that represent a partial ray segment start vector, normalised direction vector, start distance, end distanceli ul  pThe problem is that when a ray hits the bounding box of a Transform object, it looks like the only way to do an intersection test with the transformed primitives contained within is to transform the codeRaycode into the transformed coordinate space. This is easy enough, but then if the ray doesnt hit any transformed objects I need to fall back to the original codeRaycode to continue the trace. Since Transforms may be nested, this means I have to maintain a whole stack of codeRaycodes for each intersection trace that is done. p  pThis is of course within the inner loop of the whole application and the primary performance bottleneck. It will be called millions of times a second so Im keen to minimise complexity  avoid unnecessary memory allocation.p  pIs there a clever way to avoid having to allocate new codeRaycodes  keep a codeRaycode stackp  pOr is there a cleverer way of doing this altogetherp

Negative 5282 pstrongCurrent situationstrongp  pI have a WPF application where I use MVVM and NHibernate. I have a masterdetail window with a listbox with all my customers, and the selectedItem of the listbox is the object that is being used to display the customerdetails in the detailscreen.  In the detailscreen I have an add, edit, delete, save and an undo buttton. Everything works with the binding Ive set up. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pBut for my undo button I was thinking of making a copy of the original Customer object so when I click the undo button the field will be resetted to the values from the original values. But in my customer object I have an Address object and with a shallow copy the 2 objects will keep the same reference to that object. So when I change a field from the Address object the original Customer address will also be changed. I was thinking of doing a deep copy of my Customer address but I cant make my object serializable Its not in my control to change the Model objectsp  ul liIs there any way to do a deep copy without serializationli liOr is there some standard way to accomplish the behavior I want to achieveli ul

Negative 5282 pThanks for taking the time to look, guys. Im creating a pretty basic AJAX contact form using jQuery. The email sends, but upon opening the email there is no POST data, so I just get the strings I defined in the PHP script. On my phones email client, the content of the email literally says undefined. Ive tried adding different types of header data to no avail, and a number of variations on the PHP mail function. p  pI am more than willing to adopt an easier solution for a simple AJAX form, so thanks in advance for any new approaches. p  pHere is the form     p  precode   ltsection idleftgt       ltlabel forformnamegtNameltlabelgt       ltinput nameformname idformname typetext gt        ltlabel forformemailgtEmailltlabelgt       ltinput nameformemail idformemail typeemail gt    ltsectiongt     ltsection idrightgt       ltlabel forformmsggtMessageltlabelgt       lttextarea nameformmsg idformmsggtlttextareagt       ltinput idsubmit classbutton namesubmit typesubmit valueSendgt    ltsectiongt  ltformgt codepre  pThe jQuery AJAXp  precodefunction      contact .button.clickfunction          var name  formname.val         var email  formemail.val         var text  msgtext.val         var dataString  name name  ampemail  email  amptext  text          .ajax             type POST,             url email.php,             data dataString,             success function             .success.fadeIn1000                                return false       codepre  pThe PHP script external file email.phpp  precodeltphp ifPOST     name  POST[formname]     email  POST[formemail]     message  POST[formmsg]  send email     mailj.andrew.searsgmail.com, 51 Deep comment from .email, message  gt codepre

Negative 5282 pemDISCLAIMERem Im likely the wrong person to ask this, as I am only a designer in this scenario and know precisely jack about iOS development.p  pemDISCLAIMER OF DISCLAIMERem I am however a proficient PHP and JS programmer, so the artsense of development is not completely lost on me.p  pNow, the design were trying to reproduce calls for a header bar. Currently its a UINavigationBar. However, that element apparently doesnt allow for sufficient customization.p  ul liThe bar should have a height of 110 pixels Retina.li liIt should not have a gloss, a border or a visible background the entire screen should have the same static unmoving background image.li liThe bar should only have a drop shadow which is also an image, any internal drop shadow effect will not suffice when the content below it has been scrolled. In other words, the drop shadow image is an indicator that some content is up here. If I remember correctly from my Galaxy days, such behavior is familiar to Android users.li ul  pIve attached a part of the design mockup herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combDrlX.png altDesign mockup showcasing the bar behaviorp  pWhat is the path of least resistance to achieve this effect with the native UINavigationBar if possible, but no sweat if notp

Negative 5282 pI wanted to index text files. After searching a lot I got to know about Apache tika. Now in some sites where I studied Apache tika, I got to know that Apache tika converts the text it into XML format and then sends it to solr.

I want each line to have lineid .......  So that i can easily retrieve the matching line.p  pCan this be done in Apache Tikap

Negative 5282 pI have read allot of questions on here about different ways to initialize a ActiveRecord model properly when dealing with initializing values and is always in relation to providing default values. A great a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions328525whatisthebestwaytosetdefaultvaluesinactiverecordanswera I came across helped clarify different ways.p  pHowever, if it is frowned upon to override the ActiveRecord base initialize method, what is the proper way to provide parameters to an ActiveRecord model when you want to initialize with values as you would in a standard Ruby class codeinitializearg1, arg2...code method.p  pso you can p  precodeobj  MyObject.newObj1, somenum codepre  pThe only thing I have come across was actually overrideing the codeinitializecode method but calling codesupercode first in the initialize.  However, this was frowned on because ActiveRecords base class uses codeallocatecode in allot of cases to instantiate an AR object and therefore could end up sidestepping the entire initialize method.p  pSo, maybe there is another fundamental reason why I am not finding providing initial values as a standard practice in RoRp  pI know I can use validates in the object to validate an object cant be saved without meeting requirements, such as having all the proper attributes set.  But I was approaching this particular object, so that it wouldnt be created without the required attributes when it is initialized to begin since at initialization we would have all that information and if retrieving from the DB we would have all those values.p  pCan someone help direct mep  pstrongextra questionstrong If there is an accepted way to do the above, there seems to be another area that needs to be considered when initializing objects with values and that is when the object is initialized from being retrieved from the DB.  Not handling the initializing values properly can possibly override what is retrieved from the DB or I have read when related to setting attributes to default values.  So if that needs to be handled properly, how do we do thatp

Negative 5282 pThis question is a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15263390jsf20cdiinjectedsessionbeanwithinrequestbeancontainsnullpropertiesherea.p  pUpon login, my app needs to consult the container for authentication using request.login and then set a User bean, which contains username, password, role, and a locationspecific field.  Upon successful authorization against the container WAS 8, the users role needs to be checked to figure out the appropriate welcome page to where the user should be redirected.  My container implements a federated repository, which basically lumps together 3 LDAP branches, a database, and a flat file.  There are many roles 5 for now, probably will be more later.p  pI have 2 beans a RequestScoped Credentials bean and a SessionScoped bean named Login.  Login contains a login method.  I have a problem in side the login method.p  pMy problem is that whenever I usep  precodePrincipal userPrincipal  request.getUserPrincipal request.getUserPrincipal if userPrincipal  null      request.logout  request.logincredentials.getUsername, credentials.getPassword String name  userPrincipal.getName codepre  pbeforep  precodeDonor donor  loginService.getDonorcredentials.getUsername currentUser  new Users currentUser.setLocationdonor.getCenter.getCity currentUser.setRoleDONOR currentUser.setUserIdcredentials.getUsername currentUser.setFirstNamedonor.getFirstName currentUser.setLastNamedonor.getLastName currentUser.setUsernamecredentials.getUsername currentUser.setNamecredentials.getUsername return usersfacesredirecttrue codepre  pmy currentUser User bean isnt stored in the session.p  pIve removed the first chunk of code and noticed that my User beans info is then stored in the session and can be viewed on the subsequent users page.  Ive reintroduced the first chunk of code line by line and noticed thatp  precodeif userPrincipal  null      request.logout  codepre  pcauses the problem.p  pHow the heck am I supposed to store a User bean implementing programmatic security and JSF2.0CDI  Ive spent weeks on this.  I can imagine implementing something more elaborate like a filter that catches the redirect, grabs the userprincipal, calls the db or ldap for additional attributes, and then redirects to the appropriate page...but I want to keep things simple.  There has got to be a simple way to do this.p  pI originally tried my hand at login using jsecuritycheck and specifying FORM in web.xml.  Now, using a JSF 2.0 form and a login method, I noticed that FORM gets ignored in favor of BASIC. System.out.printlngetAuthType..  request.getAuthType returns BASIC within the login method.  This results in an annoying cache, which is why request.logout is required.  Otherwise, request.login will fail.p  pI stumbled across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10154202howdoidosecurityinjsfthisa last night, which contains a link to a hrefhttpsblogs.oracle.comenterprisetechtipsentryimprovingjsfsecurityconfigurationwith relnofollowherea.  So, there may be a way to obtain the userprincipal, set a User bean, and redirect to an appropriate welcome page.  I dont know how outdated that 2nd link is though.  It also seems to be the case that jsecuritycheck cant be used in tandem with a programmatic means of determining which page I should redirect a user to based on role.p  pAs to whether I should use jsecuritycheck or programmatic securityJSFCDI, I just need to figure out something that is simple and allows me to store the Login bean or an independent User bean in the session.p  pHeres my login

Im attempting to use the Header Property Expression to append the header to the detail records.p  p00                  REPLICATE0,6LENDTSTR,6,1252 [UserRecordCountA1200]  DTSTR,6,1252 [UserRecordCountA1200]  PAYAMT  P1200000000000000000000                    p  pThe payment amount field is a data type of currency. My first thought was to use the aggregate transformation and store it in a recordset destination. My aggregate worked to give me the correct sum, but the variable can only be stored as an object and not a numerical data type as I was originally expecting. I would like to take the sum of the PayAmount for all of the records and put it into a user defined variable called SumAmountA1200.p  pIs it possible to store a value from an aggregate transformation into some other type of transformation and turn it into a package level variable Should I go about doing this another way Any feedback is greatly appreciatedp
Negative 5282 pIm new to web services and I created a basic project in eclipse with one exposed method. I was able to deploy my webservice and it works fine. The code is below.p  precodeimport javax.jws.WebMethod import javax.jws.WebParam import javax.jws.WebService  WebServicetargetNamespacehttptest.com, nametestService public class WebService      WebMethodoperationNamestart     public String startWebParamnameinputParameter String inputParameter          return startMethodinputParameter       codepre  pMy question is how do I set up this method to deal with complex types. I want to receive a number of parameters, but I dont want to just receive them as a bunch of strings. I was thinking of having some sort of wrapper object that contained all the parameters I need for my method. Any advice on how to do this Do I need additional annotations to create the WSDL Thanksp
Negative 5282 pI need to develop an image labeling application, for this task Im considering using Conditional Random Fields CRF over a set of superpixels, there exists quite a few papers that point out this technology as the state of the art for this task. As usual the task could be devided into two tasksp  ul liTraining model which for this problem would be obtaining the parameter vector w, using for example li liTesting which would be obtaining the most feasible label assignment of a given set of superpixels, i.e argmaxPyxli ul  pIm aware of trainingtime to be quite high, however I have not found anything about testingtime nor performance, does anyone have and idea of how much time could take the testing problem I suppose it will depend on the number of labels, image size, implementation, hardware, etcp
Negative 5282 pI have found several questions on stackoverflow that relate to this issue, but mine is a little unique and I have not been able to figure out a solution. Im also not a css expert, go figure.p  pMy situation is as follows I have a string inside a div that must be displayed with the following constraintsp  pUsing the following string as an example The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs, again and again.p  ol liThe middle of the text must be aligned in the middle of the div.li liDiv can be 100 wide, but must be restricted to one line. If the window is too small, truncation of text should happen on either side but the center of the text must always be visible. For example, if the window is too small, the div contents may be over the, with the rest being truncated on either side, and so on.li ol  pWhat css can help me achieve this I have tried the following to no availp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltstyle typetextcss gt     div          width100         bordersolid 1px black         textalign center         verticalalignmiddle         display tablecell         whitespacenowrap         overflowhidden      ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdivgt The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs, again and again as well too. ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe motivation here is that I am trying to create a mobile web app that will show some search results in a list. The search text will always be highligted, and I want to make sure it is always visible in the list. So if the search query was lazy dogs, I cannot fit the entire search result in one line, so Ill need to fit it in a div that is 100 wide with lazy dogs shown in the middle, with excess text truncated on either side.p  pSo the user might see something like this as one of the results in the list. The ... are not necessary, shown here for clarificationp  p... the blazy dogsb, again...p  pFurthermore, when user switches the device orientation between landscape and portrait, the list item should gracefully exand and show more text.p  pI am sure there is an elegant css way to do this, instead of messy javascript route that I am now contemplating.p  pPlease let me know if I can provide any clarifications or if there is an alternative way of achieving what I am trying to do. Or perhaps this is not a good UI design choice to begin withp  pAs always, any help is greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp  pMohammadp
Negative 5282 pSo, Ive got some pretty basic code that I cant get to work quite right. Im using the ezSQL class a hrefhttpjustinvincent.comezsql relnofollowhttpjustinvincent.comezsqla, but thats working fine. Everything works fine, except when I try to use a sanitize function getpost. Im using two other functions, sanitizeString and sanitizeMySQL when I call the function getpost. If I just POST the data right to the SQL table, it works fine. Its only when I go thru the post function that it breaks. Heres the posting bitp  precodeif issetPOST[username] ampamp issetPOST[password]      username  getpostusername     password  getpostpassword     dbgtqueryINSERT INTO users VALUES username, password  codepre  pLike I said, Im using a class thats what the dbquery stuff is about, but thats working perfectly. If I change the code to thisp  precodeif issetPOST[username] ampamp issetPOST[password]      username  POST[username]     password  POST[password]     dbgtqueryINSERT INTO users VALUES username, password  codepre  pit works fine.  Here are the three functions Im using for sanitizingp  precode  Sanitize Functions function sanitizeStringvar   if getmagicquotesgpc var  stripslashesvar  var  htmlentitiesvar  var  striptagsvar  return var       function sanitizeMySQLvar   var  mysqlrealescapestringvar  var  sanitizeStringvar  return var       function getpostvar   return sanitizeMySQLPOST[var]  codepre  pIve even tried just changing the getpost function to contain a mysqlrealescapestring return, and even that doesnt work. Also, I guess I should clarify what actually happens when I try to use the getpost function. It appears to create a new row in the table, but with completely empty cells. Hope you guys can shed some light on what Im doing wrong Im a pretty experienced frontend developer, but Im kinda learning the ropes with serverside stuff. Thanks p  pninjaEdit I found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2940030arethesetwofunctionsoverkillforsanitizationAre these two functions overkill for sanitizationa which is definitely helpful in making my sanitize functions better, but it doesnt really help me with why mine arent working in the first place. p

Negative 5282 pI am trying to build a list of games that I have. I have a class named gameCommonp  precodeclass gameCommon  public string name int price  codepre  pThis is the common information all games have.

Negative 5282 pThere are a lot of questionsanswers about how to start an application from within your application in Android. But those solutions do not produce the same flow as if an icon was tapped in Android launcher. For example, I do this this is used with notificationsp  precodeintent  context.getPackageManager.getLaunchIntentForPackagecom.test.startup intent.setActionIntent.ACTIONMAIN intent.addCategoryIntent.CATEGORYLAUNCHER intent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK  pendingIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitycontext, 0,             intent, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT codepre  pThen when I tap on notification the app is started, however, it is started somewhat differently than when I tap the icon in the App drawer. Specifically with this approach my main Activity is emalwaysem created i.e. onCreate then onResume is called. However, if application was already started and then put in background, then starting it from Launcher will only cause onResume of currently shown activity to be called not onCreate on the main one. Is there a way to trigger the same resume flow programmatically from within my app p  pTo summarize the task when user taps on notification I need my app to be either started if its not already, or brought to the foreground in its current state if its in background  and have some data passed to it. The app will then take care of handlingrendering that data.p

Then I heard, that WebView is able to load stuff from resources with codefileandroidrescode as base url.p  pSo I was wondering, I could use this to my .css file in coderawcode folder, and leverage the resource system with qualifiers coderawlandcode, coderawsw720code etc., like you normally would when styling layouts.p  pUnfortunatelly, this doesnt seem to work, even if I do something like codefileandroidresrawlandcode but hardcoding the path kinda defeats the purpouse anyways.p  pSo .. is there any solution to this My biggest worry is using pixels as units, but webview seems to adjust stuff on its own, rightp  pThanksp

Negative 5282 pUp until today Ive been using MVVM Lights EventToCommand for event handling in XAML. I decided to try out InputBinding for mouse events and so far the results have been far from pleasing.

Can anybody explain me, what are disadvantages of this approach and what I am missing Thanks a lot.p  precode The base class constructor function Animalname      var name  name  local variable, not visible to subclass      this.greeting  function              return Hello, name           this.makeSound  function              return Dont know what to say         The subclass constructor function Cowname      Animal.callthis, name  call the base constructor      this.makeSound  function   override base classs method              return Mooooo        var myCow  new CowBurenka  console.logmyCow.greeting   call inherited method console.logmyCow.makeSound  call overriden method codepre  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong Thanks to everybody for answers and comments. Just to summarizep  pThis approach can be used, but there are some limitationsp  ul liEvery instance construction is performed from scratch rather than just setting a link to prototype  this may affect performance.li liEvery instance contains definitions of all the base classs methods  wasting memory.li licodeinstanceofcode wont work properly i.e. wont treat the subclass instance as a base class instance.li liIf you override a method this way, you can not call the implementation from the base class when you need it if you want just extend the functionality, not replace it completely.li liIf you want to change the implementation of base classs methods dynamically, you need prototypes.li ul  hr  pAnd of course there are other questions here for the same subject.

Negative 5282 pThis is kind of a design question. I am fairly new to Android development. I know I could make this work, but want to make sure I am doing it the right way.p  pSo I want my app to have a nav at the top. Similar to this p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLmiiE.png althttpcdn.thenextweb.comwpcontentblogs.dir1files201211b8220x373.pngp  pI also have 4 categories. Some categories will have multiple pages or activities, but each will have a base activity that will be displayed when that nav button is hit. I want the current nav category to be highlighted when that category is being viewed even if the current activity is a subpage of that category.p  pTo accomplish this, I have created a header activity that subclasses FragmentActivity. It just has a row of buttons and then the majority of the page is a linear layout. This linear layout is populated with the current activity. This all works and seems like a good way of doing this part. strongDoes this seem like a good solutionstrongp  pBut I am a bit confused about keeping track of which activity and navigation category is being viewed so that I can highlight the selected nav button and not load the activity if a category button is hit, but the base page for that category is currently being viewed. What I am thinking about doing is what is suggested here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13994622361815httpstackoverflow.coma13994622361815a. Basically, I will keep an app wide variable of the current activity. And then in my header class, I will check this value and not load a new activity if that is the current page. Something like thisp  precode   public void goToSearchPageView view          todo highlight button          Activity currentActivity  getCurrentActivity          if the current activity is not the main page start that activity.         ifcurrentActivity  MainActivity.class                    Intent intent  new Intentthis, MainActivity.class           startActivityintent                    public Activity getCurrentActivity          return MyAppthis.getApplicationContext.getCurrentActivity      codepre  pI know the if statement will not work, strongbut am just wondering if this is the best practice for this design. I also wanted to make sure I was utilizing and interacting with activities properly.strongp

Negative 5282 pIm using ASP.NET Identity with a new website and there dont seem to be many any examples of how to do this in a decoupled manner. I do not want my domain models codeDomainUsercode class to have to inherit from codeMicrosoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework.Usercode, so Ive created a class that looks like thisp  precodepublic class IdentityUser  User      public virtual DomainUser DomainUser  get private set   codepre  pIve moved the codeDbSetcodes required by ASP.NET Identity into the same derived codeDbContextcode class as my domain models a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19308959setoauthconnectionstringpropertyinnet4511991339819913398as illustrated in this answera. Ive linked the codeIdentityUsercode unidirectionally to the codeDomainUsercode via Fluent API like sop  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltIdentityUsergt.HasRequirediu gt iu.DomainUser.WithRequiredPrincipal codepre  pThis allows me to mostly separate the concerns of authorization and authentication from the behaviors defined in the codeDomainUsercode class. This is better than combining them into one class, but it still feels ugly. I still have references to the required ASP.NET Identity assemblies in my Domain project. I could create yet another project that held only my IdentityUser class and a reference to my Domain assembly to allow for the navigation property, but that starts to feel convoluted. p  pI feel like there should be a better, cleaner, more modular way to link Identity up to the domain without it resulting in tight coupling. p  pHas anyone come up with a better way of handling this Im hoping to garner the attention of those involved in the ASP.NET Identity project a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1459890haokungHao Kunga et al to provide direction here.p

Negative 5282 pI am dealing with an app Win Forms  VS 2010 that loads a lot of contact data during its startup. Thats working fine.p  pA new requirement is that this app lets call it the main app  can also show a modal dialog and in that dialog the user can view data of different contacts. But the main app which is behind the modal dialog would also need to load the contact data every time the user changes the contact in the modal dialog as both windows can be visible to the user making the main app invisible is not an option. So the modal dialog and the main app need to be in sync.p  pMy question is I would like to load the changed contact into the main app in the background in this scenario as that loading requires a little bit of time due to business logic being run every time a contact is loaded.p  pWe have got the code for the main app that is used to load a contact into the main app out of the main app itself i.e. executed on the main thread and that is working well.p  pBut how would I reuse that code when it is being executing on a separate thread in the background behind the modal dialog My concern is that this code that loads a contact on the main app does a lot of GUI updates and ideally I wouldnt want to change all the GUI updates in that existing code to see e.g. if an invoke is required etc because the existing code is now not executed on the main thread.p  pAny ideas are appreciated.p

Negative 5282 pI am trying to open a local java app for profiling with VisualVM but it has suddenly stopped working since I last used it a week ago, I can see the programs in the applications box but if I try to open my program launched from the cmd line or any other java program like eclipse it will just hang with the status bar saying opening. If it try to select another VM to open while it is trying to open my own app, visualVM will lock up.p  pNote that I can open and profile the visualVM JVM but not any other, p  pI havent changed any settings other than performing general OS updates including the kernel. I have made sure my tmphsperfdatamyusername is accessable and I can see file numbers matching the process pid created in the folder when I launch visual VM, eclipse or my own java program from the command line.

Negative 5282 pI have undergone one problem in C in logic creation.What i have to do isp  p1I have array codea[215]  0,1,2,3,4,5code.Now i have to add two minimum elements of this array and then position the newly element obtained in the same array such that it will maintain the increasing order of the arraya[],which was already sorted array. p  p2I also have to take care that the two minimum added elements must not participate in sorting and addition again, they must be fixed at their position once if they are already added, but the newly obtained element by addition can participate in addition and sorting again. eg we add two minimum element code0 and 1, 011, so 1code is the result obtained by addition, now this code1code must be positioned in a[] such that still  there should be increasing order.  so p  precode0 1 1added here 2 3 4 5 codepre  pNow we have to again find the minimum two nodes emplease read the comment 2 again to understand wellem .We cannot add code0 abnd 1code again because they have already participated in in the addition. so this time we will add 1 and 2this one is at index three, please dont get confused wwith the one at index two. so we get 123p  pcode0 1 1 2 3 3 4 5code  we again positioned 3 to maintain increasing order. we repeat again for element at index 4 and 5because we have already done addition for element at index 0,1 and 2,3 we will get code336code, again position it in a[].p  pcode0 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6code  this time 6 is greater then 4 and 5 so it will appear after 5 to maintain increasing order.p  precodeAt last we will get a[] like this a[ ] [0 1 1 2 3 3  4 5 6 9 15]. codepre  pso the addition held was between index 0,1 and 2,3 and 4,5 and 6, 7  and 8,9 and at last we have 15 which is last one, so here we stops.p  pemNow coming to how much i have already implementedem  I have implemented this addition part, which do addition on array codea[ ]  [0 1 2 3 4 5]code.

Negative 5282 pHello and thank you ahead of time. I am attempting to write a program that adds,subtracts,and multiplies numbers in an array that java wont sign. I am having trouble with my subtract method. I need to nest a another method inside this method that will allow me to make a clone of the number I am subtracting, and utilize it to take the place of the original number in the arrayso I will be able to use that number for multiply. I keep getting a compiler error of 1 not a complete statement or 2  expected. p  precode    class Integer          public Integer subtractInteger bi          private Integer clone                              codepre  p This is the line I am having trouble with. I am executing this method inside of an object called b1, and subtracting the bi from it. I have all of the other code correct in my program, I just dont know how to nest this line of code correctly. Again thanks    p

Negative 5282 pI have several MDI multitabbed Winforms apps that I wrote, using DevExpress controls DocumentManager and BarManager, that I am trying to add behavior such that undocking a child form FormEditor and dragging out of the container will create a new instance of the container FormMaster.2 and add the child to it, so the child form is always within an MDI container. Im trying to achieve the effect similar to tab docking in Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc.p  pSo far, my approach has resulted in a disappearing child and a .NET Exception   strongemToplevel style of a parented control cannot be changedemstrongp  pEDITED In the original question, I noted that I tried hooking into ParentChanged event, and instantiating a new instance of my MDI Parent Form for proof of concept. That was only temporary because that event fires immediately when the child is undocked, which is too soon. I set the child.ParentChanged event to check for Parent  null, and then created a new FormMaster container and set MdiParent within the same event. It didnt work.p  pstrongANSWERstrong DmitryG pointed me to the DevExpress  BaseView.FloatingDocumentContainer property. Setting DocumentManager.View.FloatingDocumentContainer  DocumentsHost. Using that is enough for a default solution, but youll probably want to go a step further and override the default container with your own form. The CustomDocumentsHostWindow event allowed me to provide a constructor to instantiate my specific, custom MDI Parent form. The form has to implement IDocumentsHostWindow interface, the bare minimum of which is only two simple properties.p  pThanks to DmitryG for the correct answer.

Negative 5282 pI am trying to compare words in a csv txt file to those in another csv txt file using Python. I am then trying to calculate a score based on their similarity. One file Answer.txt contains answers for a test. The other Test.txt contains both the definitions and answers of the test. The problem is that I am fairly new to coding and that both files have a different layout. For example, Answers.txt has a layout like thisp  precodedog,cat,sheep codepre  pTest.txt has a layout like thisp  precodedefinition1,def2,def3 dog,cat,sheep codepre  pFor every row in Answer.txt I am trying to compare each word to the last row in Test.txt. I am also trying to calculate a score based on the matching words. If a word matches, I would like 2 marks to be awarded. For examplep  pIf the answers in Answer.txt sayp  precodedog,cat,sheep codepre  pAnd the answers in Test.txt sayp  precodedog,cat,sheep codepre  p... A score of 6 will be calculated. However, if the answers in Answers.txt sayp  precodedog cat,shep codepre  p... Then 4 points will be awarded, because sheep does not match Test.csv.p  pI would then like this score to be added to the end of a record in another file called Score.txt.p  pSorry for the trouble. This is just about as simplified as I can make my explanation. Youre help will be massively appreciatedp  pAddedp  pI have no idea where to start. I have, however, written the function which stores the users input in Answers.txtp  precodedef askquestionnumber, definition      Asks a question for definition number      print Definition  .formatnumber, definition     return rawinputAnswer   def sitatest     results  []     with openTest.txt, rb as f         for row in csv.readerf             results.appendlistaskquestionno, def for no, def in enumeraterow      with openScore.txt, wb as f         writer  csv.writerf         writerow.writerowsresults codepre

Negative 5282 pI am using Visual Studio 2013, and have a Web Application that I am trying to squash a few bugs. Previously I was able to start debugging, make a change to the user control then refresh the page and see the change. Now I have to stop the debugger and rebuild the entire project before the change shows. I am only changing the markup things like inline css, HTML, etc and not any of the code behind so a recompile shouldnt be necessary. I have verified that this is not a browser cache issue, as I have used several browsers, and cleared the cache after loading the page. I also used incognito mode to make certain nothing was cached. Any ideas on how I can fix thisp

I am providing a small javascript to create the required chart.p  precodeAmCharts.readyfunction   var chartData  [x10, y14, value59,       x5, y3, value50,       x10, y3, value19,       x6, y5, value65,       x15, y4, value92,       x13, y1, value8,       x1, y6, value35]  var chart  new AmCharts.AmXYChart         chart.pathToImages  ....amchartsjavascriptimages chart.dataProvider  chartData chart.marginLeft  35 chart.startDuration  1.5  var xAxis  new AmCharts.ValueAxis xAxis.position  left xAxis.autoGridCount  true chart.addValueAxisxAxis  var yAxis  new AmCharts.ValueAxis yAxis.position  bottom yAxis.autoGridCount  true chart.addValueAxisyAxis                  var graph  new AmCharts.AmGraph graph.valueField  value graph.xField  x graph.yField  y graph.lineAlpha  0 graph.bullet  round chart.addGraphgraph  var chartCursor  new AmCharts.ChartCursor chart.addChartCursorchartCursor  var chartScrollbar  new AmCharts.ChartScrollbar chartScrollbar.hideResizeGrips  false chart.addChartScrollbarchartScrollbar  var legend  new AmCharts.AmLegend chart.addLegendlegend  chart.writechartdiv      codepre  pPlease reply if any one knows this problem.p

Negative 5282 pI am writing a c program and I am a noob in c, although i am just fine in programming , i know C and C. My program basically scans an image and locates the circle in that image and distinguishes them according to the coordinates of their centers.

But i couldnt do it so far. I tried using GetBrightness in the color struct and get HUE but i couldnt specify what pixel i want it to work on. I hope i made myself clear and ask me for any more details. I will mention again that i am a noob in C , all i know is C and Cp

Negative 5282 pWe have a scheduled task on a codeWindows Server 2012R2code machine which launches a custom built .NET application starting at 8AM each day and running once every hour.  The application communicates with a codeSQL Server 2012code Database Server different machine via Entity Framework to fetch some data and do different things locally.  This configuration has worked without incident.p  pRecently, we codeupdated the applicationcode to make an additional call to the database, only this time using codeADO.NETcode and a codeStored Procedurecode.  This works strongMOST of the timestrong.p  pWeve noticed during the hours of 9PM and 4AM we are receiving Login failed for user exceptions   codeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException 0x80131904code.  I see these in logging done by the .NET application and also in the Windows Event Log on the Database server.  p  pBoth Entity Framework and the ADO.NET calls are using the same connection string which used SQL authentication.  Ive verified this with some additional logging.  Also, manually connecting to SQL Server via SSMS using the credentials from the connection string works without error.  We also see the application running, connecting, and processing data without error for most of the day again, verified by logging.  Based on all of this, I have come to the conclusion that this is not actually a usernamepassword authentication issue but rather something on the SQL Server side happening during this time that is preventing login.p  pMy first guess was that a database backup might be locking the DB in some way or putting it in single user mode.  Looking at the DB maintenance plan, I see that the DB is operating in Full recovery mode, performing one full backup daily at 12AM, differential backups every hour and Tlog backups every 15 minutes.  These errors are consistently happening inbetween backups so I dont think backups are the issue.  p  pOne interesting thing I see on the Database server.  In the Windows Event Log for the Login failed for user error event, if I look at the binary data in the event, it shows codeHDB02.mastercode.  codeDB02code is the database server name.  Im not sure if the H or reference to the master DB in this context is indicative of the problem or something else.p  pLastly, I dont see any additional logging of events on the sql server or the application server that offer any more clues into why this is happening.  Ive scoured our source control for any code changes that may be contributing to this but nothing stands out.p  pAny additional suggestions on things I can look into would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pUp until now this has exclusively happened only from the console application but just this afternoon it was triggered when we published an ASP.NET application that uses the same database, but a different SQL user.  Both applications are C applications.p

Negative 5282 pI have an app that deals with Shape POCO objects. I retrieve these shape objects from an angular js ShapeService. Shapes can have a width and height, and can also be told to maintain their aspect ratio. To do this then, I need to know when the width or height has changed so that I can auto change the other to maintain its ratio. The question is, where do I put this logic It would make sense to me that this logic belongs to the Shape object itself, but Im not sure how I get the shape obect to enforce it.p  pShould the Shape object be able to enforce this rule within itself if so how Should it be the services responsibility how would I do this without having the service watch my controllers model Some other way Im not thinking ofp

Im using regular codemalloccode in user mode app in order to create the buffer for reading or writing which in his turn is passed to the  codeReadFilecode and codeWriteFilecode commands and from there goes to storport and then ioctls created by storport passed to my driver. the identify device structure returns the ability to readwrite max size of code128kcode in a single command. and now for the questionp  pwhen Im allocating the buffer with regular codemalloccode and im trying to send a readwrite command of size code128kcodein mode No.2 I see in the driver that the command is sent in 2 commandsp  pfirst part is code124Kcode and the second part is code4Kcode the storport divides it into 2 commandsp  pbut when i use codeallignedmalloccode to allocate the buffer passed ,  where the buffer is pagealigned 4096aligned i can read and write 128k in a single command.p  pwhereas in mode No.1 where I pass the Ioctl directly to my driver there is no such requirement and I can read and write code128kcode in a single command with a regular codemalloccode to allocate the buffer. p  pMy main questions arep  p1.why the storport needs the buffer passed to it to be pagealigned in order to readwrite 128k the max transaction valuep  p2.why is it always sending 124k and then 4k when the buffer is not aligned in mode No.2 when trying to send 128k.p

Negative 5282 pI read about about codePersistence Contextcode but not able to get a clear picture about my doubts which are as follows.br 1. I have a DAO class which as a codePersistenceContextunitName private EntityManager entityManagercode and from my Service method i am starting the transactionSpring Managed using Transactionalpropagation  Propagation.REQUIRED. I understand here is every time this Service method is called, a Transaction will start and when it reaches to DAO class it will use the same Transaction but for every EntityManager operation it look for Active PersistenceContext and create it as required. Is this approach correct and thread safe So, if a new thread starts the same service method then a new Transaction and a persistence Context will be created and flushed away when the method endsbr 2. I have multiple WARS which need to interact with database so I am sharing the EntityManagerFactory using Spring Shared contexts. I am having all the Hibernate related configurations at a common place and in every WAR i am specifying  where transactionManager will be shared. Is it rightbr Please clarify my doubts and your comments are valued. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5282 pI have a folder structure for my JS modules. I want one module per page. This is not a single page app.p  pHow can I output files in a folder structurep  pFrom what I can see, the only possibility is to output code[name].jscode. This could work if I make the names very unique, or I could make the names have a codecode for a folder separator. That would mean codeabc.jscode would translate to name codeabccode. I really dont like this. I would like to be able to coderequireabccode.p  pFrom what I can tell, I cant use a single bundled file either because coderequirecode is not available outside of the module. If it was, I could just build a single bundle and coderequireabccode on every page.p  pIf there is a good way to do this that Im not finding on the internet, please let me know.p  pIt looks like Im able to easily do this with require.js using r.js, but I dont want to use require.js and would like CommandJS modules.p

Negative 5282 pMy app offers guitar players a page they can define a song in terms of Name, chords used, and relevant scales.p  pMy app has two spinners that have parts of a fully formed guitar chord, and another spinner for split chords, so three spinners in all.  They are working nicely. p  pIn the Activity, one spinner holds a list of guitar chord primitives i.e. C, and the second spinner holds a list of chord modifiers i.e. maj7.  p  pThen, from each of the spinners, I need to have the two strings combined into a textView or list which will hold something like Gm, A, Cmaj7... which are the users chosen chords for performing the song, and they need to be saved for later use in a performance page.p  pI need to be able to store the combined strings from spinner1 and spinner2 to get Cmaj7.  This algorithm is necessary since the list of chords would number in about 40,000 list items if you did it in just one spinner, so the 2spinner method makes sense, I believe.p  pWhat I want know isp  ol lipHow to get the strings out of the spinners and into a textView or whatever box you might suggest.pli lipHow to combine the strings, which I can probably figure out on my own...pli ol  pIve looked over hundreds of articles here in stackoverflow, and most of them are outdated or irrelevant, and often dont work with current code.

Negative 5282 pstrongTHIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF SORTING BY A PROPERTYstrongp  pAssume I have an array of object instances. Many instances are in the array more than once.p  precodevar array  [   opaqueObjectA,   opaqueObjectB,   opaqueObjectA,   opaqueObjectC,   opaqueObjectB,   opaqueObjectC,   opaqueObjectA, ] codepre  pI dont care about the order, I care that the objects that are the same instance end up next to each other. In other words after sorting, one possible result would bep  precodevar array  [   opaqueObjectB,   opaqueObjectB,   opaqueObjectC,   opaqueObjectC,   opaqueObjectA,   opaqueObjectA,   opaqueObjectA, ] codepre  pI dont care if the As or the Bs or the Cs come first, I only care that objects of the same instance are next to each other after sorting.p  pSo the questions arep  ol lipis JavaScript codesortcode guaranteed to handle this case pli lipIf not how can I do it  The sort function requires me to return 1 if a lt b, 1 of a  b and 0 if a  b but given the objects are opaque, and since I dont have access to pointer values or something else, I have nothing to compare them with to get a less than or greater than result, only an equal result.pli ol  pI can go add some sortId to each opaque object but that seems kind of bad to add properties to objects, Id have no idea if Im cobbering a property. I could make another set of objects, each with an id and a reference to one instance, sort those, then collect their instances into a new array. That also seems rather lame to have to go build an entire array of objects to sort.p  pActually Id also like to be able to sort by multiple instances which is a property but still not comparable. Examplep  precodevar array  [    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffH, ,    thing opaqueThingB, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,    thing opaqueThingC, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,    thing opaqueThingB, stuff opaqueStuffH, ,    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffH, ,    thing opaqueThingC, stuff opaqueStuffG, , ] codepre  pId like to be able to sort them first by thing, then by stuff. So one possible result would bep  precodevar array  [    thing opaqueThingB, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,    thing opaqueThingB, stuff opaqueStuffH, ,    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,   Note the G s     thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,   Are next to    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffH, ,   each other    thing opaqueThingA, stuff opaqueStuffH, ,    thing opaqueThingC, stuff opaqueStuffG, ,    thing opaqueThingC, stuff opaqueStuffG, , ] codepre  pThis would be trivial in CC because I could just compare the addresses of the instances. Is there a way to do this in JavaScript without dirtying the objects with hacked on properties and without making temporary arrays just for sortingp

Negative 5282 pThere are a number of compression protocols that support multiple corethread compressiondecompression.  However, it appears the base decompressioncompression methods all use a single core even though at least of the algorithms support multiple cores.  p  pIf there isnt an existing tool to accomplish this, is there a way to manage it without dropping out to Java or C  p  pI thought that I could use the ability to codepipecode or codeserializecode to get what I wanted by passing the R object out to the shellcommandline somehow.  But, I cant seem to get a usable form of the object out of R that way maybe Im missing something.  The obvious solution would be use codedputcode but the note in the help for that function makes it pretty clear that using codedputcode to turn an R object into ASCII for the sake of saving isnt a suitable or safe purpose for codedputcode.  The alternative mentioned codedumpcode acts like codesavecode Id rather have something like codesaveRDScode, and still routes the file to a code.Internalcode that is impenetrable without digging into Rs C code.p  pWhat other approaches to solve this problem should I considerp

Negative 5282 pJust starting out with Entity Framework Code First and I have to say I am having a lot of problems with it when loading SQL data that is fairly complex.

The easiest thing to do is to create 3 Entities Region, AnimalCategory, and Animal and use LINQ to load the data. p  pBut lets say I am not interested in loading any AnimalCategory information and define an Entity class just to represent AnimalCategory so that I can do the JOIN. How can I do this with Entity Framework Even with many of its Mapping functions I still dont think this is possible. p  pIn non Entity Framework solutions this is easy to accomplish by using INNER JOINs in SPs or inline SQL. So what are my options in Entity Framework Shall I pollute my data model with these useless tables just so I can do a JOINp

Negative 5282 pThe past few days I have been working on a script that I thought would be rather easy but it seems not, and I do understand why. My problem is how to get around it. p  pstrongThe batch script I need explainedstrongp  pI have a script that runs in cmd.exe that does a bunch of things like moving a huge amount of files from a location to another. Lets call it  codemovefile.cmdcode. This script works, but happens to stop sometimes very rarely  lets not go into why and that script. Its important that this script always runs, so my idea here was to create a batch that exits cmd.exe and then reopens the script each hour or so. Lets call this script coderestartcmd.batcode p  pemSounds perfectly easy as I could do thisemp  precodeecho off  loop  start cscriptmovefile.cmd   Timeout nobreak t 3600  Taskkill cmd.exe  goto loop codepre  pBut obviously this doesnt work because my new script also runs in cmd.exe, so it would kill this process as well. p  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrongp  pSo I made a copy of cmd.exe and renamed it into dontkillthis.exe. I run dontkillthis.exe and then open the restardcmd.bat from dontkillthis.exe  this works perfectly But I need to be able to just dobbleclick my script instead of doing that. Why Because its supposed to be as easy as possible and I want my restartcmd.bat to be in my startup folder.p  pIve been looking at the ideas of getting the exact process ID of cmd.exe and shutting that so that my dontkillthis.exe will remain, but I cant seem to nail it.

It finds classes I managed to list all classes in apk and they are there, even cativities can be started, but there must be some kind of problem when creating layouts as it fails there.p  pIf I surround codeonCreatecode with codetry... catchcode, then the scanning activity starts and works, but there are no menus, icons, buttons...p  pI tried creating a .jar in eclipse and then replace the entire project in Unity by it, but it doesnt work either.p  pIm using facebook plugin as well, and it works properly.

It would work, despite of the lot of work, as Im not going to modify anything else in ZXing, but not the best option, and definitively not a general solution to work with plugins.p  pAny help, or documentation in deep unity android plugins stuff is welcome.p  pPS I added sources to unity plugins folder, so I can edit with Eclipse with no need to compile, copy and all that stuff. I cant do that for ZXing as unity creates a bunch of .meta files that makes R generation fail files can be ignored applying patterns in code folders, but R generation is done by a different processor and I was not able to set any filter, so I have to copy the project from eclipse to unity when modified.p
Negative 5282 pSo Im sure this has been answered before but couldnt find anything that really fit.p  pSo essentially currently we have all language data stored in the database, everything from countries, to labels, to product names. We are modernizing our application to use an angularjs front end and Java  jersey Rest backend. The problem is there is so much data in these tables that I dont know if it makes sense to hit the database for every lookup.p  pPreviously I have had projects where you need a list of countries, you call a lookup service it returns the countries and then you cache it client side. Is this the best way to do it In this app there will potentially be up to 100150 different lookups does it make sense to call a service for each one and cache them as you go or does it make more sense to request all of the lookups at once at the beginning of the day lets say and cache them all at oncep  pJust looking for a best practice kind of thing here if all this data needs to be stored in the DB. Essentially the reason it needs to be in the DB is later we will have an admin app that will allow our non technical users the ability to change lookup values like add a new country or whatever.p  pThank you.p

Negative 5282 pI am trying to use codeViewPager.PageTransformercode interface in old Android 2.2 application. My target API is 8 Level. But there is known check in codeViewPagercode compat library class p  precodeif Build.VERSION.SDKINT gt 11          final boolean hasTransformer  transformer  null         final boolean needsPopulate  hasTransformer  mPageTransformer ....      codepre  pSo because of this check codePageTransformercode doesnt work in old Androids even with great codeNineOldAndroidscode library.br I know there are some solutions available, one of them is to change default implementation of codeViewPagercode class. Futhermore, fork of dafault compat library without this check is available on github.br Of course I can use this library or just change it by myself and use my custom codeViewPagercode class.br But in this case a lot of problems appear.br Most important that you cannot use this custom class with other libraries, for instance codeViewPageIndicatorcode, because they have been created for default codeViewPagercode class.br Firstly,what I want to implement  p  pMy idea is to create some library and custom view for my purposes, this custom view will include page indicator, view pager and some other views.    p  pSo user of the library dont have to work with codeViewPagercode directly it will use only custom view and some other classes from the library.  p  pI have different ideas how can I solve this problem.   p  ol lipJust create custom codeViewPagercode , edit classes from other libraries dependent on codeViewPagercode with my custom implementation, just to change type of class member. So just hide all this dirty stuff from user and allow him to use methods for customs view.    pli lipUse reflection. At first, I thought that it is bad idea, because it is quite expensive , I thought so, but than I found the article on official Android Development blog a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.com200904backwardcompatibilityforandroid.html relnofollowAndroid Backward Compatibility a. Here is example how you can use reflection in order backward compat. If to use reflection in this case, I can simply override method and than without calling super, change the part, but it will look really heavy and ugly. But we will have one great advantage, we can use this custom class with everywhere where is default codeViewPagercode is required.pli ol  pMaybe there is another good way to deal with this problem.p  pBut I am really concerned about performance as far as this code should run on old devices, it should be as lightweight as possible.    p  pPlease suggest the best way to follow in this case, just implement library doing whatever I want with default implementation and keep it hidden from users or use reflection and save compatibility with other classes.  p  pI will be grateful for any help and advice.  Thx.p

Negative 5282 pBased on the results I got and the provided documentation I concluded that calibration using nonplanar rig does not work in OpenCV they are heavily dependent on the initial guess. According to their documentation of the function codecalibrateCameracodep  blockquote   pThe algorithm performs the following stepsp      ul   liCompute strongthe initial intrinsic parameters the option only available   for planar calibration patternsstrong or read them from the input   parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to zeros initially   unless some of CVCALIBFIXK are specified. li   liEstimate the initial   camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known.   This is done using solvePnP li   liRun the global LevenbergMarquardt   optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error, that is,   the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points   imagePoints and the projected using the current estimates for camera   parameters and the poses object points objectPoints. See   projectPoints for details.li   ul blockquote  pAlso in mandatory you need to provide initial estimation of intrinsic if you use nonplanar rig as an input, thereby confirming the first point. p  pSo, my question is, is there any any library any language available which has the implementation of finding intrinsics or maybe together with the extrinsics for nonplanar rigp
Negative 5282 pI have been working on implementing UIPageViewController for some time now. I have went through many problems that i managed to solve by myself and with some extra help. Now i am stuck with the last part and that is the UIPageControl.p  pI got two problems that i would like some help withp  pProblem 1 Is there any simple way to resize the dots for the pageControlp  pProblem 2 This is how it is builtp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb794p.png altenter image description herep  pI know it is hard to see but i will explain them starting from the upper left corner and going to right. First VC is simply a Navigation Controller pointing to a UITableViewController.p  pin the second row the first VC is the datasource delegate for the UIPageVIewController. The one next to it is the PageViewController, The two UITableViews next to it is the pages that are in the UIPageViewController. And the last one is the PageContentViewController.p  pSo i added this code in viewDidLoad to the datasource VC meaning the first VC in the second rowp  precodeself.navigationController.delegate  self CGSize navBarSize  self.navigationController.navigationBar.bounds.size CGPoint origin  CGPointMake navBarSize.width2, navBarSize.height2  self.pageControl  [[UIPageControl alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMakeorigin.x, origin.y16,                                                                    0, 0] Here added 45 to Y and it did the trick    self.pageControl.pageIndicatorTintColor  navbarColor self.pageControl.currentPageIndicatorTintColor  [UIColor lightGrayColor]  [self.pageControl setNumberOfPages2] codepre  pand p  precode voidnavigationControllerUINavigationController navigationController     willShowViewControllerUIViewController viewController animatedBOOLanimated     int index  [self.navigationController.viewControllers indexOfObjectviewController]     self.pageControl.currentPage  index   codepre  pWhich gives me this resultp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9qgI2.png altenter image description herep  pWhich is perfect, I can swipe right and left and the PageControl shows the right indicator etc. However when i leave the UIPageViewController meaning when i click back. The PageController still appears in the first VC in the first picture. Why does it tag along and not get removed and how can i solve this p  pIf you need extra codes  pictures that would make it easier to understand just tell me. Thank youp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay so i solved the first problem thanks to the comment of removing it in viewWillDissapear. I used this code in the datasource ViewControllerp  precodevoidviewWillDisappearBOOLanimated     [super viewWillDisappearYES]      [self.pageControl removeFromSuperview]   codepre  pThe PageControl now only shows where it should be BUT there is one problem that i forgot to mention.

Here is how it looks p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaNWCY.png altenter image description herep  pRemoving the code that i used to implement the PageController fixes the problemp  precodeself.navigationController.delegate  self CGSize navBarSize  self.navigationController.navigationBar.bounds.size CGPoint origin  CGPointMake navBarSize.width2, navBarSize.height2  self.pageControl  [[UIPageControl alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMakeorigin.x, origin.y16,                                                                    0, 0] Here added 45 to Y and it did the trick    self.pageControl.pageIndicatorTintColor  navbarColor self.pageControl.currentPageIndicatorTintColor  [UIColor lightGrayColor]  [self.pageControl setNumberOfPages2] codepre

Negative 5282 pI have a very large table on a mysql 5.6.10 instance roughly 480 million rows. The storage engine is InnoDB. Table and DB Default. The table was partitioned by hash of merchantId bigint a kind of client identifier which helped when queries related to a single merchant.  Due to significant performance degradation when queries spanned multiple merchants, I decided to repartition the table by Range on ACTIONDATE the DATE that an activity occurred.  Thinking I was being clever, I decided to add a few 5 new fields for future use unusedvarchar1 varchar200, etc., since the table is so large, adding new fields essentially requires a rebuild anyway, so why not...p  pI created the new table structure as new, dumped the existing file to a secondary server using mysql dump.  I then used an awk script to finesse the name and a few other details to fit the new table  change tableName to tableNamenew, and started the load.p  pThe existing table was approximately 430 GB.  The text file similarly was about 403 GB.  I was surprised therefore that the new table ended up taking about 840 GB  Based on the linux fize size of the .ibd filesp  pSo, I have 2 basic questions, which really amount to why and what now...p  pI imagine that the new table is larger because the dump file was in the order of the previous partition merchantId while the load was inserting into the new partitioning Activity date creating a semirandom insertion order.  The randomness led mysql to leave plenty of space roughly 50 in the pages for future insertions. Im a little fuzzy on the terminology here, having spent much more time in my career with Sql Server DBs than MySql Dbs...  Im not able to find any internal statistics in mysql for space free per page.  The INFORMATIONSCHEMA.TABLES DATAFREE stat is an unconvincing 68MB.p  pIf it helps these are the relevant stats from IS.TABLESp  pTABLETYPE   BASE TABLEbr Engine       InnoDBbr VERSION      10br ROWFORMAT   Compactbr TABLEROWS     488,094,271br AVGROWLENGTH       1,564 DATALENGTH    763,509,358,592 711 GB INDEXLENGTH   100,065,574,912 93.19 GB  DATAFREE        68,157,440 0.06 GBp  pI realize that that doesnt add up to 840 GB, but as I said, that was the size of the .ibd files which seems to be slightly different than the IS.TABLES stats.  Either way, it is significantly more than the text dump file. I digress...  p  pMy question is whether my theory about whether the repartioning explains the roughly doubled size.  Or is there another explanation  I think the extra columns 2 Bigint, 2 Varchar200, 1 Date are not the culprit since they are all null.  My napkin calculation was that the additional columns would add lt 9 GB.  Likewise, one additional index on UID should be a relatively small addition.p  pThe follow up question is what can I do now if I want to try to compact the table.  Server now only has about 385 GB free...

Negative 5282 pI have a web.py program acting as a web service, delivering responses according to the files in its directory.p  pNow I want to build a network of servers, each running an instance of the program. Additionally, each server has a list of addresses to other servers.p  pThe motivation behind this is to allow different servers to store different files, delivering a different part of the now distributed service.p  pSo far so good, each server looks at its own files, does its thing to create the responses and then concatenates to that all responses he gets from his neighbors in the network.p  pThe problem is that this can cause circular requests if two servers have each other on their list directly or indirectly.p  pHow can I prevent this I was thinking about appending a list of server addresses to each request. A server will add itself to the list when receiving the request. It will only request a response from those neighbors that are not on the list already. Is this a feasible approachp  pIs there something built into http requests to collect responses from several servers without creating endless loopsp

What if I wanted to rotate it by an angle that isnt a multiple of 90 degrees I know that It is obviously impossible to get the exact same shape made of 1s, because of the nature of the grid. The idea that comes to mind is converting each value of 1 to a coordinate vector. Then it would amount to rotating the coordinates which should be more simple about a point. One could then write something which would take the coordinates, and compare them to the matrix grid, and if there is a point in the right box, it will be filled. I know Ill also have to find a center around which to rotate.p  pDoes this seem like a reasonable way to do this If anyone has a better idea, Im all ears. I know with a small grid like this, the shape would probably be entirely different, however if I had a large shape represented by 1s, in a large grid, the difference between representations would be smaller.p

Negative 5282 pI just started refactoring my nonframework project into using Slim and Twig to try and make it follow a more modern design pattern.p  pIve come to the conclusion already, that for each route I have on my site, I will have to have a corresponding require with a matching path  or a require that has all possible paths in one I dont know if theres a noticeable difference there aside from the logical separation of code.p  pIt does not make sense in my head to include possibly in my case 80100 routes and try and match them for strongevery single requeststrong when the request could determine where we wanted to go in the first place  assuming we went away from the singlepointofentry philosophy that Slim and so many other frameworks build upon. Is this how its supposed to work or is there something I have misunderstood  I have read numerous tutorials on many different frameworks in attempt to find the right one for my project which in itself was and still is a nightmare, and none of them seem to touch on the subject of Hey  why are we doing this so inefficientlyp  pIs the includerequire operation simply so fast that we should not care, and we just sacrifice this for manageability Excuse my ignorance, but when coming from a project where I only type requireinclude when I actually need something, this seems, well, stupid.

Negative 5282 pSo Im having a bit of an issue when trying to send an email to myself with an attachment. Im not using the standard php mail function, Im using PHPMailer because of convenience. Im running the post through an Ajax call and Ive done extensive research to make sure that it formats correctly. p  pWhat is happening is that when I am submitting my form all the data sends through correctly. Im getting the image name, but nothing else with it. My content type is set correctly, and everything else is set correctly, so Im just confused as to what is going on and could use a little insight. p  pAll my code is sectioned off belowp  pstronghtml formstrong codeindex.phpcodep  precodeltform idrequestArtForm action methodpostgt     ltdiv classrowgt         ltsection classformgroup colsm6 colxs12gt             ltlabel classcontrollabel reqgtNameltlabelgt             ltinput typetext classformcontrol idname datavalidatornotEmptygt         ltsectiongt         ltsection classclearfixgtltsectiongt         ltsection classformgroup colsm6 colxs12gt             ltlabel classcontrollabel reqgtEMail Addressltlabelgt             ltinput typeemail classformcontrol idemailaddress datavalidatornotEmptyisEmail gt         ltsectiongt         ltsection classclearfixgtltsectiongt         ltsection classformgroup colsm6 colxs12gt             ltlabel classcontrollabelgtPhone Numberltlabelgt             ltinput typetel classformcontrol idphone datavalidatorisPhoneNumber gt         ltsectiongt         ltsection classclearfixgtltsectiongt         ltsection classformgroup colsm6 colxs12gt             ltlabel classcontrollabelgtUpload an Imageltlabelgt             ltinput typefile nameimages[] multiplegt         ltsectiongt         ltsection classclearfixgtltsectiongt         ltsection classformgroup colxs12gt             ltlabel classcontrollabel reqgtAdditional Commentsltlabelgt             lttextarea classformcontrol rows5 idcomments datavalidatornotEmptygtlttextareagt         ltsectiongt         ltsection classformgroup colxs12gt             ltbutton typesubmit classbtn btnprimary pullrightgtSend Messageltbuttongt         ltsectiongt     ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pstrongjavascriptstrong codemainscripts.phpcodep  precoderequestArtForm.submitfunctione     e.preventDefault     body.spinlarge     var formData  new FormData     formData.appendcallback, requestDrawing     formData.appendparameters[], requestArtForm name.val     formData.appendparameters[], requestArtForm emailaddress.val     formData.appendparameters[], requestArtForm phone.val     formData.appendparameters[], requestArtForm comments.val     .each[nameimages[]][0].files, functioni, file         formData.appendimages[], file          ifvalidatorthis         .ajax             url  ltAPPBASEgtassetsservercallbacks.php,             type  POST,             data  formData,             dataType  JSON,             contentType  multipartformdata,             processData  false,             success  functiondata                 body.spinfalse                 ifdata.errors                     else                                                else         body.spinfalse       codepre  pstrongPHPstrong codecallbacks.phpcodep  precodeenabledFunctions  array MAIL  new PHPMailer  function enableFunctionfunction     global enabledFunctions     arraypushenabledFunctions, function   function requestDrawingname, emailaddress, phone, comments     global MAIL     response  array      ifemptyname or emptyemailaddress         response[errors]  true         response[message]  Please make sure all the required fields are filled out.

Negative 5282 pOk, Im working on this form, and Im trying to work out my own form validation since the jQuery form validator plugin gives me a headache. Ive pretty much been able to get all the validations I need from the input fields themselves, but right now Im trying to figure out how to keep the form from submitting if someone is ignoring my error messages and somehow has an age of CAT has letters in the numbers field. p  pI think I have an idea of how to do this, strongembut Im trying to figure out how to get the form to check for valid entries on each KEYUP, and see whether or not any given field hasClassiinvalid, which would then disable the submit button.emstrong Ive gotten some of this to work with text input fields, but I dont know how I would do this with checkboxes or radio input fields. That 2nd one is important because it makes up the majority of my form. p  pstrongemAnd then there are my RegExp variables that have suddenly stopped working.emstrong I know theyre supposed to work, because Ive used them already, and I guess Ive added some code somewhere thats stopped them from working now. I havent been able to test all of them, but I know that notLetter and notNumber should work, but dont for some reason. p  phere is my a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpg9mL4ab relnofollowjsFiddleap

Negative 5282 pGiven a temporal graph with a time attribute in every edge I had a script to plot the evolution of the graph using a FruchtermanReingold layout. My script was based on this example a hrefhttpestebanmoro.org201211temporalnetworkswithigraphandrwith20linesofcode relnofollowTemporal Networks with igraph and R with 20 lines of codea.p  pOne of the tricks was to start computing the layout for the current snapshopt codetcode from the layout of the last snapshot codet1code, and then limiting the nodes displacement with codemaxdeltacode so that there is a sense of smooth transitions between snapshots.

Negative 5282 pIve been sitting here for the past 3 hours thinking of and googling about a way to get a rectangle div element moving back and forth with javascript on the press of a button. It was moving, but then I was trying to monitor a collision and it didnt work. It said total trash, so I slimmed the code down to thisp  precodedocument.onkeyup, functione     var SQposition  SQbody.position     var SQleft  SQposition.left     var SQtop  SQposition.top     Go left D or left arrow key     ife.keyCode  68  e.keyCode  39          console.logFired         SQbody.css             left SQleft  10  px,                codepre  pNo matter where I monitor the variable codeSQleftcode, it always fires a 0 then obviously a ten and so on.

Negative 5282 pI have many different matrix classes that represent the different kind of storages that a matrix can use. For example static and dynamic arrays like thisp  precodeclass matd      float arr[3][4]  class mats      float arr  codepre  pAll matrix classes have access operators using codeoperatoruint32 r, uint32 ccode. They will obviously have to be implemented for every class separately. All matrices also have functions that can be applied on them, like codetransposecode which returns a new matrix. This function looks exactly the same for all matrices, since it uses the codeoperatorcode which all matrices have in common. How can I share the function across my matrix classesp  pHeres what I dont want to dop  ul liHave common base class for all matrices with codevirtual .. operatorcode to be used inside the base methods and to be overridden by the different storage matrices. Causes virtual function overheadli liNew matrix class containing all base methods with a template parameter that represents the storage policy used and a member variable of that type. Can only call constructors of storage policy member through constructors of base class overhead when accessing elements, since the access operator has to be called twiceli ul  pI know all information is present at compiletime for the compiler to know which matrix class is used in which case. The only solution that I can think of right now is to define a macro with all base methods and then use that macro in all matrix classes, but that would just be really ugly.p

Negative 5282 pThis is more a best practices questions. Sometimes, Im working on a long term branch and I have to stop it to debug something quick in another branch. In order to do that, I checkout another branch and my project in local and in my remote server changes too thanks to PhpStorm that connects both. I also do a composer.phar update, doctrineschemaupdate and other commands to adapt the project to the new environment. The problem with that isp  p1 I waist time changing branchs and using the commands just to debug something quick and then come back to my long term project.p  p2 The new branch erases new parameters if I had added new ones on the long term branch. I have to remember the values I chose and so on.p  p3 My database is updated and if I had filled it on the long term branch I loose the content.p  pThe third point is easier to solve. I just have to create another database for the new branch. However, I think I can improve all these steps. Maybe having another folder for the new branche. But how would I do with git that points to only one folder I would like to know how other developers do that in their everyday work to be more efficient.p  pObs I work on a Symfony project. p
Negative 5282 pI apologise if this is a daft question. Im currently writing against a Django API which I also maintain and wish under certain circumstances to be able to generate multiple partial responses in the case where a single request yields a large number of objects, rather than sending the entire JSON structure as a single response.p  pIs there a technique to do this It needs to follow a standard such that client systems using different request libraries would be able to make use of the functionality.p  pThe issue is that the client system, at the point of asking, does not know the number of objects that will be present in the response.p  pIf this is not possible, then I will have to chain requests on the client end  for example, getting the first 20 objects amp if the response suggests there will be more, requesting the next 20 etc. This approach is an OK workaround, but any subsequent requests rely on the previous response. Id rather ask once and have some kind of multipart response.p

Negative 5282 pIm updating my Android app. The app retrieves data from my server and among that data is a user id. The user id is a number Integer but it arrives from the server as a string eg 1234. In the old version I then saved this user id as a string in my shared prefernces but now that Im looking back at it I dont like this and want to save it as an Integer as it should be.p  pSo far pretty simple. I just use putInt  getInt rather than putString  getString. The problem is that all the people currently using the app will have the value saved in their shared preferences as a string and then when they update the app the new version of the app will start to try to use getInt to get the value which the old version saved as a string.p  pWhats the best way to avoid any errors because of this and ensure a smoothe transition between the two app versionsp  pThanks.p
