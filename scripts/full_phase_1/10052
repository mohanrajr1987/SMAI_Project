Positive 10052 pI have a Pandas DataFrame that contains duplicate entries. Some items are also listed twice or three times. I would like to filter it so that it only shows items that are listed at least n times. In the final table all items should only be shown once. The DataFrame contains 3 columns [colA, colB, colC]. It should only consider colB in determining whether the item is listed multiple times. Note this is not dropduplicates. Its the opposite, I would like to drop items that are in the dataframe less than n times.p

To keep the unit tests flexible, I used a Spring XML file to keep my test data in. Also, instead of creating instances of components to be tested, I retrieved them from my Spring Application context. The XML files which harbored data quickly got out of hand creating object graphs in XML turned out to be a nightmare. Since the components to be tested were picked from the Spring Application Context, each test run loaded emallem the components involved in my application, the DAO objects used etc. Also, as opposed to the concept of unit test cases being centralized or concentrated on testing only the component, my unit tests started hitting databases, communicating with mail servers etc. Bad, really bad.p  pI knew what I had done wrong and started to think of ways to rectify it. Following an advice from one of the posts on this board, I looked up Mockito, the Java mocking framework so that I could do away with using real DAO classes and mail servers and just mock the functionality.p  pWith unit tests a bit under control, this brings me to my second problem the dependence on data. The web services which I have been developing have very little logic but heavy reliance on data. As an example, consider one of my componentsp  precodepublic class PaymentScheduleRetrievalComponent implements Command    public boolean executeContext ctx      Policy policy  Policyctx.getPOLICY     ListltPaymentSchedulegt list  billingDAO.getPaymentStatementForPolicypolicy     ctx.putPAYMENTSCHEDULELIST, list     return false     codepre  pA majority of my components follow the same route  pick a domain object from the context, hit the DAO [we are using iBatis as the SQL mapper here] and retrieve the result.p  pSo, now the questionsbr   How are DAO classes tested esp when a single insertion or updation might leave the database in a unstable state [in cases where lets say 3 insertions into different tables actually form a single transaction]br   What is the defacto standard for functional testing web services which move around a lot of data i.e. mindless insertionsretrievals from the data store  p  pYour personal experiencescomments would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know in case Ive missed out some details on my part in explaining the problem at hand.p  psasukep

Negative 10052 pScenariop  pI have a Distributedobjectsbased IPC between a mac application and a launchd daemon written with Foundation classes. Since I had issues before regarding asynchronous messaging e.g. I have a registerClient on the servers root object and whenever theres an event the servers root object notifies  calls a method in the clients proxy object, I did longpolling which meant that the client harvests lists of events  notifications from the daemon. This harvest is done through a server object method call, which then returns an NSArray instance.p  pIt works pretty well, until for a few seconds, the server objects process launched thru launchd starts being labeled red with the Not responding tag beside it inside Activity Monitor. Like I said, functionally, it works well, but we just want to get rid of this Not responding label. p  pstrongHow can I prevent this Not responding tagstrong p  pFYI, I already did launchdbased processes before and this is the first time I did longpolling. Also, I tried NSSocketPortNameServerbased connections and also NSSocketPortbased ones. They didnt have this problem. Locking wasnt also an issue coz the locks used were only NSConditions and we logged and debugged the program and it seems like the only locking issue is on the harvesting part, which actually, functionally works. Also, clientprocess is written in PyObjC while server process was written using ObjC.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 10052 pI have created a gridview with a column of checkboxes.

Negative 10052 pI have ran into a curious problem. An algorithm I am working on consists of lots of computations like thisp  precodeq  x0y0z0  x1y1z1  ... codepre  pwhere the length of summation is between 4 and 7.p  pThe original computations are all done using 64bit precision. For experimentation, I tried using 32bit precision for x,y,z input values so that computations are performed using 32bit, and storing final result as 64bit value straightforward cast.p  pI expected 32bit performance to be better cache size, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSIMD relnofollowSIMDa size, etc., but to my surprise there was no difference in performance, maybe even decrease.p  pThe architecture in question is Intel 64, Linux, and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGNUCompilerCollection relnofollowGCCa. Both codes do seem to use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStreamingSIMDExtensions relnofollowSSEa and arrays in both cases are aligned to 16 byte boundary.p  pWhy would it be so My guess so far is that 32bit precision can use SSE only on the first four elements, with the rest being done serially compounded by cast overhead.p

Negative 10052 pI thought the CC vs CJava performance question was well trodden, meaning that Id read enough evidence to suggest that the VM languages are not necessarily any slower than the closetosilicon languages. Mostly because the JIT compiler can do optimizations that the statically compiled languages cannot.p  pHowever, I recently received a CV from a guy who claims that Javabased high frequency trading  is always beaten by C, and that hed been in a situation where this was the case.p  pA quick browse on job sites indeed shows that HFT applicants need knowledge of C, and a look at a hrefhttpwww.wilmott.comWilmotta forum shows all the practitioners talking about C.p  pIs there any particular reason why this is the case I would have thought that with modern financial business being somewhat complex, a VM language with type safety, managed memory, and  a rich library would be preferred. Productivity is higher that way. Plus, JIT compilers are getting better and better. They can do optimizations as the program is running, so youd think theys use that runtime info to beat the performance of the unmanaged program. p  pstrongPerhaps these guys are writing the critical bits in C and and calling them from a managed environment PInvoke etc Is that possiblestrongp  pstrongFinally, does anyone have experience with the central question in this, which is why in this domain unmanaged code is without doubt preferred over managedstrongp  pAs far as I can tell, the HFT guys need to react as fast as possible to incoming market data, but this is not necessarily a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRealtimecomputinghard realtimea requirement. Youre worse off if youre slow, thats for sure, but you dont need to guarantee a certain speed on each response, you just need a fast average.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pRight, a couple of good answers thus far, but pretty general welltrodden ground. Let me specify what kind of program HFT guys would be running.p  pThe main criterion is responsiveness. When an order hits the market, you want to be the first to be able to react to it. If youre late, someone else might take it before you, but each firm has a slightly different strategy, so you might be OK if one iteration is a bit slow.p  pThe program runs all day long, with almost no user intervention. Whatever function is handling each new piece of market data is run dozens even hundreds of times a second.p  pThese firms generally have no limit as to how expensive the hardware is.p
Negative 10052 pA while back, I wrote my own settings provider because I was having problems persisting settings in a class library.

Negative 10052 pIm trying to determine when a rerun of XeLaTeX is required because of undefined references. Ive posted a related question on the a hrefhttpscons.tigris.orgdsviewMessage.dodsForumId1272ampdsMessageId2632081 relnofollowSCons mailing lista, and the problem  is as followsp  pPage counts and other references that require multiple runs of XeLaTeX are sometimes not at present detected by SCons and other build systems. Heres an example file which well call codejob.texcodep  precodedocumentclass[oneside,12pt]memoir usepackagexltxtra usepackage[T1]fontenc makepagestyleplain makeoddfootplainPage thepage of arabiclastpage makeevenfootplainPage thepage of arabiclastpage begindocument pagestyleplain Page 1 newpage Page 2 newpage Page 3 newpage enddocument codepre  pIf you run codexelatex jobcode, the .pdf thats produced has page numbers Page 1 of 0, Page 2 of 0, and Page 3 of 0 for the three pages. If you run codexelatex jobcode a second time you get Page 1 of 3, etc. i.e. the correct page count.p  pTo fix this, Ive suggested on the SCons mailing list that the check for whether to run xelatex to resolve undefined references is to change the following regular expression in codeSCons.Tools.texcode at line 71 of version 2.0.1.beta.20100627.r5064p  precode warningrerunstr  LaTeX Warning.RerunPackage w Warning.Rerun  warningrerunstr  LaTeX Warning.RerunPackage w Warning.Rerun                      No file w.w3. codepre  pIn practice, this is a check for No file job.aux. It turns out this works in all cases because XeLaTeX will always print No file job.aux on the first run, and therefore XeLaTeX always runs twice. In effect, this is the same as having codejob.auxcode become an interim build target between codejob.texcode and codejob.pdfcode.p  pTherein lies the problem Even if there is no undefined reference e.g. remove the codearabiclastpagecode from codejob.texcode above XeLaTeX is called twice, once to produce the code.auxcode, once to produce the code.pdfcode. Obviously, if there are no undefined references, this second call is superfluous.p  pThus my question how can one detect  presumably by way of a regular expression testing against the codejob.logcode  when there are or are not undefined references e.g. arabiclastpage that require recompilation.p  pThank you for reading.p  pBest regards,p  pBrianp

Negative 10052 pGood afternoon peoplesp  pI have built a jquery plugin that I use on my site. The plugin is for suggestive input boxes and works fine.p  pOne thing I need to add to it is the ability to pass a function in its config to apply to the response of the ajax call that is made for the suggestive. I cant find anything on trusty old google about how to pass functions and have them applied in the scope of the plugin..p  pI need this because some responses update one field and some update 2 or more fields with different text held in the reponse and I dont want to keep duplicating the plugin allowing for this to happen. I am assuming that the javascript method apply is what I need to look at but I am totally confusedp  pDoes this even make sense on what I am trying to do  and if so can anyone help or point me in the right direction.p  pThanks in advancep  pAlexp

Negative 10052 pI have an ObservableCollection, which holds a codePersoncode object. I have a search feature in my application, and would like to display the most relevant results at the top.

If I search for codePetecode, then it should first display codePetecode, then codePetercode then codePeter Smithcode etc.. It doesnt have to be too complicated as it will only be dealing with a couple thousand max results. My naive approach was to first do codes.Name  querycode, display that item if any, then perform the codes.Name.Containsquerycode, remove the matched item and append it to the previous matched result. However, this seems a bit all over the place and so is there a better way thanks ps  only the name will be used in searching, and I cant use SQL methodsp

Negative 10052 pWhile working on a large project I realized I was making a lot of calls to be scheduled in the future.

Negative 10052 pIs it possible to control build event batch file behaviour depending on whether the build is run from the IDE or the command line.p  pWe have several versions of our product. It contains COM objects that need to be registered. This COM registration is done by a batch file called from a custom build step in the respective project.p  pThe problem is that if a developer runs an automated build for one version from the command line in the background while working on another version in the IDE the automated build will register the COM objects from the version not being worked on in the IDE.p  pSo, is there a way to control whether the registration takes place depending on if the build is done in the IDE or from the command line using devenvp  pThanks.p

Negative 10052 pSo basically Im making an MMO server in C that runs on linux. It works fine at first, but after maybe 40 seconds with 50 clients it will completely pause. When I debug it I find that basically the last frame its on before it stops responding is syscall at which point it disappears into the kernel. Once it disappears into the kernel it never even returns a value... its completely baffling. p  pThe 50 clients are each sending 23 bytes every 250 milliseconds. These 23 bytes are then broadcasted to all the other 49 clients. This process begins to slow down and then eventually comes to a complete halt where the kernel never returns from a syscall for the send command. What are some possible reasons here This is truly driving me nuts  p  pOne option I found is Nagles algorithm which forces delays. Ive tried toggling it but it still happens however.p  pEdit The program is stuck here.

Negative 10052 pI think Ive stumbled upon a bug in the .NET or the native windows API concerning combo boxes. p  pIll give a specific scenariop  pI have two database tables, with a one to many relation ship between the two, a brief description is as followsp  precodeTable FinSage Column     Type SageCode   nvarchar10 PK Desc       nvarchar100  Table FinCode  Column     Type  FinCode    nvarchar10 PK  Desc       nvarchar100  SageCode   nvarchar10 FK codepre  pThese are entirely user maintained, with only the PK obviously being constrained to be unique. When creating or editing a record on the FinCode table I have a combobox on the screen which has the display member bound to the Desc column and the value member bound to SageCode.p  pThe problem arises when there are duplicate entries in the Desc column, which is quite common under the expected use of the system. It seems the .net combo boxes does a reverse lookup using the display value to get the value member. So when the combo box gains focus it will change the value to the first occurrence of the display member. p  pI understand that in theory, if there are duplicates in the display value then the combo box effectively has no use as the user doesnt know which value they have selected. However as we know users are not perfect and so they will and do enter the same descriptive value for a code. p  pI currently get around this by combining the code and the description, however my boss wants them to be able to edit this value by using either the code or the description as some uses prefer to use one or the other. I tried using two combo boxes bound to the same binding source but saw this problem arise. p  pApologies for the verbose description, its not really a problem that can be summed up in code. p  pOn a slightly related note, the combo boxes that Access use dont have this bug. But I believe Access is comparable to WPF in that it draws all its own UI components rather than using the Win32 API. p  pIs there not a way of forcing a native combo box to find the correct item in the list based on the associated value or was the concept of valuedescription pair developed after Microsoft designed their native combo box p  pThank you for any insightsp  pMarlonp  pcodeeditcode br The answer below prompted me to quickly dev up a test application and Im not getting the same behaviour unless the combobox is inside a datagridview which is unrelated to the original question.p  pSorry Microsoft, I would delete this question but I cant now, ah well, mistakes are good. p

Negative 10052 pIm thinking of login forms in particularp  pBy their nature, login forms block action on arbitrary input  without a valid username and password, you just get bounced. Is there a reason why these even need the addition of codeauthenticitytokencode or similar crosssite request forgery protection at allp  pIm curious if login forms are one example where CSRF might even be generally undesirablep  pGiven an anonymous client, it should be allowed that the first point of contact with a site is to POST valid login credentials. CSRF prevents this direct interaction by first requiring that the client perform a GET to establish an anonymous session cookie, which is used as the basis for their authenticitytoken. The token must then be posted back with the login credentials. The extra upfront step seems pointless when the actual goal here is to authenticate a user who arrives without a session and is trying to give their credentials.p  pAm I missing some security consideration in this scenariop

For the example above, EXPIRATION being 10 seconds, Id like to see the inserted object evicted in 10 seconds after last access. That is not happening now  the map must be used somehow to start the eviction. If the map is completely unused, the object can stay there for years.p
Negative 10052 pIm using an .ashx handler to securely download files to a client. On a certain webform page I have a link that points to my .ashx file which takes  query string. In a particular instance it is encrypting a a number 148 to this  .....ashxq035EeD5BQ8. p  pThe debugger interperets this as .....ashxq035EeD5BQ83d, and the string I assign this value to converts code3dcode back to an equal sign but removes the  sign and replaces it with a blank. So essentially my decrypting method complains that the input strings length isnt long enough, because of the  sign being converted to white space. p  pWhy would it do this Is there a simple method that I can encryptdecrypt a query string It doesnt need to be bank vault security, but I would like to do something.p

I THINK this is safe the ones Ive pasted is all the code Im using with eval, but I may have missed a point, so a professionals opinion is important for me. I know why they say eval is dangerous, as it is capable for interpreting any code, malicious or not, but here, I think this way cannot be compromised at all, as the response from the server is completely under my control. Another option would be making ANOTHER ajax call for the variables and load them directly without ajax from the returned array, but thay would sum to two calls, I already make the load call anyway as it really loads some HTML content from the server but this way, even though a bit hacky putting variables into a hidden HTML tag, seems convenient and ASP.NET also does this for viewstate too after all.p  pMy focus is on eval anyway, is this perfectly safe, or should I have some security considerations Javascript experts please.p

So when I start program A from the command shell, it fails because it doesnt run as admin. If I use the runas command to run it as admin, or if I set As properties to always run as admin, when it starts it doesnt start in the environment created by B, so it doesnt get the PATH and other environment vars.

Negative 10052 pMy problem is ComboBox, with the text of the first item longer than the combo  I dont see the text from the start, I see the end of the text. I wanna see text from the start. Ive tried SelectionStart property set to 0, but it has nothing to do with my problem  it only sets where from text is selected.p  pLonger explanationp  pI have several combo boxes on my form, which I have to adjust theirs drop down list width to be suitable for the longest item. So, when I open drop down list, its width is long as the longest item is. But, there is a problem  I have a special function, which goes through list of combo boxes and made theirs drop down width long as the longest itemp  precodePublic Sub MakeDropDownListWider     Dim conKontrola As ComboBox     conKontrola  Me      make the dropdown wider so the entire selection can be seen     If conKontrola.Items.Count gt 0 Then         Dim pixlength As Graphics  Graphics.FromHwndNew IntPtr         Dim lengthHolding As Int32         Dim stringWidth As Int32         Dim g As Graphics  conKontrola.CreateGraphics          For Each myItem As Object In conKontrola.Items              If myItem.GetType.ToString  System.Data.DataRowView Then                 lengthHolding  pixlength.MeasureStringmyItem.Row.ItemconKontrola.DisplayMember.ToString, conKontrola.Font.ToSize.Width             Else                 lengthHolding  g.MeasureStringmyItem, conKontrola.Font.Width  15             End If              If lengthHolding gt stringWidth Then                 stringWidth  lengthHolding             End If         Next           Dim allowedWidth As Int32  0         If Me.Parent.Width gt 0 Then                             allowedWidth  Me.Parent.Width  conKontrola.Location.X  10         End If         If allowedWidth gt 0 And stringWidth  15 gt allowedWidth Then             conKontrola.DropDownWidth  allowedWidth         Else             conKontrola.DropDownWidth  stringWidth  15 add 15 for the scrollbar         End If      End If End Sub codepre  pWhen I run this function on every combo box of my form, all of my combo boxes are selected after the form is shown. I call this method on forms shown event. I didnt wanted combo boxes to be selected, so I used SelectionStart property of combo box, like thisp  precodemyComboBox1.SelectionStart  myComboBox1.Text.Length codepre  pThat way, none of the combo boxes appears to be selected. But, another problem has arised I see only end of the selection on my combo boxes. If the first item is short, then everything is cool. But, if the first item is longer than the combo box, I see only the end of the item  but, I must the item from the start.p  pSo, f.e. my first item is C is a very good programming language designed by Anders Hejlsberg and my combo is shorter than the text, I will see only designed by Anders Hejlsberg.  I wanna see C is a very good programming.p  pI cant move the SelectionStart property to 0, because all of my combo boxes gets selected again. And even if I do that, I still see end of the first item, not the start  the only difference is that item is selected.p  pAny idea how to see the text of the first item from the startp

As I mentioned above, I have created a new column and store the whole name in English characters and make the search from there as well.

Negative 10052 pIm trying to implement my own triplestore ontop of a SQL database yes I know there are finished projects out there and Im trying to decide on the best way to implement a symbolic atom.p  pIn a naive design, we might implement a triplestore in SQL by creating a single triple table with three varchar columns called subject, predicate, object. To save space I was going to create an atom table, that would store the unique text used in any subjectpredicateobject field, and change those fields to foreign keys linking back to the atoms that contain their text.p  pHowever, I see a couple ways to implement the Atom table.p  ol lipStore the text as a varchar.p  ul liPros Simple to index and enforce uniqueness of the text.li liCons It could not store arbitrarily large text.li ulli lipStore the text as a text blob, as well as a hash of the text to use when querying and enforcing uniqueness.p  ul liPros Could store arbitrarily large text.li liCons A little more complicated. Possibly, albeit rare, hash collisions depending on the hashing algorithm md5, sha, etc.li ulli ol  pWhich is the better approach in terms of performance, longterm reliability, and ability to store any type of data If I use a hash, is there a valid concern about collisions Even if collisions are rare, it would only have to happen once to corrupt triplestore.p

Negative 10052 pWe are working on a new application that uses C, WPF4, Prism4 and MEF.  The application comprises a main shell window which defines a grid with some splitters and five regions, and a number of separate modules that contribute UI functionality in to the various regions through view discovery and view injection.  All standard stuff, nothing exotic.  The application is very basic and everything works fine, i.e. the modules correctly contribute their views in to the shells regions at run time.p  pWe also have a requirement to host the same shell and UI from the contributing modules in to a large legacy MFC application we have.  Heres where were having problems.  The WPFMFC interop code using HwndSource seems to be working fine, as evidenced by the fact that the shell gets displayed correctly as a child of the parent MFC CView and has basic functionality like a grid splitter that is defined in the shell itself.  However, none of the regions in the shell are being populated with views defined in the Prism modules.  Debugging shows that the modules are indeed being loaded, however, the IRegionManager instance that gets injected in to each module contains zero regions for the module to add its views in to.  Its as if Prism is not aware that the shell defines any regions at all, consequently, attempts to add views in to these nonexistent regions fail.p  pWe derived a new custom bootstrapper class that our MFC code calls the Run method on.  This bootstrapper class is identical to its equivalent in the standalone application which works fine, the only difference is that we no longer override the InitializeShell method, we just rely on the base class implementation.  Typically this method is overridden to set the Application.Current.MainWindow to the shell and then show the shell, however, in our case there is no current application because were hosted inside an MFC app.  Various attempts at overriding the Bootstrappers run functionality to yield control back to the MFC app to display the shell at the appropriate time have failed failed in the sense that the shells regions are still unpopulated, but the shell still displays.p  pHas anybody successfully used Prism 4 specifically, got shell regions populated within an MFC application  Any advice on how to host a Prismenabled shell with regions in an MFC CView and have the MFC application initiate the bootstrapping process would be appreciated.  Thanks.p

Negative 10052 pI have a solution that contains a website project and several projects that hold support classes. Each project serves a separate basic function Configuration, Data, Identity, Business Objects, etc. When I open the solution in VS2008, it builds perfectly. It operates, runs, debugs, and experiences no compile or JIT exceptions.p  pAfter generated an automated build definition in TFS 2010, the build runs and compiles all of the subprojects in order. They are all targeted to DebugMixed Platforms because the documentation I read trying to trace down my error indicates that this is necessary for website projects. I can see in the build log where all of the freshly compiled libraries and all of the third party libraries are copied both to the codeBinariescode directory and to the websites codebincode directory.

When the line of code is commented out, the error changes, but it is just another not possible error that happens further on down the build chain.p  pWe have other website projects successfully automatically building and deploying from this build agent in all frameworks 2.0. When I change various properties of the build definition workspace, et al or adjust the configuration of the build within the solution itself it produces no change in behavior. When the build is complete, all successfully built projects end up in the build folder. Additionally, this solution has a second less complex website project within it that successfully builds and ends up in the PublishedWebsites folder of the build folder.p
Negative 10052 pI have a query that looks like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.AId  B.AId WHERE A.ADate BETWEEN Start and End      or B.BDate BETWEEN Start and End codepre  pBoth tables A and B are about the same size and have a lot of rows.  Execution plan shows a index seek, but looks like it is scanning the entire index.p  pIf I change the codeorcode to codeandcode then the query is very fast.  I think this is due to the fact that the result of the codeorcode cannot be known without performing a table scan on both tables to compute the codeorcode.  The codeandcode is easily split into two operations.p  pI have read some people stating that it is possible to use codeUNIONcode in place of codeorcode, but this would potentially introduce duplicate rows in the case that both conditions in the OR are true.p  pWhat solution is there so that I can reduce the size of join and prevent a full join of both tables I am open to restructuring the query however possible to make this work, but need the logic of the querygive me items where either the date in a matches the range or the date in B matches the range to remain the same.p

Negative 10052 pI have a simple table with about 8 columns and a LOT of rows in a SQLite database. There is a single program that runs as a service and performs selects, updates and inserts on the table quite often approximately every 5 minutes. The selects are used only to determine which rows are to be updated, and they are based on a column that holds boolean values probably translated to integer internally by SQLite.p  pThere is also a web application that performs selects always with a GROUP BY clause whenever a web user wishes to view part of the data. p  pThere are two ways to ask for data through the web application a predefined filters i.e. the where clause has specific conditions on 3 specific columns an b custom filters i.e. the user chooses the values for the conditions, but the columns participating in the where clause are the same as in a. As mentioned, in both cases there is a GROUP BY operation.p  pI am wondering whether using a view or a custom function might increase the performance. Currently, a custom select may take more than 30 seconds to complete  and thats before any data has been sent back to the user.p  pEDIT Using EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN on a predefined select statement yields only one rowp  precode00TABLE mytable codepre  pUsing EXPLAIN on the same query, yields the followingp  precode0OpenVirtual14keyinfo2,BINARY,BINARY 1OpenVirtual23keyinfo1,BINARY 2MemInt05 3MemInt04 4Goto027 5MemInt15 6Return00 7IfMemPos49 8Return00 9AggFinal00count0 10AggFinal21sum1 11MemLoad00 12MemLoad10 13MemLoad20 14MakeRecord30 15MemLoad00 16MemLoad10 17Sequence10 18Pull30 19MakeRecord40 20IdxInsert10 21Return00 22MemNull10 23MemNull30 24MemNull00 25MemNull20 26Return00 27Gosub022 28Goto082 29Integer00 30OpenRead02 31SetNumColumns09 32Rewind048 33Column08 34String800123456789 35Le35639collseqBINARY 36Column03 37Integer1800 38Gt10042collseqBINARY 39Column07 40Integer10 41Ne35647collseqBINARY 42Column06 43Sequence20 44Column03 45MakeRecord30 46IdxInsert20 47Next033 48Close00 49Sort269 50Column20 51MemStore70 52MemLoad60 53Eq51258collseqBINARY 54MemMove67 55Gosub07 56IfMemPos569 57Gosub022 58AggStep00count0 59Column22 60Integer300 61Add00 62ToReal00 63AggStep21sum1 64Column20 65MemStore11 66MemInt14 67Next250 68Gosub07 69OpenPseudo30 70SetNumColumns33 71Sort180 72Integer10 73Column13 74Insert30 75Column30 76Column31 77Column32 78Callback30 79Next172 80Close30 81Halt00 82Transaction00 83VerifyCookie01 84Goto029 85Noop00 codepre  pThe select I used was as the followingp  precodeSELECT      COUNT as number,      field1,      SUMCASTfilter2 30 AS float as column2  FROM      mytable  WHERE      filter1 gt 123456789  AND filter2 gt 180      OR filter31  GROUP BY      field1  ORDER BY      number DESC, field1 codepre

Negative 10052 pI am creating a web front end for clients to download their reports.  The program that the company uses is written in Java and consists of 31 mysql tables with the 4 reports needed having over 140 points of data each.

I figured on using a TCP clientserver going from Java to PHP but how do I code it so that it doesnt have to be written to the server drive and be supplied as a link.  I also have no wish to rewrite 17,000 lines of Java to PHP as I am new to PHP.  Is there anyway to get this done Thank you in advance.p

Negative 10052 pAt this moment, all of our reports are currently written in stored procedures.  We want to start moving this away from a SQL platform and rather to focus most of the logic in .NET code.  Reasons include the use of our ORM entities, ease of debugging, parallel processing, more unification with business logic, etc.p  pThe problem we face is that by moving our report logic into .NET code, we cannot deploy support fixes as easily as running a script on our production environment.  Releasing binaries means that the whole business has to stop using our application, which is almost impossible during office hours.p  pOne solution is to separate each report into a new project and release just that DLL.

Isnt this very prone to errorsp  pIn many other cases you can type variants, e.g. codebonfcode or codebonferronicode, codefacode or codefactorcode, and so on. But here codepooled.sdcode is completely ignored although pooled sd is actually intended. Ok, if you thoroughly read the headline of the output you can guess that codepooled.sdcode wasnt recognized as it still says t tests with pooled SD but what if I dont even print this, e.g. when piping the output to a selfwritten function There are chances that this error will never be recognized.p  pShould I write to some developers of R, that in future releases of R both spelling variants should be validp

Negative 10052 pGiven a bunch of integers, I want to convert them to base n and for each bit, add the bits up and mod them by n. p  pExample Let n  3, and suppose I want to add the bits mod 3 in 4, 4, 4, 2. These numbers in base 3 is 11, 11, 11, 02. The least significant bit adds up to 1  1  1  2  5  2 mod 3. The second least significant bit adds up to 1  1  1  0  3  0 mod 3. The answer is then 02 base 3  2. Alternatively, if we didnt convert to base 3 before the addition, and just did it in binary, we have 100, 100, 100, 010. The resulting bits from least significant to most significant is 0  0  0  0  0 mod 3, 0  0  0  1  1 mod 3, 1  1  1  0  0 mod 3, so the answer is 010  2.p  pThe case where n  2 is pretty easy, you can just XOR everything. Is there a way to generalize thisp

Negative 10052 pMy goal is to develop a crossplattform based application in C and OpenGL.p  pSince I am using a Macbook Pro, its natural IDE is Xcode, so I would like to use it. Ive successfully compiled pure C code in Xcode, by using the Command Line tool as a template for the projects.p  pMy question is how can I compile OpenGL code without messing with Cocoa and ObjectiveC. The main reason behind this is that since I want to deploy crossplattform applications, I want to stick to C as much as possible.p  pWhile this is true, It wouldnt be that much of a problem if I necessary had to use a little of ObjectiveC and Cocoa. But I would like to get my main project code in C and the less possible amount of ObjectiveCCocoa, understanding by main project code the code specific to my application, such as my classes, objects, and stuff related to the aim of the application, ie. , the main body of the code.p  pIf using COpenGL without messing with ObjCCocoa is not worth in terms of complexity, then the question could be reformulated as simply what is the way to compile simple OpenGL code in Xcodep

To the best of our knowledge no pun intended we are properly allocating and releasing objects in the performSync process.p  pThe question is I am running this process in the background, if I am creating an AutoreleasePool for it, and releasing it at the end of the background process, shouldnt it dealloc everything related to the background process when it is over  I dont have a good understanding of why all of the allocated objects arent getting destroyed.p

Negative 10052 pI have been reading up on memory management and have come across a situation in a project where the book, nor Google has come up with an exact answer. I already know that delegates are manages objects and events are delegate instances. Having said that, delegate instances will be removed from memory once the application ends.p  pWhat I cant figure out is how to ensure that external code has freed up all event references by the time my class is disposed either explicitly or by the GC. As an example, class codeAcode exposes an event and class codeBcode consumes it. Class codeBcode calls Dispose on class codeAcode without freeing up references to the delegates. Of course, we cannot throw an error from the Dispose method itself.p  pFollowing is a class with a delegate and another one that consumes it.p  precodepublic class ClassB      private ClassA A  get set       public ClassB              this.A  new ClassA         this.A.OnProcessed  new ClassA.DelegateProcessedthis.ClassAProcessed           public void Process              this.A.Process           public void ClassAProcessed ClassA sender, EventArgs e               Do something.           Code written by another developer does not free up events before calling Dispose.          this.A.Dispose         this.A  null        public class ClassA IDisposable      public delegate void DelegateProcessed A sender, EventArgs e     public event DelegateProcessed OnProcessed  null      ClassA  this.Disposefalse       public void Dispose               this.Disposetrue         System.GC.SuppressFinalizethis           private void Dispose bool disposing              if this.Disposed                      if disposing                               Dispose managed resources here.                  Is it possible  advisable to dispose of delegates  events here                  Will this adversely affect the consumer class                 this.OnProcessed  new ClassA.DelegateProcessedthis.ClassAProcessed                               this.Disposed  true           public void Process   this.OnProcessedthis, new EventArgs       public void ClassAProcessed ClassA sender, EventArgs e    codepre  pThe point is to ensure that ClassA qualifies for garbage collection no matter what the developer does with ClassB. The point is to minimize the amount of time ClassA spends in memory even if the consumer is careless.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong It is clear from the answers that the events do not have to be explicitly removed from ClassA. As for the main question, weak references seem to be the way to go as answered below. The objective is to minimize the time ClassA stays in memory. Please let me know in case I have overlooked anythig.p

How does it do this For example, does it start with one module and combine all related include files and source files into one large piece of code to analyze  How deep does it search in order to understand the program flow p  pIn a second related question, I have a use case where it is beneficial for me to lint one C module from the codebase at a time instead of providing every C module in a long list to PCLint.  However, if I only provide one C module, will it automatically find the other C modules which it depends on, and use those to understand the program flow of the specified C modulep

Negative 10052 pBackgroundp  pI am programming an a hrefhttpwww.atmel.comdevicesatmega328.aspx relnofollowATmega328a. I cant stand the Arduino IDE, so I prefer using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXcode relnofollowXcodea for writing code. However, I have found all of the options available online for using Xcode to actually upload sketches to Arduino to be convoluted at best and have not been successful in trying to implement them.p  pCurrent Methodp  pWhat currently works well for me is to use Xcode strictly as a debugger, and creating stripped down versions of Arduino classes when I need them so the debugger doesnt freak out when I put in lines of code specific to Arduino. For example, I have a Serial class in my Xcode project which has the following functions, which work just finep  precodevoid Serialprintint myInt      cout ltlt myInt   void Serialprintlnint myInt      cout ltlt myInt ltlt endl  codepre  pI do the same for strings, and whatever other standard a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiC relnofollowCa datatype I may need to print.p  pThis way, any time I want to put codeSerial.printcode within a function in another class Im working on, I can debug strictly from within Xcode without opening the Arduino IDE. I can also create a fake class for codepinModecode, etc.p  pIssuep  pI would like to do this with the codebytecode datatype used in the Arduino environment. I am taking an objectoriented approach to this program, and it threatens to eat up the precious RAM on my little Arduino. So, in order to save space, Im converting all my codeintcodes to codebytecodes and so forth.p  pBut, I assume and my compiler tells me that I cant subclass codecharcode, or codeintcode, or any other basic types. I dont see how I can start using statements like codebyte a  2code or something similar with my current somewhat convoluted workaround method.p  pEssentially, I want to trick Xcode into thinking codebytecode is the same thing as codeintcode for all intents and purposes.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 10052 pAssume that I have a main table which has 100 columns referencing as foreign keys to some 100 tables containing primary keys.p  pThe whole pack of information requires joining those 100 tables. And it is definitely a performance issue to join such a number of tables. Hopefully, we can expect that any user would like to request a bunch of data containing values from not more than some 57 tables out of those 100 in queries that put conditions in WHERE part of the query on the fields from some 34 tables out of those 100. Different queries have different combinations of the tables used to produce SELECT part of query and to put conditions in WHERE. But, again, every SELECT would require some 57 tables and every WHERE would requre some 34 tables definitely, the list of tables used to produce SELECT may overlap with the list of tables used to put conditions in WHERE. p  pI can write a VIEW with the underlying code joining all those 100 tables. Then I can write the mentioned above SQLqueries to this VIEW. But in this case it is a big issue for me how to instruct SQL Server that despite the explicit instructions in the code to join all those 100 tables only some 11 tables should be joined 11 tables are enough to be joined to produce SELECT outcome and take into account WHERE conditions.p  pAnother approach may be to create a feature that converts the following fake codep  precodeSELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM TheFakeTable WHERE field112 and field45 codepre  pinto the following real codep  precodeSELECT T1.field1, T2.field2, T3.field3 FROM TheRealMainTable  join T1 on .... join T2 on .... join T3 on .... join T4 on .... WHERE T1.field112 and T4.field45 codepre  pFrom grammatical point of view, it is not a problem even to allow any mixed combinations of this TheFakeTablemechanism with real tables and constructions. The real problem here is how to realize this feature technically. I can create a function which takes the fake code as an input and produces the real code. But it is not convenient because it requires using dynamic SQL tools evrywhere where this TheFakeTablemechanism appears. A fantasyland solution is to extend the gramma of the SQLlanguage in my Management Studio to allow writing such a fake code and then automatically converting this code into the real one before sending to the server.p  pMy questions arep  ol liwhether SQl Server can be instructed shomehow or to be genius enouh to join only 11 tables instead of 100 in the VIEW described aboveli liIf I decide to create this TheFakeTablemechanism feature, what would be the best form for the technical realization of this featureli ol  pThanks to everyone for every commentp  pPS The structure with 100 tables arises from the following question that I asked here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14758912normalizinganextremelybigtableNormalizing an extremely big tableap

The method that actually do the coping is thisp  precodepublic bool IsSavedImageIListltAppConfiggt AppConfigs, string ImageNameFilter      bool IsCopied  false     try              string imgPath  AppConfigs[0].ConfigValue.ToString         File.CopyselectedFile, imgPath    ImageNameFilter  slectedFileName  .jpeg         IsCopied  true          catch IOException copyError              MessageBox.ShowError saving image, Error, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error         return false          return IsCopied  codepre  pAnd here start my questions. I think I need the codetrycatchcode clause here, because this is where the actual execution takes place and makes it easier to return correct status true or false.

So I have two questions, what is the right way to handle this exception, and if I want to pass it to the place where the method is called how can I do itp

Negative 10052 pI have implemented swipe behavior in my list view. So, basically, you can drag a item and items alpha value would change accordingly thanks to code by Roman Nurik a hrefhttpgist.github.comromannurik2980593 relnofollowRoman Nurika amp a hrefhttpgithub.comtimroesSwipeToDismissUndoList relnofollowTim Roesa. The application is doing fine. Basically, on a generic list item, touch is treated as click, so for list without dragging facility, do not find difference between the two. But in my case, since I detect the coordinate at onTouch to judge whether the user is scrolling left to right or right to left. My list does makes a difference between touch and click. So, I want to know do I dispatch a click event manually on list item so that even if user has not clicked and has dragged the item on touch, i still get to call OnListItemClick.p  pThanks.p

I am trying to add a documentlistener to those text fields so that a user can change the data and it will automatically update the xml file every time a number is changed. The problem is that there is no reference to the JTextField to get the text from and it is causing a compiler error. Is there a way to do thisp

So in my case, it seems that the issue error above lies in the fact that debugging in Visual Studio 2010 using x64 browsers would cause the error. With no recourse, I ended up removing IE 10 from Windows Features and going through a painful process of getting IE 9 back on my system, I now can effectively debug using IE x86.p  pIt seems that MS is not pursuing any fixes for this issue of the default browser in VS 2010 from what Ive read. There are in browser tools Ive seen to do the default browser setting changes but dont want to bother with itdont trust it will work.p  pHopfully this helps others dealing with the same pain I have endured...p  pThanksp  pDave p

Negative 10052 pIm working on a project for maze generation using Java, swing, and Java2D. Im fairly new to Java2D so please excuse me if this question is newbish.p  pBasically, I have a successfully generated maze. I wish to draw this maze on a custom JPanel that Ive set up and properly overridden PaintComponent on. The problem I have now is I currently have the ability to draw the maze, but every time I repaint it disappears. Ive solved this by having it redraw the maze every time repaint is called but this seems horribly inefficient. Since the maze doesnt change why should I have to redraw it p  pSo my question is this is there any way to cache the drawing of the maze so I dont have to waste cycles redrawing it every time I can see redrawing it every time for exceptionally large mazes being a major source of slow downs.p  pThank youp

The reason Im storing the title attribute inside of the datatitle on hover, is because I dont want the HTML markup to show in the title and unable to find a solution for removing this HTML markup which is ugly to see that gets displayed via a tooltip from the title attribute.

Negative 10052 pIs there a way to restrict the number of search results returned from SOLR. I am working for a client who would like to restrict the search results to 100 based on search score . I can use rows but that would only restrict the results per page and not the total results. The problem with that is If the sort function of SOLR is used,  it would sort all the results and the product which has 105th rank based on score might come on top because of the low price. I want the sort to happen only on the top 100 results. Is there a way to do that p  pThanks for your helpp  pSupreetp

Negative 10052 pBefore I ask a question, I would like to say that I tried to google the answer, but I did not found any satisfying answer. Therefore, lets start from the goal  it is to learn web application development. Since I am amateur the first sub question would be  what are the best technologies to start to work with. Also I am very well aware that this is a controversial question, and that it depends on developers preferences. However, I need something to begin with, and I need something with a lots of online support. From present perspective, PHP seems to me as the best choice. Please confirm.p  pSecondly, when I choose a scripting language, I need an advice which strongIDEstrong and which strongframeworkstrong is best to use. I know  another controversial question, but I need an advice. I have Ubuntu and Win 7 installed on my machine. I would prefer to develop applications on Windows. However, I have a feeling this could cause some problems during the development, and that it does not offer as much flexibility as some other platforms. Please comment.p  pAnd finally, a most importantly, and the reason for writing this post is the question  how to deploy an app. I have seen tons of tutorials on how to write thisandthat class, functions, forms etc. However, at this point it does not have any value to me   I have to see the most simplest app live, upandrunning, to feel it under my fingertips, and than to start learning about the the advanced stuff. Here a stepbystep tutorial would be an invaluable help.p  pLooking forward to the answers.p  pA.p

Negative 10052 pI understand that a Jerseybased web service is able to associate exceptions thrown by service methods to desired HTTP return codes a hrefhttpjersey.java.netdocumentationlatestrepresentations.htmld0e3491 relnofollowherea. Now, is there any chance to make the client generate exactly the same exception that was generated by the service method I mean, if the server side throws MySpecificException, is there a way to store such information i.e., the FQN of the exception class in the HTTP response automatically, I dont want to turn to methods that build the response explicitly, I want them to return POJOs or void, so that the client can use it to rethrow the same exceptionp

Also, to store passwords in the database I am currently using bcrypt. p  pI think that the most critical part that I do not understand here is the strongdonestrong callback function. I can understand that it simply passes some values, and I know that much to realize that the first parameter of it is the error and the second the data. Still, I do not fully grasp it because I havent specifically provided one as a parameter. For example, if I would have a function like thisp  precode Random Function var randomFunction  function a, b, done      donea, b    Then I would call the randomFunction providing my own done randomFunctionRandom, Words, functiona, b  return a  b  codepre  pStill, in my example I am not the one specifying the strongdonestrong callback. Is it simply a required callback function parameter or is it the same as the next function in a normal middleware such asp  precodefunction middleware req, res, next      nextreq.user  pass the req.user to next middleware  codepre  pAlso, where does Passport.js bind the user that it handles Does it bind it to strongreq.userstrong And how can I pass it to certain views in order, for example, to display the usernamep  pI am looking forward to your feedbackp  pThank youp

Negative 10052 pIm implementing a free text search feature. User can enter any keyword, e.g. a date string..p  pI want it to be flexible 2013 Oct, Oct 2013, 201310 etc. should all be recognised. And because App Engine search API only recognise date formate as YYYYMMDD, if I get 2013 Oct, I need to translate it into searchdate  20131001 and searchdate lt 20131031.p  pI manage to use dateutil.parser.parsesearchdatestr, but the problem is if any date component is missing, it will use todays data. e.g. 2013 Oct will be parsed as 20131027. In that case, I cant tell if user is keying 2013 Oct 27 or just 2013 Oct.

Negative 10052 pIm new to ASP.NET MVC 4 and Im struggling with a concept that would be easy in webforms.  So, if I have a Customer class, and a Customer has an Address, how can I edit both the Customer and Address on the same form in the same submit action  I would like to create an Edit partial view for the Address, but I dont know how to wire the controller up if there is no submit button for the Address.  I just want a single button to save all the Models in a single View.  p  pSo, I could create a new CompanyView model, view, and controller and do it that way.  However, if I have many objects having Addresses it seems like a lot of work to keep creating View Models to allow you to edit both the object and the address in the same form.

Negative 10052 pI am trying to find the most central character in a data set that contains every Marvel character and every book theyve been in. The code I have written below works for a small test file that we created ourselves to test the method more quickly but when I run the code on the Marvel file, the code breaks from the very beginning. I put print statements through the whole code to find where it stopped working and I thought it would be something to do with iterating through so many characters but it doesnt work right from the start. In the very first while loop I add startVertex to the group and I wrote a System.out.printlngroup statement right after I added startVertex and when I run the test, the print statement gives [] which Im pretty sure means that the group isnt getting any anything from startVertex and then gets stuck in an infinite loop but for a small list of charactersbooks the code works perfectly fine...

Negative 10052 pI implemented a Java Application over my personal machine. The application execution time takes about 20 seconds on my machine. I migrated to a server machine that is 10x as powerful as my personal machine. Unfortunately, the application takes on this server machine twice the execution time. I am pretty sure JVM version and settings are same on both machine, both works as server not client and both run Windows 7p  pThe only thing I suspect that the OS on my machine is native while the OS of the server is run on a virtual machine with dedicated huge memory and 2 physical processors. Am I right Does running Java Application in a Windows virtual machine impacts the performance despite having 10x more powerful hardwarep

Negative 10052 pI have an application say, TcpApp sending pure TCP messages i.e., no SOAP, no envelope ... just a raw string or even bytes. I need to connect ESB to listen those messages over a specific port say, 3333, and make some mediation for now, do nothing but logging is enough. I think it would be a good idea to make an ActiveMQ queue from TcpApp and then to make a proxy service from JMS in the ESB instead of connect directly the ESB to the TcpApp. I read several samples and answers, but always the contect is XML, and TCP is only the transport. What sometime happens is that applications send no special formats over TCP sometime called telegrams. I tried to change the content type, but still the ESB refuses to read the TCP port.p  pcodeltparameter nametransport.tcp.contentTypegttextplainltparametergtcodep  pMay be Im still confuse with the architecture of the solution, but I think a Broker, or an ESB like WSO2, should work is this case as a mediator from this TcpApp. I prefer to disscus the solution before to get the real config to make it work. All comments, welcomedp
Negative 10052 pIm building an Android app using GPS localization, and for that purpose I need first to display localization parameters like speed, time of last fix, deltatime, distance, an so on.

Negative 10052 pIf a emvariableem points to a null reference in memory, then Java Garbage Collection will deallocate the memory, when it runs which is nearly never known.p  pThus, is it more efficient to point an object to a null reference when youre done using it in a method, or is it better to have one allocation as a class variablep  pFor example, is it better to do thisp  precodeprivate TestFile TestFile  new TestFile public class Configuration  Methods accesing TestFile       codepre  porp  precodepublic class Configuration  public void getFileName TestFile TestFile  new TestFile TestFile.getName TestFile  null   public void setFileNameString name TestFile TestFile  new TestFile TestFile.setNamename TestFile  null        codepre  pIm not sure if, for the second example, you have to restate the constructor in each method, but my reasoning is that if the constructor variable points to null, and is removed, theres a high change for a NullPointerException to be thrown almost always again, GC is extremely sophisticated, and nearly impossible to predict.p  pLastly, I would NOT ever want to run the GC method, from my understanding, as it can mess up the schedule that GC has set, as well as cost more performance to run the method, than the resources its collecting prematurely would.p  pThanks for the helpp

My question is about the delegation pattern i use,  if i am generating problems in the background that i have no idea of, or if there is a better way to handle my situation in AFNetworking...p  pI have created an API for my app by subclassing AFHTTPSessionManager.

But once i make calls this API more than once like this IT WAS LIKE THISp  precodeEVEAPIHTTPClient client  [EVEAPIHTTPClient sharedEVEAPIHTTPClient] client.delegate  self [client getCharacterListForKeyIDself.keyID vCodeself.vCode] codepre  pPrevious calls delegate was being overwritten by next. So i changed to above style. Passing sender as an argument in the functionp  precodeEVEAPIHTTPClient client  [EVEAPIHTTPClient sharedEVEAPIHTTPClient] [client getCharacterListForKeyIDself.keyID vCodeself.vCode senderself] codepre  pAnd i pass this sender to GET requests success and failure blocks.p  pWhat i wonder is  Is this a good programming practice . Passing objects to blocks like this should be avoided if possible  Is there any other more elegant way in AFHTTPSessionManager to handle this type of work making same GET request over and over with different parameters and returning results to the respective request owners more elegantly  p

Negative 10052 pIm making a basic pong game and right now, I need to figure out how to get the value of the paddle with respect to x when its on the left and on the right.p  pI have an idea of what I might be able to do, but I need some help Im new to Python. So heres what Im thinkingp  pThe width and height of the entire screen that the game would be displayed on is 600 by 600. This I know for a fact. So to get the value of the paddle, in terms of x if its on the left side, would it look something like thisp  precode   def getleftself       if self.x lt 300          return self.x codepre  pMy reasoning behind this was that if the paddle were on the left side, that would mean that the x value would be LESS THAN the halfway mark of the entire playing screen. Is this on the right track And I was thinking that for the right side, it would be something similar except, it would be self.x  300 in the if statement. p  pIm not sure if this is the correct reasoning, but I would appreciate it if I got some feedbackp

Negative 10052 pI would like to implement a custom graph data structure for my project and I had a question about proper memory management. p  pEssentially, the data structure will contain nodes that have two vectors one for edges coming into the node and one for edges coming out of the node no looped edges. The graph is connected. The graph will also contain one entry node that will have no edges coming into it. An edge is simply a pointer to a node.p  pMy question here is What would be the best method of clearing up memory for this type of data structure I understand how to do it if there was only one entry edge at which point this structure degenerates to a nary tree, but Im not sure what to do in the case where there are multiple nodes that have edges going into a single node. I cant just call delete from an arbitrary entry node because this will likely result in double free bugs later on. p  pFor example, suppose I had this subgraphp  precodeC lt B   A codepre  pIf I were to call delete from node B, I would remove the memory allocated for C, but A would still have a pointer to it. So if I wanted to clear all the nodes A had connections to, I would get a double free error.p

Negative 10052 pI am building a RSS reader using the Play Framework, play authenticate, and mongodb accessed through Morphia. Its running on a Ubuntu server with a VIA Nano processor U2250 1.6GHz Capable and 2ghz ram apparently. Despite every tweak and optimization I could think of, I still observe insane delays in the answering time from 2seconds to 1 minute to answer a simple HTTP GET request to mark an item as read Ill talk about this example because it is simple. Note that i am not facing this problem on local tests on my personal machine, just on remote deployment.

I have made the references explicit using a custom class Reflt because Keylt was handling package names fairly poorly.

Negative 10052 pI need to run a relatively slow external program a couple million times on my data. This external program is called RNAup, a program for determining the binding energy between two RNAs. In many cases, it takes up to ten to fifteen minutes per RNARNA pair.

Negative 10052 pEDIT So it looks like the problem is that the string that getNum is supposed to convert to a float is not actually a string containing all the characters of the token.  Instead it contains the character immediately following the token, which is usually NaN so the atof converts it to 0.  Im not sure why this behavior is occuring.p  pIm working on a scanner  parser that evaluates arithmetic expressions.  I am trying to implement a method that gets a token stored as a string which is a number and turns it into a float, but it always returns 0 no matter what the token is. p  pI was given the code for a getcharacter function, which I am not sure is correct.

Negative 10052 pIm currently working on a project that involves using an electron gun and it would be really nice to know the spot shape of the electrons coming out of the gun the frequency of electrons at some x,y away from the center of the beam.  Our current assumption is that the beams spot shape is somewhat gaussian.p  pWe have a picoammeter hooked up to a detector that outputs that current corresponding to the number of electrons that hit the detector.  The detector is circular with some radius, R.  p  pIf Im not mistaken, sweeping the beam and recording readings from the picoammeter will result in an matrix that is the convolution of the beam spot shape and a 2D step function thats 0 outside of R and nonzero inside R.

Negative 10052 pWhat is the best way to handle a complete AppFabric meltdown, ie ALL cachehosts go downp  pAt the moment, my cache client access methods ie putget are wrapped up in a try catch block with a null return on failure.

To get round this I have implemented a boolean that will cause the application to avoid all caching until we get a successful DataCacheFactory instance. Does this sound like a reasonable solutionp

Negative 10052 pThis is my first time posting on here so bear with me please.p  pI received a bash assignment but my professor is completely unhelpful and so are his notes.p  pOur assignment is to filter and print out palindromes from a file. In this case, the directory isp  precodeusrsharedictwords codepre  pThe word lengths range from 3 to 45 and are supposed to only filter lowercase letters the dictionary given has characters and uppercases, as well as lowercase letters. i.e. dkasdas so something like qevvavveq may count as a palindrome but i shouldnt be getting that as a proper result.p  pAnyways, I can get it to filter out x amount of words and return not filtering only lowercase though.p  precodegrep ... usrsharedictwords  grep ..1  codepre  pAnd I can use subsequent lines for 5 letter words and 7 and so onp  precodegrep ..... usrsharedictwords  grep ...21  codepre  pBut the prof does not want that. We are supposed to use a loop. I get the concept but I dont know the syntax, and like I said, the notes are very unhelpful. p  pWhat I tried was setting variables x... and y.. and in a while loop, having xxy but that didnt work syntax error and neither did x..p  pAny help is appreciated.

Negative 10052 pBy mistake, the option on custom sizing options was set at 500 in the section change the size of all items.

Changing the screen orientation to vertical in hopes of accessing more options allowed me to see the left panel but not more. Using ctrl  mouse doesnt change the size inside the Display section. The computer doesnt have a restoration point to go back to, and I cant uninstall the applications because it isnt my laptop. p  pI have been searching for the correct command to execute but the closest I have found is Display Properties control desk.cpl and it is not the command I need. By the way, the  computer is a lenovo using windows 8.1 in spanish.

Negative 10052 pSo Im using JQGrid to produce a table. The data is read from a database and the table is populated via JSON. Once the table is rendered all the sorting and editing is done locally until the data is saved backed into the database.

I have been following this example a hrefhttpwww.oksoftgmbh.comjqGridSortaleRows1.htm relnofollowherea as is does exactly what Im trying to do, but looking at the source code as not done me much good.

Negative 10052 pCould anyone tell me how to install applications into Tomcat for Sonarqube 4.1 please or point me to some documentation as Im failing to find itp  pI have taken over some software Im still learning about and Im a bit confused about how the applicationtomcatsonarqube mechanism works.  Essentially in Jenkins on our build server I set up a different project which used updated references of spring and elastic search.  I ran this and the old project stopped working.  Eventually I tracked this down to the fact that the new version of the java project installed into the base Tomcat directory DProductionTomcatwebappsROOTWEBINF and so now the running version of the application Jenkins fires up to test against with a verify command has the wrong version of elastic search and so fails.  i.e. if I run p  ptest sonarsonar Dsonar.forceAnalysistrue Dacceptancep  pit runs fine but as the application code is solid but if I add Dsonar.phaseverify it fails as the application currently installed into Tomcat is not .  Im not sure how I managed to install the new code into Tomcat perhaps this is automatic on running  but I wondered if anyone could tell me how I can safely remove the current version installed into Tomcat and replace it with the version being run by Jenkins now p  pI cant help feeling I must be missing some documentation somewhere but I just havent found anything so any help would be appreciatedp  pApologies if this is a bit garbled please ask for clarification if you think you can helpp  pMany thanks p

Negative 10052 pI have an SVN repository that just recently started complaining on checkouts of a particular folder that the checkout fails due to E160006 No such revision XXX, where XXX is the number of a particular revision.  The missing revision appears to date from 6 years ago.  Checkout of other folders works fine.  I am not sure what caused this, but several weeks ago I switched to using a backup of my original repository that I had been maintaining using svnsync.  I also recently updated my ubuntu linux operating system, which lead subversion to request that I execute svn upgrade on my working copy, which I attempted, but I had to stop the upgrade because of a missing VPN connection, which lead to a completely nonfunctional working copy but I dont see how problems with a working copy could be related to this problem with checkout more likely the problem is in the other direction.p  pIs there anything I can do to fix this problem for example, to recover the missing revisions or just instruct subversion to ignore them  I have the original repository that the svnsync repo was generated from, but this original repository lacks recent commits.p  pThanks, Davidp

Negative 10052 pAt a current client, the architect is insisting on using codeXmlSerializercode and its associated attributes to serialize an object model to XML which will ultimately form the basis of a file format. p  pI am dead against this approach. Bear in mind that this clients staff are not highly skilled developers and the contractors were brought in specifically to implement best practices and design principles as its a Greenfield implementation. I have been struggling to construct the arguments, until I decided to go back to base principles i.e. SOLID.p  pstrongReason 1 XmlSerializer violates Single Responsibility Principlestrongp  pWhen I create a model object for my object model i.e. class Person, I can describe the class as follows p  blockquote   pPerson class describes the attributes and properties of a Person within the system.p blockquote  pOnce I add the codeXmlSerializercode attributes, the description becomes p  blockquote   pPerson class describes the attributes and properties of a Person within the system strongandstrong   how those attributes and properties are serialized to XML.p blockquote  pNote the strongandstrong. Thus, violating strongSingle Responsility Principlestrong.p  pstrongReason 2 Over the longterm, codeXmlSerializercode results in classes that violate the Interface Segregation Principlestrongp  pAs this is a file format, the one thing that is guaranteed over time is that file formats change and migration needs to occur  codeXmlSerializercode is supremely stubborn in terms of it speaks one XML schema based on its attributes and that is it. Adding attributes like codeObsoleteAnnotationcode while it does not stop a normal developer from using that particular attribute, does stop the codeXmlSerializercode from serializing values tofrom that property basically acting like a de facto codeXmlIgnoreAttributecode. p  pThis is where an codeXmlReadercode or even codeLINQtoXMLcode serialization implementation would save massive amounts of effort for the developers in terms of longterm maintenanceenhancement, despite the initial development effort and maintains the strongInterface Segregation Principlestrong because codeXmlSerializercode forces the developer to keep propertiesattributes around in class interfaces that they do not use, in order to migrate from one version of a file format to another.p  pstrongNotestrong I am NOT saying that use of codeXmlSerializercode everywhere strongisstrong necessarily bad design tho the strongSRPstrong argument holds true for all implementations, only in the situation where interfaces are changing i.e. for a file format.p  pKeeping strictly to the application of SOLID principles to a changing file format and using codeXmlSerializercode as the serialization technology  is my analysis of the application of SOLID principles correctp

Negative 10052 pI have an opensource VCVS2010 project base which I am testing for the last few days. I can hook using a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusprojectsdetours relnofollowDetoursa a DirectX9 Game on the server, then send off the captured screen buffer to the client. The client views the game as a video.  As you may know Cloud Gaming is the norm. But I have stumbled into a serious issue. When I am playing the game at the client, all is ok, all events captured at the client mousekb are sent back to the server and the server replays them, fine  I can see from the logs that events are correctly reaching the server. but as soon as the game window is minimized at the server, all goes crazy. The logs show me the mouse and KB events are reaching the server, but since them game window is minimized, the game is not reacting to my clicks. Putting it simplep  p1 Server is a dll that Hooks into the Game exe. 2 Once hooked, client can connect to the server, client events are relayed to the server, server sends the events down into the game. Game play fine 3 When I minimized the game window  whatever I do the game wont react. I still see the game window visible on the client end. p  pDoes this mean Windows7 64bit is basically EATING away the events before they the server can relay them to the game Or just because the game is minimized, the mouse and kb events have been taken over by windows while the server is accepting the events.p  pSendInput... Windos API function is called to replay events at the Server which is basically sending the events to the hooked game window SetWindowsHookEx when it receives the client input from the network. p

Parameters ruleid, timestamp,curtimestamp.Timestamp is unixtimestamp of the day, curtimestamp is the unixtimestamp of the beggining of the current day.  These functions work as follows. For each rule they are returning the beggining of the rulebegins and the endingends. If the rule is not repeatable, they return codestartdatecode and codeenddatecode that are stored in the Rules table. If the rule is repeatable, they construct codebeginscode and codeendscode of the closest nonnull daystartdayend of the RegularRules table. For instance, there is an event that has 2 rules. The first one is not repeatable with begins codestarttimestampcode and ends codeendtimestampcode. The second one is repeatable and has just two nonnull fields codemonstart  36000code and codemonend  64800code. codeGETBEGINScode will turn codemonstartcode in unixtimestamp based on current unixtimetamp and current unixtimestamp of the beggining of the day. codeGETBEGINScode works simmilarly. Code of these functions will be provided if necessary. p  h1Problematic queryh1  pThis query should return emongoingem geographically and chronologicallyclosest events. Places should be distinct. So query should for each place return chronologically closest event and at the end sort resulting values depending on time and distance with some coefficients emI think sorting part will be moved to the serverside language like PHP. If you have suggestions about this sorting I am open to any solutionem. For example, there are 5 movies in 10 cinemas near by. Each cinema has 100 schedules.

Negative 10052 pI am writing a OS X application in Swift and considering implementing a portion of my model code MVC pov in Rust in order to gain portability of usage on a web server since Swift doesnt extend into the web server space.p  pIf I compile my Rust code as a dynamic library .dylib and follow certain guidelines, I understand that it will produce an external interface that will look like a typical C interface that Swift can then consume.p  pstrongWhat would the performance implications be of Swift communicating with the dylib in this instancestrong Would they be any different to communicating with something written in C The model component in the dylib can be assumed to be central to the application and hence the communication is anticipated to be chatty.p  p[If I were to code the whole thing in Swift, the model portion would have been contained in a separate frameworklibrary which is very similar to a dylib in any event.]p

Negative 10052 pIm pretty new to both MongoDB and StackOverflow as a questioner. Ive seen a great response for how to return a MongoDB count projection from a Spring repository using the Query annotation a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16715010countinspringdatamongodbrepositoryCount in Spring data mongodb repositorya.p  pBasically the count example looks like Queryvalue  productDetails.productType regex 0, options i, sourceDescriptor 1, count  truep  p...and the method returns an int. I want to do a similar thing, but the int I return is a sum rather than a count. The Query annotation doesnt look like it was built to support a sum operation, but thats what I need.p  pI fear that Im hosed and I have to iterate over a collection of documents to get to the result I need.p  pI have a collection of transactions like debits and credits, positive and negative amounts.

Negative 10052 pIm new to android and I am creating a MAC spoofing app. I have created an IntentService to spoof the MAC address in the app every 5 seconds and it is working fine. Then I created a BaseActivity which all of my activities extend from, this is so I can detect when the app goes in the background or not, this is also working fine.

Negative 10052 pI am new to git and I keep all my git repos in one folder inside an NTFS disk so that both Windows and Linux partitions can see it. The problem is that executable files in that folder cant be given execution permissions in Linux.p  pFor the repos that contain executable files, Ive been working in a directory of the Linux partition, so that I can execute them, and then once Im done editing them, I copy them back to the relevant repo folder to keep versioncontrolling them.p  hr  pstrongSide note for GolezTrolstrong  emWhen I say executables, I mean, for example, code.cppcode or code.javacode files. If I want to compile those on an NTFS partition, I will get an error if I try to run the executable. So I cant work in the NTFS folder, I have to work in the Linux partition. Think for example, the workspace folder in Eclipse. I cant make any app work if I place it in the NTFS folder. So I have to move it to the Linux partition, edit my files, and then copy the relevant files back to the repo folder in the NTFS partition. Im not tracking the executables, Im tracking the files that produce those executables. I hope this clears it up.emp  hr  pI was wondering if there is a way to keep the versioncontrol of those files in their repo folder, while the files live in the Linux partition, so that I dont have to copy them back when Im finished editing, and I can still see them from Windows. Something like a link to the executables folder that lives in the repos folder, maybe it would probably be nice to be able to edit them from Windows too, as if they really lived in the repo folder, but I guess that wont be possible. p  pI searched SO and found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17391904keepgitfilesinanotherfoldera similar questiona. I tried the first answer, although its not exactly what Im aiming for, but it didnt work for me.

Now I get a different errorp  precode git init fatal Invalid gitfile format pathtoexecutablesfolder codepre  pI think I didnt understand the answer.p  pRegarding the second answer, I couldnt understand how to implement it either.p  pSo, wrapping up, my question is... stronghow can I have the executable files in a folder in the Linux partition but version control them from the repo folder in the NTFS disk Would it be possible to make Windows see those filesstrongp  pP.S. I would like to avoid if possible getting into mounting or editing fstab files.p  pP.S2. This question is different to the one I linked.

Negative 10052 pI want to enable clients of my Python GAE app to upload files directly to GCS using a specific object name and GCS parameters I set up front such as cache control and ACL, and perform some actions after the upload has finished.p  pI currently use the codeblobstore.createuploadurlcode for this. However, since I cannot give any parameters or object name up front, I need to copy the entire file to a new location on GCS from within the uploaded callback handler.

All my instances are launched by autoscaling one master instance.p  pNormally if we are not under an ELB, an nginx server block would be listening to 80 with no sslcertificate entries, or listening to port 443 ssl with sslcertificates.p  pGoing over AWS documentation, it doesnt not answer me the following questionsp  p1 By default, when HTTPS is selected as a load balancer protocol, the instance protocol would be HTTP. Why is that Dont we need to secure the connection between the ELB and instancesp  p2 I already have multiple certificates. Wildcard ones and ones for single subdomains, as well as selfsigned certificates. How do I move them to the three blocks which AWS allows me to edit Private Key, Public Key Certificate and Certificate Chain. p  p3 Next, do I remove the SSL configuration in my server blocks if the instance protocol is going to be HTTP Should it listen to port 80p

Negative 10052 pI have a sinopia NPM registry running on AWS and I have a load balancer pointing to it. Setting up the load balancer with port 80 forwarding to port 30901 works beautifully.p  pI would like to turn on SSL so I set up the ELB to use port 443, and forward that to 30901, and the ELB has a cert and does SSL termination, then sends plain tcp traffic to the instance. However for whatever reason, when I do this with sinopia, sinopia doesnt return a response. When I use https with sinopia, it just sits there and hangs.p  pIs there a setting I need to adjust in sinopia to get it to workp  pAFAIK sinopia is still answering things in raw http, so it shouldnt need to know the difference between http and https, but for some reason https breaks it.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 10052 pI want to dynamically click on a set of unordered list items without displaying the results of the clicks. The intent is to preload dynamic content such as images and text that clicking on the list items will normally load and display I want to preload the content as much as possible before the user begins to click on list items. Ive inherited code from another developer and Im having to work within the constraints of his routine, so please bear with me.p  pEach list item has an ID, likep  precodeidw273 idw175 idw123 codepre  pThese would be my references. The list items are generated dynamically, and each contains an HREF to content that will be displayed in a hashed area of the page the content consists of serverloaded images and text extracted from a SQL database using a query. p  pNormally, clicking on a list item changes the content in that area of the page, but it takes time to load. Once its loaded, though, it can be redisplayed without reloading, of course, and so revisiting it is instantaneous...its the initial visit that takes time. p  pId therefore like to preload emallem of that content by dynamically clicking on emeachem of the list items in succession without displaying the resulting content, all done in the background, leaving the default content which is automatically retrieved using the first ID in the clicklist in place. I mention this detail to explain that the page loads initially with the first list items content displayed, and that behavior should remain unchanged.p  pHow could I accomplish this with Javascript or JQueryp  pstrongMORE INFOstrongp  pOkay, heres the skinny. The content is informed by a major containing php script that houses content from an inner php script. The outer script creates an image carousel whose thumbnails reference the inner script as hashes. At any given point, the URL will take this formp  precodeg.phpgid45a.phpaid238 codepre  pThe outer script is the g.php script. It references a thumbnail image in the carousel identified by the a.php script whose GET value is the key to loading the inner content on the page.p  pThe individual thumbnails in the carousel are HREFd like thisp  precodeltligtlta hrefa.phpaid467 idw467gtltimg srcthumbimage.jpg gtltagtltligt codepre  pSo clicking on this one would revise the previous URL top  precodeg.phpgid45a.phpaid467 codepre  pNotice, though, that the content generated by the g.php script doesnt change, therefore. The inner a.php content switches as a hash change when its corresponding thumbnail in the carousel is clicked. Its a surprisingly effective solution, with a few caveats.p  pThe main caveat is that nothing is preloaded except the content referenced by the first link which corresponds to the first thumbnail in the carousel, and that behavior is hard coded into the routine and is fine.p  pI simply want to dynamically click each link in the list to load all of the content, and to do it in the background after the page has loaded with the first links content exposed which is its default behavior, and, as Ive said, which is fine. And it must be done invisibly. p  pIt also doesnt matter in what order it happens, because the user might immediately advance the carousel and click on the 14th element in it rather than the 2nd element. So, I dont want to preload the content in batches of 10 or similar increments, waiting for the user to interact with the carousel to load more content that makes no sense, provided the design of the carousel and how it is intended to be used in any nonsequential manner.p  pI simply need to loop through all of the list item links and load them invisiblyin whatever sequence they should happen to load, provided the asynchronous nature of AJAX. More than likely, the user emwillem click on one of the links that has been preloaded by the preloading routine, but if the user jumps ahead and selects something thats still in the process of preloading, thats not a problem by the time the user has examined that content, the rest of the content will have been preloaded.p  pSo, thats more info. I hope this provides a better backdrop for understanding what Im up against. Without completely rewriting the entire routine, the best bet seems to be to accept its own mechanism and accommodate it by looping through an AJAXJQuery routine that dynamically clicks and preloads all the data in the background once the page has displayed its initial content. And I do have access to the IDs of the links in the unordered list other identifying information could easily be added to it.p
Negative 10052 pI am trying to output an array of values from a C function wrapped using SWIG for Python. I know how to do this for the simple case of returning a C array using the following typemapp  precodeapply double ARGOUTARRAY1, int DIM1 double outputarray, int length codepre  pwith the associated C code looking likep  precodevoid MyClassretrieveArraydouble outputarray, int length      for int i0 iltlength i         outputarray[i]  array[i]  codepre  pThe usage from Python looks likep  precodeoutputarray  myclassinstance.returnArraylength codepre  pHowever, I want to take this a step further and return an array using an index into a multidimensional array.
