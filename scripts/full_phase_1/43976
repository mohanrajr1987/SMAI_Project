Positive 43976 pI bring a decimal value from SQL Server to a Silverlight app c and do an excel export. p  pIn Silverlight, I have the data column defined as a decimal and then export that data into an excel spreadsheet. p  pIf the value is NULL from DB, it converts the value to 0 in the excel. In this case, if the value is NULL, I want the excel to show a blank instead of 0. p  pIs it the case that Excel does not accept a NULL value and therefore, by default, converts the value into either a blank if string datatype or a 0 if number datatypep  pMy fix thus far is to make datatype in Silverlight a string. Thus for NULL values, it outputs a blank. p  pIs there a better way to handle this conversion for NULL values p

How can i enforce this 500 user to use strong192.5XXXXstrong at same time.

Positive 43976 pI have a number of Silverlight apps hosted in an ASP.Net Web Forms Application based on the Navigation Application template.  My company has upgraded to IE11 and we are now experiencing the White Screen of Death on browser refreshes and after using the Back button.  A lot of searching has me believing that the only way to solve the WSOD is to replace the object tag that Im using with JavaScript to load it during the onload event of the html body.  While it does appear to fix the WSOD, when I navigate to other pages, the url in the browser does not update, therefore the Back button navigates to the previous web page not Silverlight page.  It appears the the generated html tag differs a bit  possibly most significantly by the applicationxsilverlight vs. applicationxsilverlight2  I did note that the Silverlight.js file does contain the 2, so Im not sure why the output does not use it.p  pHas anyone dealt with this before and come up with a workaroundp  pOriginal codep  precodeltdiv idsilverlightControlHost stylepadding0pxgt         ltobject idSilverlightClientControl datadataapplicationxsilverlight2, typeapplicationxsilverlight2 width100 height100gt           ltparam namesource valueltGetXapLocationgtgt           ltparam nameonError valueonSilverlightError gt           ltparam namebackground valuewhite gt           ltparam nameminRuntimeVersion value4.0.60129.0 gt           ltparam nameautoUpgrade valuetrue gt           ltparam nameinitparams idinitParams runatserver valueltGetInitialParamsgtgt           lta hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkID149156ampv4.0.60129.0 styletextdecorationnonegt               ltimg srchttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId161376 altGet Microsoft Silverlight styleborderstylenonegt           ltagt         ltobjectgt         ltiframe idslhistoryFrame stylevisibilityhiddenheight0pxwidth0pxborder0pxgtltiframegt      ltdivgt codepre  pUpdated JavaScript version function called in onload event of body tagp  precodefunction createSL              Silverlight.createObjectEx                     source ltGetXapLocationgt,                     parentElement document.getElementByIdsilverlightControlHost,                     id SilverlightClientControl,                     properties                          background white,                         version 4.0.60129.0,                         height 100,                         width 100                     ,                     events                          onError onSilverlightError                     ,                     initParams ltGetInitialParamsgt                           codepre  phtml generated by object tagp  precodeltobject width100 height100 idSilverlightClientControl datadataapplicationxoleobjectbase64,long string of characters  typeapplicationxsilverlight2gt           ltparam namesource valueClientBinTicketMaintenance.xap9242015 35125 PMgt           ltparam nameonError valueonSilverlightErrorgt           ltparam namebackground valuewhitegt           ltparam nameminRuntimeVersion value4.0.60129.0gt           ltparam nameautoUpgrade valuetruegt           ltparam idinitParams nameinitparams valueMATaxFreeStartDate8152015, MATaxFreeEndDate8162015gt           lta styletextdecoration none hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkID149156ampampv4.0.60129.0gt               ltimg style altGet Microsoft Silverlight srchttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId161376gt           ltagt ltobjectgt codepre  phtml generated by the JavaScriptp  precodeltobject width100 height100 idSilverlightClientControl datadataapplicationxoleobjectbase64,long string of characters  typeapplicationxsilverlightgt     ltparam namebackground valuewhitegt     ltparam namesource valueClientBinTicketMaintenance.xap9242015 35125 PMgt     ltparam nameinitParams valueMATaxFreeStartDate8152015, MATaxFreeEndDate8162015gt     ltparam nameonError valueslEvent0gt ltobjectgt codepre

Ive found that in order to have all the data you want ready at your fingertips, they repeatedly execute queries behind your back, for example, that linqtosql query above might run an additional query per row of Customers to get Orders.p  pHowever, the EF not doing this seems to majorly violate the principle of least surprise. While it is a technically correct way to do things You should run a second query to retrieve orders, or retrieve everything from a view, it does not behave like you would expect from an ORM.p  pstrongSo, is this good framework design Or is Microsoft over thinking this for usstrong p
Negative 43976 pWe have a composite application built using the Composite UI Application Block CABSmart Client Software Factory SCSF.  To date, each module in our composite app has used its own set of DTOs, and business logic has been duplicated throughout the module, both in the UI layer and the Service layer.  I would like to pursue more DomainDriven approach in order to encapsulate business logic in a domain layer that can be distributed to the UI tier and the Service tier, and ideally across modules.p  pWe have multiple modules in our composite application under development at one time, and we need to be able to deploy them in any order.  Ideally, I would like for our modules to share a common domain model, but Im afraid that when we deploy a new version of the domain model along with a module, that we will need to regression test the other modules against the domain model.p  pThe alternative seems to be duplicating the domain model in each module, but all that code duplication smells funny to me.

Negative 43976 pSo, I understand the problem of finding the longest simple path in a graph is NPhard, since you could then easily solve the Hamiltonian circuit problem by setting edge weights to 1 and seeing if the length of the longest simple path equals the number of edges.p  pMy question is What kind of path would you get if you took a graph, found the maximum edge weight, codemcode, replaced each edge weight codewcode with codem  wcode, and ran a standard shortest path algorithm on that Its clearly not the longest simple path, since if it were, then NP  P, and I think the proof for something like that would be a bit more complicated P.p

Negative 43976 pI have a Java EE webapp that works perfectly when I run it on Eclipse and my local tomcat server Ive also tested on a friends tomcat server, but not on a production server. p  pThis is the problem The app is supposed to create a folder at a specific location Ive tried hardcoding this as well, but when run on the production server, it doesnt create it and throws no exceptions that it was unable to create it. Later on in the code when its trying to use those files, it complains that they dont exist.p  pI thought this could be a process permission issue, although I start the tomcat server in init.d using sudo, so the process should be root and have no permission problems If you have any thoughts on this, I would love to hear them. Thanks a lot guys. p  pp.s. All the computers Ive tested on are Max OS X10.5.6 and the production server is RedHat Linux Unsure of version, but quite recent. p
Negative 43976 pThis is a WinForm MDI application problem .net framework 3.0. It will be described in C. Sorry it is a bit long because I try to make things as clear as possible.p  pI have a MDI application. At some point I find that one MDI child form is never released. There is a menu that creates the MDI child form and show it. When the MDI child form is closed, it is supposed to be destroyed and the memory taken by it should be given back to .net. But to my surprise, this is not true. All the MDI child form instances are kept in memory. This is obviously a memory leak. Well, it is not a real leak in .net. It is just that I think the closed form should be dead but somehow there is at least one unknown reference from outside world that still connect with the closed form.p  pI read some articles on the Web. Some says that when the MDI child form is closing, I should unwire all the event handlers, otherwise some event handlers may keep my form alive. Some says that DataBindings should be cleaned before the form is closing otherwise the DataBindings will add references to some global Hashtable and thus keep my form alive.p  pMy form contains quite a lot things. Many event handlers and many DataBindings and many BindingSources and few suspected controls containing user control and HelpProvider. I create a big method that unwires all the event handlers from all the relevant controls, clear all the DataBindings and DataSources. The HelpProvider and user controls are disposed carefully.p  pAt the end, I find that, I dont have to clear DataBindings and DataSources. Event handlers are definitely causing the problem. And MDI form structure also contributes to something.p  pDuring my experiments, I find that, if you create a MDI child form, even if you close it, there will still be one instance in the memory. The reference is from PropertyStore of the main form. This means, unless the main form is closed application ends, there will always be one instance of MDI child form in the memory. The good news is that, no matter how many times you open and close the child form, there will be only one instance, not a big leak.p  pWhen it comes to event handlers, things become more tricky. I have to address that, all the event handlers on my form are anonymous event handlers. Here is an example codep  pOn MDI child forms design code...p  pButton btnSave  new Button p  pbtnSave.Click  new System.EventHandlerbtnSaveClickp  pWhere btnSaveClick is also a method in MDI child form. The above is always the case for various controls and various types of event. To me, this is a bidirectional circular reference. btnSave keeps a reference of MDI child form via the event handler. MDI child form keeps a reference of btnSave instance. To me again, such bidirectional circular reference should not cause any problem for .nets garbage collector. This means that I do not have to explicitly unwire the event when the form is being disposedp  pbtnSave.Click  btnSaveClickp  pBut the truth is not so. For some event handlers, they are safe. Ignoring them do not cause any duplicate instance. For some other event handlers, they will cause one instance remaining in the memory similar effect as the MDI form structure, but this time caused by the hanging event handlers. For some other event handlers, they will cause every instance opened in the memory. I am totally confused about the differences between these three types of event handlers. The controls are created in the same way and the event is attached in the same way. What is the difference Dont tell me it is the event handle methods that make difference. Anyone has experience of this wired scenario and has an answer for me Thanks a lot.p  pSo now, for safety issue, I will have to unwire all the event handlers when the form is being disposed. That will be a long list of similar code for each control. Is there a general way of removing events from controls in recursive way using reflection What about performance issuep  pThats the end of my story and I am still in the middle of my problem. For any help, I thank you.p

Negative 43976 pI am using VSTS 2008  C  .Net 3.5 to develop a console application. For file access, we can access file in exclusive mode which blocks other processthread from access the file  which has the effect of lock the file.p  pI am wondering for directory, are there any builtin API or solution to make the directory exclusive access  has the effect of locked For example, if one thread locks the directory, other threadprocess can not call Directory.GetFiles, can not write file to the directory, can not read a file from the directory, etc.p  pthanks in advance, Georgep
Negative 43976 pWe have a large table, with several indices say, I1I5.p  pThe usage pattern is as followsp  pApplication A all select queries 100 use indices I1I4 assume that they are designed well enough that they will never use I5.p  pApplication B has only one select query fairly frequently run, which contains 6 fields and for which a fifth index I5 was created as a covered index.p  pThe first 2 fields of the covered index are date, and a security ID. The table contains rows for 100 dates in date order, enforced by a clustered index I1, and tens of thousands of security identifiers.p  pstrongQuestionstrong dies the order of columns in the covered index affect the performance of the select query in Application Bp  pI.e., would the query performance change if we switched around the first two fields of the index date and security ID  Would the query performance change if we switch around one of the last fieldsp  pI am assuming that the logical IOs would remain unaffected by any order of fields in the covered index though Im not 100 sure.p  pBut will there be other performance effects Optimizer speed, caching, etc...p  pThe question is versiongeneric, but if it matters, we use Sybase 12.p  pUnfortunately, the table is so huge that actually changing the index in practice and quantitatively confirming the effects of the change is extremely difficult.p

Negative 43976 pFirst off, I am not an AS 400 guy  at all.  So please forgive me for asking any noobish questions here.  p  pBasically, I am working on a .Net application that needs to access the AS400 for some realtime data.  Although I have the system working, I am getting very different performance results between queries.  Typically, when I make the 1st request against a SPROC on the AS400, I am seeing  14 seconds to get the full data set.  After that initial call, any subsequent calls usually only take  1 second to return.  This performance improvement remains for  20 mins or so before it takes 14 seconds again.p  pThe interesting part with this is that, if the stored procedure is executed directly on the iSeries Navigator, it always returns within milliseconds no change in response time. p  pI wonder if it is a caching  execution plan issue but I can only apply my SQL SERVER logic to the AS400, which is not always a match.p  pAny suggestions on what I can do to recieve a more consistant response time or simply insight as to why the AS400 is acting in this manner when I was using the iSeries Data Provider for .Net  Is there a better access method that I should usep  pJust in case, heres the code I am using to connect to the AS400p  precode     Dim Conn As New IBM.Data.DB2.iSeries.iDB2ConnectionConnectionString   Dim Cmd As New IBM.Data.DB2.iSeries.iDB2CommandSPROCNAMEHERE, Conn   Cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure    Using Conn    Conn.Open     Dim Reader  Cmd.ExecuteReader    Using Reader     While Reader.Read                 Do Something      End While     Reader.Close    End Using     Conn.Close   End Using codepre  pEDIT  after looking about a bit on this issue and using some of the comments below, I am beginning to wonder if I am experiencing this due to the gains from connection pooling  Thoughtsp

Negative 43976 pSo I really like data structures and Ive been working on a class library that implements different types of graphs in different ways.  One of the stumbling blocks Ive had is trying to easily combine specific features of different types of graphs.p  pTo clarify, lets say I have an interface named IGraphltTgt, where T is the data that each node holds.  Now, I also want to have interfaces for IUndirectedGraphltTgt, IDigraphltTgt, and IWeightedGraphltT,Egt, where E is the type used as a weight.p  pId like to be able to provide different implementations of the same types of graph.  For example, Id like to be able to provide a class that uses an adjacency list and a class that uses an adjacency matrix.  The classes may have slightly different implementations of certain algorithms.  As a simple example, determining the neighbors of a given object would be different in each implementation.p  pSo, lets say I have these two class declarationsp  precodeclass WeightedAdjacencyListGraphltT,Egt  IUndirectedGraphltTgt, IWeightedGraphltT,Egt  class WeightedAdjacencyMatrixGraphltT,Egt  IUndirectedGraphltTgt, IWeightedGraphltT,Egt codepre  pId like to be able to declare a variable type that can store objects of both of these classes, yet keep the functionality defined in all interfaces.  Basically, I want to be able to declare a variable type likep  precodeltIUndirectedGraphltobjectgtIWeightedGraphltobject,doublegtgt MyGraph  new WeightedAdjacencyListGraphltobject,doublegt MyGraph  new WeightedAdjacencyMatrixGraphltobject,doublegt codepre  pObviously, the variable type declaration is not correct C syntax, but what would I put here  Do I have to create a new interface for each combination of interfaces  Is my design fundamentally flawed, and if so, what should I do to rectify itp  pEdit  Ive decided to create different namespaces for directedundirected graphs, and to store common interfaces such as IWeightedGraphltT,Egt in the root namespace.  Ill then basically create the combined interfaces I mentioned above which were also noted in the answers.  I figure the directedundirected graphs arent likely to share a whole lot in common when it comes to the fun algorithms anyways.p

Negative 43976 pId like to try implementing a visual swipe for an iPhone project, like they do in some games, like Fruit Ninja.  As you drag your finger around the screen, it leaves a trail that disappears after a while.  I would think that you could have a fixed number of points in the chain and as new points are added to the front, old ones are removed from the rear.  I can see using codetouchesMovedcode to generate new points and an codeNSMutableArraycode to keep track of the points.  I just cant imaging what method Id use to actually draw the segments.  Would I make one codeCALayercode and draw a line connecting the active points  Or use some other view object and join them together at the points...p  pAny ideasp
Negative 43976 pIm currently developing an additional page to an already existing website. Actually that part isnt really that important  the page performs its own separate functions.p  pAnyway, originally, this page consisted of two pages controlled by one jpdl pageflow. Everything worked correctly, except when referencing the second page. The user would input whatever they liked into the fields and click submit. Everything functioned as expected, except the set methods were never called. Despite reading existing values from the Backing Bean, it the setters were never called. I wrote some Seam tests and discovered that I could craft my own codeFacesRequestcode that would call codesetValuecode on the same EL Expression and it worked fine, which pointed me to something failing on the JSF side.

So basically I have thisp  precodeRequestMappingaddResponse.htm public ModelAndView addResponseModelAttributeresponseDTO ResponseDTO              respDTO, BindingResult result, HttpServletRequest request     ResponseFormValidator respValidator  new ResponseFormValidator  respValidator.validaterespDTO, result   if result.hasErrors    return new ModelAndViewredirectresponseForm.htmid  respDTO.getProjID    codepre  pWhat I want is for the responseForm handler method to remember the errors resulted from the validation process the Result Object Of course, I can copy and paste the logic from that method inside my if statement but Im thinking it must be a better way than just copy and paste.p  pAny help will be highly appreciatedp

Negative 43976 pDelayedjob is finally working for me using the collectiveidea gem in RoR3 for a couple of tasks. The first is for an admin to upload a zip file of images to a gallery and extract each image to build a photo object belonging to that gallery.  The second is deleting galleries.  These galleries can be pretty big 550 pictures in 3 minutes, and Id like to be able to show that a gallery is still being processed or is queued for deletion even if it doesnt show up completely.p  pRight now, Im just using the default technique gallery.delay.extractphotos and gallery.delay.destroy.p  pWhen the admin clicks the extract link, they are directed to the gallery page which is empty with a flash message telling them that its processing the gallery.  Refreshing the page periodically shows the list of images that have been extracted up to that point.  However, its not exactly clear when the job finishes, since refreshing once clears the flash message. Basically, Id like to be able to either show a progress bar that updates every second or so with quantity progress next to it code[  ] 3386code andor update the gallery to show the images as they are added.p  pDeleting large galleries can also take a lot of time, so Id like to keep that as a delayed job, too.  However, the gallery still exists when you go to the landing page after deleting it, so it shows up until after refreshing after its completely gone.  Id like to either have a way of marking it as queued for deletion or show a progress bar and have it disappear when its finished deleting.p  pIve looked around for RoR3 AJAX help, but everything I seem to find has been for 2.3.8 and is deprecated.  Furthermore, I need to know how to track whether a job is still being performed, and I havent noticed anything like that on collectiveideas documentation.  I figured since jobs are stored in a table, maybe I could track it using DelayedJob.thisjob.exists or something along those lines, but trying DelayedJob.all in the rails console just gave me errors even while the job was running.  p  pSo my question, in summary how can I track a delayed job and display its progress in any of these ways in the view strong[edit]strong I know I can do active polling on the gallery pages, but I dont want to have that happening all the time  just while the job is being performed or is scheduled.  Is there a way to test for the existence of a job thats being performed or that is scheduled to be performed Because I havent found a way track it in the views.p  pThanks.p

Negative 43976 pIn quickhull algo, theres need to build a cone upon set of edges.p  pAn edge is thought as subsimplex with one vertex removed.  It is required, that adding a vertex to an edge will form a simplex, as if that vertex was just replaced.p  pFor instance, when storing simplices as lists of vrtices, for triangle defined with vertexen p0,p1,p2 edges are p1,p2,p2,p0,p0,p1  in this index order. Now, when adding new vertex p at the end of edge vertex list, new triangles are p1,p2,p,p2,p0,p,p0,p1,p They have the same orientation as if original triangle was slanted. p  pFor triangle, edge opposite to p1 has reversed order of remaining vertices. For tetrahedron, it is for p0 and p2.p  pWhat is proper way of storing edges, or proper way to find out when to reverse vertices orderp  pOkay. In general, storing vertex emsetem is just not enough to represent a simplex, if its orientation matters. The same emsetem can represent equivalent simplices with different sign of volume. A emlistem can preserve orientation, but its not trivial to derive it just from order. Thus, neither sets nor lists alone are not good solution to represent both simplex and their edges.p

Negative 43976 pstrongThanks everybody.strong For some reason I couldnt up vote answers, so everyone wins today ] thanks againp  hr  pComplete php and javascript novice here, apologize up front for anything halfwitted.p  pI have a portion of a users profile in which Id like the user to be able to add additional items of the same thing, with slightly different conditions. p  pFor example, lets say its favorite books. A fieldset contains some checkboxes for genre and an input text box for the title of a book. After the user checks a genre and fills in a title, they can add the book to their set of favorite books and then have the option to add another. When done adding books, they move on to the next fieldset, complete the form and submit.p  pHow is this done And moreimportantly, is it possible without javascriptp  pWithout JS, I understand this probably entails a lot of reloading of the page to add the items, regardless Im more confused about how the POST data is handled, both before and after the submit.p  pSorry for such an open ended question, really just looking for someone to point me in the right direction, as searching for this topic proved to be a bit difficult.p  pThanks.p  pstrongSome Clarificationstrong Im trying to develop an application that is as independent of javascript as possible. In that sense, I dont know if its possible to add the new items with PHP alone. My sense is the fieldset in question could have its own submit button, the action of which POSTS to the page itself no DB interaction, etc, and variables like bookgenre1, booktitle1 are populated in the page. Then, the official submit is sent later, which actually adds the POST data, which contains the books array, to the DB. But I dont know if that is a safe procedure or good logic to begin with.p
Negative 43976 pI have an ASP.NET web app where I use an ado sql connection to connect to a database on a SQL Server. The ado connection string is provided with a user login that has sufficient rights to readwrite to the database. I originally pushed out the web app in its own IIS web site, using its own application pool and everything worked fine. p  pHowever, I am now trying to include the web app under an already existing web site. Everything seemed to work fine until I tried any functionality that called for an INSERT or UPDATE to the database. It turns out the user connecting to the DB didnt have sufficient permissions. Finding this strange, I did some research and found a forum post that suggested the IIS Web Site service account needed readwrite permissions in the SQL database in order for an app to perform INSERTUPDATE. Is this truep  pI tested it out, and yes, indeed it worked, only with the Application Pool Identity account. The details of my scenario are as followsp  ul lipThe web apps first IIS Web Site had an application pool Identity that ran under NETWORK SERVICE, which already had a login for SQL SERVER pli lipThe already existing web sites application pool Identity runs under a domain account. This site already runs another web app that connects to the same database using LINQ developed by someone else. I am relatively new to web development and am more familiar with ADO, so that is the route I chose.pli lipThe domain account mentioned above formerly had no SQL Server loginuser mapping. I set it up as a dbowner, and viola, the new web app worked under the existing web site.pli ul  pWhile I found a way for it to work, we would rather not create a SQL login for this Identity account. We want the login provided in the web apps ADO SqlConnection to be the one to actually connect, because isnt that the point of it Also, the fact that another web app using LINQ can connect just fine under the same web site leads us to believe this is possible. Any experts out there have two cents to offer on this issuep

Interestingly, I am not sure how to read this matrix. I have two variables which are clearly strongly positive correlated.

Negative 43976 pId like to have our user landing webserver POST XML to our computation web server to crunch over the XML data.

In my django filters, i use a filtering query likep  precodeBillRecords.objects.filtersubscribernoicontains123456 codepre  pSince the codesubscribernocode the customer said might be quite shortened version of the real number...p  pThat filter outputs a query likep  precodeSELECT subscriberno FROM BillRecords WHERE UPPERsubscribernotext LIKE UPPERE123456 codepre  pcodesubscribernocode is a char field because some numbers contains alphas and some special chars.p  pOn my database, i have two indexes for that column, created by my colleagues.p  precodeBillRecordssubscriberno btree subscriberno BillRecordsfsubscribernolike btree subscriberno varcharpatternops codepre  pstrongI am wonderingstrong using two indexes for a such query is logical. Since all of our django filter uses codeicontainscode and that supposed to be create queries like i write above. p  pPostgres analyse of the query is as followsp  precodeSeq Scan on BillRecords  cost0.00..159782.40 rows370 width15 actual time579.637..3705.079 rows10 loops1 Filter uppersubscribernotext  123456text Total runtime 3705.106 ms 3 rows codepre  pSo, as far as i see, no index is used. Since index usega have costs in data insertion and update, having two indexes with no usage as far as i can see from this analyse  seemed me not logical.p  pIs there any channce for django to output different queries for a similar codeicontaniscode filter Or my indexes are totally uselessp

Negative 43976 pIm new in programming. From what i know, a program that is compiled in Linux should not be able to run in Windows.

Negative 43976 pI have a parent entity, Person, and two children entities  Caller and Employee. The two children share a lot of fields so i implemented JPA inheritance with single table strategy and discriminator column.So far so good. In order to handle these objects i have some Service classes that handle database operations where i have methods like  getCallerById or getEmployeesByFirstName. Also the save methods are in these service classes. The problem is that when i want to save an employee or an caller i got a lot of duplicate code for all the shared properties, so in order to prevent this i created a 3rd service PersonService in order to handle the common functionality. But now i do not know how to use this service in order to reuse as much code as i can. Maybe in the PersonService to have something likep  precodepublic Boolean savePerson p     if p instanceOf Caller        Caller c  new Caller        c.setCallerSpecificPropertyXXX           if p instanceOf Employee       Employee c  new Employee       c.setEmployeeSpecificPropertyYYY           c.setOtherCommonParameterccc    ............  codepre  por how do you advise me to handle this problem Thanksp

Negative 43976 pOk, Ive searched quite a bit, but seem unable to find an answer or example for how to achieve this.p  pBasically, I have an app that is designed to be portable built using VC in VS2010, but no MFC or managed components, raw WinAPI.  I have Lua 5.2 built into it and allow the user to write scripts inside the application.  I have multiple glued functions which are exposed to the Lua scripts which handle various WinAPI calls.p  pHowever, what Id like to be able to do is allow the user to write a script in which looks something like thisp  precoderequire[[Alienalien]]  local mb  alien.User32.MessageBoxA mbtypes long, long, string, string, long  printmb0, Hello World, Test, 64 codepre  pI simply cannot seem to find a way to do this.  I do not want to require the user to install Lua for Windows and, ideally, there be no core.dll and struct.dll from alien when I tried to do something with those DLLs in .alien, it was crashing in Lua5.1.dll because I had LuaForWindows installed, I uninstalled LFW, and then it just states that Lua5.1.dll is missing.  I have Lua 5.2 built into my app, so obviously the corestruct DLLs from the Alien rock are expecting Lua5.1.dll to be in the path.p  pI made a worthless attempt to try to including the Alien src into the project, but doesnt seem to work that way either.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Id prefer it all be contained in my app, but Ill settle for a solution which involves including the libraries in my project to build and bundle in the distribution if thats the only alternative.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOk, thank you Ben Voigt  I think Im almost there.  Ive pulled in core.c and struct.c and made sure all the paths are there for libffi.

Ive tried to declare the function signature in my separate source file thats trying to make the call, the compile gets further, but fails complaining of an unresolved external.p  pClearly this is likely now a general C issue as Im only a novice in this area.

Negative 43976 pI have a codeUITableViewcode that loads entities from Core Data using a codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode.

Ive implemented the required delegate methods, but it seems that codetableViewtitleForHeaderInSectioncode is being called for every possible section in the fetch at load time. I am grouping by date so there are about 700 sections in the entire table view.

I was expecting this method to be called like the methods that load table view cellsas you scroll through the table.p  pIs there a better way to load the section titles or, better yet, is there a way to defer the loading of section titles to as the user scrolls like is done with the actual table cellsp  pSome things to notep  ul liI emamem telling the fetch request to prefault codedateOfFlightcode using the codesetPropertiesToFetchcode method.li liThe fetch request has a batch limit of 25.li liThe fetch request has no fetch limit.li liI do not need section index titles.

Negative 43976 pheres my setupp  pI have an MVC3 site hosted with a www subdomain e.g., www.example.com.  My site is secured via SSL and forms authentication, backed by ASP.NET membershiprole providers.  I have HTTP handlers providing service capabilities under services e.g., www.example.comservices.  These are secured through Basic authentication over SSL.  I have mobile devices successfully accessingconsuming these services.  I have also created a new site with an api subdomain e.g., api.example.com that will be my publicfacing API.  These services are exposed currently via WCF Web API preview 6 eventually to be migrated to ASP.NET Web API.  These services are also secured via Basic authentication over SSL.  My ASP.NET membership implementation stores hashed passwords i.e., they are not encrypted.  All services serve JSON responses.  All of this stuff works great.p  pHeres my dilemmap  pI started to write a new view on the MVC site and realized it would be great to use Ajax.  My specific case is to implement cascading dropdown lists.  I wanted to implement this using jQuery and a new service under the api subdomain.  At first I thought this would be a simple exercise and then I realized, I have no effective way to call into my own API.  My clients mobile devices all store their usernamepasswords locally so this is easy.  However, if the same user is logged into my site, I have their username but not their password so I do not have a direct way to access any services offered under the api subdomain.p  pAs I see it, I have three solutionsp  ol liImplement services that support the MVC site directly under the services URI, eschewing consuming my own public API.li liCreate a super user in my membership store where I know the usernamepassword that the site uses to access services in the api subdomain.li liChange my authentication strategy.li ol  pIt occurs to me that I probably should not utilize my own public API and would be better served using my own private services which is ok because the logic is all shared via a facade layer.p  pWhat is the recommended strategy here  I also assume that if I were to utilize option 2 or 3, I would have to do so using JSONP.  Is this correctp  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  And if more details are needed, please post and I will update with answers.p  pThanksp

I expect that when I use my string  to create a dir, and read its name back, it should use the same codes as if I applied the encoding directly.p  pIf we look at the code points 97, 778, 97, 776, 111, 776, its basically ASCII characters with added diacritic, e.g. o    , which makes it two characters, not one. How can I avoid this discrepancy, is there an encoding scheme in Python that matches this behaviour by OS X, and why is not getfilesystemencoding giving me the right resultp  pOr have I messed upp

Negative 43976 pThe active object design pattern as I understand is tying up a privatededicated thread life time with an object and making it work on independent data. From some of the documentation I read , the evolution of this kind of paradigm was because of two reasons , first , managing raw threads would be pain and second more threads contending for the shared resource doesnt scale well using mutex and locks.  while I agree with the first reason , I do not fully comprehend the second . Making an object active just makes the object independent but the problems like contention for lockmutex is still there as we still have shared queuebuffer, the object just delegated the sharing responsibility onto the message queue. The only advantage of this design pattern as i see is the case where I had to perform long asynch task on the shared object now that i am just passing message to a shared queue , the threads no longer have to block for long on mutexlocks but they still will blocka and contend for publishing messagestask. Other than this case could someone tell more scenarios where this kind of design pattern will have other advantages.  p  pThe second question I have is I just started digging around design patterns , what is the conceptual difference  between , active object , reactor and proactor design pattern . How do you decide in which design pattern is more efficient and suits your requirements more. It would be really nice if someone can demonstrate certain examples showing how the three design patterns will behave and which one has comparative advantagedisadvantage in different scenarios.p  pI am kind of confused as I have used active object which used shared threadsafe  buffer  and boostasioProactor both to do similar kind of async stuff  , I would like to know if any one has more insights on applicability of different patterns when approaching a problem.p

Negative 43976 pGood day,p  pI am having an interesting problem that I cannot understand. I have a class called HomeScreenManager which maintains a strongLinkedListltStringgtstrong called emchatem. The HomeScreenManager instance lives on the server and is in charge of keeping track of the connections and the chat log. I then created a class called ProtocolHomeScreen which is a class with a strongLinkedListltStringgtstrong called emchatem and implements Serializable.  When it comes time to update all the clients with the chat, I want to send out a ProtocolHomeScreen. So I create a brand new instance of the ProtocolHomeScreen and I say that its linked list of strings gets the HomeScreens linked list. So in other words, the linked list that I want to serialize was created in a different class, but I am pointing to it with another instance. The problem is that the data does not get sent, only an empty LinkedList appears on the other side. Ive done the debugger line by line and inspected all the variables and right before I call writeObject everything appears to be fine, but then on the client side, when I receive the ProtocolHomeScreen instance, the linked list is empty its not null though Any ideas Thank youp  precodepublic class HomeScreenManager implements ObjectMessageHandler, Serializable  protected LinkedListltUsergt users protected LinkedListltStringgt chat protected LinkedListltStringgt sessions  public HomeScreenManager      chat  new LinkedListltStringgt     users  new LinkedListltUsergt     sessions  new LinkedListltStringgt  protected void handleChatString message      chat.addmessage      ProtocolHomeScreen p  new ProtocolHomeScreenthis      forUser uusers              u.connection.WriteObjectp At this point in time, p has the correct data, but when I deserialize p, the chat list is empty...       codepre  pThen here is the protocol class...p  precodepublic class ProtocolHomeScreen implements Serializable      public LinkedListltStringgt chat     public LinkedListltStringgt players     public LinkedListltStringgt sessions       public ProtocolHomeScreenHomeScreenManager hms              players  new LinkedListltStringgt         forUser uhms.getUsers                      players.addu.getUsername                  sessions  hms.getSessions         chat  hms.getChat          chat  new LinkedListltStringgt          forString s hms.getChat                      chat.adds                  codepre  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis is the code on the client side... note that the players LinkedList comes across just fine, but I think that has something to do with the fact that I created a new instance in the constructor of the ProtocolHomeScreen on the server sidep  precodeelse ifobj instanceof ProtocolHomeScreen                             ProtocolHomeScreen phs  ProtocolHomeScreen obj              sessionModel.removeAllElements             playersModel.removeAllElements             chatOutput.setText             forString sphs.players                 playersModel.addElements              forString sphs.sessions                 sessionModel.addElements               forString sphs.chat                              chatOutput.setTextchatOutput.getTexts                        codepre

Negative 43976 pIm building a mobile app that lists posts, each post has a place attached to it.p  pI want the list to be able to show distance from the users location. without caching anything it would require to store the place reference for each post and while listing fetch the places geometry from Google Places API, this sounds like a very bad idea.p  pam I allowed to store the places id, reference, name and geometry in my db and deliver it with my API this is for performance purposes onlyp  panother implementation might be to cache this data in a local sqlite db on the mobile device, but then the user will have to download the information for each uncached place so for a list of X different places the client will be doing X api calls, sounds slow and battery wasting.p  pam I allowed to have a central cache in my db in a table thatll be refreshed every once in a while and evicted if not accessed for lets say 30 days p

Negative 43976 pI have a WCF Web Service that has no concurrency configuration in the web.config, so I believe it is running as the default as persession.  In the service, it uses a COBOL Virtual Machine to execute code that pulls data from COBOL Vision files.  Per the developer of the COBOL VM, it is a singleton.p  pWhen more than one person accesses the service at a time, Ill get periodic crashes of the web service.  What I believe is happening is that as one process is executing another separate process comes in at about the same time.  The first process ends and closes the VM down through normal closing procedures.  The second process is still executing and attempting to readwrite data, but the VM was shutdown and it crashes.  In the constructor for the web service, an instance of the VM is created and when a series of methods complete, the service is cleaned up and the VM closed out.p  pI have been reading up on Singleton concurrency in WCF web services and thinking I might need to switch to this instead.  This way I can open the COBOL VM and keep it alive forever and eliminate my code shutting down the VM in my methods.  The only data I need to share between requests is the status of the COBOL VM.p  pMy alternative Im thinking of is creating a server process that manages opening the VM and keeping it alive and allowing the web service to make readwrite requests through that process instead.p  pDoes this sound like the right path  Im basically looking for a way to keep the Virtual Machine alive in a WCF web service situation and just keep executing code against it.  The COBOL VM system sends me back locking information on the readwrites which I can use to handle retries or waits against.p  pThanks, Martinp
Negative 43976 pIm developing an iPhone app in Xcode 4 and im using storyboard. I am using a single view application. I have a segue that connects my home page controlled by my view controller class ViewController and another view that has a UIImageView in it. On the home page the user is able to pick an image and then the UIImageView on the other view would show that image. I thought at first that the UIImageView would still be on the ViewController class but when i push the second view it shows that it is a UIView and i cant change that. I believe that I have to create another class to handle the second view but I dont know how to do that. Secondly i do not know how to connect that class with the view and then have the segue work. Am i on the right track or am I totally wrong. Help Please... Thank you. PS Now that I typed this out i looked at some of the similar questions and im reading a whole lot about this prepareForSegue method. Is that what is used to segue between view controllersp

Negative 43976 pit seems to me impossible but just checking if there is a magical solution. Assume I have a container movieClip, inside it lies a lot of children movieclips with different names. I wanted to search the children mcs by name using a search criteria whether a regular expression or just a beginwith, endwith  a string. Of course I know that I can loop over the children mcs and filter the ones whose names match my search criteria. But Im not looking for this approach as it is resource consuming. Also I mustnt return an array of matched mcs, if it can return just the first match is enough.p

Negative 43976 pI am currently developping a library for a binary application protocol. The following code sample does not compile static methods definition not allowed in abstract type.

The only solution I can think of would be to get rid of the static method in the base CmdBody class, get rid of the generic aspect and for each CmdBody type make an associated Cmd class class CmdA, class CmdB ... but this will incur a lot of code duplication at the end of the day.p  pAny idea for a nice desing to help me work arround this p
Negative 43976 pI am having a sandwich of canvas and tinymce rich text editor. Now there are two modes, one is to draw on canvas and one is to write text on tinymce.p  pWhen on draw mode then canvas layer comes upwards and tinymce goes below this canvas layer and when on text mode viceversa happens using zindex.p  pWhen I start typing on iPad with canvas layer below text layer it works fine until I move the cursor upwards by touching my iPad screen. As soon as I does that editor gets stuck and to make editor work again I have to hide my iPad browsers keypad and then touch again on editor.p  pThere is one more thing that as soon as I remove canvas from html and there is only one single layer of tinymce then things works perfectly as expected however it works fine on normal pc browser without any issue.p  pI tried to debug and noticed zindex change as expected and when stuck our code does not even detect keypress events on tinyMCE with ipad.p  pAny idea what could be the possible reason or fixp

Fundeps do no local propagation.p      pSo in your first definition, youve locally provided codeInt gt acode, which   is acceptable to GHC. Then it figures out externally to the function   that codeFoo Int a gt Int gt acode is actually codeInt gt Floatcode.p      pIn the second definition, youre trying to give codeInt gt Floatcode, but   GHC only knows locally that you need to provide codeInt gt acode with a   constraint codeFoo Int acode which it emwontem use to determine that codea    Floatcode.p      pThis is not inherent to fundeps. One could make a version of fundeps   that has the local constraint rules easily so by translating to the   new type families stuff. But, the difference is also the reason that   overlapping instances are supported for fundeps and not type families.   But I wont get into that right now.p blockquote  pI still dont understand what that mean. So still looking for better understandable answer. p

Instead Id like the object structure to remain intact so being the smartenoughtobedangerous type I decide to JSON encode the objectp  precode requestparameters JSON.encode requestObj  codepre  pversus just p  precode requestparameters requestObj codepre  pOn the PHP side I now get this as the value of the requestparameters variable aka, POST[requestparamenters]p  blockquote   pforms[formNamemainform,formClasslgform mainform,formFields[idactivityappid,nameactivityappid,value0,typehidden,startingValuenull,idactivitystarttime,nameactivitystarttime,value,typehidden,startingValuenull,idminduration,nameminduration,classspan1 formignore,value50,typetext,startingValuenull,idactivityduration,nameactivityduration,value3000000,typehidden,startingValuenull,idexercisedistance,nameexercisedistance,classinput span1 left,value25,typetext,startingValuenull,idexercisedistanceuom,nameexercisedistanceuom,valuemiles,typehidden,startingValuenull,idexercisepaceaverage,nameexercisepaceaverage,value2,typehidden,startingValuenull,idwppostspostcontent,namewppostspostcontent,classspan5,valuesuper fast,typetextarea,startingValuenull]],actionwentrunning,posttypeexercise,primaryForm0p blockquote  pOk, so this clearly got encoded so that the data would pass as a POSTGET variable without bad things happening. Fair enough. I figured I could address this on the PHP side by employing a decode before running the jsondecode function. I first triedp  precoderequestparameters  jsondecode urldecoderequestparameters  codepre  pThought for sure this would be a winner. Nope. It didnt give an error but requestparameters seems to not be set to anything. Ok, then I went a little nuts and thought ... hey maybe the javascript used base64 encoding ... that led me top  precoderequestparameters  jsondecode base64decoderequestparameters  codepre  pBad juju. Ill leave it there.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 43976 pI have a website with several thousand pages that I have added to TFS source control.  I have created a workspace with the local path mapping to the actual file directory so that anytime a file is saved, the actual source file is saved as well.  I have added my files and then checked them in.  p  pAfter checking them in for the first time I see the lock symbol next to all of the files.  Now if I go to check out and edit, I can check in my changes and this shows up in the changeset, but the file remains checked out.  I can view the history and see all iterations every time it was checked in, but it still always shows the file as checked out.  p  pI think the issue may have something to do with the fact that I created the workspace as a particular user and then made it a Public Workspace.  I now am logged in as a different user attempting to check inout.  p  pI also just noticed that in my history it shows the changes made by UserB, but in Source Control Explorer it shows checked out by UserAp

Negative 43976 pWeve inherited a PHP page which runs fine on Ubuntu, but dumps source code onto the display on a Windows 7 system running either XAMMP using PHP 5.4, or WAMP using PHP 5.3.p  pThe point where the dump occurs seems to be when it tries to parse a  object property character combination. When I change that to [] to access as an array element, it gets past that, but then dumps source code onto the display which appears after the  mapping character combination. Commenting that out doesnt work, only deleting the whole line gets it past there.p  pFinally, when its just printing out html with lt and  signs, that also causes the screen dump. If I replace those characters with the html entities, the source code doesnt dump any more, but the program doesnt display the menu and doesnt function at all. Note that I can successfully log into the app via its login page, although even that displays POST and some other lt and  characters in the username field.p  pIve tried running unix2dos on the whole app, but that didnt have any effect. Also tried converting the text of one of the offending pages to UTF8, but still no luck.p  pIn answer to some of the questions posed p  pThe working ubuntu version is PHP Version 5.3.101ubuntu3.1p  pThe first piece of code that works in Ubuntu and not in Windows is thisp  precodepublic function constructgid      thisgtid  gid     return thisgtretrieve  codepre  pwhere the code dump onto the display starts with p  precodeid  gid return thisgtretrieve  codepre  pYes, PHPInfo does work, showing for the WAMP server with PHP Version 5.3.13p  pI tried changing the  shortopentag but it made no difference. p  pThe product was written for us by an outsourcing group, and it appears to be based on some kind of framework.

Negative 43976 pI am currently in the finishing stages of building an application and have asked the user group to perform productionlevel usage testing on the application.  My application is a makeshift order management system that sends an email to a customer when an order is saved that includes an invoice.p  pI ran into a problem yesterday when I was doing some testing this environment currently contains productionquality data, including old customer records.  I processed a few orders and forgot about the functionality, and the customer who I did the orders for received emails saying the order is complete.  Good that it worked, bad that it lead to this confusion.p  pThe action I would prefer would be to set something somewhere within the application that forces all emails, regardless of the to recipient, to be sent to a specific address, though I would settle for simply being able to turn it off for this application alone.  Turning it off on the server level is available not a preferred option due to the need to perform testing on other applications that process email, but are not populated with productionquality data.  p  pAre there any specific flags or code I can use to override server settings in the application to only send email to a certain address based on how we identify our environment, or to not send email altogetherp

Negative 43976 pI have a Grails application running under Tomcat 7 and am having problems managing MySQL connections.p  pThe problem is that each new request to the application i.e., a page load is creating a new MySQL connection, and these connections are not closing.

If JS is enabled, show that element.pli lipHave no element in the markup and create it on the fly, if JS is enabled.pli ul  pIf the user doesnt have JS, I dont want a div to be shown. My question isnt how to code the different cases, its which is the best and why.p  pstrongEDITstrong When I say best I mean support your answer with why its the best for you. Can be speedsemanticsetc. What I want is to be able to have a better look at the pros and cons of each one. Also the speed is hardly an issue because its only one element so it would be like milliseconds.p  pFor the first option, its probably faster, but then we have unnecessary markup and CSS rules. Because if there is no JS, there would be no point in having the element at all, much less hiding it.p  pNow the second option, even though it might not be as fast, I keep the different parts separate and only really load what has to be loaded.p

Negative 43976 pIm trying to write a Scala compiler plugin that will allow extremely general code generation something like the generality of the C preprocessor, but a bit more typesafe Im not sure if this is a terrible idea, but its a fun exercise. My ideal use case looks something like thisp  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecode User code. This represents some function that might take some args  and outputs an abstract syntax tree. def createFooTree... scala.reflect.runtime.universe.Tree  ...   Later user code maybe separate compilation. Here the user generates  code programmatically using the function call to createFooTree and inserts  the code using insertTree. insertTreecreateFooTree... codepre  pThe important plugin code might look like this based on a hrefhttpsgist.github.comochafik4978627thisap  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecodeclass InsertTreeComponentval global Global   extends PluginComponent   with TypingTransformers    import global.   import definitions.    override val phaseName  insertTree    override val runsRightAfter  Someparser   override val runsAfter  runsRightAfter.toList   override val runsBefore  List[String]typer    def newPhaseprev Phase StdPhase  new StdPhaseprev      def applyunit CompilationUnit        val onTransformer  new TypingTransformerunit          override def transformtree Tree Tree  tree match            case orig  Apply             function,              treeClosure is the closure we passed, which should              evaluate to a Tree albeit a runtime Tree.              The function.toString bit matches anything that looks like a              function call with a function called insertTree.             treeClosure if function.toString  insertTree gt               This function evaluates and returns the Tree, inserting it              into the call site as automaticallygenerated code.              Unfortunately, the following line isnt valid.             evaltreeClosure Tree                 ... codepre  pAny idea how to do this Please dont say just use macros at least in 2.10, they arent general enough.p  pBTW, I see two problems with the approach Ive outlined 1 The compiler plugin takes an AST, not a closure. It would need some way of creating the closure, probably adding a build dependency on the user code. 2 The user doesnt have access to scala.reflect.internal.Trees.Tree, only scala.reflect.runtime.universe.Tree, so the plugin would need to translate between the two.p

I have another user control which contains another data grid and a tab control.

Thanks in Advance.p
Negative 43976 pI have an application that uses two separate models stored in a single database. The first model is set up with migrations and is the one that has created the migrations data in the database. The second is a very simple model that needs no model validation at all  the tables it uses exist and are of the proper structure. The second Context works fine in a separate database with the same table structure.p  pThe problem is it fails when running in the same database with the first model since it does provide some sort of model validation. It complains that the context has changed since the last update, but of course the the migrations data does not contain anything about the second contexts tables.p  pIs it possible to turn off the meta data validation for the context, and just let the second context work against the tables as is, since I know that worksp  pin the context constructor but that has no effect.p

Negative 43976 pI wish to exploit redundancy among a set of strongsimilarstrong codecolored JPGcode images. codeSet redundancy compressioncode has been used successfully for similar code8bit grayscalecode images. They basically find the codeMAXcode and codeMINcode of a set of images and encode the original images as codedifferencescode with respect to either the MAX or MIN image, depending on whichever is the smaller difference. About 2050 strongadditionalstrong compression has been obtained for grayscale images using this approach besides normal compression tools like gzip or bzip. I do the followingp  ul liDecompress the JPG images to RGB char buffersli liCompute the MIN and MAX char buffersli liEncode the difference char buffers as JPG imagesli ul  pThe problem is that to retrieve the original image from the difference image, ideally I would need to encode the difference losslessly. But, there is no codelosslesscode transformation from RGBJPG in libjpeg and even at quality1.0, because the difference coefficients are strongsmallstrong 110, I end up losing almost all the information almost all decoded data is 13. p  pTo solve this, I tried using codehuffman encodingcode of the difference char buffers. p  ul liEncode the difference char buffers using Huffman encodingli ul  pThe original JPG images are of size 256 KB, the corresponding RGB buffer is 7.8 MB and the huffman encoded difference images are of size 2.2 MB.

In reality, I have an ajax call every few seconds to get updated data and I have reams of code to parse it and work out what changes, and either add new nodes to by node array creatively called nodeArray and new links to my link array called linkArray.  I also confuse things a bit by having text labels as nodes, also within nodeArray, with links to their respective node in linkArray.p  pThis time rather than try to describe the issue, I have created two near identical fiddlesp  pa adding a node  this fiddle parses the original data, then after 5 seconds adds a node. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzuzzydFd3H2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzuzzydFd3H2ap  pb removing a node  this fiddle parses the original data, then after 5 seconds removes a node. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzuzzywqS3G1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzuzzywqS3G1ap  pJust look for the following parts of the codep  precodesetTimeoutfunction   update the objects  ...  ,5000   functions for drawing and tick below  function draw   ....   codepre  pThe issue I have is with the complicated way I am approaching this.  All the examples I can find either have a static layout using the ideas I have used like text label nodes, or they are dynamic but they just use simple nodes with circles.  I actually make it even harder than the fiddles because not only do I use circles and text labels but also I overlay an image over the circles...but that was just too complicated for the fiddle examples.  So these fiddles are an extract of my code which also requires intranet pages so doesnt work anyway on jsfiddle so apologies if it looks convoluted and contrived.p  pI know I have done it wrong, and I suspect hope the answer to the problem is the same in both fiddles.p  pI am also expecting that the issues resides in the draw function  thats where I feel the issue should be because rather than follow the normal create a node object, and interact with that formula I interact with the svg object vis directly.p  pThe annoying thing is both fiddles work fine for the initial draw. it is the update that breaks both.p  pAny suggestions  p  pThanksp  pChrisp

Negative 43976 pthis is the problem. A user can submit a pdf file that can be downloaded for other users, who can do modification for the pdf file, basically make comments and annotations. And the users can submit again the file with these modifications. The problem is, how can I manage the versions of the file because if two users try to submit the file with different things, maybe one file can be lost.  At a glance, I try to implement a signature for the files, this is the approach The file in the server is the file A. The users download the file and make their modifications. Now we have the file A1 and file A2. When the user A1 submit the file, the system checks the signature and matches, so can submit the file. The server now signs the file again and changes to B. When A2 tries to submit the file, the system check the signature and determines that B doesnt match with A. so the users needs to download the latest file. Pretty cool, Ah Thats the theory, but I dont know how to implements it How can I append this signature to the pdf file in a transparente way to the user Or maybe im too complicated. Can you give a hint of how to implement it, an api, or a different way Im using java, with spring.  Greetingsp
Negative 43976 pIm working on a project that writes ADO.NET code for a database. Source code located here a hrefhttpsgithub.comchriscartwrightGenTools relnofollowGenToolsa. It reads the stored procedures and tables from a database and outputs C code. I added unit testing to the project using NUnit, and hit a stumbling block on testing the generated code.p  pRight now, Im following these steps to test the generated codep  ol liGenerate codeli liCompile the generated code into an assemblyli liLoad assemblyli liUse reflection to test generated codeli ol  pThe problem with this approach is that the tests have to be ran in order. The next step will never succeed if the previous one fails, and none of the steps can be left out. An example is a hrefhttpsgithub.comchriscartwrightGenToolsblobmasterUnitTestsGenTable.csL115 relnofollowherea.p  pI dont like this setup because once step 4 is reached, a failed test on the generated code will prevent the rest from running. p  pIs there way way to make sure the first 3 steps run sequentially, then have all tests in step 4 seperated out I dont mind switching testing frameworks.p

But, when I run the same query with countryid of the last country in my list 14, the very same query becomes very slow and may take up to 2 minutes 1.2 million records.

Negative 43976 pI have a set of xml files that are kind of defined in a tree like structure. The structure is somewhat like p  proot  view[ config, cheader, aheader ]p  pI would like to be able to define all this in a set of python objects and define a method that O can could to introspect itself and generate all the xml on the fly, depending on the locally instantiated data. Sorry if Im not explaining myself very clearly, but I have very little background in OOP and Design Patterns, while I know this is possible, I just cant seem to explain exactly. What Im trying to find out is some guidelines on how to approach a projectarchitecture like this in a way that is purely OO driven and makes use of the adequate design patterns. Any advice on what patterns do I need to investigate, examples of similar projects, etc, would be very welcome toop

Negative 43976 h2backgroundh2  pOn some apps, it is important to handle large images without OOM and also quickly.p  pFor this, JNI or renderscript, which sadly lacks on documentation can be a nice solution.p  pIn the past, ive succeeded using JNI for rotating huge bitmaps while avoiding OOM link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14398670rotatingabitmapusingjnindkstrongherestronga , a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18250951jnibitmapoperationsforhelpingtoavoidoomwhenusinglargeimagesstrongherestronga and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17900732howtocachebitmapsintonativememorystrongherestronga. it was a nice yet annoyingly hard experience, but in the end it worked. p  h2the problemh2  pthe android framework has plenty of functions to handle bitmaps, but i have no idea what is the situation on the JNI side.p  pI already know how to pass a bitmap from androids java world to the JNI world and back.p  pWhat i dont know is which functions I can use on the JNI side to help me with bitmaps.p  pI wish to be able to do all image operations including decoding on JNI, so that I wont need to worry about OOM when presented with large images, and in the end of the process, I could convert the data to Javabitmap to show the user andor write it to a file.p  pagain, i dont want to convert the data on the JNI side to a java bitmap just to be able to run those operations.p  pAs it turns out, there are some libraries that offer many functions like a hrefhttpscode.google.compjavacv relnofollowstrongJavaCVstronga, but they are quite large and Im not quite sure about their features and if they really do the decoding on the JNIside, so I would prefer to be able to know what is possible via the builtin JNI function of Android instead.p  h2the questionh2  pwhich functions are available for image manipulation on the JNI side on androidp  pfor example, how could i run face detection on bitmaps, apply matrices, downsample bitmaps, scale bitmaps, and so on... p  pfor some of the operations, i can already think of a way to implement them scaling images is quite easy, and wikipedia can help a lot, but some are very complex.p  peven if i do implement the operations by myself, maybe others have made it much more efficiently, thinking of the so many optimizations that CC can have.p  pam i really on my own when going to the JNI side of android, where i need to implement everythign from scratchp  pjust to make it clear, what im interested in isp  pinput bitmap on java  image manipulation purely in JNI and CC no convertion to java objects whatsoever output bitmap on java.p

Negative 43976 pI am building a configurable applet not Flash, but HTML and Javascript. The planned functions are similar to a car configurator, where you select color, engine power or seat covers. The actual product will be listed by various online shops as a single product. The configuration should be done within the page that presents the product.p  pThe shops in question all use different CMSes. The problem is, that Id have to write code for each shopping system to integrate the applet into the shop. Is there an industry standard for doing this Or if that is not the case Where is the point of minimal necessary communication of the shop with the configurator, where Id best place the interfacep  pMy current idea is to to configure the shop on page load by a JSON object, telling it about its environment and about the last state of the product someone might want to alter an ordered product. Once the user has finished configuring, an AJAX call is used to send the configuration to the server. There the product is added to the shopping cart and a redirect to another page product overview etc. is requested.p  pIs this a good way to do that What would be betterp

If this application is hosted by a Web Farm or cluster, ensure that  configuration specifies the same validationKey and validation algorithm. AutoGenerate cannot be used in a cluster.p blockquote  pI started getting the error after we upgraded our network monitoring software and SQL version.p  pThe page is an ASP.NET 4.0 web form external to the site its being displayed on, written in C with a bit of JavaScript and a fair bit of SQL. It also heavily uses .NETs chart forms As in six chart areas on the chart, each with multiple series dynamically generated via SQL. We went from a free version of SQL Server 2008R2 to a trial of the full SQL Server 2012 instance and updated our SolarWinds Orion version to NPM 10.6.p  pThe code is a large charting program which tracks the health of a variety of statistics averaged across each of our networks. The problem is, they asked for scrolling charts which means autoupdating. Im using a form refresh instead of a meta or full postback because there are a wide variety of variables which allow the charts to stay on a specific statistic, network, page, and time window so that when the user leaves it alone, it will refresh and keep the view they were originally looking at. If its not more than 5 minutes ago, it will keep updating. All those values are being stored in the ViewState. Originally, it was even worse, being stored in hidden literals on the page.p  pUpdating the software didnt magically turn this into a web farm or cluster and we dont have a virtual environment, though we may soon.p  pstrongThe Researchstrongp  pI understand the problem is caused by the ViewState refreshing at an inconvenient time and causing the validation of the key to fail because the page loads out of sync with the validation algorithm.

What alternatives do I have My superior and I dont think setting the key is good from a security standpoint. Im willing to tweak the code to store things a different way. Ive had to use session state elsewhere, but Im still new to it. Would that run into a similar problem with refreshing before some sort of validation takes place Can I force the refresh to run more slowly Ive also seen something about altering where the key validation happens.

Negative 43976 pI have a lot entries of data, each entry consists of 8 eight numbers.p  pFor each entry I know fitness score i.e. how good this entry.p  pAnd, I want to buildfind approximation function fitness score dependent on those 8 parameters. Not only mathematical representation of this function is ok for me, but any implementation like NN wich will give me plausible fitness score for arbitrary new entry.p  pI tried Neural NetworksEncog library and Genetic approach Watchmaker library. Second approach gave me much better results than NN. However, I represent approximation function as sum of eight a  powx, b components, where a and b are mutated by GA and x is parameter of data entry. Despite on fact that I have some positive results with help of GA, obviously, this is not the best approach. p  pSo, the questions are  what are the ways to improve searching approximation function in my case Are there any other methods than NN and GA p  pThanks.p

Negative 43976 pAs a proof of concept kind of project, I have set up a sharded MongoDB, with only two shards, and three servers running mongos instances. All of these are on their own Windows servers, but Id like to try running the cluster on Linux systems, because Im seeing some strange behaviour that I think emmayem be related to the fact that the systems are all running on VMs on a corporate ESX server. Also, Im just curious.p  pAfter reading as much documentation as I could find, Ive found that the mongos instances that dispatch queries to the proper shards are lightweight and can typically be run on an application server or a system with a mongod instance a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualtutorialdeployshardclusterstartthemongosinstances relnofollow titledocumentationdocumentationa.p  pstrongMy question isstrong, can MongoDB be configured so that the strongmongosstrong instances run on a Windows server, while the strongmongodstrong instances the shards be run on a Linux system Would the strongmongosstrong instances still be able to dispatch queries to the Shardsp  pOne reason this would be beneficial in my case is that my application is a .Net web API, that I want to host in IIS, so it has to run on Windows. The benefit to running shards on Linux, which may be an incorrect assumption, is that a Linux system requires less overhead than Windows server, meaning it would be less expensive if it were run on a VM from a cloud provider.p

Negative 43976 pI have this question   You are given a singly linked list L where each node in L stores an integer key, and a pointer to the next node in L. The last node has its next node set to NULL. You are given a pointer ptr to a node storing key k, which is not the last node in the list. Show how to delete the key k from the list given ptr the pointer to the node that contains k your algorithm should have time complexity O1, i.e., it should be independent of the length of the list. Assume you have pointers to the head and tail nodes of L.p  pI know that if we have a doubly linked list we can delete the node in O1 time complexity,  but how can we do it in singly linked list  dont we have to iterate over all the list in order to find the node just before it p

Recently I was assigned to work with a coworker and before starting the project we were discussing the code standards we were going to use specifically for the forms.p  pOne of the approaches was to use the form view.p  pThe other approach was to use the labelstext boxes directly on the form and use validate on the form which action it was going to use. p  pWhat you guys think is the best approach for form apps where normally the navigation goes from a grid with a lot of values to the detail where the user can edit the values if he has the privileges.p

Negative 43976 pIve reached a point where I would like to write an automated test to verify the content of a WPF View thats bound up to a View Model in a particular state. p  pIn concept, its fairly simple. Create a View Model, set its state, create the appropriate View, add the View to a Window, set the Data Context of the View, show the Window, take a screenshot, compare against a previously taken screenshot. This sort of test is useful to detect unintended changes, as well as verifying that all the View can actually be created without error.p  pHowever, creating an instance of my View is proving problematic. It requires a set of resources that are not included in the XAML definition itself. These resources are included in the Application level resource dictionary in the actual application, so by the time the View is created in the real application, those resources are already available to it.p  pWhen I create an instance of this View inside my test, it throws a XamlParseException about being unable to find various resources understandably.p  pI do not want to simply add appropriate resource dictionaries to the XAML definition of the View itself because this would increase the amount of effort computer effort required to create one of these View objects, as well as increasing the amount of memory required for each instance. My understanding is that this is a result of ResourceDictionarys not being shared in that way.p  pI have triedp  ul liCreating an instance of App.xaml inside the test which sets the Application.Current property.li liSetting the Application.Current.Resources property to the the Resources property of an instance of App.xaml.li liSetting the Resources property of the Page directly.li liSetting the Resources property of the Window directly the Window the Page is being added to for the test.li ul  pstrongEssentially, I need to know if there is a way to engineer a situation where I can configure a set of Application resources for standalone instances of WPF components to use inside an automated test.strongp  pYou can reproduce the problem by creating the following structure, with everything but the ViewTest.cs file in one project, and the ViewTest.cs file living in a test project.

I could not get the interdependencies between dictionaries in the MergedDictionaries to work. I couldnt even manually flatten the ResourceDictionary instance, because when I tried to access a resource in a dictionary that was dependent on a resource in a parallel dictionary it threw a XamlParseException.p  pAs a result, the idea of injecting a ResourceDictionary into the View via a constructor was not feasible for use in my solution although it works if the app resources are a flat ResourceDictioanry.p  pAt the end of this journey, I have come to the conclusion that the only way to instantiate a View where the xaml does not directly contain references to the resources without having to instantiate the entire App is include references to the appropriate ResourceDictionary wherever a resource is used, directly in the xaml. You then have to manage the performance issues at run time because youre instantiating hundreds of duplicate ResourceDictionaries by using a SharedResourceDictionary there are a number of implementations of this concept available on the internet.p

The formatting beneath the selection isnt disturbed so if the user clicks anywhere on the worksheet, all the original formatting is intact.p  pMy question is can I select rows and highlight them in a color besides standard blue bright pink so the user can see them more easily  I dont want to have to reformat the interior colors, and then try to figure out how to unformat them when the user is done noticing them.p  precodesRowsToHighlight  196196,201201,203203 mwksPST.RangesRowsToHighlight.Select    Turns them blue, but I want a bright color codepre  pAfter my code is done, I would want selection to revert to the standard Excel color scheme.p  pThanksp
Negative 43976 pIn my application Id like to get all the IP addresses that are taken by computers in the LAN using the broadcast address. I used the following code to determine the broadcast address.p  precodeInetAddress getBroadcastAddress        try            WifiManager wifi  WifiManager getSystemServiceContext.WIFISERVICE       DhcpInfo dhcp  wifi.getDhcpInfo        handle null somehow        int broadcast  dhcp.ipAddress amp dhcp.netmask  dhcp.netmask       byte[] quads  new byte[4]       for int k  0 k lt 4 k         quads[k]  byte broadcast gtgt k  8 amp 0xFF       return InetAddress.getByAddressquads          catch Exception e            e.printStackTrace          return null    codepre  pNow that I have it, as far as I know, when one uses the broadcast address, every computer answers it, so if I simply send a ping message to that address, the computers of the LAN will answer it. How should I ping them in Android What command would send me the taken addressesp  pThe following code simply returns the packet from the sending phone but I need the computers addressesp  precode int PORT  8080  int DISCOVERYPORT  8080  try     DatagramSocket socket  new DatagramSocketPORT   socket.setBroadcasttrue   String dataTEST   DatagramPacket packet  new DatagramPacketdata.getBytes, data.length,   getBroadcastAddress, DISCOVERYPORT   socket.sendpacket    byte[] buf  new byte[1024]   DatagramPacket packet2  new DatagramPacketbuf, buf.length   Log.wTags.DEBUG,Receive start   socket.receivepacket2   Log.wTags.DEBUG,packet2.getAddress.toString      catch Exception e        e.printStackTrace    codepre  pIs it even possiblep  pEDITp  pIf Im honest it works as it is written my phone sends an UDP packet and my phone receives the incoming packages. As the only package is coming from my phone, it is obvious that the address is my phones address. However, if the broadcast address is valid, each network interface should send the signal back.

Negative 43976 pI got a problem with Cocoa and its View redraw hierarchy.p  pIm currently testing displaying audio levels in a meter style control and Im using the MeteringView class from MatrixMixerTest example project from apple. This class is drawing the meter and only drawing the difference what got changed which looks like a very efficient class. p  pMy project is splitted into 2 splitviews, in some are NSCollectionViews Scrollview, Clipview and in others are only static views. If I add the meter to those static views they work fine when these views call setNeedsDisplayYES. If a meter is added to the view of a CollectionView Item it gets rendered, but loosing its drawn old level parts and its cornersbackground. I think this happens because the CollectionView item gets also called to be redrawn which has a background image and everything is gone. It is drawing some parts whats currently changing the drawing works.p  pIs there a way to prevent the Item itself to be redrawn Or, I dont know why it is not happening in those static views, because those views also have background images but do not draw over the meter.p  pAre there some tricks or whats different in a CollectionView than in a normal viewp  pstrongEDITstrong After reading about isOpaque MeteringView isOpaque  YES means it should not call the parent views drawRect if set to yes. Well that works for the static views, those MeteringViews do not call parents drawRect, but those in a CollectionView do however. I dont know why.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong I gave this topic another title, because isOpaqueYES in MeteringView is not stopping calling the parents drawRect in a CollectionView, in a normal view it is working. Are there some things to know about I have to stop redrawing the CollectionView Item because thats the problem.p  pThanks in advance guysp  pBenjaminp

Negative 43976 pThere is a question in my operating systems book about scheduling a system. p  pThe question is  A realtime system needs to handle two voice calls that each run every 5 msec and consumes 1 msec of CPU time per burst, plus one video at 25 framessec, with each frame requiring 20 msec of CPU time. Is the system schedulablep  pThe solution manual has this answer Each voice call runs 200 timessecond and uses up 1 msec per burst, so each voice call needs 200 msec per second or 400 msec for the two of them. The video runs 25 times a second and uses up 20 msec each time, for a total of 500 msec per second. Together they consume 900p  pThe book does not explain how to come to this conclusion, or gives an algorithm. So I was hoping someone could explain how this answer is worked out p  pThank you.p

Negative 43976 pI currently have a quite big issue here, which Ive been trying to figure out since yesterday, but I really dont know what could be the problem here.p  pSo I basically made a jQuery Ajax call in my code, something like thisp  precodevar ajaxCall  functionid, token      var datap   id id, token token       .ajax         type POST,         url ajax.php,         data datap,         dataType json,         beforeSendfunction                       loading image         ,         success functiondata                     settingdata         ,         error function                      alerterror               codepre  pAs for the success function you can see the codesettingcode function, which looks like thisp  precodevar setting  functiondata      testDiv.htmldata.country  codepre  pBasically, this ajax call is made, once someone clicks on an item likep  precodepopup.onclick, function     ajaxCall  codepre  pSo when someone clicks in the popup button, they will have a popup window open with the loaded Ajax content.p  pThis is actually working flawlessly. My only problem happens, if I want to make another event within the Popup window like on click.p  precodevar load  function      testDiv button.onclick, function         alert1       codepre  pSo if I place it in the above Ajax call function, it looks like the followingp  precodepopup.onclick, function     ajaxCall     load  codepre  h2strongProblemstrongh2  pWhen I click on the opoup button, to load the popup window, it loads the Ajax content. When I try to click on codebuttoncode within the popup window at the first time, after loading the page, it gives me the alert box with 1. p  pHowever If I just close the opoup window and click on it again, to load the popup, than click on the codebuttoncode again, now I got the codealert1code strong2 timesstrong If I do the above again, I got it strong3 timesstrong, strong4 timesstrong, and so on.p  pSo basically Ive found out, that if I use the codeon Clickcode function within the popup window, after ajax has loaded, the contents within the codeon Clickcode function got called more times, if I load the popup window more times without refreshing the page  after refresh, everything strats from the beginning.p  pSo the first popup load and click is normal, but the others seems to get called more times. I have also checked that the Ajax call is called multiple times, but its NOT. I have placed an increment number inside each part of the code and I only got it incremented multiple times when the codebuttoncode was clicked.p  pI know that this is quite hard to understand, but I would really need someones help here, as Im completely lost. Any solutions would be really appreciated.p

Negative 43976 pI have been puzzled lately by an intruiging idea. p  pI wonder if there is a known method to extract the executed source code from a large complex algorithm. I will try to elaborate this questionp  pScenario There is this complex algorithm where a large amount of people have worked on for many years. The algorithm creates measurement descriptions for a complex measurement device. p  pThe input for the algorithm is a large set of input parameters, lets call this the recipe.  Based on this recipe, the algorithm is executed, and the recipe determines which functions, loops and ifthenelse constructions are followed within the algorithm. When the algorithm is finished, a set of calculated measurement parameters will form the output. And with these output measurement parameters the device can perform its measurement. p  pNow, there is a problem. Since the algorithm has become so complex and large over time, it is very very difficult to find your way in the algorithm when you want to add new functionality for the recipes. Basically a person wants to modify only the functions and code blocks that are affected by its recipe, but heshe has to dig in the whole algorithm and analyze the code to see which code is relevant for his or her recipe, and only after that process new functionality can be added in the right place. Even for simple additions, people tend to get lost in the huge amount of complex code. p  pSolution Extract the active code path I have been brainstorming on this problem, and I think it would be great if there was a way to process the algorithm with the input parameters the recipe, and to only extract the active functions and codeblocks into a new set of source files or code structure. Im actually talking about extracting real source code here. p  pWhen the active code is extracted and isolated, this will result in a subset of source code that is only a fraction of the original source code structure, and it will be much easier for the person to analyze the code, understand the code, and make his or her modifications. Eventually the changes could be merged back to the original source code of the algorithm, or maybe the modified extracted source code can also be executed on its own, as if it is a lite version of the original algorithm.p  pExtra information We are talking about an algorithm with C and C code, about 200 files, and maybe 100K lines of code. The code is compiled and build with a custom Visual Studio based build environment. p  pSo... I really dont know if this idea is just naive and stupid, or if it is feasible with the right amount of software engineering. I can imagine that there have been more similar situations in the world of software engineering, but I just dont know. p  pI have quite some experience with software engineering, but definitely not on the level of designing large and complex systems. p  pI would appreciate any kind of answer, suggestion or comment. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 43976 pIm working on a new, large project that I am unfamiliar with. Im trying to trace down where a certain part of an event is triggered and I think Ive nailed it down but Im not 100 sure.The event which deals with one button on a menu is dealt with on a very abstract level because of all the dependency injection. Because of this, my break point only shows variables in a very abstract form. Deep down inside them I believe that there are some values that correlate to my specific button ie the label.

Here I just want to be able to provide a dataframe, and three variables. The function should provide the mean of the variable in the y position for each combo of the codexcode and codezcode variable.

Negative 43976 pI would like to make an app with the same beahavior as Facebook and Instagram app. I mean, I would like to make 4 independent tabs, which each one can load fragments, update action bar but keep the loaded fragment and update the content with an actionbar button in the Activity.p  pWhat I have I have 4 tabs loading fragments and with a OffScreen limited to keep the content loaded, but the problema is because I dont have access to the loaded fragment from the activity which I could update the actionbar title and update just the content of that fragment. Ive looked for some solutions, but it didnt work because they just could retrieve the root fragment, not the loaded fragment after user navigates inside that fragment and load another ones.p  pI would like a behavior as the facebook. It keeps the state of the fragment of each tab and also can refresh just one fragment and they also update actionbar title.p

Negative 43976 pI am developing a Web application into GWT and I am using the Object DatePicker. This object retrieves the date in a defined format which I am translating into a String such asp  precodeWed May 14 2014 0000 codepre  pFor me it is useful to use this date as String for some operations. However, for one of them I need the Timestamp object. For that reason, I am making use of the SimpleDateFormat object in the following wayp  precodeSimpleDateFormat sdf  new SimpleDateFormatE MMM dd yyyy HHmm Timestamp tDateIni  new Timestampsdf.parsesDateIni.getTime codepre  pYet, when I run the remote debug I get a ParseException. Do you know what could the mistake be I think I am using in a bad format the SimpleDateFormat object in the part E MMM, but I am not sure. Thanks a lot in advancep
Negative 43976 pI have a small project with one bureaucratic organisation where I need to create a mobile app based on data from their website. The site isnt optimized for mobiles and its extremely difficult for users to use the site from their gadgets. The aim of the project is to provide information in convenient view and simplify the working processes of users actually, I need to create 3 buttonslinks and when a user press a button heshe can see some information.p  pThe first button is easy to develop because it should only show news of the company which is shared for everyone. There are many opportunities to get this data and one of them is to get the source of the page and parse tags.p  pBut, two other buttons is a pretty tough task, because to get the data for them a user should be logged on Despite the company is very bureaucratic, the site was made by some outsource organisation, so neither they nor I have access to database and the site sources. p  pI tried to find out the type of POST request recording tcpdump, but, of course its encoded. I believe theres a simpler solution, but I cant find it, and need your help. Unfortunately, Im not a webdeveloper and dont know resources of web technologyp  pstrongCould you kindly advise me please, whether its possible to make some kind of a wrapper which would make dynamic design of webpage according to the browser For instance, when a user presses one of these two buttons I show custom login screen customized login screen of the companys website, I virtually remove all design and make input fields and button bigger, the user provides details, press login button and I show customized view of a report removing all needless stuff, etc.strongp  pIn other words, just imagine, youre login to you gmail account which design of login page is customized img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEzCkC.png altplease look a picturep  pAfter some manipulations with Chromes element inspector you can get something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQhMKA.png altenter image description herep  pAlthough the web page was modified, if I press Sign in button I still can login to my account. How can I getdevelop similar tool for my android appp  pPerhaps you have a better solution, please dont hesitate to propose  If my explanation of the problem isnt clear just let me know please and Ill add some more information.p  pThank youp

Negative 43976 pI have a dilemna that I thought I was solving pretty good so far. However, when I test it with a UITableView I get all kinds of warnings such as p  precode[NSCFString substringWithRange] Range 2147483647, 2147483701 out of bounds string length 56. This will become an exception for apps linked after 10.9. Warning shown once per app execution. codepre  pI will describe what Im trying to do before I post my method below. Basically, when a user uploads a profile photo, I set a unique substring after their username, but before the file extension .png Example a username of JohnDoe takes a new profile photo, I set the file name to be p  precodeNSString file  [NSString stringWithFormatJohnDoe.png,[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString]] codepre  pI do this so the app can tell later if it needs to download a users friends new profile picture, based on seeing if this complete NSString is saved to disk locally, if I cant find it saved locally, I simply download it from the web. The problem is most likely coming from the UITableView calling the method continuously.p  pAlso, this needs to be done on the client side, so please dont discuss backend related solutions.p  pThis is the method I came up with to get the actual unique NSString of the users profile image file name. This method of mine is called in the code UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPathcode methodp  precode NSString actualPhotoPathNSDictionary input       This code needs work, ridiculous bottle neck     NSRange r1  [[input objectForKeypic] rangeOfString[input objectForKeyusername]]     NSRange r2  [[input objectForKeypic] rangeOfString.png]     NSRange rSub  NSMakeRanger1.location  r1.length, r2.location  r1.location  r1.length      Hangs up on the below line of code eventually     NSString sub  [[input objectForKeypic] substringWithRangerSub]     NSString actual  [NSString stringWithFormat.png,[input objectForKeyusername],sub]     NSLog,actual     return actual  codepre  pI appreciate any help offered Thank youp

Negative 43976 pI seem to continually see compile errors in mine and the projects of others where, in particular, sizet is detected as redefined. Sometimes this can be traced back to an x86x64 mismatch but often it seems to make no sense at all and be the result of a whole nested collection of includes I am not responsible for.p  pThe Visual C error returned is powerfully unhelpful, simply suggesting redefinition without pointing out where the first definition happened. I am looking for a way of finding all definitions that are actually participating in my build and detecting the error. I have looked at the header file, it is protected from redefinition so that leaves me with no more ideas.p  pThe present project is building an Arduino project in VC. I have removed all connection to the default GCC headers, only using the Arduino header paths, and only including a single header file, Arduino.h, once. Strangely, with no headers included at all, sizet is defined, but with Arduino.h it is. A corollary question would be where is this definition coming fromp
Negative 43976 pI have an interesting problem. I need to write a general Id use the word generic but that would conflict with what Im after routine that I can hand an instance of a dictionary object instance and iterate over the content of said object as a dictionary and return the content as literal values. The difficulty lies in that the method parameter will be of type object, not dictionary.p  pWhat I need now and cant figure out how to do, is a way of iterating over a codeDictionaryltK, Vgtcode of arbitrary keys and values. Easy to do if you know the types going in, but as I say, the origin of the dictionary will be as an object where object.GetType.GetInterfaces has typeofIDictionary in the results. I wont know and shouldnt need to know the dictionary key type or the value type.p  pMy current need is to process something that is codeDictionaryltstring, SomeClassgtcode. Once I get the list of keys I can use a foreach on each instance, figure out that its a string and proceed from there. With the Values itll be an instance of some class the class will change but again, I can pass that off to another set of methods to extract the class, extract the properties of the class and extract those values.p  pThe main point of the request is to obtain a method or two or however many that will allow me to iterate over a dictionary of unknown types and extract the keys and values, all without knowing the types at compile time. The above Dictionary is just an example, I need to be able to pass any dictionary. At the moment, Im not worried about edge cases like codeDictionaryltTupleltint, string, SomeOtherClassgt, SomeClassgtgtcode or things like that, if I can start with codeDictionaryltstring, SomeClassgtcode, I can probably proceed from there.p  pIts getting the keys and values out in a form that I can process that I havent figured out how to do yet.p

Hence we need to know if to go ahead with the same or shift to a more widely adopted stack like HTML, CSS and JS.p  pThe data is served using a locally deployed web serversyncs with cloud from time to time which serves data using the recommendation and search engine. We use Qt Quick for both getting data using AJAX and the UI is made using QMLs elements, Touch Events, Animations, State  Transitions. We are left with very basic operations in C which read configuration files, etc. p  pWe had developed a prototype 2 years ago in HTML5 using Sencha and were not very happy with the performance and touch behaviour, hence we picked Qt. But because it is much harder to develop beautiful looking apps in a fast development cycle on Qt, stylesheeting is extremely naive on Qt, I want to reconsider if to move from Qt back to HTML5 or think of another framework. You can safely assume we want to deploy across Windows and Android. p

Negative 43976 pI have a php script, which can be run independently from the command line, so its first line is codeusrbinenv phpcode. However, I also have another script, which can automatically run the first one. It does this by calling codeinclude example.phpcode, which works, except that it outputs the first line as text.p  pHow do I make include skip the first line So far the only options I could think of were to wrap the whole thing in an output buffer and then trim the first line, but that has a whole host of problems with it. Alternatives such as using codeexeccode to simulate running the second script from the command line, or reading in the whole file and evaluating it with codeevalcode, both seem like pretty horrible solutions.p  pIs there any way to tell php, include this file but dont output the first linep  pI am aware I can just remove the shebang and run the script with codephp script.phpcode whenever I need to use it, which is ok in this specific case, but I would still like to know if there is an alternative, general way to make include ignore the first or first X lines.p

Negative 43976 pI wish to setup one of my columns in my DataGridView in such a way that than when the user edits a cell in this column, a DateTime Picker appears.

Negative 43976 pSuppose there is a production line with 8 tanks each filled with a different substance for parts to be dipped in. The parts will be dropped into tanks by a crane along side the tanks. Each part moving through the tanks has a recipe associated with it. That is, each a part with recipe 1 must be in tank 1 for 10 seconds and tank 2 for 5 seconds and so on. Also each part must be dipped in each tank in the order of the tank numbers code1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8code. p  pFurther suppose that each part cannot sit in a tank for more than the time specified in the recipe for that part and the travel time of the crane is instantaneous. For example if a part is in tank 2 for 10 seconds and the next part scheduled to enter tank 1 only is supposed to be in tank 1 for 5 seconds then that part will not be put in tank 1 because it would then have to wait in tank 1 for 5 seconds longer than the recipe specified. Instead the crane must wait to put a new part in tank 1 until it is guaranteed to not have any wait time moving between tanks.p  pNow if you have say 50 parts with recipe 1, 50 with recipe 2, and 50 with recipe 3 then what is the optimal way to add parts into the tanks code1,1,1,2,3,2,1,3...code or maybe all parts with recipe 1 first then a mix of parts 2 and 3 My most promising thought on maybe solving this problem is to use a shortest path algorithm which I dont have much experience with, but Dijkstras algorithm looked promising. I would build a tree where the root node is the first part put on the line and each child represents the next part to be put in the tanks. If you start with a part using recipe 1 then you can think of it as the root node with three children code1,2,3code one for each type of recipe. Similarly each of those child nodes would have three children code1,2,3code and so on down the line until youve run out of parts to add to the tree. The distance between a parent  and its child would then be how long, based on the parents recipe, that the child has to wait outside the tanks before it can enter and safely move through the tanks with no delays.p  pThe problem with this method, however, is that there are code150503  21064code distinct orders of part which would make it quite difficult to store in any kind of data structure or process it in a reasonable way. What other approaches could I take to solve this problem Is a definitive optimal order of parts even obtainable or would I have to settle for an approximationp

Negative 43976 pJSFiddle at the bottomp  pIn an application Im developing, the user can map jQuery UI draggable items from a flat list onto a tree where the leaf nodes are jQuery UI droppables. The items from the flat list can be mapped one by one, but a user can also use multiselect to grab an arbitrary number of items and drop them onto the same droppable in one go.p  pWhen the user selects a large number of items, the draggable helper becomes pretty long. This causes problems when trying to drop the items on a node that is near the bottom of the tree.p  pThe behavior Im after is to drop the items on the leaf node droppable that the mouse cursor is currently on. This seems to work in all cases except for when you reach the bottom of the list. The cursor will move down but the draggable will stay where it is it cant go any further. Instead of dropping on the droppable that the mouse cursor is on, the draggable will be dropped on the droppable that is below where the mouse cursor emis expected to be based on the cursorAt attribute, or at least so it seemsem.p  pI have tried a number of settings and alterations but I cannot get a grip on this behavior. Most solutions I find using search point to the codetolerance pointercode setting on the droppable, but I already use that and it doesnt fix the problem. My helper clones the draggable and sets pointerevents none on it, but that doesnt seem to matter either I can just as well remove the helper function and the behavior is the same.p  pIs this a bug Is there a way to fix it Help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if more info is needed. Thanksp  pJSFiddle reproducing the problem a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net1odvbmah4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net1odvbmah4ap  pEdit Disclaimer The JSFiddle is the simplest way I could reproduce the problem. Therefore, some things dont exactly work as in the real case. I stuck the droppable container on the bottom to restrict the draggable. In the real case, the list of droppables is scrollable but the draggable cant go beyond the bottom of that list. The resulting behavior is exactly the same. So a small CSS change is not a fix for my real problem p  pSecond edit changing the codecursorAtcode value is not the solution either.

Ive included my code below.  These are the errors which Ive run into navigating to sites like www.google.com, news.bbc.co.uk, and here, of course.p  ol liThe first exception  Exception in Safecall method  occurs as my form first displays, before naviagting anywhere at all.  I have a workaround in the form of a TApplication.OnException handler.li ol  pMy q is a Does anyone know how to avoid it in the first place or b is there a tidier way of catching it than setting up a TApplication.Exception handler, which always feels to me like a bit of an admission of defeat I mean having one to avoid the user seeing an exception, not having an applicationwide handler at all.  p  pThis exception occurs in this codep  precodeprocedure TCustomGeckoBrowser.Paint var   rc TRect   baseWin nsIBaseWindow begin   if csDesigning in ComponentState then   begin     rc  ClientRect     Canvas.FillRectrc   end else   begin     baseWin  FWebBrowser as nsIBaseWindow     baseWin.RepaintTrue   end   inherited end codepre  pin the call to baseWin.Repaint, so presumably its presumably coming from the other side of the interface.  I only get it the first time .Paint is called.  I noticed that at that point, the baseWin returns False for GetVisibility, hence the experimental code in my TForm1.Loaded, to see if that would avoid it. It does not.p  p2.a After calling GeckoBrowser1.LoadURI, I get Invalid floating point operation once or more depending on the URL being loaded.p  p2.b Again, depending on the URL, I get Access violation at address 556318B3 in module js3250.dll.  Read of address 00000008. or similar.  On some pages it occurs every few seconds thanks I imagine to some JS timer code in the page.p  p2a amp 2b are avoided by the call to Set8087CW in TForm1.OnCreate below but Im mentioning them mainly in case anyone recognises them and 1 together as symptomatic of a systemic problem of some sort, but also so google will find this q for others who run into those symptoms.p  pReverting to my q 1b, the Exception in Safecall method occurs from StdWndProc TWinControl.MainWndProc[...]TCustomGeckoBrowser.Paint.  Instead of using an TApplication.OnException handler, is there a way of catching the exception further up the callchain, so as to avoid modifying the code of TCustomGeckoBrowser.Paint by putting a handler in therep  pbUpdate bA comment drew my attention to this documentation relating to SafeCallp  piESafecallException is raised when the safecall error handler has not been set up and a safecall routine returns a non0 HResult, or if the safecall error handler does not raise an exception. If this exception occurs, the Comobj unit is probably missing from the applications uses list Delphi or not included in the project source file C. You may want to consider removing the safecall calling convention from the routine that gave rise to the exception.ip  pThe GeckoBrowser source comes with a unit, BrowserSupports, which looks like a type library import unit, except that it seems to have been manually prepared.  It contains an interface which includes the Repaint method which is producing the SafeCall exception.p  precode  nsIBaseWindow  interfacensISupports   [046bc8a0801511d3af7000a024ffc08c]     procedure InitWindowparentNativeWindow nativeWindow parentWidget nsIWidget x PRInt32 y PRInt32 cx PRInt32 cy PRInt32 safecall     procedure Create safecall     procedure Destroy safecall   [...]     procedure Repaintforce PRBool safecall   [...]   end codepre  pFollowing the suggestion in the quoyed documentation, I changed th safecall to StdCall on the Repaint member but only that member and, presto, the exception stopped occurring.

Negative 43976 pIm trying to run a codeSELECT codestyle query in Slick against a view. Ideally, Id end up with a function that you can pass a set of column names as a codeSeq[String]code and itd execute the query codeSELECT col1, col2, ... FROM viewcode. If thats not feasible then itd be acceptable to just return all columns codeSELECT  FROM viewcode.p  pI know I could do this by defining a codeTablecode class for this view as well as an accompanying case class, but some of these views have hundreds of columns which would require nested tuples, given that theres a 22 element limit on tuples, and there are many views Id have to do this for, so thats a lot of code to writegeneratemaintain. Id like to avoid that if at all possible.p  pIs this doable in Slick Either by defining a codeTablecode class without having to define columns in static code initializing some class with a dynamic column string list would be acceptable, or by just generating a SQL query ourselves using codesql...code and somehow getting code.as[...]code to handle returning a set of columns of arbitrary lengthp  pI dont need to do anything special with the actual column types on the database side weve got a mixture of types, but if theyre all treated as text columns on the Slick side thatd be fine with me.p

Negative 43976 pI am trying to create a library, which only has one public function, which returns an enum.  The private function, that powers this based on my requirements, has to be async due to android platform.  What I want to do, is make the only public function be consumed as a nonasync function.  I know this may see counterintuitive, but I have my reasons.  As far as the consumer of the function is concerned, they have always had to run the code as synchronous before, and this requirement does not change now that it is wrapped in a more efficient library.  I dont want to make them do await method.  They dont have to know, that is what is going on behind the scenes.p  pHere is what I have so far, but I am struggling with the public methodp  precodepublic enum DialogResult      Button1  1,     Button2  2,     Button3  3,   class MsgBox      public  DialogResult ShowString Title, String Caption, Context context                  private async TaskltDialogResultgt ShowAsyncString Title, String Caption, Context context              return await BuildAsyncTitle, Caption, context           private TaskltDialogResultgt BuildAsyncString Title, String Caption,Context context              var r  new TaskCompletionSourceltDialogResultgt          new AlertDialog.Buildercontext         .SetPositiveButtonYes, sender, args gt                       User pressed yes             r.SetResultDialogResult.Button1                  .SetNegativeButtonNo, sender, args gt                       Do nothing             r.SetResultDialogResult.Button2                   .SetMessageCaption         .SetTitleTitle         .Show          return r.Task         codepre  pIn summary I need this public function to just return my plain DialogResult once it has returned from ShowAsync, and not require itself to be called with await.p

Ive managed to create a working registerlogin demo website which works well using the U2F tokens and the U2F Chrome extension.p  pHowever... and this is where my question arises Ive also enrolled a security key for my Google account and immediately got struck by the fact that it works without using the U2F Chrome extension. As a matter of fact Ive done all the Google enrollment and logins without even having the extension installed. How is this possible Ive read some of the FIDO specifications and saw that there may be two API levels high  which is the u2f namespace exposed by the extension and  and low  which involves using MessagePort API. Maybe this is how Google does it also tried doing a chrome.runtime.connect... myself, but the chrome.runtime object is undefined in my web pagep  pAny pointer in the proper direction would be appreciated and of great value at this moment, as there arent many resources available on this young project called U2F.p

Negative 43976 pI understand that modern operation systems provide apis for debugging. When a debugger process asks the kernel to set a breakpoint on machine code instruction of another process, the kernel replaces the first byte of the instruction with an opcode that causes an interrupt.p  pThe interrupt handler would halt the process, save the registers and notify the debugging process.p  pWhat I do not understand is what exactly happens on out of order execution processors. The interrupt instruction could be executed before its predecessors or after its ancestors and thus, at the time of the interrupt, the registers and memory will contain wrong values.p

Negative 43976 pThis is my first post. I have been teaching myself Prolog for a university project and I am tasked with generating a program that simulates the lotto and compares the random numbers 6 in this case with the numbers that the user has. If they all match then you are deemed the winner if not, then it returns hard luck. p  pAll I have been able to do so far is generate one random number in the range of 150. I dont know how to do much else after that.  p  blockquote   p usemodulelibraryrandom.p      p random1,50,Out.p blockquote  pI understand I have to add the random number to a list, but Im not sure how to implement it. And to then have another list of numbers usernumbers in the database or factbase. Then use SWIProlog to check if theyre equal. p  pIt is a really tough program for me to try and do in Prolog, especially seeing as I am teaching it to myself. If anybody could give me some pointers on how to approach it I would be very grateful. p

Negative 43976 h2Backgroundh2  pI inherited quite a bit of Excel VBA code that was wonky and ran slowly.  The code simulates user input into a report thousands of times and then generates an output file to be sent to some other users.  I made great strides in performance thus far by eliminating copypaste, by working within arrays instead of accessing the sheets and cells directly, by removing unnecessary code, and by reworking many volatile formulas into something better.p  pPrior to my changes, running this report to simulate user input would take around 65 seconds per user and there are roughly 4,300 users.  That comes out to 279,500 seconds roughly 77.6 hours.  That is assuming a constant speed, the same speed at which the macro begins.  This is not the case at all.  In reality, the macro slows considerably as it processes overnight and on, to the point where it is taking well over 120 seconds per user.p  h2Problemh2  pFollowing my code cleanup and performance improvements I got the macro to start at around 10 seconds per user, which is an excellent speed.  I let the macro run overnight last night and came in this morning to see it is now taking around 90 seconds per user, so I am experiencing a large degradation in performance overnight.p  pstrongMy question is  How can I prevent this slowdown from occurring as the macro runs over timestrongp  h2Researchh2  pI am not without an idea.  Currently, my thoughts are that I would need to close and reopen the Excel workbooks because they are getting bogged down in garbage.  One idea I have is to perhaps use a native VB.NET application to open the Excel workbook and run the macros.  Every 500 or so users I could write the relevant variables somewhere in cells in the workbook, save and close the workbook, and then reopen it to pick up where I left off.  That doesnt seem very elegant to me.  Additionally, it may be difficult to convince others I need to introduce a new technology VB.NET.  People are weird about that, and prefer a native VBA solution.p  pIs there a better way to manage Excel so that I dont have to create a new VB.NET application and do the savingclosingopeningp  pI would like to add there is no specific offending code, it simply slows down still works as time goes on.p

I recently bought a Lumia 635 with FWVGA resolution and something is wrong with touch locations. I read online that the resolution of the screen is a bit bigger than a standard WVGA 800x480 vs 854x480. Game sprites ad other thing are handled correctly, but I tried stepping through the debugger and the backbuffer sizes are 800x480, which is right if you remove the navigation bar size. But the TouchLocations are calculated using the full display resolution. Is there some kind of hack to fix this thingp

Negative 43976 pI was doing some benchmarking today using C and OpenTK, just to see how much I could actually render before the framerate dropped. The numbers I got were pretty astronomical, and I am quite happy with the outcome of my tests.p  pIn my project I am loading the blender monkey, which is 968 triangles. I then instance it and render it 100 times. This means that I am rendering 96,800 triangles per frame. This number far exceeds anything that I would need to render during any given scene in my game. And after this I pushed it even further and rendered 2000 monkeys at varying locations. I was now rendering a whopping 1,936,000 almost 2 million triangles per frame and the framerate was still locked at 60 frames per second That number just blew my mind. I pushed it even further and finally the framerate started to drop, but this just means that the limit is roughly 4 million triangles per frame with instancing.p  pI was just wondering though, because I am using some legacy OpenGL, if this could still be pushed even furtheror should I even botherp  pFor my tests I load the blender monkey model, store it into a display list using the deprecated calls likep  precodemodelMeshID  MeshGenerator.Generate delegate              GL.Begin PrimitiveType.Triangles              foreach Face f in model.Faces                   foreach ModelVertex p in f.Points                       Vector3 v  model.Vertices[ p.Vertex ]                     Vector3 n  model.Normals[ p.Normal ]                     Vector2 tc  model.TexCoords[ p.TexCoord ]                     GL.Normal3 n.X , n.Y , n.Z                      GL.TexCoord2 tc.Y , tc.X                      GL.Vertex3 v.X , v.Y , v.Z                                            GL.End           codepre  pand then call that list x amount of times. strongMy question though, is if I could speed this up if I threw VAOs Vertex Array Objects into the display list instead of the old GL.Vertex3 apistrong Would this effect performance at all Or would it create the same outcome with the display listp  pHere is a screen grab of a few thousandp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comraIrY.png altenter image description herep  pMy system specsp  precodeCPU AMD Athlon IIx4quad core 620 2.60 GHz Graphics Card AMD Radeon HD 6800 codepre

Negative 43976 pI have been running a regular Django site using the regular EB Python platform, but for some reasons, I want to migrate to using a Docker image, but still get everything I get from Elastic Beanstalk. In order to demonstrate the problem, I created a small Django project at a hrefhttpsgithub.comdkarchmerawsebdockerdjango relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdkarchmerawsebdockerdjangoa which works on both Python 2.7 and 3.4, and it is a simplified version of my real site. Anyway, I will be happy getting this to work with either the Preconfigured Docker Platform, or with a generic Docker platform. My Google searches have only found the super simple, Flask based example that AWS shows, and a couple of questions on Stackoverflow, but it almost seems like nobody is trying to put a Django project on EBDocker. Anyway, lets start with a generic solution, which is my preferred option. If you download the Github project, you can successfully use docker or better, dockersompose to test that the image works when run locally I am running on a MacOS.  It is not clear if I should use a CMD to define specify my python manage.py runserver or if I need an ENTRYPOINT, or if I need to use uswgi as the preconfigured solution does.

Negative 43976 pI am trying to complete a matlab assignment project with the following questionp  pWrite a function called movingaverage that takes a scalar called x as an input argument and returns a scalar. The function uses a buffer to hold previous inputs, and the buffer can hold a maximum of 25 inputs. Specifically, the function must save the most recent 25 inputs in a vector the buffer. Each time the function is called, it copies the input argument into an element of the buffer. If there are already 25 inputs stored in the buffer, it discards the oldest element and saves the current one in the buffer. After it has stored the input in the buffer, it returns the mean of all the elements in the buffer.p  pThe solution I provide is the followingp  precodefunction ma  movingaverage x     persistent buffer     if isemptybuffer         buffer  x ma  meanx     else buffer  [buffer x]         if numelbuffer lt 25             ma  meanbuffer          else             ma  mean[bufferend24 bufferend]         end     end codepre  pAccording to the auto grader my function performs correctly when values 150 are passing consecutively, but fails when values of a noisy sine wave are passing consecutively which I have been informed that might be due to some sort of a round off error.p  pI would be grateful if any of you could provide me some hints regarding the possible error steps in my code appended above.p  pThank you in advance p
Negative 43976 pIve got the following problem There are the Activities A, B, C and D. Each Activity of B, C and D contain a list of items.p  pNow lets start at A From A i want to go to Activity D to select an Item and put it in somewhere in A. But to get from A to D Ive got to go through B and C. That is because B, C and D represent a tree of objects.p  pSo I start the activities the following way A  B  C  D in the end I want to pass the item from D to A.p  pUp to that my code is working correctlyp  pBut Imagine the user chose the wrong item in Activity C. Therefore he will get the false list in Activity D. What would the user do The user would go back to C, choose the correct item, so the correct list in D will be shown. Then the user will choose the wanted item in D, which shall be passed back to Activity A.p  pThat doesnt work. So whenever the user uses the backbutton to get one level back in the tree, the code doesnt work anymore.p  pSpecifically it doesnt work because if I went back from D to C the Activity C does not have a calling Activity anymore actvityC.getCallingActivity is null.p  pTo go from A to B I use startActivityForResult. To go from B to C and from C to D I use startActivity and Intent.FLAGACTIVITYFORWARDRESULT.p  pI hope you understand my problem and can help me.p  pGreetingsp  pedited typo removedp

Negative 43976 pstrongWhat Im Trying To Achievestrongp  pWe have a table within our database called empstatsem that focuses on reserving a person record for one user at a time. This table holds a record for each person and adds a users UNIQUE ID and places it in emlockedbyem field to reserve it, otherwise its 0 when unlocked.  This allows only the user to edit this record whilst open in their software, when the software window closes the software releases the record by setting the associated person record emlockedbyem field to 0, thus allowing another user to edit it if they please. p  pThe problem I appear to be having is that there is a report or procedure that keeps leaving records locked to one user and thus preventing others to access these person records. This is something I am working to resolve separately.p  pIn meantime as the symptoms are quite obvious when you query the empstatsem table with p  precodeselect  From pstats where lockedby  0 codepre  pAs one of the users ID is in like 30, 40, 50 person records emlockedbyem field, for example p  precodepcode       lockedby  100212        100025 100304        100025 100810        100025 100835        100025 100980        100025 117092        100025 117472        100025 117907        100025 codepre  pstrongThe Code I Am Executingstrongp  pTo try and offer some relief to this i can manually set individual records by using p  precodeUpdate sysDatabase.dbo.pstats set lockedby  0 where pcode  100212 codepre  pAs you can imagine this is rather time consuming when there are 30 records to amend and takes time away from resolving the source of this problem.

When the tests are running against the remote Wildfly container everything works fine, however when running against the remote Glassfish container the tests fail with a series of errors.p  pThe Maven output reports an internal server error and also shows that the test failed due to a codeNullPointerExceptioncode but I believe this is actually a result of the Shrinkwrap deployment not being deployed to the Glassfish container rather than an error in the code itself.p  pThe Glassfish server log shows no sign of anything being deployed to the container but there is a codeTimeoutExceptioncode recorded in the log file when the integration test is run.p  pWhat I dont understand is what Im doing wrong that prevents the test running against a remote Glassfish 4.1 container. Given that the same test passes without any problems on a remote Wildfly 8.2 container, I believe the problem lies with the Arquillian configuration in my project rather than the code being tested.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After some further investigation this appears to be a very specific problem with Glassfish 4.1 where secure admin HTTPS has been enabled. If I run the test on a Glassfish 4.1 container with secure admin disabled then the test succeeds. If I run the test on a Glassfish 4.0 container with secure admin enabled then the test also succeeds. Unfortunately Glassfish requires secure admin to be enabled to deploy to a container running on another host, so the only workaround I can see at the moment is to downgrade to Glassfish 4.0.p  pThe

Negative 43976 pI have an issue with creatingusing RSA keys created and used in PHP. Problem is, that the public AND private keys should be exchanged between different servers e.g. when a user account is moved.p  pNow, the openssllib of PHP does not provide any detailed info on in what format the keys are created. The latest documentation at a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.opensslpkeyexport.php relnofollowhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.opensslpkeyexport.phpa just states, that it is in PEM format, but it does not say whether it is in PKCS1 or PKCS8p  pAdditionally, the headers and trailers of the private key PEM differ between PHP versions as the following code demonstratesp  precodeltphp config  array     digestalg gt sha512,         privatekeybits gt 4096,     privatekeytype gt OPENSSLKEYTYPERSA  keyPair  opensslpkeynewconfig privateKey  NULL opensslpkeyexportkeyPair, privateKey vardumpprivateKey keyDetails  opensslpkeygetdetailskeyPair publicKey  keyDetails[key] vardumppublicKey die gt codepre  pwill output different stuffp  pPHP v 5.4p  precodestring3272 BEGIN PRIVATE KEY MIIJRAIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCCS4wggkqA... END PRIVATE KEY   string800 BEGIN PUBLIC KEY MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAO... END PUBLIC KEY  codepre  pPHP v 5.5p  precodestring3272 BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY MIIJRAIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCCS4wggkqA... END RSA PRIVATE KEY   string800 BEGIN PUBLIC KEY MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAO... END PUBLIC KEY  codepre  pPHP v 5.6p  precodestring3272 BEGIN PRIVATE KEY  MIIJQgIBADANBggsdisdVUCJDSQCjqgl2XqzRbSv... END PRIVATE KEY   string800 BEGIN PUBLIC KEY  MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BsdvQEFAAOdfAg8AMIICFAgEAo6oJdl6s0fm0r7QlaNU... END PUBLIC KEY   codepre  pSo the private key headertrailer changes based on what PHP version you use. This wouldnt be a real problem, but as it turns out, a system which would create a key header WITH RSA will not be able to user key WITHOUT RSA for e.g., opensslsign Youll get an error stating that the provided key couldnt be coerced into a private key... And this is where it gets messy.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstls.mbed.orgkbcryptographyasn1keystructuresinderandpem relnofollowhttpstls.mbed.orgkbcryptographyasn1keystructuresinderandpema, there should be a distinction between Private key PEM formats with the RSA in the header an those without, being PKCS1 and PKCS8, i.e. with additinal info about the algorithm etc. or not.p  pI am running into serious problems due to this. The same software written for PHP5.6 cannot run on PHP5.5. On could use a workaround by replacing the 5.5headers with 5.6compatible ones manually, but this would just be a dirty hack. Is there a good way how to deal with thisp  pAt setup, this replacementcode would attempt to create a private key, extract the header and remember it. All keys used at runtime would then be checked. If the headers found would not fit to the local ones, they would need to be exchanged.p  pBut I guess there is some kind of configuration option which I havent managed to find yet where I can configure which format is usedp  pNext, more interesting question What format is created exactly by openssl PKCS1 PKCS8 Is this also configurablep

Negative 43976 pIm trying to make a menu. Im not using a ComboBox or a ContextMenu, but Im using a pane, in which ill add an HBox most probably.p  pMy application is made in a BorderPane. In its left region a navigation menu, always on. In its top, a header, with a search field, maximize window button, close button, and notification button. In its center, a changing page, the app window so to say. All that is designed in SceneBuilderp  pWhen clicking on that notification button, in the TOP region of the border pane, Id need to display my menu pane, all across the app, ABOVE the center region. Ive tried many different ways already, none giving resultsp  ul liModify the panes height, from 0 to full height The pane displays, but behind the CENTER REGIONli lipMade the pane at correct height already, and when clicking on the buttonp  pborderPane.getTop.toFrontp  pThat just kills the whole app, making the TOP region to float above the whole, and the CENTER region to expend under the TOP region, very weirdpli lipTried to play with borderPane.getCenter.toBack, so that the always drawn menu would appear when the center goes behind it. That works, but only once, as sending a region of a borderPane toFronttoBack gets it out of the borderPane somehow and trying to access that region again always returns nullpli liAnd other ways that all do include toFront and toBack.li ul  pWhile searching for a solution I found out, that if I use a ContextMenu on that button, the menu appearing would show above everything. Same goes if I trigger a ComboBox in the TOP region, the content also shows by default above the CENTER region.p  pSo, Im kindly asking any generous soul what the solution would be. Maybe how to mimic the ContextMenuComboBox behavior that does display above everythingp

Negative 43976 pAt many places, I get several Checked Exceptions like IOException, ParseException, JSONException, etc. I had to make either of 2 choices p  ol lipThrow the same exception by adding throws at the end of method signature.pli lipWrap the checked Exception in a RuntimeExceptionor some custom implementation and then throw it so that caller doesnt have to add throws clause everywhere and check the exceptions.pli ol  pIn the first case, I will have to put throws everywhere, but my client can decide not to die by catching the checkedException and continuing to work. In 2nd case, however the RuntimeException may actually force the client to fail, as generally people dont catch GenericRuntimeExceptions everywhere. Also using 2nd approach makes it easier to use Java 8 lambdas which doesnt work well with Checked Exceptions.p  pWhich one of the two is preferred over another and why Is there any preferred practice to followp
