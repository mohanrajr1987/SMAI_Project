Positive 57129 pThis is largely an emam I doing it right  how can I do this betterem kind of topic, with some concrete questions at the end. If you have other advice  remarks on the text below, even if I didnt specifically ask those questions, feel free to comment.p  hr  pI have a MySQL table for users of my app that, along with a set of fixed columns, also has a text column containing a JSON config object. This is to store variable configuration data that cannot be stored in separate columns because it has different properties per user. There doesnt need to be any lookup  ordering  anything on the configuration data, so we decided this would be the best way to go.p  pWhen querying the database from my Node.JS app running on Node 0.12.4, I assign the JSON text to an object and then use Object.defineProperty to create a getter property that parses the JSON string data when it is needed and adds it to the object.p  pThe code looks like thisp  precodeuser       uid results[0].uid     c results[0].userconfig  JSON config data as string  Object.defineProperty user, config,     get gt         c  JSON.parse c if not c         return c codepre  pstrongEditstrong above code is Coffeescript, heres the approximate Javascript equivalent for those of you who dont use Coffeescriptp  precodevar user       uid results[0].uid,     c results[0].userconfig  JSON config data as string   Object.definePropertyuser, config,      get function          ifthis.c  undefined             this.c  JSON.parsethis.c                  return this.c       codepre  pI implemented it this way because parsing JSON blocks the Node event loop, and the config property is only needed about half the time this is in a middleware function for an express server so this way the JSON would only be parsed when it is actually needed. The config data itself can range from 5 to around 50 different properties organised in a couple of nested objects, not a huge amount of data but still more than just a few lines of JSON.p  pAdditionally, there are three of these JSON objects I only showed one since theyre all basically the same, just with different data in them. Each one is needed in different scenarios but all of the scenarios depend on variables some of which come from external sources so at the point of this function its impossible to know which ones will be necessary.p  pSo I had a couple of questions about this approach that I hope you guys can answer.p  ul lipIs there a negative performance impact when using codeObject.definePropertycode, and if yes, is it possible that it could negate the benefit from not parsing the JSON data right awaypli lipAm I correct in assuming that not parsing the JSON right away will actually improve performance Were looking at a continuously high number of requests and we need to process these quickly and efficiently.pli lipRight now the three JSON data sets come from two different tables JOINed in an SQL query. This is to only have to do one query per request instead of up to four. Keeping in mind that there are scenarios where none of the JSON data is needed, but also scenarios where all three data sets are needed and of course scenarios inbetween, could it be an improvement to only get the required JSON data from its table, at the point when one of the data sets is actually needed I avoided this because I feel like waiting for four separate SELECT queries to be executed would take longer than waiting for one query with two JOINed tables.pli lipAre there other ways to approach this that would improve the general performance even more I know, this ones a bit of a subjective question, but ideas  suggestions of things I should check out are welcome. Im not looking to spin off parsing the JSON data into a separate thread though, because as our service runs on a cluster of virtualised singlecore servers, creating a child process would only increase overall CPU usage, which at high loads would have even more negative impact on performance.pli ul  pemNote when I say performance it mainly means fast and efficient throughput rates. We prefer a somewhat larger memory footprint over heavier CPU usage.emp

The Dashing widget Ive created for this is very similar to the default List widget that comes with Dashing.p  pI intend to display this using a Raspberry Pi outputting HDMI to a TV in my office.

Negative 57129 pIm looking for some strategies regarding accessing some cached data that resides in a internal company web service.  Actually, preventing access of the cached data while the cache is being refreshed. p  pWe have a .Net 3.5 C web service running on a web farm that maintains a cache of a halfdozen or so datasets.  This data is configuration associated items that are referenced by the real business logic domain that is also running in this web service as well as being returned for any client uses.  Probably talking a total of dozen or so tables with a few thousand records in them.p  pWe implemented a caching mechanism using the MS Enterprise Library 4.1.  No huge reason for using this over the ASP.Net cache except that we were already using Enterprise Library for some other things and we liked the cache expiration handling.  This is the first time that we have implemented some caching here so maybe Im missing something fundamentalp  pThis configuration data doesnt get changed too often  probably a couple of times a day.  When this configuration data does change we update the cache on the particular server the update request went to with the new data the update process goes through the web service.  For those other servers in the web farm currently a total of 3 servers, we have the cache expiration set to 15 minutes upon which the data is reloaded from the single database that all servers in the farm hit.  For our particular purposes, this delay between servers is acceptable although I guess not ideal.p  pDuring this refresh process, other requests could come in that require access to the data.  Since the request could come during an expirationrefresh process, there is no data currently in the cache, which obviously causes issues.p  pWhat are some strategies to resolve this  If this was going in a single domain sort of WinForm type of application we could hack something up that would prevent access during the refresh by the use of class variablesloops, threadingmutex, or some other singletonlike structure.  But Im leery on implementing something like that running on a web farm.  Should I be  Is a distributed server caching mechanism the way to go instead of each server having its own cache  I would like to avoid doing that for now if I could and come up with some coding to get around this problem.  Am I missing somethingp  pThanks for any input.p  pUPDATE I was going to use the Lock keyword functionality around the expiration action that subsequently refreshes the data, but I was worried about doing this on a web server.  I think that would have worked although it seems to me that there still would be a possibility although a lesser one that we could have grabbed data from the empty cache between the time it expired and the time the lock was entered the expiration action occurs on another thread I think.  So what we did was if there was no data in the cache during a regular request for data we assume that it is in the process of being refreshed and just grab the data from the source instead.  I think this will work since we can assume that the cache should be filled at all times since the initial cache filling process will occur when the singleton class that holds the cache is created when a web service request is first made.  So if the cache is empty it truly means that it is currently being filled, which normally only takes a few seconds so any requests for data from the cache during that time will be the only ones that arent hitting the cache.p  pIf anyone with experience would like to shed any more light on this, it would be appreciated.p

Negative 57129 pIt is a commonly held belief that the the C Standard library is not generally intended to be extended using inheritance. Certainly, I and others have criticised people who suggest deriving from classes such as codestdvectorcode.

Negative 57129 pIm trying to modify the default graph viewer of the Graph library because its user interface is awful just try dragging a node outside of the boundaries, youll seep  pThe basic setup is this there is a GraphCanvas control inherited from Panel which has children of Vertex and Edge control types. What I want to achieve isp  ul liGraphCanvas has scroll bars if the contents do not fit in the screenli liGraphCanvas can also be scrolled by dragging it just click on an empty space and dragli liGraphCanvas can be zoomed in and out via CTRLmouse wheelli liVertices can be dragged around. If a vertex is dragged outside the current boundaries of GraphCanvas, the boundaries are increased. The scroll bars should reflect this, however the current viewport should not scroll away while the vertex is being dragged . The same goes if dragging a vertex reduces the boundaries of GraphCanvas  it should stay the same size until the drag operation is finished and resize only then. Automatically scrolling the viewport during a drag operation is awfully confusing and easily introduces dragging errors. See the original implementation if you want to know what I mean.li ul  pAlthough Ive got a fair bit of experience with .NET, Im still a complete beginner in WPF. My current attempt is in the measurearrange layout phase to give each vertext the XY coordinate it desires even if negative and implement zoomingscrolling by handling mouse events on the GraphCanvas and modifying the RenderTransform property. Dragging just changes the XY coordinates on the specific vertex probably triggering the relayout of the whole thing which would be nice to avoid too. Scrollbars are implemented by placing the GraphCanvas inside a ScrollViewer and implementing IScrollInfo on the GraphCanvas.p  pUnfortunately there seems to be a problem I can get mouse events on the GraphCanvas itself only if it has a background at the point. That would be OK, I want a white background anyway, but in the negative coordinates of the GraphCanvas it does not draw the background  and thus does not respond to mouse events.p  pIm also wondering if Im doing the Right Thing by allowing all my child controls vertices and edges to go into negative coordinates. How would you implement this hr strongAddedstrong To clarify about the background problem check out the following screenshot img srchttpvalts.21.lvproblemGraphCanvas.pngp  pWhat you see here is a simple Windows Forms form with a WPF Host control on it. That has a ScrollViewer in it, and the ScrollViewer has the GraphCanvas in it. The GraphCanvas contains 4 vertices and 6 edges.p  pThe GraphCanvas is stretched to fill the ScrollViewer. But since some of the vertices are at negative coordinates, it has a RenderTransform applied which simply shifts everything to the right TranslateTransform. It also has a white background brush.p  pNote the gray area on the left. Thats still a part of the GraphCanvas, but the background brush somehow doesnt exted there. Also, if I leftclick there with my mouse not on a node, but on the gray area, I do strongNOTstrong get an event. If I leftclick on the white area, I get all events just fine.p
Negative 57129 pI have got an ActiveX Control that gets an image from a fingerprint device as base64 string. The Active works great and I could transfer the returned base64 string to the server to be converted to a binary data and then to be saved to a database. I use ASP.NET as server side technology and JavaScript as client side technology. The problem is that the base64 string is tool large and it would take from 30 to 40 seconds for the string to be transferred to the server. My question is Is there any way to compress this base64 string on client Browser and deflate it back on server. p
Negative 57129 pI am planning to implement a smallscale data acquisition system on an RTOS platform. Either on a QNX or an RTLinux system.p  pAs far as I know, these jobs are performed using C  C to get the most out of the system. However I am curious to know and want to learn some experienced peoples opinions before I blindly jump into the coding action whether it would be feasible and wiser to write everything in Python from lowlevel instrument interfacing through a shiny graphical user interface. If not, mixing with timingcritical parts of the design with C, or writing everything in C and not even putting a line of Python code.p  pOr at least wrapping the C code using Python to provide an easier access to the system. p  pWhich way would you advise me to work on I would be glad if you point some similar design cases and further readings as well.p  pThank youp  pstrongNOTE1strong The reason of emphasizing on QNX is due to we already have a QNX 4.25 based data acquisition system a hrefhttpwww.scieng.comprodutcsm300.htmM300a for our atmospheric measurement experiments. This is a proprietary system and we cant access the internals of it. Looking further on QNX might be advantageous to us since 6.4 has a free academic licensing option, comes with Python 2.5, and a recent GCC version. I have never tested a RTLinux system, dont know how comparable it to QNX in terms of stability and efficiency, but I know that all the members of Python habitat and nonPython tools like Google Earth that the new system could be developed on works most of the time outofthebox.p

Negative 57129 pThis is kind of repeated from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1444844canasystemaccessviolationexceptionhappenbecauseoffaultyrammy previous questiona, although the objective of my question is completely different now.p  pIm getting, now and then, about once a week, only in my development machine, a System.AccessViolationException in a web app I made.p  pSince my machine is having a few things that dont work quite well like a blue screen every now and then, I assumed before it might be faulty RAM. After 24 hours running memtest, im pretty sure its not...p  pSo, this is the situation This is a wep App, VB.Net 2.0, 100 managed code, doesnt use COM, Interop, or anything like that. Its running on a Windows Server 2008 SP2 box.br  The only strange thing Im doing is starting 3 threads of my own when the app starts, that do cron like stuff inside the appdomain, and also most of the requests this app is handling are handled asynchronously, and many of them are held open without a response for up to 30 seconds. Im doing Comet longpolling.p  pAlso, ive been working on this code for about a year now, and its only started to do this about a month ago. I cant think of anything major or important that I changed on this whole web app that I changed lately. Ive been working almost fully on the Javascript frontend.p  phr p  pWhen the exception happens, I get the typical popup asking me whether I want to debug. When I do, I see all the ASP.Net threads plus my 3 threads.br  My 3 threads are in a call to Sleep, which is normal. All the other ASP.Net threads have no call stack at all.br  In the thread where Visual Studio tells me I got the exception, I dont see anything.p  pSo I dont know for sure where the error happens, or even whether it happens every time in the same place or not.p  pAll I could find as a clue is this in the Application event logp  precodeFaulting application w3wp.exe, version 7.0.6002.18005, time stamp 0x49e03238,  faulting module unknown, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x00000000, exception code  0xc0000005, fault offset 0x0000000002358fe8, process id 0x1f4c, application  start time 0x01ca41395c564ed9. codepre  pAnd right after that, another event with this p  precodeAn unhandled exception occurred and the process was terminated.

Maybe thats the cause, but still, im not sure what to make of this...p  pI mean, this would place the problem completely out of my codebase, rightp  phr p  pstrongUPDATEstrong As suggested a hrefhttpforums.asp.nett1476904.aspx relnofollowherea, turning the App Pool integration to Classic seems to fix it. Im still looking for a decent solution, or at least an explanation, though.p

Negative 57129 pI have a custom project type based on the C Class Library project type in a VSX Package 2008.  For this project type, even though the output is a class library, I want to be able to debug this app just by pressing F5 etc.  I have a prebuilt executable that takes an assembly path as a commandline argument and loads it for workbench testing.p  pI can simulate this behavior manually by using the Projects Debug  Start Action  Start External Program in the property pages by providing the path to the executable and providing the relative path to the output dll as a command line argument.  But this is too much setup.  I would want the project types package code to be able to grab the assembly of the active configuration and the installed location of the workbench executable automatically.p  pThe worst case scenario would be that after every successful build, the property pages for that project are updated programmatically with the correct values.  I dont particularly like this solution because it seems messy, seems like it would be easy to get out of sync and expose those potential errors to the user.p  pThe best solution that I can imagine involved intercepting the Start Debugger event only for this project type before it craps out with A project with an Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly and executes the workbench instead debugger attached, of course.  I dont know if VSX exposes the necessary parts. p  pI would pay to have this simple  package along with a few other requirements, mainly a projectlevel menu item, already partially implemented written by someone with experience, but I havent found any consultants that specialize in VSX packages.  Recommendations are welcome.p  pAm I taking the wrong approach  Im assuming I need a package rather than an addin.p

For integers this can be easily donep  precode boolean validateint value, int min, int step, int max       return value gt min ampamp              value lt max ampamp               Step should be relative to the min value not to 0.              valuemin  step  0     codepre  pThis however doesnt work for double values. I know that this at least partly is for precision reasons and I tried hacking a solution by multiplying all the values by a very high number and convert them to longs. This didnt work for all the values though, and neither did allowing a small deviance from 0 when checking the remainder. Has anyone had this problem and come up with a good solution Below is an example and test featuring the nonworking validation method.p  pOne method of doing this would be to start at the min value and increment it by step until it is equal to or greater that the input value, but apart from beeing an ugly solution, this could be a potential bottleneck in my app, so I really want to avoid it.p  pIm grateful for any pointers...p  pRegards  Henrikp  precodepublic class ValidationExample   public static void mainString[] args  Range  min  10.5 step .3 max  5   Invalid values double[] a  11,10.6,10.4,10.3,10.1,10.0,9.8,9.7, 9.5,9.4,9.2,9.1,8.9,8.8,8.6,8.5,8.3, 8.2,8,7.9,7.7,7.6,7.4,7.3,7.1,7.0, 6.8,6.7,6.5,6.4,6.2,6.1,5.9,5.8,5.6, 5.5,5.3,5.2,5.0,4.9,4.8,2  Valid values double[] b  10.5,10.2,9.9,9.6,9.3,9.0,8.7,8.4, 8.1,7.8,7.5,7.2,6.9,6.6,6.3,6.0,5.7, 5.4,5.1  fordouble d  a ifvalidated,10.5,.3,5 System.err.printlnd   was considered valid.   fordouble d  b ifvalidated, 10.5,.3,5 System.err.printlnd   was considered invalid      Range   min  2    step .05    max  3    Invalid values double[] c  1.09,2.055,2.06,2.14,2.16,2.56,2.97,3.05  Valid values double[] e  2.0,2.05,2.1,2.15,2.2,2.25,2.5,2.75,2.95,3.0  fordouble d  c ifvalidated,2,.05,3 System.err.printlnd   was considered valid.   fordouble d  e ifvalidated,2,.05,3 System.err.printlnd   was considered invalid.     private static boolean  validatedouble value, double min, double step, double max return value gt min ampamp     value lt max ampamp    value  min  step  0  codepre  pp

Negative 57129 pI have n sectors, enumerated 0 to n1 counterclockwise. The boundaries between these sectors are infinite branches n of them. The sectors live in the complex plane, and for n even, sector 0 and n2 are bisected by the real axis, and the sectors are evenly spaced.p  pThese branches meet at certain points, called junctions. Each junction is adjacent to a subset of the sectors at least 3 of them. p  pSpecifying the junctions, in prefix order, lets say, starting from junction adjacent to sector 0 and 1, and the distance between the junctions, uniquely describes the tree.p  pNow, given such a representation, how can I see if it is symmetric wrt the real axisp  pFor example, n6, the tree 0,1,51,2,4,52,3,4 have three junctions on the real line, so it is symmetric wrt the real axis. If the distances between 015 and 1245 is equal to distance from 1245 to 234, this is also symmetric wrt the imaginary axis.p  pThe tree 0,1,51,2,52,4,52,3,4 have 4 junctions, and this is never symmetric wrt either imaginary or real axis, but it has 180 degrees rotation symmetry if the distance between the first two and the last two junctions in the representation are equal.p  pEdit  Here are all trees with 6 branches, distances 1. a hrefhttpwww2.math.su.seperfilesallTrees.pdf relnofollowhttpwww2.math.su.seperfilesallTrees.pdfap  pSo, given the descriptionrepresentation, I want to find some algorithm to decide if it is symmetric wrt real, imaginary, and rotation 180 degrees.

Negative 57129 pCurrently I am working on a school website, and we are still in the decisionmaking process of choosing a framework we know that were not using Joomla or handcoding. Drupal came up as a viable choice, and currently, that is my best bet for the site. However, I have an issue with CMSs in general. I would like to develop a quite complicated and specifically customsuited backend application for teachers to interact with individual students, including the design of sharedcustom calendars, announcement privileges, etc. I currently have a bit of expertise with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and I could wrap my head around some JavaScript and AJAX stuff if needbe. However, would such a complicated application work with Drupal in that I could create it to specifically suite my purposesp
Negative 57129 pI am just trying to program a simple drawing program. Along with drawing, I would like to know the points that I am currently touching. I am just using a window, subclassed viewController and a subclassed view.I also hid the status bar. Everything seems to work the way it is supposed to. The thing is that I cant get it to draw with my finger past any point of 470 on the yaxis. I can explicitly draw to the area. I draw a line from 0,480 to 320,480 and have no problems. When I drag my finger down, it stops short of the end of the screen at 470. On the way up, i can get events from 0,6 to 320,6 which doesnt make any sense to me. I think something might be shifted but every output of frame and bounds and the like says the same thing, Origin is at 0,0 and the wh is 320,480. Any idea on what I can do I am totally stuck. p  pThanks for any help you can give.p

Negative 57129 pwe are facing the following problem and we are trying to come up with the best possible solution.p  pWe are using SQL Server 2008. We have a table that has more than 600 millions records, and has about 25 columns. One of the columns is an ID and is indexed. We need to get a subset of records from this table. There are mainly 2 casesp  pa the subset contains anywhere between 1000 and 200 millions rows  the IDs of the rows to get are stored in an indexed table in SQL Serverp  pb the subset contains less than 1 million rows  the IDs of the rows to get are stored in the applications servers memory .NET web app.p  pOur challenge is to get this subset as fast as possible. We do need this to happen in a few seconds. p  pOur solutions so farp  pa we do a join between the two tables. That works but that is not fast enough. The query looks something like codeSELECT  FROM BigTable JOIN IndexTable ON BigTable.ID  IndexTable.IDcode.p  pb we do not really have a solution. We tried to run a WHERE IN query but that simply takes forever if the subset approaches the million rows codeSELECT  FROM BigTable WHERE ID IN ID1, ID2, ID3...code. A solution could be to store the indexes in a temporary table but then this falls back to case a.p  pWe are trying to optimize SQL Server as much as we can, notably using good indexes and partioning. I am more asking today of what you think the best approach is to extract the subset in both cases a and b.p  pAny idea or suggestion is appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 57129 pIm using the a hrefhttpsimple.sourceforge.nethome.phpSimple XML librarya to process XML files in my Android application. These file can get quite big  around 1Mb, and can be nested pretty deeply, so they are fairly complex.p  pWhen the app loads one of these files, via the Simple API, it can take up to 30sec to complete. Currently I am passing a FileInputStream into the [readClass, InputStream][2] method of Simples Persister class. Effectively it just reads the XML nodes and maps the data to instances of my model objects, replicating the XML tree structure in memory.p  pMy question then is how do I improve the performance on Android My current thought would be to read the contents of the file into a byte array, and pass a ByteArrayInputStream to the Persisters read method instead. I imagine the time to process the file would be quicker, but Im not sure if the time saved would be counteracted by the time taken to read the whole file first. Also memory constraints might be an issue.p  pIs this a fools errand Is there anything else I could do to increase the performance in this situation If not I will just have to resort to improving the feedback to the user on the progress of loading the file.p  pSome caveatsp  p1 I cant change the XML library Im using  the code in question is part of an engine which is used across desktop, mobile and web applications. The overhead to change it would be too much for the timebeing.p  p2 The data files are created by users so I dont have control over the sizedepth of nesting in them.p

Negative 57129 pI need to read a set of files and break it in to keyvalue pairs, and save these as a key,list of values for that key on disc, much like the mapreduce paradigm. Everything is on one computer though. I could for example write the different lists on different files and name the files with the key. That seems like a very poor way of doing things. To begin with if you have a billion keys, you will end up with a billion files. So obviously that is not going to work, and I will need some sort of memory mapping. I will also have to have different threads doing the map job, so if they were to write to this same buffer there is going to have to be some sort of synchronization between them. If I have a keyvalue buffer mapping, and synch over the buffers, then the threads shouldnt be stepping on each others toes, so I think that part should work. The question is how do I do the mapping of the values to disc. How do I write buffers that correspond to different keys in the same file If someone could point me in the right direction, it would be much appreciated. My knowledge of this area is quite pathetic. Thanks again.p

Negative 57129 pRecently I did introduce small changes in my codesfGuardUserProfilecode model added a decimal7,2 and yet another foreign key to codesfGuardUsercode. Code is working perfectly everywhere I need it.p  pIt seems however, that somewhere on the road I did trip. Now I cannot for the life of me make Symfony register a new user.

Negative 57129 pWe have a situation in front of us and its explained as belowp  ol liWe have durable subscriber subscribed to a topic. This durable subscriber is a perl script which is run by a daemon. li liThe perl script uses stomp to connect to the broker.li liThe perl script wakes up every 5 mins, checks for messages in the topic and processes them in a batch by prefetching the messages.li liThe subscriber uses a client acknowledgement and acknowledges only the last message of the batch.li liWe are using AMQ 5.5 with kahaDB persistence.li ol  pNow what we see is, p  ul liEven though the messages are processed in a batch and the last message is acknowledged the inflight count does not come down.li liEnqueue count, Dequeue count and Dispatch count do not match.li liThe journal files are not getting cleaned up.li ul  pI do understand that the journal files would be cleaned up once the references to the messages are lost or removed i.e. the messages are consumed.

Negative 57129 pThe only and imo very inconvenient caveat of codestdarraycode is that it cant deduce its size from the initializer list like builtin C arrays, its size must be passed as a template.p  pIs it possible to implement a stdarraylike container a thin wrapper around a builtin C array with a codeC11code initializerlistp  pI ask because, unlike stdarray, it would automatically deduce the size of the array from the initializer list which is a lot more convenient. For examplep  precode ilarray is the hypothetical container  automatically deduces its size from the initalizer list  ilarray ltintgt myarr  2, 4, 6, 7, 8  codepre  pWe would also want to provide a constructor to specify the size if an initializer list was not provided. For examplep  precode construct a fixed size array of size 10 ilarray ltintgt myarr2 10  codepre  pThis would also make the container more consistent with the other standard containers e.g. vector, deque and list.p  pTo the best of my knowledge it isnt possible as the wrapped Carray e.g. T elems [size], must have constant size and initializerlists size member function isnt constant.p  pAlso, I was wondering if was possible to implement such a container using a variadic template although from what Ive read I dont think its possible.p

Negative 57129 pIve written a custom MBean that deploys in Tomcat 6. One of its tasks is to query a database value. Im doing this by loading up the database resource using JNDI  the resource is defined in Tomcats server.xml. p  pThe problem is that when I create an instance of codejavax.naming.InitialContextcode it throws a codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode as it cant find codeorg.apache.naming.java.javaURLContextFactorycode.  This class is in codecatalina.jarcode and loaded by the common classloader. The jar containing my MBean code is loaded by a shared classloader. p  pAny ideas as to how I can get around thisp  pTo note my MBean is loaded by a ContextListener which Ive defined in the codetomcatconfweb.xmlcode. Ive also defined it in a webapp codeweb.xmlcode which makes no difference. I cant really move my jar so as to be loaded by the common classloader as it relies on classes loaded by the shared classloader.p  pThanks in advance, p  pWillp

Negative 57129 h1Short Questionh1  pI have a 50dip by 40dip button in my Android XML layout. What are the pixel dimensions of the drawable that I need to place in my mdpi resource folderp  h1Long Questionh1  pLets say I have a 50dip x 40dip button. p  precodeltButton     androidlayoutwidth50dip     androidlayoutheight40dip     androidbackgrounddrawablesomeImage gt codepre  pI am satisfied with the physical size of this button on my phone. My question is when Im designing someImage.png in Photoshop, how do I decide on the pixel dimensions of the image Currently, Im just making it a gigantic 500px by 400px image and placing it in the the default drawable resource folder because its working okay across all the phones and tablets Ive tested on. p  pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html relnofollowreference page on supporting multiple screensa does not tell me how to decide the  pixel dimensions. p  h2Problem 1  Baseline graphich2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compX0fk.png altenter image description herep  pThis diagram only tells me the relative dimensions of the graphics I need to put into each drawable resource folder. However, it does not tell me the pixel dimension I need to make my baseline mdpi graphic, from which all other graphics are relative to.p  h2Problem 2  screen density fragmentationh2  blockquote   pThe densityindependent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a   160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system   for a medium density screen. At runtime, the system transparently   handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual   density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen   pixels is simple px  dp  dpi  160. For example, on a 240 dpi   screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp   units when defining your applications UI, to ensure proper display of   your UI on screens with different densities.p blockquote  pThis little tidbit tells me that a 50dip wide graphic on a 160dpi screen will appear to be 50px wide. So great, you say. I should make my mdpi graphic 160dpi falls under mdpi 50px wide in Photoshop. Well, its not that simple, because not all mdpi phones are 160dpi. What if my mothers mdpi phone is 167dpi Then my 50dip wide graphic would appear as 52.1875px on her phone, which would likely cause some weird blurring artifacts. So what am I supposed to do Should I model my baseline mdpi off of my mothers 167dpi phone or should I model it off of the perfect laboratory 160dpi phone which maybe doesnt even exist in the real worldp

Negative 57129 pNotice the 2 queries below.  The 1st one does a union on 4 queries.  Im trying to write 2 for search conditions based on the 3 SQL variables prefixed with an .  So rather than doing a union, we have to take all 3 parameters into consideration for the search.  And if any parametervariable is  or NULL, just ignore that condition, but still perform the search.  But all fields have to combine with each other for a single rowrecord in the search results.p  pHow do I rewrite QUERY 2 so that it pulls results based on the search conditions companyName, primaryPhone and postalCode  I think each section in the where clause has to have some OR condition so it doesnt skip the row for a NULL search condition, but Im curious how this is typically done.  The primaryPhone part of the where clause is a little trickier because it looks at both phone and fax.p  pstrongQUERY 1strongp  precodeSELECT tempTable.optionValue, tempTable.optionText FROM

The final step should close the popup.p  pMy main problem is how can I make the popup AND the POST I can do a POST from the codebehind in my first site, but if I just display the resulting HTML in the popup window replacing its content or something, the browser still knows that the page came from the first site, so the next button click tries to go to the first site.

Negative 57129 pim new to infopath and need to ammend an existing infopath 2010 form. The users only want certain section groups to appear based on the users choice via checkboxes. Currently there are conditional rules in place for each group on the form which are working to hideshow the sections depending on whcih checkbox or checkboxes are selected.each checkbox relates to a group. There are 19 checkboxes and related groups, the users can select 1 or more groups. p  pThe problem is when users tick the checkbox , there is a delayed reaction seeing as there are so many condtional checks taking place on each click.The users dont like this. they would rather selct all the checkboxes they want , and then click a button to do all the work at onceinstead of on each checkbox. So ive been trying to programmatically access the groups from the code behind the buttons to hideshow them depending on which checkboxes are selected. Is it even possible to set the hideshow property of a group in the code behind  Thanks in advance for any help p

Negative 57129 pI am using the Javascript Module Pattern to try and implement C enumerationlike functionality. I have two ways that I am currently thinking about implementing this functionality but I do not understand all the benefits or advantages of one way versus the other.p  pHere is implementation 1p  precodevar MyApp  function app        Private Variable     var enums           ActionStatus              New 1,             Open 2,             Closed 3                     Public Method     app.getEnum  function path          var value  enums                     var properties  path.split.         for var i  0, len  properties.length i lt len i              value  value[properties[i]]                  return value           return app  MyApp     Example usage var status  MyApp.getEnumActionStatus.Open codepre  pAnd now implementation 2p  precodevar MyApp  function app        Public Property     app.Enums           ActionStatus              New 1,             Open 2,             Closed 3                    return app  MyApp     Example usage var status  MyApp.Enums.ActionStatus.Open codepre  pThe main difference is in using a private variable vs a public property to store the enums. I would think implementation 1 is a little slower but I was not sure if keeping the enums as private reduced the memory usage. Can anyone explain the difference in memory footprint and performance for the two if any Any other suggestionsadvice are appreciated.p

It is recommended to regenerate this file in the future when you upgrade to a   newer version of cucumberrails. Consider adding your own code to a new file   instead of editing this one.

In  order to ease the transition to Capybara we set the default here. If youd  prefer to use XPath just remove this line and adjust any selectors in your  steps to use the XPath syntax. Capybara.defaultselector  css  Capybara.runserver  true Whether start server when testing Capybara.defaultselector  xpath default selector , you can change to css Capybara.defaultwaittime  2 When we testing AJAX, we can set a default wait time Capybara.ignorehiddenelements  false Ignore hidden elements when testing, make helpful when you hide or show elements using javascript Capybara.javascriptdriver  culerity default driver when you using javascript tag   By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up  to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how   your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will   be rendered instead.   Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue  exceptions and display an error page just like when the app is running in production.  Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.  There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions   1 Tag your scenario or feature with allowrescue   2 Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not  recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you  ActionControllerBase.allowrescue  false   Removecomment out the lines below if your app doesnt have a database.  For some databases like MongoDB and CouchDB you may need to use truncation instead. begin   DatabaseCleaner.strategy  transaction rescue NameError   raise You need to add databasecleaner to your Gemfile in the test group if you wish to use it. end   You may also want to configure DatabaseCleaner to use different strategies for certain features and scenarios.

I stumbled upon this statementp  blockquote   pUnlike codeincludecode, coderequirecode will always read in the target file, even   if the line its on  never executes. If you want to conditionally   include a file, use codeincludecode. The  conditional statement wont affect   the coderequirecode. However, if the line on which the coderequirecode occurs is   not executed, neither will any of the code in the target file be    executed.p blockquote  pThe way I am interpreting it is that includes inside conditionals that do not end up running, will not actually include it in there, which to me seems less costly to the server. I am just curious if this is true. I did not see it in the manual, so I am skeptical.p

Negative 57129 pI have an Order which has a collection of OrderLines. Every OrderLine has a manytoone to a Product. For all Orders I have a searchwindow which  by default  shows all Orders in a grid. Using this same window I can filter all Orders which contain a given Product. Our customer generates about 700 Orders per day and orders have an average of about 35 lines.p  pIn the searchwindow I only show information stored within the Order object itself. But, if I filter for a specific Product, it will initialize my lazy loaded relationship to the collection of OrderLines as well as the manytoone to my Product within my OrderLine. Each orderline is queried line by line, and for each line there is a seperate query to the product table.p  pso on average I get 35 queries per order to initialize all the OrderLines, plus 35 queries to fetch the products associated with that orderline.p  pWhat is the best way to load all orderlines and their associated product at once and if not possible all orderlines per order I know I can map my manytoone to the product in the orderline as a fetchjoin, but that will still leave me with the 35 single queries to get the orderlinesproducts.p  pFYI Currently I load everything lazy.p  pAny suggestions Can I use Future here p  pRegards, Tedp

Negative 57129 pI want to export my big SSMS SQL Server Management Studio query result 2.5m lines, 9 fields as .csv or commadelimited .txt with headings. MS SQL Server 2005 Management Studio.p  pSo that I can then either read it linebyline into VBA program to do certain calculations on the data or do queries on it in Excel e.g. with Microsoft Query. The calculations are complicated and I prefer to do it somewhere else than SSMS. p  pIf I choose query result to text in SSMS and a small answer few lines e.g. up to 200k I could of course simply copy and paste to a text editor. For my large answer here I could of course copy and paste 200k or so lines at a time, 10 times, into a text editor like UltraEdit. When I try all 2.5m at once, I get a memory warning inside SSMS. But for the future Id like a more elegant solution.p  pFor query result to file, SSMS writes to an .rpt file always.  When you rightclick in the results window and choose save as, it gives a memory error just like above. p  p So it looks like my only option is to have SSMS output its result to a file i.e. .rpt and then afterwards, convert the .rpt to .txt.p  pI assume this .rpt is a Crystal Reports file Or isnt it. I dont have Crystal Reports on my PC, so I cannot use that to convert the file.p  pWhen opening the .rpt in UltraEdit it looks fine. However in Microsoft Query in Excel, the headings doesnt want to show.p  pWhen I simply read amp write the .rpt using VBA, the file halves in size. 330meg to 180meg. In Microsoft Query the headings do show now though the first field name has a funny leading character, which has happened to me before in other totally different situations. I do seem to be able to do meaningful pivot tables on it in Excel.p  pHowever when I open this new file in UltraEdit, it shows Chinese characters Could there still be some funny characters in it somewherep  p Is there perhaps a free and simple safe converter app available somewhere. Or should I just trust that this .txt is fine for reading into my VBA program.p  pThanksp

Negative 57129 pIm working with EF4.3.1 and have implemented the DBContext.br I have several entities with parentchild relationships.  When I update an existing parent, I retreive the existing parent entity, make my changes, attach it to the context, mark it as modified and call SaveChanges.br If there are children entities on the parent, I follow a similiar process find existing, make changes and mark them as modified.  I have a Generic method to loop through all of the children collections on my entity and add or attach them to the context, but I also need to remove any that are no longer in the parent collection.  p  pFor example, lets say my Parent Entity is a Program and each Program has a child collection of Locations.  When I first insert a Program it has 3 Locations.  When I later go to update the parent, the number of Locations has been reduced to 2.

Negative 57129 pSo I have a problem with the Dojo switch which is really annoying I hope someone can help me out from wracking my brains over and over with this and its probably something simple that Im not seeing.p  pBasically, I want to run an if statement to determine whether the switch should be on or off when the user loads the page in question. That sounds easy enough, so heres what I tried to dop  precodedocument.getElementByIdreqPasswordSettingToggle.value  on codepre  pSo that doesnt work because at run time, the id gets disattached from the switch and so it doesnt know what value its setting to on. So, I thought the next bit of code would workp  precodedocument.getElementsByNamepasswordSwitch.value  off codepre  pAt run time, the switch does have the name available, and this legal manner of accessing the name should work. It doesnt. I printed some debug from my if statement and it tells me its successfully changed the value, but that is not reflected on the screen. Why I hope someone will know the answer to thatp  pIf you need any more information let me know, but this is simply an attempt to set this mobile switch to on or off based on a simple if statement in JS.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 57129 pIve recently watched some Lynda tutorials on how to program in Objective C and Cocoa. Coming from a PHP and C background, one thing caught my attention  event handling. As I was watching the tutorials, the mentor was going through subclassing in order to attach to events.p  pHe eventually discussed creating delegates and attaching to the events that way  better, but still not near as easy as C. However, I later found out that not everything has a delegate, which makes things even emmoreem difficult.p  pIve been searching the Internet for a way to handle events without making a subclass so that I dont end up with this application that has an enormous amount of files, but to no avail.p  pIm specifically trying to attach to a mouseLeave or mouseOut event for a NSSlider object so that I can hide a label once its finished sliding.p  pIs there some way I can attach to the event without doing any subclassing, or is creating subclass after subclass something that I should just get used top

Negative 57129 pEDIT As result of the answers so far I like to add more focus in what I like to zero in on A database that allows writing inmemory could be simple C code with persistence to storage options in order to access the data from within R. Redis so far looks the most promising. I also consider to actually use something similar to Lockfree or ZeroMQ, in order to avoid writing data concurrently to the database, but rather sending all to be persisted data over a message busother implementation and to have one actor handle all write operations to an inmemory db or other solution. Any more ideas aside Redis some mentioned SQLite and I will need to still test its performance. Any other suggestions p  pI am searching for the ideal database structuresolution that meets most of my below requirements but so far I utterly failed. Can you please helpp  pMy tasks I run a process in .Net 4.5 C and generate generally value types that I want to use for further analysis in other applications and therefore like to either preserve inmemory or persist on disk. More below. The data is generated within different tasksthreads and thus a row based data format does not lend itself well to match this situation because the data generated in different threads is generated at different times and is thus not aligned. Thus I thought a columnar data structure may be suitable but please correct me if I am wrong.p  pExamplep  pTasksThread 1 generates the following data at given time stampsp  pdatetime.ticks  value of output datap  p1000000001 233.23p  p1000000002 233.34p  p1000000006 234.23 ...p  pTaksThread 2 generates the following data at given time stampsp  pdatetime.ticks  value of output datap  p1000000002 33.32p  p1000000005 34.34p  p1000000015 54.32 ...p  pI do not need to align the time stamps at the .Net runtime, I am first and foremost after preserving the data and to process the data within R or Python at a later point.p  pMy requirementsp  ul lipFast writes, fast writes, fast writes It can happen that I generate 100,000 1,000,000 data points per second and need to persist worst case or retain in memory the data. Its ok to run the writes on its own thread so this process can lag the data generation process but limitation is 16gb RAM 64bit code, more below.pli lipPreference is for columnar db format as it lends itself well to how I want to query the data later but I am open to any other structure if it makes sense in regards to the examples above documentkeyvalue also ok if all other requirements are met, especially in terms of write speed. pli lipAPI that can be referenced from within .Net. Example HDF5 may be considered capable by some but I find their .Net port horrible.Something that supports .Net a little better would be a plus but if all other requirements are met then I can deal with something similar to the HDF5 .Net port.  pli lipConcurrent writes if possible As described earlier I like to write data concurrently from different tasksthreads.pli lipI am constrained by 16gb memory run .Net process in 64bit and thus I probably look for something that is not purely inmemory as I may sometimes generate more data than that. Something inmemory which persists at times or a pure persistence model is probably preferable. pli lipPreference for embedded but if a server in a clientserver solution can run as a windows service then no issue. pli lipIn terms of data access I have strong preference for a db solution for which interfaces from R and Python already exist because I like to use the Panda library within Python for time series alignments and other analysis and run analyses within R.pli lipIf the APIlibrary supports in addition SQLSQLlikeLinq like queries that would be terrific but generally I just need the absolute bare bones such as load columnar data in between start and end date given the keyindex is in such format because I analyze and run queries within RPython.pli lipIf it comes with a management console or data visualizer that would be a plus but not a must. pli lipShould be open source or priced within reach no, KDB does not qualify in that regards pli ul  pOK, here is what I have so far, and again its all I got because most db solution simply fail already on the write performance requirementp  ul liInfobright and Db4o. I like what I read so far but I admit I have not checked into any performance statsli liSomething done myself. I can easily store value types in binary format and index the data by datetime.ticks , I just would need to somehow write scripts to loaddeserialize the data in PythonR. But it would be a massive tasks if I wanted to add concurrency, a query engine, and other goodies. Thus I look for something already out there. li ul

Each codeMultiSelectcode is composed of 2 codeStorescode left side, and right side with arrows to move items between the 2.p  pWhen I load the panel, I feed a reference, in order to highlight the items moved from one side to the other e.g. set style as red for moved items because today there is no way to differentiate them.p  pI managed to catch event codeafterAddcode on  the codeStorescode and apply my style through DOM access. That works during trace, but later on remaining ExtJS standard calls are performed, overriding the style I just applied...p  pI feel what Im doing is not the good way, but Im new to ExtJS so Im a bit lost here...

Negative 57129 pIm an embedded engineer not a network guru building a piece of Linuxbased equipment a portable measurement instrument that is normally not connected to the Internet, but we need to make it possible for the equipment to call home for support, including updates and troubleshooting, in a manner that compromises neither the products security, nor the customers network security nor our own company network.p  pThe call home capability will be completely controlled by the user, perhaps by pressing a physical button to activate it, after the equipment has been connected to whatever network the customer chooses to use.  For prototype and demonstrations systems, this network could be at someones home or office or even via a phone connection the equipment will contain only a wired Ethernet port, and the customer would need to provide a wired AP if WiFi access is desired.p  pMaking the connection should require no percall configuration at the users end, nor within our box, so Im thinking we can require the customer to provide DHCP, and not much else.  We can also require the customer to first contact us before pressing the call home button, so we can have our support interface up only when needed.p  pWhen a unit does call home, it merely makes a connection to a company system, doing nothing else until an engineer well, me directly connects to it.  Other than the existence of the connection, we should get no or minimal information about the network the customer is using.  So Im thinking some kind of SSH connection, but thats as far as I have gotten.p  pIf possible, it should feel as if Im connecting locally, as if the unit were on my desk perhaps with much more latency, loss, and minimal bandwidth.p  pBut I have no idea whatsoever how to make an SSH connection if thats the right tool to use for this as two separate halves The remote unit calls somewhere, presumably on one of our company systems, then that system notifies an engineer me that a call home has been initiated, then waits for the engineer to connect, forming the other half of the connection.p  pThe connection need not identify the remote system make, model, serial number, version, etc. Id do that manually after logging in securely.p  pIf needed, I can create a new system on our end Linux, BSD, Windows, whatever, physical or VM that can be dedicated to just this function.  I can get at least one static port mapped out to our corporate WAN, if needed but something Id prefer to avoid, if possible.p  pIdeally, Id also like for there to be minimal information in the equipment itself, so that possession of the equipment by an adversary or competitor could not compromise customer or company networks, other units, nor the callhome technique itself.  From what little I know, Id guess a hostname or IP address, a port number, and a key would be needed, but less would be betterp  pId also like the system to require manual intervention at both ends, with minimal automation that can be buggy or be compromised.  Once we implement and test the initial system, automation could be added as our experience with it, and confidence in it, grows.p  pThats about as far as my thinking has taken me.  Beyond this, Im pretty much clueless.  Am I on the right track  What pieces am I missing  Is this already a popular thing to do, and I simply dont know what it is called  How simple and stupid can this capability be made for a couple of prototype systemsp  pEDIT If it wasnt obvious already, please assume Im a networking idiot who can be trusted only to follow an explicit recipe, and not much more.  KISS appliesp

Negative 57129 pI have a model Laps, which belongs to Carp  pSo each car has many laps, but I need to do a query where i pull in the top 10 fastest Laps, but only pull in the fastest lap per each car. In other words, I do not want one car to be allowed to have 5 of the top 10 fastest laps in the list.p  pEach lap has a carid field. I want to group on this column, and then pull out the lap with the minLap.time row from the grouping. AKA fastest lap time from that unique carid.p  pSo with Postgres, what is my best approach to this Can I order all laps first, then group, and then pull the first from the group.

Negative 57129 pMy application is built using the codeAny CPUcode configuration. The WIX installer for the application is built with codeplatformx86code so the resultant MSI is 32bit. p  pWhen I run the 32bit MSI on a 64bit Windows. The code[ProgramFilesFolder]code property is resolved to CProgram Files x86 and the registry paths are resolved to the codeWow6432Nodecode. When I run the application, the process is 64bit  as expected.p  pAs far as I understand after reading lots of related posts on SO. On a 64bit Windows, to make the code[ProgramFilesFolder]code resolved to CProgram Files and registry path to normal path not under codeWow6432Nodecode. I need a separate 64bit MSI. Which I am trying to avoid  For me, to have a separate 64bit MSI merely for code[ProgramFilesFolder]code and regsitry path to resolve to correct location is not worthwhile. As long as my program still runs 64bit on a 64bit Windows, I dont really care about it is installed at CProgram Files x86 by default and some registry values exist at codeWow6432Nodecode.    p  pSo, my question is, is there the other consequences when I install a AnyCPU program on a 64bit Windows using a 32bit MSI other than by default the installDir is CProgram Files x86 and some registry values are stored under the codeWow6432Nodecode  p

Negative 57129 pI have a bit of a problem and Im hoping you can help.  I have a site where I have to add students to a database and link them to families assigned to them. Linking the families is okay, I have this done using id numbers which auto increment when you add the family and student. These are on two separate tables within the database. The problem Im having is that multiple students can be added to a family but with only one student to be added at any one time.p  pAt the moment Im adding simply with id numbers but I have to take into account two things. In the student table there is an arrival and departure date which corresponds with airport arrival date and in the family table there are six fields, 3 with arrival dates and 3 with departure dates of students already assigned to them. p  pI need it that the new student added will not add if the arrival dates and departure dates cross over although an error can come up and it can be overwritten if needs be. If the dates dont overlap and the departure date of one of the students is already gone before Now date then it will overwrite that. Any help would be appreciated.

Negative 57129 pmy first time asking a question here, this site is very helpful, I just couldnt find the answer to my problem.p  pPlease bear with me, I will explain myself fully before presenting my question p  pI am working on a html5 game that runs on desktop, and on mobile devices as an app.p  pIn a part of the game, I have a 1500 x 1200 canvas that is rendered to once, and it is placed somewhere in the DOM, within a div that is smaller, which allows scrolling the canvas within that div.p  pThis works exceptionally well on Desktop and iOS mobile. But it doesnt run very well on Android. By poor performance I mean it takes a second or two for the touch to get registered, and then the canvas lags behind as the finger moves to scroll it.p  pI have done much research and a lot of testingp  pI was able to improve performance a bit by turning off easeljs and related scripts temporary, but the rest of the app needs this. Further performance was gained by removing bindings off of document and other elements. But still, Android performance didnt match that of iOS and Desktop.p  pEventually, I gained near Desktop performance when the canvas element was .removed and appended to html body instead. Why is this I obviously cant have it this way in the game, but I need to re create this performance increase somehow.p  pstrongHere is what is even more perplexing.strong Again removing and appending that same Canvas element BACK to where it was in the DOM, is now still far better in terms of performance. It now scrolls much smoother with less touch input lag. Can someone give hints or explain why this is sop  pWhat are the possible causes of this sort of behaviorp  pstrongeditstrong More explanation about my question. What are some major performance hits on Android when scrolling an element Too many events firing on touch Element too deep in DOM Too much CSS in DOM EaselJS not playing nicep  pThank youp

Negative 57129 pI have two spring projects both using maven. The first is a client for some api and the second is a console program that, in part, utilises that client.p  pI have packaged up the client into a jar and referenced it in the pom for the console program.p  pI have managed to get this working, just about, but I am not very happy with the solutionp  pstrong1strong The first problem I ran into was that each of the context xml files were named applicationContext.xml. Therefore, I couldnt work out any way to reference the context file in the client, without renaming it to something else e.g. clientContext.xml. This works but is there any other way to reference it explicitlyp  pstrong2strong The next issue was how to invoke the clientContext.xml from within the console program. To do this, I have added codeltimport resourceosrdClientContext.xmlgtcode to the applicationContext.xml of the console program and this seems to allow it to correctly find all of the defined beans. Im not sure if this is best practice thoughp  pstrong3strong Within clientContext.xml, I need to reference a properties file and so have the line codeltcontextpropertyplaceholder locationclasspathapi.properties gtcode. This works when running the client on its own but appears to get ignored or fails to find the file when running the console program. The api.properties file is in the root of the packaged jar for the client and the jar is in the classpath of the console program. The only workaround I have found is to manually copy the properties file into the console program, at which point it is found without any problem.p  pstrong4strong Both projects have a resources directory with subdirectories dev, beta and prod. This allows me to define different properties depending on the maven profile I want to run against. This works fine for the individual projects but when I package the client, it only includes the properties files for the profile I am running against which makes sense. However, that then means if I run the console project against profile beta, it will still run the client against whatever profile it was packaged against. It would be handy to be able to package all of the properties files and get the client to run in the same profile as whatever is depending on it. Is that possiblea good ideap

Negative 57129 pI have an encoderdecoder code, it takes word dumps with whitespaces with a n in the end as input, and encodes the top 5 word occurrences in the text, and vice versa. It seems to be working as charm, but my supervisor program still gives 6 fails from 10 times. I encode the input file, then decode the encoded input file, and it works perfectly. Still dont understand whats wrong with it. Please guys I need your eyes p  pSimple encoder Find the 5 most common  at least 3 char long  words in a file, and replace them with a short code. The codes are 2 char long, and look like this 1 2...5. 1 replaces the word with the most occurrences in the text, and 5 replaces the word with the least occurrences. If two words have the same occurrence, the first in line goes first in the codelist sooner better. The rest of the words have to be untouched. In the beginning of the encoded file, the codelist have to be presented. The program has to have decoding function as well. If the input starts with a , then it have to adapt the codelist, and decode the whole file, recovering the original state. Input Two kind of input files can exist. The original input contains a maximum of 2000 words with whitespaces between, a maximum of 22 characters each word. After the last word, there is no whitespace, but a newline n. Words are made from the letters of the english alphabet, all lowercase. Non of the words contains any  sign. There are always a minimum of 5 different kind of words with at least of 3 chars. Warning If the input format equals the output format, decoding is needed of course In case of decoding, the limit of 2000 words and 22 chars max are valid morover the codelist in the beginning of the file of course. Output Fist 5 lines contain the codelist. First word is the code, next to it the word, which it is replacing. Whitespace between, newline after the replacebale word. From the 6th line, there comes the encoded text which needs decoding. Whitespaces between the words, only one newline at the end. Warning Output file format can equal input file format In that case encoding is needed of course.p  pRequirements input.txt for reading readonly and output.txt writeonly for writing.

Negative 57129 pI have been developing a client game. I have enabled game center from iTunesConnect, created leaderboards and also created InApps. But when I try to call them in the code, there is no response. Game Center is showing no items and in apps are giving any response i.e products are not loaded. Everything is correct, provisioning is correct, bundle id is setup correctly, game center and in apps are enabled. I tried the same code with my own game center and in apps and they worked fine. One thing missing in clients itunes connect is Contact and Tax Information. Is that the problem Thats why apple isnt allowing me to add game center and in apps Thanksp

I want the section for internal tracking, and Im all for transparency.p  pIf I simply comment the section, it does not show up under the editors. So the revision history might not be updated because its not present.p  pGoggling is producing pages on removing the Chapter and Section prefix from the headers title, and not the result I seek.p  pHow do I suppress the output of a chapter or section in the final PDF document, while leaving it in the sourcesp

Negative 57129 pI was playing the other day, trying to see how far could I optimize something. I decided to start from a simple map that just does a linear search to find if an element is there, and then try to optimize the most of it. Also, to compare, I do the same with a stdmap and a stdvector using stdfind. p  pThe results with the map are the expected ones, slower creation and destruction than my map, but much more speed actually, I have been unable to mesure it, it returns 0 allways.  The problem is with stdvector. I expected it to be slower than my implementation, but is not, and I really dont understand how can it be the same or faster, as my implementation is skipping a worst case the value isnt in the vector and is using a cache of results.p  pCan anyone shed some light here I know that the guys behind stl are semigods, but still, this doesnt make sense.p  pBenchmark results  i3, Windows 8.1 Pro 64, Visual Studio 2013 p  precodestdvector      Build  85.0042 ms     Loop  37.0011 ms     Find  1.82259 ms  gt First  Found, Second  Found, Third  Not Found     Release  0 ms  stdmap      Build  6929.41 ms     Loop  570.032 ms     Find  0 ms  gt First  Found, Second  Found, Third  Not Found     Release  1425.08  Linear Map V0     Build  194.012 ms     Loop  49.0052 ms     Find  1.88915 ms gt First  Found, Second  Found, Third  Not Found     Release  109.004 codepre  pHeres the code for the mapp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class LinearMap0  public LinearMap0      end  root  new Node     prebuffer  nullptr     prebufferCapacity  0     alive  true     prebufferMarker  0     cache  mmset1epi321     for autoamp ptr  cacheBuffer ptr  nullptr     MinID  INT32MAX  1     MaxID  1  void PreAllocateint Count      prebufferCapacity  Count     prebuffer  new Node[Count]  LinearMap0      if alive              Release       void Release      Node marker  end     while markergtPrev              marker  markergtPrev         if markergtNextgtIsPreAllocated delete markergtNext           if rootgtIsPreAllocated delete root     delete[] prebuffer      alive  false   void AddElementint ID,T element      Node tmp  nullptr     if prebufferMarker lt prebufferCapacity               Use a preallocated object         tmp  ampprebuffer[prebufferMarker]         prebufferMarker         tmpgtIsPreAllocated  true          else              tmp  new Node           tmpgtID  ID     tmpgtData  element       Update list     endgtNext  tmp     Node prevEnd  end     end  tmp     endgtPrev  prevEnd     bool isMin  ID lt MinID MinID  ID  isMin  1  isMin  MinID     bool isMax  ID gt MaxID MaxID  ID  isMax  1  isMax  MaxID  void DeleteLast      Node tmp  end      end  endgtPrev     endgtNext  nullptr      delete tmp   templateltclass Functiongt void LoopFunctionampamp f, bool Forward  true      if Forward              Node marker  root         while markergtNext                      marker  markergtNext             fmarkergtData                   else              Node marker  end         while markergtPrev                      marker  markergtPrev             fmarkergtData                 T Findint ID       Bounds check     if ID lt MinID  ID gt MaxID return nullptr       Check it its in the cache       Compare the value to every value in the cache     m128i idxSSE  mmset1epi32ID     m128i C  mmcmpeqepi32cache, idxSSE       To change form 1 to 1     C  mmmulepi32C, mmset1epi321       Now C holds 1 if true, or 0 if false in each of its 4 members.

Negative 57129 pI have a model called UserProfile which stores additional data about a django user.p  pThis model has a OneToOneField to django.contrib.auth.models.Userp  pI also have a post save signal on a User object that is fired on initial insert of a User which creates a UserProfile object linked to that Userp  precodedef createuserprofilesender, instance, created, kwargs     if created         UserProfile.objects.createuserinstance  postsave.connectcreateuserprofile, senderUser codepre  pUser objects can be created via the website front end which when saved creates the UserProfile. This all works fine.p  pI also have an admin.py file that allows a User and UserProfile object to be created via the admin consolep  precodefrom django.contrib import admin from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin from myproject.apps.users.models import UserProfile  admin.site.unregisterUser   class UserProfileInlineadmin.StackedInline     model  UserProfile     filterhorizontal  [companies]     exclude  [         field1, fieldn     ]   class UserProfileAdminUserAdmin     inlines  [UserProfileInline]  admin.site.registerUser, UserProfileAdmin codepre  pWhen creating a new User via the admin console, the UserProfile form is displayed below the User form. If I leave all UserProfile fields as default i.e. do not enter any data into the form fields or change any default values the User is created successfully with the UserProfile. If however I attempt to add any values or update any defaults in the UserProfile form it falls over with the errorp  precodeIntegrityError at adminauthuseradd  duplicate key value violates unique constraint usersuserprofileuseridkey DETAIL  Key userid6323 already exists. codepre  pThis indicates the postsave signal on the User object has been called twice, both times the created flag that has been passed into the signal has been set to True resulting in an attempt in inserting a UserProfile object twice with the same User id. Django ends up rolling back the transaction and neither the User or UserProfile objects are inserted.p  pTo add a bizarre twist if I completely remove the postsave signal everything works fine in the admin console and django appears to magically create the UserProfile object for me without even apparently knowing about it. Obviously this then breaks the front end as it relies on this postsave signal to create the UserProfile object.p  pIm running Django 1.6 using PostgreSQL.p  pAny shedding of light on this situation would be hugely appreciated. Otherwise I think another approach to how the UserProfile is managed in the admin console will have to be considered.p

Negative 57129 pI am developing an android application in which users can see the list of the videos in our database. All the videos are saved in Ooyala video platform.p  pNow when the user clicks on download video button, that video needs to be saved in the application cache. The user can view the video later at anytime. But I need it to be downloaded in the application cache itself, not in the library, so that the user can share that video easily.p  pSo I created a local dababase in the application and saved the video lists. p  pBut I am stuck here, in saving the cache area.p

Negative 57129 pIm continuously sending arrays of pixel values 160x120 as a bytestream from LabVIEW to a Cprogram through TCPIP. Then Im converting the bytes to uint32 values and printing the received data in the console application. The goal here, is that I want to divide the received data in 1D arrays, so every 1D array will consists of 160x12019200 integer values, so it represents a frame. In better words, the array has to collect every 19200 integers of the received data and display them in the console application. Then the same array has to collect the next 19200 integers and display them in the console application and so on.

Negative 57129 pI am using SQL Test to create some unit tests in SQL Server. And I integrated with Teamcity so that on a build, it auto runs the tSQLt tests. p  pThe issue is that we plan to create hundreds of unit tests for all our store procs. And we dont want to run all of the unit tests each time we check in code and whereby Teamcity runs a build  runs all the unit tests. p  pIs there a way to configure the integration build to only run the new unit tests that are checked in. Would I need to create a custom script for this I cant seem to find a way out of the box.p  pOr is the practical solution to check in without Teamcity auto running the tSQLt unit tests Thereby, just manually run the new test cases on the DEV server after check in An extension of this is to run a batch nightly to run ALL the unit tests.p

Negative 57129 pBeen through a few threads and wasnt able to find this situation exactly. My page is ASP.NET 4.5, C. I use Server Side validation for IMHO security reasons and have several validation groups on a dynamic form. p  pI think we are all familiar with the advantages of disabling a button during Postback to prevent double clicking. Ive read through quite a few threads with examples using OnClientClick in various ways. p  pWhat Id like my page to do is something like thisp  p1   User clicks Submit or whatever button 2  Serverside custom validation fires on appropriate validation group 3  if the validation passes, disable the client buttons and proceed with Postback 4  if the validation doesnt pass, show the error as usual. Client buttons should still be enabled.p  pNumber 3 seems to be the kicker. Is this even possible with serverside validation It seems out of order to validate serverside, come back to execute javascript, then back to postback. If it is possible, then Im muddy on some of the mechanics. Specifically, how to tell the client that the specific validation group passed okay on the server side. Less specifically, the entire thing, lol. p  pThanksp

Negative 57129 pI am getting a list of objects separately and not from NHibernate and setting the parent objects IEnumerable equal to this returned object. Originally, we only needed to read the objects.  Then we had the need to update only specific fields on the parent.  Recently, we needed to update fields on the child.  So far, all was well with SaveOrUpdate.  Now, I need to update the children even if the collection of children was attached to a detached parent object not using NHibernate.  The following code results in the parent being updated, but not the children.  If I do all, then the children would be deleted if the parent does not have a collection.  I do not want to do this because I am worried about legacy uses of this that does not account for this behavior.  p  pDESIRED BEHAVIORbr  1. Cascade any changes to the collection whether in the parent was retrieved by NHibernate or not.  2. Do not delete objects even if the parent does not have a collection of children.p  pIs this possiblep  pThis is our NHibernate save methodp  precode[Transaction] public int SaveDocumentFieldDTO entity, bool autoFlush      var persisted  CurrentSession.Mergeentity      entity.DocumentFieldID  persisted.DocumentFieldID     if autoFlush  CurrentSession.Flush      return entity.DocumentFieldID  codepre  pThe DocumentFieldDTOMap looked like thisp  precodepublic class DocumentFieldDTOMap  EntityMapBase       public DocumentFieldDTOMap                  TableDocumentField          Idm ampgt m.DocumentFieldID.GeneratedBy.Increment.UnsavedValuenull          Mapx ampgt x.Name          Mapx ampgt x.DocumentSectionID.Not.Update          ....

I want to eliminate the delete capability.p  pUPDATE 1272014p  pI just verified that the deletes were cascading when the mapping was codeSaveUpdatecode, so this isnt as big an issue since I am not changing the existing functionality.  I would still like to be able to update all cascading EXCEPT delete.  An solution, if possible, would be great for future reference.p  pUPDATE 2102014p  pThe following is the tests that verify that the children are deleted when cascade is SaveUpdate.  The codeGetDocumentFieldDTOWithADODocumentFieldIDcode uses the same transaction as NHibernate and has 318 DocumentFieldOrgs on the first call before the save and 0 when called after the save.  Maybe there is an issue with the test  Does it delete the children because I call Mergep  precode    [Test]     public void SaveShouldDeleteDocumentFieldOrgsWhenSavingDocumentFieldWithoutDocFieldOrgsList              arrange         var expectedDocField  GetDocumentFieldDTOWithADODocumentFieldID         expectedDocField.DocumentFieldOrgs  null          act         Repository.SaveexpectedDocField, false         SessionFactory.GetCurrentSession.FlushAndEvictexpectedDocField          assert         var actualDocField  GetDocumentFieldDTOWithADODocumentFieldID          actualDocField.DocumentFieldOrgs.Should             .BeEmptyDocumentFieldOrgs should be deleted if the parent does not have a child collection              codepre  pUPDATED 2112014  Radim was correct in his answer below.  NHibernate did not delete the children.  It disassociated them from the parent.p

Negative 57129 pstrongYou are given an unsorted array of n integers, and you would like to find if there are any duplicates in the array i.e. any integer appearing more than once. Describe an algorithm implemented with two nested loops to do this.strong   p  pMy description of the algorithm  p  pIn step 1, we write a while loop to check to see if the array is emptynull, if the array is not null then we proceed with an inner loop.br Step 2, we now write a for loop to run an iteration of n1 and in that loop we will assign to current variable the first index in the array in the first iteration and we will update the current variable by index  1 each time through the iteration which means that the first time, current will hold the first index in the array and the second time, it will hold the second index in the array and so on until the loop ends.br Step 3, we will write a loop within the for loop used in step 2 to compare the current number to all the integers in the array, if the integer equals to the next number then we will print the number using a printf statement else update next to hold the next index in the array  and use that to compare to the current variable and do so until it has been compared to all the integers in the array and once this has been done, the current variable will be updated to store the next index of the array and will compare that particular number to all the integers in the array.  p  pWill the algorithm be correct according to the question... youre suggestions would be grateful. And no its not a homework question or such. Thank you for your time.   p  pThe complexity is definitely strongO N2  N  N  12strong Or strongemON2emstrong in its simplified manner.   p  pEditbr I have added a description of an algorithm that is more efficient in the question below. But going back to the question above, would it be suitable as an answer for an exam question it has shown up in previous papers so i would really appreciate your help. p  pstrongIf we limit the input data in order to achieve some best case scenario, how can you limit the input data to achieve a better Big O complexity Describe an algorithm for handling this limited data to find if there are any duplicates. What is the Big O complexitystrong   p  pIf we limit the data to, lets say, array size of 5 n  5, we could reduce the complexity to ON.   If the array is sorted, than all we need is a single loop to compare each element to the next element in the array and this will find if duplicates exist.   Which simply means that if an array given to us is by default or luckily already sorted from lowest to highest value in this case the reduction will be from ON2 to ON as we wouldnt need the inner loop for comparing the integers for sorting since it is already sorted therefore we could implement a single loop to compare the integers to its successor and if a duplicate is encountered, then we could, for instance, use a printf statement to print the duplicates and proceed to iterate the loop n1 times which would be 4 ending the program once that has been done.   The best case in this algorithm would be ON simply because the performance grows linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data so if we have a sorted array of size 50 50 integers in the array then the iteration would be n1 the loop will iterate 50  1 times where n is the length of the array which is 50.   The running time in this algorithm increases in direct proportion to the input size. This simply means that in a sorted array, the amount of time the operations take to perform is completely dependent on the input size of the array.  p  pp.s. Sure there are other algorithms efficient and faster but from my knowledge and from what the question asks is for a better big o complexity in the first question and i believe this algorithm achieves that. correct me if im wrong thanks p

The component array can hold an arbitrary amount of components with unique uids which can be different for every execution. Therefore I guess I definitely have to use an array for components.p  blockquote   pThe problem with slice in this context is that you actually dont know which array element out of the nesting to operate on. So the style you have presented will not work because the elements could be and any possible index. The correct form, if it were supported, and which it is not would be something likep blockquote  pThe position of a specific component inside of an array is the only index I do not know, since the data creating application initializes an execution before the values are updated. Thus I only need one single positional  operator. It should look something like code components..outputsamples.0.values  slice 5  code.p  blockquote   pNested lists are going to be a problem for various things and are notoriously bad for updating. Where possible you should consider alternatives. In this case if you want to limit your output, then the only practical way is to retrieve the whole document, then process the arrays in code to limit the returned results.p blockquote  pI guess it was a small mistake to simplify my real intention. I would like to use the slice operator to skip the first n elements and retrieve the following m elements. These two variables should be specified by the user. However, the codeoutputsamples.0.valuescode field could contain multiple million values. Or even more. This is why I would like to gather just as many values as the user needs..p  pI really appreciate your detailed answer.p

Negative 57129 pIm a python programmer writing some c wrapped in ctypes to speed up some tight loops.  Im having trouble with a function that takes a two dimensional array codedouble[2]code, does some things to it and returns it.  Function looks something like the followingp  precodedouble processint n, double results[2], ...       Do some things to results     return results  codepre  pHere, n is the number of elements in the first level of results.  This doesnt compile, apparently Im returning from an incompatible pointer type.  Making it codereturn resultscode allows it to compile and run all the contained logic is fine, but segfaults at the return.  Making the function a codedouble code and returning with any number of codecodes doesnt let me compile.p  pClearly Im being an idiot here, which isnt surprising at all as I dont really understand c pointers.  What do I need to do to make this work  Ive got another function that returns a codedouble code working fine, so its clearly something to do with the 2D array.p

Negative 57129 pThe Setup  I have a code base that includes a few PCLs one of those PCL is a group of data access classes that call out to my WCF Data service.  Ive leveraged the Task.Factory.FromAsync to manage the beginExecuteendExecute of calling out to the WCF Data service.  I then await for the results and send the data to the application.  I started out by first creating a Win Store app and everything worked great.  Now Im in the process of creating a win phone 8 UI.  Now Im running into a snag.  The snag seems to be an exception on the line that awaits the task created by the Task.Factory.FromAsync method.  To further complicate matters the exception does not happen if I install and run the application for the first time.  The second time I open the application the error is thrown.  So Im really confused as to why the second run causes the error since all of the same logic is being followed.  The exception I get isnt from anything in my code but seems to be from the .NET library itself.  Ive tried a few other things to try to solve this mysterious issue.  I created a Task.Delay task and that line has no problem, but when I call await on its task I get the exact same error.  I tried to just get the Task.Result instead of awaiting it and the result is never returned so the application just hangs and an exception was never thrown either.p  pI didnt run into any issues in my WinRT application so Im guessing all of my logic is sound and there shouldnt be any odd threading issues, etc.p  pThe Exceptionp  pA first chance exception of type System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException occurred in mscorlib.ni.dll When I get this exception I also get a tab in visual studio that says Source Code Not Available.

Ive just pounded my brain to figure this out and am coming short.  Its really frustrating as I was hoping all the hard work was done with the WinRT app and now all I need to do was create a quick simple UI on the windows phone 8.

Negative 57129 pLets say I have two collections, A and B, and a single document in A is related to N documents in B. For example, the schemas could look like thisp  precodeCollection A id int,  propA1 int,  propA2 boolean  Collection B idA int,  id for document in Collection A  propB1 int,  propB2 ...,  ...  propBN ...  codepre  pI want to return properties codepropB2BNcode and codepropA2code from my API, and only return information where for example codepropA2  truecode, codepropB6  42code, and codepropB1  propA1code.p  pThis is normally fairly simple  I query Collection B to find documents where codepropB6  42code, collect the codeidAcode values from the result, query Collection A with those values, and filter the results with the Collection A documents from the query.p  pHowever, adding skip and limit parameters to this seems impossible to do while keeping the behavior users would expect. Naively applying skip and limit to the first query means that, since filtering occurs after the query, less than limit documents could be returned. Worse, in some cases no documents could be returned when there are actually still documents in the collection to be read. For example, if the limit was 10 and the first 10 Collection B documents returned pointed to a document in Collection A where codepropA2  falsecode, the function would return nothing. Then the user would assume theres nothing left to read, which may not be the case.p  pA slightly less naive solution is to simply check if the return count is lt limit, and if so, repeat the queries until the return count  limit. The problem here is that skiplimit queries where the user would expect exclusive sets of documents returned could actually return the same documents.p  pI want to apply skip and limit at the mongo query level, not at the API level, because the results of querying collection B could be very large.p  pa hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencecommandmapReducedbcmd.mapReduce relnofollowMapReducea and the a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualcoreaggregationpipeline relnofollowaggregation frameworka appear to only work on a single collection, so they dont appear to be alternatives.p  pThis seems like something thatd come up a lot in Mongo use  any ideashints would be appreciated.p  pNote that a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions21040592howtouselimitoperatorontwocollectionsinmongodbthesea a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions21067464mongodbjoinlikequerywithtwocollectionsandawhereclausepostsa ask similar sounding questions but dont actually address the issues raised here.p

Negative 57129 pPreviously before XCode 5.1.1, disconnecting the Mac running the simulator from the network OR using the Network Link Conditioner was enough to replicate poor or disconnected network connections on the iOS simulator.p  pAfter the XCode 5.1.1 update, the simulator does not appear to respond to network changes and there does not seem to be anyway to make it change its default network status.

Negative 57129 pAs per the Android 4.4 developer guideline we have to use Fragment in each activity. If we make inner fragment class nonstatic then Android will crash our app when it comes from background to foreground so we need to make the fragment class static. In that case all the variables and classes which have been used in the fragment class other than fragment class variable should be static.p  pI think that will consume more VM memory and the app will be unstable.

In searching the internet, the most common solution to send multiple files to a browser is to zip them up, and send a single zip file.p  pTowards that end, I need to learn a few things I do not knowp  p1 What toolmethods preferably built in to ASP.NET running on IIS7 can I use to create a zip filestream to send to a browserp  p2 How do I fool the zip tool into thinking it is getting multiple files from strings in memory I assume I need to create filestreams, but how do I tell the methods what the file name is, etc.p  pIf there is an example of doing something substantially similar to what I need available, that would be great. Just point me at it.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 57129 pI have a typical web application forms authentication process with two stepsp  ul liStep 1 Request username and passwordli liStep 2 Request some characters from a secret phraseli ul  pShould I authenticate the username and password before going to Step 2 Or should I collect all three bits of information username, password and characters and check them at the endp  pMost websites Ive seen check the username and password and if they dont authenticate, never ask for the characters. On the other hand, it could be argued that checking everything at the end and if they dont match, displaying an error message that doesnt explain which bit failed would be more secure. That gives away less information like displaying Username or password is incorrect without specifying which in a simple 1 step authentication.p  pThe problem with the second approach aside from being less userfriendly is that Step 2 requires obtaining a valid user in Step 1, otherwise its hard to know the length of the secret phrase to ask for valid characters theres no point asking for the 10th character if the phrase is only 9 characters long. The application would also have to hold on to the password in a secure manner between the two steps.p  pSo which one is better Is there a third approach I should considerp

Negative 57129 pI have a model that has a list of objects as one of its properties, and Im trying to figure out how to get them to post correctly. Its a jQuery Mobile project with MVC 4, but Im trying to figure out if Handlebars is the way to go for displaying the list, or if theres a way to use html helpers.p  pWhats happening is the user will select how many children they have, and for each child there needs to be a dropdown for the age, and a checkbox for tobacco use if theyre 18 or older.

Negative 57129 pIm programming with OpenGL under MSVC 2010. p  pOne of my goal is to pick objects in the scene. I design it in the way like assigning each object a unique color, rendering them in a framebuffer, then reading the color where the cursor is, and the corresponding object can be acquired.p  pNow the picking is working well. However, bas long as a picking happens, the memory increases rapidlyb. In detail, the following code render objects into a framebufferp  precodefor unsigned i  0 i lt objects.size i      some code computing color     Color color      for unsigned j  0 j lt objects[i].listOfPrimitives.size j              objects[i].listOfPrimitives[j]gtcolor  color           objects[i].Render     for unsigned j  0 j lt objects[i].listOfPrimitives.size j              objects[i].listOfPrimitives[j]gtcolor  colorStorage[i][j]       codepre  pwhere iobjectsi are objects to be rendered. Since every object has a certain number of primitiveswhich may be a cylinder, sphere etc., this piece of code just changes the color of each objects primitives to a unique computed one, render the object, then change it back icolorSotragei stores the original colors. And there are some code in the following to deal with the object, which Im sure has nothing to do with this issue.p  pThe irenderi method are implemented as following for most objectp  precodeglColor3ubcolor[0], color[1], color[2] glBeginGLTRIANGLES for unsigned i  0 i lt mesh.faces.size i      glNormal3dmesh.faces[i].normal.x, mesh.faces[i].normal.y, mesh.faces[i].normal.z     for unsigned j  0 j lt 3 j              glVertex3dmesh.vertices[mesh.faces[i].verts[j]].x,          mesh.vertices[mesh.faces[i].verts[j]].y,          mesh.vertices[mesh.faces[i].verts[j]].z       glEnd codepre  pBut for some object, there are some concave polygons even with holes, so I use the igluTessi group functions in GLU to render them, and to speed up the rendering procedure, I use display list to that part. p  pNow, as Ive mentioned. this picking procedure increases the memory cost rapidly. There are two more phenomenons I cant explainp  ol liIf I comment line 8 in the first piece of code, the memory will not change at all when the piece of code runs of course, this code will not workli liAfter the memory increases, if I do some refresh to the scene I design an interactive trackball, the memory will drop off again.li ol  pSo Im wondering which part could be the reason of this issue The display list the gluTess calling or even something related to framebufferp

Negative 57129 pIm currently developing a 3D game which should simulate deformable 3D objects. With deformable, I mean that the geometry of the 3D object is changing from frame to frame. In the game is a rendering loop which should get executed as often as possible at least 30 timessecond to get a descend frame rate. But Im also doing two other things in this rendering loop Calculating new geometry and calculating an axis aligned bounding box hierarchy AABVH. I need the AABVH for collision detection. It is very important that the geometry and AABVH calculations are complete before the 3D object gets rendered. Calculating the new geometry and AABVH is a time consuming task so my frame rate drops rapidly. My idea was therefore to calculate the AABVH in a seperate thread. This looks like thisp  precodeThread t public void RenderObject3D o  renders 3D object    if t  null  wait until the new geometry got calculated         t.Join      o.RenderGeometry   t  new Thread gt o.CalcAABVH   t.Start  codepre  pIm not an experte in parallel programming in C but Im sure that this is not a good solution. Every frame, a new Thread gets created, executed and destroyed which causes a big overhead. How would a good solution look like in my casep

Negative 57129 pIm currently using Visual Studio Premium 2013 Update 3 with Team Foundation Server Online and using a Git Repo.  Ive been using the Git Repo successfully for months up until recently.  Now whenever I save a file, Visual Studio acts like the file was checkedin.  Files no longer show in Included Changes, Excluded Changes, or Untracked Files once theyve been saved.  I added around 6 new projects to the solution today and every one of them startedout with the proper add icon, but upon working in Studio and saving files throughout the day, they all now have a lock icon and show as Checked In.  p  pI can remove a project or file and add it back, which causes the checkout symbol, but as soon as I save all changes, theyre back to checkedin.p  pSync with the online repo doesnt propagate the changes so theyre not really being recognized as checkedin changes.p  pHas anyone else experienced this issue and found a solutionp  pUPDATE This is likely specific to renaming the solution file.  I had renamed the solution file and after doing this the problem occurred.  After following the steps listed in the answer below and committingsyncing with the online repository, opening the solution back up now works normally again.p

Negative 57129 pIm using requireJS in Rails application with coderequirejsrailscode gem. What Im trying to achieve is to create several bundles which contain common code. For example codelibsa, libsb, libsc, ...code Then for some pages of the application create own bundles which contain modules related only to those pages. Problem is that all common modules should be listed for each page to exclude them from optimized files, likep  precode configrequirejs.yml  modules    in libs all dependencies should be included    name libsa     ...    name libsb     ...    name libsc     ...    in pages all dependencies should be excluded since all of them are already in libs    name pagea     include [a1, a2, a3, ...]     exclude [libsa, libsb, libsc, ...]    name pageb     include [b1, b2, b3, ...]     exclude [libsa, libsb, libsc, ...] bundles   libsa [...]   libsb [...]   libsc [...]   ... codepre  pWith large number of modules it becomes a bit cumbersome. As I understood there is no option to include in optimized file only those modules which are listed in build config and skip all dependencies. So that repeating codeexclude [libsa,...]code could be avoided. How do you solve such problemp

Negative 57129 pSo Im building a Sprite Kit game and at a certain point I want to enabledisable gravity on some of my nodes.p  pI managed to do it but I just was wondering if there is a better way to achieve this.p  pHeres my codep  precodefunc enableGravity      for rawBubble in container.children          let bubble  rawBubble as SKShapeNode         bubble.physicsBody.dynamic  true       codepre  pWhen not using type inference on rawBubble, I get this error  codeSKPhysicsBody does not have a member named dynamiccodep  pI guess this is not really a Sprite Kit related issue but more Swift itself. Is it possible to do this in a more simple wayp  pThanks.p

I use TcpListener to listen the connections and use TcpClient to  save the connected client in a listlike list so I could manage the clients with this list.It works well. And then I program a button to send messages to clients. It also worked. After all this,I take my further step to build a thread when each client connect my server. And Im trying to listen every message from the client and analyze every single one that I could request then automatically. But after I write the same code of the message sending button to the threads. It just not work like that.

I guess the error is because the values rayAX and rayBX are  very close to each other. My question is Can I get a more precise result when calculating the intersectionp

Negative 57129 pSo this is something I could not find when searching online, the MSDN is pretty hard to navigate through, and I dont really know how to word what I am looking for in the first place.  If this answer is elsewhere and someone can direct me I would appreciate that and delete this question accordingly.p  pSo I have a template class derived from vector.  The class uses two templates, one of which is a primitive and the second is a template struct that uses the primitive as its template argument.  My question is that when I turn on the debugger neither local nor auto or any of the other tabs show the members inside the struct, which are sitting inside the vectors data member.  Is there a way to make those pieces of information visible  I cant just mouse over things because the vector class has different index points and I want to be able to read the members at every index point.  Is Visual Studio just not capable of this kind of advanced debugging capabilities  Any answers would be appreciated.p  pAlso this is a code visual of the data members I am trying to access in the debuggerp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt struct qElem      T Data     int Priority     qElemT data, int priority Datadata, Prioritypriority   template ltclass T, class T2gt class PriQueue  public vectorltT2gt codepre  pemNOTEem I am trying to see what is inside qElem.Data and qElem.Priority inside all indexed instances of PriQueue[index], including all currently made types of PriQueue.p  pMy code works btw, I just am wondering if the debugger is capable of giving this information as I continue to add new functionality to it for the purpose of squashing bugs.p

Negative 57129 pim relatively new to HTMLJavascriptJava and so far i found a solution for all my beginner problems... But this already took me some hours of try and error  In my application the client fills out a form which is then transmitted via submit button to the server bean.p  pThe problem is, that the pcommandButton marked in the code below does not execute the method expression from actionListener. Executing javascript code in the oncomplete or onsuccess property works, but since i want to invoke a backed bean method after the form submission i think the actionListener property would be the right choice.. if it worked. It is maybe important to mention, that the form is inside a primefaces dialog window.p  pJust let me know if you need maybe more information like javascript or java code..p  pDoes someone know what the problem is Thanks in advance.p  pHeres some code to illustrate my Problem..p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt  lthtml

Negative 57129 pI am working on a program to play video in Java  using vlcj. I created program both in windows and ubuntu succesfully. The problem is I can play video without vlc installed in windows but not in ubuntu .I have shipped the  necessary library files required for both windows and ubuntu. Can you guys tell me what all additional library files are necessary if required since I am familiar with windows only. I included all the necessary files including plugins in homeusrlibvlc directory, is there any other path vlc library files might be installed so I can include them also. Thanks in advancep

According to my code, it would ideally be going rightup in my game, once it hits the banner on the extreme top, it should go downright, thus both the X and the Y positions will increase. But what happens is that is starts bouncing really fast, after debugging I realised it was forever stuck in the first if, its almost as if it collides 2 times, reverting Y to its initial movement, colliding a 3rd time, and doing the process over and over.p  pWhich brings us to the question, how can I make the Update code run a tad bit slower, or after half a second or such passes, so when it runs, it doesnt misinterpret collisions Thanks a lotp
Negative 57129 pIm trying to connect, as the question suggests, an Android device to a Digest secured server with websockets but I keep getting 401 Unauthorized returns. p  pI have managed to POST and GET to the same server using apache.http which supports Digest and can continue to send these basic commands by returning the cookies received during the initial request but these same cookies dont work when I send them with the websocket handshake.p  pIve sniffed the packets and can see that, as expected, even the successful connection starts with a 401 from which the apache library extracts the necessary information and resends an Authorization header with all the Digest hashes etc. This returns a new, approved response with the cookies that Im grabbing and storing for future use.p  pMy assumption is that in the change from an http address to a ws address I need to reauthenticate but I havent found an android websocket library that supports authentication and those that i have found and tested dont let me see the servers 401 response again, seen that it exists by sniffing the packets between the two and it contains all the information I need to generate a new Digest response even if that means writing it myself.p  pAny helpsuggestions would be gratefully appreciated.p  pRelevant but unsuccessful questions I still have openp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27166258openwebsocketconnectionwithauthenticationcookieOpen WebSocket connection with authentication cookieap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22692763websocketsandcookiesinandroidlq1Websockets and cookies in Androidap  pTested Librariesp  pAutobahnp  pAndroidAsyncp  pJavaWebsocket Currently pushing on with thisp

Negative 57129 pConsider the following situation. There is a group of people working on a task for example, editing a map. Any person is allowed to see the whole map. Every person is considered to be the owner of a certain piece of map they created. If person A created piece of map MA, and person B wants to change that piece, they can edit it locally and then can offer their changes to A. If A accepts the changes, the new MA is distributed to the whole team. B is not allowed to submit changes to MA themselves by definition.p  pAs you can see, its some sort of collaborative or distributed editing, where every bit of the task has an owner, and others may offer changes, which then should be propagated.p  pSince I have 0 knowledge about how to properly design a system and which rules should be applied and our course has 0 material on that as well, which is weird indeed, but thats how it is  meaning, go figure out yourself, I would like to ask your opinion on the subjectp  ul liwhat is the general class of such systems called in software designli liwhich styles and patterns should be used in systems like thisli ul  pIm 100 sure that this has been designed before, and that there is a correct implementation that one should use.p  pP.S. I sincerely hope that this is not going to be closed as homework, since a Im not asking you to do it for me, only advice or opinion and b this is about the only place where I can ask for advice on this topic.p  pP.P.S. I strongly believe that there are strict rules in OO analysis and design and strict criteria to measure design correctness, hence why I dont want to just make up some random design with 0 knowledge, but rather to know how to approach things correctly in the first place.

Negative 57129 pI have a setup where the user can define products like MacBook Pro. Each codeProductcode gets instantiated to create a physical item codeProductInstancecode which gets a serial number. Pretty simple so far.p  pI want the user to be able to define other types of unique identifiers, like MAC addresses, VIN, social security number, etc. I call this a codeUIDTypecode. Each Product can have zero or more of any codeUIDTypecode. These need to be differentiated somehow  by assigning a namedescription and linking to both the codeProductcode and the codeUIDTypecode codeUIDProductInfocode. To actually assign values I need to assign a value to a codeUIDProductInfocode for a specific codeProductInstancecode  this is done with the codeUIDcode model.p  pWhen the user instantiates a product creates a codeProductInstancecode, they should be forced to create one and only one codeUIDcode for each codeUIDProductInfocode of the codeProductcode theyre instantiating.

The forms in the codeUIDcode formset need to create a codeUIDcode thats bound to each of the codeUIDProductInfocode objects associated with the codeProductcode and to the newly created codeProductInstancecode. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to do that. I tried using the codeinitialcode parameter when creating the formset in the codeCreateViewcodes codegetcontextdatacode method, and a few other more kludgey approaches but I just cant get the formset created properly.p  pThanks for your help.

Negative 57129 pIve noticed that chrome has been slowing down requests a ton when sent rapidly from either the console, or from the same extension.p  pTo test, I experimented by sending a request at a 25 millisecond interval in one extension. Sure enough, the requests slowed down majorly from the starting point at taking about 3060ms to load, to the point where it would just say Pending and take up to 10 seconds to complete the request. However, when I tried splitting this into two identical chrome extensions, both of which sent requests to the same server, but this time, both had a 50ms interval, the requests were much faster, averaging at around 4070ms per request.p  pIm assuming that chrome is throttling requests sent from either the console or from a single extension, is there any way to disable this I found the command flag codedisableextensionshttpthrottlingcode, but Ive had the same issue when using it.p

Negative 57129 pI am looking for a methodology of how to deploy applications, websites and web services from codeDEVcode to codeITGcode and codePROcode. I am not referring only to files included in the projects, but also settings from codeIIScode, filesfolders permissions, etc.p  pFor example, this weekend we had to deploy a new application from codeITGcode to codePROcode, and codePRO AppPoolcode was set to run code.NET 2.0code from previous version. It took us sometime to realize what was going on, leading of course to a longer downtime than expected.p  pCurrently we are using codeVS 2013code, codeC 4.xcode, codeIIS 8.xcode and codeTFS 2013code. The question here is, if there is a way to deploy an application with a single click. Is codeMSBuildcode suitable for this task I have no experience on codeMSBuildcode, I just found some stuff while Googling, and I am wondering if I need to go deeper. Can TFS read those settings from the source machine and copy them on the target somehow Is there any other tool than can complete this task We would like to stay inside Microsofts circle, however if something else does exactly that, we might consider it.p

For example I often use jstack to print the list of threads within a particular java process, etc.p  pQuestion  Do you know of any alternatives to them, or did Oracle simply removed them without providing anything instead p  pstrongEdit 1strongp  pApparently, this happens in the server JRE version like this one a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comotnjavajdk8u51b16serverjre8u51linuxx64.tar.gz relnofollowhttpdownload.oracle.comotnjavajdk8u51b16serverjre8u51linuxx64.tar.gza, but not in the JDK versions. This is different than java 1.7, where server JRE also included those files.p  pWhile the reasoning behind this now makes a lot more sense, Im still wondering if theres alternative tools like jmapjstack in server JRE it seems a bit troublesome to install a jdk on a server, just to look at some thread infop

Negative 57129 pIm creating an iOS app with a Rails server to store and sync user information across devices.p  pJust as an example, lets say my user has an email to uniquely identify himself and a list of placesp  precode     email ...,     places [                      id ...,             name ...,             latitude ...,             longitude ...,             category ...         ,         ...     ]  codepre  pIn my iOS app I have the codeUsercode and codePlacecode entitiesclasses.p  pShould I also have a codePlacecode activerecord entity in Rails with the parameters name, latitude, longitude, category in the migration or should I just have a codePlacecode entity with codeidcode and codedatacode, codedatacode being a hash that would contain the keys name, latitude, longitude and categoryp  pOne advantage I see with the second approach is that if I update my models in the iOS App, I dont have to also update it in the Rails server, because it is only storing a hash for each place.p  pWhat should I dop
Negative 57129 pLets say that have 2 DNX projects A and B. Both of these projects are stored in separate repositories and are published as nuget packages.p  pProject A depends on project B. Under normal circumstances Project A would just pull project Bs nuget package.p  pThere is an instance where Id like to work on both Project A and project B at the same time. Id like to be able to be able to make changes to project B and use those changes in project A without having to build a package deploy it and then pull it.p  pI know that in the Ruby world, its possible to do this with bundler. You can tell it to use a local directory instead of a dependency. I have also heard that its also possible to do something similar with bower.p  pIs such a thing possible with DNX. If so, how would I go about doing thisp
