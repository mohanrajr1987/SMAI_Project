Positive 2848 pSo in ObjectiveC when using Booleans its possible, and encouraged, to write code using a variables nonzero value as its boolean value, which means you can write code like thisp  precodeif someBool       Stuff  codepre  pAlso, there are reasons why code like the following is discouragedp  precodeif someBool  YES       Might run into problems here  codepre  pThe reasons why checking a boolean against another boolean are better explained a hrefhttpswww.bignerdranch.comblogboolssharpcornersherea, but briefly the issue is just that when youre comparing equality to codeYEScode or codeNOcode directly, youre actually comparing against code1code and code0code, respectively. Since ObjectiveC allows for using nonzero values as a truth value, you could end up comparing something that should be considered true against codeYEScode and have the expression resolve to codeNOcode, e.g.p  precodeint trueNumber  2 if trueNumber  YES       Doesnt run because trueNumber  1  codepre  pIs this still an issue in Swift Code style issues aside, if I see something like the followingp  precodevar someBool  true if someBool  true       stuff  codepre  pis that going to be an issue, or does it not really matter Are these Cstyle comparisons still happening under the hood, or is there something built into the Swift BooleanType that prevents these issuesp

Positive 2848 pThis one will be quick, I have to make a program that checks to see if a password is valid or not. It has to be atleast 8 characters, have one lower, one upper case char, and atleast one special char to be valid. Otherwise, the password will be invalid. Everything seems to be alright, however it doesnt seem to ever checkout as valid even when it is. I feel like it has to do with the character location or something but I cannot pin what it is exactly.

Positive 2848 pSo, I recently got into programming in python and decided to make a simple code which ran some simple maths e.g calculating the missing angle in a triangle and other simple things like that. After I made the program and a few others, I thought that maybe other people I know could use this so I decided to try and make this as simple as possible. The code can be found belowp  precodea  intinputWhats one of the angles b  intinputWhats the other angle in the triangle c  a  b d  180 f  int180  c printf codepre  pThe code itself does work but, the only problem is that if you have more than 1 question, it becomes tedious and a rather cumbersome task to constantly load up Python and hit F5 so, my idea was to have it loop an infinite number of times until you decided to close down the program. Every time I tried searching for a way to do this, all of the while True statements were for bigger and more complicated pieces of code and with this being maybe my fifth or tenth piece of code, I couldnt understand a few of the coding for it.p  pId appreciate any help or advice for this subject as itd make my day if anyones willing to help.p

Negative 2848 pI am building a web application using .NET 3.5 ASP.NET, SQL Server, C, WCF, WF, etc and I have run into a major design dilemma. This is a uni project btw, but it is 100 up to me what I develop.p  pI need to design a system whereby I can take an image and automatically crop a certain object within it, without user input. So for example, cut out the car in a picture of a road. Ive given this a lot of thought, and I cant see any feasible method. I guess this thread is to discuss the issues and feasibility of achieving this goal. Eventually, I would get the dimensions of a car or whatever it may be, and then pass this into a 3d modelling app custom as parameters, to render a 3d model. This last step is a lot more feasible. Its the cropping issue which is an issue. I have thought of all sorts of ideas, like getting the colour of the car and then the outline around that colour. So if the car example is yellow, when there is a yellow pixel in the image, trace around it. But this would fail if there are two yellow cars in a photo.p  pIdeally, I would like the system to be completely automated. But I guess I cant have everything my way. Also, my skills are in what I mentioned above .NET 3.5, SQL Server, AJAX, web design as opposed to C but I would be open to any solution just to see the feasibility.p  pI also found this patent a hrefhttpwww.patentstorm.uspatents7034848.html relnofollowUS Patent 7034848  System and method for automatically cropping graphical imagesap  pThanksp

Negative 2848 pThe documentation says that the clipsToBounds property of UIView will clip the drawing to the bounds, or more precisely that the subview cant draw outside of the bounds of the superview.p  pSounds nice, but what does that mean in practise If I set that to YES, then my subview will automatically only draw those parts which are not outside the bounds of the superview, so it increases the overall performance Or do I still have to make sure that I dont create any views that are not visible, i.e. inside a UIScrollViewp

Negative 2848 pHi already wrote this observation and question on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions319530restfulauthentication11359951135995this questiona earlier, but only later noticed that it was an old and dead question. As Id really like some insights from others, Im reposting it as a new question.p  pTo the question of how to do authentication RESTfully, people generally enthousiastically shout HTTP Authentication. However, I sorf of doubt whether those people ever tried making a browserbased emapplicationem instead of a machinetomachine web service with REST. no offense intended  I just dont think they ever faced the complications p  pProblems that I found with using HTTP Authentication on RESTful services that produce HTML pages to be viewed in a browser arep  ul liuser typically gets an ugly browsermade login box, which is veyr userunfriendly. you cannot add password retrieval, help boxes, etcetera.li lilogging out or logging in under a different name is a problem  browsers will keep sending authentication information to the site until you close the windowli litimeouts are difficultli ul  pA very insightful article that tackles these point by point is a hrefhttpwww.berenddeboer.netrestauthentication.htmlherea, but this results to a emlotem of browserspecific javascript hackery, workarounds to workarounds, etcetera. As such, it is also not forwardcompatible so will require constant maintenance as new browsers are released. I do not consider that clean and clear design, plus I feel it is a lot of extra work and headache just so that I can enthousiastically show my RESTbadge to my friends.p  pI believe that cookies are the solution. But wait, cookies are evil, arent they No theyre not, the way cookies are used often is evil. A cookie itself is just a piece of clientside information, just like the HTTP authentication info that the browser would keep track of while you browse. And this piece of clientside information is sent to the server at every request, again just like the HTTP Authentication info would be. Conceptually, the only difference is that the emcontentem of this piece of clientside state can be determined by the emserverem as part of its response.p  pBy making sessions a RESTful resource with just the following rulesp  ul liA emsessionem maps a key to a user id and possibly a lastactiontimestamp for timeoutsli liIf a emsessionem exists, then that means that the key is valid.li liLogin means POSTing to sessions, a new key is set as a cookieli liLogout means DELETEing sessionskey with overloaded POST, remember, were a browser and HTML 5 is a long way to go yetli liAuthentication is done by sending the key as a cookie at every request and checking whether the session exists and is validli ul  pThe only difference to HTTP Authentication, now, is that the authentication key is generated by the server and sent to the client who keeps sending it back, instead of the client computing it from the entered credentials.p  pI feel that this is a sufficient solution that works fine, but I must admit that Im not enough of a security expert to identify potential holes in this scheme  all I know is that hundreds of nonRESTful web applications use essentially the same login protocol SESSION inphp, HttpSession in j2ee, etc. The cookie header contents is simply used to address a serverside resource, just like an acceptlanguage might be used to access translation resources, etcetera. I feel that it is the same, but maybe others dont What do you think, guysp

Negative 2848 pAs a learning exercise Ive hacked together a script for an SO a hrefhttpmeta.stackexchange.comquestions13847displaystatisticshavesubjectbadgesforacceptedanswers1606216062feature requesta for the purposes of this question please ignore the merits or otherwise of that request. In the script Ive encountered a technical issue that my limited javascript knowledge cant get past and Id appreciate suggestions on how to resolve it.p  pTo avoid spamming the server I use some search hacks to determine the number of answers and accepted answers for a tag. This involves using window.setTimeout to callback to a function that sends a get request for each tag, increasing the timeout on each call to stagger the requests.p  pTo get the results in a single request involves appending amppagesize1 to the end of the url in the get request, so that the number of pages in the results gives you the total number of results without having to make any further requests. p  pA side affect of this approach is that subsequent page views use amppagesize1 and I only see a single entry. I attempt to resolve this by firing another query with amppagesize30 to reset it afterwards, but as it is all asynchronous the timing of the last query can result in the pagesize either being 1 or 30, depending on which request completes first. Ive tried adding a further timeout and callback for this reset query but it hasnt really helped.p  pIs there a means to monitor the queries, waiting until all have been completed, then once they have all completed send the reset request Or is there another approach that I could takep

Negative 2848 pWhen I read about the performance of JITted languages like C or Java, authors usually say that they shouldcould theoretically outperform many nativecompiled applications.  The theory being that native applications are usually just compiled for a processor family like x86, so the compiler cannot make certain optimizations as they may not truly be optimizations on all processors.  On the other hand, the CLR can make processorspecific optimizations during the JIT process.p  pDoes anyone know if Microsofts or Monos CLR actually performs processorspecific optimizations during the JIT process  If so, what kind of optimizationsp

Negative 2848 pIm writing a wxWidgets GUI application, but it also uses some console objects.p  pI need a way of displaying stdout and accessing stdin the best way to do this, would be displaying the console as well as the GUI.  This can be done if a user runs the program from the command promptshell etc, but the command prompt does not automatically open to view stdout when the application is ran.p  pI know this has to be possible, because when you run a console application, the console runs automatically.  I found one or two solutions that require the Windows API, but sadly my code needs to be cross platform Im developing this on Linux.p
Negative 2848 phibr I need to determine if a given selection is in between a start line and an end line. I have an codeILineRangecode and a given offset within the viewport of eclipse. I need to know, if the selection from a remote party was made within the current viewport of the local user. Unfortunately, I cannot get an codeILineRangecode from the selection. I must rely on getOffset and getLength...br Anyone has an idea br I think there is not a clean solution for this, as the offset or the characters per line vary new line lines or a big block of comment.p
Negative 2848 pI am trying to drag and drop UIViews within a UIScrollView. Id like the UIScrollView to scroll if I drag a UIView so that it intersects the top or bottom of the ScrollView. If it touches the top, it should scroll up. If it touches the bottom, it should scroll down. Once the UIView is moved such that it is no longer intersecting the top or bottom, the scrolling should stop.p  pThe first approach I tried was to start an NSTimer whenever I detected that the UIView intersected with the top or bottom of the scrollview. The timer would scroll the UIScrollView bit by bit until it was invalidated. This resulted in very jerky scrolling, since there is no way to predict when the timers will fire.p  pMy current approach is to simply scroll all the way to the top or bottom of the ScrollView, like thisp  precode[UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL] [UIView setAnimationCurveUIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut] [UIView setAnimationDuration1.0] [self.parentScrollview setContentOffsetnewOffset animatedNO] [UIView commitAnimations] codepre  pIn order to stop scrolling, I try to determine the position of the touch in the touchesMoved delegate, and use that to calculate the contentOffset to use for the scrollView.p  pThe problem is, when I try to get the location in the view via [[touches anyObject] locationInViewself], I get the final end location, rather than the current location. Im guessing thats because the contentOffset on the scrollView is set immediately.p  pIs there a way to get the actual location of a touch in a situation like this Or any other way to set the contentOffset when I interrupt the scrolling animationp

Negative 2848 pI wanted to keep my logging statements as short as possible while preventing console from being accessed when it doesnt exist I came up with the following solutionp  precodevar    if console      .log  console.debug  else      .log  function    codepre  pTo me, this seems quite elegant, and it works great in Firefox 3.6 including preserving the line numbers that make codeconsole.debugcode more useful than codeconsole.logcode. But it doesnt work in Safari 4. [Update Or in Chrome. So the issue seems to be a difference between Firebug and the Webkit console.] If I follow the above withp  precodeconsole.debugA .logB codepre  pthe first statement works fine in both browsers, but the second generates a TypeError Type Error in Safari. Is this just a difference between how Firebug and the Safari Web Developer Tools implement console If so, it is VERY annoying on strikeApplesstrike Webkits part. Binding the console function to a prototype and then instantiating, rather than binding it directly to the object, doesnt help.p  pI could, of course, just call codeconsole.debugcode from an anonymous function assigned to code.logcode, but then Id lose my line numbers. Any other ideasp
Negative 2848 pIve created a iPhone static library project with two targets like thisp  pProjectbr  Library Device targetbr  Library simulator targetp  pThe device target has the SDK set to the device so it produces an armv67 library and the simulator target is set to the simulator SDK so it produces an i386 library.p  pThe issue Im having is that the SDK settings on the targets keep getting overridden by the XCode active target setting. i.e. if I build the device target, but the XCode window is showing the active SDK as being the simlulator, XCode will build a simulator library instead of a device library, ignoring the settings of the target. Although it will put it into the iphoneos directory in the build directories p  pI originally had the same issue with another static library project, and after a lot of playing around got everything to work correctly. i.e. The targets ignore the XCode active SDK because they have their own specifications of what to build.p  pThe problem is that I dont know what made it work in that project and I have not been able to reproduce the issue in it either.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to what is going onp  pciao Derekp

Negative 2848 pIn my current job Im building a suite of Perl scripts that depend heavily on objects. using Perls codeblesscode on a Hash to get as close to OO as possible p  pNow, for lack of a better way of putting this, most programmers at my company arent very smart. Worse, they dont like reading documentation and seem to have a problem understanding other peoples code. Cowboy coding is the game here. Whenever they encounter a problem and try to fix it, they come up with a horrendous solution that actually solves nothing and usually makes it worse.p  pThis results in me, frankly, not trusting them with code written in duck typed language. As an example, I see too many problems with them not getting an explicit error for misusing objects. For instance, if type codeAcode has member codefoocode, and they do something like, codeinstancegtgoocode, they arent going to see the problem immediately. It will return a nullundefined value, and they will probably waste an hour finding the cause. Then end up changing something else because they didnt properly identify the original problem.p  pSo Im brainstorming for a way to keep my scripting language its rapid development is an advantage but give an explicit error message when an object isnt used properly. I realize that since there isnt a compile stage or static typing, the error will have to be at run time. Im fine with this, so long as the user gets a very explicit notice saying this object doesnt have Xp  pAs part of my solution, I dont want it to be required that they check if a methodvariable exists before trying to use it.  p  pEven though my work is in Perl, I think this can be language agnostic. p

Negative 2848 pFor examplep  ol liLibrary symbol Card is linked to class Card which extends MovieClip.  Library symbol Card contains a card background image.li liLibrary symbol Ace is linked to class Ace, which extends class Card.  Library symbol Ace contains a TextField with a big letter A.li ol  pSo we have  Ace extends Card which extends MovieClip.  Ace therefore extends MovieClip, but does not DIRECTLY extend MovieClip.p  pWhen I drop an instance of Ace on the stage and compile the clip, all that shows up is the big letter A.  However, I expected the background image from Card to be included, since Ace extends Card, and the Card symbol contains the background.p  pIt seems like Flash ignores symbol content unless it belongs to the toplevel class being instantiated.  I think its LAME that one symbol cant extend another.  The IDE could easily draw Card as a noneditable background while Im editing Ace which extends it, and it should instantiate Cards content and then Aces content when an Ace is instantiated.  Thoughtsp

Negative 2848 pIm currently working on a program that is converting an old database to a newer style and one of the tasks Ive been assigned is to remove some old binary columns and convert those into documents in our repository.p  pWe have about 1.1 million rows in the table and my process takes about 12 hours to complete.p  pIm looking for ways to make this all go a little faster and one thing Im looking at is getting at the data quicker.  If there a way I can get to the results of my query before it has completed  Ive noticed that when I run a select  statement against this table in Query Analyzer I start getting results back immediately, but when I use ExecuteReader in .NET that query seems to take around 30 minutes before I can start reading the rows.p

Negative 2848 pI have a question about my ActiveX control not always working in IE on other machines.p  pstrongContextstrong Im working on an internal app for my company. It is designed to be a standalone webpage config tool for viewing a static customized version of our web app. The user may select the colors, images, and other settings they would like to see, and these will be present in the static mockuppreview version on their machine when they click a button.p  pstrongImplementationstrong my javascript file creates a filesystemactivex object that essentially creates a temporary javascript file to which a list of values are written. Then when the user previews the configuration, the javascript file is located and values are loaded dynamically into the dom, etc etc. Naturally this functionality only works in Internet Explorer and is shady at best, but is my only way of implementing a purely zero configuration, clientside dynamic webapp.p  pstrongProblemstrong When I test out my script, Internet Explorer prompts me twice about ActiveX controls and I say yes to them and the ActiveX functions work. I do this every single time I open my page. But sometimes when I send the file to another person so they can use it, they dont get the notifications so it doesnt work. However sometimes they do get notifications and it emdoesem work I am using default security settings for IE so there should be no difference between my settings and theirs.p  pCould this be related to my user permissions vs theirs, or the fact that the files are readonly because they are coming from source control and are also being made readonly when put on the shared drive. or unknown dark Microsoft forces beyond human comprehensionp  pThanks, Joshp
Negative 2848 pWhen reading through some answers to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4757565cforwarddeclarationthis questiona, I started wondering why the compiler actually emdoesem need to know about a function when it first encounters it. Wouldnt it be simple to just add an extra pass when parsing a compilation unit that collects all symbols declared within, so that the order in which they are declared and used does not matter anymorep  pOne could argue, that declaring functions before they are used certainly is good style, but I am wondering, is there are any other reason why this is mandatory in Cp  pstrongEdit  An example to illustratestrong Suppose you have to functions that are defined inline in a header file. These two function call each other maybe a recursive tree traversal, where odd and even layers of the tree are handled differently. The only way to resolve this would be to make a forward declaration of one of the functions before the other.p  pA more common example though with classes, not functions is the case of classes with codeprivatecode constructors and factories. The factory needs to know the class in order to create instances of it, and the class needs to know the factory for the codefriendcode declaration.p  pIf this is requirement is from the olden days, why was it not removed at some point It would not break existing code, would itp

Negative 2848 pWe have a large development team, and was wondering if theres a method to configure VS2010 to block conversion of VS2008 projects to VS2010.  The goal is to ensure that folks dont make a potentially large mistake by converting projects that should remain on VS2008.   Folks could use VS2010 to work on solutions originally created in VS2010 only.  One or two people on a team may be appointed as the ones who can do the conversion.p  pIve done a bit of searching hoping to find a registry key to enable this functionality, but so far no luck.p  pIn an ideal world folks would be experienced enough to not make this kind of problem, and TFS will definitely ensure theres a recovery path, but it would be nice if we use studio to help prevent this from becoming an issue.p
Negative 2848 pI have somewaht of a strange problem. I am not sure if I am screwing up or if this maybe even is a bug in webkit.p  pWhat I am doing is using some more or less complex CSS tricks after and content, sibling selector, etc and custom dataattributes to indicate if the input fields of a form are valid or not.br I have a data attribute datavalid on each input field together with an attribute datavalidate, which contains a regular expression. On keyup I run the regular expression against the value of the input and set datavalid accordingly.  I then have a small div next to the input, that is styled using a datavalid sensitive attribute selector. The background will show an ok symbol if the siblings input datavalid attribute is true and will show a fail symbol if it is set to false.p  pBecause this might be hard to understand, I stitched together this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netWHewK relnofollowemjsfiddleema, so you can look at it yourself.  p  pAll this works perfectly fine in Firefox 6 and IE9. However, in both Webkit based browsers Chrome  Safari this will not work 100 correctly. Allthough the datavalid attribute changes correctly, the styled div will not change its appearance until I either input additional characters or unfocus the input field. It nearly looks like the Webkit browsers fail to repaint  restyle that particular div.p  pI really dont know whats going on, I am rather confident, that this emshouldem work as I expect it to. I hope someone can come up with some insight or even explaination and maybe a fixworkaround.p  pThanks alotp

The idea was to make an interface that each class could use within the set, but ultimately each class is different.  Turns out interfaces do not like shared members.  What I triedp  precodePublic Interface ISomeInterface Shared Property Meta as Object End Interface   Public Class A  Implements ISomeInterface Shared Public Property Meta as Object Implements ISomeInterFace.Meta Setget methods End Propery  Public Function Haduken as Object perform Haduken End Function End Class   Public Class B  Implements ISomeInterface Shared Public Property Meta as Object Implements ISomeInterFace.Meta Setget methods End Propery  Public Function SonicBoom as Object perform sonic boom End Function End Class codepre  pObviously, had I done my homework on this, I would have known that shared members cant be use in interfaces.  Should I just leave the individual classes completely responsible for handling its shared members  Is there another way to keep coupling down to a minimum with shared members  Theres about 20 something or so classes that will implement a single interface.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2848 pIf you go to a hrefhttpjsbin.comibozun2 relnofollowhttpjsbin.comibozun2a, hit Add Item, and then hit Save, you will see that a second dialog is opened on top of the first one.  The form in the dialog is posting to itself no action defined  this is by design.  Because the dialog has duplicated itself, now you have to hit Cancel 2 times to get it to close.p  pThe usecase for this setup is a MS MVC3 page with unobtrusive JQuery validation on it.  The default scripts in other words, I have no custom validators  the scripts are straight from MS cause an ajax call to the server, and JQM treats that the same as a selfposting form  so you wind up with a duplicate dialog if validation fails.p  pA similar thing happens if the second page as a page, rather than a dialog  the form posting to itself results in a second history entry in the browser, so to get back to page 1, you have to hit back 2 times.p  pI believed this be a bug in JQM, but after submitting a bug on GitHub, I was told that this is the expected behavior.  So, assuming this behavior that will not be changing in the framework, how do I prevent this from happening for my instance preferring NOT to edit the framework JS  Do I have to write my own ajax calls for validation so that I can prevent JQM from knowing that anything has happened  That seems unfortunate...  p  pOne idea I had was to detect that the nextPage and current page are the same on pageHide, and manipulate the dialoghistory myself, but have had no luck.p  pThanks in advancep

Not sure if a direct call to an Arel table would help or hurt, but I am open to ideas.p  pIf we get it right, the resulting SQL should effectively look something likep  precodeSELECT sumhours  minutes60.0 FROM employees e1 join employees e2 on e1.id  e2.mergeparentid join timesheets t on t.employeeid  e2.id WHERE e1.id  [employee.id] and t.transactiondate BETWEEN [range.begin] and [range.end] codepre  pThanks so muchp

Negative 2848 pThe title may not be very clear so its perhaps best to explain what Im trying to do.p  pI have a C shared library which is used by several of my applications. I now want to use the functions in my shared library in PostgreSQL, so I am writing an extension library for PostgreSQL v8.4.p  pTo prevent duplicity of code following the DRY philosophy, I want the extension library to be simply a thin API around the core shared library I described above. Therein lies the issue.p  pIn my core library, I make MANY calls to memory mgmt funcs mostly calloc and realloc. PostgreSQL on the other hand, has its own memory management funcs like palloc, pfree etc. p  pIdeally, I want the PG extension lib to call into the core lib. When PG calls are executing, I want the core library to be using the postgresql mem functions, and when my other applications are invoking functions, I want the core library to be using the standard C mem functions.p  pI dont know if this is possible it would certainly save me having to duplicate the entire existing code for the core library. I think adding some defines in the header file of the core library like sop  precodeifdef BUILDINGPGXTLIB  define calloc   palloc0  define realloc  prealloc  define free     pfree endif codepre  pand then recompiling the core library. However upon later reflection, I realize that this solves the problem at compile time, not run time unless Im mistaken  so Ive run out of ideas on how to tackle this problem.p  pCan this be done. If so, howp

Negative 2848 pIn my application I have codeViewcode that observes codeModelcode changes. codeControllercode is responsible for handling events dispatched by codeViewcode and updating codeModelcode.p  pFor the sake of example, lets suppose I have two views. First, codeInputViewcode, contains two codeJSpinnercode elements codeSpinner1code and codeSpinner2code. Second, codeResultViewcode, contains codeJLabelcode with values from spinners. And as additional constraint, we want to have values of codeSpinner2code be dependent on values of codeSpinner1code. Lets say, that minimum value in codeSpinner2code should be code2xcode current value of codeSpinner1code. p  pWhen we change value of codeSpinner1code codeControllercode receives codeChangeEventcode and updates codeModelcode. Since we also have to adjust value of codeSpinner2code another codeChangeEventcode will be dispatched and codeModelcode will be updated second time. The problem with this schema is that with each codeModelcode update the observing codeViewcode refreshes. So, in this example the codeViewcode would refresh 3 or 4 times instead of one codeSpinner1code change, codeSpinner2code minimum value change, codeSpinner2code value change. This causes flickering. p  pHow to I make sure the codeViewcode updates only once when all changes are donep

Negative 2848 pIm developing a game for Android, and making an OpenGL text drawing subsystem for it for performance reasons. Instead of using a ttf file, I put Arial letters to a big OpenGL texture and when drawing text, each letter is mapped from that big texture this is what makes instant text drawing very fast.p  pGUI texts use fonts normally, but I use freeware commercially usable ttf files for that. So the question is only about the above selfgenerated font texture.p  pIs it allowed to use Arial in this way i.e. that its letters are generated into a texture file Its going to be a commercial game. p  pIt probably doesnt matter anyway that theyre added to a texture probably the question would remain the same if I just used an Arial ttf. The question is, can Arial be used on Android for free, in commercial gamesp

When I close the Shell, the light on the webcam turns off.p  pI have also triedp  precodeimg.saveCpathtofilename.jpg codepre  pWhich saved the picture to the right location, but the picture was just all black.

Negative 2848 pI understand that the best way to call a method in a superclass in python is to wirtep  precodeclass FooBar     def fooself         ...         superFoo, self.foo         ... codepre  pHowever, this means that if I change the name of the class Foo or I cut and paste the code in another class I have to remember to change the line that calls the method in the super class. Is there any way to get around this At a minimum is annoying, at worst is very error prone.p

Negative 2848 pMy question is What is the exactly difference for the PHP app running on the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk called EB after.or the general instances or serversp  pI am new to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, I used to try PagodaBox.com. Is the a PaaS platform EB exactly same as PagodaBox.comp  pWhats the difference of the runtime environment between the app running on the general servers or a PaaS autoscale platform just like EBp  pI may have figure out some. I do a test both on the EB and PagodaBox.com, the PagodaBox told me they are the destination, so you have to configure your app on the local, in fact, they do not support the write operation that out of the Share Dir which has defined in Boxfile.p  pSo, is that correct and same as EB that the PaaS platform will be a quite different than the general servers which hosted your websitep  pWhen you are installing a website like wordpress on the general single server, you can config and edit the file on the serverside, your every change will affected your sourcecode or resource files whichs a part of your code. But if you are using a PaaS like pagoda, you cant even do a write operation out of the Shared Dir, that means you have to do the all at local then upload them as static code. all user data will be stored into mysql database as the same way in the general server, but all uploads should stored to a Shared Dir that defined to the Boxfile. but where should it be in EB How we store the uploaded files if we are going to deploy a wordpress based site in EB Is it going to be changing the code or we must find a own way to store a residedata since we are coding our own appp  pHow many difference when you are designing the app running on the general server or a EB platform the question might be whats the difference when your app running a distributed environmentp  pSorry, I dont speak English as well as Chinese.

Negative 2848 pIm currently developing a C MVC REST web api, and am trying to choose between one of two possibilities for our design.p  pWithout getting too deep into our design, we intend to have a class for data access, which well call codeDataSourcecode. Each codeDataSourcecode will need to execute small, contained blocks of logic to correctly build an appropriate response. Due to a desire to be able to hotload code in the future, we dont want to simply have these be functions on codeDataSourcecode, instead wed like them to be provided by other assemblies. We have a proof of concept of this implemented, and so far, so good.p  pWhat Im trying to decide between is writing a static class with a single static codeExecuteQuerycode function, or writing a factory method to create instances of these classes, which have an instance method called codeExecuteQuerycode.p  pstrongWhat are the performance considerations between creating multiple, shortlived objects every request, vs calling static methodsstrongp  pIntuitively, static methods would be faster, but Im already expecting that Ill run into a bit of a headache calling them through reflection to support the hotloaded code requirement.p  pIf theres not a huge penalty for shortlived objects, then they might win out on simplicity alone.p  pRelevant information about our expect loadsp  ul liResponse times in the 300ms  800ms rangeli liAverage load of about 2000 web clientsli liPeak load of about 4000 clientsli liClients doing queries every 2  5 secondsli liClient peak rate of 1 query every secondli ul  pAlso, each codeDataSourcecode would create a maximum of 8, average of 3 of these instances.p

Negative 2848 pI am using both JQuery Masonry and Twitter bootstrap together but experiencing a few problems. I do not think that the problem is caused by any conflict between the two. p  pI am using Bootstrap Thumbnails, to provide imagetext divs and then using Masonry to arrange them all more nicely. p  pIm keen that in the future new content inserted into each of these thumbnail divs is not constrained too much, as some of it will be dynamically loaded and I want the divs to be able to expand as they need to. I would like to have the flexibility to toggle content visibility or have flyout content on hovers etc which as it happens triggers Masonry to reset its layout positions.p  pTo test how Masonry will respond to this I have changed the CSS of the .thumbnail class so that when hovering the thumbnail div each has class .thumbnail it gains bottom padding which is forcing its height to expand.p  pWhen Masonry loads it works great and positions everything based on its initial size. p  pWhen you hover the thumbnails the css hover kicks in and makes containers expand in height but forces them to overlap the thumbnail below. p  pTo overcome this I have linked to an external .js file and have added some custom jquery, its nice and simple and just executes a function on hover over each thumbnail which tells Masonry to refreshreload. This works well while hovering over the thumbnails, the css hover kicks in, div expands and then Masonry repositions all the divs for best fit to accomodate the new div size.p  pMY PROBLEM when you then move the mouse out of the thumbnail Masonry does not recognise the change in the css hover back to its original state and so the thumbnails height reduces and leaves a gap between itself and the thumbnail below. Its like Masonry is not recognising the new height values when the Div reduces in height but does recognise when the Div height expandsp  pI am running the same function in my custom external .js for both states of the jQuery hover and was hoping that Masonry would respond okay, but has not. Any ideas p  pI define all the initial Masonry withp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt window.loadfunction     .containerfluid.masonry     itemSelector .thumbnail,     isAnimated true,     animationOptions          duration 750,         easing linear,         queue false                                     ltscriptgt   codepre  pand my custom .js file containsp  precodedocument.readyfunction .thumbnail.hover      functionrun,     functionrun                         function run .containerfluid.masonryreload codepre  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2848 pthe Solution is at the bottom of my post.p  pFirst off, let me apologise for the length of this post but Ive been pouring over the code for hours and Im lost. Im also pretty confused by the db aspects so my code duplicates some of the simplest tutorials I could find, even though I know aspects are deprecated or there are other methods which reduce the code length. I wasnt sure what was required or not, hence the large amount of code below.p  pThe goal I have a form that a user can fill in and save to a DB Table. I then display this data in another class to a ListView this class also has additional functions above the listview. By clicking on one of the listview items, another form opens that looks identical to the original form, with all the info already populated from the database row. This form has a save and delete button which either lets you change some of the entry fields EditTexts and Spinners and save to update the row, or select delete. After updating or deleting, the activity finishes and takes you back to the listview class.p  pI wont bother adding the original form data as I know that is saving correctly. I also know that my data is transferring correctly into secondary form the one I can modifydelete from, but I get the following in my logcat when trying to update or deletep  precode0729 041825.771

Negative 2848 pI do a lot of webscraping and for each project I find myself rewriting a kind of frameworkbackend that involves saving raw pagesfiles into namespaced directories, and sometimes even a database to keep track of dates, error messages, etc.p  pI was wondering if there were any such frameworks that have already been built for this kind of task. I dont mean for the actual scraping task itself, which is a combination of using HTML parsers like NokogiriMechanizeetc...but for the management of scrapers and the data they collect. For some of the tasks I do, theres stages in the datacollection.p  pFor examplep  ol liIterate through a site, download raw pagesli liParse the stored raw pages, extract datali liClean the data this can involve other external processes that may not be possible in stage 2li ol  pSo any system that helps me keep track of when scrapers started, how they did, and where they saved the raw data is great. I thought of writing my own thing using MongoDB but Im sure someone has done this better than I have.p

Negative 2848 pSo I have an interesting issue.  I have a page that allows users to select image urls from external sources.  Instead of doing this the sane way with jquery modals or something, the page in question creates a child window.  That child window can then call JS functions on the parent to insert said URLs.  p  pNow if our user happened to select a number of very specific settings and the stars are aligned just right, the parent page will display an alert box telling them something along the lines of because you selected option A, E and F, we must alter option B just slightly.p  pHere is the issue  firefox doesnt display alerts like Chrome or IE a seperate window with an ok box.  With the latest firefox the alert stays hidden under the child windowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh5BGo.png altenter image description herep  pFor the screen shot here I moved the child window so you could see the alert under the child.  If the window isnt moved, the user wont see the box and will continue trying to click the done button which triggers the same call again, and again, and again etc.  p  pIs there a way I can give the parent window focus when the alert comes up without messing with aboutconfig  I cant alter the parent function that much as the code is very old and it has a tendency to break things if servilely altered I have no idea what else calls said function.p

Negative 2848 pI am learning java swing and came across the concept of anonymous inner class. After studying a bit at this a hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiAnonymousInnerClass relnofollowlinka, I feel that an anonymous inner class must always extend some other class since the method in which it gets passed as a parameter is predefined. At most, if a method accepts Object instances as parameter, only then we can create an anonymous independent inner class. I just seek your opinion whether I am right. It would be helpful if you could provide some example. Thanks in advance. p

Negative 2848 pPlease forgive the awkward title. Im not entirely sure how to phrase itp  pI have an entity, lets call it codeAcode. codeAcode is pulled from a spreadsheet weekly and then stored in a table. The spreadsheet is cumulative, as in data pulled from 6 weeks ago is included in the spreadsheet from 1 week ago.p  pNow, sometimes this data will be the same and wont need changing. Sometimes it will need changing. I want to keep the primary table full of the most up to date data. That is, as entities are updated, the outdated entity is deleted and the newer entity is inserted in its place.p  pWhen an codeAcode entity has changed, I create a codeConflictcode, such that this codeConflictcode has a Guid, a DateTime of the conflict discovery, a comment, and a copy of the old entity so that we can see what has changed and so forth, plus related conflicts. The related conflicts works fine, however Id like to know how I can persist the old entities.p  pI could do a component mapping, but that just explodes the table and I believe that I could do this in a more pretty fashion.p  pMy codeConflictcode is mapped as follows p  precodepublic class ConflictAMapping  ClassMapltConflictltAgtgt      public ConflictAMapping              Idc gt c.Guid         Mapc gt c.DateOfConflict         Mapc gt c.Comment         HasManyc gt c.RelatedConflicts             .KeyColumnConflictKey             .Inverse             .Cascade.All             .TableRelatedConflicts         ReferencesltAgtc gt c.OriginalEntity             .ColumnFKIssueNumber             .Cascade.All       codepre  pAnd my codeAcode mappingp  precodepublic class GSFEntityMapping  ClassMapltGSFEntitygt      public GSFEntityMapping            ... unrelated properties blah blah ...

Negative 2848 pI have a table in my database called university with 3 columns uni id, uni name and student id. Ive added an auto increment value, the uni id. When a student select the university name lets say University A, the ID should be 1 and the student id will be updated with the id of the student. Thats fine. But if another user selects the same university University A, the uni id will automatically change to 2 obviously, its an auto increment value yep. The uni name will stay the same University A and a new student id will be inserted in the table. p  pIs there any way I can keep the same uni id for specific uni names  For examplep  ul liuni id  uni name  student idli li1Uni AS10li li1Uni AS37li ul  pAlso, I have a second table, can I pass the uni id in that table For examplep  ul liuni id  course idli li1 CS90li ul  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2848 pI know that maybe the title sounds a bit weird but I believe that my problem is weird indeed. I have an ASP.NET MVC 4 application this is my first MVC realworld application with Razor viewengine. p  pI have a layout view where Im rendering two partial views like thisp  precode lt Login gt Html.ActionRenderLoginPopup, Login  lt Registration gt Html.ActionRenderRegisterPopup, Login codepre  pEach of those actions from the Login controller just renders a partial viewp  precode    [ChildActionOnly]     public ActionResult RenderLoginPopup              return PartialViewPartialLoginPopupPartial      codepre  pJust for exemplification sake both are built the same way, the login partial view contains an ajax form like thisp  precodeusing Ajax.BeginFormLogin, Login, new AjaxOptions              HttpMethod  POST,         OnSuccess  loginResponseReceived     , new  id  loginForm  codepre  pThe Login action from the Login controller the target of the form is signed with the following attributes worth to mention and notice the HttpPost onep  precode    [HttpPost]     [AllowAnonymous]     [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]     public JsonResult LoginLoginModel model       codepre  pSo far, so good... Everything works perfect  both the login and the register actions are working without any issues.p  pThe issue that I want to speak about showsup when I have a Html.BeginForm in a view that is loaded along with the main layout. For example, if I have a pure and simple form like thisp  precode    using Html.BeginForm             ltinput typehidden namenamegt        ltinput typesubmit valueSendgt      codepre  palong with the controller CaptionExtendedControllerp  precode    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult Indexstring nume              return View      codepre  pSo, in the end, in my final html generated file I will have 3 forms  2 for login and register ajax and one simple form generated from the last view. Please keep in mind that all three forms are independent meaning that they are not one in another. p  pThe issue is that everytime Im pressing the button Send from the last form all controllers that are signed with the [HttpPost] attribute from my view Login, Register from LoginController and Index from CaptionExtendedController gets called.p  pWHY In order to have a temporary fix, Ive removed the [HttpPost] attribute from the Login and Register actions and now its working but I dont think this is correct.p  pPlease, there is someone who can explain me why this is happening and eventually point me to the right direction in fixing this issuep  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 2848 pDisclaimer I have fairly straightforwardbruteforce ways of solving my questions the goal of the question is to learn better approaches and libraries that assist with these calculations.p  pI have a fairly sizeable csv 100k lines with people, location, time data, and money spent, amongst other things.  Say, something likep  precodethomas, park, noon, 0 jim, pool, afternoon, 5 sandy, school, noon, 0 alex, mall, night, 20 codepre  pAs I approach this corpus of data a few things of interest Id like to discover, and the ways Id go about doing them.  Currently I implement things with a blend of R and Python and RPy2.p  ol liMost active people  Most visited places  Most busy time  Easy tally of occurrences that I tally via a for loop.li lipSimilarity  people who visit X also visit Y  given a subset of people who visit a park, what are the other locations they visit  Can be applied to the other dimensions as well.  Currently I implement this by iterating through the subset and tally things up.  Whats betterp  pemslight digression for 34 found libraries but would love to hear better approacheslibrariesempli liVisualization via network graphs to see clustersconcentrations  each person is defined as a vertex and the shared location is defined as a colored edge.  Preprocessing of the data is kinda a pain due to my data format I can also cheat by having edges be both people and locationstime since thats involves less preprocessing.  Currently using weighted graph in R igraph library.li liCluster analysis to see if data falls into certain bins right now Im just using kmeans clustering.li ol  pSo to reiterate, given the nature of my inquiries, what would be good libraries that have prebuilt and optimized functions to answer some of my questions  It just seems that using a bunch of for loops is a really inefficient and inelegant way to gather insight.p

Negative 2848 pI have been given a large list of datetime representations that need to be read into a database.  I am using Python because it rocks.  The strings are in a terrible, terrible format where they are not precise to seconds, no timezone is stated, and the hours do not have a leading 0.  So they look more like thisp  precodeApril 29, 2013, 752 p.m. April 30, 2013, 4 p.m. codepre  pYoull notice that if something happens between 400 and 401 it drops the minutes, too ugh.  Anyway, trying to parse these with time.strptime, but a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarytime.htmltime.strftime relnofollowthe docsa state that hours must be decimal numbers [0112] or [0124].  Since nothing is padded with 0s Im wondering if there is something else I can pass to strptime to accept hours without leading 0 or if I should try splitting, then padding the strings or use some other method of constructing the datetime object.  p  pAlso, it does not look like strptime accepts AMPM as A.M. or P.M., so Ill have to correct that as well. . . p  pNote, I am not able to just handle these strings in a batch. I receive them oneatatime from a foreign application which sometimes uses nicely formatted Unix epoch timestamps, but occasionally uses this format.  Processing them on the fly is the only option.p  pI am using Python 2.7 with some Python 3 features imported.p  precodefrom future import printfunction, unicodeliterals codepre

Negative 2848 pI have worked on this a for a while and googled everything related I can think of. p  pI have a button in my app that toggles rotation. When I turn rotation off, rotate the device, then turn rotation back on, I need a way to match the app orientation back to the device orientation. p  precodeinterface ViewController       BOOL rotationStatus  codepre  pMethod tied to the button pressp  precode   voidtoggleRotation              ifrotationStatus  NO                              rotationStatus  YES                  else                      rotationStatus  NO                  BOOLshouldAutorotate only targeting iOS 6      return rotationStatus  codepre  pThis works great to toggle rotation, but when rotation is turned back on, orientation does not refresh to match device orientation until you rotate the device again. p  pFor example p  ol liDevice and app start in portrait.li liTap button to toggle rotation to off.li liRotate device to Landscape.li liDevice is landscape, app is portrait as expected.li liTap button to toggle rotation to onli ol  pDesired App rotates to landscape to match device.p  pActual App remains in portrait until another rotation notification is received. p  pI think that a way to correct this would be to check the device orientation, and check the app orientation and match them up when rotation is toggled back to on. p  pI added this to the methodp  precodeif UIDeviceOrientationIsLandscape[UIDevice currentDevice].orientation ampamp [[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait                      NSLogmismatched Device and App orientations             do the rotation             [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientation UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight animatedYES]          codepre  pSo the full method looks like this. p  precodevoidtoggleRotation          ifrotationStatus  NO                              rotationStatus  YES                  else                      rotationStatus  NO              if UIDeviceOrientationIsLandscape[UIDevice currentDevice].orientation ampamp [[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait                          NSLogmismatched Device and App orientations               do the rotation               [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientation UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight animatedYES]                      codepre  pThe NSLog prints when I expect it to, but the call to setStatusBarOrientation does not result in rotation. p  pIm an iOS rookie, so I am sure I am doing many things wrong.

Negative 2848 pI have a website that is set up to be used on mobile devices.  The user can draw on a canvas element and then click the submitButton button to save the canvas to a server.  When the user clicks the button, the submitButton button disappears and a submittingButton button appears in its place.  All this is working correctly.  In fact, the entire project is working correctly after I changed the submittingButton button to a codetypebuttoncode instead of codetypesubmitcode.  p  pMy question is, however, when I change the codestyle.displaycode of the submittingButton button, if I set the codestyle.displaycode to codeblockcode, the form is not submitted which is what I want but the button is displayed on a new line.  However, if I set the codestyle.displaycode to codeinlinecode or codeinlineblockcode, the form is submitted, the page refreshed, and the drawing is cleared.  Why does the form submit when the codestyle.displaycode is set to codeinlinecode or codeinlineblockcode but not submit when the codestyle.displaycode is set to codeblockcodep  pHere are the relevant parts of my codep  precodefunction sendImage ifwindow.hasBeenDrawn   document.getElementByIdsignError.style.displaynone   document.getElementByIdsubmitButton.disabledtrue   document.getElementByIdclearButton.disabledtrue   window.wasSenttrue   document.getElementByIdsubmitButton.style.displaynone   document.getElementByIdsubmittingButton.style.display   document.getElementByIdsubmittingButton.style.displayblock    saveImage  codepre  pAnd the HTMLp  precodeltform methodpost action classsigPadgt   ltdiv idreceipt styletextaligncentergt     ltdiv classsig sigWrappergt       ltcanvas stylewidth85 height95 margintop25px height300 classpad idmyCanvas gt       ltinput typehidden nameoutput classoutput gt     ltdivgt     ltbr gt   ltdivgt   ltdiv idclearSubButtonsgt     ltbutton idclearButton onclickredoSig return false gtampnbspltbuttongt     ltbutton idsubmitButton typesubmit onclicksendImagegtampnbspltbuttongt     ltbutton idsubmittingButton styledisplaynonegtampnbspltbuttongt   ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pPS.

Negative 2848 pSo I have an codeltimggtcode tag on my page.p  precodeltimg idtheimage srcimageServletgt codepre  pLets assume that the imageServlet is responding with a few HTTP response headers that indicate that the browser should never cache this image. The reason, in this case, is that the image may contain sensitive employee information and there are laws in certain countries that the browser should not without user consent save the image on the clients hard drive in case the machine is stolen. I believe the response header is codeCacheControl nocachecodep  pAll I really want to do is duplicate this image tag, but I do not want another HTTP request to be made for this image.p  pMy application is a single page, using javascript I dynamically these image tags  but now I would like to display this same image in more than one place. For example the image could be a thumbnail version of a users profile picture. In one place I display the thumbnail as a small list, and then I display the same image in a popup when you click that user.p  pEvery time I create a new codeltimggtcode tag with this src, the browser is making a fresh call to the server to retrieve the image. I dont care if the user presses refresh on the browser and a new HTTP request for that image should load  but within a single page load, shouldnt the Image data be available in memory, so couldnt I reuse thisp  pHow can I get around this This greatly impacts the performance of the page, where images are reused and displayed in multiple places, and they need to reload every time even though user has not navigated to any other page or refresh browser.p  pHere is some code that I wrote just now with an idea where any time the application wants to load an image it would call loadImage which would eventually call the callback with some HTML element that it can freely use. The idea would be this central function would create the Image but it would make sure that for any unique codesrccode only one single HTTP request would be made  regardless if the HTTP response headers contain codeCacheControl nocachecode or not.p  precodefunction   var HANDLERS           I want to keep around a cached Image then the callback will be called with a     duplicate somehow  whatever comes back from here can be inserted somewhere, but     hopefully no additional HTTP requests needs to be made     param Image img     return Image A copy of the incoming img       function duplicateImageimg       Does not work Doh, is this even possible to achieve     return img.cloneNodetrue            Users can call this to load the image. The callback is called when the image is ready.     In case the image fails the callback will be given an object that contains a success flag.          Example     loadImageimageServletxxxx, functionresult        if result.success  body.appendresult.image        else  console.logThe image failed to load                param string src The src for the image     param functionsuccessboolean, imageImage callback Give a callback to be called when ready       window.loadImage  functionsrc, callback      if HANDLERS[src]        var queue  []         This loadImage can be called more than once with the same src        before the image has successfully loaded. We will queue up any        callbacks and call them later, then replace this with function        that will directly invoke the callback later.       HANDLERS[src]  functioncallback          queue.pushcallback                Create the image here, but do it only once       var el  new Image         When the image loads, we will keep it around in the el        variable, but the callback will be called with a copy       el.onload  function          el.onload  el.onerror  null         var call  HANDLERS[src]  functioncallback            callback             success true,             image duplicateImageel  This is where the image is duplicated                             for var i0 iltqueue.length i            callqueue[i]                         This is just in case the image fails to load. Call any        queued callbacks with the success false.       el.onerror  function          el.onload  el.onerror  null         var call  HANDLERS[src]  functioncallback            callbacksuccess false                  for var i0 iltqueue.length i            callqueue[i]                       el.src  src          HANDLERS[src]callback     codepre

That didnt work well. Now Im stuck, because when I try to add my view to the layout assined to the activity to display the grid, I get errors. When I set one of those rectangles directly with codesetContentViewrectanglecode it gets displayed somewhere in the middle of the screen.p  pSo my questions arep  ul lipIs it the right way to create these rectangles by inheriting from View keep in mind that I have to modify the way the are drawn when the user does click on a rectangle and I want to open a menu later when a rectangle gets clickedpli lipWhats the best way to display these rectangles Which kind of layout should I use when I wanted display them in a gridlike fashion The user should later also be able to delete some rectangles. So it must be possible to have emgapsem in the grid.pli lipAs it didnt work to add the rectangles to a layout with this code, how should I do it I used a LinearLayoutp  precodeViewGroup layout  ViewGroup findViewByIdR.id.confnewsolarplantlayout SolarPanelView spView  new SolarPanelViewthis spView.setLayoutParamsnew LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT layout.addViewspView codepreli ul  pThe error I receive is the followingp  precode    1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203 FATAL EXCEPTION main     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to start activity ComponentInfocom.smartexergy.appcom.smartexergy.app.ConfNewSolarPlantActivity java.lang.NullPointerException     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2194     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2229     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.ActivityThread.access600ActivityThread.java139     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1261     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java154     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4944     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java784     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java551     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at com.smartexergy.app.ConfNewSolarPlantActivity.onCreateConfNewSolarPlantActivity.java34     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.Activity.performCreateActivity.java4531     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreateInstrumentation.java1071     1106 114149.862 EAndroidRuntime2203     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2150 codepre  pThanksp  pEDIT Got the error fixed, I forgot to set the layout as the contentView.

Negative 2848 pstrongHow do you completely escape the REPLACEMENT part of a perl subsitution with the codescode operatorstrong codeQcode and codeEcode do emnotem work as, shown belowp  pFor context, this comes up when using perl to do big recursive search and replace operations driven from a bash script.

The shell isnt mangling anything and we are echoing what we expect.p  precodeecho Email address here  perl p e shereEMAIL  echo Email address here  perl p e shereuserexample.org Email address user.org codepre  pOkay, that time the replacement wasnt quoted, so the codeexamplecode part of the string got expanded to nothing and effectively disappeared.

Negative 2848 pI develop using Eclipse IDE on a Mac running OSX 10.7.5. This program constructs an array of JPanels, when the user clicks a panel all the other panels on the same row or column change color, blue for left mouse button, red for right button. When I run from the IDE everything works fine, at least Ive never seen it fail. But when I create a .jar file and run by double clicking that, most of the time it works fine but every once in a while it doesnt change the color of some of the other panels. p  pTo test I pick one square and alternately right click and left click it. As I said most of the time it works and all the other panels in the same row or the same column change color. But if I right click a square and some of the panels stay blue thats the failure. If I right click the same square again it doesnt change the display the failed panels stay blue. Its like the manager thinks everything is the right color and doesnt bother to update the display. p  pIf I resize the panel or click any other square with either button, all panels flip to the correct color. This code doesnt have an explicit call to repaint but Ive tried that and it doesnt fix the problem. Ive tried reading about repaint manager, but havent found a way to get the display to reliably update. As I said, Ive never seen this happen when running the IDE and most of the time it works as an application too. Just now it took about 50 clicks to get a failure. p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event. import javax.swing.  public class GUITest extends JPanel   final static int NROWS  81 final static int TOTALSQ  NROWS  NROWS Square [] square  new Square [TOTALSQ]  public GUITest       setLayout new GridLayoutNROWS,NROWS     for int i0 iltTOTALSQ i          square [i]  new Squarei         add square [i]         public void squareClicked int id, int button       determine which row and column     int row  id  NROWS     int col  id  NROWS      change background color of all squares on same row or column     for int i  0 iltTOTALSQ i          if row  i  NROWS  col  i  NROWS             if button  MouseEvent.BUTTON3                 square[i].setBackgroundColor.RED             else                 square[i].setBackgroundColor.BLUE       squareClicked   class Square extends JPanel implements MouseListener      int id  0      which square this is      public Square int id          this.id  id         setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black         addMouseListenerthis       Square constructor      public void mouseClicked MouseEvent e            public void mouseEntered MouseEvent e            public void mouseExited MouseEvent e            public void mousePressed MouseEvent e            public void mouseReleased MouseEvent e          squareClicked id, e.getButton        Square  public static void main String [] args      JFrame frame  new JFrameGUI Test     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE      GUITest app  new GUITest     frame.setSize800,600     frame.setLocationRelativeTonull     frame.getContentPane.addapp, BorderLayout.CENTER     frame.setVisibletrue   codepre  pI have a second question that might be related. IDE displays much faster than the application does. The IDE updates in a flash. The application updates each panel individually, its noticeably slower.

Negative 2848 pI am having the hardest time figuring this out.  I am using MVC 4 and Code First Entity Framework.  I have three classes.  They are Users, Roles, and Project.  A user can have many projects and for a particular project, a user can have a particular role.  I am using a junction table to combine the three tables.  Here is an example of the Junction Tablep  precodepublic class UserRolesinProject       [Key, ColumnOrder  0]      public int UserId  get set      [Key, ColumnOrder  1]      public int RoleId   get set      [Key, ColumnOrder  2]      public int ProjectId   get set   codepre  pHere are samples of each of the classesp  precodepublic class DBUser      [Key]     public int UserId  get set     public string UserName  get set     public virtual ICollectionlt UserRolesinProject gt Roles  get set    public class DBRole      [Key]     public int RoleId  get set     public string RoleName  get set     public virtual ICollectionlt UserRolesinProject gt Projects  get set    public class Project       [Key]      public int ProjectId  get set      public string ProjectName  get set      public virtual ICollectionlt UserRolesinProject gt Users  get set   codepre  pLastly a sample of the context classp  precode    Public DBSetltDBUsergtUsers get set     Public DBSetltDBRolesgtRoles get set     Public DBSetltProjectgtProjects get set     Public DBSetltUserRolesInProjectgtUserRolesProjects get set codepre  pSo at the moment this builds and the tables are created when I use the package manager console to update the database.  What I wanted to achieve was if I do a LINQ statement from the User I would like to retrieve all the projects that the User is assigned to and the respective role.  Right now, Im just getting the ids of each field, which is from the junction table and the mapping that I did in each individual class to the junction table.  I thought the result would be they all would be joined.  What am I doing wrong  I searched and viewed different examples, but they were all for two PK columns not three.  Are my tables wrong  Did I set them up in an inefficient way  Thanks in advance for the help.p
Negative 2848 pI am looking to put a bit of text centered over a clickable image.  There is a lot of support for the issue of putting text over an image using HTML and CSS, but I can make none of the advice work for my issue.  I think this is because the 4 images that I want to do this to do not have a fixed location, but instead have a size relative to the window size. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11051794verticallyandhorizontallyaligningtextoveranimageofvariablesizeThis was particularly helpful, but for the J Query advice, the text didnt show up when I made the images clickable to links.ap  pI realize that because the images change size relative to the screen dimensions, I may have to use JQuery to keep the text within the images.

Negative 2848 pMy understanding is that codeconstexprcode globals of class type are all but unusable becausep  ul lipSuch an object must be defined in every TU, because codeconstexprcode does not permit forward declaration of an object.pli lipDefault linkage as codestaticcode would cause naming the object ODRuse or not in an inline function to violate the ODR, because the respective codeinlinecode definitions would have different meaning.pli lipDeclaration as codeextern constexprcode with one definition per TU would violate the ODR rule if the object is ODRused, which occurs when a reference to it is taken.p  ul liA reference is taken for an implicit codethiscode parameter, even if its unused by a member function.li liObviously happens if you try to pass the object by reference.li liAlso happens if you try to pass the object by value, which implicitly uses a copy or move constructor, which by definition passes by reference.li liGCC and Clang both complain of ODR violations multiple definitions if an object is declared codeextern constexprcode even if not ODRused.li ulli ul  pIs this all correct Is there any way to have a codeconstexprcode global of class type without wrapping it in an codeinlinecode functionp

This is confirmed by Firefox sending additional requests and Chrome sending additional requests, either through means of a conditional request or a regular one this depends on the settings of the headers that govern browser caching. This behaviour is a bit casual though and sometimes, no new requests are sent if you use the images early on but the longer your wait, the more probable it seems that the browser reloads the images via new requests another hint that it has to do with garbage collecting. Therefore, it seems to me that the first suggestion shouldnt be recommended. With the second suggestion I dont see a single reload and I guess thats because the array of image objects is actually kept in scope and therefore not garbage collected. Can anyone confirm this and comment on why, still, the first alternative is so often given as a suggestion Have I missed somethingp

For debugging purposes I colored the model with the weight values and the bone IDs value and they contain a color and thus valid values. However, when I transform my vertex via the bone transformation and color the model with the result, the entire model is colored black, meaning the transformation matrices are all code0.0code.

Negative 2848 pWhen I test my ASP.Net app locally, I use a DNS tool called DNSSpeeder which takes over the DNS process for my machine. In effect, I can setup www.mysite.com locally and enter an IP address like 192.168.178.200 and in my browser just enter www.mysite.com and it launches from my local IIS web server. When Im ready for production, I just disable DNSSpeeder so that an Internets DNS is used to lookup my site.p  pThe problem I am facing is when I use Google OAuth to exchange my code for a token. It returns with an error of redirecturimismatch. It isnt clear to me what is actually going out on the wire to Googles server and what URI Google is seeing. The URI redirect does match what is in the API console, although that doesnt say anything about what is actually sent to Googles server after it leaves DNSSpeeder. I tried Wireshark but it shows nothing. Probably encrypted with https. Instead of using codehttplocalhost8080code, I tried codehttplocalhost80code as well as codehttp192.168.178.200code for the Javascript origins but that didnt help.p  pIs it possible to use an IP address other than localhost when testing locally to get a successful tokenp

Negative 2848 pI have a following issue with laying out text on Android. Im basically trying to have two lines of text with minimal spacing and each should be styled differently. Ive had quite good working solution with two singlelined TextViews one placed below the other, but Ive been still getting a little bit cropped text on certain devices..p  pSo I decided to switch to just one TextView an use Spannables instead which should be generally a better solution in all circumstances.p  pThat means I needed to remove the single line property from my TextView  in order to be able to wrap the line before starting the second Spannable..But there is an issue when is the text displayed at the first line actually longer than it..TextView wraps Automaticaly which is an unwanted behavior. Below you can see several screenshots, which should you better tell what Im trying to achieve and where Im now.p  pThe first image shows new layout with spannables and you can see there the wrapped line as well. The second image is the initial version of the layout woth two textviews layed out verically in a LinearLayout.p  pThere is also a problem its actually an appwidget, that means I do not have an access to that textview instance directly. I have been thinking about ditching textviews at all and instead use just ImageView and render all manually on canvas..That seems like an overkill to me, so Im looking for a better solution.

Negative 2848 pWe are actually writing an app for a medical device, which is not supporting Bluetooth Health, so we need a normal bluetooth connection to the device. The device sends a echorequest to our device, which we have to answer with the matching echo, so that we can connect to the HealthDevice. p  pActually we got the problem, that we cant send the message after connecting to the device, because thats just to late. We need the outputStream of the HealthDevice, so that we can determine the right moment to answer with our string.p  pOur bluetooth Code is based on the Android BluetoothChat example, they are opening the inand output streams right after connecting, but we need to open them before connecting.p  pI hope that youve got a solution how to get all bluetooth messages, without an established connection.p

Negative 2848 pI just noticed that my application can not remove a like on a media object.  My code for liking  unliking is identical except I add the parameter methodDELETE to the unlike case both use POST.  The documentation states that this is supported, and its pretty common for RESTful API given the lack of support in most browsers for DELETE.  Ive tried in from the Apigee console too, and the same problem seems to exist, however DELETE does seen to work.  Id attach screenshot from the Apigee console, but apparently I need more points or something.p

I suppose I could use logic like get rid of the  sign, check if theres a decimal point, if so, check how many characters there are after it padding to two and truncating after that then remove the period, if there wasnt one append two zeros and hope for the best but using string operations for this seems ridiculous.p  pSurely taking a monetary value from a form and storing it as cents in a database is a common use case. Surely there is a reasonable way of doing this.p  pRight .....right ltp

Negative 2848 pI have created a calculated column that pulls the text from another site column so I can display just the text. To achieve this I have created a SharePoint 2010 workflow which sets column B with colum A value. I then have a calculated column that will take the text from column B and strip the unnecessary characters and leave just what I want.p  pI have a workflow which finally takes the two calculated columns and replaces the value inside the Title column for the current item. I have the workflow kick off whenever a new item is created, changed etc. When I create an item it will change the title but the title displays Error256  Error256. If I then run the workflow on the item again the correct values are inserted. So I thought the workflow wasnt waiting until the calculated columns were calculated before setting the Title so I modified my workflow as below but I still have this issue.p  pLaptops is passed onto LaptopString which then LaptopTextOnly is the calculated column that uses LaptopString to get the intended value I am looking for.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comae0ij.png altenter image description herep

Negative 2848 pWould someone please get me started with Automator andor AppleScript.  Ive gotten more than a little frustrated with it.  Id like to take a very large folder of files thousands, in a predetermined order perhaps by name or by date and move them into subfolders, each of which is no more than a specified size probably 4.7GB.  I dont want ISOs or DMGs or anything just my files nicely split into disk size chunks.  No reshuffling of the order either.  If a disk only fits a single 10MB file because the next one would blow the limit then so be it.  No file will be bigger than the limit either in case your wondering  they will be up to about 50MB tops.p  pSo far Ive got a Folder Action with Get Selected Finder Items followed by this AppleScriptp  precodeon run input, parameters     return first item of input end run codepre  pThat gets me the first item.

Im sure this problem has been solved already, so please just link me if you can.  Thanks.p

Negative 2848 pIn JavaScript, I have an object.  Changes to that object are being tracked Im using AngularJS.p  pIn my Service in AngularJS, I am getting an updated version of that object.  I dont know what has changed about it, I dont know the model of this object, I just know thatp  p1 These two objects have the same model Although arrays within the model may have increased or decreased in sizep  p2 If I change the reference of my old object to the new one, AngularJS will understandably not be able to update the front end to reflect the new object, because all of the watches on the old object just broke.p  pSo, I thought Well, I will just copy all of the values from the updated object over to the new one   This works remarkably well.  however, I am having trouble getting my formula just right, So I thought I would ask for a bit of help.  note that these are complex objects of an unknown, albeit identical, modelp  precode var makeEqual  functionoriginalObject, updatedObject     for var key in originalObject          if typeof originalObject[key]  object             ampamp originalObject.hasOwnPropertykey              makeEqualoriginalObject[key], updatedObject[key]                  else             originalObject[key]  updatedObject[key]                       codepre  pHowever, so far I have the following problem.  If codeupdateObjectcode is an array, new elements will not be added. deleted elements wont be removed, either I think, not sure about that.  Note that the array could be an array of child objects.p  pTo be honest, I feel like there are toher problems that this might have other than what I have detected myself, so I ask  How can I create this deep copy to an existing object function work perfectly p

Negative 2848 pIm building an Android app in which I need to have a very accurate location at a very high frequency.

So if I get a location with a very low accuracy, I will still have to walk my smallest displacement distance to get a new one, hopefully more accuracte.p  pI wonder if there is a way to avoid such data I cant use location that are not accurate enough or if I have to skip the setSmallestDisplacement part bad for battery consumption.p  pSome code for your pleasurep  precodemLocationRequest  LocationRequest.create mLocationRequest.setInterval100 We get a new location every 100ms or so mLocationRequest.setSmallestDisplacement5  but only if we traveled 5m mLocationRequest.setPriorityLocationRequest.PRIORITYHIGHACCURACY codepre  pThanks.p

Negative 2848 pI used Google Map engine to create a route on the map with marker and linestring across the markerslink a hrefhttpsmapsengine.google.commapeditmidz0DS05yFIOY.kk3gqtVGUw90 relnofollowhttpsmapsengine.google.commapeditmidz0DS05yFIOY.kk3gqtVGUw90a . I then exported the data in a kml file. All i want to do now is create a dynamic route using the below information such as LatLong coordinates when someone clicks a button on my website. I am building a mobile app using HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript. My initial idea was to save the coordinates information in a database using KML parser to parse the KML file. Once i have the coordinate saved i can call them from my javascript code  Not sure it that is a solution to my problem    p  precodeltnamegtUFV To Peardonville and South Fraser   ltnamegt         ltPlacemarkgt             ltstyleUrlgticonseq00ltstyleUrlgt             ltnamegtStop 1 University of the Fraser Valleyltnamegt             ltPointgt                 ltcoordinatesgt122.28257417678833,49.02859706469696,0.0ltcoordinatesgt             ltPointgt         ltPlacemarkgt         ltPlacemarkgt             ltstyleUrlgticonseq01ltstyleUrlgt             ltnamegtStop 2  Marshall and McCallumltnamegt             ltPointgt                 ltcoordinatesgt122.29326009750366,49.03969659484145,0.0ltcoordinatesgt             ltPointgt         ltPlacemarkgt  ltPlacemarkgt             ltstyleUrlgtlineFF82777ltstyleUrlgt             ltnamegtLine 8ltnamegt             ltLineStringgt                 lttessellategt0lttessellategt                 ltcoordinatesgt122.28205919265747,49.02870961988958,0.0 122.281973361969,49.03145307396853,0.0 122.29304552078247,49.031270181736296,0.0 122.29298114776611,49.033211618811904,0.0 122.29280948638916,49.03466061304994,0.0 122.29257345199585,49.035012304315345,0.0 122.29332447052002,49.0358563532078,0.0 122.29334592819214,49.03985132363843,0.0 122.2934103012085,49.04564627375429,0.0 122.29032039642334,49.0456181445595,0.0 122.29032039642334,49.0474605732066,0.0 122.2902774810791,49.049049788878406,0.0 122.29180097579956,49.04906385250716,0.0 122.29519128799438,49.04933106069776,0.0 122.30310916900635,49.05028737298155,0.0 122.30478286743164,49.050498321744364,0.0 122.30437517166138,49.05023111982696,0.0 122.30448246002197,49.04684174982452,0.0 122.30677843093872,49.04696832796101,0.0 122.30982542037964,49.049387314870685,0.0 122.30997562408447,49.05084990102674,0.0ltcoordinatesgt             ltLineStringgt         ltPlacemarkgt codepre

Negative 2848 pI have a requirement where I need to read from a set of Blocking queues. The blocking queues are created by the Library I am using. My code has to read from the queues. I dont want to create a reader thread for each of these blocking queues. Rather I want to poll them for availability of data using a single thread or probably using 23 threads at max. As some of the blocking queues might not have data for long time, while some of them may get bursts of data. Polling the queues with small timeout will work, but that is not efficient at all as it still needs to keep looping over all the queues even when some of them are without data for long time. Basically, I am looking for a selectepollused on sockets kind of mechanism on blocking queues. Any clue is really appreciated.p  pDoing that in Go is real easy though.

And I know that angularjs provides custom additional field validators for mixmax length etc directives, so I dont to test those either.p  pBut I still cant help thinking that I need to test my form as a unit, in particular whether its valid or not.br For example, the domain business rules might say that the form can only be submitted if the name, phone number and email fields are all filled out, and that the email address field contains a valid formatted email address.br In this case I would want to write a series of unit tests where I populate the form objects properties with various combinations of data, and assert the validity of the form.p  pMaybe the problem is that Im coming from a java background, and the above pattern re unit testing is certainly what Im used to.p
Negative 2848 pIve been using Magmi with great success, creating and updating our magento products on a daily basis.p  pOur production retail site generally uses the defaultadmin values for store.  When I make new categories and populate them I generally use the categoryreset0 column to preserve the handmade sort order or position values for all of the original categories.p  pIve been working on a wholesale site set up with a seperate filesystem for all 3 levels of the Magento hierarchy.  I did an import with magmi setting the store column to the wholesale site, with 2 additional collumns  sku and categoryids without categoryreset using a subset of data exported from the admin store view filtered the manufacturer column for only one manufacturer to try to populate the wholesale site categories same root catalog with certain categories disabled or not visible with the same category products.p  pFor some reason, Im not sure why, ouch, I realize now there was a typo in the header name for store it did not update the right store  it defaulted back to admin and lost  the sort order for many categories, about 3k products imported ok.p  pI have 2 nonproduction sandbox sites with duplicate category data.  Ive been manually copying the category product listings with the desired position values into a new csv so I will have sku,categoryid singular,positionvalue p  pMany products are members of more than one category.  My question is...p  pIn order to regain the position values or sort order, what syntax should I use under categoryids  The products are already in the category so I would use a categoryreset0 column, rightp  pfor an example recordp  precodesku           categoryids 45000         39,262,353  codepre  pmy next import might look likep  precodesku           categoryids      categoryreset abc           3910            0 def           3920            0 45000         3930            0 ghi           26210           0 45000         26220           0 jkl           26230           0 45000         35310           0 mno           35320           0 codepre  pdoes this seem workable  Im feeling very gunshy after having borked my production site with a typo and need some validation before I take steps to confuse myself further.p  pThanks in advance for any insight.p
Negative 2848 pIm trying to create a windows form app that owns the top area of a screen. Think of it as just a rectangular form width  screen size and height  20px or so. The app would always be on top and would be borderless i.e. FormBorderStylenone. The questionable part, for example, if a user maximizes a window like chrome or some other application, it should treat the bottom of this windows form app as the top of the screen. This way since the form app is always on top, it doesnt cover up any of the maximized applications window.p  pAny clues on how to do this.. can it be done with windows forms The only questionable part is how to own a portion of the screen.p  pLet me know if clarification is needed.

Negative 2848 pAt the beginning of each request, I set the Thread.CurrentPrincipal in my AuthorizationFilter to the authenticated user with custom claims. When I try to log errors thrown in a controller action in my ExceptionFilter, the principal accessed from within the ExceptionFilter isnt the same as the one I set in my AuthorizationFilter. In fact, the principal I get in the ExceptionFilter is the principal that existed on the thread before I changed it in my AuthorizationFilter.

Negative 2848 pIm fairly inexperienced with python, so I find myself at a loss as to how to approach this bug. Ive inherited a python app that mainly just copies files and folders from one place to another. All the files and folders are on the local machine and the user has full admin rights, so there are no networking or security issues here.p  pWhat Ive found is that a number of files fail to get copied from one directory to another unless I slow down the code somehow. If I just run the program it fails, but if I step through with a debugger or add codeprintcode statements to the copy loop, it succeeds. The difference there seems to be either the timing of the loop or moving things around in memory.p  pIve seen this sort of bug in compiled languages before, and it usually indicates either a race condition or memory corruption. However, there is only one thread and no interaction with other processes, so a race condition seems impossible. Memory corruption remains a possibility, but Im not sure how to investigate that possibility with python.p  pHere is the loop in question. As you can see, its rather simplep  precodedef concatdirsdir, subdir     return dir    subdir  for name in fullnames     installname  concatdirsinstallpath, name     dirname  os.path.dirnameinstallname     if not os.path.existsdirname          os.makedirsdirname     shutil.copyfileconcatdirsjavapath, name, installname codepre  pThat loop usually fails to copy the files unless I either step through it with a debugger or add this statement after the codeshutil.copyfilecode line.p  precode    print copied , concatdirsjavapath, name,  to , installname codepre  pIf I add that statement or step through in debug, the loop works perfectly and consistently. Im tempted to say good enough with the codeprintcode statement but I know thats just masking an underlying problem.p  pIm not asking you to debug my code because I know you cant Im asking for a debug strategy. How do I approach finding this bugp

Negative 2848 pIm new to AndroidJava programming and I came across an issue where I have to use PHP session to keep the user logged in persistant login, this has a set of methods form using httpclient cookie or using SharedPreferences and it made think of this solution instead of using session, p  p1 Login the user with backend with HTTPs, this will happen only the first time the user login, the app Im working on requires one time login and no logout mechanism. the user name and password will be sent by SMS after installing the app.p  p2 If user exist save the save the userpasscould be token here in SharedPreferencesp  p3 Whenever the user needs something from the backend send the userpass over HTTPs and the backend will reply if the userpasscould be token here is correct.p  pMy question is, do you think the overhead of checking the userpass or token with every request is a bad idea p  pThe reason Im asking this is that PHP session ID use the same method by checking the file that has the session variables which looks like the same overhead caused by checking the userpass or token against DB.p
Negative 2848 pI have a piece of code that counts the lines of code within a wordpress site.

Negative 2848 pIm struggling to basically understand how the assignment operator works, or perhaps I havent defined the right one, or Ive come upon some C gotcha not sure.p  pI have a class like thisp  precodeclass A   public     A    Aconst A amprhs     some other ctors    and functions here     Aamp operatorA rhs    A  createhalf     double mdata   codepre  pHere is the body of createhalf it appears to be relevant to the situationp  precodeA Acreatehalf    construct a new A   A mya    do stuff to mya here,   and then return the new A   return mya   codepre  pHere is the copy constructor, at least a shortened version of it.  This is the code that is skipped due to standard  at least if this is whats truly going on.p  precodeAAconst Aamp rhs  mdatanew double[1]      mdata  rhs.mdata     or something similar, essentially     a deep copy  codepre  pThen in the code I try to write something like thisp  precodeA ainstance  do stuff to ainstance  this doesnt call any  operator or  copy ctor I try to define, why A binstance  A.createhalf   but this works fine the  operator I have defd is called A binstance binstance  A.createhalf codepre  pThe line that doesnt work as I want it to seems to do a default copy ie, binstance.mdata is set to ainstance.mdata even though neither my copy ctor now my assignment operator contain this operation.p  pFor the problematic line, Im not able to step into the assignment operator thats why I think I have the wrong signature, or something similar.  p  pAny ideasp  pEDIT Sorry for misleading you guys  no class B exists.p  pEDIT AGAIN Ive accepted an answer, and Ive added some detail to the snippets above to try to elucidate what is really going on.p  pSince the instance of A created by createhalf isnt bound to a reference, the standard allows elision of the copy constructor, which, critically, allocates new memory for binstance, and does the deep copy.p  pThat seems pretty bold, to me  I dont think Ill see an answer, since this edit is sometime after the initial posting, but what would be a better design pattern herep

Negative 2848 pIm working on some software that exchanges XML documents with a server. The server signs the XML using XMLDSIG and the client should verify the signature before trusting the XML.

I want the distribution of the client software to be as simple as possible and I dont want the client to have to deal with certificates. The pair of documents referenced above conveniently skirt around the subject of distributing the public key, simply stating that the user needs to have the same key. I dont particularly want the end user to even be aware that they have a public key, so asking them to mess around with certificates is out of the question. Since the public key is public, what I would like to do is somehow embed it within the client software.

You can see the plugin is dynamically setting codewidthcode. But it is not attached to the left panel. At the time the plugin is initialized, the left pane hasnt been added to the DOM yet.p

Negative 2848 pCould anyone please explain me which are the technical rules involved in applying special fonts such as Symbol or Webdings over text in WordprocessingML My understanding is that those are special fonts, applying them over a run of text not only creates a specific rFonts tag but also changes the Unicode value of the texts characters how exactly and even splits the text into multiple runs, each one containing a single transformed character.p  pIt seems however that this rule is not applied consistently. A good example is text in complex script or East Asian languages, e.g.p  precodeltwrgt     ltwrPrgt             ltwrFonts wasciiSymbol whAnsiSymbol whintcsgt             ltwrtlgt             ltwlang wbidiheILgt     ltwrPrgt     ltwtgt    ltwtgt ltwrgt codepre  pIn this case, the Hebrew text      is not transformed in any way, not even the whitespaces inside it. I suspect therefore that theres some more complex rule of applying this type of fonts, depending probably on the Unicode value of the underlying characters, but i cant find it documented anywhere. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could explain it to me in detail.p  pAnd one more exceptional situation, that i do not quite understand, seems to involve the track changes feature in Word wrPrChangep  precodeltwrPrgt     ltwrFonts wasciiSymbol whAnsiSymbolgt     ltwrPrChange wid1 wauthorx wdate20140728T103300Zgt             ltwrPrgt     ltwrPrChangegt ltwrPrgt ltwtgtwith symbolsltwtgt codepre  pYou can notice again that the text is not affected in this case, even if the characters belong to the ASCII range, which is normally affected by these symbol fonts.p

Negative 2848 pIve run into an interesting problem that appears to be the result of visual studio 2013 not actually deleting fstreams when the delete operator is called for them. The code below is a simple program that, when compiled in visual studio 2013 with default debug mode, performs exactly as expected. When the code is compiled in release mode with generate debug info turned on so that some debugging can be done the delete operator behavior appears dependent on the contents of the delete operator. If the delete operator contains a cout, it is called immediately for portions of the memory allocated, if it doesnt contain a cout it isnt called at all until it runs the exit function in crtexe.c, and by the time its called the foo mutex is in some invalid state, resulting in Access violation reading location 0xFEEEFEF6.p  precodeinclude ltcstdlibgt  include ltfstreamgt include ltmutexgt include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  mutex foo  void operator newunsigned int size      lockguardltmutexgt memoryLockfoo     void alloc  mallocsize     cout ltlt Allocating  ltlt size ltlt  bytes for  ltlt alloc ltlt endl     return alloc   void operator new[]unsigned int size      lockguardltmutexgt memoryLockfoo     void alloc  mallocsize     cout ltlt Allocating  ltlt size ltlt  bytes for  ltlt alloc ltlt endl     return alloc   void operator deletevoid ptr      lockguardltmutexgt memoryLockfoo     cout ltlt Deallocating  ltlt ptr ltlt endl     freeptr   void operator delete[]void ptr      lockguardltmutexgt memoryLockfoo     cout ltlt Deallocating  ltlt ptr ltlt endl     freeptr   int main      cout ltlt Address of Mutex  ltlt ampfoo ltlt endl     cout ltlt Creating fstream...  ltlt endl     fstream blarg  new fstreamblarg.txt, iosout     cout ltlt Deleteing fstream... ltlt endl     delete blarg     cout ltlt fstream deleted... ltlt endl      cout ltlt Exiting main... ltlt endl     return 0  codepre  pThis program outputsp  precodeAddress of Mutex 00DD6658 Creating fstream...

Exiting main... codepre  pand then crashes with the access violation.p  pIf you set a breakpoint inside of the delete operator, youll see the calls to it happen exactly as the output indicates. If you leave those breakpoints in, but comment out the cout line, then the debugged never hits the delete operator until it hits the exit function in crtexe.c.p  pThe big issue is that for some reason, fstream or at least not all of its resources is being deleted after it looks like other global resources have been destroyed, which means that fstreams dynamically allocated memory objects are calling the custom delete operator after resources that it uses are invalid.p  pI should be able to produce a workaround for my application, thats really not my concern at this point, Im simply trying to understand the why behind whats going on. Why would fstreams destructor andor the freeing of its memory be delayed What, if anything, can be done to prevent this kind of behavior Can I expect other classes to potentially produce this kind of behaviorp

Negative 2848 pOdd situation happening with googlebot and recording visitors to our website. Tldr setting session.gcmaxlifetime causes our PHP session management routine to no longer record googlebot visits.p  hr  pEvery page on our website calls a PHP routine for session management. The routine starts a PHP session and sets cookies if not already present. Then, for every visit session already set or not it gets the visitor information and stores it in a mySql database. It stores standard info ip, query string, user agent, language from SERVER.p  pIt worked fine.p  pThen we changed the PHP session.gcmaxlifetime. We set it at 65,000 seconds, just under the max value of 65,535 the maximum unless you want to do self session handler, as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22803632isitpossibletosetsessiongcmaxlifetime65535secondsIs it possible to set session.gcmaxlifetime gt 65535 secondsa. The code we usedp  precodeiniset session.gcmaxlifetime, 65000 sessionstart codepre  pEverything was fine except googlebot.p  pGooglebot visits were no longer recorded into the database by this PHP routine. Server logs show that googlebot still visits many times each day. We also check Google itself and it definitely has updated info from our site as well as cached versions. But the googlebot visits just arent recorded into our mySql database any longer. No errors given off that we could find, but they just dont run through.p  pVisits from every other user are recorded into the database. Real user, bot, spammy, whatever, no problem. Its only googlebot that isnt recorded. We dont need the googlebot visits for analysis and tracking, but we worry that whatever is happening could make us miss real users.p  pWe deleted the session.gcmaxlifetime setting, i.e. we left it at the default value of 1440 seconds. Googlebot started getting recorded again.p  pIt seems so odd, so we tested a few more times, setting session.gcmaxlifetime at 65,000, leaving it at default, back and forth, and we found that googlebot being recorded is definitely tied to that. We have no idea if its directly caused by changing session.gcmaxlifetime or an indirect effect on something else, but it seems that at the least googlebot being recorded or not on our site is correlated to whether or not we set session.gcmaxlifetime. p  pAny ideas what is happeningp

Negative 2848 pSince Android 4.4 KitKat its possible to use function getExternalFilesDirs. I implemented this function and it works fine. The Google reference says the following about this functionp  pemReturns absolute paths to applicationspecific directories on all external storage devices where the application can place persistent files it owns. These files are internal to the application, and not typically visible to the user as media.em p  pThe first returned result is the primary storage which you also get when you call function getExternalFilesDir.p  pIn my opinion, you can get only one additional storage device, namely when the user inserted a micro sdcard in his device. Thats why I name the first returned result Internal storage, the second I name SDcard. Are there cases where there are more than 2 returned results possible with getExternalFilesDirsp

Negative 2848 pIm trying to make a basic Skype bot using codeSkype4Pycode and have encountered a rather serious error. I am working on a 64 bit windows 7 with the 32bit Python 2.7.8. installed, along with the latest version of Skype4Py.p  pMy main demand is that the bot has an overview of code5code different Skype chats four individual chats with four users and one common chat in which all four users participate. To that end, I have written two different functions handling individual responses and the group chatp  precodeclass SkypeBotobject     def initself         self.skype  Skype4Py.SkypeEventsself         self.skype.Attach         self.activechat  findconferencechat      def MessageStatusself, msg, status         if status  Skype4Py.cmsReceived             if msg.Chat.Name  self.activechat.Name                 msg.Chat.SendMessagerespondtogroupmsg             else                 msg.Chat.SendMessagerespondtoindividualmsg bot  SkypeBot codepre  pThe above code theres much more to it, but the core of it is written down is supposed to answer each message that any user sends either privately or in the group chat.p  pHowever, theres a problem. Usually, this code works just fine. The bot responds to each individual user as well as the group chat. Then, every once in a while once every 10 chats, the bot stops responding to individual messages. The function codeMessageStatuscode simply does not fire, which made me think that there may be some other event I need to catch. So I added one general event catcher to the botp  precode    def Notifyself, notification         print NOTIFICATION         print notification         print  codepre  pThe only purpose of this code was to see if I am missing any event. So I waited for a bit, and when the bot did not respond, I checked the printout of the function.p  ul liUsually, the bot recieves several notifications when a message arrives theres the chatmessage recieved notification, the chat activity timestamp notification and some others. The chatmessage recieved notification is the one that eventually triggers the codeMessageStatuscode event.li liIn the case when the bot did not respond, only one notification came through. It was the notification codeCHAT  ACTIVITYTIMESTAMP code. There was no notification that a chatmessage was recieved, so no message to respond do.li ul  pWhen I manually clicked on my Skype client and focused my window on the message recieved, the codeMessageStatuscode evend finally fired and the bot responded, but that was way too late.p  hr  pMy question has several partsp  ul liIs my general code correct Should, if codeSkype4Pycode worked flawlessly, my code work OKli liDid anyone else encounter this error where a certain event did not fireli liIf you encountered a similar error, have you solved it If not, did you at least discover how to consistently reproduce this problem I cant even debug it because it appears suddenly and out of nowhere...li ul

It launches the Take PhotoPhoto Library dialog successfully, but it does not reliably accept a new photo image from the phone camera for upload.  More often than not Safari displays an error message something has gone wrong with this page and it has been reloaded.  Generally, if I clear the cache, close Safari and relaunch, it works again, once or twice, and then fails.  Once it has failed, it doesnt seem ever to succeed again without relaunching.p  pIts not clear if this is a buffer issue, or is even related to the file size of the new photo, but given that it does work sometimes, it doesnt appear to be an error in the code or an incompatibility with the OSbrowser.p  pAnyone experience anything similar  Any suggestions how to make this workp  pThanksp

Negative 2848 pIm banging my head against the wall on this one.p  pI have an array of objects that will be used to populate a select drop downp  precodeCardCount  [ClientId 0010, Description 0010 206 Members, ClientId 0051, Description 0051 1 Member, ........] codepre  pWhen I attempt to use ngoptions, the value of the option is set to the index, not to the ClientId as desired. To get the value in each option to be the ClientId, I have to use a ngrepeat in the options. Here is my htmlp  precodeltselect ngmodelCurrentClientgt     ltoption ngrepeatitem in CardCount valueitem.ClientIdgtitem.Descriptionltoptiongt ltselectgt codepre  pInitially, all is well, the select and options are generated correctly, and the first option is correct. Now, when a certain button is clicked somewhere else on the page, it becomes necessary to recreate this select and options with a smaller array of similar objects. However, doing so creates a blank option with a value of  string0010 . This is the option that is selected. Again, I cannot use ngoptions to correct this problem because doing so doesnt set the value attribute in the option tags correctly. So, I added this to the option tagp  precodeltoption ngrepeatitem in CardCount valueitem.ClientId ngselectedCurrentClient  item.ClientIdgtitem.Descriptionltoptiongt codepre  pNow, that does mark the correct option as selected. However, the drop down still shows the blank option.

However, it sets it to codeselectedselectedcode, and not just codeselectedcode. When I inspect element and change codeselectedselectedcode to codeselectedcode remove the equals and everything after it, the drop down then correctly displays the correctly selected option.p  pAgain, initially the select and options work great. The problem seems to happen only after the array that the select is created with is changed. How can I get this select and options working correctly after I change the array, and not show that first blank optionp  pThanksp

Shown example you can look on a hrefhttpwww.gofit.bgstoresearchwhey20protein relnofollowthis linka you can use Google translate, because the website is in bulgarian. p  pSo this is my Sphinx config file.p  precodesource content       sqlquerypre              SET NAMES utf8     sqlquery                                             SELECT p., p.productid,                              m.manname, m.manimagelocation, m.manseourl, pcr.ctgid,                              gal.imagefilelocation, pir.itemid, pav.atrid                              from 3wproducts p                              INNER JOIN 3wproductsgallery gal ON gal.productid  p.productid AND gal.showorder  1 OR gal.showorder  NULL                             LEFT OUTER JOIN 3wmanufacturers m ON m.manid  p.manid                              LEFT OUTER JOIN 3wproductscatrel pcr ON pcr.productid  p.productid                              LEFT OUTER JOIN 3wproductitemrel pir ON pir.productid  p.productid                              LEFT OUTER JOIN 3wproductattributevalues pav ON pav.productid  p.productid                                   attribute declaration       sqlattruint            productid     sqlattruint            manid     sqlattruint            productnotinstock     sqlfieldstring         productname     sqlfieldstring         manname     sqlfieldstring         productcode     sqlfieldstring         productseourl     sqlfieldstring         imagefilelocation     sqlfieldstring         productintroplain     sqlfieldstring         productsecondname     sqlfieldstring         productprice     sqlfieldstring         productpricepromo     sqlfieldstring         productpromoexpiredate     sqlfieldstring         productviews     sqlfieldstring         productrating     sqlfieldstring         productdateadded     sqlfieldstring         productpricereturned     sqlfieldstring         manimagelocation     sqlfieldstring         manseourl       sqlattruint           productexquisite     sqlattruint           productvotes     sqlattruint           productreturned       sqlattrmulti           uint itemid from field items     sqlattrmulti           uint atrid from field attributes     sqlattrmulti           uint ctgid from field categories  codepre  pAnd the PHP codep  precode        requireonceextensionslibssphinxsphinxapi.php         if params[order]              switch params[order]                  case newest                     order  productnotinstock ASC, productid DESC                     break                 case priceup                     order  productnotinstock ASC, p.productpricesell ASC                     break                 case pricedown                     order  productnotinstock ASC, p.productpricesell DESC                     break                 case views                     order  productnotinstock ASC, productviews DESC                     break                 case promoted                     order  productnotinstock ASC, p.productpricepromo DESC                     break                 case exquisite                     if params[search]                          order  p.productnotinstock ASC, p.productexquisite DESC, p.productviews DESC                         break                      else                          order  productnotinstock ASC, weight DESC, productviews DESC                            break                                      default                     order  productnotinstock ASC, weight DESC, productviews DESC                       break                                phrase  params[search]         page  issetGET[page]  GET[page]  1          client  new SphinxClient         clientgtSetLimitsparams[offset], params[limit]         clientgtSetSortModeSPHSORTEXTENDED, order         clientgtSetRankingModeSPHRANKSPH04         clientgtSetMatchModeSPHMATCHEXTENDED          clientgtSetFieldWeightsarrayproductcodegt30, productnamegt15, productmetadatagt2         ifparams[returned] clientgtsetFilterproductreturned, arrayparams[returned]         ifparams[manid] clientgtsetFiltermanid, arrayparams[manid]         ifparams[ctgid] clientgtsetFilterctgid, arrayparams[ctgid]         ifparams[properties]              foreachparams[properties] as propid gt prop clientgtsetFilteritemid, arraykeysprop[items]         ifparams[attribute] clientgtsetFilteratrid, arrayparams[attribute][atrid]          phrase  strreplace  , , phrase         query  productname .phrase.  productmetadata .phrase.  productcode .phrase.         res  clientgtQueryquery, products         products  array         foreachres[matches] as id gt product              product[attrs][productid]  id             products[]  product[attrs]                  return[result]  products         return[finded]  res[totalfound]          return return codepre  pThis, however returns proper results.

I just cant seem to figure out why so any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2848 pWeve got a small number of HLS streams that play perfectly in our desktop player, on iOS, and on Roku, but will fail on Chromecast on particular segments. However, when they do fail, it is always on the same segment for a given stream, indicating that the Chromecast is just not liking something in that segment while other platforms let it go by. p  pTheres a very good chance that the problem lies on our end, as we do a lot of complex stuff with generating custom segments before streaming,  we cant yet rule out that the problem is in Chromecast itself. I know that, in many cases, people are referred to the Chromecast issue tracker for analyzing the stream is it ok to post a bug report there even if were pretty sure the problem is on our end, just so we can get our stream reviewed Or are there tools available beyond Apples mediastreamvalidator that we can use to analyze the stream for issues so that we dont put too much burden on the Chromecast engineersp

The other part when I compile it on OS X using codegcccode, and I run it the codercode is still included in the tokenized string, because it obviously splits on codencode. If I change the delimiters to the codestrtokcode call to coderncode, it works for me.p  pIs this normal that this behaves differently on Windows and Unix How should I handle this in real life situations assuming Im trying to write portable code for Windows and Unix in C that should handle file input that uses coderncodep
Negative 2848 pI recently started playing around with codefiltered aliasescode in Elastic Search a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentindicesaliases.html relnofollowdocumentation herea but there is use case which I am not sure how to approach. p  pstrongUse Casestrongp  pEach document that I index in ElasticSearch for a fact is going to have a field called tenantId and also some other fields such as type, id etc. Now all the documents reside in the same index, so per Tenant I want to make sure I create a filtered alias. Now I want to create the filtered alias as soon as I have created the tenant itself and have the tenantId handy. p  pstrongProblemstrong p  pWhen I tried to create the alias programmatically using their java client, I get the following exception p  precodeCaused by org.elasticsearch.index.query.QueryParsingException       [mdmmaster] Strict field resolution and no field mapping       can be found for the field with name [tenantId]  codepre  pResearching more, I found out that I can probably use dynamic templates in order to achieve this. So I created a template, saved it under codeconfigtemplatescode, recreated my index and tried the same thing again. Got the same exception again. On reading the documentation more a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchreferencecurrentmappingdynamicmapping.html relnofollowherea bottom 3 lines on the page, I found out that even if I would try to change the following property codeindex.query.parse.allowunmappedfieldscode to true which I didnt try yet, for filtered aliases, it will force it to false. p  pNow the question is, how do I approach my usecase I do not know the mappings of the corresponding types but what I do know for a fact is each document that I index, regardless of the type, will ALWAYS have a field called codetenantIdcode and thats what I want to create my filtered alias on. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pCouple of helpful links that I found.

Negative 2848 pRecently I had an interview and was given a following question. The trick is solving this problem without queues, stacks, or arrays. I wasnt able to answer this question. Needless to say, I didnt get the job. How would you solve this problem.p  pYou are given a deck containing N cards.  While holding the deckp  ol liTake the top card off the deck and set it on the tableli liTake the next card off the top and put it on the bottom of the deck in your hand.li liContinue steps 1 and 2 until all cards are on the table.  This is a round.li liPick up the deck from the table and repeat steps 13 until the deck is in the original order.li ol  pWrite a program to determine how many rounds it will take to put a deck back into the original order.  This will involve creating a data structure to represent the order of the cards. Do not use an array. This program should be written in C only. It should take a number of cards in the deck as a command line argument and write the result to stdout.  Please ensure the program compiles and runs correctly no pseudocode.  This isnt a trick question it should be fairly straightforward.p
Negative 2848 pSo Im working on this project and I have this layout that works well at just about all screen resolutions, and Im trying to put the finishing touches on screen resolutions smaller than 745px.

Instead of Clefia being way faster, it was AES which was around 350 times faster than Clefia.p  pThe only reason now I can think of is that the code Clefia has posted on their official website is not optimized, which they admit as the below is a copypaste from their code.p  pcode NOTICE   This reference code is written for a clear understanding of the CLEFIA   block cipher algorithm based on the specification of CLEFIA.   Therefore, this code does not include any optimizations for   highspeed or lowcost implementations or any countermeasures against   implementation attacks.codep  pI can assume I can be wrong that the codeJavax.Cryptocode classes use much optimized version of AES.p  pThis is the only reason I can think of why there would be such a huge difference regarding in speed.p  pTherefor my questions are as follows.p  ul liWhen we say optimized what is meant technically Less rounds in favor of security different code etcli liCan the reason for such a difference in speed be explained differently that is, optimization not being the reason for such a difference in speed.li liI still could not locate an optimized version of Clefia, and I am not sure if Java has included it with their latest JDK, given Clefia is now a a hrefhttpwww.sony.netProductscryptographyclefiastandardindex.html relnofollowstandarda.

Negative 2848 pDoes anyone know which are the performances of BoboBrowse 3.2 From what I have observed, the search time grows linearly with the number of facet handlers and it does not depend on the index dimension i.e., the number of documents.

Negative 2848 pIs there a way to timeout the request sooner when a server is unavailable Im requesting a file via a script tag that times out after 21 seconds at which point the page tries to build without it. The status code for the request was 502Bad Gateway while the server was down.p  pI am making a request from a server that is up and running fine to the server that is temporarily in a fledgling state. The normal request looks like thisp  precodeltscript languageJavaScript src...someFileOnTheDownServer...gtltscriptgt codepre  pWhen the request tries to load the file, the loading of my primary page blocks and waits on the file that wont be served.p  pI can load the file asynchronously but that would also appear as a loading status until 21 seconds passes. I would prefer to wait only 25 seconds in the attempt to retrieve the file.p  pThis question looks a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq2984216469643rather similara but I thought that after 5 years there should be better alternatives, more questions on this subject, or a real solution to timeout the codeltscriptgtcode tag at a delay I specify.p  pI dont see a codetimeoutcode property yet a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebHTMLElementscript relnofollowon the MDNa for the script tag.

However, I need some pagespecific code to run once the page is loaded and not before. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7540844469643This answera seems to offer a solution but my preferred answer is in regards to being able to timeout the script loading at a specified interval.p

Negative 2848 pA few questions on stackoverflow mention this problem, but I havent found a concrete solution.p  pI have a square matrix which consists of cosine similarities values between 0 and 1, for examplep  precode    A    B    C    D A  1.0  0.1  0.6   0.4 B  0.1  1.0  0.1   0.2 C  0.6  0.1  1.0   0.7 D  0.4  0.2  0.7   1.0 codepre  pThe square matrix can be of any size. I want to get clusters I dont know how many which maximize the values between the elements in the cluster. I.e. for the above example I should get two clustersp  ol liBli liA, C, Dli ol  pThe reason being because C amp D have the highest value between them, and A amp C also have the highest value between them.p  pAn item can be in only one cluster.p  pRecall is not that important for this problem, but precision is very important. It is acceptable to output three clusters 1 B, 2 A, 3 C, D . But it is not acceptable to output any solution where B is in a cluster with another element.p  pI think the diagonal 1.0 is confusing me. My data is guaranteed to have at least one cluster of 2 elements, and I want to find as many clusters as possible without sacrificing precision.p  pI will have to implement this in Python.p
Negative 2848 pAre there any technical reasons to optimize imports via your editor Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, and NetBeans all have ways to optimize imports. Im wondering if there are reasons other than consistency. Also, is there a more optimal way of importing Ive seen different standards that individuals and orginations have for optimizing imports. For example...p  precodeimport java.util.Map import java.util.List  import com.company.MyClassThatUsesMap codepre  pIf I understand right, in the above example the classloader will load the codeMapcode and codeListcode classes before codeMyClassThatUsesMapcode.

Negative 2848 pI have a UICollectionViewCell that is loaded from a xib and stored in a property to help with calculating cell sizes for my collection view. The collection view always has only one column, so the cells vary in their widths based on the phone the user has iphone 566.

The system never breaks this extra height constraint I did not add, so the height of the cell is always this incorrect height of the view at design time in the xib.p  pCan I somehow remove this extraneous constraint that causes this to not work Is there some other setting to set here that does what I need Ive tried turning off codetranslatesAutoResizingMaskIntoConstraintscode to no avail as well.

I didnt particularly like the way the image was rendered as a pattern in the sites background this was the main reason I instituted the use of the Advanced CSS operator that was previously mentioned. Perusing your forums I also made use of various viewportspecific properties with none of these options having yielded the desired outcome. I also applied the use of the following command, also to no availp  precode      body           background urlimagesbg.jpg norepeat center center fixed          webkitbackgroundsize cover         mozbackgroundsize cover         obackgroundsize cover         backgroundsize cover          codepre  pDue to the fact that the duplication of said operations on two of my test blogs ellicits different results, in as much that the sites background image retains its original dimensions, I believe that this error can be traced back to the web pages coding, though I have yet to pinpoint its origin.p  pThis is a frustrating predicament, to say the least, any assistance you can provide that would lead to the resolution of this particular issue would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 2848 pI am in a workflow where I regularly have to install an application locally, and then sync the folders of that application now installed locally with an SVN repository hosted in another folder on my computer.p  pI have successfully created this workflow using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comselkhateebhardlink relnofollowhardlinka commandline utility. To do this I first deleted the folders in my local installation of the application, and then used the hardlink command line utility to link the SVN repo folders with the folders that were then created in the local installation directory.p  pThe problem with this workflow is that it is very slow and requires manual input, which doesnt work if I need to repeat this process regularly which I do.p  pI have tried other bidirectional file synchronization programs Unison etc, but they seem to not cover the need that I have, where the synchronization happens automatically without the need to run the given program.p  pBased on this, I am thinking of writing a bash script that will automate this process for me. Beyond writing that bash script, is there a simpler process that  I have overlookedp

Negative 2848 pWhat is the most efficient in terms of processing speed and memory utilisation method for passing a large number of userinput variables as arguments to a function, and for returning multiple resultsp  pA long string of arguments and return values each time I call the function  e.g. a,b,c,d,e,f,g  MyFunctiona,b,c,d,e,f,g  seems inelegant, and Im guessing is also inefficient especially if I have to call the function repeatedly or recursively.p  pHowever defining the whole list of variables as Global outside of the function also is ugly, and carries the danger of variable names being inadvertently assigned to several different variables as my program grows.p  pIve tried putting all the variables into a single array or list and passed that to the function as a single argument, as this seems neater. Am I correct in thinking that this is also more efficient, even for huge arrays, since it is only the pointer to the start of the array that is passed to the function each time, not the whole array itself  If arrays are the best method for passing a large number of variables tofrom a function, at what point does this efficiency saving kick in  e.g. is it better to pass a string of arguments if the number of arguments is less than 5, but use an array or list if 5 or more arguments are requiredp  pA previous discussion on StackExchange a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24952190elegantwaytopassmultipleargumentstoafunctionElegant way to pass multiple arguments to a functiona has recommended using struct rather than vectorsarrays for passing multiple arguments. Why is this method preferred to using arrays, and at what point do efficiency savings justify the added complexity of using struct p  pAre there any other methods that I should consider which will work in Python or CC e.g. Im new to object orientated programming, but wonder if this might offer a solution which is specific  to Pythonp  pMany thanksp

And it works fine since Im using a modern version of PHP 5.5.28.

In this case, static functions cannot be called on the dynamic class codethisgtdynClassSomeFunctioncode fails and codethisgtdynClassSomeFunctioncode fails as well. However codeinstance  new thisgtdynClasscode works. So if I need to call a static method on codethisgtdynClasscode, I have to create a local variable storing the same string codetmp  thisgtdynClasscode.

Negative 2848 pAll,  I have a web page that loads data from 46 tables in 4 Oracle databases for approximately 10 schemas each on demand.  What I have setup is a require at the top of the page such asp  precodeltphp requireoncesrcconnectsclient1.php requireoncesrcconnectsclient2.php requireoncesrcconnectsclient3.php requireoncesrcconnectsclient4.php gt codepre  pEach of those files contains a connect string such asp  precodeconnClient  ocipconnectLogin, Password, database1521 codepre  pAnd a series of queries and executes such asp  precodedailystatusClientSCHEMA  ociparseconnClient, select  from OPSSCHEMA.DAILYSTATUS order by tablename  ociexecutedailystatusClientSCHEMA codepre  pThis is then a part of a Jquery based tree view with a series of unordered lists and a PHP foreach loop that prints each row of data appropriately for the query results. p  pSome of the result sets contain upwards of a thousand rows of data.  This works, and displays the data in a usable format.p  pThe problem is it takes 1 minute 52 seconds to load.  The enduser for this in the company thinks this is too long, and frankly I think it is too long also.  I am not a web developer, but it was most logical for this project to fall within our team so here I am.p  pAre there any ways that I can force all of the queries to load in a more simultaneous manner so that the data can be returned more quickly  This is a VERY fast Exadata environment, so I dont believe there is any bottleneck at the DB and the web server has light load at any given time so I dont think theres a limit there, just in how Ive built this page.p  pI really appreciate any solution to this one may provide.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2848 pAre there any standardstechnologiesexamples of strongpublic facing APIsstrong which would exhibit similar patterns to an AMQPSTOMPMQTT serverp  pRabbitMQ fits almost perfectly in this setup apart from one big shortcoming, that is its not hardened for public facing. userpass or IP authentication the port can still be hammered, etc. There is no ability to set peruser throttling.p  pBroadly speaking an API standard or design which would behave similar to SMPP, where by a payload can be sent by a client, it can be processed, then the client would also be able to stream responses from the same server either immediately or batched for later retrieval.

Negative 2848 pSo I use a ngif to cycle through the use of 6 different templates which each contain approx. 12 lines of html code.

Seems somewhat repetitive the way it is now.p  pAdditionally, as I mentioned, my templates are each about 1215 lines of code times 6. For such small templates, is this best way to approach with angular in a view with less than 500 lines of code or should they be broken out into a single or multiple partials They wont be used in any other view at this point.p  pThanks much for the helpp

If the reason cant be guessed Ill try to post the code somehow.p  pIll post the link to demonstrate the problem a hrefhttpimmobiliaretest.altervista.orgcercasvlistampprGRampsGRampct1ampcg1amptptutteampcs1 relnofollowhttpimmobiliaretest.altervista.orgcercasvlistampprGRampsGRampct1ampcg1amptptutteampcs1ap  pP.S.

Negative 2848 pI am using a test project which has 2 test suites. First Test Suite has state dependent steps like  Address Test Case   Given request is made with an  Address When response with a valid address is received Then do necessary action  Address Test Case    Address Test Case   The address for each test case is set at test case level. Each individual step has a script that calls other library test suite amp then calls a basic test step in that test suite and passes the parameters to that test case. So Given step in first test suite is as belowp  precodedef proj null def workspace  testRunner.testCase.testSuite.project.getWorkspace proj workspace.getProjectByNameABC def testCase  proj.testSuites[ABC Library].testCases[Successful ABC Steps ] testRunner.testCase.setPropertyValue addressLine1, 1111 Winters Chapel Rd NW, Atlanta, GA 30360  testRunner.testCase.setPropertyValue city, Atlanta  testRunner.testCase.setPropertyValue state, GA  def testStep  testCase.getTestStepByNameGiven a request with a valid address is made def runner  null runner  testStep.runtestRunner, context codepre  pand the corresponding step in library has below as part of the request and actual webservice end pointp  precodeltaddress xsitypensUSPostalAddressgt ltnsaddressLine1gtTestCaseaddressLine1ltnsaddressLine1gt ltnscitygtTestCasecityltnscitygt ltnsstategt ltnsnamegtTestCasestateltnsnamegt ltnsstategt ltaddressgt codepre  pThis test case works fine in SoapUi, but when trying to run through java, I am not able to pass the parameters for a test step from a test suite to other test step in another test suite in the same project xml. Also since the first test step is a script, it just tells runner status is INITIALIZED but how do I get the request xml and response xml which are actually called in the internally called test step. Please help. Thanks in advance...p
