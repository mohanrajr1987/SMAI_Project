Positive 1065 pIm trying to do now, using Fragments. Below I leave the code used so far. The idea is, the behavior I want is that initially the fragment with the animation and once you finish the animation display slides up to fragment and then let them see the main layout. But what is happening is that initially shows for a moment the main layout and quickly after the fragment is shown in the animation. Here I leave part of the code used.p  pThis is my main activity layoutp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools

Positive 1065 pIve implemented a UIScrollView within a UITableViewCell that enables the user to scroll left and right to reveal buttons in the same fashion as the iOS Mail app. The original implementation that set frames and positions explicitly worked well but Ive refactored the code to use autolayout throughout. Animation to hidereveal the container for the buttons on the left accessory buttons works well but the animation that brings the scrollview to rest when the right container edit buttons slows just before reaching the desired offset before jerking into its final position.p  pAll calculations use the same math just transformed e.g.  rather than  value,  rather than lt in tests depending on the side the container is located and the values displayed by logging are correct. I cant see any obvious code errors and there are no constraints for the cells set up in IB. Is this a bug or is there something obvious Ive missed through staring at the code for the last hourp  precodeclass SwipeyTableViewCell UITableViewCell        MARK Constants     private let

Positive 1065 pSome clarification first. strongThere are several kinds of animations in high charts.strong I am only interested in the strongbeginning animationstrong that draws a line graph when strongadding a seriesstrong.p  pThat being said, it appears that if a series is in the middle of its beginning animation and is removed, the animation will finish drawing and stay permanently on the chart. A new series that is added will not redraw.p  pIs there a way to remove that specific series beginning animation, or redraw the chart in order to refresh it I assume recreating the entire chart can accomplish this but it will not serve my purposes. I need the first series to remain drawn without triggering the beginning animation for the first, but the second has to have a beginning animation so that it can animate over top of the first.p  pHeres an example of the issue for reproductionp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction   var data1  [null, null, null, null, null, 6, 11, 32, 110, 235, 369, 640,                 1005, 1436, 2063, 3057, 4618, 6444, 9822, 15468, 20434, 24126,                 27387, 29459, 31056, 31982, 32040, 31233, 29224, 27342, 26662,                 26956, 27912, 28999, 28965, 27826, 25579, 25722, 24826, 24605,                 24304, 23464, 23708, 24099, 24357, 24237, 24401, 24344, 23586,                 22380, 21004, 17287, 14747, 13076, 12555, 12144, 11009, 10950,                 10871, 10824, 10577, 10527, 10475, 10421, 10358, 10295, 10104]  var animatedData   color FF00FF, data data1  var animatedData   data data1  var data  [name USA, data data1, animatedData]  function reanimateChart  var chart  container.highcharts chart.series[1].remove chart.addSeriesanimatedData chart.redraw   btn1.clickfunction   reanimateChart       btn2.clickfunction   reanimateChart setTimeoutreanimateChart, 100           container.highcharts         chart              type area         ,         title              text US and USSR nuclear stockpiles         ,         subtitle              text Source lta hrefhttpthebulletin.metapress.comcontentc4120650912x74k7fulltext.pdfgt                  thebulletin.metapress.comltagt         ,         xAxis              allowDecimals false,             labels                  formatter function                       return this.value  clean, unformatted number for year                                       ,         yAxis              title                  text Nuclear weapon states             ,             labels                  formatter function                       return this.value  1000  k                                       ,         tooltip              pointFormat series.name produced ltbgtpoint.y,.0fltbgtltbrgtwarheads in point.x         ,         plotOptions              area                  pointStart 1940,                 marker                      enabled false,                     symbol circle,                     radius 2,                     states                          hover                              enabled true                                                                                     ,         series data      codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.3jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.highcharts.comhighcharts.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.highcharts.commodulesexporting.jsgtltscriptgt  ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontainer styleminwidth 310px height 400px margin 0 autogtltdivgt     ltdivgtltbutton idbtn1gtreanimateltbuttongtltdivgt     ltdivgtltbutton idbtn2gtbreak animationltbuttongtltdivgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p

Positive 1065 pSo my question is more of a challenge in the end. Maybe Im going into a wrong direction so I though maybe I could ask for ideas.p  pstrongthe contextstrongp  pI have a set of string place names and I want to suggest answers based on user inputs in a UITextView.p  pstrongThe methodstrongp  pI Used a combination of two UILabels and one UITextView to achieve a working results The suggestionLabel is in the background, the searchLabel in the middle, and a searchInput text view on the foreground. The textview enables interaction but texts alpha is set to 0 I didnt want to consume time with padding and insets relative to the various screen size and autolayout constraints I have. When typing, the changes are reflected on the searchLabel, and the suggestion based on inputs on the suggestionLabel.p  pstrongThe goalstrongp  pIts a visual goal. when the user select a place based on suggestion, the places profile fades in and its title is set at the exact same place than was the search text. all of this to serve a good looking transition.p  pstrongThe challengestrongp  pThe search input, label and places profile title have to be centered Im speaking about text alignment here. To make this work with the different layer of text, I used a set of auto layout constraints where blocks are centered in the views, with dynamic width, and an original text alignment set to .Leftp  pHaving the alignment set to .Center breaks the text layers perfect overlap. So, I though about keeping it this way and make the transition from .Left alignement to .Center when users validate their choices.p  pMy problem is that textAlignment doesnt seems to be something that we can smoothly animate.

I really dont understand why this happens, and how to make it the same on the two phones. I thought that using an orthographic camera with ingame units and a viewport would do the job...but i might be doing something wrong...because it doesnt. I am following the book libgdx crossplatform game development cookbook. I would hugely appreciate any help on how to properly use in game units to get the game to be the same on different screen sizes, so that a 512x512pixel image..isnt tiny on the note4 and huge on the zenfone each frame of my animation is 512px squared.

Positive 1065 pFor a project a site is needed where when first loaded an animation appears that fades away and reveals the content of the site. I am fine with creating the animation and all. What I am not sure about is where to place it.p  pFrom a site ia point of view I see it like this. Either have the animation on the index page and once done remove that element with js or  and reveal the index page. This means a reload will always show the animation again. This also means a click on the main logo that leads to the index page will also play the animation again. Something not really wanted or needed.p  pThe only other option I see is having the animation on the index page and once done redirect to the home page where the site content is located. Like this a click on the logo can be set to either the home page or the index page. The info on the home page is also visible without watching the animation again since the home page has a separate nav link in the menu. Only if desired can the animation be watched again by clicking on the main logo.p  pFrom my perspective it will be the later. Though I ask you is this good practise Is it OK to just have an animation on the index page and everything else on the home pagep  pI was thinking to either post this in a hrefhttpsux.stackexchange.comhttpsux.stackexchange.coma or a hrefhttpsgraphicdesign.stackexchange.comhttpsgraphicdesign.stackexchange.coma but I think this more concerns code architecture rather than design or ux because as mentioned the animation could also be loaded dynamically on the index page and once gone the content is shown on the index page. So you see I am not asking for opinion but rather for the right logic to tackle this task.p  pWhat method is best applied for this scenario Would you consider having the animation on the index page and then redirect to the home pagep  precodeLinked httpsstackoverflow.comquestions22090313showananimationbeforeshowmyindexhtml httpsstackoverflow.comquestions503093howcanimakearedirectpageusingjquery httpwww.submittoday.comsplashpagesandsearchengineoptimization.html httpstackoverflow.coma220903891010918 httpsstackoverflow.comquestions30573395pageloadinganimationmethod httpsstackoverflow.comquestions1964839jquerypleasewaitloadinganimation codepre

Project is an SVNchecked out project. p  pWhen I need to make a change, I do so, save it and hit my local computer that has apache setup to read from those files in that project. Mostly they are Webservices or just 1 file  not whole projects. p  pI got started on another project that required me to use a full domain name because it required parsing subdomains so I setup my local apache to use that domain name, even though it wasnt pointed to me. Using foxyProxy and making http.domain.com and a hrefhttpdomain.com relnofollowhttpdomain.coma as one rule and pointing it to 127.0.0.1  this allows me use the www.domain.com but hit the dev machine which is mine. p  pI commit the changes, and run this sort of ghetto bash script that checks out the code off SVN and syncs to all the servers using RSYNC.p  pWell, soon we will get a designer to work with me.

Its one of those questions where something is bothering me and Im not capable of crystallizing the question in my mind enough to make some sense of it. So I ask a half assed questions hoping that replies will help me with that.  Anyways, its a pointless question but I would still like to explain what Ive actually meant by itp  pwhat prompted all of this was an article from MSDN where it saidp  blockquote   pPrimary expressions are divided between arraycreationexpressions and primarynoarraycreationexpressions. Treating arraycreationexpression in this way, rather than listing it along with the other simple expression forms, enables the grammar to disallow potentially confusing code such asp      pobject o  new int[3][1]p      pwhich would otherwise be interpreted asp      pobject o  new int[3][1]p blockquote  pso that got me thinking that perhaps parenthesis around different parts of this array creation expression would give compiler different instructions on the type of array it should create. p  pOr to put it differently, I thought that perhaps compiler follows some buildin logic  derived from some math field  when interpreting array creationinitialization syntax. In other words, compiler didnt build an array due to its developers giving it specific instruction such as emwhen you see words strongnewstrong and strongname of some typestrong and strongtwo pairs of square brackets [] []strong, then follow these stepbystep instructions , which will tell you in full details what to doem, but instead developers just build in some math related logic and from that compiler was capable deriving an array by itself, without developers giving it step by step instructions.   p  pBTW  I do understand about jagged and rectangular arrays and how they are initialized etc  p

Negative 1065 pOk so ive been working on a fairly complex batch file that basicly asks the user to create a text file that contains 6 or more lines of text. Then it takes that file and changes every instance of every letter to its respective number for example if the first line of the text file said programable then the program would change all instances of the letter a into 1 and b into 2 and so on until it was all numbers. It would then read 16 18 15 7 18 1 13 1 2 12 5 and i would do that by using the following scriptp  precodeset p varlt text.txt set varvara1 echo.var gtgt text.txt codepre  pHowever the only problem with this script is that it will only change the letter a on the first line to 1, not the letter a in the rest of the document.p  pI also tried splitting the document at the beginning of the program so that when the user types the text for the first line it sends it to a separate hidden file text1.txt instead of just sending all of the lines of text that the user types, into one text file text.txtp  pI did so using thisp  precodeset p line1type the first line echo line1 gtgt text1.txt attrib h text1.txt set p line2type the second line echo line2 gtgt text2.txt attrib h text2.txt    Im not going to repeat this 6 times but hopefully you get my point   codepre  pNow the problem with splitting the lines into separate files is that it would be inefficient and extremely time consuming to change all instances of every letter into their respective numbers, and do it for each line or in this situation, file that the user inputs... If it would help if i put all this in context, here is the script for my program so far, for the LOADING subscript i am currently using the method i explained earlier where i split the lines into files. p  pCode Save As stringparsing.batp  precode echo off  title BETA  cls  echo.  echo.  echo.  echo      Setting Variables...  echo      Loading Language Database...

Negative 1065 pI am trying to plot a curve of y  fx for various functions, and I want the plot to be as good quality as possible. That said, I would prefer to avoid rendering individual pixels in my Java code for performance reasons.p  pIn other words, I want to squeeze as much quality as I can out of Java2D.p  pCurrently I am calculating float x,y values for each pixel in the x direction. Then I am creating a Shape by drawing lines between these points using float values for the point coords.

Negative 1065 pI have a emmatrixem which represents an image and I need to cycle over strongeach pixelstrong and for each one of those I have to compute the sum of all its strongneighborsstrong, ie the pixels that belong to a window of radius coderadcode centered on the pixel. p  pI came up with three alternativesp  ul liThe simplest way, the one that recomputes the window for each pixelli liThe more optimized way that uses a queue to store the sums of the window columns and cycling through the columns of the matrix updates this queue by adding a new element and removing the oldesli liThe even more optimized way that does not need to recompute the queue for each row but incrementally adjusts a previously saved oneli ul  pI implemented them in strongcstrong using a emqueueem for the second method and a combination of emdequesem for the third I need to iterate through their elements without destructing them and scored their times to see if there was an actual improvement. it appears that the third method is indeed faster.p  pThen I tried to port the code to Java and I must admit that Im not very comfortable with it. I used emArrayDequeem for the second method and emLinkedListsem for the third resulting in the third being inefficient in time.p  pHere is the simplest method in C Im not posting the java version since it is almost identicalp  precodevoid normalWindowingint  mat[][MAX], int cols, int rows, int rad     int i, j     int h  0     for i  0 i lt rows i              for j  0 j lt cols j                       h  0             for int ry  rad ry lt rad ry                               int y  i  ry                 if y gt 0 ampamp y lt rows                                       for int rx  rad rx lt rad rx                                               int x  j  rx                         if x gt 0 ampamp x lt cols                                                       h  mat[y][x]                                                                                               codepre  pHere is the second method the one optimized through columns in Cp  precode void opt1Windowingint  mat[][MAX], int cols, int rows, int rad     int i, j, h, y, col     queueltintgt q  NULL     for i  0 i lt rows i              if q  NULL             deleteq         q  new queueltintgt         h  0         for int rx  0 rx lt rad rx                       if rx lt cols                               int mem  0                 for int ry  rad ry lt rad ry                                      y  i  ry                     if y gt 0 ampamp y lt rows                                              mem  mat[y][rx]                                                        qgtpushmem                 h  mem                               for j  1 j lt cols j                       col  j  rad             if j  rad gt 0                              h  qgtfront                 qgtpop                          if j  rad lt cols                              int mem  0                 for int ry  rad ry lt rad ry                                      y  i  ry                     if y gt 0 ampamp y lt rows                                              mem  mat[y][col]                                                        qgtpushmem                 h  mem                             codepre  pAnd here is the Java versionp  precodepublic static void opt1Windowingint [][] mat, int rad     int i, j  0, h, y, col     int cols  mat[0].length     int rows  mat.length     ArrayDequeltIntegergt q  null     for i  0 i lt rows i              q  new ArrayDequeltIntegergt         h  0         for int rx  0 rx lt rad rx                      if rx lt cols                              int mem  0                 for int ry  rad ry lt rad ry                                      y  i  ry                     if y gt 0 ampamp y lt rows                                              mem  mat[y][rx]                                                       q.addLastmem                 h  mem                               j  0         for j  1 j lt cols j                      col  j  rad             if j  rad gt 0                              h  q.peekFirst                 q.pop                          if j  rad lt cols                              int mem  0                 for int ry  rad ry lt rad ry                                      y  i  ry                     if y gt 0 ampamp y lt rows                                              mem  mat[y][col]                                                       q.addLastmem                 h  mem                             codepre  pI recognize this post will be a wall of text.

Negative 1065 pOn Windows, no matter which framework you use, all the frameworks need, ultimately, to call the user mode user32CreateWindowEx API to actually create a window on the desktop.p  pOn Ubuntu, or indeed Linux systems in general, it seems that the choices are to use a widget framework like Wx or Qt or GTK to create a GUI application, but all these frameworks feel like they are wrapping something more fundamental. Do these all talk directly to X on Linux I thought Ubuntu was moving to a non X window manager, so what are they going to use thenp  pWhat library would I use to access the window manager all these frameworks usep
Negative 1065 pI need to release some software quite frequently, and the software is contained as a VMWare disk file, i.e., code.vmdkcode file.  What I want is some kind of binary diff and patch utility to make the delta generated as small as possible.p
Negative 1065 pIm working on an application , I currently I have a database the rows are transferred to arrays then displayed in a datatable.p  pIm a novice with this, Id just like to know what is the best way to edit these rows. I can retrieve a row by the id in some edittext boxes then edit and update. But is there a more intuitive way to do this for the user like an alternative to a datatable where the table itself its editablep  pHopefully I explained that well enoughp  pAdvice would be great, thanksp

Negative 1065 pIve been adding to an existing application by generating with seamgen and adjusting from there.

Negative 1065 pWhen I use MediaPlayer to play video in an Activity that themed as a dialog or with the windowIsFloating property I get a shadow overlaying the video the dialog background shadow. Why And how do I get rid of it I guess it has something to do with the SufaceViews nature of having a zorder behind the window and punching holes in front of it.p  pThe reason why i use the windowIsFloating property is that i need to have the previous activity paused to resume it as fast as possible. I know it can be closed by the OS then as well. But thats OK since it seams that most of the time I dont have to reinitialize the activity.p  pOr are there any other way to keep my previous activity in a paused statelike when using dialog while starting my second activityp

I found a neat C a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBtabstabstrips.aspx relnofollowTabStrip controla, but its incomplete because it is not a TabPage container it cant hold child panels.

I want a completely different appearance than you get from the standard TabControl. Based on code for a a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBmiscctrlDesignTimeWizard.aspx relnofollowwizard controla, it looks like I need to make a class derived from System.Windows.Forms.Design.ParentControlDesigner to handle the designtime interaction, but this is a problem because the Compact Framework does not include System.Design.dll.p  pI found a couple of articles a hrefhttpsymbian.syscon.comnode113332 relnofollowonea and a hrefhttpwww.mooseworkssoftware.comVS200520Control.htm relnofollowtwoa about writing Compact Framework custom controls.

I want to implement the same kind of editinplace functionality that youd find, say, when editing filenames in Windows Explorer, and Im finding it to be a whole lot of work.p  pWhat I have so far is a codeContextMenucode that initiates the edit.  Its bound to a command in the view model that sets an codeIsEditingDescriptioncode property.  The item template is styled so that it displays the codeDescriptioncode in a codeTextBlockcode when codeIsEditingDescriptioncode is false, and in a codeTextBoxcode when codeIsEditingDescriptioncode is true.  The setter on codeDescriptioncode sets codeIsEditingDescriptioncode to false after setting the description.p  pThis works remarkably well.

Negative 1065 pIm trying to figure out how to use Spring MVC and Ive put together a sample application to do so.  I used Roo for basic set up, but Ive added a fair bit of my own stuff.p  pIm trying to use JPA with transactions to interact with my MySQL database, but, from what I can tell, the transactions are not ever being created.  I traced this out to a call to the EntityManagerFactoryUtils.doGetTransactionalEntityManager method and it seems to fail on checking TransactionSynchronizationManager.isSynchronizationActivep  pIve looked at other people having this problem and it looks like they needed to add the Transactional annotation to their service classes, but I already had that and it wasnt working.p  pHere is my set upp  h2web.xmlh2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingISO88591gt ltwebapp xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee     xmlnswebhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeewebapp25.xsd    xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee     httpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeewebapp25.xsd version2.5gt   ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtcontextConfigLocationltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegtclasspathMETAINFspringapplicationContext.xmlltparamvaluegt   ltcontextparamgt   ltlistenergt     ltlistenerclassgt       org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener     ltlistenerclassgt   ltlistenergt   ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtOpenEntityManagerInViewFilterltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgt       org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter     ltfilterclassgt   ltfiltergt   ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtOpenEntityManagerInViewFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt   ltfiltermappinggt   ltservletgt     ltservletnamegtmvcTestltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgt       org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet     ltservletclassgt     ltinitparamgt       ltparamnamegtcontextConfigLocationltparamnamegt       ltparamvaluegtWEBINFspringwebmvcconfig.xmlltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltloadonstartupgt1ltloadonstartupgt   ltservletgt   ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtmvcTestltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngt.dolturlpatterngt   ltservletmappinggt   ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtmvcTestltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt   ltservletmappinggt   ltwelcomefilelistgt     ltwelcomefilegthome.jspltwelcomefilegt   ltwelcomefilelistgt ltwebappgt codepre  h2applicationContext.xmlh2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standalonenogt ltbeans xmlnshttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans      xmlnsaophttpwww.springframework.orgschemaaop      xmlnscontexthttpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext      xmlnsjeehttpwww.springframework.orgschemajee      xmlnstxhttpwww.springframework.orgschematx      xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance      xsischemaLocationhttpwww.springframework.orgschemaaop          httpwww.springframework.orgschemaaopspringaop3.0.xsd         httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeans3.0.xsd         httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontextspringcontext3.0.xsd         httpwww.springframework.orgschemajee httpwww.springframework.orgschemajeespringjee3.0.xsd         httpwww.springframework.orgschematx httpwww.springframework.orgschematxspringtx3.0.xsdgt      lt         This will automatically locate any and all property files you have         within your classpath, provided they fall under the METAINFspring         directory. The located property files are parsed and their values can         then be used within application context files in the form of         propertyKey.     gt     ltcontextpropertyplaceholder locationclasspathMETAINFspring.propertiesgt     lt         Turn on AspectJ Configurable support. As a result, any time you         instantiate an object, Spring will attempt to perform dependency         injection on that object. This occurs for instantiation via the new         keyword, as well as via reflection. This is possible because AspectJ         is used to weave Roobased applications at compile time. In effect         this feature allows dependency injection of any object at all in your         system, which is a very useful feature without Configurable youd         only be able to dependency inject objects acquired from Spring or         subsequently presented to a specific Spring dependency injection         method. Roo applications use this useful feature in a number of         areas, such as PersistenceContext injection into entities.     gt     ltcontextspringconfiguredgt     lt         This declaration will cause Spring to locate every Component,         Repository and Service in your application. In practical terms this         allows you to write a POJO and then simply annotate the new POJO as an         Service and Spring will automatically detect, instantiate and         dependency inject your service at startup time. Importantly, you can         then also have your new service injected into any other class that         requires it simply by declaring a field for your service inside the         relying class and Spring will inject it. Note that two exclude filters         are declared. The first ensures that Spring doesnt spend time         introspecting Roospecific ITD aspects. The second ensures Roo doesnt         instantiate your Controller classes, as these should be instantiated         by a web tier application context. Refer to web.xml for more details         about the web tier application context setup services.          Furthermore, this turns on Autowired, PostConstruct etc support. These          annotations allow you to use common Spring and Java Enterprise Edition          annotations in your classes without needing to do any special configuration.          The most commonly used annotation is Autowired, which instructs Spring to         dependency inject an object into your class.     gt     ltcontextcomponentscan basepackagecom.sedi.testgt         ltcontextexcludefilter expressionorg.springframework.stereotype.Controller typeannotationgt     ltcontextcomponentscangt     ltbean classorg.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource destroymethodclose iddataSourcegt         ltproperty namedriverClassName valuedatabase.driverClassNamegt         ltproperty nameurl valuedatabase.urlgt         ltproperty nameusername valuedatabase.usernamegt         ltproperty namepassword valuedatabase.passwordgt         ltproperty nametestOnBorrow valuetruegt         ltproperty nametestOnReturn valuetruegt         ltproperty nametestWhileIdle valuetruegt         ltproperty nametimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis value1800000gt         ltproperty namenumTestsPerEvictionRun value3gt         ltproperty nameminEvictableIdleTimeMillis value1800000gt         ltproperty namevalidationQuery valueSELECT 1gt     ltbeangt     ltbean classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager idtransactionManagergt         ltproperty nameentityManagerFactory refentityManagerFactorygt     ltbeangt     lttxannotationdrivengt      ltbean classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.support.PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor gt      ltbean classorg.springframework.dao.annotation.PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessorgt      ltbean classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean identityManagerFactorygt         ltproperty namepersistenceUnitName valuepersistenceUnitgt         ltproperty namedataSource refdataSourcegt     ltbeangt ltbeansgt codepre  h2webmvcconfig.xmlh2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standalonenogt ltbeans xmlnshttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans      xmlnscontexthttpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext      xmlnsmvchttpwww.springframework.orgschemamvc      xmlnsphttpwww.springframework.orgschemap      xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance      xsischemaLocationhttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans          httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeans3.0.xsd         httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontextspringcontext3.0.xsd         httpwww.springframework.orgschemamvc httpwww.springframework.orgschemamvcspringmvc3.0.xsdgt      lt The controllers are autodetected POJOs labeled with the Controller annotation. gt     ltcontextcomponentscan basepackagecom.sedi.test usedefaultfiltersfalsegt         ltcontextincludefilter expressionorg.springframework.stereotype.Controller typeannotationgt     ltcontextcomponentscangt      lt Turns on support for mapping requests to Spring MVC Controller methods          Also registers default Formatters and Validators for use across all Controllers gt     ltmvcannotationdriven gt      lt Handles HTTP GET requests for resources by efficiently serving up static resources gt     ltmvcresources location, classpathMETAINFwebresources mappingresourcesgt      lt Allows for mapping the DispatcherServlet to  by forwarding static resource requests to the containers default Servlet gt     ltmvcdefaultservlethandlergt      lt register global interceptor beans to apply to all registered HandlerMappings gt     ltmvcinterceptorsgt         ltbean classorg.springframework.web.servlet.theme.ThemeChangeInterceptorgt         ltbean classorg.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.LocaleChangeInterceptor pparamNamelanggt     ltmvcinterceptorsgt      lt selects a static view for rendering without the need for an explicit controller gt     ltmvcviewcontroller path viewnameindexgt     ltmvcviewcontroller pathuncaughtExceptiongt     ltmvcviewcontroller pathresourceNotFoundgt     ltmvcviewcontroller pathdataAccessFailuregt      lt Resolves localized messages.properties and application.properties files in the application to allow for internationalization.

Negative 1065 pI have a realtime app where I am animating certain elements on the screen back and forth upon certain websocketenabled events firing e.g event moveLeft and event moveRight. When the user visits another browser tab and returns after many of these events have fired, they see the entire sequence of animation carry out using .animate upon each event firing even though they are no longer relevant to the user. What I would like instead is for the animations to effectively happen while the user is tabbed away so that when they revisit the tab, they see the current world state and simply miss all those animations that were triggered while in another browser tab. p  pI cant seem to find any documentation on this issue it bears similarity to the solution where you need to call .stop before animating other mutually exclusive things so that you get dont a buildup after excessive mouseover events, but that is not really applicable here. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1065 pi am going to implement a client  server application in java. Client and server communicate with each other via TCP. There is only one central server, who handles all Client messages.p  pI dont use RMI for the communication, they communicate with tcpsockets and a client can communicate with another client through the server. That means that the server forwards messages from client A to client B.p  pNow im sitting here and try to figure out how to design the server application. p  pSo the server is listen for incomming connections all the time. Thats fine. For every new client, that get connected to the server dialup, the server create a new Socket and i would use Threads to let them work concurrently.p  pEvery User uses a client, and every client must be authenticated with a username and password.p  pIm searching for a design pattern to implement on the Server, that storeshandles the Socket connection to a client.p  pMy first idea was to create a big Singleton object called ClientManager that contains a Map. So the Server could  call something like ClientManger.getSocketByusername to get the Socket of the desired User Client.p  pThis could solve the forwarding of messages from Client A to Client B.p  pFor expample User A Client A would like to send a message to User B Client B. So the server receives the message from User A Client A and call ClientManager.getSocketByUser B to get the communication socket to the User B, and then send the message through this Socket.p  pBut this design on the server side seems to me to simple as it could be a good design for such a thing, and im missing something like Events, Observer etc.p  pAnother possibility could be to throw an Event to the Thread that handles the User B socket connection instad of calling the Socket.send method directly.p  pBut there must be a better way ...p  pIs there a common way to implement something like this a design pattern that you can recommend Im wondering how a instant messanger server would implement thisp  pBy the way im not implementing a instant messanger and the scalability is not the most important thing, since there are not 1000 of clients at the same time communicating with the server. A clean software design is more important for me.p  pIm implementing a own Protocol xml based for the communication. Is there a waydesign pattern how to wrap a protocol in a object or is there nothing i could do from the sofware architects view excepted string  xml parsingp

Negative 1065 pFurther help on my assignment I asked about earlier. After reading a character string from stdin, it checks for any nonascii characters. Any it finds will display its value in hexadecimal and the zero offset. I got it to display the hexadecimal just fine, but Im having a hard time figuring out how to display the offset. This is my current code for it as of asking this question, showing only the relevant lines.p  precodedefine MASK 0x80  auto int inChar  if inChar amp MASK  MASK      printfNONASCII INPUT x detected at offset x n, inChar, inChar     nonascii  1  codepre  pThere is another thing I need help with, hopefully this will be easier to answer though. If the line read has nothing but ASCII, it is to write out as such and display the total number of bytes read. I know how to do this with integers and multiplication by simply counting the number of times a do while is done, but the professor seems to want us to do it in a more direct manner.p  pThis is my code for that as of writing.p  precodeif nonascii  0     printfThe input stream was pure ASCII with a total of d bytes read, numBytes amp inChar codepre  pMuch thanks to those who help me with this.p
Negative 1065 pIm using OSMdroid to implement a mapping application.p  pI have implemented a custom MapTileProvider that uses a tile source that allows zoom levels up to 22.p  pThe default MAPNIK provider only allows zooms to level 18.p  pThe problem is that any PathOverlay instances draw perfectly until zoom level 19, but then are not drawn properly at zoom level 2022. it looks like someones rubbed out the path with an eraser over 90 of the path length see screenshots below.p  pIve stepped through the draw method of PathOverlay and exerything emseemsem to be calculating correctly the intermediate points appear correct for ZoomLevel 22, and then the XY projections are dividing by 22ZoomLevel to get current screen coordinates. p  pCan anyone provide some insight as to what the problem is, and how to resolve itp  pThe same thing happens if I invoke the MapView using Cloudmade small tiles, which allows zooms up until level 20 and is a builtin osmDroid tile provider class.p  precode    mMapTileProvider  new HighResMapTileProviderthis     mMapTileProvider  new MapTileProviderBasicthis,TileSourceFactory.CLOUDMADESMALLTILES     mMapView  new MapViewthis, 256, mResourceProxy,mMapTileProvider codepre  pSo the problem does not appear to be with the tile source or provider but with the canvas drawing method.

Negative 1065 pI have an Outlook Addin written in C, MyAddin.dll, that has a configuration file MyAddin.dll.config.  Both are stored in the same directory.  They are placed there and installed by an installer.  On most installations, there is no problem with finding and reading the config file.  But, on a few installations exact same version, install, etc., the .config is never opened.p  pThe config file contents looks like this...p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt ltconfigurationgt     ltconfigSectionsgt       ...     ltconfigSectionsgt     ltsystem.diagnosticsgt       ltswitchesgt         ltadd nameMySwitch value4 gt       ltswitchesgt     ltsystem.diagnosticsgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pI implicitly load this config file with a call in my addin in one of my classes...p  precodeinternal static TraceSwitch myTraceSwitch       new TraceSwitchMySwitch, My Trace Level Switch codepre  pLike I said, this works on many installations, but not on a few.  I have run PROCMON to watch for the file events on the config file.  On systems where the file loads, PROCMON shows it in the trace.  On systems where it does not load, PROCMON shows no mention of the config file.p  pWhy would my C compiled application extension DLL correctly load in one instance, but wont even try to load the config file in another  Or, could you please provide suggestions for diagnosing this  where to look, etc.p  pMore info  The Addin is compiled Any CPU, it is installed on Windows 7 x64.  The 32bit version of Office 2010 Outlook is installed.  All of these parameters are true for both the working versions and the one that does not open the config file.p  pMore info2212012  The addin is built in the release mode.  Under VS2008 Project PropertiesBuild, the Define TRACE constant is checked.  The solution targets the .NET 3.5 Framework.  The behavior appears to be that the System.Diagnostics.TraceSwitch implementation on the machines where this fails is different than on other machines.  Ive used process explorer to compare a failing machine to a working one, and the difference is mainly that the failing machine has mostly precompiled assemblies while the work one does not.  Should that matterp

Negative 1065 pI wanted to ask a quick question just to make sure I am not missing anything simple before I  implement a more difficult method.  I need to create a custom keyboard for an iPhone application.  This I have already done by creating a view with the buttons, using a custom input view and it displays exactly like it should.  Now most of the buttons are standard numbers which need to update a UITextField in the screen that called the keyboard.  Does anyone know a simple way to do this  I assume there has to be a built in function that the keyboard uses to send the information but I havent been able to find any reference to it.  Otherwise I will have to go the more difficult route.  If anyone has a simple way to do this I would appreciate it.  I havent worked with custom keyboards before.p

Negative 1065 pHeres an SQL Server  ADO.Net Entity Framework question Im looking for the best way to do this.p  pI have a hierarchical structure of objects similar to the followingp  precodeCompany gt Division gt Department gt Group gt Specialty codepre  pThe primary key of each other than Company consists of a foreign key pointing to the PK of each of its ancestors.  So, Specialty looks like thisp  precode[PKFK] CompanyID string [PKFK] DivisionID int [PKFK] DepartmentID int [PKFK] GroupID int [PK]    SpecialtyID int         Name string         Description string codepre  pThis basic structure has to remain in place for reasons I wont go into  so using a GUID as the PK really isnt in the cards  we have to interface with other apps that rely on the Bergdorf.6.3.4.1 ID construct that this structure reflects.p  pWhat I need to do now, though, is add the ability to add a Specialty which applies to an entire Department, rather than to a group.  So, in an ideal world, wed have thisp  precode[PKFK] CompanyID string [PKFK] DivisionID int [PKFK] DepartmentID int [PKFK] GroupID intNULL [PK]    SpecialtyID int         Name string         Description string codepre  p...such that if the Specialtys GroupID is null, that means it applies to the whole department.p  pBut, of course, you cant have a nullable field as part of a PK.  So thats a nogo.p  pIt also wont work to just pull GroupID out of the PK, because then SpecialtyID is going to have to be unique across an entire Department, and we already have established IDs that make that impossible.p  pCant make a special GroupID e.g. 1 that means No Group, because the FK constraints would require us to create a Group with an ID of 1 for every single Department.p  p...So... whats the right thing to do here  Do I have to make a GUID for Specialty, and pull all those FKs out of the PK  Would really like to avoid that if possible.p  pAny ideas would be much appreciatedp

Negative 1065 pI have a stored procedure where i am selcting 10 cols based on a condition. Nothing fancy just codeSELECT col 1  10 WHERE date is between x and ycode.

Is what I am attempting to so way off the mark it seems like a simple enough concept, I am just not sure how to make it work. p  pMy other thought was to perhaps create a udf that handled the computation and call that function from inside the sproc if the bit switch was 1 and an alternate function if not.

Negative 1065 pIm thinking of learning hadoop but not sure if itll solve my problem.  Basically I have a job with a queue and a bunch of workers.  Each worker does a small amount of work and then either saves the resultsif successful or sends it back to the queue for further processing.  My problem is scalable, is limited by the bandwidth on the networkec2 which will never keep up with multiple cpus crunching the data.  I thought maybe I could run my jobs in Java in a hadoop cluster and have hadoop distribute the work via a queue.  Would this be a better approach I am correct in assuming hadoop can a queue and try to run jobs as locally as possible to minimize bandwidth usage and maximize cpu usage My program is very cpu bound but most of my recent problems with its performence are related to passing work over a networkI want to keep the work as local as possible, but the difference between the hadoop tutorials I see and my problem is that in the tutorials all the work is known in advance while my program is generating new work for its self constantlyuntil its finally done.  Would this work and would it help me reduce the impact of passing messages over a network p  pSorry Im new to hadoop and wanted to know if it could solve my problem.p

Negative 1065 pI was brought in on a legacy codebase to upgrade it from Rails 2.4Ruby 1.8.7 to Rails 3.1Ruby 1.9.2. While doing this, I found a very interesting problem that took 3 days to try to figure out.

So I figured it was something lazy loading.p  pSwitch to production mode, and the exception happens on the first request.

Negative 1065 pI am having a user draw a line on the screen, there is a start point and a end point. If the user extends over a certain angle I change the position of the endpoint so the user cannot extend beyond the specified angle.

This can be seen by when I draw the line, once i get to a certain angle, the line jumps and locks at the MAX ANGLE, but there shouldnt be any jump, it should be smooth, like the line ran into a invisible barrier.

Negative 1065 pI have multiple cells selected in a UITableView, but they automatically get deselected after editing. I searched a bit and I saw people saying that they called reloadData which has caused the selections to be removed, but I do not call reloadData anywhere except for in viewDidAppear. They get deselected even if the editing has been cancelled without changing anything when clicking edit button in the toolbar then clicking done button without any editing. Im not sure where this is happening. Or, if I could detect when the editing has been finished when done button has been clicked, I could simply reselect all the cells that had been selected, but Im not sure how I could detect it.. How could I prevent the cells from getting deselected Or reselect the cells after the editp  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 1065 pI have a project that I refactored for iOS 5 and ARC. It builds and runs fine, Analyzer finds nothing and Im on the brink of submitting it to the App store. Before doing that, I thought it would be a good idea to check for leaks, just in case I missed something during the arcification. However when I choose Product  Profile from the XCode 4.5 menu I get a flood of warnings and errors. All of them indicate that the build for profiling is not recognizing that the project is using ARC. The scheme settings for profile are set to use the same arguments and environment variables as run, but run works and profile doesnt. If I choose the Profile without building action, everything works. Ive checked to make sure that there is only one version of XCode installed, checked the path, and its all good. This is not a show stopper, but Id like to know whats happening, and what setting to tweak if thats all it is. p
Negative 1065 pId like to ask for some help regarding the sampling rate and jitter on the magnetometer. Im working on a project with some people that involves a high rate magnetic field sampling application. Even though we have developed an algorithm to workaround the jitter and other issues we encountered, wed like to improve the sampling rating somehow and, at the same time, if possible, attempt to reduce the sampling jitter. Improving the sampling rate would allow us to achieve better results for our application. We are using a Samsung Nexus S and according to the tests we performed we observed that the sampling rates between 15ms and 20ms and, sometimes, peaks around 50 ms this is between consecutive events.p  pWe have come with different approaches to try to develop a solution to these issues, however without any success so far. Firstly, we thought of modifying the current magnetometer AK8973 device driver but we soon realized that the bottleneck couldnt the there as the device driver directly implements the correct sensor operation modes, data reading and respects the sensor hardware timing constraints. As a second alternative, we developed a small code using Android NDK to obtain samples to compare the times obtained between consecutive events, i.e. between samples, with the code developed at the Java level. Sadly, the result was pretty much the same. As a final alternative, we are currently trying to understand how the events are handled by the API and passed to Java. That said, if the bottleneck is there wed try to change the code to solve the issues. However, we are not sure if the bottleneck is in the underlying hardware or software API.p  pThe code we used for NDK is based on the example provided by the Android documentation NativeActivity and some other examples we came across with by googling google groups and other articles. The articles we found are quite interesting a hrefhttpwww.sensorplatforms.comnativesampling relnofollowNative Samplinga, a hrefhttpwww.sensorplatforms.comsmartphoneperformancefundamentalssensorsampling relnofollowSensor Sampling Performancea. Even though it is reported that native sampling allows for better performance, in our case it seems not to happen.p  pWed like to know if it is actually possible to obtain a higher sampling rate at all or if anyone has already developed a solution. Is the bottleneck at the software or hardware level In the articles referenced above, it is mentioned that a custom library FreeMotion is able to deliver better performance results, as a replace to the original sensor library, because it works with the drivers directly. Has anyone used this library before and, if yes, could you provide us your resultsp

Negative 1065 pI have a character device driver which is causing a system deadlock on a multicore system. The write call has a critical section  protected by a spin lock spinlockirqsave. The ISR must obtain this lock to finish its task as well.

The write process never returns to finish executing. Shouldnt the write process continue to execute on its core, release the lock which will allow the other core in its ISR to then runp  pThe critical section requires about 5us to complete.

Negative 1065 pI am currently facing the following issue and I would appreciate if someone could help me out here. I am pretty new to JSF...p  pI have a JSF application with the following architecture The main index.html site contains a Javascript that opens an XMLHttpRequest to a servlet with the user screen resolution parameters. The servlet receives the request, extracts the screen resoultuion parameters and sends it to a session bean objectp  precodeString wth  request.getParameterwidth String hgt  request.getParameterheigh HttpSession session  request.getSessiontrue Object o  session.getAttributemainSessionBean MainSessionBean mainSessionBean  MainSessionBean o mainSessionBean.setScreenWidthwth mainSessionBean.setScreenHeighthgt codepre  pNow this works on its own way, the problem is that at the very first page index.html the session bean object does not have the parameter yet should we navigate to another site the session bean does have the parameter. I believe this means that the index.html gets renderedcreated before the session bean object gets created. Should we navigate to another site the session bean object does have the necessary screen size values. So, where I am now is that I can set up the JSF elements dynamically according to the users screen resolution but only from the second visited page onwards.p  pWhat I would like to achieve is that the Javascript initiates its XMLHttpRequest to the servlet, the servlet then calls the session bean, passes the necesary screen size resolution and when the first page gets created then the necessary parameters are already in place. p  pI am not entirely sure I am doing this on the right way, but any advice, link to the right sort of resource will be appreciated.p

Also, the codeCustomTaskcode class codesetDatarefcode method indeed is passed a Reference named codesomeidcode, so it all goes wrong in the codesetDatarefcode method, but I have no clue what I have to do and the manual is lacking or I am missing an important part.p  pI have the feeling I dont completely grasp the lifecycle of custom datatypes with ids.p  pstrongEDIT 23112012 924 strongp  pAfter some more fiddling and looking in the source of codeorg.apache.tools.ant.types.Pathcode I followed some of the methods there and changed my SampleData.getData to the followingp  precodepublic String getData      ifisReference          return SampleDatagetCheckedRef.getData          return this.data  codepre  pI am a little bit further, however now I get the following Ant error in my codebuild.xmlcode p  precode homearjandevsodemobuild.xml9 someid doesnt denote a SampleData codepre  pHowever when I check the class encapsulated by the Reference object it is the correct type.

Negative 1065 pAt the beginning I would like to describe my current position and the goal that would like to achieve.p  pI am a researcher dealing with machine learning. So far have gone through several theoretical courses covering machine learning algorithms and social network analysis and therefore have gained some theoretical concepts useful for implementing machine learning algorithms and feed in the real data.p  pOn simple examples the algorithms work well and the running time is acceptable whereas the big data represent a problem if trying to run algoritghms on my PC. Regarding the software I have enough experiences to implement whatever algorithm from articles or design my own using whatever language or IDE so far have used Matlab, Java with Eclipse, .NET... but so far havent got much experiences with settingup infrastructure. I have started to learn about Hadoop, NoSQL databases etc., but am not sure what strategy would be the best taking into consideration the learning time constraints.p  pstrongThe final goal is to be able to setup a working platform for analyzing big data with focusing on implementing my own machine learning algorithms and put all together into production, ready for solving useful question by processing big data.strongp  pAs the main focus is on implementing machine learning algorithms I would like to ask whether there is any existing running platform, offering enough CPU resources to feed in large data, upload own algorithms and simply process the data without thinking about distributed processing.p  pNevertheless such platform exists or not, I would like to gain a picture big enough to be able to work in a team which could put into production the whole system tailored upon the specific customer demands. For example a retailor would like to analyze daily purchases so all the daily records have to be uploaded to some infrastructure, capable enough to process the data by using custom machine learning algorithms.p  pTo put all the above into simple question strongHow to design a custom data mining solution for real life problems with main focus on machine learning algorithms and put it into production, if possible, by using the existing infrastructure and if not, design distributed system by using Hadoop or whatever framework.strongp  pI would be very thankful for any advice or suggestions about books or other helpful resources.p

Negative 1065 pIm having trouble understand this. Ajax is asynchronous, that much is certain...it asynchronously calls on PHP, and that PHP has a sql query for the database. That means that PHP sql query is also done asynchronously, right Otherwise, it defeats the purpose. But without using Ajax, the PHP sql query would be synchronous, is that it I know how to put it to code, but Im just confused on how it works internally.p
Negative 1065 pOkay, Im having a large amount of difficulty solving a particular issue. The transfer of an object through the service.  Conceptually, it makes sense...

Negative 1065 pI have a scss file, and I compile it into a css file using scss. The scss to css compiler detects the errors in the scss file, but it seems too tolerant. That is, even when I mistype the name of the style attributes, it compiles without an error. Is there a way to make it return an error when there is a style attribute in the scss file that does not exist in css3 or in the imported features There is also a possibility of writing an invalid value for the styles, but I know that is more complicated, and is not asking for that.p
Negative 1065 pMy setup is the following. I have an Activity with 3 Fragments in a ViewPager. The first and the last Fragment are inflated via xml whereas the center Fragment is a Class derived directly from SurfaceView. This Class has its own rendering thread.p  pThe Project uses ActionBarSherlock 4.0.2 and also the Support Library V4.p  pstrongProblemstrong When the SurfaceView is shown and I swipe to one of the other Fragments these Fragments are not rendered during the transition. IOW instead of scrolling in the other Fragments the SurcaceView leaves behind previous rendered artefacts smear. Once the transition is completed the target Fragment is shown though. Swiping from one of the outer Fragments to the SurfaceView in the center works as expected.p  pstrongPossibly related problemstrong When using the tabs in the ActionBar to perform the transition instead of swiping the target Fragments are not rendered at all. Although nothing is rendered the controls are active. Eg pressing the invisible buttons causes the assigned actions. This causes a refresh making the view visible.p  pinstead of posting the source code I put it all on a hrefhttpsgithub.comQbertMFQTile relnofollowGitHubap  pI have tried a lot to find the root cause of the behaviour but to no avail.p  ul lipUsing another non SurfaceView Fragment in the middle works fine.pli lipWrapping the SurfaceView in a LinearLayout View did not make a difference.pli lipSwitching off the Threadand all custom drawing inside the SurfaceView had no effect.pli ul  pAny ideas, suggestions and ideas are welcome.p

Ive installed JDK from Oracle, 1.6.037, every execution of my hello world application fails withp  pcode java cp libhelloworld.jar. Djava.library.path. HelloWorldcodep  pcodeld.so.1 java fatal JavajavautiljarJarFilegetMetaInfEntryNames cant find symbolcodep  pIve tried different JDKs thinking that this is some distribution problem. The same missing symbols errors I got with JDK code1.6.023code and code1.7.010code.p  pI did quick grep on all symbols in all .so libraries that JDK comes with and found that this symbols is defined in codejrei386libzip.socode. Then I have run java with codeLDPRELOADJAVAHOMEjrei386libzip.so LDLIBRARYPATH...code and this time got segmentation fault. I need to mention that I have tested this hello world application under Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 and it works without a problem.p  pProbably this is problem is stricly bound to Solaris  JDK tandem. As Im not so familiar with Java runtime Ive no other ideas how to debug this problem. Any hintsp

Negative 1065 pSo, Im converting a flash widget into HTMLCSSJS and Im having problems emulating a centeroriented zooming effect for images.p  pSo, currently I have a structure in HTML like thisp  precodeltdiv idoutergt   ltimg gt ltdivgt codepre  pWith CSS similar to the followingp  precodeouter   width 690px   height 440px   position relative  outer img   width 690px   height 440px   position absolute   top 0px   left 0px  codepre  pThen in jQuery, Im doing this to create the zoom effectp  precodeimage  outer img scale  1.16 var w  parseIntimage.datawidth Set earlier to 690px var h  parseIntimage.dataheight Set earlier to 440px image   .animate     width wscale,     height hscale,     left wscale  w2,     top hscale  h2   , 5000, linear codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netDusRy1 relnofollowjFiddle hereap  pIts a little hard to see with this specific image that I found but its for one reason or another more easily seen in the images my client gave me. What Im seeing is a jaggedshakyjittery movement which I assume might be because decimal values for lefttopwidthheight not lining up well enough to keep it centered always.p  pIs there a better way to go about this or maybe an easing function that will produce a better resultp  pIf theres anything I can clear up, let me know.p  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong Ive begun to think maybe if I could write an easing function that would increase the widthheight by 2 every time the lefttop decreases by 1 to make it stay center all the time, but Im not sure how to go about that in jQuery. I tried messing around with the codestepcode argument of the codeanimatecode function but I cant figure out how to force the lefttop properties to increasedecrease by integer values whole numbers only...p

Negative 1065 h1Backgroundh1  pIve been searching for a while for a layout which has 960px width and two columnsp  ul liMain content aligned right, width of 550px, inset from right margin of containerli liSidebar aligned left, width of 250px, flush with container on top, left and bottom edgesli ul  pThe bit which I have been struggling with is setting the backgrounds such that the sidebar background takes up 250px width, 100 height of parent and is flush with left edge of parent leaving the main content to take up the remaining width and 100 height of parent.p  pI have looked at a few techniques, but they seemed to be relatively inflexible, e.g. though it is elegant, Faux Columns doesnt quite seem proper a hrefhttpwww.alistapart.comarticlesfauxcolumns relnofollowhttpwww.alistapart.comarticlesfauxcolumnsa.p  pThinking about it a bit, I decided to try splitting up the rendering of the content from the rendering of the backgrounds. Specifically, I have main content floated right and sidebar floated left, then a codeclearbothcode so that the container will adjust to the larger of the two columns.p  pNext, whilst still inside the container but after the codeclearbothcode, I have two empty divs which are absolutely positioned, heights of 100 and width of 250px for sidebar with codeleft0code, then width of 100 for main content.

I know I could jump into learning OpenGL or DirectX but I want to know what other options exists for drawing graphics, and how well they scale against OpenGL performance wise.

Also, how come I have to redeclare all the variables even though I use super in the constructor Car Arent the variables initiated in Vehicle Also, since I must redeclare all the variables from Vehicle, are all the public methods I inherit from Vehicle, completely useless Whats the point of inheriting from a class that only has package access right variablesp

Negative 1065 pI am building a Java backend component that processes a moderate volume of data every day. We have a POJO, lets call it codeWidgetcode, that has about 10 properties on it. My software must process groups of codeWidgetcode lists essentially there are other processes completely different systems that put together their own codeListltWidgetgtcode, and then send them to my software. My software actually receives a wrapper POJO that looks like thisp  precodepublic class Payload      private ListltWidgetgt widgets  lt what I want     private String guid  GUID my software doesnt need this     private boolean fizz  again, my software doesnt need this     ... many other properties that I dont care about  codepre  pMy software aggregates all these codeListltWidgetgtcode, each created by different systems, and then process them together in one big batch.p  pI have tentatively chose codeArrayListltArrayListltWidgetgtgtcode as the data structure for holding this batch of codeWidgetcode lists. There will be about 500,000 groups of codeListltWidgetgtcode the outer codeArrayListcode, and each codeListltWidgetgtcode will have about 5 codeWidgetcodes each for a grand total of 2.5 million codeWidgetcodes in the inner codeArrayListcode.p  pAt a recent code review, some tech leads told me I had chosen the wrong data structure for this batch o widgets. They told me I should have used codeHashMapltString,ListltWidgetgtgtcode, because its more efficient and easier to work with. The hashmap key is a GUID contained in the codePayloadcode that my software is given. Not that I need the GUID for any reason, it just serves as a key to keep the 500,000 codeListltWidgetgtcode separate  which I do need to do.p  pThis got me thinking whos right The only operations were doing on this data structure are adds in the case of codeArrayListcode, just adding a codeWidgetcode or a codeListltWidgetgtcode via codeadd...code and then reads inside my software I have to iterate through every codeWidgetcode and inspect it for stuff. With my nested codeArrayListcode the gist of it isp  precodeforListltWidgetgt widgetList  myDoublyNestedArrayOfWidgets      forWidget widget  widgetList          ...       codepre  pThese are the only operations we need add the disparate codeListltWidgetgtcodes to some big batch data structure, and then at a later time, inspect all of them and do stuff with each codeWidgetcode.

The closest I got was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3435370strippinghexbyteswithsednomatchthis QampAa but I could not reproduce their results on my machine OSX 10.7.5, using codebashcode.p  pHere is the issue reduced to its essence I cant get codesedcode to interpret codexnncode e.g. codex41code for codeAcode as hex characters. Whats driving me nuts in particular is thisp  precodeecho e x41  codepre  presults in codeAcode  so the OS and its functions understand my hex code...p  precodeecho e x41  sed sAB codepre  presults in codeBcode  as expected, since the hex code was converted to codeAcode before codesedcode saw itp  pButp  precodeecho A  sed sx41B codepre  presults in codeAcode  I would have expected codeBcodep  pI have tried things likep  precodeecho A  LANGC sed sx41B codepre  presults in codeAcodep  precodeecho A  LANG sed sx41B codepre  pditto...p  precodeecho A  sed s[x41]B codepre  presults in codeAcodep  pBUT...p  precodeecho A  sed s[x41x41]B codepre  presults in codeBcode p  pAm I being completely stupid Or is there really something strange with codesedcode It can apparently interpret the hex code in a range, but I cant get it to be interpreted as a single character. What am I missingp  pPlease note  I am looking for answers that both explain why the above is behaving the way it is, and for ways to make it possible to insert a emsingle hex codeem anywhere in a codesedcode string, emon the OSX platformem. This means both in the search, and in the replace part of the codescode command.  Because I have obviously shown I can search for a single character with [xnnxnn] thats not the answer I am looking for.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1065 pHow secure would it be to have a external machine create hashes for passwords.

I can get the gateway of every IP address in the list but I need the default gateway IP address.p  pThe original reason for wanting this was to select the specific MAC address from the bunch of MAC addresses of the IP which has got the default gateway.  As we get multiple MAC addresses while iterating thru the list, we thought the best way is pick up the MAC address of the IP which has the default gateway.  We have since changed our minds, and will choose the wired connection MAC address.  But I am still curious to know how to get the default gateway instead of iterating thru all the adapters.p

Negative 1065 pI did some browsing and could not find an answered question that addresses this issue.p  pMy winform consists of a filldocked flow control with a bunch of other controls in it. More controls leave and are added during runtime, so I have the flowcontrol and the winform autosize to fit everything as it appears. p  pThe issue is, I want scrollbars to appear once the form exceeds a certain size. So if the form is small, it continues to autosize to fit, but once it gets about a certain height, the internal flowcontrol keeps doing its thing but the form stops growing and a scroll bar appears.p  pIs there a way to do this All combinations of dock, autoscroll, and autosize that I tried were fruitless, but maybe I was doing it wrong.p  pJust a quick note  currently, once the flowcontrol grows to be taller than the screen, it moves everything below that line over to a new column. I would also like to disable this, so that it continues to grow vertically regardless of screen height because I will have scroll bars.p

Negative 1065 pI have to display String in some component like TextBox,TextFile in JavaFX. This String can contain control,non printable characters i.e all characters in ASCII lt 32. When I display my string on console by println then control characters are replacing by space only in the view because I can copy and past the same string still with control characters.By default non printable characters are skiped for displaying.

Negative 1065 pI have an app that uses an codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to grab various results from a database and display them in a codeUITableViewCellcode. For artistic reasons, at all times I want alternating cells to be left and right oriented, much like a conversation in codeMessagescode.p  pIm currently achieving this by using an codeintegercode called codeentryIndexPathcode, which is incremented and then used in an codeifcode statement inside codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode to determine whether the cell should be left or right aligned based on whether that integer is odd or even.p  pMy problem is that when scrolling back up the table, this leftright assignment can get confused, and a cell that has just scrolled off can be reassigned when reappearing from the top, since codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode is being called, the counter is being incremented.p  pI need a surefire way to ensure that when a new set of results is gotten from the FRC, that the leftright values are assigned correctly and firmly. I know that I need to do this outside of codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode, but Im struggling to see where I strongshouldstrong do it. Any ideas, or suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrong Id also point out that my managed objects dont currently have a LeftRight variable or anything like that, so creating one would be pretty awkward, recreating lots and lots of data, etc. If there a means of doing it without that, thatd be ideal.p

Negative 1065 pIm trying to create a generic InputVerifier that checks to see if the data in the JComponent is within a specified range. For this, I made my generic type extend Comparablelt to ensure it could be compared.p  pWhat Im getting caught up on is the following two thingsp  ol liJComponent doesnt have a getText method, and there isnt a subclass to cast to thats used by common components like JTextField and JSpinner, which each have their different methods for getting values.li liI dont think I can specify that my generic type DataType must have a certain function signature. I was trying to see if I could enforce that it has a a constructor that takes in a single string like Integer, Double, Float do, or to enforce that DataType must extend either Integer, Double, or Float, but I am not sure if this is possible with Java 7 Generics. It would be great if i could do something like codeDataType myData  new DataTypetextcodeli ol  pHere is the class I have now. I made it abstract, so a subclass would have to know the type of JComponent involved to return the text, and then how to build up the comparable type for comparison. This can lead to many permutations given the different types of JComponents and Comparable types that could be in play. Is there a way to eliminate one or both of the issues Iv mentioned abovep  precodeimport javax.swing.InputVerifier import javax.swing.JComponent  public abstract class InputRangeVerifierltDataType extends ComparableltDataTypegtgt extends InputVerifier       private DataType mmin     private DataType mmax      public InputRangeVerifierDataType min, DataType max          mmin  min         mmax  max           Override     public boolean verifyJComponent component          String componentText  getComponentText         DataType comparable  getComparableValuecomponentText          boolean greaterThanOrEqualToMin  comparable.compareTommin gt 0         boolean lessThanOrEqualToMax  comparable.compareTommax lt 0         boolean isInRange  greaterThanOrEqualToMin ampamp lessThanOrEqualToMax          return isInRange           public abstract String getComponentText     public abstract DataType getComparableValueString text   codepre

Negative 1065 pI have been following Stripes tutorial for creating my own form with their API. Long story short, what happens is, when the form is submitted, a bit of Javascript sends the data to their servers and then appends the codestripeTokencode input field. The form is then submitted again, and my Flask app is supposed to read the value of this new form field. However, when I try running my code, it yields a 500 Internal Server Error, which I assume is because Flask is immediately looking for the form codestripeTokencode, which does not exist when it first checks.

Negative 1065 pWhen using a hrefhttpjames.newtonking.compagesjsonnet.aspx relnofollowJson.NETa to deserialize a JSON string into an object, how do I require a keyproperty to be present in the JSON stirng, but allow for NULL valuesp  pFor examplep  pLets say I have a classobject...p  precode[DataContract] public class Car      [DataMemberIsRequired  true]     public string Vin get set      [DataMemberIsRequired  true]     public string Color get set      public string Description get set  codepre  pIn the above example, the VIN and Color are required, and an exception would be thrown if either one of them is missing from the JSON string.

Negative 1065 pI am creating an installer for an application that is broken into two parts. The first part is an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWindowsInstaller relnofollowMSIa file that is installed on a server. It includes all of the product executables and data files as well as the installer for the client application. This was easily created using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWiX relnofollowWiXa v3.7. The client installer to be run from network workstations simply needs to install a prerequisite component on the workstation and then create shortcuts to the applications on the network drive.

Negative 1065 pThis has bothered me for a while. A lot of times I find myself making a large buffer to hold a maximum amount of data.

However, the lengths may be different for the next iteration. Ie. they could be codexlength  4code and codeylength  4code given codeamountOfData  16code.p  pI want to do some kind of casting that allows me cast the 1D array using 2D array indexing. I know how long my initial 1D length is, which tells me how long my 2D codexlengthcode and codeylengthcode are, so this should be easy to do without using codenewcode or codemalloccode as long as the initial 100 bytes is long enough to hold any useful data set to me.p  pI realize thatp  precodechar data2d  char data1D codepre  pwill not work because the compiler doesnt know the size of the second dimension.

Negative 1065 pIm an undergrad college student attempting to understand Inheritance in Java. The docs.oracle site says all members of a class are inherited, with the exception of constructors. Which makes sense. Problem is I did an experiment and it didnt work. Here it isp  precodepublic class One     public void outPrint         System.out.printlnHello World     end outPrint end One.java  public class Two extends One     empty end Two.java  public class Three extends Two     public static void mainString[]args         outPrint     end main end Three.java codepre  pWhen I run Three I get nonstatic method outPrint cannot be referenced from a static context. This is of course because the compiler is seeing outPrint as an instance member. If I add the keyword static to the outPrint method header the whole thing works just fine.p  pThis is where my confusion lies. It seems it not just constructors that are not inheritable, but also all of its instance members.  Could anyone explain this a little better to me  Is there a work around that does not involve the use of static I tried a few experiments with super to no avail. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1065 pIn a JAXRS BookShop I want to filter customer recensions for xss content. For a JSF application I do this by applying a filter in web.xml which checks the value of the attached parameter for xss content. Since JAXRS webservices are receiving serialized obejects instead of parameter values it would be much easier to validate the content within the recension bean itself.  Hence, I am of the opinion that there is no reason to apply a xxs filter within a JAXRS services.  Am I rightp

Negative 1065 pIm creating an Android app with a Sqlite DB that has a couple of tables with prepopulated data 500 rows and also has tables which will be user populated.p  pThe way I plan on distributing the database is via the following method for adding a prepopulated database to an app a hrefhttpwww.reigndesign.comblogusingyourownsqlitedatabaseinandroidapplications relnofollowUsing your own SQLite database in Android applicationsa.p  pI have an issue with this however as when it comes to upgrades I will likely either be adding a number of rows to the prepopulated tables and possibly even modifying a lot of the data in the existing rows, I want to completely replace those existing tables with the tables from the new prepopulated tables, yet leave the user populated tables intact.p  pI found another post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma96588941172181How do i upgrade my prepopulated sqlite database on my device without recreating tablesa where a user suggests this may be the wrong approach entirely The right way to do things is quite different from how youve set out as I want upgrades to be as efficient as possible.

Negative 1065 pThere is a multithreaded application executing some PLpgsql function. That function produces record inserts to a critically important resource table . Also it executes some selectupdateetc operations while executing.p  pThe issue is, sometimes we face duplicate 23  records each one passed to the function in a parallel thread. And they all are inserted into table as a function execution result, while they should not.p  pIt happens, because both transactions are executed in parallel, and have no idea that the same record is being prepared to insert in a parallel transaction.p  pThe table is critically important and all kinds of codeLOCK TABLEcode are extremely not welcomed codeLOCK FOR SHARE MODEcode meanwhile gave as some useful experience.p  pSo, the question is, is there any best practice how to organize PLpgsql function working with a critical resource table to be executed by multithreaded app and producing no harmful locks on this resourcep  pPS. I know, that some thread partinioning by record.ID in the app is a possible solution. But I.m interested in a PLpgsql solution first of all.p
Negative 1065 pWell I am doing a little game app of drag and drop to a target. I have 4 objects named on the dropArray, 4 targets named on the hitArray, and 4 audio files that correspond to the objects array named on the soundArray.p  pThe 4 audio files should start syncronized at the same time but with the volume turned down, so when an object hits the target it turns up a volume of the corresponding audio file.p  pThe objects are snapping to the targets correctly. I figured out how to start all the audio files at the same time maybe it is not the best way. p  pThe goal of the app is that the 4 audio files correspond to each instrument of the song. When you drop let say dragJuan to dragJuant the voz.mp3 must starts to sound. The audio files are Vocal, guitar, bass and drum. So when the 4 audio files play together a song is completed and this should happen when the 4 object are in their target.p  pThis app is on one frame of the Flash CS6 file. I have a total od 8 frames with different pages of the presentation and only the second frame contains this app. p  pstrongPROBLEMSstrongp  p1 When an object hits the target all the audio files are turned up and turned down when it is out of its target . And I just need that each object turns up its correponding audio file, and when it is out of its target the volume turns down again.p  p2 When I click on a button to go to whatever frame I want, lets say the 4th frame of the project, the dropArray object that has been clicked remains on the stage dragging and dropping as it where on the its frame.

Negative 1065 pIm trying to use the new EffectFactoryEffect to add effects to images off screen i.e. framebuffer. Ive looked at the a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavaextcom.google.androidandroidapps4.1.1r1comexampleandroidmediafxHelloEffects.java relnofollowHelloEffects.java examplea provided in the SDK and Ive tried it out and it works. Except it obviously uses a GLSurfaceView and that isnt what I want.p  pSo Ive taken a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformctsjbmr2releaseteststestseffectsrcandroideffectctsGLEnv.java relnofollowtestseffectsrcandroideffectctsGLEnv.javaa to setup the EGL stuff and Ive also grabbed TextureRenderer.java and GLToolbox from the HelloEffects example. Mashed them all up and Ive got the code below.p  pemOn a side note, I have also tried  testsmediasrcandroidmediactsOutputSurface.java to setup the EGL stuff and I got the exact same result.emp  pWhen I run it, the image I get back is just uniformly blue. This corresponds to the glClear I did with the colour blue. This proves at least to some degree that pixels are being rendered to the framebuffer, glReadPixels is seeing those pixels and the bitmap output is working.p  pBut why is the texture not showing up Neither the original nor the effectapplied texture shows up. No GL errors are detected either.p  pIve trimmed down the code to a single file working example that can be copiedpasted into Eclipse and will run.

However the accesstoken is for the user owning the page and thus it will go to their news feed and not the page in this case their company page.

Negative 1065 pIm working with lists that could have ambiguous values in certain places. The lists are small enough that implementing backtracking search seems silly. Currently, Im representing ambiguous values in my lists with sublists containing possible values. For instance, the list p  precode[1, 2, [3,4]] codepre  pCould be either the list code[1,2,3]code or code[1,2,4]code.

Negative 1065 pI am new to WinRT and XAML and have even less experience with animations.

What I really need to to change an entire set of bezier path points with each frame to produce an entirely new sine type wave with random amplitudes and control points. Each amplitudes height would be random to approximate a sound wave at a given point in time and the animation is the changing sound patterns over time.

I need to animate changing all the bezier points with each frame. Can I use a storyboard here or do I just need to draw a canvas on some kind of timerp

Negative 1065 pI would like to get a similar result top  precodeclass MyClassdb.Model     fielddb.IntegerProperty codepre  pi.e., the object of this class should have codefieldcode on a list of its propertiesp  precodeoMyClass o.properties codepre  pHowever, these fields should be created dynamically based on the definition of their names and types, as in the example belowp  precodeclass MyClassdb.Model     def initself,args,kwargs         defsfieldd,otherfields d for integer, s for string         for key in defs             typeofdefs[key]             valdb.StringProperty if typeofs else db.IntegerProperty             tried these lines below... but properties are still empty              setattrself, key, val             setattrself.class, key, val             setattrself.class, key, propertylambda self self.dict[key]             self.dict.updatekeyval         db.Model.initself,args,kwargs codepre  pNone of the codesetattrcode lines worked they create fields but not properties the list of properties in the object remains empty, therefore it seems that I cannot use such objects in codedb.GqlQuerycode.

Negative 1065 pI have a Java EE application which uses an external jar for logging purpose, but it needs an URL for configuration which is resolved in the jar itself with JNDI lookup.p  pSome clarification examplesp  pLoggingLib.jar      LoggingFactory.javap  precodepublic void resolveJndi      Context ctx  new InitialContext      URL myConf  ctx.lookupurlmyConf  codepre  pThis lib is included in the real app EAR file and recalled in various class of the application in web module, ejb module and even in another jar with JPA classes.p  pEverything works if jndi name urlmyConf exists but I need to map it to a personalized name specified at deploy time.

Negative 1065 pI need to pass some extra informations along with codeUIWebView loadRequestcode so that it reaches my implementation of codeNSURLProtocolcode. The information cannot be bound to codeNSURLRequestcode because the information must be retained with codeNSURLRequest mainDocumentURLcode as well. So i subclassed codeNSURLcode and constructed codeNSURLRequestcode with it. I already knew that the codeNSURLRequestcode which reaches codeNSURLProtocol startLoadingcode is NOT the instance i have fed to codeUIWebView loadRequestcode, so i implemented codeNSURL copyWithZonecode too, naively expecting that URL loading system will use it.p  pNow, codeNSURLProtocol canInitWithRequestcode is called not once as one would reasonably expect, but at least 4 times before codestartLoadingcode. First 2 times of that, the incoming codeNSURLRequestcode still contains my custom codeNSURLcode implementation. Then an unfortunate internal code called codeCFURLCopyAbsoluteURLcode asks for the codeabsoluteURLcode of my custom codeNSURLcode and the next codecanInitWithRequestcode and subsequent codestartLoadingcode already gets a completely new codeNSURLRequestcode with fresh codeNSURLcode in it. codecopyWithZonecode is never called and my subclassed codeNSURLcode is lost.p  pBefore i give up and implement an inferior and fragile solution with attaching stuff directly to the URL string, i would like to ask the wizards of higher level, whether they see a way how to catch that initial blink on the codeNSURLProtocolcode radar or how to trick codeCFURLCopyAbsoluteURLcode into carrying my custom instance. I have tried to hack codeNSURL absoluteURLcode by returning again a new instance of my custom NSURL class, but it didnt help. I have seen some promise in a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationcocoareferencefoundationclassesNSURLProtocolClassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccclmNSURLProtocolsetProperty3aforKey3ainRequest3a relnofollowcodeNSURLProtocol setPropertycodea functionality, but now it appears pretty useless. URL loading system creates new instances of everything happily and codeNSURLRequestcode arrived in codeNSURLProtocolcode seems to be the same as the one entered into codeUIWebViewcode only accidentally.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong ok i wanted to keep the post as short as possible, but the even the first reply is asking for technical background, so here we go ive got multiple codeUIWebViewcodes in app. These views may run requests concurrently and absolutely can run requests for the same URL. Its like tabs in desktop browser. But i need to distinguish which codeUIWebViewcode was the origin of each particular codeNSURLRequestcode arriving to the codeNSURLProtocolcode. I need a context being carried with each URL request. I cant simply map the URLs to data, because multiple codeUIWebViewscode may be loading the same URL at any moment.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Attaching the context information to codeNSURLcode is preferred and, as far as my understanding goes, the only usable.

Using emaddress summaryem gives the following output and shows about 1.7 GB of private bytes MEMCOMMITp  precode     Usage Summary  RgnCount  Total Size  ofBusy    ofTotal ltunclassifiedgt                         2430          623a1000    1.535 Gb  82.09   76.74 Image                                  1583          13dc5000  317.770 Mb  16.60   15.52 Free                                    516           8583000  133.512 Mb            6.52 Stack                                   111           18a5000   24.645 Mb   1.29    1.20 TEB                                      37             25000  148.000 kb   0.01    0.01 NlsTables                                 1             23000  140.000 kb   0.01    0.01 ActivationContextData                    11             14000   80.000 kb   0.00    0.00 CsrSharedMemory                           1              5000   20.000 kb   0.00    0.00 PEB                                       1              1000    4.000 kb   0.00    0.00   Type Summary for busy  RgnCount  Total Size  ofBusy ofTotal MEMPRIVATE                            2144          58bbb000    1.386 Gb  74.16   69.32 MEMIMAGE                              1929          163bf000  355.746 Mb  18.58   17.37 MEMMAPPED                              102           8af3000  138.949 Mb   7.26    6.78   State Summary  RgnCount  Total Size  ofBusy ofTotal MEMCOMMIT                             3206          6da16000    1.713 Gb  91.62   85.65 MEMRESERVE                             969           a057000  160.340 Mb   8.38    7.83 MEMFREE                                516           8583000  133.512 Mb            6.52   Protect Summary for commit  RgnCount  Total Size  ofBusy ofTotal PAGEREADWRITE                         1605          50166000    1.251 Gb  66.93   62.57 PAGEEXECUTEREAD                       271          11e83000  286.512 Mb  14.97   13.99 PAGEREADONLY                           623           7335000  115.207 Mb   6.02    5.63 PAGEREADWRITEPAGEWRITECOMBINE          8           2710000   39.063 Mb   2.04    1.91 PAGEWRITECOPY                          328           15bf000   21.746 Mb   1.14    1.06 PAGEEXECUTEREADWRITE                  210            7ef000    7.934 Mb   0.41    0.39 PAGEEXECUTEWRITECOPY                   75            181000    1.504 Mb   0.08    0.07 PAGEREADWRITEPAGEGUARD                82             b5000  724.000 kb   0.04    0.03 ltunknowngt                                 4              4000   16.000 kb   0.00    0.00   Largest Region by Usage  Base Address  Region Size  ltunclassifiedgt                              44150000           22c0000   34.750 Mb Image                                         802000           243f000   36.246 Mb Free                                        7a740000            d80000   13.500 Mb Stack                                        6e10000             fd000 1012.000 kb TEB                                         7eed9000              1000    4.000 kb NlsTables                                   7efb0000             23000  140.000 kb ActivationContextData                          50000              4000   16.000 kb CsrSharedMemory                             7efe0000              5000   20.000 kb PEB                                         7efde000              1000    4.000 kb codepre  pUsing emeeheap gcem shows the following resultp  precodeNumber of GC Heaps 1 generation 0 starts at 0x78747eb4 generation 1 starts at 0x78741000 generation 2 starts at 0x04781000 ephemeral segment allocation context none  segment     begin allocated  size 04780000  04781000  0577fca4  0xffeca416772260 ... 78740000  78741000  78841ff4  0x100ff41052660 Large object heap starts at 0x05781000  segment     begin allocated  size 05780000  05781000  06755a58  0xfd4a5816599640 ... 52f80000  52f81000  53e07308  0xe8630815229704 Total Size              Size 0x279b9d7c 664509820 bytes.

Negative 1065 pHey Everyone so Ive been killing myself over this and this is probably the last thing I need help on to finally finish this project. p  pSo I have a timer event that puts the Movie clip in the array onto the Stage. The MovieClip is named codemSquarecode and from the timer event I add it like sop  precodeprivate function addSquareeTimerEventvoid                    mSquare  new mcSquare             stage.addChildmSquare             mSquare.x  stage.stageWidth  2             mSquare.y  stage.stageHeight  2  450             aSquareArray.pushmSquare             traceaSquareArray.length       codepre  pNow what I am trying to Accomplish is when the user clicks or has its mouse down on the object, I want that object that the user clicked to be removed from the stage. p  pNow I cant get it to function properly when the user clicks on one of the MovieClips from the array thats added to the stage. Or if I do then MovieClip that was currently clicked doesnt get destroyed but rather another instance of it on the stage gets destroyed. Its just real bad. p  pSo Here is how I have it set up so far...p  pIn my Constructorp  precode    stage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, movieClipHandler  codepre  pThen the codemovieClipHandlercode MouseEventp  precodeprivate function movieClipHandlereMouseEventvoid test               mSquare.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, squareIsBeingClicked       codepre  pThen in the codesquareIsBeingClickedcode Functionp  precodeprivate function squareIsBeingClickedeMouseEventvoid                 var squareDisplayObject  e.target as DisplayObject  clicked square          var iint  aSquareArray.indexOfsquare  index in the array           if i lt 0   THIS IS WHERE I GET CONFUSED                        the MC is out of the array                traceClicked                mouseIsDown  true                checkSquareIsClicked             else                         the MC is in the array                   codepre  pAnd finally i have a function called codecheckSquareIsClickedcode to do all the workp  precodeprivate function checkPopIsBeingClickedvoid                Loop through all pops         for var iint  0 i lt aPopArray.length i                      Get current pops in i loop             var currentpopmcPop  aPopArray[i]              if mouseIsDown                              traceCurrent Pop Destroyed                 aPopArray.splicei, 1                 currentpop.destroyPop                 nScore                  updateHighScore                 updateCurrentScore                 mouseIsDown  false                  Add Explosion Effect                 popExplode  new mcPopExplode                 stage.addChildpopExplode                 popExplode.y  currentpop.y                 popExplode.x  currentpop.x                              codepre  pI know I am doing something really wrong because it shouldnt take this much functions to initiate this array of mouse event.

Negative 1065 pMy company has developed an iOS application for an external client. They have done some initial testing with us distributing the app via our testflight account.

I havae left comments explaining my understanding of what the code I am writing implies, but I am having trouble finding what is causing the logic error.  p  pThe test program has account1 balance  100 and account2 balance  200 the withdraw amounts are account1  100 and account2  201 so obviously 100 should follow the if return and account 2 should follow the else return however that is not the case.  p  precodepublic int withdrawdouble amount      AccountBalance  this.AccountBalance  amount  Setting AccountBalance to what it would be when the withdraw amount is subtracted     if 0 lt AccountBalance  testing if 0 is less than AccountBalance         return intAccountBalance  if so then i return the new positive balance      else         return intAccountBalance  intamount if less then 0 i return to what the balance was before withdraw was subtracted because i cant have a negative balance   codepre  pThis is the following output i am receiving in CMDp  precodeFgtjava BankDemo The balance of account1 is 100.0 The balance of account2 is 200.0 account1 information John Smith AccountNumber 12345 Balance 0.0  account2 information John Calipari AccountNumber 54321 Balance 1.0 codepre  pThe above two accounts are the same falsep  pLast though I have is perhaps this the error is not in this method and in a different method throughout the class.  I dont believe this is the case because i have triple checked, but if that seems like a possibility feed back would be great because I would turn focus from this method to others in my class.  p

Negative 1065 pIve been tasked with creating a windows service that transforms and migrates data from one database to another. The database that I am pulling from was developed by one of our subdepartments, and I have no say in the structure of that database.p  pMy problem is that the database that Im pulling from has some intrinsic flaws that Im having trouble working around. The biggest one is that on many tables, the primary key is set up as a composite primary key... this wouldnt be that big of an issue, but the other tables that are supposed to be associated only have part of the composite key to reference.p  pFor example, People has ID and Surname as a composite key. ID is a surrogate auto increment integer key, and Surname is a varchar. The ID column alone is enough to uniquely identify a person, but for some reason they also included the surname in the composite key. Project is supposed to reference People to signify who the project is assigned to... but Project just has PersonID, not the surname.p  pI was looking at their database and Access front end, and there is no actual relationship defined between the two.... its just logically maintained via their front end.p  pSo, how can I add my own navigation property if the table Im joining from doesnt have all of the columns it needs as specified by the other tables composite primary key Technically, I have the ID number, which is all I need to logically make the association, but entity framework requires that all of the composite key columns are mapped in the referential constraint.p  pI could ignore the navigation property and have my program add logic to get around the gaps, but lazy loading means that I would have to build my queries in stages then.p  pIs there some way to ignore a column of a composite key if it doesnt meaningfully contribute to the identity of the tablep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should also note that I will never be writing to their database. Im only going to be querying their data. The user account Im connecting with has only been granted select permissions.p
Negative 1065 pI think that this might be a bug in InDesign but I thought that it might be handy to know.p  pHeres how to recreate Create a  rectangle 200px x 200px, with a 4pt stroke. Set Align stroke to INSIDE. Set the top left xy pos of the rectangle to 100px,100px so that you can easily see changes, and leave the Reference Point in the top left. Now when you change stroke widths, everything is fine, and change corner types, everything is fine, EXCEPT the Fancy Corners. So if you choose Fancy Corners, the xy becomes 96,96 and total widthheight changes to 208 x 208 which is incorrect. Now change the Align Stroke to OUTSIDE, and the xy changes back to 100,100 and the rectangle size changes back to 200 x 200. Completely backwards, but just for the Fancy Corners.p  pPlease comment if this is an expected response.p
Negative 1065 pIm sure this is simple, but I just cant seem to figure it out.  Basically, Im trying to force codeListBoxItemcode from allowing itself to go outside of codeListBoxcode width.

Negative 1065 pIm trying to use the Devart library to connect to an Oracle server using Windows authentication. Basically the client impersonates the Windows user that has access to the database using the LogonUser Windows API function with logon type LOGON32LOGONNEWCREDENTIALS and then attempts to connect to the server, but the server complains that the user doesnt have permission to access the database the user does have permission because I can connect to the server using sqlplus client running as that user. I checked the server logs after the connection attempt and I can see that the user trying to connect is the user that started the client, not the impersonated user so it makes sense that the connection fails. The question is why is this user being used and not the impersonated user as would be expected Its interesting to note that if the LogonUser function is called with logon type LOGON32LOGONNETWORKCLEARTEXT then the connection is done using the impersonated user and the connection works fine. The problem is that we cannot use this logon type because the client needs to access other resources while the connection is open, and under this impersonation mode this is not possible.p  pThis is the connection string being usedp  precodedata sourceDESCRIPTIONADDRESSLISTADDRESSPROTOCOLTCPHOSThostPORTportCONNECTDATASERVICENAMEserviceNameunicodetrueConnect ModePoolingFalse codepre  pI tried adding Integrated Securityyes to the connection string as is suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8837458oracleconnectionstringwithwindowsauthenticationherea but it complains that integrated security doesnt exist.p  pTo summarize the problem the client impersonates a user that has permission on the database using LogonUser function and logon type LOGON32LOGONNEWCREDENTIALS but the connection is done using the user that started the process, not the impersonated user.

Negative 1065 pfellow Java programmers. I have been faced with the task of using an SSH connection to a server to load webpages from another server. Pretty soon I found out that my knowledge of networking protocols is extremely limited. First, I tried dynamic port forwarding  to no avail, it is available only in commercial libraries and all of them are FAR out of my financial reach. Then I learned that with JSch, you can actually create something called a direct tcpIP channel the concept of which I am still trying ot grasp, and I found some code here on stackoverflow that is supposed to use it to send an HTTP request to a remote server through an SSH connection to another server using JSch.

Negative 1065 pIm currently investigating what the runtime of different programming languages looks like behind the scenes.  For a compiled language like C, people usually give the explanation of Code is compiled to assembly which is assembled and linked into a binary executable.  The executable is then loaded into memory and the CPU interprets it.  My question is how does the CPU know where to look for the next instruction to execute  Is it a memory address stored in one of the registersp

However, if we split up emRem as emADem, emBCDem, we cannot preserve the dependency emABCem  emDem.

Negative 1065 pI have an codeAsyncTaskcode which I am using to create a codeSocketcode connection. Within my codedoInBackgroundcode method, I havep  precodeSocket socket  new SocketHOSTNAME, PORTNUMBER codepre  pFor my case, this line of code hangs when I try to connect via a cellular network. It never finishes executing and eventually the app crashes. Because the information from the codeServercode was necessary to me, I did something like thisp  precodeAttemptConnection attemptConnection  new AttemptConnection  this is the AsyncTask attemptConnection.execute.get codepre  pNow I realize this is bad because the purpose of codeAsyncTaskcode is to run parallel to the main thread and this is halting processing on the main thread. However, my app cant really go anywhere until the information from the Server is acquired so I kind of NEED this AsyncTask to finish.p  pBecause the codeSocketcode connection fails and hangs some times though, there are cases where this causes freezes on my device and an eventual crash of my app. So I want something better. The solution I came up with isp  precodeattemptConnection.execute try      Thread.sleep3000  catch Exception e   attemptConnection.cancel  codepre  pBut I wonder if this is any better I cant cancel the process internally because the codetry  catchcode that should catch errors with the codeSocketcode connection is never reached. The code hangs there and no errors are ever caught. But the above idea also seems like a really hacky way to do it Im wondering if this approach is as bad as my gut tells me it is, and if so, what are some better ways to handle thisp

Negative 1065 pEDIT  Sorry to waste your time. My problem was simple, I just had the variable declared as extern in the main program.  I thought something was right with my operator definition.  I do see that I have other issues, like the operator isnt right below.  But, the main issue was just the missing variable.p  hr  pI havent used operator overloading in literally 20 years.  So, Im rather rusty.  But, my goal is to be able to build map, hash map or unsorted map, where I can store and retrieve an internal ID integer from an IPv6 address.  Which of those kinds of structures would be most suitable for my purpose, Im open to recommendations. I figured Id try a map first, but, if that isnt the best choice, let me know.  Im told that the requirements of my application will require up to about 100,000 IPv6 addresses.  Though Im also told it probably wont be more than 10,000 for at least a year or two.  In any case, my goal is, when handed an IPv6 address, I want to quickly locate my internal ID number for that address.p  pSo, basically, my understanding is that to be able to use the map classes, I need to provide an lt operator.  And, while at it, I might as well provide the remaining comparison operators. At first, I created the operators not as friend functions, with only one seen operator, and I got a compiler error, saying it was looking for an operator for with two operands.  I searched the answers here, and found an answer to that question, I made it friend functions.  This time, I dont get a compiler error. But, I get a linker errorp  pLNK2001 unresolved external symbol class stdmap,class stdallocator   first first3VmapVipmapclassHUlessVipmapclassstdVallocatorUpairCBVipmapclassHstd3stdA    cProjectsmapdemomapdemomapdemo.obj mapdemop  pIm using Visual Studio 2010 in x64 mode, but, I also want the code to work with VS 2008 x64.

The only difference is the value of one field CLIVSEULp  pIve a partial class CLI with DataAnnontations likes Required etc. on multiple fields.

For the Delivery Adress, CNOM is not required. p  pIn my view, when Ive a form to update a Delivery Address, I dont display CNOM because it isnt required.  But when Ive a view to update a Client, I display CNOM because its required. p  pHow can I do this  I think about inheritance, but I cant apply changes on datacontext because it isnt a CLI entity, or add an Entity with the type Client or DeliveryAddress...p  pI also try to work with the ModelState ModelState.RemoveCNOM, but when I SaveChanges the error persists.p  pThank you all for helpp

Then I want to apply a function to any element of this, the biharm function that I wrote in the example. The problem is that, while for small matrices I have no problems, I have the necessity to apply this operation to very large matrices such as 10003. In the sigm function, that I wrote to do that, I first initialize S and then I wrote two annidated for cycles. However, this is slow for large matrices. Does anyone has an idea on how to speed up this I think using apply but I cannot figure out the correct way. Here below a fully reproducible example. Thanks in advance for any advice.

Negative 1065 pAt my work I have to do a weekly job of cleaning up a raw data file so it matches a specific form.p  pThe data comes in a CSV file so that all the data for one record is on one row.  What the CSV looks likep  ul lipEach record row has to be split into 140 columns.pli lipThere can be over 20,000 rows in one CSV.pli lipThe file is not delimited by a symbol, but rather each column is abr specific number of characters into the row data string with abr specific length.pli lipThe assigned space for columns is not constant. A last name column is longer than a product code column.pli lipWe also need to change the formatting of some columns afterbr importing. Thats why in the code portion I have 00 for data1. I plan on adding more of them later if I get the code to workbr reasonably fast.pli ul  pWhat has been used so far is a simple method where we dump the CSV file contents into the first column of Sheet1, then the formulas in Sheet2 use mid function to parse through the 20,000 rows of data and split it into columns. Ex MIDSheet1A1,B1,B2 , where B1 and B2 contain the specific location and length for this column p  pHowever, because the Sheet2 is practically completely full of the mid formula, the filesize is over 50 mb. This makes the Workbook slow to work with and it has been known to crash with large files.p  pTo me, a better way of parsing through the rows would be with VBA. However, I attempted to create an array loop that would parse through one row, put the values to Sheet2 and then loop until all rows are done. The code works, but it when I tried it with 23,943 rows of data, it locked up my computer for a good 11 minutes.p  pSo the question is am I stuck using the formulas, is there something wrong with my code or is there a working way of parsing through thisp  pHeres my codep  precodeOption Explicit Sub Attempt2  Dim Data1 To 140 As Variant Dim shSource As Range Dim i As Integer Dim location As Integer Dim Rows As Integer Dim LastRow As Integer   LastRow  WorksheetsSheet1.RangeA65536.EndxlUp.Row  For Rows  1 To LastRow  Set the source cell that is being parsed  Set shSource  WorksheetsSheet1.CellsRows, 1  Array picks up all 140 values  Data1  00  MidshSource, 1, 2 Data2  MidshSource, 3, 9 Data3  MidshSource, 12, 16 Data4  MidshSource, 28, 12 Data5  MidshSource, 40, 1 Data6  MidshSource, 41, 35 Data7  MidshSource, 76, 19 Data8  MidshSource, 95, 2 Data9  MidshSource, 97, 5 Data10  MidshSource, 102, 4 Data11  MidshSource, 106, 8 Data12  MidshSource, 114, 5 Data13  MidshSource, 120, 5 Data14  MidshSource, 125, 5  location  130   For i  15 To 113      Datai  MidshSource, location, 6     location  location  6  Next i  Data114  MidshSource, 724, 3 location  location  3  For i  115 To 118     Datai  MidshSource, location, 6     location  location  6  Next i  Data119  MidshSource, 751, 3 location  location  3  For i  120 To 123     Datai  MidshSource, location, 6     location  location  6  Next i  Data124  MidshSource, 778, 3 location  location  3  For i  125 To 140     Datai  MidshSource, location, 6     location  location  6 Next i  Print one row  For i  1 To 140     WorksheetsSheet2.CellsRows  1, i.Value  Datai Next i  Next Rows   End Sub codepre  pThanks for the helpp

The robot is bound in a box that is 100 units long, each sensor has a range of only 10 units and we consider any value from them greater than 7.5 to be invalid.p  pThe platform will move forward while X lt 95, then reverse while X  5, I want to use the filter to estimate X, and use the data coming in from LR to correct X when I get close to a wall. My points of contention are as followsp  ol lipAt a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv18TKAYWhX0ampt15m50squot relnofollow1550a in the video, Francis Govers says that if you lose a sensor then the error will go to infinity, and youll be able to tell that your sensor isnt giving good data. However when I implement that 1D case presented on the webpage, the error continues to decrease even when I feed it wildly varying data. Why Shouldnt the error increasepli lipRelating to 1, what do I do when the error gets too high or I know a sensor is giving invalid data Do I simply not include the sensor in the correction step until otherwisepli ol  pIm sorry if these have been asked before, Im normally very adept at finding answers myself, but these questions seem to be a bit obscure or more likely the answer is obvious but I just cant seem to find it myself. p

Negative 1065 pI am running a Django application with multiple web application servers scaling out horizontally.

Negative 1065 pHello dear Communauts,p  pIm am creating a terminal animated status report for a parallel software Im developing. Im using NCurses. Im having an issue related to the restoring of the standard behavior of the terminal. After running my software the terminal keeps having just 24 lines, no matter if I call endwin or I dont. Here the simplified codep  precodeint size10 initscr refresh whileKeepAlive       int j1       mvprintwj,0,Blah blah header       forint i0iltsizei           j             mvprintwj,0,Some blah blah                refresh        usleep1000000  endwin codepre  pKeepAlive is a control variable changed by another thread so the while is not infinite loop, but controlled loop. After running this software my terminal has only 24 lines, echo works, but theres plenty of blank space.p  pThanks a lot for your help, have funp  pEDITp  pI would like to share with you some information I found while attempting to solve my issuep  ol licurses ncurses is perfectly working under openMP, then you can imagine some threads doing your math calculations and one thread only one, be aware giving out some runtime infos.li licurse ncurses is NOT compatible with MPI. Well, the right stating would be is not completely compatible with MPI. MPI is really sophisticated about stdinstdoutstderr, since all outputs from all MPIprocesses could be redirected to a display which could be specified. Using any advanced terminal output overriding library will take to a fault of the code, or unexpected behaviors. li ol  pThats supported by the MPI faqp  blockquote   pMaybe. But probably not.p      pOpen MPI provides fairly sophisticated stdin  stdout  stderr forwarding. However, it does not work well with curses, ncurses, readline, or other sophisticated IO packages that generally require direct control of the terminal.p      pEvery application and IO library is different  you should try to see if yours is supported. But chances are that it wont work.p      pSorry. p blockquote  pfound a hrefhttpwww.openmpi.orgfaqcategoryrunningmpiruncursesreadline relnofollowhere MPI referencea.p  pWhat Ive discovered is that even if you appoint only one MPIprocess to manage all the curses output just that process calls initscr at the beginning and endwin at the end of his part of code there is no way to force curses to use the full terminal only default UNIX 24x80 will be available. Once MPI has been finalized your whole terminal will keep working in 24x80 mode until reset is called.p  pThanks to all communauts that helped me,p  pHave funp  pgfp
Negative 1065 pI currently made a linux daemon and an apache module that is expected to use only one segment for reading and writing configuration data to and from memory in order to block out DoS attackers.p  pThe problem is, the system memory requirement is too high. For example, If I reserve one 10MB memory block for configuration data space to be shared across all apache children in order to temporary lock bad IP addresses, I want it where its only 10MB, not 10MB times the number of apache processes.p  pSo far, I found out through experimentation that every call I make to shmat causes my program to consume 10MB of memory until I make a call to shmdt.p  pMy new idea is to have the parent apache process make the shmat call and somehow make the return address of that call global to all apache children until apache is terminated.p  pI read up on pipes and think its a good idea, but I dont know exactly how to add them to my apache module.p  pHere is some fragments of my codep  precodeaphookpostconfigvoidbeforefork, NULL,NULL,APRHOOKFIRST aphookchildinitvoidafterfork, NULL,NULL,APRHOOKFIRST  static int beforeforkaprpoolt pconf, aprpoolt plog,aprpoolt ptemp, serverrec s static int afterforkaprpoolt p,serverrec s codepre  pI understand it does nothing, but I learned that the function in aphookpostconfig which is beforefork is executed before apache starts its forking process, then sometime after, the function in aphookchildinit which is afterfork is executed.p  pVarious sources claim that I should use pipes but I dont know where to insert them exactly. From what I gather, I declare an integer array with up to room for 3 elements and then call a pipe function on it then use one index for reading and one index for writing.p  pMy thought is to add this lines under the includesp  precodestatic int fd[2] codepre  pMy thought is to add these lines in beforeforkp  precodepipefd int idshmgetMID,MSIZE,0x666 const char memshmatid,0,0  lt that line allocates memory codepre  pand MID and MSIZE have already been set to valid values beforehand.p  pSo after the shared memory allocation, I want mem to be accessible to all apache children. Sources state I should use read and write commands with the fd array but Im trying to figure out where to best add the function.p  pShould I just call write right after the memory allocation and before the beforefork function finishes or is there a way I can define the hook that can give me access to the parent again so that I can set up the write routinep

Negative 1065 pFor those that dont know what Im talking about, Xcode 6.0 added new features, IBDesignable and IBInspectable.p  pWhen you tag your custom views with IBInspectable properties, those properties show up in the Attributes Inspector in IB. p  pLikewise, when you tag a custom UIView subclass with IBDesignable, Xcode compiles your views and invokes the code to render your view objects right in the Xcode window so you can see what they look like.p  pThe technique for adding IBDesignable and IBInspectable attributes to custom views is pretty much identical in Swift and ObjectiveC. IBInspectable properties appear in the Interface Builder Attributes Inspector regardless of which language you use to define them.p  pIve created a category of UIView in ObjectiveC and an extension of UIView in Swift that promote the borderWidth, cornerRadius, borderColor, and layerBackgroundColor properties of the views underlying layer as properties of the view. If you change the property, the extensioncategory does type conversion as required and forwards the change to the layer. p  pThe IBInspectable part works great. I see and can set the new properties in the IB attributes inspector.p  pI could have sworn that last week, the IBDesignable attribute on my view categoryextension was working too, and I could see my custom UIView category rendering in IB with its changed layer attributes. This week it isnt working.p  pWas I hallucinating p  pCan categoriesextensions of existing system classes draw their custom UI in Interface Builder when they are set up with IBDesignablep

Negative 1065 pIm tying to make a python program to help me make simple edits to a config file. I want to be able to read the file, replace a section of the file and then write the changes. One of the problems i have been having is that there are multiple lines that are the same. For example the config file looks likep  precode Panel   panel      backgroundcolor black     fontweight bold     height 1.86em  panel.unlockscreen, panel.loginscreen      backgroundcolor transparent codepre  pthere are two lines that contain backgroundcolor so i am unable to test if the line is equal to a string because if i were to replace every line containing backgroundcolor i would get unwanted changes. Also I dont want to have to rely on the index of the line because as lines of the config file are added or removed, it will change.  Any help would be appreciatedp
Negative 1065 peveryonep  pIm doing a research project involving detecting the simultaneous detection of palms placed on a multitouch screen. Ive done quite a bit googling and found out that theres a lot of libraries both for gesture recognition AS3, a hrefhttpsgithub.comfljotGestouch relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfljotGestoucha for instance and computer vision. Im working with JSTouchController a hrefhttpsgithub.comsebleedelisleJSTouchController relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsebleedelisleJSTouchControllera, but it  tracks only 5 fingers at a time. So if I place one palm on a screen and the library finds all five fingers, it wont track second palm being placed at all. It works correctly from time to time, though.p  pSo, the question is are there any libraries to track ten fingers simultaneously with acceptable quality on modern touch screensp

Negative 1065 pThis is a basic question about SAML protocol and how it specifies verification of a SAML token.p  pLooking an different diagrams and resources, it looks like the service provider doesnt need to make calls to the Identity Provider IdP in order to verify a SAML token. I am interested in clarifying step 5 Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP from wikia hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSecurityAssertionMarkupLanguage relnofollowSAMPLwikia. Mainly token verification is done on Service Provider without additional calls to IdP. br Token validation consists of the 3 stepsbr 1.Verify token is wellformedbr 2.Verify token is coming from the intended authoritybr 3.Verify token is meant for the current applicationbrp  pIs this assumption right p

When you need to codeevalcode a codePredcode, you can simply compose the required traits into an anonymous subclass  codenew HasUser with HasPost  val user  new Usertrue val post  new Postfalse codep  hr  pI figured I could translate this into Haskell by turning the traits into classes and parameterising codePredcode by the type classes it requires, rather than the concrete type it operates on.p  precode conjunction of partiallyapplied constraints    k gt Constraint gt k gt Constraint gt k gt Constraint type family  c1 c2 a  Constraint where      c1 c2 a  c1 a, c2 a  data Pred c where     Leaf  forall a. c a gt a gt Bool gt Pred c     And  Pred c1 gt Pred c2 gt Pred c1  c2     Or  Pred c1 gt Pred c2 gt Pred c1  c2     Not  Pred c gt Pred c  data User  U      isActive  Bool  data Post  P      isPublic  Bool   class HasUser a where     user  a gt User class HasPost a where     post  a gt Post  userIsActive  Pred HasUser userIsActive  Leaf isActive . user  postIsPublic  Pred HasPost postIsPublic  Leaf isPublic . post  userCanComment  userIsActive And postIsPublic  ghcigt t userCanComment  userCanComment  Pred HasUser  HasPost codepre  pThe idea is that each time you use codeLeafcode you define a requirement such as codeHasUsercode on the type of the whole without specifying that type directly. The other constructors of the tree bubble those requirements upwards using constraint conjuction codecode, so the root of the tree knows about all of the requirements of the leaves. Then, when you want to codeevalcode your predicate, you can make up a type containing all the data the predicate needs or use tuples and make it an instance of the required classes.p  pHowever, I cant figure out how to write codeevalcodep  precodeeval  c a gt Pred c gt a gt Bool eval Leaf f  f eval l And r  x gt eval l x ampamp eval r x eval l Or r  x gt eval l x  eval r x eval Not p  not . eval p codepre  pIts the codeAndcode and codeOrcode cases that go wrong.

I think this is because codecode appears fullyapplied in codeconjLcode, not in curried form as it does in codeAndcode.p  pNeedless to say, its surprising to me that Scala does this better than Haskell.

Negative 1065 pIm trying to get this a hrefhttpsgithub.comspolettoiOSHTML5Tethering relnofollowgithub projecta to work, but seem to be having some issues there are a lot of outdated dependencies and some code that Ive fixed, but now Im stuck on the networking portion.  Basically my local host os x 10.10.4 establishes an adhoc connection with a handheld device.  The app will route all local, outbound traffic, to devtun0.  A python script reads the packets and forwards them over a web socket to an HTML5 app running on the handheld device acting as a proxy.  The handheld then forwards the traffic to a server script through another websocket that makes the actual request coming from the original host.p  pIve been able to accomplish this so far but to a limited degree.  My real problem comes from trying to bring my localhost online through a custom network adapter.  I followed the instructions from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions87442virtualnetworkinterfaceinmacosx63753076375307this solutiona but run into where they say p  blockquote   pNote that we have mimicked an Ethernet device so Mac OS X layer of networking will note that a cable is unplugged and will not let you activate the interface through the GUI.p blockquote  pSeeing how my WiFi device is connected to the handheld via adhoc it wont have internet.  However the custom network adapter that I added through preferences.plist which reads from devtun0 tells me that its not connected because a cable is unplugged.  How do I convince or make OS X bring the custom network adapter onlineconnectedp

Negative 1065 pMy companys webpage, a hrefhttpwww.carlsondesign.com relnofollowwww.carlsondesign.coma, is taking a very long time to load on Chrome, 20  30 seconds.  When I analyzed the resource timing I noticed that the response time for the main page is what is taking so long, 85 of load time. It is a Wordpress website hosted by GoDaddy and the website is using the wordpress plugin, W3 Total Cache, but that doesnt seem to help. The thing that confuses me the most is that the problem is nonexistent on IE and Firefox, page load times are 1  2 seconds. I know that the website is very large and could be optimized but I dont think that it is bad enough to cause page load times  20 seconds. Please help, I am clueless.p

Negative 1065 pIve written a windows service in C that interfaces with a third party via external web service calls SOAP.  Some of the calls respond quickly and some slowlyp  pfor example, quick  retrieving a list of currencies slow  retrieving a historical value of currencies per product over many yearsp  pThe external service works fine when I run it on my local machine  the quick calls runs for about 20 seconds the slow calls runs for about 30 minutes.  I cant do anything about the speed of the 3rd party service and I dont mind the time it takes to return an answer..p  pMy problem is that when I deploy my service to my Azure Virtual Machine  The quick call works perfectly like it does locally the slow ones just never returns anything.  I have tried exception handling, logging to files, logging to eventLog.  p  pThere is no clear indication of what goes wrong  it just seems that for whatever reason  the long running web service calls, never return successfully to Azure.p  pIve read somewhere that there is some sort of connectionrecycling happening every 4 minutes, which I suspect is somehow causing the external web service response to land up somewhere in a void with the load balancer or whatever not knowing any longer whom requested the content.p  pI start by creating the request with the relevant SOAP envelope, like thisp  precodeHttpWebRequest tRequest  HttpWebRequestWebRequest.Createendpoint codepre  pThen i set the stuff, like thisp  precodetRequest.ClientCertificates.AddclientCertificate tRequest.PreAuthenticate  true tRequest.KeepAlive  true tRequest.Credentials  CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials tRequest.ContentLength  byteArray.Length tRequest.ContentType  textxml charsetutf8 tRequest.Headers.AddSOAPAction, httpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope tRequest.Method  POST tRequest.Timeout  3600000 ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback  delegate  return true  the SSL certificate is bad  Stream requestStream  tRequest.GetRequestStream  requestStream.WritebyteArray, 0, byteArray.Length requestStream.Close requestStream.Dispose works fine up to this point.

Negative 1065 pI have 3 boxes  B1, B2, B3. Each box initially contains a mixture of 3 different kind of fruits say  Apple, Orange, Mango. Our goal is to arrange the fruits in the boxes in such a manner that each box contains only one type of fruit. So you need to shift fruits from one box to another in order to make the arrangement. How to do this with minimum number of movementsp  pSay 9 integers are given. As each box initially contains all 3 types of fruits, you can divide 9 integers into 3 groups, each group representing the initial permutation of fruits in B1, B2, B3 respectively. Consider 10, 17, 20, 32, 29, 19, 43, 27, 28. Fruits are represented in order of Apple, Orange amp Mango. So The first box contains 10 Apple, 17 Orange amp 20 Mango and so on. p  pWhat is the minimum number of movements required so that the mentioned boxes contain only one type of fruit. Any box can contain any 1 type of fruit.p
