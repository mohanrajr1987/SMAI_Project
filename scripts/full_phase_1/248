Positive 248 pIve reversed the following algorithm from a challenge binary Im investigatingp  precodedef encryptplain     l  lenplain     a  10     cipher        for i in range0, l         if i  a lt l  1             cipher  chr xorplain[i], plain[ia]          else             cipher  chr xorplain[i], plain[a]           if ordplain[i]  2  0 a  1  even         else a  1  odd      return cipher  from binascii import hexlify print hexlifyencryptthis is a test string codepre  pEssentially, it XORs each character with another character in the string, offset by codeacode. codeacode initial value is code10code, as the function iterates over the characters in the string, codea 1code if  the characters value is even or codea  1code if its odd.p  pIve worked out in my head how to reverse this cipher and retrieve plain text, it would require the use of a recursive function to find out which character offsets are evenodd in the original string. IE Given the properties of XOR  2, we now that if codecipher[0]code is odd then either codeplain[0]code or codeplain[10]code is odd, but not both. Similarly if codecipher[0]code is even then both codeplain[0]code and codeplain[10]code are even, or both are odd. From there a recursive algorithm should be able to work the rest.p  pOnce we know which characters in plaintext are evenodd, reversing the rest is trivial. Ive spent a few hours working this out, but now Im at loss implementing it.p  pIve used basic recursive algorithms in the past but never anything that branches out to solve something like this.p  pGiven a codeciphercode string resulting from this function, how could we suse a recursive algorithm tos determine the parity of each character in the original plain stringp  pstrongEDITstrong Sorry just to be clear and in response to a comment, after scratching my head on this for a few hours I thought the recursion strategy outlined above would be the only way to solve this. If not Im open to any hintsassistance to solving the title question.p

Positive 248 pGiven string of digits like 72388 and int n, delete n characters from the sting such the resulting string contains minimal number representation, you must preserve relative position of digits.

Positive 248 pSo Im hooking into an application api that returns a flat array of values  the order of the values defines the specific structure of data, and Id like to be able to transform this array into an object that reflects this underlying structure.p  pWorking backward, this is what Id like to end up withp  precodeappnameappX,  affectednodes  [                        nodenamenodeX,nodeidxxx,                        nodenamenodeY,nodeidyyy                     ]  codepre  pBut this is what Im givenp  precode[appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] codepre  pThe actual data is much more complex, with multiple tiers of attribute arrays nested within each other. As you can see, Im given the length of each nested attribute in the original flat array, represented in my example as code2code. Ive started wrangling with transforming the flat array into a proper object structure and the whole business seems very inefficient and difficult to maintain. My approach currently looks something like thisp  precodevar arr  [appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] var obj    obj.appname  arr[0]  var numnodes  arr[1]  obj.affectednodes  []  var position  1  forvar i  0 i lt numnodes i     var subobj       subobj.nodename  arr[position  1]     subobj.nodeid  arr[position  2]     obj.affectednodes.pushsubobj     position  position  2  codepre  pThis is working, but I feel like there may be a more efficient solution out there that hasnt occurred to me. Is there a better algorithm or perhaps library function to accomplish this sort of taskp

Positive 248 pI am trying to put n players having different skill pointranging from 1003000 into r teams such that overall skill in each team is as close as possible to every other team.p  pI first sorted the players in descending order of skill points and top r players were put into each team. Now the team with lowest skill pointiterating and calculating sum gets the top player remaining.p  pFor eg.p  ul liA 600li liB 550li liC 400li liD 250li liE 220li liF 200li liG 150li liH 140li ul  pFor 2 teams, result will bep  ul liTeam A600,250,220,150 1220li liTeam B550,400,200,140 1290li ul  pIn another approach each team gets a player from top and a player from bottom.p  ul liTeam A600,140,400,2001340li liTeam B550,150,250,2201170li ul  pSo here 1st approach was better, but for different set of data sometimes approach 2 is optimum and sometimes approach 1 is optimum.p  pIs there any specific algorithm to do this I tried to read Microsofts TrueSkill algorithm, but it was way too complex.p
Positive 248 pI was trying to do a modified version of binary search  with squaring. I have completed the code and it works perfectly. Here I am using squares of 2 to find the location where the key becomes less than the arr[mid] . When this becomes true, I linearly square from the old mid stored in lo to the current mid to search for the key.p  pI know that the first part is OlogN since I am using squares to find the mid, but I am not sure whether the entire algorithm is OlogN or not, can someone help about this. The linear scanning is obviously not ON as it covers only a range between lets say 2k to 2k1 on the worst case.  How do I compute its bigoh complexity.p  pHeres the codep  precodepublic int searchint key, int arr[]      int lo  0, mid  1     while mid lt arr.length          if key lt arr[mid]              break          else if key gt arr[mid]              lo  mid  1          else if key  arr[mid]              return mid                  mid  2           while lo lt arr.length ampamp lo lt mid          if key  arr[lo]             return lo         lo          return 1  codepre  pIs the logic true if I use fibonacci numbers Since there is no squaring component anymore.p

It then has one operation that is checked every time if codex  ycode. Since the WORST case is when the list is composed of identical elements, this check is always true  so the third and fourth operations codexycode, and list appending are always performed.

Positive 248 pSuppose I have an ordered list of weights, having length M. I want to divide this list into N ordered nonempty sublists, where the sum of the weights in each sublist are as close to each other  as possible.  Finally, the length of the list will always be greater than or equal to the number of partitions.p  pFor examplep  pA reader of epoch fantasy  wants to read the entire Wheel of Time series in N  90 days.  She wants to read approximately the same amount of words each day, but she doesnt want to break a single chapter across two days.  Obviously, she also doesnt want to read it out of order either.  The series has a total of M chapters, and she has a list of the word counts in each.p  pWhat algorithm could she use to calculate the optimum reading schedulep  pIn this example, the weights probably wont vary much, but the algorithm Im seeking should be general enough to handle weights that vary widely.p  pAs for what I consider optimum, I would say that given the choice between having two or three partitions vary in weight a small amount from the average would be better than having one partition vary a lot.  Or in other words, She would rather have several days where she reads a few hundred more or fewer words than the average, if it means she can avoid having to read a thousand words more or fewer than the average, even once.  My thinking is to use something like this to compute the score of any given solutionp  plet W1, W2, W3 ... wN be the weights of each partition calculated by simply summing the weights of its elements. let x be the total weight of the list, divided by its length M. Then the score would be the sum, where I goes from 1 to N of X  wi2p  pSo, I think I know a way to score each solution.  The question is, whats the best way to minimize the score, other than brute forcep  pAny help or pointers in the right direction would be much appreciatedp

Positive 248 pThis is a general decision tree algorithm question of using attributes to split nodes based on entropy. I am using a Decision Tree algorithm in SQL Server Data Mining to predict the type of an animal. What I noticed was that the same input column  attribute is used twice to split the node. My understanding was that an input column  attribute could only be used once for splitting a node. For example, below reptiles is used to split each value of animals  1 and 0 . Based on what I have read so far, for a decision tree, once an input column  attribute is used to split a node value, you should not be using it again. You pick an attribute from remaining set of UNused attributes. Please let me know  correct me if I am wrong. Each attribute can take value of 1 or 0. I can understand reptiles 1 and reptiles0 when animals1. But once reptiles has been used as an attribute for a split, I dont understand why it is being used again for the animals0 split.p  precode                    reptiles1 gt     animals1 gt                                reptiles0 gt codepre  pAll   p  precode                    reptiles0 gt     animals0 gt                      reptiles1 gt  codepre

Negative 248 pWe use a base entity with properties such as version datetime needed for NHibernate and guid as key.p  pIt also has an Id int field with two functions.  Firstly to relate to legacy application key if there is one.  Secondly as a shorthand code for instance files are sometimes created based on these which would look ugly and long using our guid key.  My question is not really about pros and cons of base entities but about uptyping this Id to Int64p  pIt would not affect how it is stored within our MS SQL Server database. Would it have more cost in our cache and memory.  Is this really that much of a worryp  pI am interested to hear other downsides besides performance.  Consider also these values will probably be exposed through web services to third parties in time too.p  pThe alternative is to deal with the exceptions of larger integers as they arise and implement them specifically in derived entities.  The downside is this would need to be done in code and what would we do when we discover some cases when in production of larger integers  There would of course be input validation to stop actual errors but it may restrict expanding data.p

Somehow, although we are not entirely sure why, it is creating duplicate browser actions from a single request. To us, it looked as if the page was cached because it contained an invalid Struts Transaction Token, but in actuality a second executing version of the same request with the wrong session id was overwriting the original requests token in the session. Upgrading to 1.1.16 fixed the problem. p  pWhy some requests were getting duplicated but with different sessions ids is still a mystery ...p  pPaul.p

Negative 248 pWell.. the title is pretty descriptive, I have a bunch of tab activities which I implemented myself, didnt want to use the tabviews with activities inside them, so Its basically 5 activities calling each other every time the user clicks on the tabs displayed as a row of LinearLayouts at the bottom of the screen.p  pThe thing is that the way I do it now, everytime the user jumps from one activity to another, a new activity is created and launched. Of course, I can see Im wasting resources this way. So what I would like to do is to create every activity only once and then if the user wants to go back to the previous or any one that was already created and is probably paused just check on some kind of list or array to see if the activity can be recovered and only in the case it cant to lauch a new one.p  pMy question is, how can I check this should I save the intents and how to recover the activities afterwards Im kind of new with java.p  pGreetings Nelson R.

Negative 248 pI have a website developed in PHP.

Negative 248 pIve been looking at glibcnptls implementation of cancellation points, and comparing it to POSIX, and unless Im mistaken its completely wrong. The basic model used isp  precodeint oldtype  LIBCASYNCCANCEL  switch to asynchronous cancellation mode  int result  INLINESYSCALL... LIBCCANCELRESEToldtype codepre  pAccording to POSIXp  blockquote   pThe sideeffects of acting upon a cancellation request while suspended during a call of a function are the same as the sideeffects that may be seen in a singlethreaded program when a call to a function is interrupted by a signal and the given function returns [EINTR]. Any such sideeffects occur before any cancellation cleanup handlers are called.p blockquote  pMy reading of this passage is that if I call codeopencode, I can expect it emeitherem to get cancelled along with my whole thread before it fails to open a file, emorem to return a valid file descriptor or 1 and codeerrnocode value, but never to create a new file descriptor then lose it into the void. On the other hand, the glibcnptl implementation of cancellation points seems to allow for a race condition where the cancellation request occurs just after the syscall returns but before codeLIBCCANCELRESETcode takes place.p  pAm I crazy, or is their implementation really this broken And if so, does POSIX allow such broken behavior which seems to render cancellation completely unusable unless you defer it manually, or are they just blatantly ignoring POSIXp  pIf this behavior is in fact broken, whats the correct way to implement it without such a race conditionp

Line 1, position 1.  Im assuming this is due to it being derived from an xsd and not xml source. So XMLDocument expects a BOM in the declaration.p  pMy second issue is using the returned xsd as a dynamic source for a WPF treeview. I have seen static examples of XSDs being displayed in a WPF treeview by defining them in the XData of an xmldataprovider resource in the XAML. The XMLDataprovider has a source property but this takes URIs or there is the document property that would take an XMLDocument if I could sort the first issue.p  pMy application is WPF4 and uses MVVM so ideally the xsd would be represented as a property of a ViewModel which the treeview was then bound to, but thats another post.p

Negative 248 pIn Javascript, I would like to define a class with an inner or nested class.  Within the inner class Id like to be able to get access to the parent instance. How can I do this efficiently p  pSome code will show what I mean.

MyType1.prototype.SayHello  function          saythis.Name   says hello...       codepre  pNow I can use these classes like this p  precodevar x  new MyType1Victor x.SayHello  var c  new x.ChildElizabeth c.Introduce codepre  hr  pthat all works.  But it defines a new Child function or emtypeem, if you like for every instance of MyType1.  What Id like to do is get access to the parent class scope, without resorting to that inefficiency. Something like this p  precodefunction     MyType2  functionname         this.TypeName  MyType2         this.Name  name         this.Prop1  1872         var parentName  name           MyType2.prototype.SayHello  function          saythis.Name   says hello...           var c1  functionname          this.Description  parentName  s child,   name                          no go            c1.prototype.Introduce  function          saythis.Description  , greets you...           MyType2.prototype.Child  c1   codepre  pBut, this doesnt work.  The codeparentNamecode var is out of scope, of course. p  pIs there an efficient way for the Child instance in the constructor, or in any class function to gain access to the parent MyType2 instance p  hr  pI know that I could define the Child class to be an independent, nonnested class, then in the ctor for that, just pass the Parent instance. But this creates N references to the parent instance, one for every Child instance. That seems like an inefficiency Id like to avoid. p  pthanks for any tips.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong  the reason I want the Child to have access to the parent instance, is that the parent holds an object that is fairly expensive to create  something like a db connection  and Id like the child to be able to utilize that thing. p

Negative 248 pIve got the following setup.p  pA pagingScrollViewController with a UIScrollView as its view self.view  scrollView. In that scrollView I add the view of a rootViewController as subview.  The view of the rootViewController is an UIView on which I add one or the other view depending on internal logic.p  pThe UIScrollView is initialized with a frame equal to the applicationFrame, so 0, 20, 320 , 460. Which is fine because of the statusbar on top.p  pThe problem comes when adding the rootViewControllers view to the scrollview. In the creation process of the rootViewController its view is setup in loadView which is still commented out in my case. So the standard appel loadView is processed.p  pIt gives me a view which also has a frame of 0, strong20strong, 320, 460. Which is not as I would like to see it as now the View of the rootViewController is 40 pixels removed from the top of the actual iphone screen.p  pNow, this is of course easily fixed by manually setting the rootViewControllers view in loadView or assigning it a frame where the y is set to 0 in viewDidLoadp  pBut I cannot imaging that that is the way apple intended this to be done. Im not using Interface builder, so maybe thats the problem, apple intends me to use IB, but im stubborn on that subject p  pAm I using viewControllers the wrong way This seemed a nice way to split the logic of the scrollView away from the logic of the other views. p  pWhat would be the correct way to add the view of a second UIViewController to the view of a first UIViewController. In which the first viewController.view receives a frame of 0, 20 , 320, 460. And de second controller.view a frame of 0, 0, 320, 460 so basically the bounds of the first controller.viewp  pTheres a lot of use of the word controller and view in there, hope the question is clear though.p

Negative 248 pI am trying to make to make a reminder system and I am using quartz for my scheduling. However I come up with a couple possible ways how to do what I need to do but I am not sure what the best way is and how to test it.p  pBasically I have a reminder system that users can set reminders. It is like Google Calendar. You set the date and time that your event is and then you set a reminder by saying remind me 15 minutes beforep  pSo you could have a event on May 10th, 2011 959am and you could say reminded me 15 minutes beforep  pSo that would be May 10th, 1044am.p  pI will be in a hosted environment. My site and the scheduling will be running of in the same environment and even in the same solution. So it cant slow down the users browsing my site by much.p  pI am also using nhibernate and fluent nhibernate to do the db querying. I am using asp.net mvc 3 for my web site.p  pstrongOption 1.strongp  pDo a database query every minutes and get all reminders that should be sent out in that minute. This of course will mean a database query every minute and probably too intensive for a shared environment.p  pstrongOption 2.strongp  pDo a database query every 5 minutes and grab all the reminders that should be sent in that 5 minute block and store them in a collectionso memory and then check every minute which ones need to be sent out.p  pThis of course lessens the amount of queries done but not sure if this will get extremely memory intensive.p  pstrongOption 3strongp  pSame as Option 2 but send a query every 15 minutes and store in a collection.p  pThis of course means alot less databases queries but more stored in memory.p  pstrongOption 4strongp  pDo a database query every 15 minutes and get all reminders in that block and fire them out immediately.p  pThis means they wont be stored in memory very long and reduced amount of queries. However depending on when the user set to be reminded the email could arrive alot earlier then they set.p  pFor instance they said remind me at 1044am. I would have my scheduler start at 1000am and it would grab from 1000am to 1015am and then 1015am to 1030am then 1030am to 1045am.p  pSo that email would actually arrive 14 mins earlier then intended. p

Negative 248 pThis is obviously a topic that has been discussed many times, however my angle of approach here is a little different.  As far as I understand, a STE is considered a POCO it is not tied to the EF dll in any way, it just has some extra stuff inside of it for handling its own change tracking.  Assuming the following application layersp  precodeProj.Web Proj.Business Proj.Model Proj.DataAccess codepre  pAssuming codelazy loadingcode is not required, and were running in a 2tier setup, my understanding is that there would really be no difference between using STEs and POCOs.  Since were on the web and its a disconnected environment, the choices would be an additional SQL query on the codePostbackcode or having to attach the entity and set the properties to modified as necessary.  Again correct me if Im wrong the code would look identical.p  pLets consider a simple example, were handling a postback in a webform applicationp  precodePerson p  PersonManager.GetById2 we use the requery method PersonManager.Updatep  If we dig into PersonManager.Update well see the following PersonRepository.ApplyChangesp were assuming STEs are used so this API is available PersonRepository.SaveChanges codepre  pAssuming later down the line we are asked to promote the architecture to a 3tier, introducing a WCF transport layer in between the Proj.Bussiness and Proj.Web, lets call it Proj.Services.  If we were using STEs to begin with, arent we in a much better spot  All wed have to do is forward the calls to the business layer, without having to modify it or the repositories in any wayp  precodePersonService.UpdatePerson p      PersonManager.Updatep  codepre  pIf for example we were using POCOs lets assume snapshot, wed have to code in a way where we have to check if this entity already exists in the context if were running 2tier and if not 3tier attach it and set its properties to modified.  Seems like a lot more work when youre not sure if a 3tier solution would be needed in the future.  On the other hand if you were coding against STEs all along, the only extra unnecessary which doesnt really harm anything code you would have put in is a call to ApplyChanges.  Otherwise I dont think youre losing anything again assuming lazy loading is not required.  What are your thoughts on the subjectp

Negative 248 pImagine youre working on a .Net 4.0 project that is made up of hundreds of assemblies, each having its own resource file .resx for localization. The localized strings are accessed from C through classes autogenerated with ResXFileCodeGenerator which creates a ResourceFile.Designer.cs file codestring test  ResourceFile.TestStringcodep  pEach assembly has localized strings which are particular to it, but there are strings which are common to all assemblies. You tell yourself that it would be nice to have those common strings in a parent resource file, on which the code would fall back if the resource key is not available in the local resource file. You then say Hey inheritance could work here. And indeed, doing something like this in the autogenerated designer file does work     codeinternal class ResourceFile  ParentResourceFilecode That is, strings not defined in codeResourceFilecode, but defined in codeParentResourceFilecode, can still be accessed with codeResourceFile.StringInParentFilecode.p  pBut something in the designer files header troubles you emChanges to this file may cause incorrect behavior and strongwill be lost if the code is regeneratedstrong.em Plus you know playing in the autogenerated designer files is frowned upon.

Negative 248 pI am building an app that uses Cocos2d to create a map of content technically a big Tree in the graph theory sense.  Each node is represented by a sprite with its own texture, with the leaf nodes all having a second button pressed texture.  In addition, some of the nodes are PNG animations.  I have one sprite sheet containing the 130 or so node textures, and 3 other sprite sheets for the animations.  All in all those 4 files add up to only about 18.4 MB.p  pIf I run the app and DONT run the cocos2d part i.e. Never launch the framework at all and therefore never load the textures the app runs at around 10 MB.  When I load Cocos2d and those sprite sheets, the memory shoots up past 90 MB.p  pAll my research seems to say I am doing things in the most efficient way possible, but with the memory usage already so high I get a lot of memory related crashes on iPad 1.p  pIs this normal for cocos2d  Since the images themselves arent so large, is it using so much memory because of the number of sprites  Are there ways to bring the memory footprint down  I am at a loss, and very much under the gun...p

Negative 248 pI was trying to define a dynamic method using the GroovyDSL scripting capabilities in IntelliJ. The starting guide a hrefhttpconfluence.jetbrains.netdisplayGRVYScriptingIDEforDSLawareness relnofollowScripting IDE for DSL awarenessa gives you a good idea on how to get started with this. The dynamic method definition in my DSL is more complex than the example though and I am not quite sure how to build this. You can imagine it working like a hrefhttpgrails.orgdoclatestguide5.20Object20Relational20Mapping2028GORM29.html5.4.120Dynamic20Finders relnofollowdynamic finder methodsa in Grails except that you can combine an arbitrary number of criteria with a boolean codeAndcode keyword in any order. All keywords are not defined in the class that I am invoking the method on but could be defined in the GDSL file. The method always starts with codesubmitTransactionWithcode. Heres an examplep  precodeclientDSL.submitTransactionWithCriteria1AndCriteria2AndCriteria3arg1, arg2, arg3 codepre  pI started out with this but that only works for one criteria and doesnt take into account that you can combined multiple criteria in any order.p  precodedef ctx  contextctype my.client.ClientDSL  contributorctx      [Criteria1, Criteria2, Criteria3].each          method name submitTransactionWithit,                type java.util.Map,                 params [args java.util.Collection]       codepre  pI was wondering if theres special support for that kind of dynamic method. Id also be interested in how the DSL for Grails is modeled internally in IntelliJ.p

Negative 248 pand greetings to all members. Im working on a small embedded data acquisition hardware which collects data periodically and runs a small embedded webserver. If requested the server replies with a very basic html page along with the collected data in 128 bytes TCP chunks. The size of the transferred data is maximum 64K. p  pThe embedded TCPIP stack is quite thin and the MCU is not the fastest, so Id like the requester application to have a progress indicator a progress bar or similar. Since the length of data array to be transferred is constantly changing the server should insert the actual data length in the beginning of the data array. The requester app should read this length information and update the progress of the progressbar. With the following code I can receive the server content but only can access the data when the transfer is completedp  precode        TcpClient msnTcpConn  new TcpClient         try                      msnTcpConn.ConnectHostName, 80              if msnTcpConn.Connected                               string msg                    NetworkStream netStream  msnTcpConn.GetStream                 System.IO.StreamWriter sw  new System.IO.StreamWriternetStream                 System.IO.StreamReader sr  new System.IO.StreamReadernetStream                  string req                   req  GET  HTTP1.0rn                 req  Host   HostName  rn                 req  rn                  sw.Writereq                 sw.Flush                 numa  0                 peek  0                 while sr.Peekgt0                                      peek  sr.Peek                     numa                     textBox1.Text  Convert.ToStringnuma                     msg  sr.ReadLine                                                    webBrowser1.DocumentText  msg                 msnTcpConn.Close                          else                              MessageBox.ShowNot connected.                               catch UriFormatException UriExc                      MessageBox.ShowError            codepre  pIn the above code, textBox1 is not getting refreshed in the while loop only when the loop is exited.

Negative 248 pI know that A algorithm implementation problems are relatively common on stackoverflow Ive been through a lot of other postings. I have been trying for the past couple of days to implement a simple C A system. I am only allowing movement in four directions no diagonal checking, so this should be an especially simple task this is also why I only have a heuristic as my cost. Also, I have stepped through the code and, for all starting positions, an object is able to successfully find a valid path to the target. The issue, however, is that I am unable to step back through the parent pointers and store the path  movement sequence. I am using references, so I am not quite sure why there is an issue with the pointer assignments. I ran through what I think the code is doing on paper for a few, short example paths and I do not understand what I am doing incorrectly. Looping through the parent pointers, which should eventually get to NULL infinitely prints the posY of the target.p  pHere is my header filep  precode    to access a priority queues underlying container, you must extend functionality     template ltclass T, class S, class Cgt         Samp ContainerstdpriorityqueueltT, S, Cgtamp q              struct HackedQueue  private stdpriorityqueueltT, S, Cgt                  static Samp ContainerstdpriorityqueueltT, S, Cgtamp q                      return q.ampHackedQueuec                                       return HackedQueueContainerq          different enough from a Grid to be a new object     typedef struct Node         int cost, posX, posY         Node parent         Nodeint cost  0, int posX  0, int posY  0, Node parent  0  costcost, posXposX, posYposY, parentparent          overloading operators will make the cpp file easier to read         bool operatorconst Nodeamp rhs             return posX  rhs.posX ampamp posY  rhs.posY                  bool operatorltconst Nodeamp rhs             return posX  rhs.posX ampamp posY  rhs.posY ampamp cost lt rhs.cost               Node     typedef struct NodeCompare         compare n1 against a node n2         bool operatorconst Nodeamp n1, const Nodeamp n2             if n2 has a lower cost, it has a higher priority             return n2.cost lt n1.cost               NodeCompare     a list is essentially a linked list, a vector is a robust array if you do not need random access, lists are faster than vectors     we need random access for the priority queue, because it will constantly be resorted     bool PathSearchstdlistltNodegtamp path, const Worldamp World, const WorldObjamp obj, const Nodeamp target path is our output list     void NodeSuccessorsstdpriorityqueueltNode, stdvectorltNodegt, NodeComparegtamp open, stdlistltNodegtamp closed, Nodeamp parentNode, const Worldamp World, const Nodeamp target     int Heuristicint posX, int posY, const Nodeamp target  codepre  pAnd, heres my implementationp  precodebool PathSearchstdlistltNodegtamp path, const Worldamp World, const WorldObjamp obj, const Nodeamp target     stdpriorityqueueltNode, stdvectorltNodegt, NodeComparegt open     stdlistltNodegt closed     put our starting position into our queue of nodes to inspect     Node startHeuristicobj.GetposX, obj.GetposY, target, obj.GetposX, obj.GetposY     open.pushstart     whileopen.empty         Node bestNode  open.top has the lowest score by definition         open.pop         ifbestNode  target made it to the target             Node ptrNode  ampbestNode             whileptrNode this is where we would reconstruct the path                 stdcoutltltptrNodegtposYltltstdendl                 ptrNode  ptrNodegtparent                          return 1                  NodeSuccessorsopen, closed, bestNode, World, target look at the Nodes neighbors         closed.pushbackbestNode          return 0 no path found  check for towers and check for boundaries if they exist, skip the creation of that node pathfinding works for up, down, left, right, but not diagonal movement void NodeSuccessorsstdpriorityqueueltNode, stdvectorltNodegt, NodeComparegtamp open, stdlistltNodegtamp closed, Nodeamp parentNode, const Worldamp World, const Nodeamp target     stdvectorltNodegtamp openVec  Containeropen     int offsetX, offsetY     bool skip     forint i  0 i lt 4 i         offsetX  0 offsetY  0         skip  0         ifi  0 offsetY  30 up         else ifi  1 offsetY  30 down         else ifi  2 offsetX  30 left         else ifi  3 offsetX  30 right         add check for out of boundaries or in an occupied space         Node newNodeparentNode.cost  HeuristicparentNode.posX  offsetX, parentNode.posY  offsetY, target, parentNode.posX  offsetX, parentNode.posY  offsetY, ampparentNode         if the Node already exists on open or closed with a lower score, we can skip to the next neighbor         if the Node already exists on open or closed with a higher score, then we need to remove it         the erasing is somewhat expensive, but simplifies the implementation         forstdlistltNodegtiterator itr  closed.begin itr  closed.end itr             ifitr lt newNode                 skip  1                 break                          else ifitr  newNode                 closed.eraseitr                 break                               ifskip continue         forstdvectorltNodegtiterator itr  openVec.begin itr  openVec.end itr             ifitr lt newNode                 skip  1                 break                          else ifitr  newNode                 openVec.eraseitr                 break                               ifskip continue         open.pushnewNode       int Heuristicint posX, int posY, const Nodeamp target     return absposX  target.posX  absposY  target.posY  codepre  pBy inspection, closed and open contain the correct results.

Negative 248 pas ECMAScriptv5, each time when control enters a code, the enginge creates a strongLexicalEnvironmentstrongLE and a strongVariableEnvironmentstrongVE, for strongfunction codestrong, these 2 objects are exactly the same reference which is the result of calling NewDeclarativeEnvironmenta hrefhttpecma2625.comELS5HTML.htmSection10.4.3ECMAScript v5 10.4.3a, and all variables declared in strongfunction codestrong are stored in the strongenvironment recordstrong componentof strongVariableEnvironmentstronga hrefhttpecma2625.comELS5HTML.htmSection10.5ECMAScript v5 10.5a, and this is strongthe basic concept for closurestrong.p  pWhat confused me is how strongGarbage Collectstrong works with this closure approach, suppose I have code likep  precodefunction f1      var o  LargeObject.fromSize10MB     return function           here never uses o         return Hello world       var f2  f1 codepre  pafter the line codevar f2  f1code, our object graph would bep  precodeglobal gt f2 gt f2s VariableEnvironment gt f1s VariableEnvironment gt o codepre  pso as from my little knowledge, if the javascript engine uses a strongreference counting methodstrong for garbage collection, the object codeocode has at lease strong1 refenrencestrong and would never be GCed. Appearently this would result a waste of memory since codeocode would never be used but is always stored in memory.p  pSomeone may said the engine knows that strongf2s VariableEnvironmentstrong doesnt use strongf1s VariableEnvironmentstrong, so the entire strongf1s VariableEnvironmentstrong would be GCed, so there is another code snippet which may lead to more complex situationp  precodefunction f1      var o1  LargeObject.fromSize10MB     var o2  LargeObject.fromSize10MB     return function          alerto1       var f2  f1 codepre  pin this case, codef2code uses the codeo1code object which stores in strongf1s VariableEnvironmentstrong, so strongf2s VariableEnvironmentstrong must keep a reference to strongf1s VariableEnvironmentstrong, which result that codeo2code cannot be GCed as well, which further result in a waste of memory.p  pso I would ask, how modern javascript engine JScript.dll  V8  SpiderMonkey ... handles such situation, is there a standard specified rule or is it implementation based, and what is the exact step javascript engine handles such object graph when executing Garbage Collection.p  pThanks.p

Negative 248 pSo I have qTip2 working succesffuly, displaying the tooltip as a modal for some ajax content.  Everything is working great, except the content within the modal tooltip has links that also call another tooltip.  When I click any of those, the positioning goes way off screen like 234.5px and 300px.p  pI know it has something to do with the position parameters, but I cant get it to work.  Could I make it use the target of the previously clicked tooltip as its position  Or is there a way to load the new ajax content in the same tooltipp  plink on main pagep  precodelta classqtipajaxmodal id[id here] href[link here]      rel[ajax link here]gtMain Linkltagt codepre  plink within ajax pulled contentp  precodelta classqtipajaxmodal id[id here] href[link here]      rel[ajax link to somewhere else here]gtAnother Linkltagt codepre  pqTip codep  precode Make sure to only match links to wikipedia with a rel tag        a.qtipajaxmodal.livemouseover, function              Make sure to only apply one tooltip per element             if this.dataqtip  object  return              this.qtip             id modal2,              content               text ltdiv classajaxqtipmodalload altLoading...gtltdivgt,                 ajax                     url this.attrrel                  ,                 title                     text Title    this.text,                     button true                               ,               events                   show functionevent, api                        Grab the tooltip element from the API                      var tooltip  api.elements.tooltip                       ...and heres the extra event binds                      tooltip.find.uitooltiptitlebar.show                   ,                   hide functionevent, api                       api.destroy                                    ,              position                   target main,                  container main,                  my center,  ...at the center of the viewport                  at center,                  viewport container,                  effect false              ,              show                  event click,                 solo true,  Only show one tooltip at a time                 modal true,                 effect functionoffset                      this.show400  this refers to the tooltip                   ...and make it modal               ,              hide false,              style                  classes uitooltipfdmovie                        .clickfunctionevent  event.preventDefault         [code] codepre

Negative 248 pI just did a fresh installation of GWTGoogle Web Toolkit using Netbeans and GWT4NB plugin. Im also using Glassfish server 3.1. After everything was done I started my server, restarted Netbeans and created a new GWT project like one normally would.p  pThe packages and files gets automatically created like it normally should like the default Hello, GWT and button .java file. I cleaned and built the project and then deployed it to the server.p  pWhen I run the project my browser opens with just a blank screen, without displaying the Hello, GWT message.p  pIs there something I missedp

Negative 248 pI have a windows batch script that gets the PATH environment variable, checks if it has some value in it, and then sets it back. For examplep  precodeSET CURRPATHPATH  do some stuff to check for a value in CURRPATH and add the value in if it is not in there setx PATH PATH codepre  pThis works, but the problem is that something else I installed previously created a stronguserstrong system environment variable named PATH. When I access the PATH variable in my batch script, it concatenates both the user environment variable PATH and the machine environment variable PATH. Everytime I run the script the user variable PATH gets appended to the machine environment variable. Is there a way to just access the machine environment variable  p  pWhile I could simply remove the user environment variable PATH, this is not a good general solution since I cannot guarantee if the people running the script will have this same issue.p  pNote this seems to be specific to the PATH variablep

I found using an Eclipse Console better as it offers more choices and some functionality already baked into it.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Spring Source has just released a framework called strongspringshellstrong to make building console shell applications easier. It forks from the strongRoostrong source code, and thus provides the same functionality as in strongRoostrong.p

This is not what i want to do because i am using the Nexus repository locally. When using Nexus, all requests should be going through nexus so i dont need to configure the proxy via the Maven configuration file. p  pI have previously got it to work with the proxy configuration added via the Nexus GUI screen under Administration  Server  HTTP Proxy settings but for some reason it is not accepting it this time. p  pHere is my settings.xml file. p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  lt Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation ASF under one or more contributor license agreements.

User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,                    and is normally provided in user.home.m2settings.xml.                     NOTE This location can be overridden with the CLI option                     s pathtousersettings.xml      2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven                   users on a machine assuming theyre all using the same Maven                   installation. Its normally provided in                    maven.homeconfsettings.xml.                     NOTE This location can be overridden with the CLI option                     gs pathtoglobalsettings.xml     The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at   getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default   values values used when the setting is not specified are provided.    gt ltsettings xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgSETTINGS1.0.0            xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance            xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgSETTINGS1.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgxsdsettings1.0.0.xsdgt   lt localRepository     The path to the local repository maven will use to store artifacts.         Default .m2repository   ltlocalRepositorygtpathtolocalrepoltlocalRepositorygt   gt    lt interactiveMode     This will determine whether maven prompts you when it needs input. If set to false,     maven will use a sensible default value, perhaps based on some other setting, for     the parameter in question.         Default true   ltinteractiveModegttrueltinteractiveModegt   gt    lt offline     Determines whether maven should attempt to connect to the network when executing a build.     This will have an effect on artifact downloads, artifact deployment, and others.         Default false   ltofflinegtfalseltofflinegt   gt    lt pluginGroups     This is a list of additional group identifiers that will be searched when resolving plugins by their prefix, i.e.     when invoking a command line like mvn prefixgoal. Maven will automatically add the group identifiers     org.apache.maven.plugins and org.codehaus.mojo if these are not already contained in the list.    gt   ltpluginGroupsgt     lt pluginGroup       Specifies a further group identifier to use for plugin lookup.     ltpluginGroupgtcom.your.pluginsltpluginGroupgt     gt   ltpluginGroupsgt    lt proxies     This is a list of proxies which can be used on this machine to connect to the network.     Unless otherwise specified by system property or commandline switch, the first proxy     specification in this list marked as active will be used.    gt   ltproxiesgt     lt proxy       Specification for one proxy, to be used in connecting to the network.           ltproxygt       ltidgtoptionalltidgt       ltactivegttrueltactivegt       ltprotocolgthttpltprotocolgt       ltusernamegtproxyuserltusernamegt       ltpasswordgtproxypassltpasswordgt       lthostgtmyProxy.local.comlthostgt       ltportgt8080ltportgt       ltnonProxyHostsgtlocal.netsome.host.comltnonProxyHostsgt     ltproxygt     gt   ltproxiesgt    lt servers     This is a list of authentication profiles, keyed by the serverid used within the system.     Authentication profiles can be used whenever maven must make a connection to a remote server.    gt   ltserversgt     lt server       Specifies the authentication information to use when connecting to a particular server, identified by       a unique name within the system referred to by the id attribute below.              NOTE You should either specify usernamepassword OR privateKeypassphrase, since these pairings are              used together.      gt         lt Another sample, using keys to authenticate.     ltservergt       ltidgtsiteServerltidgt       ltprivateKeygtpathtoprivatekeyltprivateKeygt       ltpassphrasegtoptional leave empty if not used.ltpassphrasegt     ltservergt     gt   ltserversgt    lt mirrors     This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.          It works like this a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.     However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored     it to several places.         That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that     repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred      server for that repository.    gt   ltmirrorsgt     lt mirror       Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that       this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used       for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.           ltmirrorgt       ltidgtmirrorIdltidgt       ltmirrorOfgtrepositoryIdltmirrorOfgt       ltnamegtHuman Readable Name for this Mirror.ltnamegt       lturlgthttpmy.repository.comrepopathlturlgt     ltmirrorgt      gt      ltmirrorgt             ltThis sends everything else to public gt             ltidgtnexusltidgt             ltmirrorOfgtltmirrorOfgt             lturlgthttplocalhost8280nexuscontentgroupspubliclturlgt     ltmirrorgt   ltmirrorsgt    lt profiles     This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify     the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine     specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.         For example, if you have an integration testing plugin  like cactus  that needs to know where     your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is      dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.         As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way  the activeProfiles     section of this document settings.xml  will be discussed later. Another way essentially     relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,     or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a      value of 1.4 might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of 1.4.207.     Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.         NOTE For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact           repositories, plugin repositories, and freeform properties to be used as configuration           variables for plugins in the POM.        gt   ltprofilesgt     lt profile       Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the       mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via ltactivatedProfilesgt       or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.             An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention       for profiles, such as envdev, envtest, envproduction, userjdcasey, userbrett, etc.       This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting       to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile ids for debug.             This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDKspecific repo.     ltprofilegt       ltidgtjdk1.4ltidgt        ltactivationgt         ltjdkgt1.4ltjdkgt       ltactivationgt        ltrepositoriesgt         ltrepositorygt           ltidgtjdk14ltidgt           ltnamegtRepository for JDK 1.4 buildsltnamegt           lturlgthttpwww.myhost.commavenjdk14lturlgt           ltlayoutgtdefaultltlayoutgt           ltsnapshotPolicygtalwaysltsnapshotPolicygt         ltrepositorygt       ltrepositoriesgt     ltprofilegt     gt      lt       Here is another profile, activated by the system property targetenv with a value of dev,       which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance.

Negative 248 pstrongEditstrong Answer is below.  codeself.progress.updateidletaskscode was the secret handshake to have the progress bar update.  Thanks mgilson.p  pI am currently working with some somewhat large csv files sometimes up to 700Mb, and it takes a while pulling from a network drive.  I would like to be able to give the user some feed back as the the status of the process.  This led me to the ttk statusbar. I have looked at as many examples as I could find, and then tried to apply them to my program with no success.  I think my problem is that I am using a codeforcode loop to read my csv file, but that might not be the issue.  I dont know.  Below is an example of how my code works.p  precodeimport csv import Tkinter as tk import ttk  class MAINtk.Frame     def initself, master, args, kwargs         n0         self.filename  some.csv         tk.Frame.initself, args, kwargs         frametk.Framemaster, kwargs         frame.grid         getdata  tk.Buttonframe, textGet Data, commandself.csvget         getdata.gridrown         n1         self.progress  ttk.Progressbarframe, orienthorizontal,                                         length 200, modedeterminate         self.progress.gridrown     def progself         self.progress[value]0         try fopenself.filename, rb         except return         read  csv.readerf, delimiter,         self.maxrows0         for row in read self.maxrows1         self.progress[maximum]self.maxrows     def csvgetself         try fopenself.filename, rb         except return         read  csv.readerf, delimiter,         q0         for row in read             if q1000 self.progress[value]q             elif qself.maxrows self.progress[value]q             ... do some stuff read into lists etc....  roottk.Tk appMAINroot app.mainloop codepre  pWell that turned out longer than I expected.  I know I am reading the file twice. I couldnt figure out how to get the length of the csv file any other way, if you have a solution for this I am all ears.  But the main thrust of of my question remains how do I get the progress bar to work.  In its current configuration it goes from zero to full instantly as soon as the file is done reading.  Suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrong My code has gotten much better with mgilsons help.  However my status bar still does not update while the file.  I have tried the followingp  precodeself.completed  tk.IntVar self.completed.set0 self.progress  ttk.Progressbarself.frame, orienthorizontal, length200,                    modedeterminate, maximum100, variableself.completed in the function now fsize  os.path.getsizeself.filename for r,row in enumerateread     qfloatf.tellfloatfsize100      if r100 0         self.completed.setq codepre  pAlso rather than just calling codeself.completedcode I made a codedefcode that took codeqcode as an input and then put it into codeself.completedcode.  Also rather than using codeself.completedcode I got rid of the codevariablecode kwarg in codeself.progresscode and went back to calling the kwarg value in both directly and through the codedefcode.  Also attempted was codeself.progress.configurevalue  qcode and it behaves just as the others.p  pAll of these tries only refresh the bar after the file has completed.p  pIf I modify the bars status before the codeforcode loop where the data is read but in the same codedefcode the bar does not get updated until the file is done reading.  I tried to set it to 50 as an experiment, it went from none to 100 as soon as the file completed.p

Negative 248 pstrongShort versionstrongp  pLooking for suggestions to somehow distribute a filtered resource file containing common copyright info, project name, version, inceptionYear and currentYear, to multiple projects using something that doesnt give errors when used from Eclipse with the m2e plugin.p  pstrongDescriptionstrongp  pRight now, we have a project, buildInfo, containing a propertiesfile with stuff like project .name, project.version, inceptionYear, currentYear.p  pWe have a parent.pom that does the followingp  ul lidefines the currentYear property using the buildhelpermavenplugintimestampproperty goalli liunpacks the buildInfo propertiesfile to the project.build.directorybuildInfoproject.artifactId using the dependencyunpack goal.li licopy and filters the propertiesfile to targetclasses using the resourcescopyresources goal.li ul  pAll projects inheriting from the parent.pom now gets a copy of the propertyfile, which is filtered with that projects specific name, version and inception year.p  pThis is then used in each project to dump a copyright notice to the log when the project is initialized. Specifically, that project knows that its propertyfiles lives in a subfolder named after the project.p  pstrongWhystrongp  pTo remove duplication of the propertyfile in each project that needs to dump copyright and version information we have put the property file in its own project.p  pWe could not find any other way to look up the correct propertyfile, than to put it in a uniquely named folder for each project.p  pWe build applications reusing lots of these projects, which means we need to find this information in many different jar files, so the namepath of the propertyfile needs to be unique.p  pstrongProblemsstrongp  pThe Eclipse m2eplugin does not like the dependencyunpack and the buildhelpermavenplugintimestampproperty goals.p  pWhen checking out a project as a maven project using the m2eplugin, it marks the pomfiles inheriting from our parent.pom as having errors.p  ul liWe moved the execution of the two goals to the package phase, which should be m2e noninteresting phase, but still gets errors see a hrefhttpsdocs.sonatype.orgdisplayM2ECLIPSEProjectbuildlifecyclemapping relnofollowhttpsdocs.sonatype.orgdisplayM2ECLIPSEProjectbuildlifecyclemappinga.li liWe have added the lifecyclemapping plugin with configuration to ignore the timestampproperty goal, but it annoyingly still gives an error at checkout, which then disappears after the checkout.li liWe have also added configuration to ignore the unpack goal.li ul  pWith all three changes, it seems to work. Unfortunately, when running the projects from Eclipse, we no longer have the propertyfile...p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pAll this was done to remove duplication and to avoid the need to commit a filechange for each release,.p  pAnnoyingly, our solution still require that we know which projects an application consist of to read the information from each jar and present in an Aboutbox.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow would you suggest adding common information to multiple projects that is used in an application, and be able to look it up for each of the jar filesp  pAnd, can it be done with maven in a m2efriendly wayp  pLooking forward to suggestions,br Henrikp

Negative 248 pBackgroundp  pI am attempting to write an exercise for Khan Academy. Their code is all available here a hrefhttpsgithub.comKhankhanexercises relnofollowhttpsgithub.comKhankhanexercisesa.  This is my first time really programming anything, and I am learning html and js as I go basically just by looking at example code. p  pAs part of this exercise I need to draw a random function, and find its zeros.  I have written a zero finding algorithm Cutting an interval in half repeatedly to zoom in on the zero..  I know some variant of newtons method is probably faster, but I wanted to insure convergence.  My random function takes a set of points values and interpolates those points with a polynomial spline. Each of these work independently I can graph my random function and I can use my zero finding algorithm to, say, approximate the square root of 2 zero of x2  2 on interval 1,2.  When I try to find zeros of my random function I run into trouble  My browser goes into an infinite loop or something.

Negative 248 pI need to use Android tablet or smartphone to connect a specialized device through RJ45 in the open location, without additional power and probably under bad weather. The device supports HTTP and has RJ45 connector. There is no wireless support.

Unfortunately all these instructions are clearly for the rooted device. Has anybody ever succeeded to get RJ45 to USB adapter working on a nonrooted Android device, and with which exactly hardwarep  pI have tried on two devices, Galaxy Nexus Android 4.1.2, kernel 3.0.31 and ThinkPad tablet Android 4.0.3, kernel 2.6.39. Galaxy Nexus has USB OTG that works for devices like desktop mouse and ThinkPad even features the full size USB Host ports that also works. So yes, there is the tested and working USB host support.p  pI have tried multiple USB to Ethernet converters, including Apple Mac converter, DLink DUB E100SMC2209USBETH and some others. Some of these converters work fine even on handhelds running QTopia, but none works with my two Android devices. The converters are somwhat alive with they LEDs flashing but seem not attempting any DHCP or the like. I also tried to write the driver using Android USB host API but seems not very trivial. p  pstrongUpdatestrong I have just disovered that ASIX provides as is nothing drivers for they converter devices, claiming that these drivers should work also for Android high versions including, see a hrefhttpwww.asix.com.twproducts.phpoppItemdetailampPItemID13471100ampPLine71herea for instance. p  pstrongUpdatestrong Android kernel 3.0.31 seems containing the whole bunch of various USB to RJ45 converter drivers, with many of them active by default.

Negative 248 pOk this is my first post, and I am still VERY new at Xcode and Objective C. Ive been self teaching myself for the past few weeks. Anyways, Im practicing by making a small game where you control a helicopter and collect coins that drop. I have been having some trouble with the object collision method though. The biggest problem is that after successful collision the Helicopter will automatically be moved back to its starting location, which I do not want. I want the Helicopter UIImage to stay in its new location. I have checked every line of my code and no where do I call to recreate the Helicopter.frame in its original position.p  precodevoidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      UITouch UserMoveTouch  [touches anyObject]     CGPoint pos  [UserMoveTouch locationInView self.view]     ifpos.xlt356              [UIView beginAnimationsCopterMoveTo contextNULL]         [UIView setAnimationDuration .5]         [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentStateYES]          CopterPlayer.center  [UserMoveTouch locationInViewself.view]          [UIView setAnimationDelegateself]         [UIView setAnimationCurveUIViewAnimationCurveEaseOut]         [UIView commitAnimations]         voidCopterCollisionCheck      ifCGRectIntersectsRectCoin1.frame, CopterPlayer.frame              SystemSoundID soundID         NSString CoinSound[[NSBundle mainBundle]                              pathForResourceGetCoin ofTypewav]         AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundIDbridge CFURLRef                                          [NSURL fileURLWithPathCoinSound], amp soundID         AudioServicesPlaySystemSoundsoundID         Coin1.frameCGRectMakeCoin1.center.x150,15,20,23         if MultiplierX1                      ScoreValueScoreValue1                  else ifMultiplierX2                      ScoreValueScoreValue2                  else ifMultiplierX3                      ScoreValueScoreValue3                   ScoreValueLabel.text  [NSString stringWithFormatd,ScoreValue]      voidCopterCollisionTimer      [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval0.35 targetself                 selectorselectorCopterCollisionCheck userInfonil repeatsYES]  codepre  pI apologize if I forgot a bracket or something with the pasting of the code, not use to formatting posts on this site.

Negative 248 pCame across a curious problem. In our code the other day. Ive come up with a quick fix, but I couldnt help wondering if there was a better way of doing it.p  pThe problem comes when parsing the string values submitted via QueryString into typed objects that eventually end up in a SQL stored procedure. For most eventual comparison types, comparing strings is fine, but to do less than or greater than and the like with dates, the string has to be converted to a date first. p  pSo we were doing this  value is submitted into the function as a string after being pulled out of the querystringp  precodeif DateTime.TryParsevalue, out newTime      value  newTime.ToStringIsoUtc   return value codepre  pWhich worked fine for years, until someone tried to submit a threepart version number. Suddenly 1.3.1 became 20010301 and the comparison stopped working.p  pMy quick fix was just to check to see if there was more than one dot in the potential date and if so, leave it as a string. Easy. But the trouble is that while none of our clients currently use anything other than UTC date format, I got scared when I looked on Wikipedia and found how many countries use something like dd.mm.yy as a standard date format.p  pIs there a better way of telling an untyped version number from a datep

If it failed before this step, the CLR would not even load, so the very fact that it is probing and creating fusion logs leads me to belive it is because the CLR cant find ManagedCOMObject.dll.pli lipNote that the CLR is loaded  I believe this means that COM has successfully looked at the current activation context to find the registration. I dont know precisely what clrClass does in the manifest, but presumably it got the CLR loaded successfully.pli lipI assume now that the issue is the CLR is not paying attention to the ActCtx when loading assemblies. If I was writing managed code, I could hook into the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve event and find the DLL myself. Since instead im writing unmanaged code, and hosting the CLR only implicitly, can I somehow change my applications PrivatePath andor how assemblies are probedpli ol

Negative 248 pWe have been developing a product for 2 months now and it has a high rate of unit test coverage. Most of us are also writing our tests first and code after. This means that we can trust our tests since we use the red first, green later approach.p  pTo date, we have demoed our functionality to the customer by hand. However, as we begin to cover more and more requirements it has become necessary for us to cover these requirements using function tests. p  pAt the moment we have no function tests.p  pWe have a team member who handles requirements and I believe he would be a good person to write the function tests.

Negative 248 pI am programming a gateway which one of the functionality is to destroy connections when enough packets have been exchanged. I would like to know how to properly form RST packets to send to both the client and server to terminate the connection.p  pTo test this, I use ftp connectionssessions. Right now, I am seeing that when I send the RST packets, the client endlessly replies with SYN packets, while the server simply continues the datastream with ACK packets. Note that after I decide to destroy the connection, I block the traffic between both ends.p  pI am thinking there may be something wrong with the way I handle my SEQ and ACK numbers. I have not been able to find ressources to explain what to do with the SEQ and ACK numbers when sending a RST packet specifically. Right now, I set the SEQ to a new random number with rand and set the ACK to 0 since I am not using the ACK flag. I invert the source address with destination address and source port with destination port, and have seen that I correctly calculate checksums.p  pI seems like both the client and server do not accept the termination.p

Negative 248 pMy Eclipse seems to have corrupted itselfmy project. I renamed the ids of some TextViews in the XML and it changed the ids of some other TextViews in other XML files, causing many null pointer exceptions. When I try to rename them, the change the the new name, but then jump to something completely random which already exists. It has completely broken my project so Ill have to start afresh, however does anybody know what could have caused thisp  pThanksp  pEDIT As I am editing IDs, it would appear that some elements are sharing an ID. Everytime I change one, it changes the other one. I think this is because Eclipse generates TextViews and calls them TextView01 etc.. and its linked all the ones it called TextView01 together. Now whenever I edit one of them, it changes the other...p  pHow can I fix thisp

Negative 248 pWhat Im trying to do is get a segment of a large String. I have tried using indexOf, but that fails completely when it comes to repeated text. My end goal is for a user to be able to select text in a JTextPane and stylize only that portion of text. Ive already gotten the styling to work with StyledDocuments and Ive even gotten it to style only text that the user selects but heres my problem.p  pLets say that p  blockquote   pString alltext  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogp blockquote  pAnd what the user highlights is codeString selectedtextcodep  pIn this case, lets just sayp  blockquote   pString selectedtext  brownp blockquote  pMy goal is to get the offset and length of the selected text.

Negative 248 pEclipse was developed using Java 6, so using the latest stable release of Java 6...p  pUnder which OS eg. Windows 7, Funduntu, Ubuntu or MacOSX is Eclipse most robustp  pReason for questionp  pI, like many other people, consider Eclipse to be the best IDE to develop android applications. However, that doesnt mean that its very good. I think that the reason that it isnt very good is because it has been developed to be compatible with as many system setups as possible. Its an impossible task. In fact, finding a single setup that works flawlessly is proving very difficult, but I WILL find at least one.p  pEditp  pIt appears that the different OSs have never been compared before, so I will test over the next few weeks and report my findings back here.p

Negative 248 pI have an iOS Universal app that uses a standard codeUISplitViewControllercode.p  pAlmost since I started working on the app I had the following code in place to link the master view controller on the left with the detail view controller on the rightp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.detailViewController  CustomViewController [[self.splitViewController.viewControllers lastObject] topViewController]  codepre  pAfter some recent changes the last line stopped working and thus broke some functionality. The reason for this behavior is that codeself.splitViewControllercode is codenilcode at this point. Moving the last line to codeviewWillAppearcode fixes the problem, but IMHO this isnt the completely right spot.p  pThe changes I made arent really related to this, I didnt made changes to the controller hierarchy or the storyboard I use. So I cant explain where this behavior originates from. Any hint would be appreciated.p
Negative 248 pYes, its been asked before, but every answer I come up with on SO and elsewhere has to do with compiling C code in gcc instead of g, or a issue of some kind with standard libraries.

Negative 248 pI dont quite know if my question fits here, but I dont know who else to ask...p  pI recently upgraded my socialengine plugin, which should allow me login to my site via Facebook. The reason I had to upgrade it because it didnt work anymore since Facebook changed the API APIKEY  APPID. I think this was around 2010p  pNow I bought the latest version of the plugin, just to find out that it still requires an APIKEY. Their support told me that its not supported anymore because the version of my CMS is not supported anymore nice to find that out after paying for it.

For Example To code a button on a web page that can change the value of a data point from 1 to 0, which triggers an action on the device that is connected towith this Feed. i.e to compose a request directly in a browser to obtain the desired effect..

Negative 248 pIm developing a game in Java which I can only describe as a variant of The Sims.p  pThe main interface for the game consists of a level and will have a large variety of furniture which can be placed on the map. My problem is that whilst I can think of ways to construct a system which will allow me to assign properties to each item of furniture, I want to make sure I do it the correct way before I head down a long path to completing it. For example, if I referenced an object with an identifier of sofa, the furniture objects members could be accessed through searching through all available objects and finding the one with the matching identifier.p  pMy method would be to make a very large .java file with instances from a base furniture class for each item of furniture, with each one having an identifier and all its different properties assigned, such as image, position, rotation etc, plus their own unique code for each different function they provide eg. sitting, sleeping.p  pFor savingstoring these objects in a text file, I would just store the name of the identifier in the string array in the text file and when loading, I could just create the object by instantiating the object the identifier points to.p  pWould I be correct in using most of these methods, or are better ones available If youve found it a struggle to comprehend what Ive written and I had trouble writing it clearly, then a more simple question would bep  pHow are items of furniture managed in The Sims with respect to the sheer amount available and the many different variationsrotations they can be placed in and storedsavedp

Negative 248 pmy problem is as followsp  pIm trying to add functionality to an HTML editor which is implemented in Java Swing using HTMLEditorKit and HTMLDocument classes. The idea is to provide a possibility to switch between different styles during editing of the text in the HTML editor. The different styles define backgroundforeground colors, fonts and the like.p  pI already managed to load a stylesheet file programmatically. The code for that looks as followsp  precodeclass HtmlEditor extends JFrame implements Keylistener, MouseListener   private HTMLDocument  mdoc  private HTMLEditorKit mkit  [...]   public HtmlEditor...       [...]     final URL formats  HtmlEditor.class.getResourceformats.css predefStyles  new StyleSheet predefStyles.importStyleSheetformats mkit.getStyleSheet.addStyleSheetpredefStyles      [...]  codepre  pThe style sheet file looks as followsp  precode.style1  backgroundcolorsilver  .style2  backgroundcoloraqua  .style3  backgroundcolorteal  codepre  pWith that style sheet added to the HTMLEditorKit instances StyleSheet I can already use the styles when inserting content into the HTML editor using its source editor in the source editor one can insert HTML code directly, e.g. ltspan classstyle1gtStyled textltspangt. To allow for use of the styles in the WYSIWYG part too I added a JComboBox into the Editors toolbar which displays the names of the styles from the formats.css the leading . from the style names is removed. In the JComboBoxs ActionListener Im now trying to set the class attribute. My code looks as followsp  precode    cbStyles  new JComboBoxltStringgtgetStyleNames     cbStyles.setToolTipTextSelect Style     cbStyles.setMaximumSizenull     cbStyles.addActionListenernew ActionListener           Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              currStyle  cbStyles.getSelectedItem.toString              final SimpleAttributeSet attr  new SimpleAttributeSet             attr.addAttributeHTML.Attribute.CLASS, currStyle             mkit.getInputAttributes.addAttributesattr             meditor.requestFocusInWindow                   mtoolBar.addcbStyles codepre  pUnfortunately this does not seem to function. At least, after changing the style I do not get it applied to the text Im entering afterwards and in the source view the class attribute does not appear in the containing HTML component. I inspected the code in the HtmlEditor class that manages setting another font to see if I can use the same technique that is used for chaning the font for my purpose too. The respective action listener attached to the JComboBox that provides font selection looks as followsp  precode        cbFonts.addActionListenernew ActionListener          Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              mfontName  mcbFonts.getSelectedItem.toString             final MutableAttributeSet attr  new SimpleAttributeSet             StyleConstants.setFontFamilyattr, mfontName             mkit.getInputAttributes.addAttributesattr             meditor.requestFocusInWindow               codepre  pAs we can see here the class StyleConstants is used to set the attribute to the new font. Whats puzzling me is that the StyleConstants class does not seem to provide a method for setting a class attribute. As can be seen in its Javadoc there are numerous methods for setting attributes like alignment, font family, boldness, etc. Possibly my approach is incorrect in a quite simple way. Maybe I did not yet properly understand the concepts of using CSS in an HTMLDocument. Any help would be appreciatedp  pFrom my understanding in HTML CSS can be used as followsp  pA ltstyle element inside the lthead part defines style classes. Examplep  precodeltstyle typetextcssgt .style1  backgroundcolorsilver  .style2  backgroundcoloraqua  .style3  backgroundcolorteal  ltstylegt codepre  pThen inside the HTML  these classes can be referenced through the universal attribute class inside of HTML elements. Examplep  pltspan classstyle1Text in style1ltspanp  pSo it should be possible somehow to insert the class attribute with a predefined style as its value into an element in an HTMLDocument that is managed by an HTMLEditorKit. My little HTML editor is to provide functionality to activate a style at a current caret position inside the document.  So lets assume the caret position is inside a paragraph like thisp  pltpSome text without style ltpp  pafter the word style before the closing paragraph tag.p  pNow I want to activate, lets say, style1. This should then result in a structure like the followingp  pltpSome text without styleltspan classstyle1 ltspanltpp  pAnd the caret position now should be inside the new ltspan element.p  pOr if caret were at the beginning of an empty paragraphp  pltpltpp  pafter applying a style the structure should look as followsp  pltp classstyle1 ltpp  pI assume that this should be no big deal but have no clue how to get this done.p  pIn between I tried another way to solve my problem but with no success.

Negative 248 pI havent found anything in the documentation about this, only generic bla about default values. My assumption was that it should work like thisp  precodeenum MyEnum     UNSPECIFIED,    SPECIFIED   record Test     MyEnum e  UNSPECIFIED  codepre  pThe GenericDatumReader in Java unfortunately complains that he is finding a String but expects a MyEnum.p  pCan anyone confirm that this is the correct way to use a enum with a default value using avro IDL In that case I have a bug elsewhere. Can anyone confirm that this is not the way to do it and correct me Any input is appreciatedp  pUpdate In my real world version of this, it seems that a newly added enum to the record is causing the issue even though it has a default value. This means that my reader schema expects an enum, whereas the record does not contain one. Schema evolution should be able to resolve this, but seems to fail.

Negative 248 pI have found a fair bit of information on what happens when a trigger fails, but have not been able to find any on what happens when the transaction fails.p  pLets assume I have two tables, table A and table B.  I have defined a BEFORE INSERT trigger such that an insert on table A will cause the trigger to update table B.  I understand that if the trigger fails, the insert transaction will not be executed.  What happens when the trigger executes successfully and then the insert fails  Will the update on table B be rolled backp  pTaking this a step further, lets say I have also defined table C and a BEFORE UPDATE trigger such that an update on table B will cause the trigger to update table C.  The intended behaviour when all works well is such that when a row is inserted into table A, a trigger will update table B which will cause another trigger to update table C.  Since both are BEFORE triggers, these operations would be executed in reverse, as in table C will be updated first, then B, then the insert will be performed on A.  What happens when the insert on A fails  Will the updates on both B and C be rolled backp

Negative 248 pFor my master thesis Im investigating the possibility to use an NFC enabled phone for opening offline door locks. These locks currently work with DESFire cards which contains authorisation data. Furthermore, the card is also used to update configurations and obtain maintenance messages tofrom the lock. The goal is to update and read this information tofrom the lock via an application on the phone that communicates with an external server over the internet ultimately making the exchange of this information more efficient.p  pCurrently, I think the best choice for getting card emulation to work is to use an SD card with NFC and a secure element. This provides two possibilitiesp  p1 A possibility is to implement a custom made java card applet that emulates a DESFire card. Theoretically, this should be feasible as DESFire cards optionally supports APDUs ISO7816. p  p2 Some of the NFC SD cards available on the market offer DESFire emulation as a ROM.p  pIve the following questionsp  ul lipFor option 1 I wonder what will happen if the offline lock  reader initiates communication using DESFire native commands instead of APDUs. Is it possible to interpret nonAPDU commands from java card If not, it probably means it will not workpli lipIs it possible to manage the content of an emulated DESFire card in option 2 The NFC SD cards that I saw provides a proprietary API to access the secure element. It allows this by transceiving APDUs. The emulated DESFire, however, is not a java card applet in this case but it is a ROM which may or may not support this communication with APDUs.pli ul  pI know this question is not strictly related to programming. But I found that there are quite some people on stackoverflow with expertise on NFC related topics. In fact, I found most of my information here.p  pThanksp
Negative 248 pI just noticed an strange regression when debugging using vs.net 2010.p  pSuppose I have the following codep  precodeint a  1 int b  2  if a gt b      codepre  pWhen debugging under visual studio 2008, if I mouse over the a variable, it would show me the value.

This is awesomep  pThe problem Im having now is that it doesnt work anymore on visual studio 2010. Is this intended or is there any configuration I should do to make it workp  pThanks in advance for any hint.p

Negative 248 pA prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous part of S. For example, c and cod are prefixes of the string codility. For simplicity, we require prefixes to be nonempty. The product of prefix P of string S is the number of occurrences of P multiplied by the length of P. More precisely, if prefix P consists of K characters and P occurs exactly T times in S, then the product equals K  T. For example, S  abababa has the following prefixesp  precodea, whose product equals 1  4  4, ab, whose product equals 2  3  6, aba, whose product equals 3  3  9, abab, whose product equals 4  2  8, ababa, whose product equals 5  2  10, ababab, whose product equals 6  1  6, abababa, whose product equals 7  1  7. codepre  pThe longest prefix is identical to the original string. The goal is to choose such a prefix as maximizes the value of the product. In above example the maximal product is 10.

For example, for a stringp  precodeS  abababa the function should return 10, as explained above, S  aaa the function should return 4, as the product of the prefix aa is maximal. codepre  pAssume thatp  precodeN is an integer within the range [1..300,000] string S consists only of lowercase letters az. codepre  pComplexityp  precodeexpected worstcase time complexity is ON expected worstcase space complexity is ON not counting the storage required for input arguments. codepre  pMy code so farp  precodefunction solutionS      PROD  0     for i1 i lt strlenS i         p  substrS, 0, i         counter  0         offset  0         pos  strposS, p, offset         whilepos  false               counter             offset  pos  1                         pos  strposS, p, offset                  if PROD lt counter  strlenp             PROD  counter  strlenp             if PROD gt 1000000000                 return 1000000000                   return PROD  codepre  pis there any way to do it more faster p

Negative 248 pI am trying to compile my project for use of debugging with gprof however, I am having numerous issues.p  pRight now, I am trying to create a separate target in my makefile that is gprof which depends upon the executable. This target, beforehand, adds the flags g gdwarf3 and pg to the compilation flags and pg to the linker flags.p  pThe unfortunate thing is I cannot get gprof to run successfully, as my compiled binary doesnt produce the required gmon.out. There are also side issues regarding this process.p  p1. I am getting an issue regarding a clang warning when trying to introduce gdwarf3 flags. This issue is codeclang warning argument unused during compilation gdwarf3code.p  p2. The makefiles 3 of them, one main, one more main executable, and one for linked library were produced by premake. I have edited them to introduce compiler and linker flags.p  p3. I dont know how to compile the linked library vecmath under gprof do I even need to. The ar command doesnt accept the necessary pg flag needed for gprof.p  pI am trying to perform this on a macbook air 2011, MAC OSX 10.8. I will try to attempt this later in linux.p  pMy three makefiles are shared a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshfectp30kq7ukz37mcPIwDB9wP relnofollowherea.

Negative 248 pMost of the examples of generics and wildcards involve collections but I am trying to learn how to use them just with classes.  I want to learn this more modern approach of generics so that I can avoid the awkward casting that comes about when the subclass overrides a method from the superclass.p  pI have an abstract class for a guessing game that could potentially be used for a number guessing game, a word guessing game, or even Mastermind.  Included in the games package are abstract classes for Level and Score.  I would then like to subclass the guessing game and subclass the level and the score in order to make a specific game.p  pHere is the abstract class for Scorep  precode a score is a measure of how close a guess is to being correct public abstract class Score      public abstract boolean equalsClasslt extends Scoregt otherScore      public abstract boolean isWinClasslt extends Levelgt level   codepre  pIn writing the parameter for isWin, I was trying to say expect to get an argument of something that is either a Level or a subclass of Level.p  pI then made my subclass of Score for Mastermindp  precodepublic class MastermindScore extends games.Score     int numRightPlace     int numWrongPlace       public MastermindScoreint numRightPlace, int numWrongPlace             this.numRightPlace  numRightPlace             this.numWrongPlace  numWrongPlace           public boolean equalsMastermindScore otherScore             if this.numRightPlaceotherScore.numRightPlace                     if this.numWrongPlace  otherScore.numWrongPlace                             return true                                               return false           public boolean isWinMastermindLevel level             return this.numRightPlace  level.numSlots      codepre  pThis does not compile because it believes that I have not correctly overridden the methods required by the abstract superclass.  So, even though the subclass isWin method has a parameter that is a subclass of Level, it doesnt recognize that as the expected type.p  pI then changed the class declaration line for the subclass of Level to look like thisp  precodepublic class MastermindLevelltT extends games.Levelgt      public final int numColors     public final int numSlots       public MastermindLevelint numColors, int numSlots, int maxGuesses             supermaxGuesses             this.numColors  numColors             this.numSlots  numSlots       codepre  pHowever, when I do this, the call to the superclass constructor does not work because it believes my class to be a subclass of Object, not a subclass of Level.p  pI know I can get the code to work by writing the overridden methods with parameters of the superclass and then casting Level and Score to MastermindLevel and MastermindScore, but I was hoping to learn howif this can be done with generics.  I really would like to understand generics more thoroughly.p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 248 pIn neural networks,for a given training pair of inputoutput values, weights are adjusted so that the mean squared error is minimized.But I do not have training data.I have a cost function that depends on a functions and I want to calculate that function using neural network.

For each of these inputs I get an output.Using all these scores I calculate some cost function. Now my task is to maximize that cost function. So in first iteration I will get some value of that cost function.Now I want to adjust the weights so that this cost is maximized. How can I do thatp  pI am working on information retrieval and the cost function I just mentioned here is the Mean Average PrecisionMAP.

Negative 248 pYesterday I asked a question regarding singletons and templates a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21148611metaprogrammingwithsingletonMeta programming with singletona, and that kicked off quite a debate about singleton use.  Im personally not a fan of them, but for my particular problem I cant figure out an alternative.  Id like to describe my problem and would love feedback on ways I can create a robust solution.p  pBackground The software Im working on has been around for 15 years and spans multiple exes and dlls its for Windows Ive been working on it for 6 months.p  pI have a class, Foo thats in a shared library.  Foo is an object with a very small lifetime 5 seconds, and can be created in any thread, any process, and at any time.  Im now extending Foo with new functionality, and a requirement is a function called FooInit must be run before any Foo objects can be executed, and FooDestroy when the process exits.p  pThe problem is, creation of Foo objects is arbitrary  any part of the code can, and does, callp  precodeFoo foo  new Foo codepre  pboostcallonce inside Foos ctor works for FooInit, but doesnt help me solve the problem of calling FooDestroy.  Referencing counting Foo doesnt help, because there may be [0,n] in memory at any one time with more to be created, so I cant call FooDestroy when the count gets to 0.p  pMy current solution is to create and use a FooManager singleton inside of Foos ctor.  The singleton will call FooInit, and at some time in the future FooDestroy will eventually be called.  Im leaning towards this solution because it appears to be the safest and lowest risk.p  pAny feedback is appreciated.p

Negative 248 pIm working on a couple of C11 work queue classes. The first class, commandqueue is a multi producer single consumer work queue. Multiple threads can post commands, and a single thread calls wait and popback in a loop to process those commands.p  pThe second class, Actor uses commandqueue and actually provides a consumer thread... besides that, the idea is that post will return a future so that clients can either block until the command is processed, or continue running actor also adds the idea of a result type. To implement this, Im attempting to store stdpromises in a stdpair in the work queue. I believe I am fairly close, but im having a problem in the entrypoint function below... specifically, when Im trying to get the stdpair out of the command queue Im getting a use of deleted function compiler error...

Negative 248 pHeres my requirement. There is a public website which takes alphanumeric string as input and Retrieves data into a table element via button click. The table element has couple of labels which gets populated with corresponding data. I need a toolsolution which can check if a particular string exists in the websites database. If so retrieve all the Ids of all the occurrences of that string. Looking at the view source of the website No JavaScript used there, I noted the input element name and the button element name and with the help of existing samples I was able to get a working solution. Below is the code which works but I want to check if there is any better and faster approach. I know the below code has some issues like infinite loop issue and others.

But in comparison to angular, batman does not gain from much support in the community see a hrefhttpwww.google.detrendsexploreqbatman.js,20angular.jsampcmptq relnofollowGoogle Trendsa for example.p  pSo my question is, is it possible to have the benefits of a batman.jsapp in an angularapplication with a little configuration Do you have any good links for a good railsintegrationp
Negative 248 pI created a simple project using WindowBuilder in Eclipse and my goal is to send it by email. I dont know what kind of computer the person is using, so I exported my project into a Runnable JAR File and checked the option Extract required libraries into generated JAR.p  pThe problem is that the generated JAR file is 20MB in size The project has only one simple window  nothing complicated or fancy.p  pI found that some people use ProGuard to include only what is really needed. p  pI would like to know if there is a way to optimize it manually Are there libraries that are automatically included when creating a WindowBuilder project, and how may I determine which libraries I can removep  pThank you.p

Negative 248 pWe have a PDF document processing system, implemented in AppleScript where we call the scripts from the shell using osascript. In some of the scripts, we call Acrobat Preflight Droplets from the Applescript. p  pThis does usually work without problems. However, in some cases, where the processed document is big orand complex. the droplet returns control to the script before the report is written and the document is moved to the success or failure folder. The consequence is that the process continues, but without the moved file, it eventually fails.p  pThe workaround so far has been to add a delay after those droplet calls. This does help, but it is a waste of time for small documents, and there will always be a document big and complex enough to take longer than the delay.p  pWe also found out that the time needed for finishing writing the report and moving the document depends on the speed of the system had to be expected.p  pThe workaround would be to calculate the delay from the document size, its number of pages, and a machinedependent parameter. Document size, and number of pages are no big deal they can be retrieved in the Applescript. p  pThe problem is the machinedependent parameter, which can be determined experimentally. But how do I make that parameter available to all the scripts needing itp  pIncorporating it into the scripts is not an option, because we have a number of systems installed, and if we would do that, wed end up in a maintenance nightmare. Passing it as an argument in the initial system call is also not possible, because the calls are many, and again would lead to a maintenance nightmare.p  pSo, is there a way to set up a place where that machine parameter can be stored and easily called from any Applescript, no matter how it itself is called.p  pThanks a lot for your advice.p

Negative 248 pI have an asp.net Web Api 2  Identity 2 application that requires a user to be authenticated. The authentication works but I notice that when I restart my local development machine and try to access a method that requires authentication then I get a failure. p  pAs my application is unchanged from the asp.net sample then I think it uses cookies to store user data on the client. Where and how does the Server or IIS store information on which users have authenticated Does it do this just the once or on every HTTP Is there a difference between my using Token or cookie authentication in the way that the authentication and also authorization is checked on the serverp

Negative 248 pIve been trying to create an application where everything is effectively an object with a series of fields. Ive abstracted it to the level that you have the following tablesp  ul liObjectTemplateli liFieldli liLinkObjectTemplateFieldli liFieldTypeli ul  pEach ObjectTemplate has a series of fields a manytomany relationship, which can be found in LinkObjectTemplateField. Field is linked to FieldType manytoone relationship. Field also has an ObjectTemplateID field  so lets suppose we have an object template called Section, and another object template called Question as in for a questionnaire. Section would have Question as a field for questionnaire designers to use to define which questions appear in a section. Each Question would then be linked to a series of Values or none at all in the case that it is of FieldType Text.p  pWere able to create fields, field types and object templates so far. However Ive come to realise that actually all 3 of these could be represented within the above tables, and I could probably kill off one of these tables too so I only have ObjectTemplate and LinkObjectTemplateField, where Field is an ObjectTemplate in its own right so there is a link simply between ObjectTemplate and itself via LinkObjectTemplateField.p  pMy aim is to have one table structure for ALL object types, both as it currently stands and in the future. Ill have a class which picks up all of the fields for a particular object, and the fields it is expecting based on the objecttemplate, and decides how to present the fields based on the template. This seems to be getting very complex and I keep finding myself getting confused. I have a week left to work on this, so my questions are should I plough on with this Are there any better techniques to achieve this, or any flaws in my approach Should I have stuck with the old structure an entire table for each object type, with the same fields as most other object types for the core details  name, description, deleted etc.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI have been going over my approach again and come to the following conclusionsp  ul liEach object type, including object template itself, should have its own record in the objecttemplate table.li liEach object template, field and fieldtype should then have its own row in the object table.li liIn this way, for example, Text, Dropdown etc. will be objects using the fieldtype object template. The IDs of these will be used in the functions for writing the forms  they will be declared as constants and referenced via MAINTEXT, MAINDROPDOWN and so on.li ul

Negative 248 pBackground info Im working on a public facing website for our company.  developing in VS2012, asp.net and vb.net, using some JS, some JQuery, and a decent amount of CSS.p  pEverything was looking great in our internal testing, until someone checked from home, where they only had IE 9.  Suddenly, big chunks of text within expanding panels werent being displayed, the bottom of the page was missing in most cases, some links that call javascript functions dont do anything... Its so random that the only reason I think theyre connected is that it only happens in IE9 or probably before, though no one has looked.  p  pI tried setting the standards mode to edge in the web.config.  tried setting it to IE10 as well, just to try Ive played with changing some positioning, heights in px instead of , relative to fixed positioning, tried inserting the html5shiv, removing the gradients... nothing has changed.  Everything displays correctly, until it doesnt display at all.  When I was starting to see and research this last week, I thought Id found an article somewhere that said there were limits on the CSS tags you could use in a page for IE9, but that number was WAY higher than anything Im using, including both whats on the page directly, and incorporating the .css file.  The only other clue is that it looks like at the bottom, where the missing stuff starts, I also lose the gradient from the page background so just a block of all white, however if I play with the size of the window, sometimes I can get this block to slide down, and I can see another line or two that was originally hidden...p  pHas anyone had issues like this  The site works perfect in chrome, ff, IE10 and 11, several Linux browsers, opera, safari, from macs, pcs, and Linux boxes.  everything except this old IE 9. p  pHELPp

Negative 248 pI am retrieving data from a remote web application and I store it in a local sqlite DB. From time to time I perform a codecommitcode call on the connection, which results in committing about 50 inserts to 8 tables. There are about 1000000 records in most tables. I dont use explicit codeBEGINcode and codeENDcode commands.p  pI measured codecommitcode call time and got 100150 ms. But during the commit, my PC freezes for 515 seconds. The codeINSERTcodes themselves are naive i.e. one execute call per insert but are performed fast enough their rate is limited by the speed of records retrieval, anyways, which is fairly low. Im using Arch Linux x64 on a PC with AMD FX 6200  CPU, 8 GB RAM and a SATA HDD, Python 3.4.1, sqlite 3.8.4.3.p  pDoes anyone have an idea why this could happen I guess it has something to do with HDD caching.

Negative 248 pMy particular problem first occured to me when using with a hrefhttpmkoryak.github.iofloatThead relnofollowhttpmkoryak.github.iofloatTheadap  pOn certain pages I have tables with a of of columns. The client opted for horizontally scrolling these tables. Therefore those tables are wrapped in a div that has codeoverflowx autocodep  pWorks nice on desktop browsers and SafariiOS.p  pWhen using floatThead at some point it requests the width of the table with codeouterWidthcode to set the width of the table header when it is floated. On the iPad that floated table header is just as wide as the wrapper element, the rest of it is cropped. I debugged the codeouterWidthcode values of both the container and the table.p  pOn a desktop browser I get values like e.g. 1200px for the container, but 1900px for the much wider table inside of the container.p  pBut in Safari iOS I get 935px for strongbothstrong the container and the table. The container elements doesnt have to be set to scroll larger contents to produce this error. I work with Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2. If there is a page with a container fluid, its width is adjusted to the window width. If there is a table inside with a larger width, it is visible through codeoverflow visiblecode. But  on the iPad  when floatThead is triggered, the floated table headers width gets restricted to the width of the fluid container minus its padding.p  pTherefore I presume that the reason for this is a different calculation of the width of bigger elements that are inside smaller containers.p  pIf I understand it correctly, jQuerys codeoutherWidthcode uses codecsscode to retreive the width of elements, and codecsscode uses codegetComputedStylecode or codecurrentStylecode.p  pI assume the browser returns the wrong with values, and thats all jQueryfloatThead can work with.p  pAnd I was wondering if my assumption is correct, or if there could be other factors triggering the wrong calculation of the width in Safari iOS.p

Negative 248 pI have a codeUITableViewcode with many codeUITableViewCellcodes in it. Each one has some simple custom graphics I made using codeUIViewcodes with rounded corners. Im experiencing bad performance when scrolling on older iPads 2nd and 3rd generation and after turning on strongDebug  Color Blended Layersstrong in the iOS Simulator I can see that the the part of the UIView that is removed by the rounded corner is left transparent, I think this is causing the bad scrolling performance.p  pBelow are some screen shots to help understand the problem.p  pWhat Id like to know is how I can make opaque the outer part of the codeUIViewcode that is cut out to make the round corners the orange coloured part in the second screenshot, so as to increase performance.

Negative 248 pI wrote a custom dropdown list for a web app Im working on and I have a specific set of functionality I want to accomplish with it. First of all, I want the dropdown to stay open if you move the mouse off of the menu. I want it to close when you either reclick the dropdown title, click one of the elements in the dropdown, or click anywhere else on the page. I also need to enable a scroll bar in the dropdown item list if there are too many elements. Were using a standard resolution so Im accomplishing this with the maxheight attribute. The way I accomplished keeping the menu open was to give the menu button focus and close the menu items when on the .bulr event.  The problem is .blur triggers when the user clicks the scroll bar and the menu closes.  I have an example of the menu I created here a hrefhttpcodepen.iojiggawaggapenwmkEG relnofollowhttpcodepen.iojiggawaggapenwmkEGa One strange thing Ive found is in Google Chrome in the app Im working on you can click on the scroll bar and the menu stays open, however in Internet Explorer it doesnt. The other weird thing is the example in Codepen.io has the exact same code as the app, but it wont stay open in Chrome. I dont really care about other browsers this is an internal app and we only target IE 8 bleh and Chrome due to corporate standards Below is the Javascript and HTML Im using to handle the menu. Again, full code and working example is at the codepen.io link abovep  precodeltdiv idcontainergt ltdiv idgroupdropdowngt   lta href idgroupdropdowntitlegt     GROUP NAME ltspan idgroupdropdownindicatorarrow classarrow arrowdowngtltspangt   ltagt   ltdiv idgroupdropdownitemcontainergt     ltdiv classgroupdropdownitem databind1234567gt         lta hrefgt           ltspan classgroupdropdwonitemnamegtGROUP 2 NAMEltspangt           ltbr gt           ltspan stylecolor daa520gtINPROGRESSltspangt           ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtGroup Numberltbgt 1651651ltspangt           ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtBCBS Numberltbgt 61565ltspangt         ltagt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classgroupdropdownitem databind1651651gt         ltspan classgroupdropdwonitemnamegtGROUP 3 NAMEltspangt         ltbr gt         ltspan stylecolor greengtACTIVEltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtGroup Numberltbgt 1651651ltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtBCBS Numberltbgt 61565ltspangt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classgroupdropdownitem databind1651651gt         ltspan classgroupdropdwonitemnamegtGROUP 3 NAMEltspangt         ltbr gt         ltspan stylecolor greengtACTIVEltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtGroup Numberltbgt 1651651ltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtBCBS Numberltbgt 61565ltspangt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classgroupdropdownitem databind1651651gt         ltspan classgroupdropdwonitemnamegtGROUP 3 NAMEltspangt         ltbr gt         ltspan stylecolor greengtACTIVEltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtGroup Numberltbgt 1651651ltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtBCBS Numberltbgt 61565ltspangt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classgroupdropdownitem databind1651651gt         ltspan classgroupdropdwonitemnamegtGROUP 3 NAMEltspangt         ltbr gt         ltspan stylecolor greengtACTIVEltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtGroup Numberltbgt 1651651ltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtBCBS Numberltbgt 61565ltspangt       ltdivgt     ltdiv classgroupdropdownitem databind1651651gt         ltspan classgroupdropdwonitemnamegtGROUP 3 NAMEltspangt         ltbr gt         ltspan stylecolor redgtTERMINATEDltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtGroup Numberltbgt 1651651ltspangt         ltspan stylecolor 0065a4gtltb stylecolor blackgtBCBS Numberltbgt 61565ltspangt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt  var menuOpen  false groupdropdowntitle.clickfunction               if menuOpen                  groupdropdowntitle.blur                 groupdropdowntitle.removeClasshovered                 groupdropdownitemcontainer.hide                 flipArrowdown                 menuOpen  false                          else                  groupdropdowntitle.focus                 groupdropdowntitle.addClasshovered                 groupdropdownitemcontainer.show                 flipArrowup                 menuOpen  true                                groupdropdowntitle.blurfunction e                  groupdropdowntitle.removeClasshovered                 groupdropdownitemcontainer.hide                 flipArrowdown                 menuOpen  false           function flipArrowdirection      if direction.toLowerCase  up          groupdropdownindicatorarrow.removeClassarrowdown         groupdropdownindicatorarrow.addClassarrowup      else if direction.toLowerCase  down          groupdropdownindicatorarrow.removeClassarrowup         groupdropdownindicatorarrow.addClassarrowdown       codepre

Negative 248 pHello Stack Overflow communityp  pIve been trying to come up with an algorithm that takes n boxes as input with unknown dimensions for width, height and depth and outputs the maximal number of these boxes that can be packed in a sequence. In order to pack a box into another a box needs to have a smaller width, lenght and depth. You can also tilt the boxes in any way you want in order to make them fit. However they must be axis aligned.p  pI thought i had come up with a solution where I sorted all boxes on volume and then tried to pack every box in a sequence in a fashion similiar to selection sort, but selection pack i guess. In which i tried to pack the box with the lowest dimension into the next one that is larger, etc. Then i tried the second box and tried to pack all those who were larger. Anyway Im stuck and would really appreciate some helpp  pGreat thanksp

Negative 248 pI have a simple dropdown submenu that I show when you hover a list element of a horizontal menu.p  pI position the dropdown submenu by setting relative position to LI parent and absolute position to the container of the submenu.p  pThen I show the submenu by listening to mouseenter with jquery and I hide it by listening to mouseleave.p  pAt first looks like everything is working fine, but after adding some content to the submenu so that it now has like 100px height Im starting to have a problemp  pThe mouseenter runs fine but the mouseleave gets fired a lot before reaching the end of the submenu, it gets fired when Im half a way to reach the end.p  pWhy is this happeningp

Negative 248 pIm working on a NopCommercebased project which uses ASP MVC, Autofac and Entity Framework.

Sometimes the exception is triggered from inside the Route, and sometimes it comes from inside the controller. Meaning that the routes GetRouteData has completed, passed over flow to the controller and then failed inside there. But, most of the time, the exception occurs within the Route. When the exception does happen from inside the controller, its at different lines where the exception occurs. p  pSometimes one method will fail, and another time that method will run fine, and then next method in the call stack fails. Its different each time, but these method calls use a common method for retrieving from the DB. p  pThere are 2 other routes which are registered before this one that are mapped to emurlem that perform database lookups of the incoming URL, and the exception never happens there. So, its not like this route is the first operation to perform any DB work. p  pThe service is dependency registered p  precodebuilder.RegisterControllerstypeFinder.GetAssemblies.ToArray  builder.RegisterltIDbContextgtc gt new NopObjectContextDataSettings.DataConnectionString.InstancePerLifetimeScope  builder.RegisterGenerictypeofEfRepositoryltgt.AstypeofIRepositoryltgt.InstancePerLifetimeScope  builder.RegisterTypeltMemoryCacheManagergt.AsltICacheManagergt.NamedltICacheManagergtnopcachestatic.SingleInstance  builder.RegisterTypeltMyServicegt.AsltIMySerivcegt                    .WithParameterResolvedParameter.ForNamedltICacheManagergtnopcachestatic                    .InstancePerLifetimeScope  codepre  pThe Controller receives the service via Constructor Injectionp  precodeprotected readonly IMyService myService  public MyControllerIMyService myService      myService  myService  codepre  pAnd the route resolves the service as followedp  precodepublic override RouteData GetRouteDataHttpContextBase httpContext      var myService  EngineContext.Current.ResolveltIMyServicegt     myService.databaseOperation lt falls over here w concurrency   codepre  pAny ideas why these errors are occurring and how to resolve them p  pFrom my understanding, it seems that our DBContext is being shared across 2 requests, however in my dependency registration Ive told it to resolve as a lifetime score  which should be unique to every request. Ive read a lot into causes of this exception and how its down to the dependency injection framework to control the lifetime of a dependency and to manage disposing of its resources  its here that things are falling down, it seems.p  pIn regards to the service itself, it works like all other services in the application  theres nothing standout and different about it.p  pIve pasted the full exception stacktraces a hrefhttppastebin.comXYEwRQsv relnofollowhttppastebin.comXYEwRQsva as well as the offending line of code. p  pEDIT I am using MultipleActiveResultSetsTrue in the connection string. The entity that this service deals with is standalone, i.e. it has no relations with other entities, so there should be no multiple iterations of child entities once the querys been executed, as other answers in regards to these exceptions point out.p  pEDIT This is the line that throws the exception.p  precodepublic string GetFriendlyUrlStringstring originalUrl      var friendly   cacheManager.GetoriginalUrl.ToLower,  gt             from f in friendlyUrlRepository.ReadOnlyTable      lt Here              where f.OriginalUrl  originalUrl              select f.Url.ToList.SingleOrDefault      return friendly  originalUrl  codepre  pAnd exception is p  precodeExecuteReader requires an open and available Connection.

My exceptions are 95 of the time from one of these 4 calls  usually the first fails, but sometimes the first DB call will be ok and the others fall through. Very infrequently I see the exception come from inside the controller that this route uh...routes to. Again, with that controller exception then the actual DB connection problem happens on one of 5 lines of code  again showing that its made x many DB calls then fallen over.p

Negative 248 pThe idea is pretty simple and it almost works. There are two tables and the user has the option of dragging rows between the two tables. When a row is dragged from table1 to table2, ajax is used in order to update the database with the data that is removed from table1, added to table2, and to redisplay both of the tables with the new data. The same thing works if information is dragged from table2 to table1.p  pYou can see a sample of the code a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbhealyt011juda22 relnofollowherea.p  pHere is an excerpt of the Javascript code for one of the tablesp  precodevar startTable  table1 var tabs  startTable  tbody.connectedSortable .sortable     connectWith .connectedSortable,     items gt trnotfirst,     appendTo tabs,     helperclone,     cursormove,     zIndex 999990  .disableSelection  tabs.droppable     accept .connectedSortable tr,     hoverClass uistatehover,     dropfunctionevent, ui         var start ui.draggable.attrid         var desTable  this.attrid         ifstart  desTable             alertThe ajax should be called                  return false       codepre  pIt works perfectly except for just one case. If a row is being dragged from Table1 to Table2, it creates a slot to show where the row will be inserted when the row is let go. In other words, if a user drags a row from Table1 to the last element of Table2, it creates an open placeholder under the last row in Table2 to depict where the row will go when let go. There is one problem with this. If the placeholder is created but the row is then dragged outside of the table and let go, the row still goes to the placeholder but the draggable property is never called.p  pWhat I would like to happen is if a placeholder is created, no matter where the row is let go, it will go to the placeholder and call the droppable code that corresponds to the table it was dropped in. If no placeholder is present, the row should go back to where it was dragged from and nothing should happen.p  pEvery example Ive tried that drags rows between two tables has the same problem. Do you guys have any way to call the droppable code even if the row is being dropped outside of the table Or maybe there is a better way to call ajax rather than when the row is dropped on the table Any insight would be greatly appreciated.p

You also know that someone else reordered the list into codeScode, and you have to find out the new order.

Negative 248 pI have a templated struct in a Swift library I am writing.  This struct has two characteristicsp  ul liEvery struct wraps or represents another arbitrary type.  A codeFooltTgtcode wraps a codeTcodeli liThese structs can be combined to form a third struct, whose represented type should be a combination read tuple of the first two.  In another worlds, if codefooA FooltAgtcode and codefooB FooltBgtcode, then codefooA  fooBcode should be of type codeFooltA, Bgtcode.li ul  pThis works well enough when there are only two types to combine, but when you chain this combination operation you start getting nested tuples, which is not what I want.  For example, in the following codep  precodelet a  FooltAgt initialize  let b  FooltBgt initialize  let c  FooltCgt initialize   let d  a  b  type is FooltA, Bgt let e  d  c  type is FooltA, B, Cgt codepre  pcodedcode has type codeFooltA, Bgtcode, which is what we want, but codeecode has type codeFooltA, B, Cgtcode, which is an extra level of unwanted nesting.p  pstrongI need some way to express that the combination of a codeFooltAgtcode and a codeFooltBgtcode is not a codeFooltA, Bgtcode, but rather a codeFooltA  Bgtcode,strong where codecode is a hypothetical static operation which means if the first type is a tuple type, append the second type onto it, yielding a new, nonnested tuple type.  If it is not a tuple type, simply make the tuple type codeA, Bcode.p  pThis feels like pushing to compiler to beyond its limits, and I suspect that it might not be possible with Swifts current templating capabilities and type system.  Still, if anyone can offer a workaround, a redesign that doesnt encounter this problem in the first place, or something conceptually similar but not identical to what Im trying to do, it would be extremely helpful.   As things stand, Im at an impasse.p

Negative 248 pIm just getting started with Sails JS and Im inexperienced with RESTful APIs. To get things started I generated a codeUsercode model as the guide suggests. I figured this would match to my codeuserscode table. I added attributes to my model based on my tables columns. When I lifted my server and made a GET request on my users, it returned all of my users I figured I was okay to generate the rest of my models at this point, so I created several more. Thats when I ran into problems. I started getting this error codeERPARSEERROR You have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near SELEC FROM timeline AS timeline at line 1code. This threw me off. Based on the syntax error, I thought maybe it was something I could have done, though I hadnt written any queries anywhere. I then noticed that when I changed my model name from Timeline to Timelines, I didnt have a problem.p  pIt seems to me, Sails has a problem with me naming my models the same name as my tables. Why is this Wouldnt doing so be more logical Furthermore, is Sails attempting to automatically match my models to my tablesp

As you see, performFiltering is ran in background thread, so it does not block the ui thread. However the results dont show up immediately so it does not look snappy. Is this normal Is there anything I can do to improve this If not how can I make the experience better Edit Added the CustomComparator class.p  precodeclass CustomComparator implements ComparatorltStringgt      private String searchString      public CustomSearchStringComparatorString searchString          searchString  searchString           public void setSearchStringString searchString          searchString  searchString           Override     public int compareString lhs, String rhs  int res  customComparelhs, rhs           finally alphabetic         if res  0              res  alphaComparelhs, rhs                   return res           private int customCompareString lhs, String rhs              String lhsTitle  lhs.toLowerCaseLocale.getDefault             String rhsTitle  rhs.toLowerCaseLocale.getDefault              String[] lhsNames  lhsTitle.splits             String lhsFirstName  lhsNames[0]             String lhsLastName  lhsNames.length gt 1  lhsNames[1]                 if there is a middle name...             if lhsNames.length gt 2                  lhsLastName  lhsNames[2]                           String[] rhsNames  rhsTitle.splits             String rhsFirstName  rhsNames[0]             String rhsLastName  rhsNames.length gt 1  rhsNames[1]                 if there is a middle name...             if rhsNames.length gt 2                  rhsLastName  rhsNames[2]                           boolean lhsFirstNameContains  lhsFirstName.startsWithsearchString             boolean rhsFirstNameContains  rhsFirstName.startsWithsearchString             boolean lhsLastNameContains  lhsLastName.startsWithsearchString             boolean rhsLastNameContains  rhsLastName.startsWithsearchString              if lhsFirstNameContains  rhsFirstNameContains                  if lhsLastNameContains  rhsLastNameContains                      return 0                  else                      return rhsLastNameContains  1  1                               else                  return rhsFirstNameContains  1  1                       private int alphaCompareString lhs, String rhs          return String.CASEINSENSITIVEORDER.comparelhs, rhs      codepre

Negative 248 pSo there is a partial answer to this question for Obj. C. and I am just asking the mechanics of the same idea within Swift. Furthermore I want to compare and contrast switching ViewControllers and switching scenes as a way of switching between a game and its MainMenu. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24784814presentingasceneinspritekitwithoutdiscardingthepreviousPresenting a scene in SpriteKit without discarding the previousap  pIn the above section, the author said that scenes are completely discarded when I present a new scene in that codeViewControllercode, is this true in spritekitswift What I am doing is I have a couple of scenes GameScene, MainMenuScene, OptionsScene, etc. That I am constantly switching between as a way of switching views entirely. Will this delete all data associated with that instance of GameScene I dont want any remnants of that data slowing down my game over time. Furthermore, some people recommend switching ViewControllers instead of scenes for the idea of MainMenu, etc. What are the positives and negatives to each methodp

Negative 248 pI am actually facing a big problem with several websites actually 3 based on Prestashop. The problem is that PHP or Prestashop randomly rounds prices to the nearest integer and it is strongnot systematicstrong. p  pMost of the time, it works perfectly, as it should, but sometimes it can takes weeks or months between two problems, a price is rounded. My round mode option is correctly set to display two decimals.p  pThe problem can occur when editing a product price in the backoffice or when the customer is at the checkout step. p  pI tried to reproduce the problem, so I created a basic test I retrieve a cart information and I display its price. I refreshed the page many times and I saw the price rounded a few times only. The most intriguous thing is that neither the context nor the code have changed between the beginning and the ending of the test.p  pI searched for help on Google and no one seemed to have this problem...p  pDid someone encounter this problem Do you think it is a PHP issue or a Prestashop one Thanks in advance for your help.p  pHere is the code of the round function Prestashop is usingp  precoderoundvalue, 2, PHPROUNDHALFUP codepre  pFor information, the version of PHP 5.4.39.p
Negative 248 pIf you want to introduce a layer of indirection on the component level  i.e. declaratively  how would you do that Im not aware of any possibility to do this in a declarative manner with Ember. You could do codegetElementByIdcode but with this you can only grab the DOM output and not the component instance.p  pTo make my question more tangible, an example Say you have component A that has a configurable behaviour that you dont want to define overandover again through an attribute. So the component may do a lookup on a key like codemeta.A.configSettingcode to see whether there the codeconfigSettingcode has been set globally.p  pPolymer has a component called a hrefhttpsgithub.comPolymerLabspolymermeta relnofollowpolymermetaa for this. And a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma257992771821792herea an illustration how it can be used. You also place component AX in your app which happens to provider a specific value for this config key and probably for many others in a a hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiMonostatePattern relnofollowmonostatea manner.p  pSpeaking more generally, with Polymer you can plumb things together by passing IDs of DOM elements around that you can lookup and use as normal JS objects. I think this is nice and I dont see any equivalent in Ember.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 248 pI am using sklearn.svm.SVC kernelrbf for the classification of an image data, which is doing pretty well job. Linear SVM classifies the data by putting a hyper plane between the two classes. In the case of rbf SVM the plane would be in infinite dimension. For any testing point we can use predict to check which it belongs to. In linear case we can manually get the prediction by getting the equation of the hyper plane. How can we do this in rbf SVM case. How exactly predict works in rbf SVM case.p

Negative 248 pFor one of our projects we are using PostgreSQL and access two tables with complex SQL calculations due to performance advantages.p  pEach table, lets call them codeTableAcode and codeTableBcode, have 1301 fields of type double precision field number restriction by PostgreSQL The field names for codeTableAcode are codeidcode, codeA1code, codeA2code, ..., codeA1300code and for codeTableBcode codeidcode, codeB2code, ..., codeB1300code.p  pWe are using many dynamically changing formulas which can directly access the two tables with a simple codeidcode join to do calculations over the numeric data in the records.p  pAn example formula would be codeA99  A1  B3  B5  B88code p  pSo the program can simply take the formula and directly use it in its SQL like p  precodeselect A99  A1  B3  B5  B88 as ResultValue from TableA A join TableB B on A.id  B.id codepre  pThis worked fast in one DB request to 2 indexed tables. But over time, the system has grown, and all the available fields are used up. p  pNow, the requirement is to have nearly no restriction in the amount of used fields, to accommodate much longer and more complex calculations in one SQL codeselectcode over 2 tables. I must admit I dont know much about many other new database systems and their capabilities for such a problem. Are there databases which would support such a concept or another way to have those calculations done in the database The old way was very flexible for the time being, but is there a more efficient way to implement the same logic Reading out the data dynamically in to the program, parsing it and calculating with it will probably take much longer. I also think just using another database which allows defining tables with more then 1300 fields would be a short term solution, until we need more fields.p

The depth of the tree in this is  ChildScope.parent.parent which is inherited from Scope. I see ChildScope.parent.parent.listeners as locationChangeStart, locationChangeSuccess and routeChangeSuccess arrays with their emprotoems. Can I think this parent.parent is created by the Sails MVC Framework using the routeProvider API of angularp  pQ. 2. I would assume the top most in the tree, ChildScope, is created by the ngcontroller upon the rootScope.new. But, Im still intrigued why the tree is ChildScope.parent.parent, instead of ChildScope.parent Am I missing something The ChildScope.parent doesnt have watchers or listeners. The ChildScope, of course, doesnt have any listeners as I havent created any events.p  pQ. 3. I also observe that ChildScope.parent doesnt have root, but ChildScope.parent.parent.root is existing and it seems to be a reference to ChildScope.parent.parent. Also, the ChildScope.parent.parent.root.root...is spiral and doesnt end. The last parents reference is root, which has a root and so on. Why doesnt this root chain exist and where does it take its reference fromp

Negative 248 pImagine, that we have X 30 for example number of system. Each system has an  array of Entities on which it has to operate the number of Entities for a system is different for each . So basically, systems contain algorithms and Entities contain data to be acted upon. Each system can specify what kind of Entities it can act upon, thus an Entity can be operated upon by multiple systems.p  pThe systems are arranged in a chain, meaning that we run then sequentially, not in paralell. They are called upon in the same sequence each time to act upon their Entities all we have to do is call their Systemprocess method.p  pThis system chain is run 60 times each second.p  hr  pCurrently, it is implemented so that a system runs on a single thred, processing its Entities sequentially. Id like to have concurrency.p  pSystems do not have state, therefore we can safely call their process methods on multiple threads at once, given that we tell each method call on which portion of the systems Entities should it work on.p  pExample we determin that we have 2 cores available, therefore we run each system on 2 threads. One of the threads calls a systems process method and tells it to process from 0 to 20 indexes of the array containing the Entities, the other thread calls the same systems process method and tells it to process from 20 to 40.p  hr  pNow the questions what is the optimal number of threads the load should be distributed on, taking the probable cache size and cores and what not into account. Maybe decided empirically by testingp  pWhat would be the most efficent way to manage the Threads thread pool etc.p

Negative 248 pIve created some custom code that will capture how long a user spent viewing a picture.  The timer will stop when the user clicks or escapes from the fancybox view.  Is there an alternate way for me to implement this functionality without using the codecounterStop setIntervalcode variablep  pThe specific reason why I added another codesetIntervalcode was so that I could quickly stop the first the codecounterIncreasecode variable.  If the user clicked too fast and reopened the fancyBox, the timer would stack on itself and increment faster than the intended 1 second.p  pAlso, as this was a refinement of a previous implementation of this exact functionality lines of code was significantly reducedrefined, please point out, edit and critque any methods that you would have done differently, so long as the result is the same.p

It builds and works, but I dont see why anyone would do this and also to which extent this is allowed. For instance, protected narrows the access, so it is allowed but you cant override a base class protected method with public I dont know.p

Negative 248 pIm not sure I fully understand how the mipmaps could be used, so I have this question. The system seems to choose the best suitable image from all provided mipmap densities when a mipmap is used in a custom size not the original for the phones density. Then isnt mipmaps a good way to provide images for relative layouts where the size of the images will be inconsistent on all devices And if so, is it backwards compatible to API 14 Is it going to work when only one .apk for all kinds of screens is compiledp

Negative 248 p[Homework] I am going to solve the linear system Axb by the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method, and I use spilu function from scipy.sparse.linalg for the preconditioner.
