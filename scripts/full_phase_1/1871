Positive 1871 pIs there any way to automatically initialize a constant array of procedure pointersp  pI have a bunch of routines, which have to be called depending on the value of an integer variable. Instead of using a codeselect casecode statement, I would like to use procedure pointers as given below. However, it would be nice, if I could skip the explicit initialization of the procedure pointer array, and just define it as a constant array of wrapped procedure pointers. The code below demonstrates the solution Ive found, the commented lines indicate the goal, Id like to achievep  precodemodule testmod   implicit none    abstract interface     subroutine subInterface     end subroutine subInterface   end interface    type  SubPtr     proceduresubInterface, nopass, pointer  ptr   end type SubPtr     Would be nice to use something like this   typeSubPtr, parameter  subs2  [ SubPtrsub1, SubPtrsub2 ]  contains    subroutine sub1     print , SUB1   end subroutine sub1    subroutine sub2     print , SUB2   end subroutine sub2  end module testmod   program test   use testmod   implicit none    typeSubPtr  subs2   integer  ii     Would be nice to get rid of those two initialization lines   subs1  SubPtrsub1     subs2  SubPtrsub2     Testing procedure pointer array   do ii  1, 2     call subsiiptr   end do  end program test codepre
Positive 1871 pI have two derived types child1 and child2 that both extend from the same abstract type codetype, abstract  partentcode. The abstract type has a deferred bound procedure.p  pI want to call a subroutine that performs some stuff performance critical depending on the type of the child handed over as input. I can think of two optionsp  ul liThe subroutine takes the codeclassparent, intentinout  typeincode as input. Implementations for the children are then done within a codeselect type typeincode construct.li liI write two subroutines, one with codetypechild1, intentinout  typeincode and one with codetypechild2, intentinout  typeincode and provide an explicit interface to overload the routine name.li ul  pThe first option allows for implementations where the extension of the parent is not known at compile time, but that is not necessary in my case. It also saves some lines of code because only a part of it is different for the children.p  pMy question is Is there additional overhead in option one because I implemented the input as polymorphic data when the type is known at compile timep
Positive 1871 pThe namelist readwrite feature in Fortran is extremely convenient, but in attempting to make my own custom namelistesque readwrite feature.

Something likep  precodecharacter30  color writecolor, A blue codepre  pand yet that is the only way I can think of the namelist feature working. So how does itp

TDMGCC gfortran is perhaps the closest I got, as I could run a DLL created from gfortran, but not in C. In fact, in TDMGCC gfortran, after I created a Fortran DLL that was referencing a C DLL, all function calls to the Fortran generated DLL within Excel VBA would immediately return 0, even after no warnings were given after compiling the Fortran DLL In other cases, it said it could not find the function name in the DLL, even though I made them without decorations or underscores. Excluding the C DLL from that build would eliminate that problem, but of course, I need to reference the C DLL as it has required 3rd party functions.p  pI looked at other posts and could not find an answer to this questionp  ul lipMy question is not a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22134259fortrandllimportimporting a Fortran DLL into c or Capli lipI do not get the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10381739runfortrandllwithvisualstudioAdd as Link option when right clicking AddExisting Itemapli lipThe answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1237129howtocallcsharpcodefromfortrandllthis posta did not solve my questionpli lipA similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23433508fortrancallingacdllwhichinturncallsanotherfortrandllherea was not answered adequatelypli ul  pPlease provide a stepbystep guide to getting Fortran to work with DLLIMPORT, with both gfortran and Intel Visual Studio Fortran, if possible.

Positive 1871 pI am just starting to learn fortran and I have made a simple program, implementing Eulers method. I noticed that the time used by the codedocode loop is fairly similar to, for example, the same program in Matlab.p  pIn my Fortran program, I had a write to a file inside this codedocode loop. When I removed it the speed drastically improved, as expected.

Positive 1871 pI am trying to integrate a Matlab program I wrote into some Fortran code. I tried to follow the example Mathworks a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabmatlabexternalcallmatlabfunctionsfromfortranapplications.html relnofollowprovidesa. But I cant get it to compile because I cant find the header files it requests.p  pDoes anyone know of an example of someone getting it to work on Linux using an Intel compiler.

Positive 1871 pIve inherited both the source code and a compiled executable for a Fortran77 program.  I do not know what compiler was used to make the existing executable, however Im using GCC 4.9.2.  Among other things, the program reads and writes records fromto a binary file.  The number of records is also stored in the beginning of the file.p  pMy problem is that the executable I compile myself incorrectly reads the number of records from the file, and consequently throws an error when it tries to read past the last record.  The binary data file was generated using the existing executable the one I inherited, and surprisingly, when I use the existing executable to read from the data file, it works as expected.p  pMy question is, could the Fortran READWRITE statements have different semantics such as file layout depending on the platform, fortran version, or compiler typeversionp  pFor what its worth, the read and write code is p  precode    WRITEINLIB,REC1NPROD,ELMNTSK,K1,ITE,ATOMWTKK,KK1,    ITE,IOUT,INFILE,ITERM,IBM,LINEPR      READINLIB,REC1NPROD,ELMNTSK,K1,ITE,ATOMWTKK,KK1,ITE    ,IOUT,INFILE,ITERM,IBM,LINEPR codepre  pcodeNPRODcode is the number of records in the file.  When I put a break point after the codeREADcode statement, I can see that codeNPRODcode is about 300,000, when I know for a fact that there are only about 2,000 records.p  pThis is the code for opening the filep  precode    OPENUNITINLIB,FILEPRODUCT.BIN,ACCESSDIRECT,RECL1188,    STATUSOLD codepre  pWith regard to endianess, I think my current platform is compatible with the binary data file because if I open it in a hex editor, I can see some legible ASCII text that makes sense in the context of the program.p
Positive 1871 pI am attempting to replicate some Python code in Fortran 90 to make it work within a larger Fortran project I am contributing to.

For any given outlet root there may be hundreds or thousands upstream paths. There would be no modification of the network required once it is initialized, although there will be calls to many different nodes within the network in the above example, a call will be made for all upstream paths from 1, from 6, from 5, etc.  Ive been looking into using pointers but cant seem to find any examples out there of this kind of pathfinding.p
Positive 1871 pI am working on some simulation work for my research and have run into a snag importing fortran into my python scripts. As background, I have worked with Python for some years now, and have only toyed around inside of Fortran when the need arose.p  pI have done some work in the past with Fortran implementing some simple OpenMP functionality. I am no expert in this, but I have gotten the basics going before.p  pI am now using f2py to create a library I can call on from my python script. When I try to compile openmp, it compiles correctly and runs to completion, but there is zero improvement in speed and looking at top I see that the CPU usage indicates that only one thread is running.p  pIve scoured the documentation for f2py which is not very well documented as well as done the normal web sleuthing for answers. Ive included the Fortran code I am compiling as well as a simple python script that calls on it. I also am throwing in the compile command I am using.p  pCurrently I cut down the simulation to 104 as a nice benchmark. On my system it takes 3 seconds to run. Ultimately I need to run a number of 106 particle simulations though, so I need to bring down the time a bit.p  pIf anyone can point me in the direction of how to get my code working, it would be super appreciated. I can also try to include any detailed information about the system as needed. p  pCheers, Rylkanp  hr  p1 Compilep  precodef2py c f90flagsfopenmp lgomp m calcacceljerk calcacceljerk.f90 codepre  hr  p2 Python script to callp  precodeimport numpy as N import calcacceljerk   a is a 1e5,7 array with M,r,v information a         N.load..test.npy a         a[1e4]  out  calcacceljerk.calca,a.shape[0] print out[10] codepre  hr  p3 Fortran codep  precodesubroutine calc inputarray, nrow, outputarray implicit none f2py threadsafe include omplib.h  integer, intentin  nrow double precision, dimensionnrow,7, intentin  inputarray double precision, dimensionnrow,2, intentout  outputarray   Calculation parameters with set values double precision,parameter  psrM1.551.3267297e20 double precision,parameter  GMsun1.3267297e20 double precision,parameter  pctom3.08e16   Vector declarations integer  irow double precision  vfac double precision, dimensionnrow  drx,dry,drz,dvx,dvy,dvz,rmag,jfac,az,jz   Break up the input array for faster access double precision,dimensionnrow  inputM double precision,dimensionnrow  inputrx double precision,dimensionnrow  inputry double precision,dimensionnrow  inputrz double precision,dimensionnrow  inputvx double precision,dimensionnrow  inputvy double precision,dimensionnrow  inputvz  inputM   inputarray,1GMsun inputrx  inputarray,2pctom inputry  inputarray,3pctom inputrz  inputarray,4pctom inputvx  inputarray,51000 inputvy  inputarray,61000 inputvz  inputarray,71000  OMP PARALLEL DO privatevfac,drx,dry,drz,dvx,dvy,dvz,rmag,jfac,az,jz sharedoutputarray NUMTHREADS2 DO irow  1,nrow      Get the ith iteration     vfac   sqrtinputMirowpsrM     drx    inputrxinputrxirow     dry    inputryinputryirow     drz    inputrzinputrzirow     dvx    inputvxinputvxirowvfac     dvy    inputvyinputvyirowvfac     dvz    inputvzinputvzirowvfac     rmag   sqrtdrx2dry2drz2     jfac   3drzdrx2dry2drz2       Calculate the acceleration and jerk     az  inputMdrzrmag3     jz  inputMrmag3dvxdrxjfacdvydryjfacdvzdvzdrzjfac       Remove bad index     azirow  0     jzirow  0      outputarrayirow,1  sumaz     outputarrayirow,2  sumjz END DO OMP END PARALLEL DO  END subroutine calc codepre

Positive 1871 pI got one application developed in Pascal and this application using some fortran files as library. In this Pascal application, coding are there to create shared memory and writing the values which is calculated in Fortran lib files. Actually the Lib files were in Visual fortran. So to work in windows 7 i converted this to Inter fortran and compiled it. When i open application in windows7, and i m giving my input from the pascal application and it writes in shared memory  im sure because i can see the calculated values which are get stored in shared memory. But when i use this same application in Windows 8.1 Pro , the input values are not get write in shared memory. It always get the entered value as zero.p  pSo, is there any difference in using shared memory in windows 7 and windows 8.1p
Positive 1871 pI have written a scientific code and, as usual, this boils to calculating the coefficients in an algebraic Eigenvalue equation Calculating these coefficients requires integrating over multidimensional arrays and this quickly inflates memory usage drastically. Once the matrix coefficients are calculated, the original, preintegation multidimensional arrays can be deallocated and intelligent solvers take over, so memory usage ceases to be the big issue. As you can see there is a bottleneck and on my 64 bit, 4 core, 8 threads, 8GB ram laptop the program crashes due to insufficient memory.p  pI am therefore implementing a system that keeps memory usage in check by limiting the size of the tasks that the MPI processes can take on when calculating some of the Eigenvalue matrix elements. When finished they will then look for remaining jobs to be done so the matrix still gets filled but in a more sequential and less parallel way.p  pI was therefore checking how much memory I can allocate and here is where the confusion starts I allocate doubles with size 8 bytes checked using codesizeof1code and look at the allocation status.p  pThough I have 8 GB of ram available running a test with only 1 process, I can allocate an array of up to size code40000,40000code, which corresponds to about 13GB of memory My first question is thus How is this possible Is there so much virtual memoryp  pSecondly, I realized that I can also do the same thing for multiple processes Up to strong16strong processes can, strongsimultaneouslystrong allocate these massive arraysp  pThis cannot be right p  pDoes somebody understand why this happens And whether I am doing something wrongp  pstrongEditstrongp  pHere is a code that produces the aforementioned miracle, at least on my machine. However, when I set the elements of the arrays to some value it indeed behaves as it should and crashesor at least starts behaving strongverystrong slowly, which I guess is due to the fact that slow virtual memory is usedp  precodeprogram testmiracle     use ISOFORTRANENV     use MPI      implicit none       global variables     integer, parameter  dp  REAL64                                            double precision     integer, parameter  maxstrln  120                                       maximum length of filenames     integer  ierr                                                              error variable     integer  nprocs                                                           MPI nr. of procs       start MPI     call MPIinitierr                                                          initialize MPI     call MPICommsizeMPICommworld,nprocs,ierr                              nr.

Negative 1871 pThis is driving me nuts.  I am using some 3rdparty code in a Windows .lib that, in debug mode, is causing an error similar to the followingp  precodeRunTime Check Failure 2  Stack around the variable foo was corrupted. codepre  pThe error is thrown when either the object goes out of scope or is deleted.  Simply allocating one of these objects and then deleting it will throw the error.  I therefore think the problem is either in one of the many constructorsdestructors but despite stepping through every line of code I cannot find the problem.p  pHowever, this only happens when creating one of these objects in a static library.  If I create one in my EXE application, the error does not appear.  The 3rdparty code itself lives in a static lib.  For example, this failsp  precode3RDPARTY.LIB  class Foo  public Base      ...   MY.LIB  void Test      Foo foo  new Foo     delete foo  CRASH   MY.EXE  void Func      Test  codepre  pBut this will workp  precode3RDPARTY.LIB  class Foo  public Base      ...   MY.EXE  void Func      Foo foo  new Foo     delete foo  NO ERROR  codepre  pSo, cutting out the middle .lib file makes the problem go away and it is this weridness that is driving me mad.  The EXE and 2 libs all use the same CRT library.  There are no errors linking.  The 3rdparty code uses inheritance and there are 5 base classes.  Ive commented out as much code as I can whilst still getting it to build and I just cant see whats up.p  pSo if anyone knows why code in a .lib would act differently to the same code in a .exe, I would love to hear it.  Ditto any tips for tracking down memory overwrites  I am using Visual Studio 2008.p

The server end will include some sort of intermediary layer which communicates between the client and the back end. The back end is going to be a c based Windows service which performs validation and calculations based on user actions attack, defend, move, skills, leveling etc etc. p  pWhat are the pros and cons of the following for middle communication layer between the Silverlight 3.0 Client and the c windows service on the server.p  ol liSocketsli liWCF  WCF Duplex Serviceli li.Net RIA Servicesli ol  pCurrently I dont know anything about the three options above, however I have in the past created ASP.Net Web services and in university I did some socket programing that I have mostly forgotten. p
Negative 1871 pI cant use unit tests for some parts of code so Im falling back to regression tests. I would like to check whether my program behaves in the same way after some modifications. And by behaviour I mean mostly a state of data structures.  So far I was serializing them into human readable text format and dumped to some files in the first run. Then in the next dumps I could compare whether the state changed or not. And update it if the change comes from a new feature and not from a bug.p  pI could use a library C to organize all that. Do you know any Together with dump files it would provide a cheap, massive unittest.p  pThe most cumbersome thing are the serialization procedures. Sometimes I just dump memory state, but when it is different its hard to reverse engineer. So I moved to another method. Now, during the compare phase I read a memory dump into a phantom object and run a specialized diff method operator with rich error reporting, which sometimes is easier to write than serializing to human readable text format. p  pBasically I feel like reinventing the wheel, so my questions are quite generalbr How do you perform regression testing if you do br Do you use any librarytoolkit br Have you ever implemented one for your own needs brp  pAnd just out of curiosity br Have you ever wanted to do regression testing, but something stopped youp

Negative 1871 pUsing LWUIT framework to develop mobile application. In LWUIT by default first command is placed in the left and subsequent commands will be placed in the right menu of the form including the command which is already placed in form left.I need to add two menus to form.Left menu contains general application specific commands such as Minimize,Back and Exit. Right Menu contains screen specific commands such as Play Audio,Play Video etc... Initially left softbutton of the form contains the text Options and the right softbutton of the form contains the text Menu. When user selects Options, a menu will be displayed with the following commands Minimize Back Exit When user selects right soft button Menu, a menu will be displayed with screen specific commands Play Audio Play Video etc... Commands of the right menu keeps changing from one form to another form, whereas the commands of left menu remains the same for all screensforms. I know command menu can be customized by overriding Form.createCommandListVector which returns a list. But here in my case I need two listsmenus.

Negative 1871 pWhen using an Androidgenerated ant build file, the file references your SDK installation via an sdk.dir property inside the local.properties files which is generated by android update project p ..p  pThe comments in build.xml suggest that local.properties should NOT be checked into version control.p  pBUT, when you run your build from Hudson, it does a fresh checkout of your code from version control, hence local.properties does not exist and subsequently the build fails without sdk.dir being set. So its kind of chicken and egg problem. As a workaround I have checked local.properties into version control for now nobody else will use it but I was curious as to how other developers had tackled this problem p

Negative 1871 pImagine I have a stackbased toy language that comes with the operations Push, Pop, Jump and If.p  pI have a program and its input is the toy language. For instance I get the sequencep  precodePush 1 Push 1 Pop Pop codepre  pIn that case the maximum stack would be 2. A more complicated example would use branches.p  precodePush 1 Push true If   .success Pop Jump .continue .success Push 1 Push 1 Pop Pop Pop .continue codepre  pIn this case the maximum stack would be 3. However it is not possible to get the maximum stack by walking top to bottom as shown in this case since it would result in a stackunderflow error actually.p  pCFGs to the rescue you can build a graph and walk every possible path of the basic blocks you have. However since the number of paths can grow quickly for n vertices you get n1 possible paths.p  pMy current approach is to simplify the graph as much as possible and to have less possible paths. This works but I would consider it ugly. Is there a better read faster way to attack this problem I am fine if the algorithm produces a stack depth that is not optimal. If the correct stack size is m then my only constraint is that the result n is n  m. Is there maybe a greedy algorithm available that would produce a good result herep  pbUpdateb I am aware of cycles and the invariant that all controlf flow merges have the same stack depth. I thought I write down a simple toylike language to illustrate the issue. Basically I have a deterministic stackbased language JVM bytecode, so each operation has a known stackdelta.p  pPlease note that I do have a working solution to this problem that produces good results simplified cfg but I am looking for a betterfaster approach.p

Negative 1871 pI am using Spring and JPA in my application, but lately I got a little confused with using collections from DomainObjects.p  pFor Examplep  pImagine we have two tables Parent and Child. A parent can have several Childs OneToMany and a child can only have one parent ManyToOne. I use Spring to handle my transaction context in my ServiceLayer not Dao  Unit of Work pattern, which is configured in contextapplication.xml by aopconfig. Children collections is marked as LazyLoading Collection. Everything worked fine until now.p  pThe problem now is the followingp  pI need a method in my service, which creates a new Parent and calling another method in same transaction to do some calculations with the newly created Parent. Within these calculations I have to call parent.getChildren. Obviously this should return an empty Set, since a new Parent cant have any Children at creationtime, but for some reason I get back null instead of an empty set, which results in a NullpointerExceptionp  pTo create a parent I tried the following EntityManager methodsp  ol liusing entityManager.persist parent   didnt work out, collection is null after creation.li liusing entityManager.merge parent  and return the new managed instance of parent  had the same result.li ol  pBoth resulted in a null set. But I am pretty sure, that these calls are within the same transaction, cause outside of a transaction I would receive a LazyLoadingException instead of NullPointer which is afaik correct at this point. On the other hand using an already existing parent with entityManager.findById resulted in an existing collection which means it works like expected.To fix the issue I tried several approaches until I found a working onep  pentityManager.refresh parent  after mergingpersisting worked out, since the collections get initialised when calling refresh.p  pBut within tutorials I never saw that this method is beeing used. In JavaDoc of EntityManager its been said, that merge returns the new managed beans, while persist makes the reference itself managed. I guessed managed would mean, that I can already use those Collections within a transaction. Why do the collections not getting initialized at creation time Do i have to initialize them by myself in constructor of Parent for examplep  pI wonder, if I did anything wrong, or is it the right way to call refresh after I created a new Instance of Parent If so guess I just have to seperate between persist and update like it is recommended in the following article a hrefhttpblog.xebia.com20090323jpaimplementationpatternssavingdetachedentities relnofollowJPA Implemenentationsa and refresh the newly created object after persist Or should I just refresh the Object, when I really need to use the Collectionp  pHope you could follow me and I would appreciate any recommendations or solutions for me to get clearer on that point.p  pThank you very much,br ymenep

Negative 1871 pI am in the process of writing a Ruby scriptapp that helps me compiling LaTeX to at least PDF. One feature I want it to have is that it should run codepdflatexcode iteratively until the PDF converges as it should, I guess. p  pThe idea is to compare the PDF generated in one iteration against the one from the former iteration using their fingerprints. In particular, I currently use codeDigestMD5.file.code.p  pThe problem now is that this never converges. A The, hopefully culprit is the PDFs timestamp that is set to the seconds at least by codepdflatexcode. Since runs of codepdflatexcode take typically longer than one second, the result keeps changing. That is, I expect the PDFs to be equal up to the timestamps after some point. This assumption might be wrong hints appreciated.p  pWhat can I do about this My basic ideas so farp  ul liUse a library capable of doing the jobli liStrip meta data away and only hash PDF contentli liOverwrite timestamps by a fixed value before comparingli ul  pDo you have more ideas or even solutions Solutions should only use free software that runs on Linux. Such that only use Ruby are preferred, but using external software is perfectly acceptable.p  pBy the way, I do not exactly know how PDF is encoded but I suspect that merely comparing the contained text wont work for me since only graphics or links might change in later iterations.p  pPossibly related p  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions145657howtocomparetwopdffilesHow to compare two PDF filesa Messy, textbased or proprietary solutionsli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1923288functionalpdftestingautomatetestingofpdfcontentFunctional PDF Testinga Uses a Java library not clear wether it is up to the jobli ul

Negative 1871 pI have an application on a Parallax BASIC Stamp board that reads text commands and executes test cases based on the commands.  One test case that sends data via the SPI bus and reads from the SPI bus is failing, depending upon the burst rate of the DEBUGIN text.  p  pThe Stamp Board is connected to a PC Quad core 2 GHZ, through serial port at 19200 baud.  p  pWhen I use the BASIC Stamp Terminal or Hyper Terminal to send commands to the Stamp Board, the test passes.  When I send the same commands via a C application, the test fails.  The primary difference is the burst rate at which the text is sent to the Stamp Board.  p  pHumans send text slower than computers the application.  When using Hyper Terminal, one character is sent at 19200 baud.  The application is sending 8 characters at 19200 baud with no pauses between characters.p  pIm looking for an explanation how the DEBUGIN statement input through the serial port affects the SHIFTIN or SHIFTOUT commands, or if anybody knows how to resolve this issue.p  pUnfortunately, the baud rate of the DEBUGIN command cannot be changed.  The alternative is have a custom version including conversion of text to numbers using the serial port command at a slower speed which uses extra valuable space, which there is little of on my project.p  pIf posting to StackEchange is the wrong forum, please migrate and post the reason it was migrated.p

Negative 1871 pIm creating piece of code to check mp3 files on my server and get result do some of them have false sync or not. In short, Im loading those files in PHP using a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.fread.php relnofollowfreada function and getting stream in variable. After splitting that stream to get separate streams for id3v1 not necessary, its not a subject of sync, id3v2 main problem and audio, I have to implement that scheme against id3v2 stream.p  h2According to a hrefhttpid3.orgid3v2.3.0 relnofollowID3v2 official documentationah2  pThe only purpose of the unsynchronisation scheme is to make the ID3v2 tag as compatible as possible with existing software. There is no use in unsynchronising tags if the file is only to be processed by new software. Unsynchronisation may only be made with MPEG 2 layer I, II and III and MPEG 2.5 files.p  pWhenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte. The format of a correct sync that should be altered by ID3 encoders is as follows p  blockquote   p11111111 111xxxxxp blockquote  pAnd should be replaced with p  blockquote   p11111111 00000000 111xxxxxp blockquote  pThis has the side effect that all FF 00 combinations have to be altered, so they wont be affected by the decoding process. Therefore all the FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the FF 00 00 combination during the unsynchronisation.p  pTo indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the first bit in ID3 flags should be set note Ive found that bit. This bit should only be set if the tag contains a, now corrected, false synchronisation. The bit should only be clear if the tag does not contain any false synchronisations.p  pDo bear in mind, that if a compression scheme is used by the encoder, the unsynchronisation scheme should be applied emafterwardsem. When decoding a compressed, unsynchronised file, the unsynchronisation scheme should be parsed first, decompression afterwards. p  h2My questions areh2  ol liHow to search amp replace this bitpattern code11111111 111xxxxxcode with code11111111 00000000 111xxxxxcodeli liVice versa, how to search amp replace this bitpattern code11111111 00000000 111xxxxxcode with code11111111 111xxxxxcodeli ol  pstrong...using a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.pregreplace.php relnofollowpregreplacea.strongp  pCode Ive created so far works perfectly and I have just one line more well, two exactly.p  precodeltphp     some basic checkings here, such as does file exist    and is it readable    f  fopentest.mp3, r     ...rest of my code...      pattern1    pattern from 1st question   id3stream  pregreplacepattern1, something1, id3stream     ...extracting frames...    pattern1    pattern from 2nd question   id3stream  pregreplacepattern2, something2, id3stream     ..do more job...    fclosef  gt codepre  pstrongHow to make those two lines with pregreplace function workstrongp  pP.S.

I find that the earlier I get a prototype UI infront of a client, the quicker they can look at it and evolve it into what they really want.p  pWhen I say clientheavy webforms, I mostly bind data clientside and then use web services to handle events from the client  the web services interact with my business layer and deal in JSON. The advantage comes when, say, one UI event requires that many controls be updated  I can then fall back on the asp.net page cycle and fire off a partialpostback having wrapped the various controls in update panels.p  pThe way I see it, I can have my cake and I can eat it I can use lightningfast JSON web services for performance critical areas of my app but I can revert to the postbackpartial postback model for complex UI areas. All in all, less development time and performant where it matters.p  pSo finally, a questionp  pIm not trying to resist MVC just simply asking is it better than what Im doing above and if so, why   p

I wanted to avoid writing seperate container classes for testing, and this is the an easy way I thought to not have test related code all over. p  pI could instead have subclassed ContainerFactory ie ContainerFactoryTesting extends ContainerFactory  and override in that instead of mixing test code with app code and cluttering method signatures with modenull, but that is not the point of this post. Moving on,  to create a container for a particular object, I simply do thisp  precode  returns container with DataFactory dependencies, holds db and logger objects.  dataFactoryContainer  new ContainerFactoryDataFactory   returns container with test settings. dataFactoryTestContainer  new ContainerFactoryDataFactory,test   returns container with DbConnect dependencies, holds dbconfig and logger objects. dbConnectContainer  new ContainerFactoryDbConnect codepre  pI just ran into an issue that makes suspect the strategy I am building upon is flawed.p  pLooking at the above, DataFactory contains db object that holds database connections. I am now refactoring out this dbclass to remove its dependencies on a registry object,  but how will I create dataFactoryContainer, when I add db object that needs dbConnectContainerp  pFor example, in datafactory container I add a dbconnect instance, but IT will now need a container passed to it ...p  pI realise my english is not that great and hope I have explained well enough for a fellow SOer to understand.p  pMy question is twofold, how do you guys handle creating objects for dependencies that themselves contain dependencies, in a simple mannerp  pAnd .. how do you seperate container configuration for creation of objects for testing purposesp  pAs always, any comment or link to relevant post appreciated.p

If subclasses want to customize behavior during initialization which they commonly do they can override this method. Since the default implementation does nothing, theres no need to remember to call code[super setup]code. p  pI like the way that this works so far, its robust and easy to use. The problem I have now is that there are times when the setup method requires some additional property to be set. An examplep  precodeimplimentation Metrics   idinitWithFrameCGRectframe    self  [super initWithFrameframe]   if self       Do all the required initialization      end  interface SubclassOfMetrics  Metrics   property assign CGFloat width  end  implimentation SubclassOfMetrics   voidsetup     This method is indirectly called as a result of the superclass initialization    The code here depends on the width property being set   end codepre  pThe problem I have is that setup is called before the property codewidthcode can be set. What options do I have here I can work around this by not initializing my codeMetricscode class in the init method. I can do it explicitly after I have set the properties I need to set. Im not of fan of this, as it requires me to perform actions in a certain order and remember to setup. Do I have any other optionsp  pEdit The root of problem is really that the initialization of the codeMetricscode class does a lot of calculations. The results of those calculations will depend on the properties being set in a subclass, so I need a way to get those properties set embeforeem the superclass is done initializing.p

Negative 1871 pI want to implement my own policy for DNS look up on Windows platform Server 2008, in more details, the customization I mean is when there is a request to look up IP for a host name comes for DNS server, my own customization logics inside DNS will be called e.g. find a low working load machine and return the IP address. My purpose is to implement a load balancer by using DNS customization.p  pIs there any APISDK of Server 2008 which could implement my goal or there is a way to implement a DNS from scratch and host on Windows Server if there is any open source light weighted DNS on Windows which could be easily customized for my purpose, it will be greatp  pBTW either APISDKopen source on C or CC are ok for me.p

Negative 1871 pI am a bit confused about how differently the jQuery append and the Javascript appendChild functions handle an Element that calls the document.write function within. p  pHeres my HTML Code p  precodeltdiv idmainareagt ltdivgt  ltdiv idtempareagt     ltdiv idcontentgt         ltscriptgt             document.writeLorem Ipsum Dolor...         ltscriptgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI basically want to put the whole Element content and all its Contents, including the Lorem Ipsum Javascript Bit from temparea to mainarea. My first approach was simple jQueryp  precodetarget  jQuerymainarea content  jQuerycontent target.appendcontent codepre  pThis works, but with one exception the Lorem Ipsum Dolor text is written once in the content Element where it belongs, now within the mainarea div, AND once beneath both divs at the bottom of the page without the content div wrapping the text. Of course, I want the text to be shown only once, within the content div. If I write the Lorem Ipsum text as static HTML, the whole thing works just fine, so its got to have something to do with the document.write function and how this affects the DOM Tree, right So i experimented a little more and came to this solutionp  precodetarget  jQuerymainarea.get0 content  jQuerycontent.get0 target.appendChildcontent codepre  pWith this Code, the Lorem Ipsum Text is only written once in the HTML Document, and exactly where i want it to be. Problem solved.p  pBut i dont get how and why this approach works and the other one doesnt. So Im not asking for a solution to my problem, but for an explanation as to why both approaches handle things so differently to understand whats going on here. Is there perhaps a wholly different solution to the scenario that Im missing and thats easier to understand p  pi tested in firefox and operap  pThanksp

I have been doing some work on asset resources e.g. javascripts in a vendor plugins assets directory and hate having to restart webrick every time I change a file to get it copied over to the appropriate location in the public assets folder. p  pe.g. from vendorPLUGINassets to publicpluginassetsPLUGINp  pIm trying to figure out what task the server script fires off to accomplish this so that I can add a shortcut task in my IDE. We are moving to Rails 3.1 at some point, but for now I need something quick and dirty that doesnt require changing the code base or introducing dependencies. Anybody know where this is done I might end up debugging the damn thing to see where this happens or right a simple cp r type script. Surely there must be something easier though ...p

Negative 1871 pUsing SWT and Java, I have a Text widget defined which is set for multiline and wrap properties. I added a listener which will monitor any changes to the text inside this text widget, and I want the height of the widget to automatically change if the user adds a new line of text, or if the text wraps around to the next line. So, I want all of the text visible in the text widget if the user adds new text, or deletes text. Heres a sample of what Im trying to dop  precodemTextValue  new TextcompositeEditor, SWT.BORDER  SWT.WRAP  SWT.MULTI mTextValue.setBackgroundSWTResourceManager.getColorSWT.COLORWHITE mTextValue.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1  mTextValue.addListenerSWT.Modify,new Listener      protected int lines1     public void handleEventEvent e                           Text text  Text e.widget         int newlines  text.getLineCount                         if newlineslines            linesnewlines     height  lines16     width  240     text.setSizewidth,height     text.getShell.packtrue     codepre  pNow, this seems to work ok if I add a single line of text and press the return key to add the next line.

I want to keep the width fixed, and only self adjust the height.p  pCan anyone offer a suggestion to how I can have the text widget self adjust its height to fit all of the entered text, but keep the width of the text widget always fixed at a prescribed valuep  pThanks.p

Negative 1871 pI am using Lucene.net to index a product catalog.

Negative 1871 pI dont understand whats the difference between those patterns Martin Fowler says p  blockquote   pTransaction Script organizes business logic by procedures where each procedure handles a single request from the presentation.p blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pTable Module a single instance that handles the business logic for all rows in a database table or view.p blockquote  pAlsop  blockquote   pYou can organize your Transaction Scripts into classes in two ways. The most common is to have several Transaction Scripts in a single class, where each class defines a subject area of related Transaction Scripts. This is straightforward and the best bet for most cases. The other way is to have each Transaction Script in its own class Figure 9.1, using the Command pattern [Gang of Four].p blockquote  pSo I can do that in Table Module I can have method for each presentation request, aslo I can use DataSet or RecordSet in Transaction Script pattern. Well how should I know which pattern should I use in my domain logicp

Negative 1871 pWhile debugging the code in Eclipse, I runned into the following problem. There is a WHILE Loop with possibly 10,000 iterations. Therefore, its not a good idea to use Step here. So, I placed the Breakpoint right after this WHILE Loop. But it seems that this WHILE Loop runned into the internal loop. I dont know how to find the right iteration that caused this problem. Is there any way to differentiate between the long execution time of the code and the internal loop What should I do to quickly find such deadlock places in the codep  pP.S.

Negative 1871 pIm having an odd issue in FF10 using jQuery 1.7.1. I have a gallery which may have scaled down images, some of them can be scaled quite a bit from their original dimensions.p  pWhat happens is that sometimes, the image will zoom or jump to one side when I try to animate its opacity using jQuery.p  pFor an example, have a look here at one of the small ones, and mouse over it a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netZUWkh relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netZUWkhap  pIt can be very subtle but you can see the image change when the opacity is animated  it only seems to affect images that have been scaled down beyond a certain point, as I cant see it happening to the bigger image on this example.p  pAny ideas what is happening, and how to overcome itp  pIm scaling them like this just to fit them into rows in the gallery  the sizes are worked out with PHP and are proportional. I could use CSS instead if theres a difference.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The problem changes if you resize the browser window, or zoom in  out  it doesnt get solved but the images that get bumped change, so that some of them are fine afterwards and some that were fine now jump when animated.p  pstrongAnother updatestrong Im also noticing that this seems to affect antialiasing, as the images that are faded out seem to be jaggy, but are smooth when at full opacity. Something new in FF to make images look prettier maybep  pstrongYet another updatestrong Just tested on Chrome, Safari on Mac and IE7 on XP, this issue ONLY happens on FF10 on Mac dont know about other platforms or versions. Wierd... p  pstrongYet another yet another updatestrong Just tested on XP with FF9, this issue doesnt happen. I then updated this to FF10, and the issue appears.

Negative 1871 pI have a product listing page and want to load up a detail view for each product via AJAX and display it within the page. I have a more complex set of conditions I want to set up animations with, but Ill keep it simple here.p  pBasically, upon click, I want to run the AJAX request and simultaneously animate in some cases, a series of animations... the content wrapper open and show a loading state. Once BOTH of those are done, I then want to drop in, and animate the content. I thought jQuery Deferred Objects would be the way to go, but I dont have a good grasp on them and my attempts havent gotten me where I want to be.p  pI tried something like thisp  precodevar dfr  .Deferred dfr.thenfunction  return wrapper.fadeIn5000   .whendfr, .getdetail.html .thenfunction      console.logAll done, run additional animations...   dfr.resolve codepre  p... but it gets triggered as soon as the AJAX request is done, even if the animation is still running.p  pI also tried thisp  precodevar dfr  .Deferred dfr.thenfunction  return wrapper.fadeIn5000  dfr.thenfunction  return .getdetail.html  dfr.donefunction  console.logAll done, run additional animations...  dfr.resolve codepre  p... but that just executes all of the codethencodecodedonecode calls simultaneously. I also tried switching in codepipecode in place of the codethencode calls, to no avail.p  pI would love to understand Deferred Objects is this even an appropriateintended use for them.. and, of course, how I can achieve my goals for this page.

Negative 1871 pI need to download some images from server. So I created a seperate class to handle NSURLConnection delegates.  At the end of codedidFinishDownloadingDatacode, I called a delegate method like  code[iddelegate performSelectorselectorfinished withObjectreceivedData]code  I have a view controller called codeListImagescode. I created the above connection class from ListImages class and assigned codeconnection.delegate  selfcode. After image loaded from server the method codevoiddidFinishDownloadingDataNSData datacode was called successfully, and I could display that image. p  pMy problem starts now. To handle some common tasks, I created a new class called codeSharedMethodscode which is a subclass of codeNSObjectcode. I allocated connection class asp  precode  Connection conn  [[Connection alloc]init]    conn.delegate   self   [conn startDownload]  called a method which starts nsurlconnection. codepre  pI am using ARC so not released that object.

I dont think I have released anything because I am using ARC. p  pThere was also a problem while callingcodeUIAlerViewcode delegates inside a Class which is a subclass of NSobject. It is not called any how. My doubt is, is there any problem with using a codeNSObjectcode sublass Is there anything to consider when using codeNSObjectcode sublass  Thanks in advance.p

As I understand it, they must be unique, not change, and represent any configuration of an object as a single number.p  pMy first question is that for my object, containing the two Int16s codeacode and codebcode, is it safe for my codeGetHashCodecode to return something like codea  n  bcode where n is a large number, I think perhaps codeMath.Pow2, 16codep  pAlso codeGetHashCodecode appears to inflexibly return specifically the type Int32.p  p32bits can just about store, for example, two Int16s, a single unicode character or 16 N, S, E, W compass directions, its not much, even something like a small few node graph would probably be too much for it.

And if you use Express.js is because it offers more tools than Node.js, like authentication, session control, data base,etc.p  pHow do you mix it up i have seen some examples on internet like this book OReilly Mediap  pa hrefhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentals relnofollowhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentalsap  pspecifically, on their github source code related to option7 for a TodoList app.p  pHere, they mix up both technologies Backbone.js and Express.js with MongoDB. They do data persistant between client and server, connection to Redis, etc, Bbut i still dont understand why they use Jade and views for main HTML templating on Express.js, but CSS, jQuery and images inside public on Backbone.js.B p  pShouldnt we build up the HTML5,CSS3 and JS entirely in Backbone.js Whats the point of inyecting HTML templates from the backend through ROUTES, if you want all your MVC on the frontendp  pthank you very much and hope to get an answer p

Negative 1871 pIve written a bash logging library to be implemented with some complex scripts that my company is currently using. Ive been deadset on providing the script filename BASHSOURCE and the line number LINENO of the calling script when making the log calls. However, I didnt want to have to rely on the user or implementing script to pass in these two variables as parameters. If this were CC, I would just create a macro that prepends FILE and LINE to the parameter list.p  pI was finally able to get this part working. Here are some muchsimplified abstracts as a proof of conceptp  pHeres the logging libraryp  precode log.sh  LOGeval log BASHSOURCE LINENO  log       BASHSOURCEbasename 1 ampamp shift     LINENO1 ampamp shift      echo BASHSOURCELINENO   codepre  pAnd an implementing test scriptp  precode MyTest.sh  . .log.sh  LOG This is a log message  test.sh5 This is a log message codepre  pThis works pretty well and, I was thrilled to get it working at first. However, this has one glaring problem the interaction between quotes and eval. If I make the callp  precodeLOG Im thrilled that I got this working  .test.sh eval line 5 unexected EOF while looking for matching   .test.sh eval line 6 syntax error unexpected end of file codepre  pNow, I believe that I understand why this is happening. The quoted parameters are kept intact as theyre passed to eval, but at that point, the content is placed asis into the resulting command string. I know that I can fix this by doing some escaping however, I strongemREALLYemstrong do not want to force the implementing scripts to have to do this. Before I implemented this eval macro capability, I had users make calls directly to log and allowed them to optionally pass in LINENO. With this implementation, The failing call above with only a quoted sentence worked just fine.p  pAt the most basic level, all I really want is for a script to be able to call em[log functionmacro] String to log with special characersem and have the resulting log message contain the filename and line number of the calling script, followed by the log message. If its possible, I would assume that Im very close, but if theres something Im overlooking that would require a different approach, Im open to that as well. I cant force the users to escape all of their messages, as that will likely cause them to not use this library. This is such a problem that if I cant find a solution to this, Ill likely revert to the old capability which required LINENO to be passed as a function parameter  this was much less intrusive.p  pstrongTLDRstrong Is there any way to get eval to respect special characters within a quoted parameter, without having to escape themp
Negative 1871   pQGraphicsPixmapItem, like QGraphicsItem, has a method updatex0, y0, width, height, in order to redraw a pixmap only partly on a QGraphicsScene. Calling this will schedule a paint in Qts event loop on the QGraphicsItem, and after this paint is executed the boundingbox x,y,width,height will be redrawn to the QGraphcisScene.p  pThe unfortunate part is that there is no way to schedule the paintevent with a boundingbox, meaning that QGraphicsPixmapItempaint is forced to repaint the whole QPixmap, therefore reimplementing this paintmethod in a subclass gives no way to only partly update the QPixmap, therefore making a small local update to the QPixmap unacceptably slow.p  pSuch a subclass would look something like thisp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeclass LocallyUdatablePixmapItem  public QGraphicsPixmapItem  private     QImage ampimage public     LocallyUdatablePixmapItemQImage ampimg  QGraphicsPixmapItem, imageimg       paintQPainter painter, const QStyleOptionGraphicsItem option, QStyle widget           locall update, unfortunately without a boundig box  therefore gt slow       codepre  p Another option would be to keep the internal QPixmap of the QGraphicsPixmapItem, and draw the QImage to it partly, like thisp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodesome initialization of variables QGraphicsScene scene  ...

Negative 1871 pIve been thinking about creating a database that, instead of having a table per object I want to represent, would have a series of generic tables that would allow me to represent anything I want and even modifying thats actually my main interest the data associated with any kind of object I represent.p  pAs an example, lets say Im creating a web application that would let people make appointments with hairdressers. What I would usually do is having the following tables in my database p  ul liclientsli lihairdressers FK id of the company the hairdresser works for li licompaniesli liappointments FK id of the client and the hairdresser for that appointmentli ul  pBut what happens if we deal with scientific hairdressers that want to associate more data to an appointment e.g. quantity of shampoo used, grams of hair cut, number of scissors strokes,... p  pI was thinking instead of that, I could use the following tablesp  ul lientity represents anything I want. PKentityidli ligroup is an entity when I create a group, I first create an entity which  id is then referred to by the FK of the group. PKgroupid, FKentityidli lientitygroup each group can contain multiple entity thus also other groups PKentityid, groupid.li lirole e.g. Administrator, Client, HairDresser, Company. PKroleidli lientityrole each entity can have multiple roles PKentityid, roleidli limetadata contains the name and type of the metadata aswell as the associated role and a flag that describes if its mandatory or not. PKmetadataid, FKmetadatatypeid, roleidli limetadatatype contains information about available metadata types. PKmetadatatypeid li limetadatavalue PKmetadatavalueid, FKmetadataidli limetadataem different tables for the different types e.g. char, text, integer, double, datetime, date. PKmetadataemid, FKmetadatavalueid which contain the actual value of a metadata associated with an entity.li lientitymetadata contains data associated with an entity e.g. name of a client, address of a company,... PKentityid, metadatavalueid. Using the type of the metadata, its possible to select the actual value of a metadata for this entity in the corresponding table.li ul  pThis would allow me to have a completely flexible data structure but has a few drawbacksp  ul liSelecting the metadatas associated with an entity returns multiple rows that I have to process in my code to create the representation of the entity in my code.li liSelecting metadatas of multiple entities requires to loop over the same process as above.li liSelecting metadatas will also require me to do a select for each one of the metadata table that I have.li ul  pOn the other hand, it has some advantages. For example, instead of having a client table with a lot of fields that will almost never be filled, I just use the exact number of rows that I need.p  pIs this a good idea at allp  pI hope that Ive expressed clearly what Im trying to achieve. I guess that Im not the first one who wonders how to achieve that but I was not able to find the right keywords to find an answer to that question p  pThanksp

Negative 1871 pIm trying to write a piece of code that periodically tries to connect to the server using QTcpSocket until the server is up and ready. The client should also automatically and periodically try reconnecting when the server is down until it is up again or user manually closes the program.p  pWhat I have done is subscribing to the connected and error signals of QTcpSocket. When I catch the error signal, I basically call connectToHost method again. p  pMy code periodically tries to connect to the host until the server is ready this part works fine. However, the problem is when the server is down it can never reconnect. When the connection is down I get RemoteHostClosedError as expected. But, after calling the connectToHost method again inside the same method where I catch RemoteHostClosedError I got nothing. Even the error signal is not emitted by the QTcpSocket object. p  pI gave my code below.p  precodeTcpServerConnectorTcpServerConnector SocketSettings socketSettings, QObject parent  QObjectparent, socketnew QTcpSocket      thisgtconnectthisgtsocket, SIGNALconnected, this, SLOTconnectionSuccessHandler, QtDirectConnection     thisgtconnectthisgtsocket, SIGNALerrorQAbstractSocketSocketError, this, SLOTconnectionErrorHandlerQAbstractSocketSocketError, QtDirectConnection    void TcpServerConnectorconnectionErrorHandler QAbstractSocketSocketError error       switch error          case QAbstractSocketAddressInUseError         thisgtlogger.logLogLevelERR, SOCKET ERROR Address is already in use         break     case QAbstractSocketConnectionRefusedError         thisgtlogger.logLogLevelERR, SOCKET ERROR Connection refused         break     case QAbstractSocketHostNotFoundError         thisgtlogger.logLogLevelERR, SOCKET ERROR Host not found         break     case QAbstractSocketRemoteHostClosedError         thisgtlogger.logLogLevelERR, SOCKET ERROR Remote host closed                     break              thisgtsocketgtabort     thisgtsocketgtclose     thisgtlogger.logLogLevelDEBUG, Reconnecting...     SystemUtilsleepCurrentThread1000     thisgtsocketgtconnectToHostipaddress, port  codepre  pp  pI check the state of the QTcpSocket before and after calling the connectToHost method the last line I gave here. Before calling connectToHost the state is UnconnectedState and after calling connectToHost its state becomes Connecting. Nothing unexpected. However, neither it can connect to the server, nor emit an error signal.p  pAny ideap  pNote The connectToHost metod of QTcpSocket is called internally for the first time. p

Negative 1871 pIm building a complex application in JavaScript which needs to make several requests to the server. Sometimes that request cannot be completed as sent, and addition information is needed. I would like the ability to have the server inform the application in the requests response that more information is needed and to describe how to retrieve that information. p  pFor example, say a user tries to perform an operation that his current permissions level does not allow. The server needs to ask the application for an override authorization code, basically meaning the application needs to pop up with a dialog asking for an admin passcode. p  pId like to have some kind of framework that abstracts all this. Possible a main Request or Operation class, which I can define subRequest classes that define possible interpretations of requests. Im not sure if something like this exists already or not. p  pSo I guess my questions are 1 Does a framework like this exists and 2 Are there any articles on this topic platform and language agnostic, I can learn how they work from any source. I know frameworks like Dojo and ExtJS use something like it for their data stores, but Im not sure if its exactly what im needing, or how it even works for that matter. p  pAny help leading me in the right direction is appreciated, Thank You.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pA point should be made I am looking for something that is abstract from the technology used to actually send that data to the server.

An example of this would bep  precode     type 512,     success true,     data  some data   codepre  pI know I have to design the protocol itself, but what I need help with is creating a class or something that interprets this protocol automatically instead of just making redundant codeonSuccesscode callbacksp
Negative 1871 pI have been happily using JQM for awhile now.  However I recently started a new project which required dynamically created pages to be pushed into the history with their content determined by url parameters.  I am going to show you how I originally approached controllers with JQM and how I have tried to approach the router plugin.p  pThis is how I used to write all my controllers for JQMp  precodemyApp.foo.controller  function      use strict      var page      var init  function              page  foopage         applyBindings           var applyBindings  function                      Page transition events         page.bindpagebeforeshow, onPageBeforeShow           var onPageBeforeShow  function                  return           init init        jQuery  foopage.livepageinit, functione      myApp.foo.controller.init  codepre  pSo I am now using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comazicchettijquerymobilerouter relnofollowJQM recommended routing plugina.  I am not using spine or backbone.  And I dont want to get this wrong as its fundamental to the app.  So I load all my controllers and then load my router.js file.p  pThis gives me the behaviour im expectingp  precode    var router  new .mobile.Router[         foopage eventsi, handler myApp.foo.controller.init,         foopage eventss, handler myApp.foo.controller.onPageShow,                    dynamicfoo[]. eventsi, handler myApp.dynamicFoo.controller.init,         dynamicfoo[]. eventsbs, handler myApp.dynamicFoo.controller.onPageBeforeShow,     ] codepre  pBut Is this the right way to use the router plugin  Because I read the documentation and the author seems to use the router object as the actual controller. p  pTo be clear, this works for me Im just not sure if this is really the idea of routing or perhaps this is the wrong approachp

Negative 1871 pIm trying to measure a performance difference between using Boost.Variant and using virtual interfaces. For example, suppose I want to increment different types of numbers uniformly, using Boost.Variant I would use a boostvariant over int and float and a static visitor which increments each one of them. Using class interfaces I would use a pure virtual class number and numberint and numberfloat classes which derive from it and implement an increment method.brbr From my testing, using interfaces is far faster than using Boost.Variant.

Negative 1871 pI find myself using jQuery objects with regular js objects often Im trying to figure out how I can utilize .call and .apply more often in my scripts when appropriate.  Ive been testing code to see how it actually works.p  pHowever when I run my code below which essentially just hides all the divs on the page in firebug on sites I know have jQuery I get varied results Im wondering if its the version of jQuery or is this code just buggy I am to decipher why .call always works but .apply doesnt thought it would be the other way around based on code belowp  precodevar myApp    instantiate an empty objct myApp.hide  function whatever     that  whatever    that.hide  var Numbers  function object  this.object  object   Numbers.prototype.div  div var numbers  new Numbers numbers.div myApp.hide.callnumbers, numbers.div myApp.hide.applynumbers, numbers.div codepre  pWhen I firebug the code above either using .call or .apply I get different result depending upon the site.  Every site that has jquery .call will work but for some sites like jQuery.com and twitter both will work using .apply and .call but other sites like New York Times and Netflix only .call works  Im guessing its the version of jQuery thats causing the difference but am slightly confused because numbers.div always returns an array of all div elements on the page so I would think that would work all the time.

Negative 1871 pI am looking at developing on an FPGA, but it would be easier for me to write the code in Python or Scala and have it converted to VHDL or Verilog.p  pI want to have many sensors hooked up to a device, and as the data comes in, calculations are done very quickly so it can be displayed on a video wall, so the FPGA would have as input dozens of sensors and several video controllers for the wall.p  pThis is a library for code written in Scala.  For this one I am curious if the code is written in Java and Scala would that affect what it generates.p  pa hrefhttpsimplifide.comdrupal6 relnofollowhttpsimplifide.comdrupal6ap  pThis is a python to VHDL converter.p  pa hrefhttpwww.myhdl.orgdoku.php relnofollowhttpwww.myhdl.orgdoku.phpap  pWith both of these I am curious as to the limitations.  p  pI would prefer simplifide, as I am stronger at Scala than Python, but it seems that myhdl may be a more robust platform, just from some basic looking around.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe reason for the FPGA is that it can do multiple tasks at one time very well, so when the data comes in, depending on the needs of users, based on the experiment, it would be easy to change the code on the FPGA to be able to adapt to the needs.  p  pSo, for example, if you have 8 x 3 different weather sensors on each floor of an office building, so there are temperature, wind speed, barometric sensors 8 of each sensor one each floor, and add sensors to test the deformation of the walls, then a realtime interface to read these in at the same time and keep updating the visual display may be helpful.p  pThis is a made up example, but it would explain why an FPGA would be useful, otherwise I would need many different DSPs and then feed that into a computer to do the visual display, whereas an FPGA can do is faster, since it is hardware, with lower power needs.p  pThere are two opensource libraries that can help make this easier in development, but I am not certain which would be a better platform to use to convert a program to VHDLVerilog.p  pThis is just one example.  If I want to do a quantum circuit simulation on an FPGA, as this article suggests a hrefhttpwww.cc.gatech.educomputingnanodocumentsRadecka2020FPGA20Emulation20of20Quantum20Circuits.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cc.gatech.educomputingnanodocumentsRadecka2020FPGA20Emulation20of20Quantum20Circuits.pdfa then it would be easier to do this as a program, than building up a large circuit by hand.p

Negative 1871 pThis is a question for those who have a good understanding of VHDL. Im a newbie but so far I have been generating VHDL using a behavioral description. For me it is much easier to think about as it is similar to writing software. I am aware that a possible downfall is that behavioral executes sequentially while structural executes concurrently within the design componentprocess..p  pSo Im just curious, if I have an architecture that uses a process for say an 8bit shift register SISO and I want to create 4 instances of these 4x8bit shift registers would I create a component and 4 instances of the processp  pOr would I generate 4 processes executing in parallel to one another and just call each process by a different namep  pAlso, just a general question to get a consensus of what good practices people use out there, which do you prefer structural vs. behavioral When would be a good time to choose one over the other Im guessing their could be some benefits with faster execution using components that allow internal concurrency vs. sequential execution in processes.. It sure does seem to me though that one could reduce the design time with behavioral designs..p  pThanks doddyp

Negative 1871 pI have view which contains a collection view.  I have added this collection view programatically in viewDidLoad  so that is not on the storyboard.

After updating the arrangement worked fine but with one problem. After keeping the application on browser for 10 to 15 minutes one particular page start to crash. On investigating I found that for that page client is requesting server for some data but server is responding with older version of the same class existing with the client as a stub.   This error doesnt occur before this 10 minute time out.  Server returns same class version as that is with client.

Negative 1871 pI have an inhouse distributed computing library that we use all the time for parallel computing jobs. After the processes are partitioned, they run their data loading and computation steps and then finish with a save step. Usually this involved writing data to database tables.p  pBut for a specific task, I need the output of each process to be a .png file with some data plots. There are 95 processes in total, so 95 .pngs.p  pInside of my save step executed on each process, I have some very simple code that makes a boxplot with matplotlibs codeboxplotcode function and some code that uses codesavefigcode to write it to a .png file that has a unique name based on the specific data used in that process.p  pHowever, I occasionally see output where it appears that two or more sets of data were written into the same output file, despite the unique names.p  pDoes matplotlib use temporary file saves when making boxplots or saving figures If so, does it always use the same temp file names thus leading to overwrite conflicts I have run my process using codestracecode and cannot see anything that obviously looks like temp file writing from matplotlib.p  pHow can I ensure that this will be threadsafe I definitely want to conduct the file saving in parallel, as I am looking to expand the number of output .pngs considerably, so the option of first storing all the data and then just serially executing the plotsave portion is very undesirable.p  pIts impossible for me to reproduce the full parallel infrastructure we are using, but below is the function that gets called to create the plot handle, and then the function that gets called to save the plot. You should assume for the sake of the question that the thread safety has nothing to do with our distributed library. We know its not coming from our code, which has been used for years for our multiprocessing jobs without threading issues like this especially not for something we dont directly control, like any temp files from matplotlib.p  precodeimport pandas import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  def plotcategorydatabetas, categoryname          Function to organize beta data by date into vectors and pass to box plot     code for producing a single chart of multiperiod box plots.          betavectorlist  []     yms  np.sortbetas.yearmonth.unique     for ym in yms         betavectorlist.appendbetas[betas.yearmonthym].Beta.values.flatten.tolist           plotoutput  plt.boxplotbetavectorlist     axs  plt.gcf.gca     axs.setxticklabelsbetas.FactorDate.unique, rotation40, horizontalalignmentright     axs.setxlabelDate     axs.setylabelBeta     axs.settitles Beta to BMI Globalcategoryname     axs.setylim1.0, 3.0      return plotoutput  End plotcategorydata  def saveself          Make calls to store the plot to the desired output file.          outfile  self.outputpath  s.pngself.categoryname     fig  plt.gcf     fig.setfigheight6.5     fig.setfigwidth10     fig.savefigoutfile, bboxinchestight, dpi150     print Finished and stored output file soutfile     return None  End save codepre

Negative 1871 pI am trying to automate the buildpublish of a large project implemented in Classic ASP using CodeCharge 4.3.p  pI know Classic ASP is a scripting language and our application is not really compiled per se, but during the publish process, the CodeCharge ID can detect pages that have become corrupted which is unfortunately a common event for us.  I want to hook this into TeamCity for CI.p  pCodeCharge has no commandline interface, hence the need to automate the UI,p  pIve been using the .NET UIAutomation clasess and have successfully managed to get the IDE to load, trigger a publish, capture the output from the output window, and then exit.p  pTo trigger the publish Im sending an F9 keypress using a hrefhttpinputsimulator.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpinputsimulator.codeplex.coma.  Im not entirely happy with this because it falls over if CodeCharge loses focus.  Is there a way to use UIAutomation to send an F9 keypress to a window irrespective of whether it has the focusp  pPublish can also be triggered from a toolbar, a menu, or a contextmenu attached to a treeview.  I have not had much luck with any of these because these elements dont seem to be exposed.  For example, using inspect.exe, I can find the toolbar NameStandard, ClassnameCCSToolbarWindow but neither inspect.exe or my UIAutomation application see anything below that.  The only pattern inspect.exe sees available on the toolbar element is IsLegacyIAccessiblePatternAvailable  True.  I suppose I could potentially send a leftclick event to the toolbar at specific coordinates, but this is getting out of my league.p  pI think because this application is quite old, I might have to look at the unmanaged UIAutomation stuff, or get deeper into the Win32 API or something if I was to continue to pursue, but I was hoping for a simpler solution.p

Negative 1871 pI am making a program that distributes a task. I have arraylist of communicator objects like sop  precodeArrayListltWorkersgt codepre  pI am working my way through a file, dividing it into fixed size chunks and dispatching to the various Workers. I am using an iterator to pass the chunks to the workers evenly. Usually there are more chunks than workers so i need to loop around and around my workers. How do i do this, my current solution uses an iterator like so.p  precode    private Worker getNextWorker      if workerIterator  null         workerIterator  workers.iterator      if workerIterator.hasNext         workerIterator  workers.iterator      return workerIterator.next  codepre  pI synchronised the method as well as the methods modify the arraylist however this doesnt make it safe as another thread can come in and modify the collection between iterator calls. Therefore i syncronised the entire file splitting process to make it one large atomic statement.p  p1 Have i missed anythingp  p2 Is there another, perhaps better way i get can this loop around functionality.p

Negative 1871 pI have a jQuery UI Autocomplete text field with a remote datasource. The autocompletes codeselectcode event does three thingsp  ol liUpdates the text fields value with the one selected from the autocomplete listli liMakes an AJAX call to load some more data into the pageli liMoves focus to another text field created in the previous stepli ol  pThe text field also has a codechangecode event that removes the data loaded in step 2 above and triggers the autocompletes codesearchcode event.p  pThis works perfectly in IE tested with versions 9 and 10, but not in Firefox. When I make a selection from the autocomplete list, the extra data is never shown though analysing the network traffic shows that the AJAX call is being made and the autocompletes codesearchcode event is triggered. I managed to track the problem down to Firefox triggering the text fields codechangecode event after step 3 above, apparently because I typed something into the text field to trigger the autocomplete list, and despite the fact that the text field was later updated programmatically.p  pQuick example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2umrJ1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net2umrJ1abr For the sake of brevity that example just uses a codekeyupcode event on the text field.p  pOutput in IE10p  blockquote   pinput1.focus triggeredbr   input1.blur triggeredbr   input2.focus triggeredp blockquote  pOutput in Firefox 20p  blockquote   pinput1.focus triggeredbr   input1.change triggeredbr   input1.blur triggeredbr   input2.focus triggeredp blockquote  pAs can be seen, Firefox fires the codechangecode event while IE doesnt. Now I know that by default i.e. without any extra code the codechangecode event is only triggered when the value was changed manually, but what is the correct behaviour when the value is changed emboth manually and programmaticallyem without the field losing focus in betweenp  pAlso, more importantly for my particular case, if Firefoxs behaviour is correct or at least not incorrect, whats the best way to prevent it I dont want the codechangecode event to be triggered when focus is being changed programmatically, after I selected something from the autocomplete list.p

Negative 1871 pI have a slightly long conceptual question Im wondering if somebody could help me out with.  p  pIn MVC Ive built a website which builds grids using a hrefhttpdemos.kendoui.comwebgridindex.html relnofollowkendouis frameworka.  p  pAll the grids on my website are constructed exactly the same except for the model they use and the CRUD methods that need to be implemented for each model.  I set things up where each Model implement an interface for CRUD methods like below to get the logic all in one place.p  precodeActual interface has variables getting passed public interface IKendoModelInterface       void Save     void Read     void Delete   public class Model1 IKendoModelInterface        [Key]     public int IdProperty1  get set       public int SomeProperty2  get set       public string SomeProperty3  get set       public void Save         Implement Save           public void Read         Implement Read           public void Delete         Implement Delete       codepre  pThen to speed up the writing of all the scaffolding Action methods needed to get the grids to work I created an abstract Controller that can call the interface methods of the Model that gets passed into it.  p  precode    Implement the AJAX methods called by the grid     public abstract class KendoGridImplControllerltTgt  Controller where T  class, IKendoModelInterface       Method called from kendo grid     public virtual ActionResult Create[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request, [BindPrefix  models]IEnumerableltTgt createdRecords               Invoke Create Method for Model and return results            public virtual ActionResult Read[DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest request, int Id            Invoke read method for model and return results          Update and Delete also implemented..    codepre  pThen I just need a Controller per model that implements the abstract controller above passing in the type of Model being used.p  precode     public class ResponsibilityMatrixController   KendoGridImplControllerltModel1gt     Set up the page the grid will be on      public ActionResult Indexint id               return ViewSharedGridView, id          Can override abstract methods if needed but usually wont need to  codepre  pIm wondering if I can take this one step further or if Ive reached the end of the road.  To me it just seems like more repeated code if I have to create a controller per Model that does nothing but pass in the type to the abstract controller and calls the same View.  p  pI attempted for quite a while yesterday to figure out if I could dynamically assign the type to the abstract controller.  I setup something where I was sending back the type of model via strings and I could still invoke the methods needed.  Where it failed, was that the mapping could no longer be done on any of the controller actions by default since the type isnt known at compile time.  eg p  precodepublic virtual ActionResult Create[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request, [BindPrefix  models]IEnumerableltTgt createdRecords  codepre  pcreatedRecords cant be bound like this if T thats passed in is an interface and not the Model itself and Ive found no real way to map the form data to an instance of a type that isnt known at compile time.  p  pIm wondering if theres an easy way to do this mapping between an instance of the type of object getting passed in that I can figure out at runtime, if theres some other way to set this up that Im overlooking or if both those things are going to be way too much work and I should just not attempt something like this and build a controller per model like I do now p

Negative 1871 pAs we know, working with codeTBitmapcodes pixels codeBitmap.Canvas.Pixels[X,Y]code is very slow in the outofbox VCL. This has been caused by getter and setter of codePixelscode property inherited from codeTCanvascode, which encapsulates general WinGDI DC object and is not specific to MemDC of bitmap. p  pFor the DIB sectionbased bitmaps codebmDIBcode a a hrefhttpwww.efg2.comLabImageProcessingScanline.htm relnofollowwellknown workarounda exists, however I do not see the way to integrate the proper gettersetter in the VCL TBitmap class besides direct modification of library code, which proven to be real empain in the sternem when it comes to compiling against different VCL versions.p  pPlease advise if there is some hackish way to reach codeTBitmapCanvascode class and inject overriden methods into it.p

Negative 1871 pI have recently followed the common advice found on the internet on how to install Symfony2  in Netbeans 7.3 by pointing the configuration to the Symfony2 standard edition zip file.p  pNow Im following the book on the Symfony website to create the HelloBundle demo, and Im noticing some inconsistencies. p  pFirst, when running a Symfony command in Netbeans, the generate bundle does not work as the a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentbookpagecreation.html relnofollowbook says it shoulda. It forces me to use the dir option. Here are the parameters I had to addp  precodenamespaceAcmeHelloBundle formatyml  dirsrc codepre  pSecondly, I see the routing file that was created, but the route parameters are different than what the book says. First the term Pattern is used instead of Path. Further searching indicates that Pattern is an obsolete term and that Path is preferred now. If this is the case, then why is Pattern showing up in my files if Im using the most current version of the framework 2.3.1  Also, my routing file has the word Default in it while the book has Hello. Here is a copy of the output.p  precodeacmehellohomepage     pattern  helloname     defaults  controller AcmeHelloBundleDefaultindex  codepre  pFinally, the book is unclear as to whether or not creating the bundle also automatically creates the controller files. Is this the case I do not have HelloController.php file the books says I should be editing.p  pIm new to Symfony, but this feels a little off. If thats the case how do I configure it to work as it shouldp
Negative 1871 pI have a situation in which I would like to iterate through a schedPayments table that stores a schedule of payments corresponding with a client in the client table.

When the balance from the client table is greater than the supposed balance from the schedPayments table AND todays date is later than the date the payment was scheduled for, the status column in the clients table should be set to 0.p  pI may be completely off the wall with my solution, but I keep getting Error Code 1329.

Negative 1871 pThe C98 standard saysp  blockquote   p[temp.class.spec] Partial specialization declarations themselves are not found by name lookup.p blockquote  pIf this is also true for explicit specializations, this makes a forwarddeclaration of a class template explicitpartial specialization invisible.p  blockquote   p[temp.class.spec.match] When a class template is used in a context that requires an instantiation of the class, it is necessary to determine whether the instantiation is to be generated using the primary template or one of the partial specializations.p blockquote  pThis implies that the choice of explicitpartial specialization is not made until the point of implicit instantiation of a matching specialization  which only occurs when the class is required to be completely defined.p  pIn the following example, the only effect the forwarddeclared explicitspecializations have is to make the program fail to compile.p  precodenamespace N      templateltclass Tgt     struct S                typedef Sltchargt Type  name lookup finds SltTgt      templateltgt     struct Sltchargt  invisible to name lookup      typedef Sltchargt Type  name lookup finds SltTgt      int fSltchargt  name lookup finds SltTgt      Sltintgt object  implicitly instantiates Sltintgt      templateltgt     struct Sltintgt  illegal, explicit specialization after instantiation   NSltchargt p  0  name lookup finds NSltTgt int i  fp  name lookup finds Nf via ADL   NSltchargt object  illegal, incomplete type NSltchargt codepre  pIn both cases, the only way to make the program compile apart from deleting the specializations is to provide a definition for both specializations strongbeforestrong they are instantiated  which makes the forwarddeclaration a bit pointless.p  pDoes this behaviour have any practical realworld application Apart from this, is there anything these forwarddeclarations are useful forp

Ive no idea why the JS is not getting executed so hoping someone can spot the problem...p  pWhen I run my app on an iPhone 4S using XCode 4.6.3, everything works up until the StoreKit API asynchronously calls the codeproductsRequestcode success callback in codeInAppPurchase.mcode upon receiving the product data for the InApp Purchase items. I can see the output of the codeNSLogcode statement on line 213 which outputs the codecallbackArgscode in the XCode log window, which contains the correct details of the InApp Purchase items. The line after that should then result in the Javascript success callback being executed, which is defined on line 128 of codeInAppPurchase.jscode and passed in on line 140, but the log output at line 129 never appears in the XCode log window.p  pIf I step through the ObjectiveC using a breakpoint in XCode, I can see that the codecallbackIdcode variable has a sensible value and I can step through codeself.plugin.commandDelegatecode into the Cordova code to where the JS callback is constructed and this all seems fine but the JS never actually runs.p  pI also tried using Phonegap 2.7.0 with the app, but the result was the same.p  pMy XCode project for the app can be downloaded a hrefhttpge.tt1cnJOKov0 relnofollowfrom hereap  pstrongUpdate 19082013strong  The author of a hrefhttpfovea.ccblogindex.php3stepstutorialforphonegapinapppurchaseonios relnofollowa tutorial on how to use this plugina has a hrefhttpfovea.ccblogindex.php3stepstutorialforphonegapinapppurchaseonioscomment81 relnofollowconfirmed this problem with the plugin is reproduciblea but also has yet to find the causesolution.

The only way I have found to work around it is to add codeampnbspcode instead of spaces, but these tables are going to have a large amount of information in them and I would rather not have to change every space in the text if possible.p  pMy CSS isp  precodeltheadgt ltstyle typetextcssgt border    borderradius 8px    mozborderradius 8px   webkitborderradius 8px   border1px solid aaaaaa   display inlineblock    overflow hidden   padding0px    table.pretty     backgroundwhite   textalignleft    fontfamilyverdana, arial, sansserif   fontsize10pt   bordercollapse collapse  table.pretty td    border1px solid aaaaaa   color000000   padding5px   textalignleft  table.pretty th    border1px solid aaaaaa   padding5px   backgrounde2e2e2 repeatx   height34px    fontweightbold   textalign left   color3d5e0f  ltstylegt ltheadgt codepre  pMy body html isp  precodeltbodygt ltbordergtlttable classpretty stylewidth 90gt lttbodygt         lttrgt             ltth colspan2gtTitleltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd width25gtSubjectlttdgt             lttd width65gtDataltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd width25gtSubjectlttdgt             lttd width65gtDataampnbspgoesampnbspherelttdgt         lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegtltbordergt ltbr gtltbr gt ltbordergtlttable classpretty stylewidth 90gt lttbodygt         lttrgt             ltth colspan2gtTitleltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd width25gtSubjectlttdgt             lttd width65gtDataltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd width25gtSubjectlttdgt             lttd width65gtData goes herelttdgt         lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegtltbordergt ltbodygt codepre  pThere are two tables in the body text, just to give a sample.

Negative 1871 pI need to host multiple codeDjangocode sites quite a lot of sites actually and currently I am using codeApachecodecodemodwsgicode but I want to switch to codeuWSGIcode. p  pOne of the nice features of codeuWSGIcode is codecheaper modecode that spawns processes as needed and shuts them down as needed as well. On the other hand, it seems that the way to make it run multiple sites is to use codeemperor modecode. p  pCan codeemperor modecode be used together with codecheapercode subsystem Are there any quirksproblems I should be aware of Has anyone ever done thisp
Negative 1871 pI am having trouble with this code that wont execute code at a certain point. I cant really describe the problem in wording, but in the code, the remaining code under codewindow.mainloopcode will not run as I need it to unless the main window gui is closed which is problematic. I want to be able to codeprintt.testcode when all the code under def calculate has been completely executed. I technically could do it with removing codewindow.mainloopcode but this will run the code before I can gather input which is vital. I need to keep the structure of the coding the same as shown below as well.p  precodeimport tkinter  class Test    def initself     self.test  False  def calculatewindow, userinput, t   test  userinput.get   printtest   window.destroy   t.test  True  def main    t  Test   gui  tkinter.Tk   gui.titleexample window   gui.geometry400x400    userinput  tkinter.StringVar    window  tkinter.Toplevel   window.titleEntry   tkinter.Messagewindow, textLabel, width200.pack   tkinter.Entrywindow, width30, textvariableuserinput.pack   tkinter.Buttonwindow, textok, commandlambda calculatewindow, userinput, t.pack   window.mainloop    printt.test    gui.mainloop  main codepre  pstrongEDITstrong It seems I was able to make it behave the same way and keep the same structure by putting codeprintt.testcode under its own defined function and then calling it under codedef calculateuserinput, window, tcode in the last line.

Negative 1871 h2Backgroundh2  pI am developing an Android App which provides a simple HTTPHTTPS server. If the HTTPS serving is configured then on every connection an increasing native memory usage is observed which eventually leads to an app crash oom, while using the HTTP configuration keeps the native memory usage relative constant. The apps Java VM keeps relative constant in both configurations.p  pThe app serves an HTML page which contains a javascript with periodic polling one json poll every second, so calling the app page using the HTTPS configuration and keeping the page open for several hours will lead to the mentioned outofmemory because of increasing native memory usage. I have tested many SSLServerSocket and SSLContext configurations found on internet with no luck.p  pI observe the same problem on various Android devices and various Android versions beginning with 2.2 up to 4.3.p  pThe code for handling client requests is the same for both configurations HTTPHTTPS. The only difference between the two configurations is the setup of the server socket. While in the case of HTTP server socket one single line similar to this ServerSocket serversocket  new ServerSocketmyport does the job, in the case of HTTPS server setup the usual steps for setting up the SSLContext are taken  i.e. setting up the keymanager and initializing the SSLContext. For now, I use the default TrustManager.p  h2Need For Your Adviceh2  pDoes somebody know about any memory leak problems in Androids default TLS Provider using OpenSSL Is there something special I should consider to avoid the leak in the native memory Any hint is highly appreciated.p  pUpdate I have also tried both TLS providers OpenSSL and JSSE by explicitly giving the provider name in SSLContext.getInstance TLS, providerName . But that did not change anything.p  pHere is a code block which demonstrates the problem.

Negative 1871 pI would like to ask you about one technical aspect of creating GUI in Swing. Lets assume I have a codeJFramecode or codeJDialogcode never mind with content organized in many codeJPanelscode settings, actions, displaying data, charts etc...  all in one Frame. p  pFor example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13571142whatisagoodwaytoorganizemultiplejpanelsinajframehereap  pWhat Im doing now is to definie all components in one file let name it codeMainPanel.javacode and organizing them in codeJPanelscode. A have a separate methods for organizing each panel p  precodeprivate void organizePanels    pnlSettings  createPnlSettings   pnlActions  createPnlActions   pnlChart  createPnlChart    ...  codepre  pEach method is responsible for setting codeJPanelcodes layout, organizing components inside it etc. When I have 34 not complicated panels it makes sense I mean is quite readable. But if I create a more complicated structure it starts to be a small maintaining nightmare or a good starting point for being such. p  pThats why I want to use such approach   For each codeJPanelcode create a separate class  Each class should have a accessors to their inner components clicking a codeJButtoncode in codeJPanelcode A should effect in refreshing a JCombo in other codeJPanelcode. Comunication between Panels should be provided somehow by MainPanel.p  pSo, in mainPanel I will have only references to JPanels and not to components inside them. Accessing particular data will be a little bit longer codepnlActions.getSaveButton.setEnabledtruecode instead of codebtnSave.setEnabledtruecode  but its probably a natural consequnce. I can make also all components in JPanels public.p  pDo you find this approach correct Do you think that I should use the second approach all the time or maybe my first approach is suitable for not very complicated structures p  pWhat experience do you havep

Negative 1871 pI created an SKSpriteNode as the only node in my scene. It shows a small 120 x 75 pixels turtle dancing.p  pThe turtle has 100 dance frames. I can step through the frames in Finder and see perfect smooth motion.p  pNow I did ridiculous simple test in Sprite Kit. All frames on texture atlas. At app launch I generate SKTextureAtlas object, then preload all SKTexture objects into sequence array. On every frame I call next on the turtle node. It then simply grabs next SKTexture from the array and sets it as current texture.p  pThe animation is not smooth. iPhone 5S says 60 fps. But I see random frame drops happen.p  pI tried compression with PVR. Then I tried without atlas. Also tried calling the preload method of SKTextureAtlas. Still not smooth. It just wont display all texture frames with same frame duration for a smooth look.p  pThen I did even simpler test. A progress bar which moves one pixel at a time and 100 textures. Still not smooth. Nothing else is going on in my app and it is an iPhone 5S.p  pEven simpler testp  precodeSKAction a  [SKAction moveByX0 y300 duration30] [self runActiona] codepre  pFrom time to time you will notice a jump or hickup.

Negative 1871 pThere seems to be a problem with Dapper throwing an incorrect splitOn error message in certain situations.

C is also quite new for me, Ive used Visual Basic, but I just decided to learn XNA basics, because of the slow GDI.

Negative 1871 pI need to make spherical billboards i.e., setting depth, but taking into account perspective projectionideally including offcenter frusta.p  pI wasnt able to find any references to anyone succeeding at thisalthough there are plenty of explanations as to why standard billboards dont have perspective distortions.  Unfortunately, for my application, the lack isnt a cosmetic defect its actually important to the algorithm.p  pI did a bit of investigation on my ownp  blockquote   pThe math gets pretty messy rather quickly.  The obvious approaches dont work for example, you cant orient the billboard perpendicular to a viewing ray because tangential rays wouldnt intersect the billboard at right angles.p      pProbably the most promising approach I found was to render the billboard parallel to the near clipping plane, stretching it with a vertex shader into an ellipse.  This only handles perturbations along one axis so e.g. it wont handle spheres rendered in a corner of the view, but the main obstacle is calculating depth correctly you cant compute it as you would for an undistorted sphere because the sphere is occluding itself.p blockquote  pPoint of fact, I didnt find a good solution, and I couldnt find anyone who has.

Ive been researching rangebased iterators but Im a little confused as to how to construct my own, and because it is a vector of vectors the syntax does not match well with some online examples.p  pI would like guidance as to how I can go about creating this iterator. I know I need a begin and end function, as well as override the operator function to get it to work. Would my iterator use int values as the pointers that I increment in operator Would I need two pointers What would begin and end return, iterators, or integers, or T values, or vectors How should I construct the iterator and what data do I need for it Would the iterator constructor take two pointers as values, or one, or how would that work Would the iterator need its own copy of a VectorOfVectors to iterate and be set in a constructorp  pHow would I go about increasing the pointers Any help, general knowledge or even tips would be greatly appreciatedp  pHeres what Ive been fiddling around, just as a reference. p  precodeinclude ltvectorgt  using stdvector   templatelt typename T gt class VectorOfVectors  public      class iterator              public             Constructor             iteratorconst VectorOfVectorsltTgt  vov, int posvov, int posv                              posvov  posvov                 posv  posv                 vov  vov                           bool operator const iterator amp other const                              return pos  other.pos                           int operator  const              const iterator operator                               posv                 if posv  posvovgtend                                      posvov                     if posvov  vov.end                                              posvov                         posv  posvovgtend                         posv                         return this                                          else                                              posv  posvovgtbegin                         return this                                                       else                                      return this                                    private         int posv         int posvov         const VectorOfVectorsltTgt  vov           void AddEmptyVector              vectorOfVectors.pushbacknew vectorltTgt           int GetVectorCount const              return vectorOfVectors.size           vectorltTgt GetVectorAtIndexint index              return vectorOfVectors.atindex           void AddCopyOfVectorvectorltTgt amp toBeAdded              vectorOfVectors.pushbacktoBeAdded           iterator begin const              return iterthis, 0, 0           iterator end const              return iteratorthis, 4, 3       private     vectorlt vectorltTgt gt vectorOfVectors  new vectorlt vectorltTgt gt   codepre

Negative 1871 pemstrongFor the bounty, I am not interested in GPS or audio background modes as the former uses too much of the battery and the latter prevents any other audio from being used, otherwise facing audio interruption, thus ending background processes. I will need a way to be continuously processing in the background, so background modes that trigger occasionally are also out of the question.emstrongp  pemIf there is some way to run the application in the background, even by ignoring Apples rules, I am interested in trying it. If the answer is VOIP, I am unsure where to begin the implementation, as all of my research has come up too high level or as a failure. How will my application be able to run in the background using the VOIP background mode. Without any added code, the application refuses to run in the background.emp  hr  pI know that with iOS 7, background modes have changed again. I would like to be able to run my application that will never need to be approved on the iOS App Store in the background. I would also like to be able to stop execution in the background until a specific time in the future.p  pFor example, I would like it to run a process for 15 minutes, schedule the next task and then sleep until that time. For now, Ive had to run a silent track in the background for background processing, but I would like to be able to have the application truly sleep during that time  also, playing real music or making a phone call are handy features of the iPhone and I dont like losing them.p  pI know there is also GPS, but that consumes an enormous amount of battery. The other background modes dont seem to give full control of background processing and timing to the application and leave a large portion of the timing and execution duration to the OS.p  pWhat I need is to be able to have my application process in the background for minutes at a time and then sleep until a fairly specific interval and continue processing. Is this possible with a better approach than I am currently usingp  pIve seen that VOIP used to be a possibility, but Im not sure that it will work, as I dont need the application to run one simple task in the background, but rather to continue whatever was running in the foreground before the application was pushed to the background. Also, individual tasks could take upwards of 1 hour to complete, so they wont be able to transfer when the background task expires.

We use DI container to inject dependencies into controllers, services, and repositories i.e across the UIServicesDataAccess layers.p  pMy question is regarding DI in services. One thing I have been confused about recently has been arisen from the need to use the behaviour aka methods that was implemented in one service in another service.p  pAs far as I know, one service should not take dependency upon another because that would finally be leading closer to circular dependency and hence causing issues for DI container down the line.p  pSo my question is, how should I work this out p  pShould I be implementing the needed behaviour in second service as part of its own methods or I can somehow reuse it from the already implemented first service p  pCan DI container help me in this regardp  pOr is it that the way out is to outsource behaviour implemented in services into a separate Business Logic Layer, so it is available to each of the services BTW, we currently do not have a separate BLL.p

Negative 1871 pI am trying to populate a grid with information from a database table. I managed to achieve this using bruteforce and mysql, but would like to do it in a more elegant way now that I am upgrading the code to mysqli. This is my desired outputp  pre  col0row0 title      col1row0 title       col0row0 author     col1row0 author      col0row0 email      col1row0 email        col0row1 title      col1row1 title       col0row1 author     col1row1 author      col0row1 email      col1row1 email         and so on for subsequent rows pre  pI managed to do that in the past using extremely ugly code as shownp  precodeforx0xltnumberSidesx      for y0yltnumberRowsy                  queryString[x][y]  SELECT  from comments WHERE topicid  1 AND col  x AND row  y          col0Row0mysqlQuery  mysqlqueryqueryString[0][0] , commentingconn or diemysqlerror col0Row1mysqlQuery  mysqlqueryqueryString[0][1] , commentingconn or diemysqlerror col0Row2mysqlQuery  mysqlqueryqueryString[0][2] , commentingconn or diemysqlerror col1Row0mysqlQuery  mysqlqueryqueryString[1][0] , commentingconn or diemysqlerror col1Row1mysqlQuery  mysqlqueryqueryString[1][1] , commentingconn or diemysqlerror col1Row2mysqlQuery  mysqlqueryqueryString[1][2] , commentingconn or diemysqlerror   load those into output arrays col0Row0output  mysqlfetchassoccol0Row0mysqlQuery col0Row1output  mysqlfetchassoccol0Row1mysqlQuery col0Row2output  mysqlfetchassoccol0Row2mysqlQuery col1Row0output  mysqlfetchassoccol1Row0mysqlQuery col1Row1output  mysqlfetchassoccol1Row1mysqlQuery col1Row2output  mysqlfetchassoccol1Row2mysqlQuery codepre  pand then I would echo the col0row0output[title], col0row0output[author], etc for each field in the grid for my desired output. This is not the efficient way to code this, but Im a beginner so I did what I had to make it work for a demo.p  pEach comment in my table already contains a column and a row field, so I would like to actually translate that directly into the grid. To explain further each grid square could have more than one comment. so the records could look like thisp  pcodeTable fields title  author  email  row  col Record 0    TitleA    AuthorA  EmailA    0    0  Record 1    TitleB    AuthorB  EmailB    1    0  Record 2    TitleC    AuthorC  EmailC    0    1  Record 3    TitleD    AuthorA  EmailA    1    1  Record 4    TitleE    AuthorB  EmailB    0    0code p  pHence Record 0 and Record 4 are both in grid square 0,0.  Im now trying to move to a loop and a 3D array to make it work. I would like to be able to create the 3D array such that my echo command would be something like output[0][0][title] for the title field for col0row0, output[1][0][author] for the col1row0.p  pIm also moving away from mysql and replacing it with mysqli.PDO is a bit too advanced for me, but if people think that PDO has the best solution, I guess I can learn from your responses.p  pFor example, can I create a loop where the SQL result is stored as an array egp  precodeforx0xltnumberSidesx      for y0yltnumberRowsy                  queryString[x][y]  SELECT  from comments WHERE topicid  1 AND col  x AND row  y          sqlResult[x][y]  mysqliqueryconnection, queryString[x][y]         resultArray[x][y]  mysqlifetchassocsqlResult[x][y]        codepre  pWould that work Is there an elegant way to achieve what I am hoping to do I appreciate any guidance on this. Thanksp

Since the if statement opens all files in the directory, it errors out since this is not a regular Excel file. Is there a way to get it to skip the temp filesp  pHere is the code Im usingp  precodeSub selectrows  strPath  Cexceldocs  Set objExcel  CreateObjectExcel.Application objExcel.Visible  True objExcel.DisplayAlerts  False  Set objFso  CreateObjectScripting.FileSystemObject Set objFolder  objFso.GetFolderstrPath  For Each objFile In objFolder.Files  If objFso.GetExtensionNameobjFile.Path  xls Or objFso.GetExtensionNameobjFile.Path  xlsx Then  Set objWorkbook  objExcel.Workbooks.OpenobjFile.Path  Include your code to work with the Excel object here MsgBox objFile.Name  objWorkbook.Close True Commented out because this crashed the routine End If  Next  objExcel.Quit codepre
Negative 1871 pWe are using TFS as our code repo and JIRA as our ticketing system. I would love to use Crucible from Atlassian but they do not support TFS in this way. I know TFS in 2013 now has a code review process with it but we are not using their work items.p  pI wanted to know if anyone else is using this setup and how they are setting up their code reviews. I saw Jira has a Use TFS plugin but they do not give enough details on their features. Does anyone use this setup If so do you know if the syncing will support us using the TFS code review workflow and the ability to stuff the code into work items so we can switch tickets easy and keep the code with the ticket p  pIf not, do you know another plugin or another process that would achieve similar resultsp

Negative 1871 pI have the following setup a request comes in via a load balancer to a Websphere IHS server which forwards the request onto the application server also Websphere. The issue I am facing when SSO is enabled is that a new session is being created on every request. p  pI know this because I have written a snoop servlet and the session id is different on every request. The web server and the app server have been configured to work with cookies and the load balancer has sticky sessions enabled. p  pI am using spenego as it is websphere and kerberos config to validate user from Active Directory. p  pDoes anyone have any ideapointers as to why my session is created on every request only when SSO is enabled. Without SSO the session is the same for the different requests. I have tried a lot of different settings in websphere but none have worked. for example clustering at the server layer, enabling security checkbox in websphere session management etc..p  pI have also tried to create my own cookie and put this back into the response thinking it will come back in the request but as before no cookie is sent back. The JSessionID cookie is also not visible. Also when creating my own cookie as you can see in the logs it states that com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.srt.SRTServletResponse addCookie WARNING Cannot set header.

As far as I understood calling the then method will do the trick, is that rightp  pThanksp  pUPDATEp  pSo after reading the answers and further investigating into these promises stuff I came up with this, dont know if makes sensep  pNow the getPersons and getTalks dont populate the observable but just return the arrays, and the refresh function looks like thisp  precodefunction refresh      return .whendataservice.getPersonspersons, dataservice.getTalkstalks                 .then                         Success                         function personArgs, talksArgs                              personspersonArgs                             talkstalksArgs                         ,                         Failure                         function                             logger.logTheres been an error retrieving the data                            codepre  pTI still need that this refresh returns a promise, so still doubting about it.p

Negative 1871 pI want to change the frame size of a codeUICollectionViewcode in an animation that runs alongside an animated cell insertion to the same collection view inside a codeperformBatchUpdatescompletioncode block.p  pThis is the code that triggers the cell insertionp  precode[collectionView performBatchUpdates     indexPathOfAddedCell  ...     [collectionView insertItemsAtIndexPaths[ indexPathOfAddedCell ]]  completionnil] codepre  pBecause the cell insertion causes the collection views codecontentSizecode to change, I tried KVOregistering for changes to that property and then trigger the collection view frame update from the KVO handler.p  pThe problem with that approach is that the KVO trigger for codecontentSizecode fires too late the cell insertion animation has already completed at that time actually, KVO triggers right before the completion handler of codeperformBatchUpdatescompletioncode gets called but after the animation has played out in the UI.p  pIm not using auto layout.p  pemEditem I put a hrefhttpsgithub.comoleCollectionViewContentSizeAnimationa sample project to demonstrate my problema on GitHub.p  pemEdit 2em I should mention that I need this for a component Im writing a hrefhttpsgithub.comoleOLEContainerScrollViewcodeOLEContainerScrollViewcodea that is supposed to be 100 independent of the collection view. Because of this, I cannot subclass the collection view layout, nor do I have influence over the code that triggers the cell animations. Ideally, a solution would also work for codeUITableViewcode, which exhibits the same behavior.p
Negative 1871 pSo you can replace a property with a number, string, array, or object in JSON.stringify, like sop  precodevar myObj       allstar aFunction   function myReplacerkey, value      ifkey  allstar          return newFunction       JSON.stringifymyObj, myReplacer returns allstar newFunction codepre  pBut can you change it so that it instead returns codeallstar newFunctioncode without the quotes around codenewFunctioncodep

Negative 1871 pstrongHello there, StackOverflowstrongp  pI am in the process of writing a JavaScript edition of the popular game a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPentago relnofollowPentagoa as a side project before I have to return to classes in the fall.  I am, unfortunately, entirely stumped in regards to how to proceed from my current progress with this project.  p  pstrongMy Approachstrongp  pWhen I began writing this project, I assumed that the best approach for this game would be to instantiate four matrices and put them in a list.  Each matrix would represent one section of the Pentago board. I found that this approach caused me a great deal of headaches when considering my approach to how I would iterate over the matrices and determine whether or not a row of 5 game tokens had been placed.  p  pstrongReevaluation of my approachstrongp  pI then decided to get an outside perspective on how I could approach this problem to make it simpler to solve.  What was suggested was that I use one matrix instead of four.  This, however does seem to make rotating each section a bit more difficult, but not unreasonably so. p  pstrongMy question...strongp  pThis having all been said, what I really need to know is how I should approach determining if a player has won the game after having placed a token in a certain position.  p  pHere is what I emthinkem I knowp  ul lipThe function that will determine if the game is over will be executed after a player has rotated a quadrant. pli lipGiven this, I will know which player placed that last token.  I will only need to consider tokens placed by that player.pli lipI must iterate over the matrix from the position in the matrix that the last token was placed from, and determine if a token is adjacent to it.  Then, recursively perform this action on every adjacent token until I have found five adjacent tokens either diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.pli ul  pWhat follows is the code that I have already written for this game.  I would really appreciate any help that I can get on this part of the project... it has really stumped me Thanksp  pbr strongCode so farstrongp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comjakenewbypentagojstreemasterwwwapp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjakenewbypentagojstreemasterwwwappap  precodevar game  function players      var self       self.numTokensPlaced  0       instantiate the pentago board to all empty     self.board  []     forvar i0 ilt6 i              self.board[i]  []         forvar j0 jlt6 j                     self.board[i][j]  null                     rotate one of the four sections of the board      given a section and a direction     self.rotateSection  function section, direction            ifisGameOver                      else                ifdirection  clockwise                                 var newGrid  []             var rowLength  Math.sqrtsection.length             newGrid.length  section.length              for var i  0 i lt section.length i                              convert to xy                 var x  i  rowLength                 var y  Math.floori  rowLength                  find new xy                 var newX  rowLength  y  1                 var newY  x                  convert back to index                 var newPosition  newY  rowLength  newX                 newGrid[newPosition]  section[i]                           for var i  0 i lt newGrid.length i                              console.lognewGrid[i]                                            else                     rotate counter clockwise                  switchTurns                   place a token at a place on the board given      the player placing the token, the section, and the      location coordinates in that section that the token      is being placed.     self.placeToken  functionplayerid, location              if self.board[location[0]][location[1]]  null                      return location.toString   is already taken                  else                      self.board[location[0]][location[1]]  playerid             self.numTokensPlaced  self.numTokensPlaced  1             ifisGameOver                              alertgame is over                                  looks at the current player, and sets the current      player variable to the other player to switch turns.     function switchTurns            if players.current  players[0]                players.current  players[1]              else                players.current  players[0]              console.logplayers.current            look through the board to see if there are any      five tokens in a row belonging to one player.      returns bool     function isGameOverconsecutiveTokens             game cannot be over if the number        of tokens placed is less than 10         ifself.numTokensPlaced gt 10                      ifconsecutiveTokens lt 5                              fori0 i lt 3 i                                      ifself.board[i]  null                                              forj0 j lt 3 j                                                      ifself.board[i][j]  null                                                               ifself.board[i][j]  players.current                                                                                                                                                                                         else                              return true                                        else                      return false                    return self  codepre  pbr strongRules of the game.strong p  pPlace a marble in a quadrant.

Negative 1871 pThe MainActivity of my Android 4 app uses a codeViewPagercode to switch between 5 different Fragments. It is necessary, that both the Activity and the Fragments knows which Fragment is currently selecteddisplayed.

Of course I am aware of the possibility to save Date to the instance state. Thus getting back the information about the current index is not a big problem. The problem is, that the MainActivity cannot notify the selected Fragment because it has not reference to it. The Fragment is not created in the Adapter but automatically by the ViewPager. Thus the Activity does not get any information about the Fragment and has not possibility to notify it about being the active one...p

Negative 1871 pI have several Asterisk boxes and 2 kamailio  servers both for failover loadbalancing calls between Asterisk boxes. Kamailio server receives calls from E1 to SIP gateways, and then forwards the call to the Asterisk cluster. There is no NAT, and the platform only processes inbound calls.p  pAt this point, load balancing for Asterisk servers is OK Asterisk cluster handles several thousand simultaneous calls without any problem, and if i want to have more calls, i just need to setup a new Asterisk server and set its IP address to Kamailios dispatcher. Regarding Kamailio, the failover cluster if we can call it cluster, as there are only 2 serves works perfectly. p  pBut as any hightech solution, there are limits we cannot grow the Asterisk cluster indefinitely, so at some point, well need to add more Kamailio servers.

Negative 1871 pMy problem is, I have a Dimensional Model DB NFL league. So we have Players, Teams, Leagues as the dimension tables and Match as the factual table relates these tables. For instance, if I need to query stats of a player in a particular match or a range of matches, it is very painstaking SQL query with lots of joins to convert machine readable ID based tables to human readable name based version. In addition, analysis of that data is also very painful. For being a solution, I suggest to transform that DB to Analysis friendly version. Again for example, Player table ll include players at each row with related stats and same for Teams as well. p  pThe question is, is there any framework, method or schema that might guide me to design the analysis friendly DB layout. Also still the use of SQL is favorable or any nonsql DB is better for this problemp  pI know it sounds very general question but I just want to hear some expertise about the topic. Therefore, any help, suggestion is very welcome. p

Negative 1871 pIve built an game in Libgdx which uses a single FitViewport passedin to some Screens SplashIntroGameMenuPause etc..p  pEach Screen has its own Stage containing Groups of Actors  Ive written a custom render loop to allow Screens to fadeinout or slide around or render behind eachother  thats all great.p  pI now want a UI screen which will rotate on smartphones to match their orientation everything else in the game will NOT rotate. p  pI can make this work visually by using a TransformMatrix on the SpriteBatch but that doesnt affect the Stages touch detection or debugdraw and it seems there is no way to do this within the Stage localtoparentcoords allows for rotation and scale but NOT transformationp  pBear in mind that it will not be square the FitViewport enforces 16x9 ratio so it needs translation as well as rotation...p  pNote Ive tried to mess around with cameras but thats the wrong paradigm  cameras are a different view of the same thing  I want different things transformation and rotated drawn into the same viewp  pNote also Ive already started to create my own version of a ScreenStage class to do this  I think it might be quicker than kicking the existing code into working properly but Ill be surprised if Im the first person to want thisp

Negative 1871 pI would like to go for a suggestion on using  S3ClientCache class provided in AWS Java API.  The Transfermanager and AmazonS3Client are created for each region in this class and looks like we can use the Transfermanager present in this class for other uploads and downloads.AWS SDK uses this class as a part of S3Link uploads used in DynamoMapperp  pEven If I had to maintain my own transfermanager , it will be a copy of this class , and that loads more Transfermanager objects to memory. Why not simply use S3ClientCache provided in SDK  Or should leave this for DynamoDB operations and create a copy of this class p
Negative 1871 pI have a form where a user can specify hotelaccomodations for a biking event. The options are p  p1 stay the night before 50 europ  p2 have dinner the night before 20 europ  pHe also has the possibility to book a room at the hotel for up to 6 nonbikers.

Negative 1871 pThis might sound like some stupid question. I might write a MR code that can take input and output as HDFS locations and then I really dont need to worry about the parallel computing power of hadoopMR. Please correct me if I am wrong here.p  pHowever if my input is not an HDFS location say I am taking a MongoDB data as input  mongodblocalhost27017mongohadoop.messages and running my mappers and reducers and storing the data back to mongodb, how will HDFS come into picture. I mean how can I be sure that the 1 GB or any sized big file is first being distributed on HDFS and then parallel computing is being done on it Is it that this direct URI will not distribute the data and I need to take the BSON file instead, load it up on HDFS and then give the HDFS path as Input to MR or the framework is smart enough to do this by itselfp  pI am sorry if the above question is too stupid or not making any sense at all. I am really new to big data but very much excited to dive into this domain.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1871 pI am currently using fineuploader with ASP.NET webforms and am encountering a problem with strict mode in FireFox. ASP.NET webforms has a javascript file microsoftajaxwebforms.js that contains the following code This is used to postback to the server and call the passed event, ex. codeSavecode below.p  precodedoPostBack functiona, k      var f  window.event     if f          var d  arguments.callee  arguments.callee.caller  null         if d              var j  30             while d.arguments.callee.caller ampamp j d  d.arguments.callee.caller             f  j ampamp d.arguments.length  d.arguments[0]  null                   ... codepre  pThat function is used liberally in the codebase I am working with. I cannot change this code for fear of unintended sideeffects in the rest of the product. The problem is with the codearguments.callee.callercode. That is what is throwing the error codeaccess to strict mode caller function is censoredcode. I believe the solution is to remove the codeuse strictcode from the fineuploader.js, but I am worried about how that might effect fineuploader in other browsers. I am not familiar with strict mode in javascript, so maybe someone can shed some light on the possible sideeffects of removing strict mode from the fineuploader.js. For reference, here is the fineuploader function that eventually calls the above code and causes the error.p  precodevar fineUploader  jquerywrappedfineuploader.fineUploader     ...     multiple false,     text          uploadButton Click or drag a file to upload.     ,     autoUpload false,     debug false,     template fineuploadertemplate,     ...      .bindcomplete, function event, id, name, response      if response[success]          cphide         fineUploader.fineUploaderreset         doPostBackSave,       ... codepre  pI can modify anything short of the code referenced from codemicrosoftajaxwebforms.jscode if needed. I appreciate any help.p

Negative 1871 pI have some code which is loading an image into an OpenGL texture.  In the process, I end up loading 3 bitmaps, since I need to load the original bitmap sized appropriately for the display and reorient the bitmap based on EXIF data.  Im very quickly calling code.recyclecode on each bitmap, but Im noticing that my memory doesnt seem to change.p  pHeres what the Memory Monitor showsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQjUBb.png altmemory monitorp  pAs you can see, after loading the image Im using about 60MB of memory.  When I rotate the device that drops off a bit then comes back up.  That leads me to think there is no leak, since the memory never goes above that.p  pWhen I click the GC button in the memory analyzer, my memory footprint drops dramatically to around 8 MB.  This makes sense as the three bitmaps created during the process were recycled, so can be garbage collected.  Then you can see that when I rotate again and the activity is rebuilt, the memory jumps right back up.p  pHeres my code to show you why so many bitmaps are created and when theyre recycled.p  precodevoid layoutImage      ...         Bitmap bitmap  loadOrientedConstrainedBitmapWithBackouts...     imageTexture  new GLTexturebitmap     bitmap.recycle  recycle bitmap 2   Bitmap loadOrientedConstrainedBitmapWithBackoutsContext context, Uri uri, int maxSize      ...     Bitmap bitmap  loadBitmapWithBackoutscontext, uri, sampleSize  create bitmap 1     ...     Bitmap out  orientBitmapbitmap, orientation  create bitmap 2     bitmap.recycle  recycle bitmap 1     return out   Bitmap orientBitmapBitmap source, int orientation      ...     return Bitmap.createBitmapbitmap, 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth, bitmap.getHeight, matrix, true   create bitmap 3  codepre  pIm not really sure that this is a problem, so to speak, since the memory isnt climbing so no leak, but Im curious when it stays so high.  Since forcing a garbage collection clears it just fine, should I assume that if the system needs that memory it will be collected on the next GC pass  Its been running the whole time Ive been writing this and is still sitting comfortably at 60 MB.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong Can I just trust that the garbage collector will take that memory back if neededp  pAlso, if were supposed to be so judiciously recycling our bitmaps, why do so many of the Bitmap methods say things like The new bitmap may be the same object as source, or a copy may have been made.  Do I really have to check the equality every time I use those methods to recycle the bitmap if its a different objectp  pstrongQuestion 2strong When using Bitmap creation methods, that may or may not return the same bitmap or a copy, do I need to check source and output equality to recycle the source if its a copyp  h1Edith1  pI have tried analyzing this with MAT, using a heap dump at peak usage should be 60 MB, but it only reports 18.2 MB of usage and nothing unusual looking.  Could they be reading things differentlyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtbsMn.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1871 pI am generating a report in excel through Jasper report. It has a condition which isp  pThere are five columns in which first column is a image. There are two conditions one is that there may be a set item or a single item. A set item is made up of two or more single items. It can be any no. of Items. Now, the problem is that for a single item there is a single image and set item there is a single image.  So, In case of displaying a single item all the column values alongwith image is in a single row but for set,  first column that is one image per set to be displayed such that if there are five items that makes a set then we have 5 saperate rows showing each detail of item but only single image which is rowspan5 . p  pSo, I am confused how to do it because i have to dynamically show the image coming out of database based on items in set.  Further, I can get the no. of items in a set via SetCount but through saperate query. This count could not come from the same query which generates the result for output.p  pPlease guide me through the path. Thanksp

Negative 1871 pApologies if Im overlooking something obvious here. p  pstrongProblem Contextstrongp  pI have an application which allows the user to fill out a form, the contents of which will be uploaded to a database.

So, it would be a good idea to find a way to avoid setting this property until later or find a way around this. But Im not sure how to go about doing that. pli lipOne of my initial thoughts was that I could solve this fairly easily if only I could return a codebooleancode from each validating event handler however I suspected, and have since learned, that I cannot do that. I see an alternative to return values in event handlers is to pass in a mutable value such as, for example, codeCancelEventArgscode itself. This seems like it could perhaps be a suitable solution, however Im not sure how I can do this myself... pli ul

If I just type it in the controller text field i.e. package.control.someElementController or package.control.someElementController, it still wont pick up the FXML variables defined in the java controller.p  pIs this a bug in Scene Builder or am I approaching things the wrong way I have always have the controllers and the views in different folders, and since its a big project, Id like to keep things tidy.p

Negative 1871 pI was learning process management concept in operating system. Before that i came to know that processor can run one process at a time and to handle multiple processes we have process management.p  pAt the very basic level process is just instance of program code and process management program is also code. Hence process management is itself a process.p  pSo how come this process of process management program run along with other processes. p  pstrongNote  I am assuming that CPU can only run single process at a timestrongp

Negative 1871 pI have a problem doing something but its difficult to explain it.p  pI have a dynamic list of divs  3,5 or 10 for example. Every div should be next to the other on one line. Thats easy of course, but here is the problem. All divs are in a parent div with width 200px for example. All 5 child divs have width of 30, 100, 50, 200 and 40 pixels for example. So all divs cant be on one line, some of them should move on the next line or maybe on a third line. Thats also works at the moment. My problem is that I want divs on every line to be appended to the right of the parent div.p  pHere is an example p  precodeltdiv classparentgt     ltdiv classchildgtTestltdivgt     ltdiv classchildgtokltdivgt     ltdiv classchildgtVery very long textltdivgt     ltdiv classchildgtLong textltdivgt     ltdiv classchildgtadsdasltdiv ltdivgt  .parent      width 200px     overflow auto     backgroundcolor ccc  .child      float left     border 1px solid 000  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxy2goa3e relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netxy2goa3eap  pI want Test, ok and Very very long text to be appended to the right.

Negative 1871 pI thought this was easy but frankly its not.p  pGiven some lists like thesep  precode[15,3,15,3, 15, 40] [15,15,3,15,15,40] [6,3,5,17,19,15,13,15,6,3,5,3] codepre  pif the pattern from the first sequence is detected then the output list should increment each number position like thisp  precode[15,3,15,3, 15, 40] gt [0,0,1,2, 0,0] [15,15,3,15,15,40] gt [0,0,0,1,2,0] codepre  pBasically, there is an output list the size of input list. Each number is looked at and when a sequence is detected to be repeating the counter will increment once, starting at 0 and keep incrementing till the end of the pattern. If the sequence repeats again, the counter will increment further.p  pI have tried some code but its not solving this problem.p  pFor eg, [15,3, 15,3,15,40], it  stores the numbers not seen.  Since at index 2, 15 is repeated, it checks whether index[21]  index[01] if so increment to 1 and move to next number. Now index[31]  [11] and index [31] is the same as the first number of current number where condition was detected in this case index[2] is already covered. Hence, the last repeating number is 3 and increment is 2 thus giving [0,0,1,2,0,0]p  pI dont know whether to run a loop to check this and search for the sublist where the pattern is repeating till violation in a smaller loopp  pOne logic I thought of wasp  ol liIf number not in seen map, add to mapdictionary with index positionli liElse find the last position in array where it was first detected and compare the next position with the last position  i [i1..n until the first detected number is not repeated again OR the next number  the next number from the last next number]li liIncrement all detected number positions.li ol

Negative 1871 pSo ok it is well known that android does not guaranty a Crop intent such as codecom.android.camera.action.CROPcode. So I have been using a hrefhttpsgithub.combiokyscropimage relnofollowhttpsgithub.combiokyscropimagea. The problem with this library is that rotation does not work. When people try to rotate an image during cropping, either the whole screen or part of the screen goes blank. My users are reporting that the cropping is not working because they cannot see their image. Does anyone know how to fix this problem The user experience is quite terrible. Thanks for any advice.p

color resource and referencing it works... but due to the project structure I need it this way.p  pTo sum up strongI assume the reference to codeattrcolorAccentcode is somehow creating a cycle... but I cannot figure out why or how to fix it.strongp  pAny ideasp  hr  pstrongUpdate Why do I needwant to set codeaccentColorcode only in the themestrongp  pWe have a library that is common to many applications, that defines base themes from which the actual application theme must be derived. So the above example, which is simplified, is actually more akin to something like thisp  precodelt Styles that are inherited by applicationgenerated styles. gt ltstyle nameTheme.Library.Dark parentstyleTheme.AppCompatgt     ltitem namealertDialogThemegtstyleTheme.Library.Dark.AlertDialogltitemgt     lt more properties gt ltstylegt  ltstyle nameTheme.Library.Dark.AlertDialog parentstyleTheme.AppCompat.Dialog.Alertgt     ltitem namecolorAccentgtattrcolorAccentltitemgt     lt more properties gt ltstylegt codepre  pplus the corresponding variants for Light and Light with Dark Action Bar.p  pAfter this, the application project should only pick a base theme from the list provided, and then have something likep  precodelt Application theme gt ltstyle nameApplicationTheme parentTheme.Library.Darkgt     lt Ohter material colors gt     ltitem namecolorAccentgtFF9800ltitemgt ltstylegt codepre  pAt least this is the ideal situation, which worked before as Vikram points out in his answer, apparently only because there are two different codecolorAccentcode attributes.p  pThe advantage of this scheme is that I am not forced to provide default values for codecolorAccentcode in the library themes, as those are inherited from the AppCompat base ones.p  pAlso, should I need to create color resources, I would need two of them for light and dark variants since the default colors are not the same.p  pSo, ideally, Im looking for a similar solution provided one exists.p

Negative 1871 pIm trying to use the up navigation pattern and Im having issues while using both fragments and activities. Lets say that I have activity A and that activity contains fragment a. Now I click something in fragment a and a fragmentTransaction happens with fragment b replacing a and a is put in the back stack. The up arrow now appears in my toolbar. This is all fine. Now I click something in fragment b and fire up activity B. A is Bs parent. Now, B has an up arrow and I expect that when I touch it I would go to the top, i.e. finish activity B and the back stack of A would be popped so we end up with activity A containing fragment a and empty back stack.p  pMy issue here is that when up is pressed in B, B is finished but A is still showing fragment b. Is there any way that I can make A not restore its fragment back state onActivityResult or something like that so fragment b is never shown on up action from B p  pWhat I have tried is using startActivityForResult when firing up B and popping As fragment backstack onActivityResult but then b is briefly shown before the stack is popped. I just want A not to restore its fragment state if up was pressed in B.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6yaAd.png altIntended up behaviourp  pEdit The pattern Im using right now for the up navigation is that in my manifest I define A as Bs parent and in activity B I have a toolbar which I set as a supportActionBar with setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled.p

Negative 1871 pWithin my Flux architected React application I am retrieving data from a store, and would like to create an action to request that information if it does not exist. However I am running into an error where the dispatcher is already dispatching. p  pMy desired code is something likep  precodegetAll functionoptions    options  options     var key  JSON.stringifyoptions   var ratings  data.ratings[key]    if ratings      RatingActions.fetchAlloptions       return ratings  []  codepre  pHowever intermittently fails when the dispatcher is already dispatching an action, with the message codeInvariant Violation Dispatch.dispatch...

Negative 1871 pI have a programmaticallycreated binding to a DependencyProperty of some standard WPF control. I would like my function to be called when this binding is detached from the property.p  pIt is possible to attach a emvalue changeem notification to the property, but that means I need to recheck if the binding is still in place whenever the actual value updates, and if it does that a lot it may impact performance.p  pRelated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11889025notificationwhenthesourceofabindingexpressionchangesNotification when the Source of a BindingExpression changesap  p.p  pstrongBelow are details on what I am trying to accomplishstrongp  pIm writing a WPF Canvaslike control that has custom rules to place, size and rotate its children.p  precodeltmyMyCustomCanvasgt      ltButton myNamechild control 1 Canvas.Left10 Canvas.Top20gt      ltmySomeOtherControl myNamechild control 2 Canvas.Left70 Canvas.Top80gt  ltmyMyCustomCanvasgt codepre  pTo rotate child controls I need to set their RenderTransformProperty like thisp  precodeprotected override void OnVisualChildrenChangedDependencyObject visualAdded, DependencyObject visualRemoved      base.OnVisualChildrenChangedvisualAdded, visualRemoved     foreach UIElement child in InternalChildren              var group  new TransformGroup         var rt  new RotateTransform         var b  new Binding  Source  ..., Convertor  ...

Same happens if anyone or anything sets or resets child controls RenderTransform for any reason. The only way to recover is to close and reopen designer tab, which is annoying.p  pThe only thing I managed to do is to subscribe to a value changed event and reapply bindings if they are gonep  precode var dpd  DependencyPropertyDescriptor.FromPropertyRenderTransformProperty, typeofCustomCanvas  dpd.AddValueChangedchild, MyValueChangedHandler   static void MyValueChangedHandlerobject sender, EventArgs e           if   do checks to see if my bindings are still untouched               BindEverythingAgain   codepre  pThis works, but is emprobablyem not a great idea performancewise, considering I have up to 1000 controls onscreen, each updating around 60 times per second  and I have to request binding paths for all of them to properly check if they were not overwritten. p  pIsnt there eman event to listen when a property is unboundemp  pLooking through reference source I have found that when a dependency property data source is changed, Expression.OnDetach is a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comWindowsBaseBaseSystemWindowsDependencyObject.cs,76dfd12a4655a37a relnofollowcalleda. However, since both BindingExpression and MultiBindingExpression are sealed, I would need to subclass BindingExpressionBase which is way too much work.p  pI also found a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.data.bindingexpressionbase.status28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowBindingExpression.Statusa property is set when a binding is detached. Therefore, it should be possible to maintain a list of BindingExpressions and check that regularly, which should probably be much better performancewise. Is is not really a clean solution though as checking needs to run on a timer, and cannot be done in a value changed event since that would require to look up a bindingexpression in the list of known ones, which is not really a fast operation, even if such list is sorted.p

Negative 1871 pIn my app, Im currently using the standard codeUINavigationControllercode, and pushing several controllers onto the navigation stack. Now, I need the ability to show a custom codeUIViewcode or codeUIToolbar even underneath thecodeUINavigationBar and make it persist even after pushing a new view controller, and remove this view on demand. Very similar to the song info and controls in the iTunes Storep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPS6wg.jpg altenter image description herep  pRight now Im just adding this view to the top view controllers codeviewcode as a subview, so when a push is performed this custom view is no longer visible. Another problem is that this custom view overlaps the view controllers codeviewcode content.p  pIs there a way to implement a custom navigation bar, extend its height, and add a subview Then of course remove the subview and shrink the height when the view should no longer be shown Or add a view underneath the navigation bar, automatically updating the content insets everywhere to not lie underneath it Or how else could this be accomplishedp  pI looked into Apples sample code for custom navigation bars. They have an extended height example with a custom view, but they did this by adding the view to a single view controllers view, so pushing would not preserve it.p

Negative 1871 pUsing Backbone  Cordova, serving up via a Padrino webserver.p  pIn this app, you sign in via an OAuth server. However, when clicking on the link to sign in, the server receives the request and redirects the client to the OAuth server, opening this page in a browser session instead of the app itself. Upon signing in, the OAuth server redirects the client back to the frontend, but this time on the web version.p  pThis means that the app never actually knows that youre logged in.p  pI have tried messing with the codetargetcode attribute on the codeltagtcode link to no avail.

Negative 1871 pI want to store User Agent strings in a database.  Such strings are highly compressible, so I want to compress each User Agent string to a blob byte array and store the blob.  Id like a class that reads in a sample of strings, learns a compression model, and allows me to serialize export the model to disk for later reuse.  Then, given a User Agent string, I can compress it to a blob and store the blob. I cant use gzip or zip directly, because they only work well on larger files they have overhead for shorter strings.p  pIs there a Java library that exports serializes a compression model so it can later be imported and used to compress stringsp  pBTW, the db doesnt support compression.

Negative 1871 pMy application can work with different databases like SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL or SQLite. It knows how to load the relevant ADO.NET assembly its DLL file name is known and find the codeDbProviderFactorycode type in it. This factory gives me everything I need to work with the database connection on the plain ADO.NET level.p  pEntering Entity Framework. I used to use my own ORM but want to replace it with EF 6 Code First. My own ORM simply generated SQL and ran it with the codeDbCommandcode class. EF seems to do a lot more and require special configuration. I cant add assembly references to any supported database client provider and require deploying all those files. I need a solution that loads assemblies at runtime dynamically and finds its way from there. Then, depending on what database shall be used, I only deploy the DLLs required for that.p  pFor now that doesnt work yet.

I dont like that file altogether and would like to avoid using it completely.p  pIs there some API that I could use to register anything required for EF I have the type and an instance of the Npgsql provider, for example. Could I just pass that to some EF method so that it will use itp

Negative 1871 pIm playing with the codeakkastreamandhttpexperimentalcode 1.0. So far, Ive a user service that can accept and respond to HTTP requests. Im also going to have an appointment service that can manage appointments. In order to make appointments, one must be an existing user. Appointment service will check with the user service if the user exists. Now this obviously can be done over HTTP but Id rather have the appointment service send a message to the user service. Being new to this, Im  not clear how to use actors as codeakkahttpcode abstracts that to send and receive messages. Theres mention of codeActorRefcode and codeActorPublishercode in the a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkastreamandhttpexperimental1.0scalastreamintegrations.html relnofollowdoca but no examples of the former and the later looks like an overkill for my need.

Negative 1871 pIm developing some multiuser application. In this application multiple users can access and edit data. For the frontand webapp I use AngularJS.p  pI am facing some architectural problem.p  pLets say, there is some data1. This data1 should be accessible for many users view only, but only one user should have the possibility to edit this data1.p  pIf the data1 is marked as inEdit, the other users can only view the last saved version of the data1.p  pNow, I am not quite sure, how to implement this feature.p  pAs for me, there are two ways of doing that.p  pstrongFIRSTstrong Save the object state in the DBp  pstrongSECONDstrong Save the object state in a global servicep  pMy problem is, I dont know, which way is the better one.p  pIf I choose the strongFIRSTstrong approach, I will have following approximate events orderp  ol lipUser gets the list with data loaded from the DB. 1 requestpli lipWhen double clicking on some data set, there will be a request to DB, which will provide data of the data set and its state inEdit or nothing. 1 requestpli lipWhen the user chooses edit on the data set  request to the DB to check if the object is still not in the inEdit state. If it is so  save new state of the object set inEdit and then allow the user to edit the object. If the object is in edit state  notify the user. 1 requestpli lipUser edited data and then clicks save  request to the DB  save new data, and reset objects inEdit state. 1 requestpli ol  p4 DB requestsp  pThe strongSECONDstrong approach has the following orderp  ol lipDB request to get the list of items. 1 requestpli lipDouble click  open data set  request object details from the DB and check for entries in the global service. 1 requestpli lipClicking edit   check for the state in the global service.pli lipWrite the object type and id in the global service if opened for edit.pli lipSaving edits  write edits in the DB and delete the service entry 1 requestpli ol  p3 requests  servicep  pI thing the idea with the service, isnt that good, because if You consider there will be a lot of objects opened and there will be a lot of such objects when the application grows, the service will have to store all the states. And that isnt good for the servers RAM, which will also have to store other data.p  pSo, what would You recommendp  pP.S. If there are some good implementations of my problem feel free to let me know about them.p
