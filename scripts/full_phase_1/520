Positive 520 pI am running a streaming job and want to build a lookup map incrementally track unique items, filter duplicated incomings for example, initially I was thinking to keep one Dataframe in cache, and union it with new Dataframe created in each batch, something like this p  pitems.foreachRDDrdd RDD[String]         ...br         val uf   rdd.toDF          cacheddf  cacheddf.unionAlluf          cacheddf.cache          cacheddf.count    materialize the  ...       p  pMy concern is that the cacheddf seems remember all the lineages to previous RDDs appended from every batch iteration, in my case, if I dont care to recompute this cached RDD if it crashes, is that an overhead to maintain the growing DAG p  pAs an alternative, at the beginning of each batch, I load the lookup from parquet file, instead of keeping it in memory, then at the end of each batch I append the new RDD to the same parquet file  noDuplicatedDF.write.modeSaveMode.Append.parquetlookup. This works as expected, but is there straight forward way that keep the lookup in memory p  pThanks  Wanchun p

Positive 520 pIm using codelibcurlcode in C to send requests to an HTTP service. I want to stream my codePOSTcode requests. Im observing things in Wireshark.

Positive 520 pI have a WCF service which exposes two endpoints one TCP and another REST. I have a method in WCF which return a Stream of file. From my client application, I use Async calls to start download the file  and save it as a local file. After the completion of the thread I need to return to the main thread so that I can update the UI. For this I use Dispatcher.Invoke. p  pThe problem is that the rest endpoint seems to download and save the file, but TCP endpoint throws me time out error. Another issue I have is in both endpoints when the code completes and return to line Dispatcher.Invoke it just hangs and does not proceed.p  pI have debugged it and the service call is working on a worker thread as expected but somehow the whole application hangs when I try to use the Dispatcher.Invoke to come back to main threadUI. I have also tried Dispatcher.BeginInvoke but the same result.p  pThe same application and code works fine when I call any other WCF method which return me JSON or data contract. In that case I am able to move back to main thread using Dispatcher.Invoke. But some how when I am calling the WCF method to download a file it just hangs.p  pI have tried to list down the code below. Not sure what I am doing wrong here. My webConfig is set to max sizes. I am not expecting huge files though typically between 25 MB. p  pCan you please let me know what I am doing wrong here  I expect the download and write to file complete and then move to main thread. I would want it to be streaming so that even in future the file size increases, I can handle that as well. p  pAny pointerssuggestion would help.p  ul liGirijali ul    precodepublic static class Holder      public static Dispatcher CurrentDispatcher  get set   Set when application loads   public class Downloader        public Downloader                 public void DownloadFileAndActstring fileName              AsyncCallback callback  new AsyncCallbackthis.DownloadComplete         Funcltstring, stringgt del  new Funcltstring, stringgtthis.DownloadStream         del.BeginInvokefileName, callback, this           private void DownloadCompleteIAsyncResult ar              AsyncResult res  AsyncResultar         Funcltstring, stringgt objCaller  Funcltstring, stringgtres.AsyncDelegate         var filePath  objCaller.EndInvokear           The below code is where it just hangs         Holder.CurrentDispatcher.Invokenew Action gt                       Do some stuff on main thread like display the file in a selction list                     private string DownloadStreamstring fileName              TestServiceClient client  new TestServiceClient          1st approach         var stream  client.DownloadFilefileName         client.Close          var savePath  DMySavedLocation  fileName          using var file  File.CreatesavePath                      stream.CopyTofile                    2nd approach tried this too         const int bufferSize  2048         byte[] buffer  new byte[bufferSize]         using FileStream outputStream  new FileStreamsavePath,             FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write                      int bytesRead  client.DownloadFilefileName.Readbuffer, 0, bufferSize             while bytesRead gt 0                              outputStream.Writebuffer, 0, bytesRead                 bytesRead  client.DownloadFilefileName.Readbuffer, 0, bufferSize                          outputStream.Close                  client.Close           return savePath       codepre

Positive 520 hr  pIm curious about whether I can save users bandwidth for mobile video streaming the monthly cellular plan data can quickly dissapear with just a few videos streamed  Ive used gzip to send small files such as html, css, and javascript faster, and Im wondering if its a common practice or even makes sense to send individual packets in compressed form. Sort of gzip for a video stream. p  pIs this done Why or why not I use video streaming as an example, but Im actually curious about streaming data for immediate usage meaning decompression must happen constantly in general. p  pIm not sure that compression is effective on the packet level and Im also not sure decompression during realtime playing would work out, thats really what Id like explained.p

I need to do this ema lotem.p  pThe problem is that while Java doubles have no problem with a number likep  precode0.0000000000000000000000000000000001 1.0E34 codepre  pthey cant represent something likep  precode1.0000000000000000000000000000000001 codepre  pConsequently of this I lose precision rapidly the limit seems to be around 1.000000000000001 for Javas doubles.p  pIve considered just storing the numbers with 1 subtracted, so for example 1.0001 would be stored as 0.0001  but the problem is that to multiply them together again I have to add 1 and at this point I lose precision.p  pTo address this I could use BigDecimals to perform the calculation convert to BigDecimal, add 1.0, then multiply, and then convert back to doubles afterwards, but I have serious concerns about the performance implications of this.p  pCan anyone see a way to do this that avoids using BigDecimalp  pstrongEdit for claritystrong This is for a largescale collaborative filter, which employs a gradient descent optimization algorithm.  Accuracy is an issue because often the collaborative filter is dealing with very small numbers such as the probability of a person clicking on an ad for a product, which may be 1 in 1000, or 1 in 10000.p  pSpeed is an issue because the collaborative filter must be trained on tens of millions of data points, if not more.p

Negative 520 pMy team is in the process of designing a domain model which will hide various different data sources behind a unified repository abstraction. One of the main drivers for this approach is the very high probability that these data sources will undergo significant change in the near future and we dont want to be rewriting business logic when this happens. One data source will be our membership database which was originally implemented using the default ASP.Net Membership Provider. The membership provider is tied to the System.Web.Security namespace but we have a design guideline requiring that our domain model layer is not dependent upon System.Web or any other implementationenvironment dependency as it will be consumed in different environments  nor do we want our websites directly communicating with databases.p  pI am considering what would be a good approach to reconciling the MembershipProvider approach with our abstracted ntier architecture. My initial feeling is that we could create a DomainMembershipProvider which interacts with the domain model and then implement objects in the model which deal with the repository and handle validationbusiness logic. The repository would then implement data access using our asyet undecided ORMdata access tool.p  pAre there are any glaring holes in this approach  I havent worked closely with the MembershipProvider class so may well be missing something. Alternatively, is there an approach that you think will better serve the requirements I described abovep  pThanks in advance for your thoughts and advice.p  pRegards, Zacp

Negative 520 pAn update panel, a postback and jQuery. Sounds like a bad joke, but heres my situation.p  pIve got two grids wrapped up in a MS update panel. The grids each have buttons in them that cause postback events to happen. under one grid is a div which is hidden by a jQuery function. And in one grid is a hyperlink which can cause that hidden div to show. Inside of the  hidden div is a aspbutton used for another postback.p  pNow is when I run into a problem. When I click either one of the  buttons inside the grids, my div which is hidden by jQuery shows  up. I dont want it to show up. In fact it should stay hidden until I call the method to make it show up. The hyperlink click event for the div does work, its just that on a postback, the hidden div  shows. Anyone know what could be causing this Am I missing something on the postback or do I need more in the document.ready section of the jquery. Or is the MS ajax update panel screwing with things.p  pHeres a snippet of the jQuery to hide the divp  precodedocument.readyfunction     actionDiv.hide                   codepre

Negative 520 pMS Query, when connecting to SQL Server through an ODBC Data Source, uses the system procedure sptables to retrieve a listing of tables in the database.  The source for sptables can be viewed but not altered.  The problem with this procedure is that it will not return a table name for which the connected user has permissions to access only certain columns.  It only returns tables for which the connected user has full SELECT access.p  pWe are using database roles with explicitly granted access to tables in our data warehouse.  We have a model for building security down to the field level, but cannot enable it due to the problem above.  Most users are accessing through MS Query and Excel, because everyone has MS Office and we have trained them in its use.p  pSince many reports have already been built around this product, migrating users to another product is not an option at this time.p  pOne suggestion has been to create views with only the available columns and grant select on those views.  This would work, but 1 would defeat the purpose of fieldlevel access and isnt too far off of our current workaround and 2 would require retraining the users on using the new views instead of the tables they are used to.p

Negative 520 pI am working on an app that uses 2D textures to create animated kaleidoscopes. It starts out displaying to an NSOpenGLView. I am adding an option to switch to fullscreen mode.p  pI would prefer to use the OS 10.5 approach to full screen so I can support 10.5, but I think I would face the same issue if I was using the approach described in the docs under Creating a FullScreen Application in Mac OS X v10.6.p  pThe NSOpenGLContext init method initWithFormatshareContext takes an optional pointer to Another OpenGL graphics context whose texture namespace and display lists you want to share with the receiver.p  pThe code Im using to create the full screen OpenGL context is straightforwardp  precodeNSOpenGLPixelFormatAttribute myAttributes[]                 Pixel Format Attributes for the FullScreen NSOpenGLContext      NSOpenGLPFAFullScreen,                                   specify fullscreen OpenGL context     NSOpenGLPFAScreenMask,     CGDisplayIDToOpenGLDisplayMaskkCGDirectMainDisplay,    specify main display     NSOpenGLPFAColorSize, NSOpenGLPixelFormatAttribute 32,     NSOpenGLPFADepthSize, NSOpenGLPixelFormatAttribute 0,     NSOpenGLPFAStencilSize, 0,     NSOpenGLPFADoubleBuffer,     NSOpenGLPFAAccelerated,     0   NSOpenGLPixelFormat myPixelFormat  [[NSOpenGLPixelFormat alloc] initWithAttributesmyAttributes]   Create FullScreen NSOpenGLContext with these attributes   NSOpenGLContext fullScreenContext  [[NSOpenGLContext alloc] initWithFormatmyPixelFormat shareContext myContext]  Create an NSOpenGLContext with the FullScreen pixel format. codepre  pHowever, it doesnt seem to work.p  pMy app only uses one texture, so I started out not using glGenTextures and glBindTexture. Instead I just used the single current texture for the context.p  pI tried changing my code to create a named texture with glGenTextures, in the hopes that I could bind the named texture after switching to the fullscreen context, but no dice. Both approaches give the same result  the texture does not work in the full screen context.p  pI dont get any errors, but drawing with a texture doesnt do anything.p  pI am forced to recreate my texture each time I switch to fullscreen mode. This is bad because the textures are potentially very large depending on how big an image the user loads, up to the max texture size. That forces me to load two copies of a very large object into VRAM. Worse, I have to do byteswizzling in some cases to get the byte order correct. That takes several seconds on a large texture, which makes for a pregnant pause when entering fullscreen mode.p  pIs there some trick Im missing to sharing textures between an NSOpenGLView and a full screen OpenGL contextp

Negative 520 pThis is a bit of a further down the track now extension to a question I asked a while ago... I have a better understanding of sockets now, and have some working code but need to improve it...p  pOk, so I have currently got UDP multicasting working to send short strings of text from a Java server application to several Android phones which will potentially become several hundred Android phones.  This works fine most of the time, but it does tend to lose the odd string on the odd phone, and randomly it will just go total loss for a short period and nothing will get through to any of them, which can be a little frustrating.p  pSince, as I understand, there is no way to broadcast on TCP  my idea is to have the phones initially connect to the server app using a strongServerSocketstrong.  This will do nothing more than harvest client IP addresses which are to be stored in a codeSetltInetAddressgtcode called strongclientsstrong.  Then I will want to iterate over these addresses and send the string to each phone individually  strongbutstrong I dont want to block the code, nor do I want to spend forever waiting for sends to occur if, say, the phone has gone to sleep and cant  wont accept connections.  The information will need to get to all phones within a few seconds of starting to send even with 2300 clients.p  pMy initial code is below, and the questions I have regarding it arep  ul liIs this code in one thread enoughli liWould a modern CPU make good use of several threads with the address set split evenly amongst them say 4 threadsli liIs it as I believe a bad idea to spin every connectionsend off in its own threadli liDoes setting the socket timeout allow the thread to work through its list faster Or will this cause problems  li liIf socket timeout setting is a good idea, then what is a sensible time  Or do I need to just test to get this rightli ul  pThanks in advance for any help you guys can provide...p  precodefor InetAddress client  clients  try      Socket sendQuestionSocket  new Socketclient, portSend      Theory 50 milliseconds is enough to connect, and could allow 200 clients       to get their questions in around 10 seconds.

Negative 520 pLet me just say up front that what Im aware that what Im about to propose is a mortal sin, and that I will probably burn in Programming Hell for even considering it.p  pThat said, Im still interested in knowing if theres any reason why this wouldnt work.p  pThe situation is  I have a referencecounting smartpointer class that I use everywhere.  It currently looks something like this note incompletesimplified psuedocodep  precodeclass IRefCountable  public     IRefCountable  refCount0      virtual IRefCountable       void Ref refCount     bool Unref return refCount0  private     unsigned int refCount   class Ref  public    RefIRefCountable  ptr, bool isObjectOnHeap  ptrptr, isObjectOnHeapisObjectOnHeap             ptrgtRef         Ref            if ptrgtUnrefampampisObjectOnHeap delete ptr      private    IRefCountable  ptr    bool isObjectOnHeap  codepre  pToday I noticed that sizeofRef16.  However, if I remove the boolean member variable isObjectOnHeap, sizeofRef is reduced to 8.  That means that for every Ref in my program, there are 7.875 wasted bytes of RAM... and there are many, many Refs in my program.p  pWell, that seems like a waste of some RAM.  But I really need that extra bit of information okay, humor me and assume for the sake of the discussion that I really do.  And I notice that since IRefCountable is a nonPOD class, it will presumably always be allocated on a wordaligned memory address.  Therefore, the least significant bit of ptr should always be zero.p  pWhich makes me wonder... is there any reason why I cant OR my one bit of boolean data into the leastsignificant bit of the pointer, and thus reduce sizeofRef by half without sacrificing any functionality  Id have to be careful to AND out that bit before dereferencing the pointer, of course, which would make pointer dereferences less efficient, but that might be made up for by the fact that the Refs are now smaller, and thus more of them can fit into the processors cache at once, and so on.p  pIs this a reasonable thing to do  Or am I setting myself up for a world of hurt  And if the latter, how exactly would that hurt be visited upon me  Note that this is code that needs to run correctly in all reasonably modern desktop environments, but it doesnt need to run in embedded machines or supercomputers or anything exotic like thatp
Negative 520 pI have an codeImageViewcode which is displaying a png that has a bigger aspect ratio than that of the device vertically speaking  meaning its longer.

Negative 520 pIm using an external library in Android that has an ArrayList of objects that is accessed from another thread. My problem is that Id like to move some objects from this AarrayList in a way that does not cause null exception on the other thread.p  pSo, what I want to do is I have an ArrayList ABCDEFGH, and I want to move F from its actual position to the first position, so the ArrayList will become FABCDEGH. Note that I cant use swap for that because every other object is shifted right.p  pA naive implementation isp  precodelist.removeF list.add0,F codepre  pBut this implementation cause null exception on the other thread because the other thread is looping the list by handwritten counted loop, so because of the race condition the thread loop can run between the removal and addition of F. I cant make the ArrayList tread safe because I do not have access to the external library.p  pIs there a better way to make this movement from any position to any position of the Arraylist without the race condition Note that the size of the ArrayList will not be modified.p

To guarantee the stronguniquenessstrong of ids they are given by an codeenumcode witch need to be in a central and accessible place so that anybody can add an codeidcode before creating a new codeEventcode type ... You get it.p  pI once tried to reduce the relative emcomplexityem of this system to allow users programmers to create new codeEventcode in a simpler way without losing the safety of the emuniquenessem. p  pSo I decided to go with something like thisp  pEventBase.hp  precodeclass EventBase  public     virtual int getId const  0     static int registerEvent  return numberOfEvent private     static int numberOfEvent  codepre  pEventBase.cppp  precodeint EventBasenumberOfChild  0 codepre  pEvent.hp  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class Event  public EventBase  public     virtual int getId const  return id     static const int id   templateltclass Tgt const int EventltTgtid  EventBaseregisterEvent codepre  pEvent1.hp  precodeclass Event1  public EventltEvent1gt  codepre  pEvent2.hp  precodeclass Event2  public EventltEvent2gt  codepre  pSo basically any new codeEventcode type have its own static const id depending of the number of codeEventcode type defined, so far so good we dont have to mess with the codeenumcode ...

Negative 520 pSay I have a large array of M 32 bit ints in which each value has no more than N bits set. Now I want to return the subset which matches the query Target AND Value  Target, i.e. values in which the targets bits appear set in the arrays values.p  pBrute force is easy, simply iterator the array and extract where targetampvalue  target. This becomes way too slow if M gets very large. Anyone have an idea of how to convert the array into a data structure that is more optimal to searchp  pOne way is to store arrays or value for each bit thus for 32 bit array you need 32 of these and then only search the values that match each bit in the target value. This helps a little unless N gets close to 32 or the target has close to N bits set. Since what I am looking for is essentially a partial match, hashing or sorting doesnt appear to help.p  pExact correct results are a requirement. This will have to work without access to parallel hardware like a GPU or using SIMD.p  pI will be using C but just some pointers to algorithms or ideas is fine. The most likely case would be M100000 and N8 and be called frequently.p  pJust to reiterate I need a partial match like item  011000 matching target  001000 not an exact match. Although the M items is known ahead of time, the possible values of targets can be anything.p  pstrongI finally decided to stick with brute force. For 80,000 items its not worth doing anything else. I imagine if the size of the dataset were more like 800,000,000 it might be worth it.strongp

Negative 520 pIm developing an HTML email and Ive done my best to adhere to best practices for HTML email designs. p  pIm doing some test sends to two coworkers who both have iPhones and the same email message is appearing quite differently on both. Theres all kinds of sizing issues on one, resulting in a broken layout. p  pTheyre both using the iOS mail app, both have iPhone 4. I looked at their software versions, and since one is ATT and one is Verizon, the version numbers and models are slightly different, so maybe its just a different version of the mail app that is causing this. Apart from that, everything else is identical. Ive checked both of their settings and anything related to rendering the screen is the same mail settings all the same, accessibility settings the same. p  pAt this point, Im not so much interested in making it work on both devices, Id just like to know why one iPhone would break the layout and the other one wont. The device with the broken layout belongs to the founder of the company, so it would be nice to at least fix the problem for him he says that TechCrunchs emails do the same thing, so I know it must be something on his phone. p  pAny tips or advice is appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 520 pThis is just something thats been puzzling me ever since I read about iterators on Jon Skeets a hrefhttpcsharpindepth.comarticleschapter6iteratorblockimplementation.aspx relnofollowsitea.p  pTheres a simple performance optimisation that Microsoft has implemented with their automatic iterators  the returned IEnumerable can be reused as an IEnumerator, saving an object creation. Now because an IEnumerator necessarily needs to track state, this is only valid the first time its iterated.p  pWhat I cannot understand is why the design team took the approach they did to ensure thread safety.p  pNormally when Im in a similar position Id use what I consider to be a simple Interlocked.CompareExchange  to ensure that only one thread manages to change the state from available to in process.p  pConceptually its very simple, a single atomic operation, no extra fields are required etc.p  pBut the design teams approach Every IEnumerable keeps a field of the managed thread ID of the creating thread, and then that thread ID is checked on calling GetEnumerator against this field, and only if its the same thread, and its the first time its called, can the IEnumerable return itself as the IEnumerator. It seems harder to reason about, imo.p  pIm just wondering why this approach was taken. Are Interlocked operations far slower than two calls to System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, so much so that it justifies the extra fieldp  pOr is there some other reason behind this, perhaps involving memory models or ARM devices or something Im not seeing Maybe the spec imparts specific requirements on the implementation of IEnumerable Just genuinely puzzled.p

Negative 520 pIm building a data entry form for order processing and could use some best practice advice.

In my situation , an order consists of  a header area, with merchant and customer shipping information  a detail area with line items displayed on it as the user adds them from a menup  pI have four order types that will use this same layout but the business logic behind them all will be different.p  pSo my question is this.p  pWhat would be the best way, in someones opinion to accomplish this without duplicating the page layouts four times and still keeping the differing business logic separate  p  pIve considered making the control areas into user controls, then creating an order page for each type of order I need, and writing business logic for each page.

Negative 520 pIve just implemented Facebook connectoauth in my web app and finally got it working.  We also have two mobile apps iOS and Android, both of which are not native apps, but rather shell browsers they effectively just display the mobile version of our site in a nice package.p  pOur Facebook connect implementation isnt working on mobile as is, but Im not sure why  the asynchronous js to initialize the SDK, grab the cookie, etc., is on our mobile pages just like the full versions.  Is there something about the shell browser that prevents this from working e.g. the cookie from getting storedp  pIs there an easy workaround for this, or do we have to flesh out the app a bit and implement the iOSAndroid SDKs and single signonp  pEdit a bit more detail about whats happening p  pWe go to the app, click login with Facebook.  Via the js sdk, were taken to Facebooks little authorize window emin the mobile browserem not within the app, as all external links are set to open outside the app.  Everythings ok with the authorize window, but when we click through to authorize the app and log in, were taken to a blank page in the mobile browser.  That is, we dont go back to the app and call the redirect that is set to get triggered upon authorizationlogin.p  pI suppose there could be two solutions to this  should we make it so that these facebook dialogueslinks open emwithinem the app so we never leave and go to the mobile browser Or is there a way to have the mobile browser redirect us back to the app that originally called it so that when the fb dialogue opens in the mobile browser, we accept and are taken back to the appp

Negative 520 pIm trying to removereduce wasteful queries in my application to improve the speed. One query I have checks to see whether a table exists.

The query above is used to check whether the user has entered the database information for the 3rd party system correctly. First the system connects to the database and if that works, tries to query a table using the user specified table prefixp

Negative 520 pIm using Flex 4.5 and trying to take advantage of the new state groups feature.  I have two codeStatecodes call them readType1 and readType2 that both belong to the same codestateGroupcode call it readOnly.  There are several places where Id like to do something based on the current state, and it would be the same thing for the two read states.  E.g.p  precodeif this.currentState  readType1  this.currentState  readType2    do stuff  codepre  pWhat Im wondering is if theres a way to change this so that its based on the codestateGroupcode because logically thats really what its based on, not on the actual exact states in an easy way.  I would like to do something likep  precodeif this.currentStateGroup  readOnly    do stuff  codepre  por failing thatp  precodeif this.currentStateObject.stateGroups.indexOfreadOnly gt 0    do stuff  codepre  pI havent been able to find a way to get the name of the current codestateGroupcode, nor to get ahold of the actual codeStatecode object for the current state codecurrentStatecode is just a String without looping through codethis.statescode.  Im hoping Im missing something and theres a way to get this easily...p  pI thought this was the sort of thing state groups were supposed to help with grouping common behaviors together.  Or am I misunderstanding the point of state groups  There arent many examples or much info available on them, and the examples I have found havent been good enough to really understand how one would use them in a real app.p  pAnyhow if anyone knows of a way to do what I want Id appreciate it, or if Im thinking about this all wrong, please let me know.

Negative 520 pI am working with a node.js project using a hrefhttpsgithub.comedsuwikistream relnofollowWikistreama as a basis, so not totally my own code which streams realtime wikipedia edits. The code breaks each edit down into its component parts and stores it as an object See the gist at a hrefhttpsgist.github.com2770152 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com2770152a. One of the parts is a URL. I am wondering if it is possible, when parsing each edit, to scrape the URL for each edit that shows the differences between the preedited and post edited wikipedia page, grab the difference inside a span class called diffchange diffchangeinline, for example and add that as another property of the object. Right not it could just be a string, does not have to be fully structured.p  pIve tried using a hrefhttpnode.io relnofollownodeioa and have some code like this i am specifically trying to only scrape edits that have been marked in the comments m[6] as possible vandalismp  precode    if m[6].matchvandal ampamp namespace  article     nodeio.scrapefunction         this.getHtmlm[3], functionerr,              console.loggetting HTML, boss.             console.logerr             var output  []             span.diffchange.diffchangeinline.eachfunctionscraped                 output.pushscraped.text                          vandalContent  output.toString                            else          vandalContent  no content      codepre  pWhen it hits the conditional statement it scrapes one time and then the program closes out.

Negative 520 pI am new to Android application development and am trying to find a way to proceed through a series of screens that take in user input.  Im making a small math game where the user would answer basic two integer addition problems. So far the main menu is created.  It has a New Game button which launches my GameActivity and it runs just fine for one math problem.  However, after the user inputs their answer to the simple math problem, I would like to be able to continue on to another math problem once the user had answered the current problem and the method would return a correctincorrect value. Initially I thought of doing something like a basic FOR loop from within the GameActivity p  precode  forint i  0 i lt 10 i gameMethod  codepre  pgameMethod is a JAVA method that simply generates 2 random numbers, adds them to get the correct answer and then prompts the user using an EditText field to type in their guess.  It displays the random numbers and answer using TextView boxes created in an XML layout file.p  pEach call to the gameMethod would, at least I think, just reinput the randomized numbers into the TextView fields displayed on the screen each iteration.  I really dont care what the previous numbers were so I figured I would just overwrite them.  I want able to get the code to do that though.  I put in a Log.d statement or two and found that the FOR loop was in fact running through correctly 10 times, but it was not waiting for user input before firing off its next gameMethod.  p  pIn doing some looking around, I found the startActivityForResult and wondered if this was a more appropriate way of approaching this.  So in this way, I foresee having three Activities, the Main menu which calls the GameActivity which would then iterate through, say 10 times, each iteration calling yet another activity GameScreenActivity which would actually put the numbers on the screen, read in user input and then return 1 for a correct answer and 0 for an incorrect answer.  So far in reading up on StarActivityForResult Im getting somewhat confused by the process and wondered if this was even a plausible path to be exploring.p  pAgain, Im very new at this Android programming and appreciate any and all help that I can get.p  pThank you.p  pSorry for not including the gameMethod initially, Ive added it below.p  precode Create and initialize arrays of integers     int[] a  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10     int[] b  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10       Creates random number generator     Random randy  new Random       Generates two random values to add     int r1  randy.nextInt10     int r2  randy.nextInt10       Calculates correct answer     int an  a[r1]  a[r2]        Displays 1st number     TextView number1  TextView findViewByIdR.id.firstNumber     number1.setTextInteger.toStringa[r1]       Displays 2nd number      TextView number2  TextView findViewByIdR.id.secondNumber     number2.setTextInteger.toStringb[r2]       Displays correct answer      TextView answer1  TextView findViewByIdR.id.answerNumber      hide answer until user puts in theirs     answer1.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE     answer1.setTextInteger.toStringan      hide the answer place holder value     TextView uAnswerDisplay  TextView findViewByIdR.id.userAnswerNumber     uAnswerDisplay.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE      Get the EditText field that the user will input their answer to     EditText inputText  EditText findViewByIdR.id.userInput      set up a listener to run once the ENTER key is hit after their answer has been entered     inputText.setOnKeyListenernew EditText.OnKeyListener         public boolean onKeyView v, int keyCode, KeyEvent event      only go on the ENTER key when pressed DOWN     ifevent.getAction  KeyEvent.ACTIONDOWN ampamp           keyCode   KeyEvent.KEYCODEENTER      EditText innerInputText  EditText findViewByIdR.id.userInput get the EditText box reference                 TextView innerUAnswerDisplay  TextView findViewByIdR.id.userAnswerNumber get the TextView box that the answer will go in                 String inputString  innerInputText.getText.toString capture the users input                  int uAnswer  Integer.parseIntinputString parse user answer to an integer                 int cAnswer  Integer.parseIntTextView findViewByIdR.id.answerNumber.getText.toString                 innerUAnswerDisplay.setTextInteger.toStringuAnswer display the string after converting from integer                  change colors of text based on correctness                 if uAnswer  cAnswer innerUAnswerDisplay.setTextColorColor.GREEN  green for correct                 else  innerUAnswerDisplay.setTextColorColor.RED  red for incorrect                  innerUAnswerDisplay.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE make the user input answer visible                  TextView innerAnswer1  TextView findViewByIdR.id.answerNumber                 innerAnswer1.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE hide answer until user puts in theirs              end of if             return false return false           end of onKey       end of setOnKeyListener codepre  pSorry for all the edits, I couldnt get the edits to include the code and post correctly so I broke it up into chunks and added a little at a time.p

Negative 520 pSo, this is probably a really, really stupid question.  Sorry about that, Im a total newbie. Um, Im getting a lot of invalid byte sequence in UTF8 type errors. I found a solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2982677ruby19invalidbytesequenceinutf8herea scroll down for the 24 one, but I have no idea how to actually implement it. Do I type it in the head of the affected files Do I have to install anything else Also, which solution is better, the ignore one or the doubleencoding onep  pAlso bonus noob question The code Im fiddling with now is actually shared code, which means that its presumably worked for a lot of other people without the UTF8 problem. Any idea why my computer especially seems to be unable to get it working Thanks.p

Negative 520 pI was thinking that for some projects I do 60fps is not totally needed. I figured I could have more objects and things that ran at 30fps if I could get it to run smoothly at that framerate. I figured if I edited the requestAnimationFrame shim inside of three.js I could limit it to 30 that way. But I was wondering if there was a better way to do this using three.js itself as provided. Also, will this give me the kind of performance increase I am thinking. Will I be able to render twice as many objects at 30fps as I will at 60 I know the difference between running things at 30 and 60, but will I be able to get it to run at a smooth constant 30fpsp  pI generally use the WebGLRenderer, and fall back to Canvas if needed except for projects that are targeting one specifically, and typically those are webgl shader projects.p

Negative 520 pIm working on an API call with Flickr, that returns results per photo like    p  precodeltphoto id7503362468 owner59044395N02 secret66b94027db server8423 farm9 titlePotluck ispublic1 isfriend0 isfamily0 gt codepre  pNow, according to Flickrs URLAPI documentation, their URLs are structured like this, with the mstzbs being oneletter indicators of the size of the photop  precodehttpfarmfarmid.staticflickr.comserverididsecret[mstzb].jpg codepre  pSo, my question has to do with a mass search and replace that can take each line, prepend the codehttpfarmcode and then basically just fill in the blanks for the rest. The goal would be to use the API to fetch a restful XML that I can then throw the replacer at and have a list of URLs get generated. I have a brief familiarity with sed  admittedly no wizard at it  but Im just unsure of how to do a search and replace per line, that prepends, then replaces in the proper order. Of course, the farmid is the first to go into the URL, and is the fifth field in the XML  what I mean is the search and replace pattern follows the same locations for each line. Admittedly, again, Im just getting started with regextype stuff and any help would be appreciated. I also see that this sort of question has been asked before, but they seemed to be focused on how to create URL syntax rather than a sedstyle replace. Like I said, my sed knowledge is more based around simple codesunnecessarynecessarycode  I am just unsure of how to pick out certain quoted fields and move them into a preformed line.p  pedit A little more info  Im using Flickrs API Explorer to generate these XML files, and typically work with bash for editing. I think what I am after here is more along the lines of a bash script or possibly even a piece of hopefully executable programming language. I will hasten to add that although I do have a little familiarity working with languages like python, I have zero to no experience with writing code aside from bash scripts.

I have been looking around, and I am very confused with how to get facebook chat working on the app engine.

I have heard that the app engine supports http requests, can anyone recommend a good java library for xmpp which uses http rather than tcp p  pDoes this mean that facebook chat cannot be done on the app engine directly Any helpsuggestions are greatly appreciated. p

Negative 520 pI have a couple of classes which use an API of one internal subsystem. We parse and use its responses with lxml.objectify to go through the nodes with object.property syntax.p  pBut the problem is that the code becomes really cluttered and nonpythonic since in some cases, if some property of the object does not exist, API just do not return the whole xml node related to this property amp subproperties.p  pThis results in the code likep  precodeif hasattrobject,property     if hasattrobject.property,subproperty         etc... codepre  pIs there any pythonic way to do things like that or just some good practices.

Negative 520 pI need to implement some authorization mechanism in my application. The authorization is based on object which are sent from client to serwer.

Negative 520 pI was going through Android a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentstasksandbackstack.html relnofollowTask and Back Stack documentationa and at one point they mention thisp  blockquote   pif your application allows users to start a particular activity from more than one activity, a new instance of that activity is created and pushed onto the stack rather than bringing any previous instance of the activity to the top.

Negative 520 pIn a comment on the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12866291arenewtypesfasterthanenumerations titletestprevious questiona, I claimedp  blockquote   pI have another benchmark to indicate ghc7.4.1llvm does unpacking of enumerations on strict data fields.p blockquote  pIn fact, after some experimentation, I believe that, in at least some simplistic cases, using an enumeration is at least as fast as, and actually might be more memory efficient hence faster in a more realistic application than using a newtype of Word8 or Int, even when used in a strict field of a datatype. As I said in the previous question, I have experienced the similar phenomenon in a more realistic but still small setting. p  pCan anyone point me to some relevant references as to what optimizations ghcllvm does for enumerations In particular, does it really unpack the internal tag of the enumeration on a strict data field The assembly output and the result of profiling seem to suggest that that is the case, but to me there is no indication on the core level. Any insights will be greatly appreciated.p  pOne more question Are enumerations emalwaysem at least as efficient as newtypes of the corresponding Integral, where using them makes sense Note that enumerations can behave like Integrals,too. If not, what is the hopefully realistically useful exception Daniel Fischer suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12866291arenewtypesfasterthanenumerations titletesthis answera that putting an enumeration on a strict field of a multipleconstructor datatype might prevent certain optimizations. However I have failed to verify this in the twoconstructor case. Maybe there is a difference when putting them in a large multipleconstructor datatypes p  pIm also curious about what exactly is happening in the following benchmark. In all the four cases, roughly the same amount of bytes were allocated in the heap. However, for enumerations, the GC actually did less copying and the maximum residencies were smaller compared to newtypes.p  pActually my real question was, emis it worthwhile to to try and convert enumerations to newtypes when performance mattersem , but I assumed that being a bit more specific might be more helpful.p  pA possible implication of this question would be this If you are using a large number of Ints in your program which actually varies on some very small subset, then changing them to an enumeration rather than to an unboxed type might be a performance gain but careful for strictness.p  pHere is the summary of the benchmark, followed by the benchmark code and the convenience makefile for testing on your system.p  pre benchmarking d mean 11.09113 ns, lb 11.06140 ns, ub

Negative 520 pI have a few million records with a list of names and phone numbers. I need to count how many people are associated with each unique phone number. The phone numbers are associated with duplicate names and unique names. So for each phone number I need to count the number of distinct users. Then this needs to be mapped to a list of stores. I tried selecting distinct phonesdistinct phones but that only gives me a ratio of a distribution. So for example, if there is 10 people using three phones, then my ratio tells me that 3 phones are distributed among 10 people, but it doesnt tell me the actual number of people withn that distribution associated with the phone. Can anyone please help me with the SAS code to get the correct count where I know exactly how many phones are associated with the same phone number. Thanks in advance. rp

Negative 520 pI need to model a list of items which is sorted by the time of last update of the item.p  pConsider for instance a user task list.

Negative 520 pstrongExplanation of the problemstrongp  pA PHP function is normally called in the following mannerp  precodemyFunctionparameter codepre  pIf parameter isnt set though, PHP will throw an error. A solution to that would be doing it as followsp  precodeif isset parameter      myFunctionparameter  codepre  pHowever, it can get really annoying to have to use an if check every time you wanted to call that function and are unsure if its set. The first thing I thought was declaring the function like sop  precodefunction myFunctionlocal      ifissetlocal              Code goes here.       codepre  pBut calling the function didnt work, as PHP doesnt seem to support feeding unset variables to a function as a parameter. To get around this, I used variable variablesp  precodefunction myFunctionlocal      ifissetlocal              Code goes here.        myFunctionparameter codepre  pTo see how variable variables work, refer to the a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenlanguage.variables.variable.php relnofollowPHP Manuala.p  pThis was working fine, until I needed to make checks on array indexes. To solve this, I created a different function to work on arrays that are certain to be setp  precodemyFunctionArrayarray,key      ifissetarray[key]              Code goes here.       variable  array myFunctionArrayparameter,key codepre  pIn this case, since variable is set, and key is a harmless string, there will be no errors despite variable[key] not being set, and you can successfully make the isset check inside the function. However, this obviously doesnt support multidimensional arrays. To give support to multidimensional arrays, one would have to add more parameters to the function in anticipation to the number of dimensions the array is expected to have. Either of these two functions could workp  precodemyFunctionMultiArrayarray,key1,key2,key3      ifissetarray[key1][key2][key3]              Code goes here.       myFunctionMultiArray2array,keys      ifissetarray[keys[0]][keys[1]][keys[2]]              Code goes here.       variable  array myFunctionMultiArrayparameter,key1,key2,key3 myFunctionMultiArray2parameter,arraykey1,key2,key3 codepre  pAnother problem, now were getting our hands full with functions, one for each array depth. How do we make it so that the function can be fed an array with any depthp

Negative 520 pI am student working on an academic project  strongPorting KVM to MAC OS Xstrong. I gathered a lot of literature regarding KVM, MAC OS X etc., But, I am still unclear as how to proceed. I checked Apples Developer website which lists a hundred things to do for the porting process.I dont understand why Mac, having UNIX at its heart, needs a lot of changes to the source code, just to make it run.  Also, I heard that strongFinkstrong and also strongmacportsstrong is a tool, using which I can port any Unix application to Mac OS X. Is that true I checked Finks website, where in I dont find any details which suggests that I can use Fink as a tool for porting. All I see is strongFinkstrong and also strongmacportsstrong is a package management system which has several linux applications and will run only those applications on Mac. KVM is not there on the list. So, again I am confused. Please suggest me, how to go about it Just one step. Is the way Apple community suggesting, the only way Please help. p

Negative 520 pIm trying to create a table of inputs that automatically adds a new row when you enter text in one of the inputs on the bottom line. For the most part, it works fine. However, Im having some trouble with jQuery UI checkbox buttons.p  pThe checkbox buttons are supposed to change their icon when clicked. This works fine for the original buttons, but the cloned button that appears when you add a new row doesnt work properly.p  pYou can see it a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCugb61 relnofollowin jsfiddle herea. To replicate the issue, put some text in the third input down. Youll see that a fourth row appears. If you press the fourth checkbox, youll see the third checkbox is the one whose icon changes. The wrong button also gets uistatefocus but doesnt actually get focus, which really baffles me, though the correct button does get uistateactive and seems, as far as I can tell, to evaluate as having been checked properly.p  pTo be clear, the two checkboxes do emnotem have the same ID, and their labels are for the right checkbox  the createNewRow function takes care of that. If you comment out the line that turns the checkboxes into jQuery UI checkboxes, youll see everything works fine. If you console.log the value of this.attrid in the buttonSwitchCheck function, youll see that it has the right ID there too  if you click the fourth button, itll tell you that the id of this is test4, but its test3 the third button that gets the icon change.p  pIm going mad staring at this and Id appreciate any help people can give.

Negative 520 pI have a question with the classical gradient descent algorithm. Recently I want to implement a function fitting program provided the observed data as well as the parameters of the function is given.

Suppose the function parameters are given, I can create the simulated data based on the function  p  precodeclean rngdefault rng54321 lowvalue  15 highvalue  200 disvalue   highvaluelowvalue2 centralvalue  lowvaluehighvalue2 x  155 centralpixel  1lengthx2 delta  3 len  lengthx ytrue  disvalueerfxcentralpixel.deltacentralvalue y  ytrue  randn1,len figureplotx,y,b hold on plotx,ytrue,r codepre  pThe figure below shows the simulated data blur asterisk points as well as the potential function in red img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeerU0.png altenter image description here As you can see from the figure there are two parameters to estimate in this example, one is the center point position p and the other is the standard derivation delta, and the function is written asp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdIuvQ.png altenter image description herep  pwhere A and B can be regarded as known. Then if I want to use gradient descent algorithm, I should do two things one is define the derivatives of the function for the two unknown parameters p and delta respectively, and the other is to invoke the gradient descent algorithm. However, what I have found confusing is that during the iterative procedure one of the estimated parameters delta does not go to the right direction all the time p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com15X82.png altenter image description herep  pI do notice, however, that object function the sum of the square distance between the fitting point and the estimated function is always becoming smaller img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX42Tg.png altenter image description herep  pMy question is then why the solutions do not always go to the right direction even though in the end they can reach the right place.

Negative 520 pI have a program which uses C ndk subroutines in jni which processes a 3204x2406 image file which takes 6 seconds when run without debug by eclipse with NDKDEBUG0.p  pIve got the same code compiled with GCC on the android running in the shell at under 1 second.p  pThe code consists of loops and integer math. Both the eclipse ndk program and the gcc shell program access the exact same file from the exact same location. There are no trace statements within the 6 seconds. The only external calls is 2406 read statements. p  pThe eclipse is the google integrated download 21.0.0, which is uses Juno 4.2.1 and cc 8.1.1. And yes, ive restarted eclipse and cleaned the project.p  pIm now thinking about trying to call or link to the GCC code, but keep feeling like I must be missing something silly. p
Negative 520 pI have a 4bit number representation in JavaScript, that represent the 4 times of the day morning, afternoon, evening, night.p  pSo lets say I have the number 13 1101 in decimal, it represent that some action has to be done in the night, evening and morning not afternoon, as the 2nd bit is 0.p  pWhat I did so far is get the 4bit digit that represents the day 1000 is night, 0100 is evening, 0010 is afternoon, 0001 is morning, and what I want to do is create a function that compares the 2 numbers, and returns true if the bit at certain position is equal to one.p  pI am aware of bitwise operators, but I tried to use them but still no luck.p
Negative 520 pIm implementing a turnbased game with multiplayer mode through gamecenter. I have 2 devices 1 ipad, 1 iphone to test in sandbox mode which were working fine but lately it has started to struggle in auto matchmaking process. After I send the first turn from one user, the other device doesnt immediately recognize that game but opens up its own fresh game. Before it was able to immediately spot the game started in the other device and matchmaking was fairly straightforward. And I dont remember changing any parts relevant to matchmaking codeNSCodingcode, codeGKTurnBasedEventHandlercode, codeGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllerDelegatecode delegate methods etc. p  pNow I send the first turn from one device and need to wait around 1 min so the other device can successfully connect to that game. After connection occurs endTurnWithMatchData calls work without any problems, it can send and receive data within 12 secs. But it wont be a good UX if users start a fresh game and had to wait 1 min so another user can connect to his game. Has anyone been experiencing significant lag in auto matchmaking process I didnt implement invitations yet, so I cannot check it. The matchdata I archive with NSKeyedArchiver seemed quite big, 3396 bytes, even for a fresh game with almost no data.

Negative 520 pUsing TFS 2012 doing a build with default XAML template. I need to determine the exact pathname of the TRX file that MSTest outputs during the build.  I know I can get TestResultsDirectory, but I want the file name too. It defaults to a long name consisting of the current user  datetime and stuff. Thats fine, I just want to obtain that name during the build. I know I can override the output name using a testsettings file, and force the name to be the same for every build, but I dont want that. I want to have a datetime stamp so the trx files are distinct across builds. I attempted to add a command line argument to the MSTest activity resultsfileblahblah  but the MSTest activity rejects that argument as unsupported. Is there some property or some way to obtain this name during the buildp

Negative 520 pI have a page that has 39 check boxes. The check boxes in my example resemble form names. My problem is that with 39 check boxes I need a way to store what forms were given to a student. Currently what I have set up is that each form is separated with a comma and a quote so that when a report is run the Administrator can use a CSV download option and group which forms a student has received. This works but is very rudimentary and also gives a bad side affect that before each form name a  is present because mysql escapes quotes. p  pThis is what I currently have  p  precode if thisgtinputgtpostaction  additional       givenforms         foreach thisgtinputgtpostform as forms        givenforms . ,  . forms .                   comments  This student was given . givenforms .           if thisgtinputgtpostaction  additional ampamp thisgtinputgtpostother  OTHER              comments . , .thisgtinputgtpostcounselorcomments            codepre  pAgain in the database the results will look like  This student was given xyz, eoe, wwo, p  pPretty much I just need ideas on how to store which forms a student was given, and if needed if all 39 forms are given to a student I need to store all forms the student was given for later reporting. even though 39 forms wont be given p
Negative 520 h3Current Situationh3  pIm writing a hrefhttpsgithub.comdbrgnorochi relnofollowa small Python programa to play playlists from 8tracks in your terminal.p  pIt consists of three parts, a codeclient.pycode using the stdlibs a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarycmd.html relnofollowcmda module, an codeapi.pycode module that uses pythonrequests to access the API and a codeplayer.pycode module that creates an mplayer subprocess in slave mode and sends commands to it.p  h3Problemh3  pThis works so far, the problem is that I have no other way to tell if a song has finished playing in mplayer except for polling the subprocess stdout. This means I have to watch the process so I can request and start the next song of the playlist after a song has finished playing.p  pThe problem is that waiting for the subprocess would block the codecmdcode modules main loop. I cant simply run it in a separate thread or process either though, because I would have to share the reference to the subprocess stdout, and references like these cant be shared between processes.p  h3Possible approachesh3  pI thought of different solutions for this. I could put codeplayer.pycode in a separate process and send textcommands via a queue, but that would overcomplicate things. I could create a Twisted app, but Twisted is pretty big and I dont know where to start. Also, Id prefer not to have such a dependency in my project.p  pA third solution would be to use Gevent. The question is how I would get this to work with the codecmdcode module. As far as I understood Gevent, I would have to yield in every place where Im waiting for something. In this case, this would be during the HTTP requests, when waiting during the codecmd.cmdloopcode and in the pauses between the subprocess polling. But how do I get the codecmdcode module to yield Some kind of subclass or monkey patchingp

So that when the status code is greater than 0, we know there was a problem. However, the way the software was written, it doesnt always log what command or application returned the status code. So that if the status code was say 32768, when divided by 256, the status code reported is strong128strong.p  pThe software is old and while I could make changes, it would be nice if any of the commands called or applications called reported their original status code elsewhere.p  pIs there a way to determine the original status code in a standard Linux log file and the application which returned itp

Negative 520 pIm trying to rank points from a SQL select however only when the points arent tied with other points in the returned results.p  pThe SQL Query that I am usingp  precodeSET rank0 SELECT , rankrank1 AS rank FROM points codepre  pQuite simple And it displays the following resultsp  precodeid  userid  points  rank  2   133845   220     1 3   134084   220     2 4        1   150     3 5   134086   145     4 6   134080   100     5 7    17938    30     6 8    83011    20     7 9       26     5     8 10  134077     5     9 11  134074     5     10 codepre  pAs you can see ID 2 and 3 have the same amount of points and so does ID 9, 10 , and 11.

Negative 520 pI am writing tests for an application using Outlook Redemption that absolutely must run 64bit it connects to windows MAPI and Outlook x64.  Unfortunately, I cannot for the life of me make it run the test in 64bit.  I have tried using a code.runsettingscode file edited to indicate 64bit and a code.testsettingscode file also edited, and finally I have selected codeTestgtTestSettingsgtDefault Processor Architecturegt64bitcode, to no avail.p  pEvery time, System.Environment.Is64BitProcess is false, and when I load the dll to connect to Outlook and MAPI I get the dreaded COM Exception codeWrong OS or OS version for application Exception from HRESULT 0x800401FA COEWRONGOSFORAPPcode which indicates that 64bit Outlook is installed and the process trying to access it is 32bit.p  pI have restarted VS 2012 after making settings changes as I have read somewhere that a restart may be necessary.  Does anyone have any other suggestions  I emcouldem just write this as a console app that runs informal tests and reports their status, but my next step is to get these tests integrated into the automated build.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  h1Edith1  pScreenshot of Host Settings page in .testsettings img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQdwq8.png altenter image description herep  h1Experimenth1  pInterestingly, I did a little experiment.  I created a new solution with a single console app project.  I put a public method in there that just returned true.  When I ran the console app, and paused execution, I looked and indeed it is running 64bit no problem there.  I then added a test project, created a single test which called the method.  I also added codevar is64  Environment.Is64bitProcesscode and put a breakpoint after it.p  pPredictably, without changing any options, is64 was false.  I chose the 64bit default architecture from the dropdown under test, then cleaned the solution, and ran the test again, same result, running 32bit.  I restarted VS2012, cleaned, built, same result.  I created a testsettings file and referenced it in the Test menu, clean build, same, restart,clean, build same.  I created a runsettings file, set codeltTargetPlatformgtx64ltTargetPlatformgtcode , referenced that in the test menu, ran through it all again, and came up with the same results.  QTAgent32.exe continues to run the process, and absolutely refuses to heed my demands that it run 64 bit.  p  pI swear, if I have to delete QTAgent32.exe and rename QTAgent to that name, I will.  I am not above cramming my wishes down the computers throat when it wants to be obstinate.  Please, if you dont want to see me mistreat a workstation, someone show me what is going wrong.  Think of the computers.p

Negative 520 pI have a project in which I need to make neural network for face recognition.  Inputs of network should be features of face which needs to be recognized.p  pI searched a lot and found SURF Detector of Matlabs Computer Vision Toolbox to be the one which will help me extract the features of face. But SURF Detector extracts keypoints of face and for each of them sets vector with 64 or 128 values. Problem is that the number of keypoints varies,and I need it to be same for each face, to be able to feed the inputs of neural network.p  pSo i thought to extract only some features which can be presented as single number, like proportions of nose,mouth,eyes to the face, or distance between eyes, etc.br How can i get these features, and will they be good enough to serve as inputs to neural network which will need to recognize faces On the output of neural network there will be same number of neurons as there is different people in database, and in training phase Im going to feed the network with extracted face features from photo, and if it is photo of lets say third of five people in database, my output layer will look like [0,0,1,0,0].p  pIs this good approach and can you give me some code which extracts those face features from face in Matlabp

Lines B and C have the exact same length and fields. Line D is a possible complement to line C, meaning that it is attached to a line C but not required also meaning there cannot be a line D without a line C. Lines E and F are independent lines, only attached to line A. all lines are part of a block, so they could all be attached to a line A, or a virtual block IDp  pHow would I go about to create a model that would allow me to  modify some data on some lines based on some criteria ie, if 5th char of line C is 4, then 10th becomes 7  keep track of the modified ones ie, I want to be able to link them to their original selves  Be able to rebuild the original text file, deleting the original lines and replacing them by their modified version  Be able to insert new lines in the block if line C has 7th char  0 then I add below it a D line.  keep the line order intact. if one line is inserted, it moves the order for the following line by  1 rank aheadp  pI thought about using a parentid foreign key in all 5 line tables one per each line type, since they do not have the same fields thus resolving the line ordering issue, but I am stuck at rebuilding the modified file version. I also thought about dividing the file into blocks starting by a line A, then linking lines to block ID...p  pAny suggestion would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 520 pNo errors, compiles, no run time error. Hey, I have a simple question about Android sum. Im doing a simple summation, the code compiles, it does technically do what it suppose to do, sum the number until its greater than 120. However, I wanted the output to show each sum as it goes through the loop. Unfortunately, it just jumps immediately to the last sum on the textview. I tried using a sleep function, wait function, but what ended up happening was it would wait the amount of time for all the loops until the sum was greater than 120, then output the final sum. In this case 4950. Any suggestions for showing each sum on the text viewp  pI also tried using this line of code, which worked in showing each sum individually, however, it started the timer immediately.

Negative 520 pI have a project P that references two dlls say A.dll and B.dll. A.dll in turn references version 1.0.0.0 of X.dll and B.dll refences version 2.0.0.0 of X.dll.  So when I run the code of P I need to to have both versions of X available for it. For certain reasons I dont want to GAC either. So I thought to simply put them in the bin folder, but with different file names X.dll and X.v2.dll.

Negative 520 pI am struggling with making something work using DOM Dynamic Rows, and totalling them, but only in IE7. p  pIt seems to work fine in Safari, IE8, Firefox and Chrome, and I know what everyone will say...dont use IE7.

Negative 520 pIm making an XNA 4 game, and I want to create checkpoints for certain areas in my stage. I figured I could create a ghost object of the player object that would be created whenever the player reaches a checkpoint. And when you want to reload that checkpoint, youll start to where that ghost player is. As for now, I thought this would be an easy way to achieve this although I think XML may be a better solution, but Ive no idea on how to use that, yet. But the player has too many variables health, stamina, ammo, bleeding timer, silver keys, golden keys, coins, infection, position, speed, angle, states [involve dying, infected, bleeding, burning, dodging, etc], I just thought that statemets like continuep1  p1 both are instances of the same object would reassign all the variables to the values that the other class contains, but when I tried to reload p1  continuep1 it wouldnt work. It doesnt seem to do anything.p  pSo Im wondering, do I have to reassign ALL the variables one by one Should I start using XML Or is there a way to assign all the variables without having to do it one by one Im not asking for code, unless the last question is possiblep

Negative 520 pIm in the process of designing models for a codeDjangocode app and I cant quite work out how to approach a problem.p  pI have 3 models. codeServercode, codeModulecode, and codeDevicecode.p  pcodeServercode is a server that a module could run on. codeModulecode runs on a server, and contains devices.p  pThe problem with codeDevicescode is that the name is always a field, but the attributes could change.p  pI considered just putting a codeJSONcode value in attributes but I couldnt figure out how to do that with Django admin.p  pBasically the user will enter a name for the device and depending on which module it is attached to, show various different fields to fill in.p  pFor examplep  precodemodule rfmninjablock Device fields would be name and code  module LimitlessLED Device fields would be name, controller, group and LightID codepre  pIs there a straightforward way to do it or am I going about it the wrong wayp

Negative 520 pWhat would be the best way to structure a database and mvc app for the fastest look ups possible when trying to retrieve a list of items within a certain radius in miles and also  depending on the items zip code. I am open to suggestions even if it involves change to my current set up.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMgCbe.jpg altSimple Schemap  pI am currently using a .txt file that contains zip codes and latlon coordinates to calculate distances. With the use of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHaversineformula relnofollowHaversine Formulaa you can calculate distance between two points using the coordinates.   p  pI am using codePagedList 1.17.0.0code to page my data on my index controller. The main problem I am facing pertains to EF. When selecting items within a 50 mile distance my SQL statements become too nested and throw errors in EF. p  pCurrent Flow of controllerp  precodepublic ActionResult Indexstring sortOrder, string Categories, string Manufacturers, int page, bool clearFilters  false          ,string DistanceLimit  , int Vehicle  0   codepre  pEach string in the parameters section is a possible filter for EF to use. Since I cannot tell EF to codeobject.WhereP gt P.Distance lt 50code  p  pI generate a raw query using a string builder. My ZipCode class retrieves all zips within a 50 mile radius and then constructs a simple select with each zip code as a parameter in the where clause. This is where the problem occurs due to the fact that there are too many where clauses. 25 mile radius is fine, but not 50.p  pIn the event that the above functionality works it fetches primary keys of items within that distance. I then have EF select codeItem.IncludeP gt P.Manufacturer.IncludeP gt P.Category.Include3 other tablescodep  pI then call codeToListcode on my codeIQueryablecode and remove any codeItemcodes that are not within my previous list of PKs.   p  pFinally, I call codeToPagedListcode and return that to my view within a viewmodel.  p  pAs you can see there is alot going on here.   p  pstrongFor Onestrong it does not work past a 25 miles radius.   p  pstrong2strong it is overly complex and feels like a Rube Goldberg machine.  p  pstrong3strong All these separate query executions significantly impact search result speed.  p  pAs I said earlier, I am open to any suggestions from anyone who has made a system with similar functionality. I have never dealt with geospatial data and am recently aware of SQL Servers geography type however, from my understanding, it seems that I would have to call codeStDistancecode on every latlon record in order to figure out which items are near. Not to mention I will have to move my .txt file to the dB.p

The row names of the matrix refer to cpg sites which range in nonnumerical and nonascending order e.g. cg00000029 cg00000108 cg00000109 cg00000165, while the column names refer to participant IDs which are also in nonnumerical and nonascending order e.g. 11209 14140 1260 5414.p  pI would like to identify which beta methylation values are  0.5 so that I can exclude them from further analyses.

It then groups them by whether they are even or odd. So, the grouped observable ends up being of type codeObservable[Long, Observable[MyCaseClass]]code, as per the RXJava spec.p  pHowever, when we come to subscribe to a groupedby observable, type erasure means the signature of the nested Observable is lost i.e. we cant tell whether it is CaseOne or CaseTwo it becomes of type codeAnycode  the compiler warns about this, and so the output isp  precodeCase one Case one Case one ... codepre  pstrongMy question is, in the above scenario, how do you handle the type erasure of the nested Observablestrongp  pMy only workaround so far has been to include an extra value in the key which is used to identify the nested Observable type, and then to cast using codeasInstancecode to this type.

I tried to write a loop, but struggled with the aspect that for each company the value of year 1 has to be used in order to calculate the differences.p  pTo clarify, when a new company in companycode occurs the expenses over the following years need to be compared to the expenses in year 1.p  pI know that looping for data frame is inefficient, thats why I thought that the functions tapply,apply,sapply etc. might be a good approach... Would be great if someone is keen to do it that way.p  pI hope its clear and you guys can help me out.p  pThanks in advance. p

How can I have different implementations while providing the user with one function for the interface.p  pThis is essentially MCU register modifier that operates on two registers because one does not have the capacity. Id rather not use any dirty offsets based on N inside the function and depend on plain structure. Also Id rather not use helper functions which would complicate things if it is possible without them.p

Negative 520 pI am using a small standard Azure Website instance with autoscale turned on.p  pMy Asp.net application has to initialise warm up, compile some objects which take a little time, can be around 4 mins. I decided to do it up front rather than when a user hits the relevant code. However this setup seems to knock the Web instance offline with a 503 error, which is really surprising to me, since I thought Azure was very resilient. It is fine if it takes longer, and is subject to a bit of throttling, which one would only expected on Shared instances. Anyway 503 should not happen.p  pAny thoughts on how I can prevent this happening, except write more efficient code, which I am trying to do, but it cannot happen short term, so hoping for a Azure centric solution. In any case I am totally surprised that Azure Website Standard instance seem to throw 503s too easily, and become unavailable.p  pWhen I retry, after leaving for about 4 min, the site becomes available again, but my startup code will then return it to a 503 situation. When the startup code is implemented through the application when needed there is no issue apart from delaying the user. So code itself is not causing a problem, apart from running for a little while.p  pThanks in advance,p  pEDIT I think there is a 2 min limit in Azure Websites, which I may be exceedingp

Negative 520 pCurrently Turn Based Multiplayer games expire in 2 weeks. Is there an option to set it to another valuep
Negative 520 pI just finished installing Android Studio and the JDK. Everything worked fine while I looked around the new interface. No errors or anything. After I checked for updates I went from version 0.5.2 to 0.6. When I restarted I got the errorp  blockquote   pErrorThe SDK Build Tools revision 19.0.3 is too low for project app. Minimum required is 19.1.0p blockquote  pWhich SDK is it referring to and shouldnt it update along with Android Studio Before I updated I did not have this message.p
Negative 520 pIt says p  blockquote   pA tuple can not be changed in any way once it is created.p blockquote  pBut when I do the followingp  precodet14,5,8,2,3 t1t17,1 printt1 codepre  pthe tuple is changing to code4, 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, 1code why is that What is really meant by tuples are immutablep
Negative 520 pMy computer has 2 network interfaces which are connected in 2 different networks and when I start the JMeter slave the wrong network interface is automatically chosen.p
Negative 520 pI am working on some Graphs using JavaFX, and I use a few line charts to get my result. There is however a problem. I think that the following code will explain what Im trying to dop  precodewhilestartTime.getTimeInMillis lt endTime.getTimeInMillis      int index  getIndexstartTime     ifindex  1          N k  dataList.getindex         DataltString, Ngt point  new DataltString, NgtdistanceList.getindex  , k         series.getData.addpoint          int newMinutes  startTime.getCalendar.MINUTE5     startTime.setCalendar.MINUTE, newMinutes  codepre  pThis code fills a series JavaFX a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenechartXYChart.Series.html relnofollowsee herea and other code sets it in a chart which is not the problem. The above code retrieves the index by using the time. The indexes retrieved are all in ascending order, I already checked that. The distanceList is a list in ascending order and the dataList is not.p  pSo all the datapoints in the series are added with the x values in an ascending order, but whenever this is set, I get a graph where all the X labels are messed up and therefore also the line itself. The x labels dont have equal spacing and sometimes are over each other. I searched the internet and found some similar problems of others, which some of them said it was a bug in JavaFX. I am running the newest version of Java and JavaFX, respectively 1.8 and 8.p  pEverything is working fine, all values are correct as I checked it multiple times. Its just the labels on xaxis that are not shown properly. I have no clue in what the problem is, do some of you knowp
Negative 520 pI have real data type values in my database. But when i try print php i can see very long numbersp  precode512.2   501.12  506.66 in db  variable  row[columnname] codepre  pthen i receive values like  512.20001220703 and  501.11999511719p  phow to parse in to normal formatp
Negative 520 pI am currently working with User Defined Functions and having a hard time grasping the concept around how the function accepts one parameter and returns another one.p  pI have a table that has Employee ID and Log IDs.  The UDF should accepts the EmployeeID and returns UserLoginID.  The UserLoginID is the last part of the LogID column after the .

Negative 520 pI have a .NET MVCWebApi app which sets up Culture for the current thread during the ASP.NET AcquireRequestState event we use custom logic to determine the preferred ui culture for each of our users.

I agree that both of these questions are related, but they are not the same One asks about setting one culture for the whole app, which is the opposite of what Im trying to do. The other tackles setting culture for MVC3style async controllers, which is a small and, to me, largely irrelevant subset of what Id like to accomplish.p

Negative 520 pWe are experiencing an issue, that calling parse functions that return some data is very slow on iOS compared to Android. Especially with iOS 8 8.0.2 and 8.1 and in 3GLTE network. Sometimes it takes up to 10 seconds until the response is received, while on Android calling the same function always takes lt 1 second. It seems that on some older iOS devices its faster than on the new iPhone 6. We also tested side by side in the same WiFi network with an iPhone 6 and an iPod Touch, and on the iPod Touch its about 3 times faster.p  pIts a Swift project for iOS 7 and 8. We are not in production mode yet on Parse, but again, on other platforms the cloud functions return very fast. The data that is being returned is usually very small, just a few lines of JSON.p  pThe issue is not reproducible on the simulator. There the same cloud functions return very fast.

Negative 520 pI am maintaining a WPF application that use Entity Framework Code First with migrations not auto. Some of the POCOs in this application are mapped to views that point to another DB. I guess the method used to do this is similar to what is done in this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7461265howtouseviewsincodefirstentityframeworkhow to use views in code first entity frameworkap  pNow I want one of the POCOs Company to point to a table in stead of a view. The POCO has also changed a bit since pointing to the view.p  pWhen I add a migration after doing the changes in the POCO and in the CompanyConfigurationclass changing the ToTable, then it seems that the migration think that the view is an existing table and tries to rename it. For example the start of the Upmethod will look like thisp  precode    RenameTablename dbo.vCompany, newName Company      AlterColumndbo.Company, ParentAccount, c gt c.StringmaxLength 160     AlterColumndbo.Company, Country, c gt c.StringmaxLength 100 codepre  pHowever, I dont want the view to be changed, I want the Companytable to be created from scratch matching the POCO. What would be the correctgood way to accomplish this Is it possible without writing the Up and Down methods myselfp  pCurrently the application uses Entity Framework 6.1, but when this CompanyvCompany mapping was first created, it was version 4.3 I belive.p

Negative 520 pIll try to explain my problem as best I can. So, I have application written in CC language in client application doesnt matter, which is importing one function from DLL for example uint32t GetMemoryPointer. Then it does write in sequences to this memory pointer like thisp  precodeuint32t ptr  uint32tGetMemoryPointer ptr  3 ptr  4 ptr  1050 codepre  pIt does this sequence without any information for DLL that value was changed. Is it possible to watch this value in DLL I tried to make a thread and in loop seek changes but its not reliable. Is there a better solution Im interested in doing this way application writes, DLL finds that value was changed, HOLDS application execution then is interpreting this value then ALLOW application to continue execution. Another way without holding application might be pushing on the stack new value but I need to be informed on every change. The platform Im interested in is Windows. Language doesnt matter may be C or C. Is it possible to achieve this Its really important for me and Im out of ideas. I dont want code but I would like to be informed if it is possible and in which way I need to go. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 520 pI have a piece of equipment Ill be connecting to, and that connection could be over TCPIP or a serial connection.  Im writing a class that models the configuration data, and one of the configuration options is information about that connection.p  pA serial connection has configuration settings like CommPort, BaudRate, Parity, etc.  A TCPIP connection will have Host and Port.p  pSo it seems obvious that Im going to have SerialConnectionInfo and TcpConnectionInfo classes.  But those classes are members of an Equipment class.p  pI seems like there should be some master ConnectionInfo class or interface, but the problem is that while those two classes are conceptually similar, they dont share any common fields.  So something like the following doesnt seem to make any sensep  precodeinterface IConnectionInfo    class SerialConnectionInfo  IConnectionInfo    string CommPort   class TcpConnectionInfo  IConnectionInfo    string Host   class Equipment    IConnectionInfo Connection  codepre  pI emcouldem do something like that, but then at some point Im definitely going to have to check which class Connection is, and cast it to the proper class.  It all smells wrong.  Does anybody have any ideasp

This is similar to how many word processors change the font of a paragraph when the user select a style from a menu not a specific formatting.p  pIdeally, I would like to apply a QTextCharFormat or equivalent to a block paragraph just before it is laid out and rendered, strongbut I would prefer that no font attribute be actually inserted in the text, as I dont want this information in the file but I need to preserve any bolditalicunderline attributes that the user might have set to words within paragraphsstrong I intend to save the needed information in a QTextBlockuserData. However, I cant figure where I would need to insert a function to perform this task.p  pI figured I could not change the QTextCharFormat of a paragraph from either QTextBlock nor QTextCursor as this only applies to new blocks, it doesnt affect blocks with existing text.p  pI checked out QTextLayout but I dont think my answer is there.p  pI have been looking for a solution to this problem for a few days now. I would be really gracious for any pointer in the right direction.p  pI have years of experience with C, but Im somewhat new to Qt. Using Qt 4.8.p  pEditp  pI added emphasize bold above to an important part of what Im trying to do. In other word, what Id really like to do is be able to apply the font attributes to the block of text perhaps a temporary copy just before it is displayed. Im totally comfortable with deriving and modifying even reimplement any class that I need to in order to achieve that goal, but I need to be pointed to the right direction as to what I actually need to change. As a last resort, I could also modify some Qt class directly if that is necessary for the task, but again would need to know what class I need to touch. I hope this is clearer. I find it difficult to explain this without being allowed to tell you what the application will do exactly.p

Negative 520 pI am creating an Android game to help people learn to type in Braille. This is not an app for reading Braille with your fingers, but it does include some interactive images of Braille cells.p  pI have created an interface which shows Braille dots on the screen. As you move your fingers over the dots, the device vibrates, and a specific MIDI note is played, depending on which dot you are currently touching.p  pAll well and good. Now for the problem.p  pMost users who want to learn Braille also want to have TalkBack active on their Android phone. However, when TalkBack is active, it intercepts all single finger sliding touch actions. This prevents me from triggering vibrations and MIDI sounds when the user touches with a single finger.p  pI can design my interface to use TalkBack texttospeech but this is a poor solution the main value of my app cannot be conveyed just by texttospeech.p  pI have seen that many other developers have encountered similar difficulties, where TalkBack prevents them from creating value for the very users that TalkBalk is intended to help. Who can I contact at Google to start a discussion that will lead to a tactileuserfriendly solutionp  hr  pEDIT  p  pOne workaround is to ask the user to touch the screen with 2 fingers. One finger will be ignored while the other can be used to explore the screen as if TalkBack were disabled. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict which of the two fingers will be treated as the active finger.p

Negative 520 pWhat I need is a hashing function that operates on fixed data sizes, obviously for non security purposes. It needs to map similar strings to similar or equal hashes, in other words small changes in strings should make no or really small changes to hashes.p  pfor example strongmy name is Johnstrong, strongmy name is Jonstrong should have the same or really similar hashes. strongmy name is Johnstrong, strongyour name is Liamstrong should result in somewhat similar hashes. strongmy name is Johnstrong, strongI live in USAstrong should give totally different hashes. and so onp  pIs there a hashing function for similar purposesp
Negative 520 pIm trying to deploy WAR file into JBoss 7. I placed the WAR file in the standalonedeployments folder. while starting the server Im getting  ClassNotFoundError.

Negative 520 pI have a Rails 4.1.8 app which was developed by a third party it already uses Devise with a User model. I want to use Alchemy just to manage a few mostlystatic pages like about us etc.p  pSo I followed the directions for installing Alchemy CMS 3.1.0rc1 into the existing app, and set codeAlchemy.userclassnamecode in the initializer. I mounted Alchemy under the codepcode path for now to avoid collisions with my existing paths.p  pEverything seems to be working fine, except when I try to view an Alchemy page while logged out, my codeapplication.html.erbcode throws the following errorp  precodeundefined method newusersessionpath for ltltClass0x007fe4c6833ee0gt0x007fe4cb5b8940gt codepre  pThis happens because my app uses codenewusersessionpathcode in codeapplication.html.erbcode, to show a Login link for the guest user. In the regular app, it works fine, and also works fine when I view an Alchemy page when logged in.p  pIm not familiar enough with Devise and Alchemy to figure out where the problem exists. Im guessing its one of two thingsp  ol liwhen there is no loggedin User, the app is creating a guest User for access to other methods on the User model, and Devise doesnt know about this user so it doesnt create the codenewusersessionpathcode helper.li liI have some problem in my routing, and because Alchemy is a mountable engine, there is maybe some logic in my application controller that isnt getting called.li ol  pId prefer to not post my entire routes.rb or application controller, but heres the relevant devise section from the former.p  precode  devisefor users, path gt auth, pathnames gt  signin gt login, signout gt logout,     password gt secret, confirmation gt verification, registration gt register ,     controllers gt          registrations gt authentication,         passwords gt passwords,         omniauthcallbacks gt omniauthcallbacks,         sessions gt sessions           devisescope user do      several getpost definitions here to change various urls   end codepre  pI dont think its 2, because even if I define a codedevisescopecode for a custom path likep  precodedevisescope user do   get login, to devisesessionsnew end codepre  pI get the same problem it works in the main app, and when users are logged in, but not on Alchemy pages with guest User.p

Negative 520 pI went through quite a bit of questions and blog posts about this topic and could not find the answer I was looking for. My ultimate goal is the following When a user clicks on one of the list items  show him a Details Page. Let me stop here for a second  there are different ways that can be done and my goal is to get it done the way so the back navigation is properly functioning. The way I currently do it is not the right way but it works some what here is a brief explanation of it p  hr  pemI have a layout with a listview and a linear layout for a details all within the same layout. Please stop throwing rock at you brother  I was desperate and this is the only way I was able to make it work for now. I show the ListView with all the ListItems  and as soon as one of them is clicked I catch that event and hide the listview and show the linear layout that is like I said store within the same layout. Clicking back would basicaly take you back to the login screen and I wish to make it so clicking back would take you back to ListView one. I tried having 2 different layouts and when user clicks on the LIstItem inflate  inject it instead of the Master One but it did not work. I want all the tabs to be the same  I just want that Master  Detail functionality where I need it. To simplify it  User is on one of the SlidePages clicks on one of the ListItems  boom  Detail Page comes ups Hopefully I dont have to use a pop up fragment that then gets dismissed. User clicks back and it goes back to that same page with ListView. I hope that is not too confusing  please help you brother out  sort me out of throw me some ideas if you dont mind.

Negative 520 pI am a QA Engineer running automated UI tests overnight, distributed over several VMs. However, sometimes a job might hang and it causes a major headache. Can I write a batch file to log into the remote server headless would be best, since the job itself will run on a master VM and kill the process that I need to, and then log back out I have NO experience writing Windows batch scripts. Also  Im using a service account, so no need to hide the password.  Thanksp

Negative 520 pIm writing a script to process a wave file in Python and display a spectrum analyzer, just for nice visualization of audio files. After some reading of the doc and forums I assumed I needed to use rfft. p  pIm processing samples of 2048 values, creating 1024 bands in output of rfft. The thing is that for my needs I would need to reduce the number of bands dramatically to 12 bands 1 octave. Since Im processing audio files and have a limited number of bands I wonder if there is a smart way to group frequencies so that 90 of songs look nice with lowpitched beats  on the very left and highpitched voicesshoutsnotes on the very right.p  pWith this preliminary code below I have more bands that what I need but also most peaks are concentrated in low frenquencies with most songs, except a test range from 20 to 20k.

Negative 520 pThe app Im working on has a credit response object with a Boolean approved field.  Im trying to log out this value in Objective C, but since there is no format specifier for Booleans, I have to resort to the followingp  precodeNSLogs, [response approved]  TRUE  FALSE codepre  pWhile its not possible, I would prefer to do something like the followingp  precodeNSLogb, [response approved] codepre  p...where b is the format specifier for a boolean value.p  pAfter doing some research, it seems the unanimous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6752082isthereaformatspecifierthatworkswithbooleanvaluesconsensusa is that neither C nor ObjectiveC has the equivalent of a b specifier, and most devs end up rolling their own something like option 1 above.p  pObviously Dennis Ritchie amp Co. knew what they were doing when they wrote C, and I doubt this missing format specifier was an accident.  Im curious to know the rationale behind this decision, so I can explain it to my team who are also curious.  p  pstrongEDITstrong Some answers below have suggested it might be a localization issue, i.e. TRUE and FALSE are too Englishspecific.  But wouldnt this be a dilemma that all languages face i.e. not just C and ObjectiveC Java and Ruby, among others, are able to implement True and False boolean values. Not sure why the authors of these langs didnt similarly punt on this choice.p  pIn addition, if localization were the problem, I would expect it to affect other facets of the language as well. Take protected keywords, for instance. C uses English keywords like include, define, return, void, etc., and these keywords are arguably more difficult for nonEnglish speakers to parse than keywords like true or false. p

I can freely change the height but the width is uncontrollable, and the handles on the buttons dont resize it either.p  pthis is what it looks likep  pa hrefhttps27.postimg.org9z50orlblCantChangeButton.png relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimageb1f77b44vap  precode    ltTextView             androidididlblName             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextstringname          androidtextColorcolorfieldtitle  gt      ltEditText         androididideditName         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent          androidpadding3dip         androidtextColorcolorfield gt          ltrequestFocus androidlayoutwidthmatchparent gt      ltEditTextgt      ltTextView         androidididlblDesc         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextstringdescription         androidtextColorcolorfieldtitle  gt      ltEditText         androididideditDesc         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheight80dp         androidinputTypetextMultiLine         androidmaxWidth180dp         androidpadding3dp         androidsingleLinefalse         androidtextColorcolorfield gt      ltTableLayout         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidstretchColumns1 gt          ltTableRow             androidididtableRow1             androidlayoutwidth50dp             androidlayoutheight500dp gt              ltTextView                 androidididlblStatus                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextstringstatus                 androidtextColorcolorfieldtitle gt              ltButton                 androidididStatusChangeButton                 androidlayoutwidth30dp                 androidlayoutheightfillparent                 androidbackgrounddrawableButtonTest                 androidmaxWidth50dip                 androidtextstringchange                 androidtextColorcolorbuttontext                 androidwidth40dp gt          ltTableRowgt          ltTableRow             androidididtableRow3             androidlayoutwidth50dp             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt              ltTextView                 androidididlblduedate                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextstringduedate                 androidtextColorcolorfieldtitle gt         ltTableRowgt          ltTableRow             androidididtableRow5             androidbaselineAlignedtrue gt              ltButton                 androidididbtnCancel                 androidlayoutwidthfillcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextstringcancel                 androidtextColorcolorbuttontext gt              ltButton                 androidididbtnSave                 androidlayoutwidth60dp                 androidlayoutheight50dp                  androidtextstringsave                 androidtextColorcolorbuttontext gt          ltTableRowgt     ltTableLayoutgt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 520 h2Problemh2  pI am modelling stress tests in JMeter 2.13. My idea of it is to stop the test after certain response time cap is reached, which I test with Duration Assertion node. p  pI do not want, however, to stop the test execution after first such fail  it could be a single event in otherwise stable situation. I would like the execution to fail after strongnstrong such assertion errors, so I can be relatively sure the system got stressed and the average response should be around what I defined as a cap, which is where I want to stop the whole thing. p  h2What I triedh2  pI am using Stepping Thread Group from JMeter plugins. There I could use a checkbox to stop the test after an error, but it does that on first occasion. I found no other node in documentation that could model it, so Im guessing theres a workaround Im not seeing right now.p

Negative 520 pI have a simple WPF app with 3 textboxes, 2 of the text boxes input numbers and the third textbox shows the sum of inputs when another button is clicked.p  pI come from WinForms and MFC background and for me, the intuitive thing to do is to right click the textBoxes, open their properties and specify local variables to read the data from the boxes. For example, MFC has the DDX mechanism for this.p  pHowever, in WPF, the only way to specify a binding seems to add XAML code directly to App.XAML, as shown a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms752347vvs.110.aspxcreatingabinding relnofollowhere on MSDNa.

Negative 520 pOk so I am developing a website in rails right now. Basically it is a static site but I am using rails because eventually my client wants blog and post functionality added in, which has a bunch of different sections with different articles in each section. Each article is designed with its own html structure, some have tables, divs, font coloring, etc. so storing these articles as text in the database doesnt make sense. However, it also didnt seem to make sense to have an entirely separate html file for each article in each section when theyr parent element is going to have the same common structure what I mean by this, is each section on the site, like about, or publications, are going to have theyre own unique layout, however, every article belonging to a given section will be placed in the same div as their sister articles. p  pSo I had an idea. I thought I would use partials for rendering unique content in the same layout for each section. keep in mind that nothing is currently stored in a database. So I am thinking of setting the site up to have different view folders for the sections, and, inside each of those view folders I will have another folder titled content, in which I will put the specific html for a given route. p  pFor example, one of my about routes looks like this p  precode    get aboutpagename, to aboutshow codepre  pWhich sends the parameter pagename over to the controller for the show method, at which point I capture that parameter into a variable in the aboutcontroller.rb filep  precode    def show       content  params[pagename].downcase     end codepre  pAnd then the show.html.erb view renders a partial with the same name as the content variable.p  precode    ltdivgtlt render partial aboutcontentcontent gtltdivgt codepre  pAt this point, the view looks inside the content folder for the specific partial it is called with, and renders that html.p  pMy question is.... Is this unconventional I am pretty sure I know the answer to that question... which is yes. So my follow up question is how bad is it Are there any huge websiteshattering problems this will cause that I cant forsee with my limited rails experience Is there a much simpler, much more conventional method to displaying the content that I have overlooked p

If anyone can help me how to do this, without changing arguments of definitions as def mergesortself and show me how to recursively call it, I would appreciate it a lot. Thank you beforehand.  Also for making linked lists in halfs i should use function divideself but if you know any other way let me know p

Negative 520 pIm using opengl to draw the graphics for simple game like space invaders. So far I have it rendering moving meteorites and a gif file quite nicely. I get the basics. But I just cant get the framebuffer working properly which I indent to render bitmap font to.p  pThe first function will be called inside the render function only when the score changes, This will produce a texture containing the score characters. The second function will draw the texture containing the bitmap font characters to the screen every time the render function is called. I thought this would be a more efficient way to draw the score. Right now Im just trying to get it drawing a square using the frameBuffer, but it seems that the coordinates range from 1 to 0.

Negative 520 pI want to implement a checkpoint system for a game I am working on and for that I need to copy all mutable objects within a level in order to create an independent copy of the level. In a simplified example my classes look something like thisp  precodepublic class GameObject      ...     private Level level     ...   public class Level      ...     private ListltGameObjectgt gameObjects     ...  codepre  pBut there is a problem When I want to duplicate a level and its objects the references become inconsistent. For example, I could deepcopy my Levelinstance and deepcopy all gameObjects. But when I do that, the Levelreference in GameObject is no longer pointing at the right new level. In this case I could just call a method for each object and reset its level. But that would get increasingly complex with more and more types of objects involded, as objects might or might not have their own sets of objects they created and then those references have to be updated as well and so on. p  pIs there anything like a designpattern for this kind of situation, or anything Javaspecific that makes this problem much easier  p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI just had an idea How about creating some kind of wrapper class for each GameObject that looks like this p  precodepublic class GameObjectWrapper      ...     private long gameObjectID     private Level level     ...  codepre  pThis would be given as a reference to all objects which need references. And each GameObject would get a unique id and level would have a map linking each id to an actual GameObject something like codeGameObject Level.getObjectlong idcode. While this would probably work, I still feel like there must be a better solution.p  pstrongEdit Further clarificationstrongp  pIt seems like I did not make my issue clear enough, so I will simplify and generalize it a bit more p  pI got two example objects codeobjectAcode and codeobjectBcode codeobjectAcode contains a reference to codeobjectBcode and codeobjectBcode contains a reference to codeobjectAcode. p  pSomething like thisp  precodepublic class MyObject     private MyObject partner     ...     public MyObject shallowCopy             return new MyObjectpartner      codepre  pI want to copy both. With shallow copy, I get two new objects codenewObjectAcode and codenewObjectBcode. codenewObjectAcodes stored reference which is supposed to point to codenewObjectBcode, however, still points to the original codeobjectBcode and viceversa.p  precodeMyObject objectA  new MyObject, objectB  new MyObject  objectA.setPartnerobjectB objectB.setPartnerobjectA  MyObject newObjectA  objectA.copy newObjectAs partner now is objectB instead of newObjectB MyObject newObjectB  objectB.copy newObjectBs partner now is objectA instead of newObjectA codepre  pNow, I emcouldem just run through all my objects and map their old objects to new objects, but that seems slow and too complicated a solution to me. What is the simplest and most efficient way to resolve this p  pemNote I considered posting this to gamedev.stackexchange.com, but I found this to be more of a programming and design specific problem than a game development specific problem.emp

For each line, it would store the name and address in separate variables.

Negative 520 pi have a situation i cant seem to get around . i must say im quite new to access and sql, so maybe this is quite easyp  pLets use this table as an examplep  precodeCountry  State  City   Value    A        X      1       30    A        X      2       40    A        Y      3       50 codepre  pAnd then, in another tablep  precodeCountry  State  City   Value    A        X      1           A        X      4           A        Z      5        codepre  pI need a query joining both tables to return the  on the second tablep  pWhen the combination citystatecountry is found it should return that record standard join between the tables.p  pWhen the join does not exist e.g. a left join would leave the Value column blank to use the average value from the parent , so the first line would be 30, the second line would be 4030235 and the third one would be 3040503  40.p  pIts like doing three consecutive JOINS first, you are joining country,city,state,and returning AVGValue. Then when AVGVALUENULL, for those records you join country,city, and then if its still not found, you join country only.p  psorry i think i didnt express myself very well, hope you can understand p  pIs there any way to do it quicklyp  pThanksp
Negative 520 pHtmlready event not firing on Android 5.0.2 on Samsung Tabletp  pI have a Sencha Touch and Cordova application that has been written for Android and iOS tablets.  However, the application does not seem to trigger the htmlready event on a Samsung tablet with Android 5.0.2.p  pThe reason why I found this was because the tap stopped working on some of my buttons in the app.  Initially I thought that maybe the tap event had changed, however, they are still firing the same in the samsung tablet with Android 5.0.2 and I have seen this using GapDebug so I know that the touch events are definitely firing.p  pThen, I found that all instances where I am registering event handlers on the htmlready event of the panels were not being registered anymore. After putting some debugging alerts and testing whether the htmlready event was fired on an older version of android 4.4.2 on A Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Ed, which it was, that is how I found htmlready not working.p  pI have done ALOT of investigation and debugging I am struggling with how to now register these event handlers. p  pFrom what I have read about Sencha, this would normally be done in the view or the controller config.p  pIn this case, I have done it in the controller config, because the view is not being fully created by using sencha config, but by pulling in existing html.p  pAny suggestions and assistance at this point would be welcome like.  is there an alternative to htmlready  how else could I register these handlers when using an imported html viewp  pIn my app I am usingp  ul liSencha Cmd v4.0.1.45li liNode.js  v0.10.33li liJRE  v1.7.071li liCordova  v3.4.1li liAnt  v1.9.4li liSencha Touch v2.3.1li ul  pI have included sections of the code that I felt are relevant to the issue.

For instance, in the Cordova examplep  precode    function gotFileWriterwriter      writer.onwriteend  functionevt          console.logcontents of file now some sample text         writer.truncate11           writer.onwriteend  functionevt              console.logcontents of file now some sample             writer.seek4             writer.write different text             writer.onwriteend  functionevt                 console.logcontents of file now some different text                                writer.writesome sample text  codepre  pAll that ends up showing in the file is  different text rather than some different text.  Similarly, the Telerik example should append the input to the existing file each time write is clicked, but it overwrites the existing data completely.p  pThis partp  precodefileEntry.createWriterfunctionfileWriter                                  var len  fileWriter.length                                 fileWriter.seeklen                                 fileWriter.writetext  n                                 var message  Wrote   text                                 onSuccess.callthat, message                             , codepre  pshould use the seek function to append.  I tested, and it does see the previous entrys length in the len variable, but it oerwrites it nonetheless.  I even checked to make sure that len is a number with typeof, and sure enough it is a number not a string.p  pIm not sure what to do next.  Has anyone else bumped into this issue  Is there more information I can providep  pTo be clear, Im literally copypasting the two examples above into Intel XDK and building them at this point so I can stay out of my own way , and theyre both still overwriting rather than appending.p

Negative 520 pI use Scheduled Tasks in my plesk panel with this line  OVH server with Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS and Plesk version 12.0.18p  precodewget O  httpexample.comapplicationlite.phpmoduleultimatenewsampnametask codepre  pbut I have notified by this error p  blockquote   pHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable   ERROR 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable.p blockquote  pHow I can have more details of this error  you have an idea where the problem may come p
Negative 520 pWe have a setup where we are hosting two servers on our backend that we want to mirror each other. This is working well and has been for quite some time. p  pNow on our apache server we want to set it up so if someone goes to oururl.comwp itll send them to either backend1 or backend2, both of which have our WP install hosted in varwww so just hitting a hrefhttpbackend1 relnofollowhttpbackend1a would bring up the wordpress site. p  pThe apache server was set up a long time ago by someone who is no longer on our team. It looks like it has mod proxy, and mod proxy cluster installed along with all the requirements for them. I thought that I could utilize modproxycluster to cluster the two servers and direct all traffic from oururl.comwp to that cluster. Here is the code I used for thatp  precode    ProxyPass wp balancerwpcluster     ltProxy balancerwpclustergt             BalancerMember httpbackend1             BalancerMember httpbackend2     ltProxygt     ProxyPassReverse wp balancerwpcluster codepre  pHowever this just gives me a 503 and an error about all workers being in an error state.p  precodeproxy CLUSTER balancerwpcluster. All workers are in error state codepre  pDoing some reading the onlt thing I can come up with is articles about making modcluster work with jboss. Does modcluster only work for jboss servers p  pIs there any way to do a loadbalancer for two regular wordpress installs running off port 80p
