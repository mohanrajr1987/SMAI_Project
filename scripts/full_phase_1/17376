Positive 17376 pI was recently told that its not a good idea to build a whole web application on Django admin system. While it took just a few lines of code to get a lot of CRUD functionality with no code depending on the models, I heard that I cannot easily open the interface to nonstaff users and limit their capabilities for example which models they see.p  pThis means that I would either have to fork Django admin module or create my application from scratch and Im trying to find out which solution would be simpler. Is there any CRUD framework with authentication built around Django that solves my problem with least code possiblep

Negative 17376 pTo give some background on my issuep  pI have 3 tables called Products, Packages, and PackageContents.  I can go in my application and add products, and then I can create packages out of them.  One of the steps of setting up a package is to create all the package contents.

Then the user can select a dropdown for each one to indicate if the product is in the package, or not.p  pHeres my issuep  pThis renders a separate form for every product, each with its own save button.

Negative 17376 pWe have a Data Access service in our SOA WCF system. This service is responsible for doing CRUD create, update, delete operations on system wide database tables, and is also the source of this data for queries. Any other service in the system wanting to access the tables under the contol of the DAS have to go to the DAS to get it or modify it. We use Entity Framework and built our own POCO state tracking system for this DAS.p  pWe have other tables in our database that belong to single services and store data only for their own use, ie state information they can access if they crash and resume or recording of business information. We have a rule any one table cannot be accessed by more than one service so data needed by multiple services ends up in the DAS.p  pTruth is I have never really understood why a Data Access Service is a good idea as opposed to just accessing tables directly. It seems to be to be slower, our DAS is not transactional as it cannot send back a POCO graph for database update only single POCOS at a time and we have issues also where the DAS is actually a client to another service which needs data from it...circular dependancy.p  pWhy bother with a DAS Why is a DAS so important when it comes to SOA What am I missing here Single point of controlp  pIs it also an SOA design flaw that not all tables are part of a DAS and that some services have their own private tablesp  pAny discussion about this welcome.p

Negative 17376 pOkay, so Ive written a rather unoptimized program before to encode images to JPEGs, however, now I am working with MPEG2 transport streams and the H.264 encoded video within them.  Before I dive into programming all of this, I am curious what the fastest way to deal with the actual file is.p  pCurrently I am filemapping the .mts file into memory to work on it, although I am not sure if it would be faster to for example read 100 MB of the file into memory in chunks and deal with it that way.p  pThese files require a lot of bitshifting and such to read flags, so I am wondering that when I reference some of the memory if it is faster to read 4 bytes at once as an integer or 1 byte as a character.  I thought I read somewhere that x86 processors are optimized to a 4byte granularity, but Im not sure if this is true...p  pThanksp

Negative 17376 pIm using Visio 2007 to create an ER diagram for an SQL server database. Ive used The reverse engineer function to import the data from SQL server to Visio.

Negative 17376 pIm a little confused as to the proper usage of VBOs in an OpenGL program.p  pI want to create a terrain paging algorithm, using a map called from a 4096x4096 greyscale heightmap as the whole map.p  pFrom what Ive read, each vertex stored in the VBO will take up 64 bytes.p  pThe problem I have is that most sources state that a single VBO should be between 14mb in size, and less VBOs is better. Yet according to my calculations, storing each vertex would take a total of about a gigabyte of data 4096x4096x64 Thats not including that each vertice may need to be stored multiple times for each triangle. p  pNor does this accommodate the different vehicles and people that would be on this map once I get the terrain portion of the code worked out.p  pthe other solution I looked at was to page the data from the hard drive while the program is running, but another source says its a bad idea to create and destroy while the programs running, and that its also best practice to have as few VBOs as possible.p  pWhat I really want to know is, what am I missing  Im sure Im making some kind of massive oversight here, because a maximum VBO size of 4mb just seems extremely low, even if I was loading the texture in 64x64 blocks, and the different interactive objects that would populate the map too.p  pOr are my expectations of what I can achieve just unrealistic Is there a better method available to me that Im unaware of Im looking at games like Oblivion or Fallout 3, and to some extend Boundless Planet, and seeing massive terrains, and wondering how on earth that can be possible.p  pI understand how to code, this isnt my first delve into OpenGL, but is my first time attempting to understand and utilize VBOs.p  pIf anyone can shed some light into where my understanding of VBOs is going wrong, it would be much appreciated.p

Negative 17376 pSimilar questions have been asked before but after a day of going through the answers Im still very confused. p  pIm using Microsofts Sync Framework with SQL2008 on the server and SQL CE on Windows Mobile devices. I would have thought this was a VERY common requirement. I dont want to replicate large tables onto the mobile device. I only want the records that are needed. For example, each user will need their jobs out of the jobs table. They dont need any other users jobs. So I need something like where jobId  3 for one device and where jobId4 for another etc.p  pThis looked promising a hrefhttpjtabadero.spaces.live.comblogcnsBF49A449953D05911203.entry relnofollowhttpjtabadero.spaces.live.comblogcnsBF49A449953D05911203.entryap  pbut unfortunately it doesnt work with my code. This code from the sample seems to be trying to get the code that contains the SQLp  precodevar remoteProvider  LocalDataCache1ServerSyncProvidersyncAgent.RemoteProvider   var selectIncrementalInsertsCommand  remoteProvider.SalesLTCustomerSyncAdapter.SelectIncrementalInsertsCommand  codepre  pBUT the code containing the SQL generated by VS is on the serverside and only a proxy is available in the clientside code. This is how the proxy is addedp  precode The WCF Service var webSvcProxy  new MicronetCacheSyncService   The Remote Server Provider Proxy var serverProvider  new ServerSyncProviderProxywebSvcProxy   The Sync Agent var syncAgent  new MicronetCacheSyncAgent syncAgent.RemoteProvider  serverProvider codepre  pSo how can I get to the serverside code that contains the sql from the clientside Sorry Im not explaining this very well but I guess its unlikely anyone will have an answer. The short version is does anyone know a SIMPLE way to limit the records that are synced to a mobile device is this type of app I think the example was meant for desktop apps.p  pIt looks to me like this sync framework is another one of Microsofts halfbaked releases that is really just a beta. Its starting to remind me of some previous horrible experiences with Entity Framework 1.0 p  pCheers Markp

Negative 17376 pI have program that uses shared memory and protects it with semaphore to communicate with other instances of the same program. I am concerned about security of my shared memory and semaphores.p  ol lipHow can I ensure that semaphore and shm that I use wont be opened by other program that will mess it up  There is one way of running the program under separate user with his own usergroup and protecting shared objects with restricting them to be accessible only by that user and group. Is that the answer to my question, or are there some pitfalls, maybe on windowspli lipIs there some way to protect them if I have to run all programs under same user, or if some programs are run as root there are always such programs, arent theypli lipI started up with setting a default key for shm amp semaphore for all the instances that want to communicate together. But there could be different program that has taken the key already. Is there some technique to solve such problem I was thinking about selecting a range of keys ie. key would be integer in range 1000  2000 where if program is unable to acquire key of default value it tries to get other key from the range.pli ol  pI found related question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1128368detectingandcontrollingunauthorizedsharedmemoryreadsherea, but it does not say anything about my questions 2 and 3. Other than that question I cant find anything related to shm and semaphore conflicts and protection, seems like it is not taken much into account when writing programs.p  pMy situation is that I have a program that wants to communicate with other instances of the same program. There are run multiple sets of instances of the same program, where programs of one set communicate together, and programs in other set communicate together. They communicate through semaphore protected shared memory. Program is run on various nix platforms and on windows too. They should be up and running 247 for few years and should be reliable and safe, thats the reason Im concerned about the conflicts.p

Negative 17376 pI have a high performance system well I think, but not yet there 100  written entirely in C and I think I have made some big architectural mistakes while designing. The reason is that it is not easily scalable.p  pThough it currently works pretty well, I want to make sure it is horizontally scalable for the increase of volumes which I expect might happen after a few months.p  pThis system has a high number of concurrent connections of data coming into the system which will get into the database eventually after processing. We currently get about 300 recordsconnections per minute.p  pThe system is architected like this.p  ol liThe whole system is hosted on a win 2003 server 8 GB RAM4 vCPU infra in amazonli liC Socket server which gets the data and puts into a MSMQli liA processor for data and insert to sql server 2008 database table. One of the main table has about 3 GB data even after clearing of periodical data. This has the right indexes and currently reports are reasonably faster enough even to a remote location.li liThis processed data is then posted to MQ which is then processed for rules which will generate certain alertsli liThere are some other associated programs apart from the aboveli ol  pNow the main worry is about scalability of the processor in Step 3 and scalability of Sql server 2008. As the size of concurrent connections increase along with the sql server data, it will make my life tougher.p  pI have come up with 2 alternatives. One of them is a major replacement of backend processors considering the fact that the current system in entirely built on Microsoft technologies.p  pFor all the options, for the main largest table use a postgresqlpgpool III load balancedstream replicated solution for storage. The other tables amp schema will still remain in sql 2008. This gives me a cost effective solution of database storage.p  pOption 1  Replace MSMQ with JBOSS amp HornetQ  Put the data processor in step 3 to a container managed message driven bean in JBOSS ejb container which will give me options for load balancing and clustering.br  This option will need me to move major part of my solution to unixlinux am considering fedorap  pOption 2  Replace MSMQ with Queues of ActiveMQ Clustered and load balanced  Write a Java app which will handle the queue messages and take care of database persistence.br This option will allow me to increase the number of linux servers with the activemq cluster instance and a new instance of the java app.p  pOption 3  Replace MSMQ with Queues of ActiveMQ Clustered and load balanced  Use just the current data processor with some small changes to push data to postgresql  This option will force me to remain with Windows p  pPlease note that the system is a realtime system. It is enough if the system is 99 fault proof. This is not a trading system, so I can afford for a little amount of data loss. p  pDont know if I have explained what I want clearly. But I welcome any questions, as they will definitely help me explain it much better.p  pPlease give your valuable suggestions in making the right choice for a long term solution. I am actually against option 3 myself, but dont want to make a mistake again by leaving it out of the list. p  pMuthup  pAdded for clarificationp  pApologies for not being clear.  1. The question is actually about scalability of the architecture. Especially horizontal scalability. 2. The current average load is about 300 per minute and this may not exactly be spread inside a single minute.  3. The load might scale to 10 times more easily in the next 812 months. p  pThe problem is we were selling about 50 devices in a month and now the sales team is ramping up too fast. I believe this might double soon.p  pSql server had about 8 GB of data and we restricted the amount of storage per device and this has helped in reducing the size. Currently the biggest table is partitioned as 1 partition per 200 device and the queries are reasonable. But I can see a bottleneck on the Sql side with the scalability.p  pSo even if the Sql server is put on another server, there is going to be a limit to the amount of simultaneous updates I can do on sql server. I cant see a horizontal scalability option with load balancing for Sql server though it supports a High availability option with clustering. did I misunderstand MS Sql in load balancingp

Negative 17376 pI work at a gaming cybercafe, and weve got a system here smartlaunch which keeps track of game licenses. Ive written a program which interfaces with this system actually, with its backend MySQL database. The program is meant to be run on a client PC and 1 query the database to select an unused license from the pool available, then 2 mark this license as in use by the client PC.p  pThe problem is, Ive got a concurrency bug. The program is meant to be launched simultaneously on multiple machines, and when this happens, some machines often try and acquire the same license. I think that this is because steps 1 and 2 are not synchronised, i.e. one program determines that license 5 is available and selects it, but before it can mark 5 as in use another copy of the program on another PC tries to grab that same license.p  pIve tried to solve this problem by using transactions and table locking, but it doesnt seem to make any difference  Am I doing this right Here follows the code in questionp  precode    public LicenseKey Acquire throws SmartLaunchException, SQLException      Connection conn  SmartLaunchDB.getConnection     int PCID  SmartLaunchDB.getCurrentPCID      conn.createStatement.executeLOCK TABLE licensekeys WRITE      String sql  SELECT  FROM licensekeys WHERE InUseByPC  0 AND LicenseSetupID   ORDER BY ID DESC LIMIT 1     PreparedStatement statement  conn.prepareStatementsql     statement.setInt1, this.id     ResultSet results  statement.executeQuery      if results.next          int licenseID  results.getIntID         sql  UPDATE licensekeys SET InUseByPC   WHERE ID           statement  conn.prepareStatementsql         statement.setInt1, PCID         statement.setInt2, licenseID         statement.executeUpdate         statement.close         conn.commit         conn.createStatement.executeUNLOCK TABLES         return new LicenseKeyresults.getIntID, this, results.getStringLicenseKey, results.getIntLicenseKeyType      else          throw new SmartLaunchExceptionAll licenses of type   this.name  are in use       codepre

Negative 17376 pWe recently upgraded a Silverlight 4 app that was using RIA Services and EF 4.0 with EDMXs to RIA Services SP1 and EF 4.1 using POCOs. The upgrade was well worth while, but it appears that RIA is now playing differently with how it exposes Associated Entities on the Client.p  pFor example say we have the following EF POCOs which are also our RIA Entitiesp  precodepublic class Building     public Building          Rooms  new ListltRoomgt         [Key]    public int BuildingID  get set      public string Name get set     [AssociationBuilding1Rooms, BuildingID, BuildingID]    [Include]    [Composition]    public ICollectionltRoomgt Rooms get set    public class Room     [Key]    public int RoomID  get set      [Required]    public int BuildingID  get set      public string Name get set     [AssociationBuilding1Rooms, BuildingID, BuildingID, IsForeignKey true]    [Include]    public Building Building get set     [AssociationRoom1Desks, RoomID, RoomID]    [Include]    [Composition]    public ICollectionltDeskgt Desks  get set    public class Desk     [Key]    public int DeskID  get set      [Required]    public int RoomID  get set      public string Name  get set      [AssociationRoom1Desks, RoomID, RoomID, IsForeignKey  true]    [Include]    public Room Room  get set    codepre  pBuilding is the parent of Room and Room is the parent of Desk. The codeAssociationcode attribute defines these relationships for RIA. We then expose these Entities with a simple service that has CRUD for all three entitiesp  precodepublic class BuildingDomainService    var context new BuildingEFContext Lets just say this is our EF Context that has all three types on it   public IQueryableltBuildingsgt GetBuildings         return context.Buildings.Includex gt x.Rooms.Selecty gt y.Desks     public IQueryableltRoomsgt GetRooms         return context.Rooms.Includex gt x.Desks     public IQueryableltDeskgt GetDesks         return context.Desks     Empty Update and Insert Methods to allow editing on client  public void UpdateBuildingBuilding building  public void InsertBuildingBuilding building  public void DeleteBuildingBuilding building   public void UpdateRoomRoom room  public void InsertRoomRoom room  public void DeleteRoomRoom room   public void UpdateDeskDesk desk  public void InsertDesk Desk desk  public void DeleteDesk Desk desk   codepre  pOn the client the BuildingDomainContext that is generated from the BuildingDomainService has the three Exposed Methods GetBuildingsQuery, GetRoomsQuery, and GetDesksQuery, but only a single EntitySet of type Building, the service does not expose an EntitySet for Room or Desk. p  pIn some places in our client app we want to maintain this object Hierarchy, but in others we may only want to get a slice of it, For example if we want to get look at and edit Desks in a Room, but dont care about Rooms in a Building. Because RIA Services does not expose an EntitySet for Room or Desk we cannot edit either of these without also pulling the parent Building.p  pIs there anyway to maintain these associations in RIA, but also allow for editing a part of this hierarchy, without having to pull in the topmost parentp

Negative 17376 pOk this is my scenario. I have a tour that has many stops. I need to keep each stop in order and allow my users to move those stops around. I cant figure out the best way or the best practice to keep a list of items in order. One idea I had was to create a column called position that would keep track of what position each stop was in, however when using jQuery UI sortable it seemed like it expected me to implement the ordered list by sending the ids via ajax to my server in the order they should be. This, is fine, however I dont know how my server is supposed to keep track of which order each stop should be in based on the order of the ids sent in. p  pSo basically, what is the best way to a list of items in orderp

Negative 17376 pI am recreating a small app in WPF and I am trying to use MVVM where it makes sense. I started out thinking I would use it 100 of the time, and so far I have, but Ive come to the conclusion that strict MVVM no codebehind whatsoever is not necessarily a positive thing. p  pNow I am trying to make a user control that will bind to a list and create a regular button for every item in the list. Essentially Im recreating a listbox but with a different style. I am making this user control specifically to avoid creating the buttons on the fly in the main windows codebehind, but I am thinking that since everything is essentially view, and all logic will be done elsewhere, I can just add the buttons in the code behind without technically breaking MVVM. Is this line of thinking correct, deeply flawed or somewhere in between Thanks for any helpp

Once it gets a hold on this window handle, it then gets a list of all IWebBrowser2 windows that are up and running in the users desktop and tries to match the .MainWindowHandle of the process with one if any of the window handles stemming from the IWebBrowser2 collection.p  pThe most significant problem with this approach is that IWebBrowser2.HWND property needed to compare against .MainWindowHandle can be strongverystrong problematic, erratic and temperamental in the sense that it throws InvalidCastException every other time when you try to access it at least on the machines that I am running tests on. Then again theres the overhead of such an operation.p  pHeres my question to anyone who might be more knowledgeable that I am in windows programming Since the HWNDs are gonna match anyways why dont we use the .MainWindowHandle value to retrieve the needed IWebBrowser2 right off the bat see the commented out code above by using the following method inspired by the code WatiN itself uses inside ShellWindow2.csp  precode    private static IWebBrowser2 GetIWebBrowser2DirectlyIntPtr embeddedWebBrowserWindowHandle              IHTMLDocument2 document2  UtilityClass.TryFuncIgnoreException gt IEUtils.IEDOMFromhWndembeddedWebBrowserWindowHandle         if document2  null return null          IHTMLWindow2 parentWindow  UtilityClass.TryFuncIgnoreException gt document2.parentWindow         if parentWindow  null return null          return UtilityClass.TryFuncIgnoreException gt ShellWindows2.RetrieveIWebBrowser2FromIHtmlWindw2InstanceparentWindow      codepre  pas a sidenote, we can even make a proxy object, described in another post of mine, to cache the window handle so as to avoid asking IWebBrowser2.HWND for it.p  pThis works for me just fine. I cannot see any conflict or mismatch between HWNDs  dunno if theres a corner case I might be missing out on. I am tempted to ask in WatiN forums about this but I thought to ask here at Programmers Central first just in case I am missing something obvious.p  pThank you all in advance. Any tip appreciated.p  pCheers, Dominickp

Negative 17376 pIve recently been working on Project Euler problems in Python. I am fairly new to Python, and still somewhat new as a programmer. p  pIn any case, Ive ran into a speedrelated issue coding a solution for problem 5. The problem is,p  p2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20p  pIve checked around some, and I havent been able to find anything on this problem pertaining to Python specifically. There were some completed scripts, but I want to avoid looking at others code in full, if possible, instead wanting to improve my own. p  pThe code I have written runs successfully for the example of 2520 and the range 1 to 10, and should be directly modifiable to work with the question. However, upon running it, I do not get an answer. Presumably, it is a very high number, and the code is not fast enough. Printing the current number being checked seems to support this, reaching several million without getting an answer.p  pThe code, in its current implementation is as followsp  precoderangemax  20 def divcheckn     for i in xrange11,rangemax1         if n  i  0             continue         else             return False     return True  if name  main    num  2    while not divchecknum        print num        num  2    print num codepre  pI have already made a couple changes which I think should help the speed. For one, for a number to be divisible by all numbers 1 to 20, it must be even, as only even numbers are divisible by 2. Hence, I can increment by 2 instead of 1. Also, although I didnt think of it myself, I found someone point out that a number divisible by 11 to 20 is divisible by 1 to 10. Havent checked that one, but it seems reasonablep  pThe code still, however is not fast enough. What optimisations, either programmatic, or mathematics, can I make to make this code run faster p  pThanks in advance to any who can help.p

Negative 17376 pIve found a ton of solutions online for clearing default text out of a field when the field is focused on, then replacing it if the user exits the field without entering anything. The one I finally went with was this solution from Electric Toolbox httpwww.electrictoolbox.comjquerychangedefaultvalueonfocusp  precode.defaultvalue.eachfunction  var defaultvalue  this.value this.focusfunction      ifthis.value  defaultvalue          this.value         this.blurfunction      ifthis.value            this.value  defaultvalue        codepre  pThis works just fine every text input field of class defaultvalue switches to a blank field when focused on. When I leave the field, either the default value returns if nothing was entered, or if something was entered, that data stays in the field. So far so good.p  pTheres a catch here however the data in the default of the field is being written to the database when the user submits the form. Since not all of our fields are required, we have several which a user may not choose to fill out. This means we have a final data list with a lot of people with an address of John Sample, Street Address, Address 2, City State Zip.p  pWhat I would love is to be able to tell the form not to submit fields if the information in them matches the default. I dont know javascript  Im just cobbling together code that I can find  so Im sure I have the syntax wrong, but ideally this would be something likep  precodeonsubmit if address1  Street Address then address1   codepre  pIs there any reasonably clean and simple way to do this Also, if you could explain it like youre talking to someone who recently suffered a traumatic brain injury, that would be good too.p

I have a working Spring Application with GWT and Spring Security, but when I change the securitycontext around to use CAS authentication, I do get redirected to the cas page usually, but after successful login, I get redirected to the correct url, but I get a page not found error at the browser level. After refreshing the page same url, Im logged in, and application loads as expected. No errors in the logs, as far as I can tell, no differences in whats happening in the application when using CAS vs normal spring security form login. p

Negative 17376 pIm getting very frustrated and Im hoping someone here can help. I have a maps app where there are several markers on the maps with infoWindows whose content updates regularly. My solution has been to place the divs that will go into the infoWindow in the DOM in a hidden container that can be updated by my updater code in the background. Then I use a single infoWindow and just set the content to the DOM element using queryp  precodegoogle.maps.event.addListenermarker, click, function      infoWindow.setContentidwindowcontent[0]      infoWindow.openmap, marker  codepre  pThe thing works great... once. Then it wont open again for that maker. I have noticed that if I open the window on one marker Marker A, and then close it, and then open it on another maker Marker B, and then go back to the Marker A, the window will appear beside Marker A, but with Marker Bs content.p  pWhy wont my script set the content to the DOM element a second time...

Negative 17376 pThe estimatedvalue attribute of the opportunity entity is marked as being required.

Negative 17376 pI hope to be the clearest I can. Lets say I have a dataset with 10 variables, where 4 of them represent for me a certain phenomenon that I call Y. The other 6 represent for me another phenomenon that I call X.p  pEach one of those variables 10 contains 37 units. Those units are just the respondents of my analysis a survey. Since all the questions are based on a Likert scale, they are qualitative variables. The scale is from 0 to 7 for all of them, but there are 1 and 2 values where the answer is missing. Hence the scale goes actually from 2 to 7.p  pWhat I want to do is to calculate the regression between my Y which contains 4 variables in this case and 37 answers for each variable and my X which contains 6 variables instead and the same number of respondents. I know that for qualitative analyses I should use Anova instead of the regression, although I have read somewhere that it is even possible to make the regression.p  pUntil now I have tried to act this wayp  precodegt applyY, 1, functionY meanY[Ygt0] calculate the average per rows respondents without considering the negative values  gt Y.reglt capplyY, 1, functionY meanY[Ygt0] create the vector Y, thus it results like 1 variable with 37 numbers  gt applyX, 1, functionX meanX[Xgt0]  gt X.reglt capplyX, 1, functionX meanX[Xgt0] create the vector X, thus it results like 1 variable with 37 numbers  gt reg1lt lmY.reg X.reg make the first regression gt summaryreg1 see the results Call lmformula  Y.reg  X.reg  Residuals      Min         1Q       Median      3Q       Max  2.26183 0.49434 0.02658  0.37260  2.08899   Coefficients                Estimate  Std.

Negative 17376 pI am new to android dev, and I have been trying for a few hours now to add nice and smooth rounded corners to an ImageView, without success.p  pFirst thing I tried is simply to round corners of my images directly, but this implies changing the bitmap, and since I need to keep the raw ones, and those are pretty big, this is not really memory friendly. This would also cause other difficulties since my ImageView is fluid.p  pSecond thing I tried to use is the clipPath method after subclassing my view. This works, but corners are aliased. I then tried adding a PaintFlagsDrawFilter to implement the aliasing, but this didnt worked. Im using monodroid, and I was wondering this was supposed to work in Java.p  pHere is my code C p  precodepublic class MyImageView  ImageView      private float[] roundedCorner             Contains the rounded  corners for the view.

Negative 17376 pIm trying to create an implementation of a LinkedList that represents polynomials. The Linked list is going to be a list of Terms. A term is an implementation of Data which is an abstract class with methods compareTo and toString. The Polynomial class has a variable called head which I am trying to initialize as a Term.

Negative 17376 pIm trying to create a site that has a parallax type effect with scrollTo navigation control.p  pSimilar to a hrefhttpwww.nike.comjumpman23aj2012 relnofollowhttpwww.nike.comjumpman23aj2012a however I only need to scroll on left and right up amp down. I can do horizontal and vertical parallax, and scrollTo I  just cant get the diagonal parallax working with mouse scrollp  pIve currently got it working using scrollTo however this disables the user being able to scroll with the mouse.

Negative 17376 pFor a numerical routine implemented in C I need to read data from files ascii. The data is needed as input for the numerical computation and will in general be too large to fit it into the memory. Hence I need to prefetch it dynamically to some array to feed it into the routine otherwise reading the file will be the botlenck in the computation. Is there an establishedsimple way to do this using stdlib, maybe posix threads or MPI I am working with intels MPI library under Linux.p  pThe routine codefunccodein the following pseudocode represents the numerical core routine. It is called very frequently, say by a solver for ordinary differential equations. Each time codeicode it is called with a random float value of codex[i1]ltx[i]ltx[i1]Dcode with known value of codeDcode. So there is some early information about codexcode which allows me to know approximately which data values from the file are needed in the next step.p  precodereadfilex,data      code to search xdependent data in file     data[i]...   funcx      readfilex,ampdata      several data and xdependent operations     result ...    return result   codepre  pWhile the block code  several data and xdependent operations code and some external code is executed I can in principle prefetch the data needed in the next call of codefunccode from the file into a buffer array in parallel. On the next call I can search the information in the array instead of the file. I ask for the code needed to prefetch the data in parallel and the replacement for readfile the part which communicates to the file reader which data will be needed in the next step. Ideally, if the code  several data and xdependent operations code block needs about as much time as searching the file later would not take any extra time. If the code stays at it is the execution time will be about twice as long neglecting the time needed for external opperations. Note that, if the block takes more time than the read, I can easily parallelize it. Something I cannot do with the present reader.p

Negative 17376 pI use nginx on Debian.

Furthermore it would be great to have a possibility to extend the template, so that I can add new settings to my vhosts and redefine the settings inherited from the template.emp  pemHow can I achieve itemp  hr  pMy current vhost file structure looks like thisp  petcnginxsitesavailable contains following filesp  blockquote   pdefault default vhost axcommonvhost vhost template   test.sandbox.loc vhost based on the template axcommonvhost it   includes thatwith the codeincludecode rule ...and some further ones...p blockquote  petcnginxsitesavailable contains following filesp  blockquote   pdefault  etcnginxsitesavailabledefault test.sandbox.loc    etcnginxsitesavailabletest.sandbox.loc ...and some further   ones...p blockquote  pThe template axcommonvhost defines some options like root folder dynamically, using the server namep  precodeserver      listen   80     servername ltprojectgt..ltareagt..loc      if host  ltprojectgt..ltareagt..loc          set folder areaproject          ...     accesslog varlognginxareaproject.access.log     errorlog varlognginxerror.log     ...     root varwwwfolder     ...  codepre  pSo when I want to create a new vhost, I just create a new vhost file and a link to it  and dont need to copyamppaste the settings and to set the paths manually. I just need to follow the convention, that a host project.area.loc hast to be placed in [my webroot]areaprojectp  pI thought, it works over the include rule The server gets a request x.y.loc, looks for a file named so, openes the file, and finally processes the directives in it so the include directive and the the whole content of the included template.p  pBut its not so. Nginx seems just to scan the whole folder etcnginxsitesavailable alphabetically and to hold on the first file  codeservercode directive the host name in the request equalsmaches to.p  pThat means, the includep  precodeinclude etcnginxsitesavailableaxcommonvhost codepre  pis not used.

Instead of this it just loops the etcnginxsitesavailable folder, finds axcommonvhost, myzf.sandbox.loc maches to the pattern ....loc, and nginx uses axcommonvhost for myzf.sandbox.loc.p  pHow can this problem be solvedp  pThanksp

Negative 17376 pI am writing a toy kernel for learning purposes, and I am having a bit of trouble with it.

Negative 17376 pI am trying to write a function that determines if a number emnem is prime or composite using the Lucas pseudoprime test at the moment, I am working with the standard test, but once I get that working I will then write the strong test. I am reading the a hrefhttpmpqs.free.frLucasPseudoprimes.pdf relnofollowpapera by Baillie and Wagstaff, and following the a hrefhttpwww.trnicely.netmiscbpsw.html relnofollowimplementationa by Thomas Nicely in the a hrefhttpwww.trnicely.netmisctrn.zip relnofollowtrn.ca file.p  pI understand that the full test involves several steps trial division by small primes, checking that emnem is not a square, performing a strong pseudoprimality test to base 2, then finally the Lucas pseudoprime test. I can handle all the other pieces, but I am having trouble with the Lucas pseudoprime test. Here is my implementation, in Pythonp  precodedef gcda, b     while b  0         a, b  b, a  b     return a  def jacobia, m     a  a  m t  1     while a  0         while a  2  0             a  a  2             if m  8  3 or m  8  5                 t  1  t         a, m  m, a  swap a and m         if a  4  3 and m  4  3             t  1  t         a  a  m     if m  1         return t     return 0  def isLucasPrimen     dAbs, sign, d  5, 1, 5     while 1         if 1 lt gcdd, n gt n             return False         if jacobid, n  1             break         dAbs, sign  dAbs  2, sign  1         d  dAbs  sign     p, q  1, 1  d  4     print p, q, d , p, q, d     u, v, u2, v2, q, q2  0, 2, 1, p, q, 2  q     bits  []     t  n  1  2     while t gt 0         bits.appendt  2         t  t  2     h  1     while 1  lenbits lt h         print u, u2, v, v2, q, q2, bits, bits[h]  ,                u, u2, v, v2, q, q2, bits, bits[h]         u2  u2  v2  n         v2  v2  v2  q2  n         if bits[h]  1             u  u2  v  u  v2             u  u if u  2  0 else u  n             u  u  2  n             v  v2  v  u2  u  d             v  v if v  2  0 else v  n             v  v  2  n         if 1  lenbits lt h             q  q  q  n             q2  q  q         h  h  1     return u  0 codepre  pWhen I run this, codeisLucasPrimecode returns codeFalsecode for such primes as 83 and 89, which is incorrect. It also returns codeFalsecode for the composite 111, which is correct. And it returns codeFalsecode for the composite 323, which I know is a Lucas pseudoprime for which codeisLucasPrimecode should return codeTruecode. In fact, codeisLucasPseudoprimecode returns codeFalsecode for every emnem on which I have tested it.p  pI have several questionsp  p1 Im not expert with CGMP, but it seems to me that Nicely runs through the bits of coden12code from righttoleft least significant to most significant where other authors run through the bits lefttoright. My code shown above runs through the bits lefttoright, but I have also tried running through the bits righttoleft, with the same result. Which order is correctp  p2 It looks odd to me that Nicely only updates the emuem and emvem variables for a 1bit. Is this correct I expected to update all four of the Lucaschain variables each time through the loop, since the indexes of the chain increase at each step.p  p3 What have I done wrongp

Negative 17376 pWhat I want to accomplish is to allow my users to change the overall color theme of my application by selecting a master color from a list. I have got this working but there was something that I noticed that could possibly make my life easier if I can figure out how to do it. Right now I have a Theme folder that looks like this. Theme folder that holds other folders and generic resource dictionaries used accross the boardi.e. brushes used for backgrounds. The next set of folders down are the RedTheme, BlueTheme folders each of which contain resource dictionaries for individual controls for example BlueTheme has a resource dictionary for buttons and so does RedTheme. The interesting thing Ive noticed is that the resource dictionaries are almost identical with the exception of the color of just one SolidColorBrush. So Im trying to bind that brush somehow so that I dont wind up having copies upon copies of the same resource dictionaries with just one difference. I will do my best to put in my code, but the nature of it is complicated enough without actually being able to see the different dictionaries. Also I should add that I am nesting dictionaries within nested dictionaries. App.xaml contains whatever dictionary, that contains multiple dictionaries itself, is swapped in or out for theme change AND some generic dictionaries. p  pstrongThemeBlue.xamlstrong p

Negative 17376 pAll sw is Windows based, coded in Delphi.p  pSome guys submit some data, which I send by TCP to a database server running MySql. p  pSome other guys add a passfail to their data and update the database.p  pAnd a third group are just looking at reports.p  pNow, the first group can see a history of what they submitted. When the second group adds passfail, I would like to update their history. My options seem to be  p  ol liblindly refresh the history regularly in Delphi, I display on a DB grid so I would close then open the query, but this seems inefficient.li liask the database server regularly if anything changed in the last X minutes.li linever poll the database server, instead letting it inform the users app when something changes.li ol  p1 seems inefficient. 2 seems better. 3 reduces TCP traffic, but that isnt much. Anyway, just a few bytes for each 2. However, it has the disadvantage that both sides are now both TCP client and server.p  pSimilarly, if a member of the third group is viewing a report and a member of either of the first two groups updates data, I wish to reflect this in the report. What it the best way to do thisp  pI guess there are two things to consider. Most importantly, reduce network traffic and, less important, make my code simpler.p  pI am sure this is a very common pattern, but I am new to this kind of thing, so would welcome advice. Thanks in advance.p  hr  p[Update] Close voters, I have googled amp cant find an answer. I am hoping for the beneft of your experience. Can you help me reword this to be acceptable or maybe give a UTL which will help me Thanksp
Negative 17376 pIm on people tracking in computer vision. I have observations blob as output of blob detection after background subtraction and i want to infer the objects that have produced this observations.p  pI have troubled with some kalman filter code. And its quite clear to me, but my problem is multi object tracking my problem is that sometimes the observations are incompletenoisy. Lets explain me better. In a test with clear observations i have 1 blob for each person. Kalman filter can help me in smoothing the noisy path of the person into a smoothed curve. But this is not my problem. The problem is that sometimes blob detection is not perfect and I have 2 blobs for 1 person for example if the person i want to track is dressing a tshirt of the same color of the background or sometimes I have 1 blob for 2 persons for example if the 2 persons are hugging themself or are too near each other.p  pI have searched some theory and I have found a tons of papers that are solving the problem of object tracking with particle filter. So I studied a lot on bayesian filter, monte carlo method, importance sampling and it is a little bit clear I dont have math knowledge on probability to understand everything but the idea is clear.p  pAnyway I dont still understand how particle filter can help me in detecting cases where 2 blobs correspond to 1 object or 1 blob correspond to 2 objects.p  pCan someone help in understanding this problemp

What would be fasterp  precodea.att1 codepre  por p  precodea.att1 codepre  pIm under the impression that by doing codea.att1code python would first look in the objects dictionary, or slots as in the example I am working with. If that isnt located there when it looks for functions as is in the case with the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2referencedatamodel.htmlobject.getattr relnofollowcodegetattrcodea. When doing a lot of computations in my class definition I rather access something located in the dictionary or in the slots as opposed to the ones I defined with the decorators. Is this considered bad practice among the python community Im only asking this since the default configuration of codepylintcode tells me otherwise and I would like to continue working having good standards in mind.p  h2EDITh2  pLet us try not to get into the discussion of codeslotscode and premature optimization. If possible assume that in my original post I did not use codeslotscode and that everything is in the objects dictionary. p

Negative 17376 pI have a FreeSwtich solution running on Linux with quite a lot of configuration scripts written in javascript.p  pThe problem is that we need to write and read files which javascript normally doesnt support. I tried the SpiderMonkey File Object but it doesnt work and has been marked as obsolete..p  pThe setup is a bit special there is really only one dial plan with one javascript handling the call initially. Depending on a number of parameters the call is then handed over to one of 20 or so Javascripts dynamically included. It is actually a data base lookup that returns the name of the script to run.p  pSo looking for other options if there are any Rewriting the entire thing in LUA is an option of course but to keep the current structure that would mean rewriting a lot of javascripts. Unless someone can think of a magic way to call LUA script from javascriptp

Negative 17376 pI am trying to create an flash light application which contains strobe function. I have successfully achieved flash light onoff effect but I am running into trouble with strobe effect. Whenever I try to create the strobe effect the application crashes. If I remove that, it works fine.p  pI have one activity with a codeseekbarcode at the top and the onoff switch at the center. What I want to achieve is that if the user clicks onoff button the flash light should toggle onoff if the codeseekbarcode at the top is at 0. If the user increase the value in codeseekbarcode the flash light should start to strobe accordingly and if the user move the value back to 0 flashlight should remain constant.

Negative 17376 pI use this code to Highlight the vertex I click and its child by changing opacity. It only works however for the next child connected to the vertex I select. How could I do the same thing, clicking a vertex, but highlight also all the vertices connected to its child and the ones that lead to the cicked vertex.

Negative 17376 pIm having the same problem as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13413036googledriveapiphpclientlibrarysettinguploadtypetoresumableuploadthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13808528uploadlargefiletogoogledrivewithphpclientlibrarylq1thisa but in the Java domain. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15499334howtospecifyuploadtypeforinsertfunctioningoogledrivesdkjavaclientThisa question also covers what I want but since no answers have been forthcoming I thought Id ask it here, with a little more detail.p  pIm most of the way through writing a Java application to back up files to Google Drive. As others have found, internal server error 500 failures are a pretty common problem with uploads, but for small files, implementing the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdrivemanageuploadsexpbackoff relnofollowrecommended exponential backoff and retrya works okay. For large files, however, anything over a few MB the failure rate is unacceptably high. In some cases Im getting well over 50 failure rate, which makes any long backup job effectively impossible.p  pWhen inserting uploading a file using the Google Drive v2 API, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdrivemanageuploads relnofollowthe documentation clearly statesa that three upload types are available simple, multipart and resumable. The upload type is specified by adding a parameter to the endpoint URL. Clearly, what Im after is the resumable upload type.p  h2The problemh2  pThere appears to be no method to set this uploadType parameter using the API. Theres a method call to set every optional parameter as detailed a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdrivev2referencefilesinsert relnofollowherea, but not a sniff of a way to set uploadType to resumable. No code snippets, no documentation, no nothing.p  pSomewhat confusingly, there is also what appears to be an unrelated chunked media upload mode, which is the default and which Ive actually disabled in my application by calling coderequest.getMediaHttpUploader.setDirectUploadEnabledtruecode, since it appears to make no difference whatsoever to the reliability of an upload, no matter what the chunksize is set to, and it hugely slows uploads down.p  pIm on the verge of circumventing the API and building the requests manually, but Id really like to know if anyone else has encounteredsolved this first. Its such a glaring omission that I cant believe lots of folk havent encountered it before.p  pCheers all.p  pDavid.p
Negative 17376 pI was trying to submit my second app update and it failed submission after passing validation. This is the errorp  pUnable to create configuration directoryApplicationXcode.appContentsiTMSTransportation.woa.itmstransporter. Cannot save local copy of remote diagnostic configurationlocal path is not writable. p  pMy screen shot of the error cannot be attached. I know it is not a network error at Apples end because it specified a path in the Application Loader in Xcode. Since the system has read and write permissions here, it cannot be because I changed something. I submitted another app successfully earlier on the same day without a problem as usual. I am at my wits end. Anyone experienced this p  pSince there is no Build for Archiving in Xcode 5 like in Xcode, I started with following steps 1  From the Xcode Product menu I selected Archive item 2  After the Build, the organizer window appeared in the foreground with my archive in it. 3   I clicked the Validate button and it executed that  successfully. 4  When I clicked the Distribute button, it started uploading the app but failed and came back with the aforementioned error. I went to the folder to see if any folder in the directory path is locked and also to see who has read and write permissions. It is not me but the system. I did a Disk Permission Repair in Disk Utility but that didnt help. p  pI then removed the offending file .itmstransporter. and tried to submit but got a different error. I put it back and took out the other two ITMSTransporter.cmd and WOBootstrap.jar but produced a different error. So I restored the folder to its original contents and returned to where I started  stymied. I have considered installing a new version of Xcode 5.0 but I dont know if that will help.

Negative 17376 pI have created a very simple UI using codeQtcode which consists of a simple button and a label.

However, while this appears to work to a degree, what actually happens is that the video capture stream from my webcam a strongLogitech Quickcam Pro 9000strong repeatedly opens and closes.

Negative 17376 pI am currently working on a python project to enable the detection and interpretation of key events as charactersnames across platforms. I have been working with pythonxlib to provide support on X11 but I have recently run into difficulty in the process of converting the keycodes of key events to their appropriate keysyms.p  pA snapshot of my code is here a hrefhttpsgist.github.comSavinaRoja7306962 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comSavinaRoja7306962ap  pThe trouble arises specifically in the use of the PyKeyboardEvent class, where I am capable of retrieving the event data for key events, but not interpreting their keycodes to keysyms. Xlib.displays keycodetokeysym function does not work appropriately.p  pIn reading about X11, and confirmed by the xev utility source code, it seems that the appropriate Xlib function to utilize is XLookupString. Were I coding in C a language I am only beginning to learn using this function would be simple, however I am currently stumped with regards to employing the function from python. I have considered two options I may attempt to utilize and extend pythonxlibs protocol to call XLookupString, or I might try to use ctypes to call XLookupString. My code includes an attempt at the latter not functional, but shows where I am at currentlyp  precodefrom ctypes import  XLookupString  cdll.LoadLibrarylibX11.so.XLookupString  charbuffer  createstringbuffer257 keysym  cint   the important value count  XLookupStringbyrefevent,   TypeError, not a ctypes instance                       byrefcharbuffer,                       lencharbuffer,                       keysym,                       None codepre  pI suspect that what I am missing is the ability to convert the event class from pythonxlib to an appropriate C struct for XLookupString, or the ability to interpret the data received from the X server which pythonxlib parses into the event instance into such a struct. Am I correct in this suspicion If so, what tools do I need to learnp  pAt this point I am probably missing a lot of basic information and skill regarding the interface between python and C, so I devoting time to fixing this gap in my general education. If anyone has insight in to my problem specifically or how I should conduct my research on relevant topics, I would love to hear it.p

Negative 17376 pAs I get further into building my ASP.Net MVC website, I am encountering some hardcoding that I want to refactor into something a little be more flexible.p  pIn my views, I have been passing a MenuItemModel that looks like thisp  precodepublic class MenuItemModel      public MenuItemModelstring aLinkName, string aArea                               , string aController, string aAction       public string LinkName  get private set      public string Area  get private set      public string Controller  get private set      public string Action  get private set       public bool isActive  get set   codepre  pSo that in the view, I can create a link with thisp  precodeHtml.ActionLink Model.LinkName , Model.Action              , Model.Controller , new  Area  Model.Area  , new    codepre  pThis means that I have to create a bunch of MenuItemModels like thisp  precodeMenuItemModel MIMnew MenuItemModelHistory,Transactions,History,Index codepre  pThis works fine, it creates the right links.  p  pBut I see a big problem looming in the future .. this strategy isnt resilient to refactoring abilities in Resharper.  I want the luxury of refectoring my Area Names, Controller Names and even the Action names in the future as we add new features.  By hard coding the literal Transactions for the area name, I must now manually refactor the entire website to find all the Transactions literals and replace them with something else if we change the area name or break a area into smaller areas, etc.  Yuck.p  pIs there a way to get the controller name, area and action name from if I were to instantiate a link to the ActionResult  Is there a Helper out there I dont know aboutp  pOne way is to usep  precodemyController.GetType codepre  pAnd inspect the type attributes and parse out the Area and Controller name from the FullName in the Type, but I dont have that luxury with the method ... it returns type information for the ActionResult and has no identifying names.p  pThoughtsp

I went through the code a few times but I cant find out where my code is trying to access restricted memory space or if there is any other problem causing the seg fault Im not even sure what seg fault is.p  pIm not sure if Im allowed to paste the whole code over here. So, Im putting this up on pastebin  a hrefhttppastebin.comM0mTU8Jg relnofollowhttppastebin.comM0mTU8Jgap  pAnother question In my code at line 13, if I replace  codestrcat,infixcode with codeinfix[strleninfix]code, I get this warning codewarning assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast [enabled by default]code. What is the cause of this warning Similar statements later in the program do not raise any warnings for example in line no. 24p  pstrongEDITstrong The seg fault was because I had used wrong order of arguments in the strcat function so it was trying to append string to a constant that is a read only memory.p  pNevermind the second question, I was assigning a string char  to a char so the warning. Just needed to replace double quotes with single quotes.p

Implement at least two different solutions to find Nth largest element with ONlogN average time complexity in BigO notation, where N is the number of elements in the list.p  pAccording to my understanding i can use Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick sort on the provided integer list with duplicates to find the Nth largest element with ONlogN average time complexity in BigO notation. Is that correct  p  pAlso, what about duplicates in the list do i just add an extra line of code in the above mentioned algorithm to remove duplicates will that not affect the ONlogN average time complexity because Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick sort will only sort the list not delete duplicates. p  pI am not looking for any code but just tips and ideas about how to proceed with the question  I am using Java  also is there any predefined classedmethods in java that i can use to accomplish the task rather than me coding Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick sort on my own.p  pMy aim is to complete the task keeping in mind ONlogN average time complexity. p

Is there any way to eliminate this error After this error occurs then when the app tries again immediately to communicate with the server, then the same error occurs.

Negative 17376 pIve got a system that uses Akka 2.2.4 which creates a bunch of local actors and sets them as the routees of a Broadcast Router.  Each worker handles some segment of the total work, according to some hash range we pass it.  It works great.p  pNow, Ive got to cluster this application for failover.  Based on the requirement that only one worker per hash range existbe triggered on the cluster, it seems to me that setting up each one as a ClusterSingletonManager would make sense..however Im having trouble getting it working.  The actor system starts up, it creates the ClusterSingletonManager, it adds the path in the code cited below to a Broadcast Router, but it never instantiates my actual worker actor to handle my messages for some reason.

Is this possible and how can I modify this code to support thatp  pMainActivityp  precodepackage com.td.flickrsearch  import java.util.ArrayList  import android.animation.Animator import android.animation.AnimatorListenerAdapter import android.animation.AnimatorSet import android.animation.ObjectAnimator import android.app.ActionBar import android.app.ActionBar.Tab import android.app.ActionBar.TabListener  import android.app.ProgressDialog import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.graphics.Point import android.graphics.Rect import android.os.Bundle import android.os.Handler import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity import android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction import android.view.KeyEvent import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuInflater import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.View.OnClickListener import android.view.ViewGroup import android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams import android.view.ViewTreeObserver import android.view.animation.DecelerateInterpolator import android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo import android.widget.AbsListView import android.widget.AdapterView import android.widget.AdapterView.OnItemClickListener import android.widget.BaseAdapter import android.widget.Button import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.GridView import android.widget.ImageView import android.widget.ProgressBar import android.widget.RelativeLayout import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast   import com.td.flickrsearch.entity.FlickrPhoto import com.td.flickrsearch.image.ImageCache.ImageCacheParams import com.td.flickrsearch.image.ImageFetcher   public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity implements OnClickListener, TabListener       private int mImageThumbSize     private int mImageThumbSpacing     private ImageFetcher mImageFetcher      public static int currentPage  1     private boolean endOfAlbums  false     private int lastItem  0      private TextView tvNoAlbums     private ProgressBar progressLoadMore      GridView albumGrid     ImageAdapter imageAdapter     ArrayListltFlickrPhotogt feed  new ArrayListltFlickrPhotogt     ProgressDialog progressDialog      private Handler myHandler  new Handler     private Runnable updateRunnable      EditText etSearch     Button btnSearch      private Animator mCurrentAnimator     private int mShortAnimationDuration      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.listfragment               Set up the action bar.         final ActionBar actionBar  getActionBar         actionBar.setNavigationModeActionBar.NAVIGATIONMODETABS           For each of the sections in the app, add a tab to the action bar.         actionBar.addTabactionBar.newTab.setTextFriends.setTabListenerthis         actionBar.addTabactionBar.newTab.setTextChat.setTabListenerthis         actionBar.addTabactionBar.newTab.setTextMe.setTabListenerthis         actionBar.addTabactionBar.newTab.setTextUsers.setTabListenerthis         actionBar.addTabactionBar.newTab.setTextR.string.titlesection3.setTabListenerthis              Set the Animation time form the android defaults         mShortAnimationDuration  getResources.getIntegerandroid.R.integer.configshortAnimTime                    progressDialog  new ProgressDialogthis         progressDialog.setMessageFetching images, please wait...         progressDialog.setCancelablefalse                              etSearch  EditText findViewByIdR.id.etSearch         btnSearch  Button findViewByIdR.id.btnSearch         btnSearch.setOnClickListenerthis                    mImageThumbSize  getResources.getDimensionPixelSizeR.dimen.photothumbnailsize         mImageThumbSpacing  getResources.getDimensionPixelSizeR.dimen.photothumbnailspacing                   ImageCacheParams cacheParams  new ImageCacheParamsthis, Util.IMAGECACHEDIR           The ImageFetcher takes care of loading images into our ImageView          children asynchronously         mImageFetcher  new ImageFetcherthis, mImageThumbSize         mImageFetcher.setLoadingImageR.drawable.emptyphoto         mImageFetcher.addImageCachethis.getSupportFragmentManager, cacheParams                    progressLoadMore  ProgressBar findViewByIdR.id.progress         progressLoadMore.setVisibilityView.GONE          S          imageAdapter  new ImageAdapter         albumGrid  GridView findViewByIdR.id.photoGrid         tvNoAlbums  TextView findViewByIdR.id.tvNoAlbums          albumGrid.setAdapterimageAdapter         albumGrid.setFastScrollEnabledtrue           This listener is used to get the final width of the GridView and then          calculate the          number of columns and the width of each column.

Negative 17376 pstrongFinal Editstrong Im making one last edit to this question for clarity sake.  I believe it has been answered in all of the comments, but in the event there is such an option, I think its best to clean up the question for future readers.p  pI recently inherited someones Perl code and theres an interesting setup and Im wondering if it can be made more efficient.  p  pThe program is setup to use codestrictcode and codewarningscode as it should.  The program is setup to use codeglobalcode variables meaning the variables are declared and initialized to codeundefcode at the top of the program.  Specific values beyond the initial codeundefcode are then assigned to the variables throughout various loops within the program.  After they are set, there is a separate report section after all internal loops and subroutines have run that uses the variables for its content.  p  pThere are quite a few variables and it seems repetitive to just make an initial variable declaration at the top of the program so that it is available later for outputreport purposes and to stay compliant with the strict pragma.  Based on my understanding and from all of the comments received thus far, it seems this is the only way to do it, as lexically scoped variables by definition only persist in during their declared scope. So, in order to make it codeglobalcode it needs to be declared early i.e. at the top.p  pIm just wondering if there is a shortcut to elevate the scope of a variable to be global regardless of where its declared, and still stay within codestrictscode parameters of course  p  pMy previous example was confusing, so Ill write a pseudo code example here to convey the concept I dont have the original source with mep  precode Initial declaration to create Global variables  imagine about 30 or so my var1, var2, var3  Global   Imagine a foreach loop going through a hash and assigning values   to previously declared variables for my k keys h   ...   var  1 var gets set to 1 within the foreach loop   ...  print The final calculated report is as followsn  output var after loop is done later in program print Variable 1 comes to var1n  codepre  pSo the question is there an acceptable shortcut that declares codevar1code within the codeforeachcode loop above and escalates its scope beyond the codeforeachcode loop, so it is in effect Global This would avoid the need to declare and initialize it to codeundefcode at the top of the program and still make it available for use in the programs output.p  pBased on feedback already received the answer seems to be an emphatic No due to the defined scoping constraints.p

Negative 17376 pAfter looking around at a lot of related questions and trying just about everything, I am posting my own in an attempt to get a satisfactory response. p  pI my app start out at the base ViewController, which then uses a modal segue from a button created in storyboard to transition to the GameScene ViewController, which then presents the game scene. When the game is over, I programatically create the button to navigate back to the base ViewController from the GameScene. When this button is pressed, the following code attempts to segue back to the base ViewControllerp  precodeUIViewController vc  self.view.window.rootViewController [vc performSegueWithIdentifierBackToStartScreenSegue sendernil] codepre  pThe segue it is calling has been created by controldragging from the GameSceneViewController to the base ViewController and selecting modal as the segue type. This creates an odd figure8 pattern where each viewcontroller has a modal segue pointing to the other. I suspect this is not optimal. p  pI have a feeling that I should be using an unwind segue, but I am not sure. I attempted to add a button to the GameSceneViewController storyboard, and then enable it once the game is over, but I was not able to control whether or not it was enabled through my Scene, but I may not have done it right. p  pThe exact error message is as follows emem Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason Receiver  has no segue with identifier BackToStartScreenSeguep  pI have also checked and double checked that Ive gotten the spelling right on the segue identifier, as well as deleted the app from the simulator and testing device, as well as cleaned and built again with this. p

The SettingsEntities is a DbContext Entity Framework  Model first.p  pBut, I when accessing the repository through the unit of work, I still receive the error messagep  pThe operation cannot be completed because the DbContext has been disposed.p  pI dont know whats going on here since Im using the PerRequestLifetimeManager.p  pThe error is happening in the constructor chaining of the UnitOfWork. Probably because Im constructor a new UnitOfSettings rather than resolving it through the dependency injector. Could that be the cause, and is there an elegant way to solve itp

Negative 17376 blockquote   pProblem  Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of   numbers. Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is   odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value   of n, terminating when n  1. The input will consist of a series of   pairs of integers i and j, one pair of integers perline. All integers   will be less than 1,000,000 and greater than 0.    For each pair of   input integers i and j, output i, j in the same order in which they   appeared in the input and then the maximum cycle length for integers   between and including i and j. These three numbers should be separated   by one space, with all three numbers on one line and with one line of   output for each line of input.p blockquote  psample input p  precode1 10 codepre  psample outputp  precode1 10 20 codepre  pso i wrote this  p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  struct lineint in1int in2int result  int cycleint in  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int cycleint in     char c     int firstIn0     struct line l[500]      int pointer0      while2lt3         l[pointer].in10         l[pointer].in20         scanfu u,ampl[pointer].in1,ampl[pointer].in2         ifl[pointer].in1lt1l[pointer].in2lt1             break                   int maxCyc0         int j,m         int min,max         ifl[pointer].in1gtl[pointer].in2             maxl[pointer].in1             minl[pointer].in2                  else             maxl[pointer].in2             minl[pointer].in1                  forjminjltmaxj              m  cyclej             ifmgtmaxCyc                 maxCycm                  l[pointer].resultmaxCyc         printfd d dn,l[pointer].in1,l[pointer].in2,l[pointer].result         pointer        int cycleint in     int cyc  1     whileingt1         ifin20             cyc             inin2                  else             cyc             inin31                   return cyc  codepre  pIts completly ok but when you change codewhileingt1code in cycle method to codewhilein1code it gets much more slower. my question is whyp  blockquote   pTime when its codewhileingt1code  0.683 secp      pand when its codewhilein1code  I waited more than 5 min nothing   happened yet p      pfor input  1 1000000p blockquote  pthere is no infinite loop or something because codeincode cant get below 1 at allfor that it must be already 1 .p  pBest regardsp

Negative 17376 pAt my institution we have a script that has been encrypting and decrypting passwords for about 10 years from a database please, lets not get into the bestpractices of doing that or not its a healthy debate in my own community but the business requires it.  Its been doing that running on Java 1.3 using BouncyCastle.p  pSo, essentially, I have a very old keystore with very old passwords, and I need to use those but in an updated codebase running on an upgraded machine with new Java.p  pWe decided to rewrite the codebase surrounding that functionality, which basically requires rewriting this piece as well.  Basically, though, the encryption part of the code is identical.  Now we are deploying it to Java 1.7 on Redhat.  This is where we ran into problems.p  pMy development machine OSX, Java 1.7 build 8p  pMy test machine Redhat, Java 1.7 build 9p  pThe new code executes just fine on my local development machine. But when I tried to deploy it to our test machine I got UnrecoverableKeyException no match.p  pSo on our test machine I tried to deploy it using Java 1.6  and lo and behold, that works fine.  I then acquired Java 1.7 build 8 thinking build 9 was the issue and tried that, but same error as on build 9.p  pSo it would seem that BouncyCastlep  ol lion an OSX machine it will run on Java 1.7li lion a Redhat machine it wont run on Java 1.7 but does run on Java 1.6 and below.li ol  pMy question is this does anyone know if there is in fact a problem with Java 1.7 and BouncyCastle  I tried looking through the BC website but aside from stating that the latest BC jars are compatible with Java 1.7, the rest of the site seems pretty broken lots of 404s.  I tried googling, but almost everything related to this exception is referencing Android and seems unrelated.p  pOr is there something Im missing about getting it to run on Java 1.7  Im certainly not wellversed in BC, PGP, or anything related to encryption and am mostly winging it to be honest.

I have 2 questionp  ol liWhy codeUnitycode let you choose to split or not I mean, if for example I let codeUnitycode calculate the tangents on a model with an hard edge, doesnt the tangent splitting need to be done by default It doesnt make much sense to me split a vertex because of 2 different normals and keep the calculated tangents the same, but maybe Im missing something.li liIn any case, selecting codesplit tangentcode checkbox shouldeventually increase vertex count, doesnt it even accordingly to this a hrefhttpforum.unity3d.comthreadsimportmodelsettingssplittingtangents.261233 relnofollowposta. But when I enable codesplit tangentscode, the vertex count in the inspector decrease instead. Is it a bug or am I misunderstanding itli ol

Negative 17376 pIm creating some kind of horoscope. I have one fragment with all horoscope signs, so when user click on one horoscope sign, Im sending that sign name to the web service and Im getting JSON with horoscope content for that sign. This content is split in 4 parts daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. For that Im creating 4 tabs and filing with content from JSON. But the problem is when I go back to all horoscope signs, the 4 tabs are still there. I dont want tabs to be shown. So I need somehow to hide that 4 tabs, and show them again when user click on another or the same horoscope sign.

Negative 17376 pOkay, Im dealing with a problem hear. Im building landing pages for my company. The main website works with a .aspx form to retrieve car data from for example licenseplates.p  pNow weve set up some new relevant domain names to use for some of the landing pages. The problem now is, that when on those pages I type in licenseplate and click search, it fails doing so. Since it tries to find the .aspx form on the landing page domain url.p  pFor examplep  pMain site www.mysite.comcategory.aspxk80zbfk refered to when the licenseplate is typed in. Landing page www.mysite2.comcategory.aspxk80zbfk were it refers to on the landing pagep  pNo the second one should refer to the first one. But I cant seem to find a way to do so. I dont have acces to the .aspx files since theyre in control of a external company. Is there any way to fix this To refer the landing page to the .aspx from the main site Or do I have to contact the webcompany to ask for the files so I can copy them to the other domainp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 17376 pPerhaps Im misunderstanding the concept of Kendos MVVM implementation, but...

Negative 17376 pHere is what I am trying to do. I am making a class which contains indexer for accessing fields within the class, and for addingremoving new fields. Basically the class is like a class with set of static and dynamic fields. I am using a dictionary for the indexer. My problem is that how would I find out and update the static object in the dictionary when the user explicitly reinitialized one of the field examplep  precodepublic class foo    public class bar      Dictionaryltstring, foogt dict  new Dictionaryltstring, foogt      public bar               using reflection to initialize all fields           public foo this[string name]              get                      return dict[name]                 public class bar2bar Note defined by the user, cant use getsetter to update it        public foo field1        public foo field2       public foo field3   public static void main      bar2 test  new bar2     test.field1  new foo     test[field1] this points to the old field1. How can I update it automatically when test.field1  new foo is called  codepre  pSome of you might suggest me to use reflection to do it, but what if the user called remove field1 and added a new dynamic field called field1, I would want to return the new one created by the user instead of the one defined in the class. p
Negative 17376 pIm trying to have a method execute every second by using an additional class that codeextends TimerTaskcode.

Not sure. Cant remember. I just want to know if theres an easier way that doesnt require two classes before I tackle this.p  pSorry about the stupid names. I just made them for demo purposes.p

Declaring the array as an optional array means that it will not take up any memory at all, whereas an empty array has at least some memory allocated for it, correct So using the optional array means that there will be at least some memory saving. I guess my first question is Is there really any actual memory saving involved here, or are my assumptions about this incorrectp  pOn the other hand, if it is optional then each time I try to use it I will have to check to see if it is codenilcode or not before adding or removing objects from it. So there will be be some loss of efficiency there but not much, I imagine.p  pI kind of like the optional approach. Not every codePersoncode will have children, so why not let codechildrencode be codenilcode until the codePersoncode decides to settle down and raise a familyp  pAt any rate, I would like to know if there are any other specific advantages or disadvantages to one approach or the other. It is a design question that will come up over and over again.p

Negative 17376 pI want to build some kind of interactive week plan. I use an html table for displaying the plan. Each table row corresponds to one day of the week, while each table cell represents a certain part of the day e.g. morning, noon e.t.c.. The table is rendered in a template partial.

Negative 17376 pThis is a code style and architectural question. And it is not specific only for iOS or Android. What is the best and the most correct way for declaringstoring REST apis endpointsurls in the client app Lets say I have a client app for some social network or whatever rest service. This service has a lot of different api endpoints codeuserlogincode, codeuserprofilecode, codecommonlistcode and so on and so forth. There can be a large number of this endpoints. So the question how should I correctly manage this in my clients app Right now I just declare string constants like this for iOS codestatic NSString  const kLoginUser  userlogincode, Swift codelet loginUser  userlogincode or in Android codeprivate final String LOGINUSER  userlogincode. pBut if the webservice is rather complex there can be 4050 such string constants or more. And I wondered maybe I do it in a wrong way, and there are more elegant ways for managing endpoints in REST clients Any explanations or interesting approaches will be very helpful.p

Negative 17376 pIm trying to display strongALLstrong items added to a column in DataGridView in the first form window into a ComboBox in the second form window. I am using text files and not a database this assignment requires us to use text files only.p  pThe problem I am having, is it only displays the last item added to the DataGridView in the ComboBox, and not all the column items.  For example, if I add 3 rows worth of data and I want to display only the second column with all the items it contains into the ComboBox, there should be 3 items in the ComboBox. But my program only displays the last item that was added to the DataGridView into the ComboBox.p  pHeres my code belowp  precodePrivate Sub BtnAddClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles BtnAdd.Click  Save user entered data to text file and add data to DGV  File.AppendAllTextFilePath, NumText.Text amp  amp CodeText.Text amp  amp ModTitleText.Text amp  amp SemesterText.Text amp  amp vbCrLf     DGV.Rows.AddNumText.Text, CodeText.Text, ModTitleText.Text, SemesterText.Text   If CodeText.Text ltgt Nothing Then   ModulesRegistered.Module1Text.Text  CodeText.Text.ToString amp    amp ModTitleText.Text.ToString     End If  MessageBox.ShowData has been saved, Text codepre  pModulesRegistered is the second form window and the current form windowthe first form window is called RegisterModules.p  pIve also tried using DataBindings, but it didnt work out, as I do not understand how to use it fully.p  pI would appreciate some assistance with this.p
Negative 17376 pIm sure this is easy to do, Im just new to this level of PHP programming. Also, please forgive my terminology, I dont know the official names for things, so let me know if somethings not clear.p  pAlright, so Im building a calendar in PHP, and Ive got everything almost working, except I can only display one event per day. I realized this is because Im storing the event data as subkeys for a specific key in an array.p  pEssentially Im creating each day in the calendar as key in the array. For examplep  precodeevents[1]  first day of the month events[2]  second day of the month events[3]  third day of the month ... codepre  pAnd then inside of each of those, Im doing something like thisp  precodeevents[1][title]  title for the event on the first day of the month events[1][time]   time for the event on the first day of the month events[2][title]  title for the event on the second day of the month events[2][time]   time for the event on the second day of the month ... codepre  pThis setup means I can only store one event per day. If I where to try to set up multiple events, each subsequent event would overwrite the values from the previous.p  pSo what I want to do is set up each event as an array within that key. For examplep  precodeevents[1][0]  arraytitle gt first title for the event on the first day of the month, time gt first time for the event on the first day of the month events[1][1]  arraytitle gt second title for the event on the first day of the month, time gt second time for the event on the first day of the month codepre  pI could use codearraypushcode to add each event, but Im not sure how to do that for an array with keys.p  pFinally, once I have this all stored properly, I need to output each event somehow, so how would I cycle through each subarray of each day Right now Im just doing p  precodeforeach events as event      if event[title]            echo ltstronggt . event[title] . ltstronggt       codepre  pI imagine I would need a codeforeachcode inside the codeforeachcode, but Im not quite sure how to set that up.p  pThanks for the help. Again, Im sure this is simple to figure out, Im just not much of a programmer.p  pPS This is all being built for a WordPress site, if that makes a difference. I know theres a hrefhttpwordpress.stackexchange.comhttpwordpress.stackexchange.coma, but I think because this is more general programming questions than anything specific to WordPress that this it the more appropriate site.p

Negative 17376 pIm developing a mobile app which will perform authenticated calls to web services using tokens after initial username and password validation. The app will keep a local database of usernames and passwords.p  pIf a call is made with an expired or invalid token, the app will automatically attempt to login again with the latest working credentials three times for instance, just to be sure before calling the web service again, otherwise it will show a login screen.p  pIn case the web service call is successful the data will be returned as JSON containing the requested data in a particular format in which attributes are basically named as their corresponding database column names.p  pI intend to generalize this behavior i.e. calling a web service, trying to login three times before launching the login screen, retrieving a successful JSON object or an error in form of a code or an HTTP response code  I believe I have all the possible situations covered regarding errors [] in my app so I can implement a single web service access API or at most two, one separate for the initial authentication.p  pThat way I would just pass the web service URL, HTTP method, request parameters, expected JSON format, and converter algorithm which transforms the JSON object into more friendly Model objects and the same API would work for every WS call.p  pIs this possible with Java 6 without additional librariesp  pOne more difficulty Id like to also provide a fragment instance which will be displayed to the user if the web service request is successful. That fragment would display the requested data, whichever its format is. Im not sure how to glue together the ubiquotous calling API and the fragment.p  pIs this possiblep  p[] em400  bad parameters 401  unauthorized 403  no access to the requested feature 404  not found. In case of a candidate HTTP 500 Server Error Im going to hide away the message from the user by logging it in a database table and returning an error code with HTTP 200. Only if another error occurs e.g. while attempting to record the message then the app will receive an actual HTTP 500.emp

Negative 17376 pI have to do a little exercise at my university but I am already stuck for a while. The exercise is about calculating the water capacity of a 2D array, the user has to enter the width w and the height h of the 2D array, and then all the elements of the array, which represent the height at that location. Really simple examplep  precode10 10 10 10 2 10 10 10 10 codepre  pThe output will then be 8, because that is the maximum water that fits in there. Another example isp  precode 6 4  1 5 1 5 4 3  5 1 5 1 2 4  1 5 1 4 1 5  3 1 3 6 4 1 codepre  pOutput will be 14. p  pWhat also important to mention is The width and height of the array can not be larger than 1000 and the heights of the element cannot be larger than 105.p  pNow I basically have the solution, but it is not fast enough for larger inputs. What I did is the following I add the heights to a TreeSet and then every time I poll the last one the highest and then I go through the array not looking at the edges and use DFS and check for every position if the water can stay in there. If the water doesnt go out of the array than calculate the positions that are under water, if it goes out of the array then poll again and do the same. p  pI also tried looking at the peaks in the array, by going vertically and horizontally. For the example above you get thisp  precode0 5 0 5 4 0 5 0 5 0 0 4 0 5 0 4 0 5 3 1 3 6 4 0 codepre  pWhat I did with this was give the peaks a color let say black and then for all the white colors take the minimum peak value with DFS again and then take that minimum to calculate the water capacity. But this doesnt work, because for examplep  precode7 7 7 7 7 7 4 4 4 7 7 2 3 1 7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7 7 7 7 codepre  pNow 3 is a peak, but the water level is 7 everywhere. So this wont work. p  pBut because my solution is not fast enough, I am looking for a more efficient one.

Negative 17376 pI am working on a consulting gig in which my client got a prototype for his App to work on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite by using a storyboard.

Please let me know if you need any further information.p  pEDIT It seems that I do need to provide more information from the answers Im getting so far. I have two databases in play. A vendor supplied database, for an application which records job, timesheet, employee, customer, etc information. Lets call it DB01. And a database call it DB02 for my application its a mobile app for users to record timesheet or jobnote information, and submit it to DB01.p  pThe mobile app has a user interface which has the following key inputs Start Time, Stop Time, Break Time, Job Selector drop down, Timesheet Title, Timesheet Notes, Send Email To Customer checkbox, To Address, Subject, Body.p  pAs such, a complex type does work correctly and is what im using in the interm. However, because I have another page which will be able to email the customer as well, I wanted a separate email table however, i dont want to have to save the email separately, and then assign it to the timesheet or jobnote.p  pAlso  the only tables i need for DB02, are the ones to store the timesheet, jobnote and email data. Once the timesheet or jobnote gets submitted, it can be deleted or archived. I only need these tables, because all other relevant information is contained in DB01. I can retrieve this data from views on DB02, and i can submit the information from DB02 to DB01 with a stored procedure from DB02. DB02 has DB01 as a linked serverp

Negative 17376 pNeed to setup a server backend webservice and contemplating either some MongoDB solution or other NoSQL and cache concoction. Ive read several articles indicating how Couchbase is so much faster than MongoDB which isnt a slouch itself. Heres for referencep  pa hrefhttpwww.couchbase.compressreleasescouchbasedominatescassandradatastaxandmongodbnewlyreleasednosqlperformancebenchmark relnofollowhttpwww.couchbase.compressreleasescouchbasedominatescassandradatastaxandmongodbnewlyreleasednosqlperformancebenchmarkap  pa hrefhttpprnewswire.comnewsreleasesmongodb30withwiredtigernewbenchmarkmeasuresperformancevscouchbaseserver302300053144.html relnofollowhttpprnewswire.comnewsreleasesmongodb30withwiredtigernewbenchmarkmeasuresperformancevscouchbaseserver302300053144.htmla   p  pSo my question how true is this Has anyone else tested and can confirm such orders of magnitude performance differencep  pIf so, is there a way to improve MongoDB performance by integrating some cache for it I think Couchbase is actually a cache with CouchDB store added, how can MongoDB be usedintegrated in some manner to provide similar performance Why not just use Couchbase if its betterp  pWell, I was concerned by reading many places about its lack of documentation. Then I was alarmed by reading this ...Couchbase forum threads which are habitually abandoned by Couchbase reps when a developer points out a pretty huge flaw in their code, intentionally or unintentionally...p  pa hrefhttpscalabilitysolved.comdontusecouchbaseunlessyoureallyreallywantto relnofollowhttpscalabilitysolved.comdontusecouchbaseunlessyoureallyreallywanttoap  pJust go to the bottom of that article linked above and read the entire comment at the bottom by Erutan. Basically if one goes to Couchbase website it does seem that the company is really pushing their Enterprise version mainly which is fine, but it is worrysome when people think that they might be purposefully not providing documentation and perhaps I misunderstood, but from what I gather from that Couchbase users comments, some think that bugs might be left in the code intentionally to steer people to the enterprise version On the PLUS side, it does seem that all the code is Apache licensed so anyone is free to fix any bugs.p  pAnyway, for me, I was leaning towards MongoDB for various reasons, although performance was one of them, until happened on some couchbase benchmarks. Looking forward to some affirmations or challenges to these couchbase performance superiority claims and possible solutions to bolster MongoDB setup. So is Couchbase way faster than any other nonmemory provenstable NoSqlp

Negative 17376 pIm new to RMI but I should know how to use locks, and frankly I do not quite get the whole RMI thing, Im just not sure what concept Im missing so the code does not get blocked.p  pIts been a while since I did concurrency, but afaik, something like thisp  precodeif condition      write.lock     do something since its inside the critical section     write.unlock  codepre  pAnd so on. And I dont really need it to be a ReentrantReadWriteLocks or whatever, I just need for a method to get a lock and then free it. But I need to free the lock in another method, and this is where I stop understanding what I need to do when its code for rmi methods and clients and servers and all this Im doing.p  pWhat Ive got so farp  precodepublic synchronized void acquire boolean exc throws RemoteException      if exc          write.lock     else          read.lock         exclusivo  exc        public synchronized boolean setFree throws RemoteException      if read.tryLock          read.unlock      else          return false       codepre  pAnd then the client invokes one method to get the lock, makes its operations, and then uses the other method to free it. Obviously this is not finished, and I believe though Im not sure, and thats why Im asking, that the read lock is done about right... But I have trouble believing it, even though Ive tried it and it seems to work, Im not sure if Im missing something else.p  pThats one problem, the other is, I dont really know what to do with the write lock, since if I do write.tryLock, and its free, its going to get the lock, and then Id... free it and return true I guess but by the time the condition is returned, the lock could be used again, since its a write lock Something like that, not surep

Im trying to change the browser from PhantomJS to Firefox with the Firebug extension so I can step through the unit tests and associated code.  Note that this is all on CentOS7.p  pThe way I expect this should work is that I run the tests from the command line, which runs the browser, then runs the tests.  I can then click on the DEBUG button in the Karma display on the web page and then enable Firebug.  I can then visit the files that were loaded by Karma, set a breakpoint, and then reload the page, which I thought would rerun the unit tests so it will hit my breakpoint.p  pMy results with these assumptions are odd, and even varying.p  pIt will be difficult for me to provide all of my source code and a test case that demonstrates my issues.

It puts the yellow arrow on the last line of this file, which Ive marked with insanity.  Pressing Resume at this point just removes the yellow arrow and nothing else happens.

Negative 17376 pIm building an iOS reader app where I need to be able to highlight selections of text and optionally link notes with highlights.   Ive begun by using Text Kit codeUITextViewcode, codeNSAttributedStringcode.  I am targeting iOS 7, 8, and 9.p  pMy strongproblemstrong is that I need to be able to support Drop Caps on certain paragraphs in the content.  This means the first letter of a paragraph is the height of 2 lines of text and the first 2 lines of text appear beside it, then the remaining lines wrap under.  My content has many drop cap characters on various paragraphs throughout.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvxiZX.png altdrop cap example emExample showing 4line drop cap.emp  h2Text Kit Exclusion Pathsh2  pMy initial assumption was that I would use Text Kit exclusion paths so that paragraph would wrap around it.  But I cant figure out a way to determine the exact placement of the exclusion paths and I wasnt sure if these would float along as my content scrolls.  With this approach, I would also have to manually handle text selection of the Drop Cap characters, which Id like to avoid.p  h2Text Kit NSTextAttachmentsh2  pI was hopeful that I could use inline Text Attachments codeNSTextAttachmentcode, but I cant determine a way to have 2 lines wrap beside it.p  h2Core Texth2  pI found a couple older preTextKit examples of Drop Cap implementations using Core Text, however, every one showed only the first character of the content as a Drop Cap and not multiple paragraphs throughout the content as I need.
