Positive 2888 pWe just testing a link which has 100 Mbs bandwidth and 70ms latency between the two site. With plain iperf increasing tcp window size we managed to achieve close to 100 Mbits throughput but over SQL server client we can achive only 3 Mbits due to small tcp window.  Did the same test with NFS copy without any change on tcp window which you cannot change on windows 2012  we achive only 45 Mbits there as well.p  pIs there any way to configure this in .Net and increase the default tcp window size used by the sql connection on windows server 2012p  pAny help would be appreciated to solve this issue.p

Positive 2888 pwe have red hat linux  2.6.32573.1.1.el6.x8664 box on which tomcat 7.0.42 as application server. we have deployed the java application thats sends data to windows service through TCP. After fresh restart of tomcat its works fine but later it stop sending data to windows service port. Each time we restart tomcat it works fine for some time. when windows service tries to read data from java application using tcp socket it reads 0 bytes .[[enter image description here][1]][1] p

Positive 2888 pBasically what i need to do is to get a notification, then proceed to receive the data using the class DataInputStream and the method read.p  pThe problem is that the DataInputStream does not have a method to check if there is something to read and by doing tests with read method would interfere with further calls to read.p  pI can do a hack to make the test by reading one byte and the append further data to it, but i would like to see if there is a more elegant solution.p

Positive 2888 pIve tried everything. No idea whats happening with my program. Ive written a tcp server and a client. I can issue some commands from the client to the server, they are lslocal, lsremote, get filename, put filename i have not yet implemented put, because I am stuck on get.p  pEverything works perfectly until I issue the get command. The server.c and client.c files are in different folders. When you issue get filename where filename is the name of the file you want to get, the server checks if the file exists in its current directory, if it does, it sends it to the client. p  pOn the first iteration, this works perfectly. The file is sent to the client and the client creates a copy of said file. However, ANY command besides lslocal results in pure garbage being printed out to the client terminal and I have no idea why. I think it might have to do with me needing to clear a buffer but I tried that and it still didnt work so Im obviously doing something very wrong. Here is what happens when I issue a command after get file when I issue get filename again, I get a line of garbage and nothing is sent even though the file exists in the server.p  pIf I issue the command lsremote, this is where it goes crazy printing gibberish non stop to my client terminal. p  pIve included both files in case you want to test them to see what I mean. Usage is get filename, no single quotes. Remember, it breaks after the first time, works fine the first.  Sorry for the long files, the sending file code is in the method named sendfile, Ive tried to organize it so its easy to read.p  pNeed some major help on this, thanks in advancep

Positive 2888 pI have some devices attached to the same network. All of them runs a TCP server. I have my PC also connected to the same network. I need to collect data from the other devices. So Im about to write an app in Qt framework which does that. I will exchange small packets with the devices, so I thought I make a generic object for devices which has a QTcpSocket member, and I use signals and slots for receiving data. I have an other class which I use to connect to devices. It inherits QObject and QRunnable. the QRunnabless run method implements the connecting procedure and it looks like thisp  precodeQTcpSocket socket  socket.connectToHostthisgthostAddress, thisgtportNumber  ifsocket.waitForConnected      emit ConnectedthisgtdeviceId, socket.socketDescriptor  else      emit ErrorthisgtdeviceId  codepre  pThis function is run in a separate thread using QThreadPool to avoid long delay due to connecting timep  precodeConnector connector  new ConnectorhostAddress, port, id  connectconnector, ampConnectorConnected, this, ampCommunicationLayerConnected connectconnector, ampConnectorError, this, ampCommunicationLayerError  QThreadPoolglobalInstancegtstartconnector codepre  pAnd when the Connected signal is fired, I instantiate a device object for that specific idp  precodethisgtdevices.pushbacknew Deviceid, socketDescriptor, this  connectthisgtdevices.back, ampDeviceDataReceived, this, ampCommunicationLayerDataReceived codepre  pThe sockets descriptor is passed as an argument and then when the Device object is instantiated, and I call QTcpSocketsetSocketDescriptor on the socket inside the device object with that argument.p  pMy problem is that sometimes I got strange messages QSocketNotifier Invalid socket 7 and type Read, disabling... QSocketNotifier Invalid socket 7 and type Write, disabling...p  pSometimes I dont get anything and it just works, sometimes I get both, sometimes just one of them. I am a bit clueless.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI think I found whats a problem because Im declaring the socket in the run function as an auto variable, it goes out of scope as the function returns, so the socket descriptor is invalid. And because its running in a separate thread sometimes my device is constructed before the function returns and this way the socket descriptor remains valid. I made the socket object in run function a pointer, it works now, but I dont know if it could cause a memory leak. Any ideas If I use a smart pointer to manage the sockets lifetime, I get the same result as before with the auto variablep

Positive 2888 pive seen other people with this problem, but maybe i can explain my situation and you can point out where the issue might be.p  pim getting a Warning  socketbind unable to bind address [98] Address already in use error.p  pthe situation is this. I am using a web application to trigger another program to perform tasks from a webpage interface. The results of that program are sent through a socket to my web application that is listening on a socket.p  pfirst i create and open the socket, then i trigger the other program, then when that program is finished it should send its results back through the socket.p  pit works fine the first try. Then the next try i trigger this process many times i get the above socket bind error when trying to open the socket, obviously the socket is still bound.p  pi wait about a minute and i can successfully run the process again.

I will try to explain what has happened in both applications and ask some questions, correct me if anywhere I made a mistake in my explanationp  pin the client application we first write a byte buffer to the stream that has been established between client and server. The syntax is straightforward and nothings wrong here. Next we read some bytes to the exact same buffer after the server has done some operations on the stream. When we want to read the data, we must do it in a loop to get the data in chunks and then write the bytes received to the byte buffer. The syntax of codeReadcode method is like this the first argument takes the buffer array, the second argument takes the offset, and the third is the maximum of bytes to put into the buffer.p  pSince we want to fill the byte buffer, we should specify the offset the total bytes received to fill THE REST of the buffer array and declare codebyteBuffer.Length  totalBytesRecievedcode as the maximum number of bytes to put into the buffer. No problems here. But the question here isp  ol lipHow does the program know that the server did some operation on the stream and then read the datap  pNow in the server application, I cant understand what is happening with the reading of the data.We read the into the whole buffer array, and write all of it into the stream right after that.pli lipShouldnt we write the data with an offset Would someone explain how this writing and reading is workingpli lipHow do the read and write methods wont conflict with each other since they are operating on the same streamthe same sequence of bytespli lipHow does the program know where to read the next data and where to write the next data into the stream that they dontpli ol
Positive 2888 pI have a strange problem as follows.p  pI am preparing a Device Client with Python 2.7. There are Tracking devices amount 1100 active and running which sends signals to server. They have periodic signal that is sent once every hour. Signal sent frequency is changing according to situation but they must sent at least one emGPS Position Dataem signal once every hourp  pThose devices are running in emlong connection modeem, that means a connection initiated by the device should be alive for 34 hours. For keeping this connection alive,thy sent emHeart Beat Signalsem they are not emGPS position signalsem, but they are signals that contains some data. Heartbeat signal interval is 15 minutes.p  pBelow is my script for listening a TCP portp  precodeclass Serverobject     def initself, host, sockport, buffsize1024         self.hostname  host         self.sockport  sockport         self.buffsize  buffsize         self.socket  None      def startself         self.log.infoListening          self.socket  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM         self.socket.setsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SOREUSEADDR, 1         self.socket.bindself.hostname, self.sockport         self.socket.listen1024          while True             conn, address  self.socket.accept             thread.startnewthreadGV55LiteHandlerconnconn, buffsizeself.buffsize.handledata,  codepre  pThis is the method that is called when Socket server receives a new connectionp  precodeclass GV55LiteHandler     ....      def handledataself         while True             try                 veri  self.conn.recvself.buffsize                 if not veri                      We do not recieve any data...                     raise NoIncomingDataException             except NoIncomingDataException                 break             except Exception as he                 print he                 break             else                 self.controldataveri         self.conn.close codepre  pAfter a while, I check using psutil the number of threads of the process and see the total number of threads are stronggreater than 5.000strong. I evaluate this as some devices have emdeadem connections that looks like still active, but dropped by the device and a new connection is established. Considering the total number, each device looks like created 4 connections, closed them when the emlong connection timeem is over set within the device and established a new connection. That is said to be normal in some situations and have no effect. But after a while, I get reports that some devices could not connect Then I kill the Port listening script and restart it and within 10 minutes, all devices that could not connect and sent data starts to sent data again. Have some research over this but can not find anything about the situation. My best guess is, after a device established too many connections I have a similar tracking device with a different manufacturer which I have 120 active devices and see a total running threads of 1600, which means each devices established and fail to drop 10 previous connection, and then establish a brand new one like the previous ones the server do not accept any new connection from that device, or the device fails to create a new TCP connection to server and GPS data is not sent until script is restarted and all connections are dropped.p  pThese tracking devices are running on single data connection. That means, no device can have 2 active data connections and sent data using both this is meaningless too.p  pI tried to set TCP connection time out to TCP connection as belowp  precodeconn, address  self.socket.accept conn.settimeout10800 codepre  pand handle this in the data processing scriptp  precodetry     veri  self.conn.recvself.buffsize     if not veri          We do not recieve any data...         raise NoIncomingDataException except NoIncomingDataException      No need to log anything in here...     break except sockettimeout     print Socket Timeout     break codepre  pThat seems to work and now I do not have any device that could not sent GPS data. But on the other hand, codeconn.settimeoutcode is not setting the connection timeout properly, and after a while, after 30 seconds of the last signal, the connection is codetimeoutcode by the codeconn.settimeoutcode. I expect it to set the timeout to 3 hours but it fails and the connection is dropped after 20 minutes and a new emHeart Beatem signal is sent to open the new connection, followed by the GPS position signal. GPS signal must be sent once every hour but when codesettimeoutcode is defined, I received that signal once every 20 minutes. p  pI use blocking codesocketcodes the default socket behaviour. Do not try nonblocking sockets and do not have much knowledge of them too.p  pHow can I get rid of inactive connections that causes devices not to sent data without breaking the codelongconnection modecode  of the devices p  pstrongUpdatestrong I never hit codeNoIncomingDataExceptioncode in the codehandledatacode method in both codesettimeoutcode version and notimeout version.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I have emDebian GNULinux 6.0.10em in my server.

Positive 2888 precently I am attempting an exercise that requires to design a server with TWO clients based on tcp socket. After connected, the SenderClient should send a message typed by user to Server, and Server should then forward that message to the ReceiverClient. It is likep  blockquote   pSenderClient  Server  ReceiverClientp blockquote  pOnly when user types quit in sender, all the programs will be terminated, otherwise they are always listening for messages.p  pNow I have met the problem that when I run that three programs in Eclipse Luna, what I found is that the message can be successfully passed from SenderClient  Server  ReceiverClient for only one time. And after that, the message will be blocked at the Server. Can you guys also run those three programs on your computer to see the strange phenomenon.

Positive 2888 pI have a Linux program split into two parts. p  pOne part does NAT traversal to obtain either a UDP socket UDP hole punching or a TCP socket TCP hole punching.

This works fine in FF, but not in IE, Chrome, etc. p  pScripts embedded within CDATA tags validate as well.p  pQuestion Is there a way to insert microtemplate in a script and still pass XHTML validation My idea was to remove the CDATA tags once the page has been loaded. But there are probably smarter ways. Note Id prefer not to inject HTML via js since the markup will be difficult to maintain.p  pPS I looked at other js templates, but they are either not XHTML compliant or too bulky.p  pTIA for any hints.p

Negative 2888 pI need a small unstructured database for my Ruby scripts. Not Sqlite, something more like a persistent hashtables would work perfectly, as long as it can store basic Ruby structures arrays, strings, hashes etc.  all serializable and wont get corrupted when Ruby scripts crash.p  pI know theres plenty of solutions like that for Perl with TieHash, so theres probably some gem like that for Ruby.

That not only requires all of it to fit memory, its On2. So neither of them seem like a particularly good solution.p

Negative 2888 pI eventually couldnt get any further with my program due to the various shortcomings of VB.NET bad audio support, no reading events in the middle of execution, very weak keyboard input, etc. So I tried SDL.NET 6.1.br  Despite its terrible documentation, I was able to fix my code to use it and I love it  p  pBut theres a problem.  I dont know how to set up my application settings for it. The Startup Object definitely should be a class the examples always are in classes, never modules, but a startup class specifically has to be a form  This is bad because SDL makes its own window via SetVideoMode you dont need a form.  So when the form constructor New finishes, ema useless form is created and you have two windows.emp  pI tried placing a call to the game engine loop within New so that the game starts up without New ever finishing.  The game runs normally, and this solves the second window problem... embut it cant be closedem  X button does nothing, calls to Events.QuitApplication or Me.Close are blatantly ignored, etc.p  pIm stumped. It seems I need to set a nonform class as the startup object, but it wont let me.p  pOh, by the way, it seems that there are two things called SDL NET. To clarify, Im using a hrefhttpcssdl.sourceforge.netindex.phpMain5FPage relnofollowthis onea, which exists in the strongSdlDotNetstrong namespace.p  pOh, I forgot to mention, I also noticed that a lot of the examples have a line that says [STAThread].  Is this is importantp  pstrongEDITstrong Ive already received and accepted an answer for my question, but I want to tell other people what the problem is with exitingclosing the app, even though that wasnt my questionbr  While SDL.NET allows you to receive input and run other events without having to stop running logic, emthe application still cannot quit while logic is being runem.  So I find the best way to tell your SDL.NET application to Quit in the middle of running logic is to use the following TWO lines  p  precodeSdlDotNet.Core.Events.QuitApplication End codepre  pPlace these in the handler for the SdlDotNet.Core.Events.Quit event, as well as anywhere else you want your program to quit. p

Negative 2888 pI would like to avoid producing a repeated namespace in my XSLT output.p  pI am using XSLT to massage some XML so that Microsofts DataContractSerializer sees fit to actually process it properly.

While valid XML, this confuses poor Microsoft.p  pSo I would like to completely avoid defining the feature namespace in the output XML by instead referring to the current elements namespace instead.

Negative 2888 pI have written a codeListViewcode with a text and image clubbed together in a row. I wanted to add a button on top of codelistviewcode, then the entire content of listview should be seen. codeButtoncode is named as More, when someone clicks it i will be updating the listcontent. That is the main theme.p  pCan anyone suggest how to do itp  h2My java file.h2  precodepackage com.example.firstandroid   import org.json.JSONArray import org.json.JSONObject  import android.app.ListActivity import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.graphics.Bitmap import android.graphics.BitmapFactory import android.os.Bundle import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.BaseAdapter import android.widget.ImageView import android.widget.TextView  public class Screen2 extends ListActivity    String result private static String DATA[]            Demonstrates how to write an efficient list adapter. The adapter used in this example binds   to an ImageView and to a TextView for each row in the list.     To work efficiently the adapter implemented here uses two techniques    It reuses the convertView passed to getView to avoid inflating View when it is not necessary    It uses the ViewHolder pattern to avoid calling findViewById when it is not necessary     The ViewHolder pattern consists in storing a data structure in the tag of the view returned by   getView. This data structures contains references to the views we want to bind data to, thus   avoiding calls to findViewById every time getView is invoked.     private static class EfficientAdapter extends BaseAdapter      private LayoutInflater mInflater     private Bitmap mIcon1     private Bitmap mIcon2      public EfficientAdapterContext context           Cache the LayoutInflate to avoid asking for a new one each time.         mInflater  LayoutInflater.fromcontext           Icons bound to the rows.         mIcon1  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcecontext.getResources, R.drawable.nextarrow         mIcon2  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcecontext.getResources, R.drawable.nextarrow                  The number of items in the list is determined by the number of speeches       in our array.             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetCount           public int getCount          return DATA.length1                  Since the data comes from an array, just returning the index is       sufficent to get at the data. If we were using a more complex data       structure, we would return whatever object represents one row in the       list.             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetItemint           public Object getItemint position          return position                  Use the array index as a unique id.             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetItemIdint           public long getItemIdint position          return position                  Make a view to hold each row.             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetViewint, android.view.View,            android.view.ViewGroup           public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent           A ViewHolder keeps references to children views to avoid unneccessary calls          to findViewById on each row.         ViewHolder holder           When convertView is not null, we can reuse it directly, there is no need          to reinflate it. We only inflate a new View when the convertView supplied          by ListView is null.         ifposition 0                      convertView  mInflater.inflateR.layout.main2, null                  else                    if convertView  null              convertView  mInflater.inflateR.layout.main1, null               Creates a ViewHolder and store references to the two children views              we want to bind data to.             holder  new ViewHolder             holder.text  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.text             holder.icon  ImageView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.icon              convertView.setTagholder          else               Get the ViewHolder back to get fast access to the TextView              and the ImageView.             holder  ViewHolder convertView.getTag                    Bind the data efficiently with the holder.         holder.text.setTextDATA[position]         holder.icon.setImageBitmapposition amp 1  1  mIcon1  mIcon2                  return convertView           static class ViewHolder          TextView text         ImageView icon        Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     Intent myIntent  new Intentthis , firstandroid.class     startActivityForResultmyIntent, 0     Bundle bun  getIntent.getExtras      result  bun.getStringmani       try          JSONObject jsonnew JSONObjectresult     JSONArray ja     json  json.getJSONObjectresponseData     ja  json.getJSONArrayresults      int resultCount  ja.length     DATA  new String[resultCount]     for int i  0 i lt resultCount i              JSONObject resultObject  ja.getJSONObjecti       DATA[i]resultObject.gettitleNoFormatting.toString       DATA[i]n       JSONArray addr       addr  resultObject.getJSONArrayaddressLines       int count  addr.length       forint j0jltcountj                  JSONObject resultObject1  ja.getJSONObjectj           DATA[i]addr.getStringj                          catchException e                 setListAdapternew EfficientAdapterthis  codepre  pp  h2My xml file. reslayouth2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt  LinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidorientationhorizontal  androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt  TextView androidididtext  androidlayoutgravitycentervertical  androidlayoutwidth0dip  androidlayoutweight1.0  androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt  ImageView androidididicon  androidlayoutwidth30dip  androidlayoutheight30dip gt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 2888 pThe name for Lisp derives from bLISbt bPbrocessing. Linked lists are the major data structure of Lisp languages, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure this is known as homoiconicity.p  pHowever, a list is by definition a sequential construct. This encourages us to solve problems using sequential language idioms algorithms that process one thing at a time and accumulate the results. For example, in a Lisp where emconsem cells are used to implement singlylinked lists, the emcarem operation returns the first element of the list, while emcdrem returns the rest of the list. My vision is of a functional language for parallel execution, that splits problems into roughly equal subproblems, recursively solves them, and combines the subsolutions.p  pPretty much every programming languages code is already parsed into trees is there a homoiconic language like Lisp, but with trees as the major data structure btw, Id call it Treep, for bTREEb bPbrocessing.p  pemUpdateem An interesting presentation PDF from 2009 by Guy Steele on parallel algorithms amp data structures, a hrefhttpresearch.sun.comprojectsplrgPublicationsICFPAugust2009Steele.pdf relnofollowemOrganizing Functional Code for Parallel Execution or, codefoldlcode and codefoldrcode Considered Slightly Harmfulema.p

Negative 2888 pSay Im making a QampA site like StackOverflow. I have two resources Question and Answer. Im using default Rails RESTful resource routes, so each resource has its own controller and methods for creating it.p  pIn the codequestionsshowcode view, I want to allow the user to submit an answer for the particular question. The form will POST to codeanswerscode, which will get routed as a request to the codeAnswersControllercode with a call to the codecreatecode method.p  pIf the answer was created, I can simply redirect back to the original question. However, Im running into trouble dealing with validation failures on the answer object. I need to render the codequestionshowcode view and show the validation errors for the answer object. Its not clear to me how to best do this.p  pHere are example snippets of what the two controllers might look like.p  precodeclass AnswersController lt ApplicationController   def create     answer  Answer.newparams[answer]     if answer.save       redirectto answer.question     else        What should go here     end   end end  class QuestionsController lt ApplicationController   def show     question  Question.findparams[id]     answer  Answer.newquestionid gt question.id   end end codepre  pWhat should go in the else clause of the codeAnswersControllercodes create method A redirect seems wrong, since the error is really caused by the same request. Calling something like coderender template gt questionsshowcode seems wrong too, since I have to initialize any instance variables that the template depends on.p  pThis style of having separate actions for calling GET to view the form for creating an object and calling POST to actually create the object seems to work well within a emsingleem controller.p  pHow can it be done across controllersp

Negative 2888 pI am looking for a way to implement friends.getMutualFriends of Facebooks Old REST API with FQL. The reasons are twofold 1. getMutualFriends only returns a list of IDs, and Id like to use a multiquery to fetch additional information for each returned ID rather than make additional calls to Facebook 2. Id like to batch a few such calls together. batch.run is a bit limited 20 calls and presumably slower than a multiquery.p  pUnfortunately, I probably cant use the friends table, because while the sourceID is of a user of my app, the targetID may not be a user of my app Facebook wont even let me select the friends of the target even in a nested query, which is understandable due to privacy concerns. But since I strongcanstrong get the mutual friends using friends.getMutualFriends, Im wondering if theres any FQL equivalent.p

Id like to specify these, and was hoping that there might be a way to define these menu items in XML, and when they are to be brought in by the app via being identified by the intentfilters, also pull the XML and inflateimport it somehow.  Any suggestions or pointersp  p2 In onCreateOptionsMenu, why is the addIntentOptions call with CATEGORYALTERNATIVE NOT adding the activities with intentfilter set to category.ALTERNATIVE to the menu not adding is correct behavior in this case, just trying to get my head around how the virtually identical calls to addIntentOptions in onCreateOptionsMenu and onPrepareOptionsMenu result in different menus.p

I had to comment out all the code and gradually add it back in  a long and painful process.

Not a single line would execute in the thread  including lines that came before it.  p  pAnyone care to guess the causep  pThe project file was targeting .Net 3.5.

Fortunately I was able to upgrade the project to 4.x and the problem disappeared.  Posting this here in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar mystery.  p

Negative 2888 pHaving trouble searching on this.   The only thing Ive found so far was related to a mapping API where for map markers JavaScript bogs down badly around 500 IDs.  Im pretty sure that was related to the particular scripts in use though and not a general rule.p  pI have a page with a complicated list.   Each item in the list has about 10 distinct IDs on it and theres several JavaScript scripts in play.   The list is paginating and the user has a choice of how many items to show per page.   Considering each item in the list has 10 IDs, Im wondering what I should set the maximum number of items per page to total number of records the user can choose to view at one time on a page.p  pI mean  aside from increased load times based on the raw number of records, is there a known number of ids where a limit is hit or where CSSJavaScript performance starts to degrade sharplyp  pEdit  Pardon, each item is complex business card to paint a picture with three divs in play and a small form.

Negative 2888 pToday, I was checking source code of the CRT library of Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 and I found a bug into the file mtdll.h. The problem is with the macro FLSGETVALUE. On x86 systems, this macro call directly TlsGetValue instead of making a call to the function assigned to the variable gpFlsGetValue. p  pFirst of all, its a problem because FlsAlloc, FlsGetValue, FlsFree and FlsSetValue are not available on all system Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003. These functions behave like TlsAlloc, TlsGetValue, TlsFree and TlsSetValue but support Fiberskind of user thread. Because we should prefer using Fls functions instead of Tls functions, the C runtime library of VS check if the Fls functions are availables when the process or the dll is loaded and initialise the gpFls variables. If the Fls are not available, the CRT initialise these variables with the equivalent Tls functions.p  pYou cannot use the macro FLSGETVALUE directly into your code because its used internally by the runtime library. The runtime use this macro to initialise per thread data of the runtime library.p  pMy question is about the impact of this bug. I know that fiber are not widely used, but if you develop a DLL that is used inside an application that use fiber, what can be the impact Does this bug can cause a crash of the application or only produce false results Does this problem can cause problem with widely used application like SQL Server What do you think Does this bug can be a security risk Does IIS or ASP.Net use fiber that can cause a crash p  pFor curious people, here the current source of the problematic line in mtdll.hp  pcodedefine FLSGETVALUE    PFLSGETVALUEFUNCTIONTlsGetValuegetvalueindexcodep  pHere a fixed version of the macro FLSGETVALUE p  pcodedefine FLSGETVALUE    PFLSGETVALUEFUNCTIONDecodePointergpFlsGetValuegetvalueindexcodep  pFor now, I should find how to submit a bug to Microsoft.p

Negative 2888 pI was wondering in Eclipse if its possible to intercept when a user hits save or ctrl  s via some sort of listener.

Afterwards, I would like the file to be compiled as per normal. Is this at all possible Similar to the idea of a database trigger I suppose. p

Newer Firefoxes and Google Chrome should work.p  pMy next phase is to create a simple collapsible comment section under each of the bubble info sections. Im guessing PHP is the way to go. What I need is super simple messaging board where conversations can be continued under comments to the main tree which can be collapsed. Theres some tutorials for similar things online but if anyone knows a good method Id appreciate the guidance. As you can guess I have no experience with databases etc. so I dont know if security could be an issue with my beginner skills. I also need a simple moderation tool. Otherwise what id like to do is let the users attach pins to the map which would show when a comment is highlighted. Is this kind of interaction between the PHP and JS feasiblep  pI appreciate any tips with anything.p  pThank you for your help, Ilkka Syrjakarip

Doing it in ES 2.0 by using a shader is a piece of cake, but is it possible to do in ES 1.xp  h2UPDATEh2  pThanks to datenwolf, Im doing it like thatp  precodeGLfloat weightsvector[4]  0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722, 1.0 GLfloat additionsvector[4]  0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0  glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLTEXTUREENVMODE, GLCOMBINE   First part  glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLCOMBINERGB, GLDOT3RGB glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLSRC0RGB, GLTEXTURE glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLSRC1RGB, GLCONSTANT glTexEnvfvGLTEXTUREENV, GLTEXTUREENVCOLOR, weightsvector   Second part  glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLCOMBINERGB, GLADD glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLSRC0RGB, GLPREVIOUS glTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLSRC1RGB, GLCONSTANT glTexEnvfvGLTEXTUREENV, GLTEXTUREENVCOLOR, additionsvector codepre  pThe first part renders fine if I leave it on its own, but if I add the second one, it uses black as the previous colour and so I get only gray pixels.

However, if I used codeGLTEXTURE1code I get not even gray pixels, but black. Im getting lost here...p  h2THIRD UPDATEh2  pThe second part is working now. Shouldve just used the name of the previous texture as datenwolf had suggestedp  pHowever, the output was still not correct as it was inverted. I fixed that by addingp  precodeglTexEnviGLTEXTUREENV, GLOPERAND0RGB, GLONEMINUSSRCCOLOR codepre  pNow, its too dark. And I cant get it right.

Of course, I could first divide the input by 2.0, then add 0.5, do a dot3 and then again multiply by 2, thus effectively having all values in the range [1.0, 0.0]. But I fear it would still loose accuracy because of the division.p  pI suspect that the DOT wasnt intended for this purpose, more likely only for bumpmapping or something. Too bad. I hope Im wrong, but I dont see how.p

Negative 2888 pFrustrated by the current reporting offerings limitations SSRS, Crystal Reports, and my users being primarily financialbusiness people familiar with Excel, I am considering to write my own reporting engine using an Excel component like SpreadsheetGear or Aspose.Cells, and integrate it in our WinForms application.p  pBoth libraries offer a spreadsheet viewer WinForms component, so the generated spreadsheet report will be shown to the user in a form, after saving its parameters, and he could then save it.p  pIve done this on a separate winforms project and it is obviously easy. Just put the parameters controls, in the form, connect to the database, generate the spreadsheet and it is done.p  pHowever, doing this for every report would obviously involves a significant duplication of boilerplate code and form design and reduces the maintainability and upgradability of the application.p  pAs such, I am considering writing the reports as plugins DLL, which would only provide the codelogic to generate the report, and would return the final worksheet object to the caller the Report Preview form.p  pAfter giving it some thought, I think the responsibilities between the caller and the addin would be shared as belowp  pThe report DLLaddin would provide the caller the master UI a list of the parameters that the user needs to be pass for this report, along with its name, its possible values list of a combobox, for example.p  pIt would then be up to the master UI to create those on the form. The control type would be inferred based on the datatype of the parameter a string would be an TextBox, etc.p  pThe master UI would pass to the report DLL the filled parameters to the report generation method, along with some application specific settings connection string, applications username.p  pThe Report DLL would then generate the report and return to the master UI the generated worksheetreport object and display it on the preview control.p  pTo achieve this technically, I believe that I need to create an interface for my reports DLLs, and implement methods likep  precodeListltReportParametergt GetReportsParameters Report GenerateReport codepre  pFrom the master UI, I would access them and call them through Reflection.p  pDoes it sound like a good strategy and does it leave decent room for future extensibility I would like to achieve a good balance between modularity while not being restrained in flexibility by my addin architecture being too static for the future.p  pWould you have some useful tips to ensure this and share if you achieved similar things in the pastp  pThank you.p  pIm developing in C, .Net 4.0 and WinForms.

Negative 2888 pI have been trying to get the hang of TDD and unit testing in python, using nose and there are a few basic concepts which Im stuck on.  Ive read up a lot on the subject but nothing seems to address my issues  probably because theyre so basic theyre assumed to be understood.p  ol lipThe idea of TDD is that unit tests are written before the code they test.  Unit test should test small portions of code e.g. functions which, for the purposes of the test, are selfcontained and isolated.  However, this seems to me to be highly dependent on the implementation.  During implementation, or during a later bugfix it may become necessary to abstract some of the code into a new function.  Should I then go through all my tests and mock out that function to keep them isolated  Surely in doing this there is a danger of introducing new bugs into the tests, and the tests will no longer test exactly the same situationpli lipFrom my limited experience in writing unit tests, it appears that completely isolating a function sometimes results in a test that is longer and more complicated than the code it is testing.  So if the test fails all it tells you is that there is either a bug in the code or in the test, but its not obvious which.  Not isolating it may mean a much shorter and easier to read test, but then its not a unit test...pli lipOften, once isolated, unit tests seem to be merely repeating the function.  E.g. if there is a simple function which adds two numbers, then the test would probably look something like codeassert adda, b  a  bcode.  Since the implementation is simply codereturn a  bcode, whats the point in the test  A far more useful test would be to see how the function works within the system, but this goes against unit testing because it is no longer isolated.pli lipMy conclusion is that unit tests are good in some situations, but not everywhere and that system tests are generally more useful. The approach that this implies is to write system tests first, then, if they fail, isolate portions of the system into unit tests to pinpoint the failure.  The problem with this, obviously, is that its not so easy to test corner cases.  It also means that the development is not fully test driven, as unit tests are only written as needed.pli ol  pSo my basic questions arep  ol liShould unit tests be used everywhere, however small and simple the functionli liHow does one deal with changing implementations  I.e. should the implementation of the tests change continuously too, and doesnt this reduce their usefulnessli liWhat should be done when the test gets more complicated than the code its testingli liIs it always best to start with unit tests, or is it better to start with system tests, which at the start of development are much easier to writeli ol

Negative 2888 pSo Ive come across this weird problem where I have an object, which has a pointer to another object, and of that object I want to access a variable. I can do that in the constructor, but it doesnt work when Im in a function.p  pa hrefhttppastebin.com2FHd7ak0 relnofollowhttppastebin.com2FHd7ak0ap  pEDITbr The variable state of the blocks seems to change after I initalized them.

Negative 2888 pI have two different data sources for which I need two different codePersistenceManagerFactorycode. This I can always get by writing a codepersistence.xmlcode file. But I want this to be represented programmatically. Though the second datasource remains relatively unchanged, the first datasource may have additions to it via plugins. These plugins can come with one or more JDO annotated classes. A codepersitance.xmlcode wouldnt be such a good idea here because I want them to be loaded at runtime.p  pIn Hibernate and with JPA this would be possible by creating a configuration object and adding all annotated classes to it. Whenever I see a new plugin being loaded, I can always shutdown the codeSessionFactorycode and reload it with the extra classes from plugin by looking at codeEntitycode annotation.p  pIs there a similar way to do it in DataNucleusJDOp  pI tried searching it on Google, but all I end up is at a hrefhttpwww.datanucleus.orgproductsdatanucleusjpapersistenceunit.html relnofollowDataNucleus sitea explaining how to write a codepersitence.xmlcode file.p

Negative 2888 pI just started using SQLCLR for creating a very basic trigger... but while I did that another question poped up.. Is there anyway to actually make a SQLtrigger to trigger a method inside a webapplication.. My first idea was to have a web service which would be located in the webapplicatoion which the SQLCLR then called.. The whole idea is that once the trigger gets triggered.. it will call a SignalRhub which then alerts the client about that something happened in the database.. the whole thing is more experimental for me.. The reason I cant use the webserviceway.. is that it would require an additional request for each time the trigger gets triggeredp

One is using a codeFileStreamcode  I create a write codeFileStreamcode and download chunks one by one into the same stream without rewinding and so I end up with an original file. The other option is creating a codeMemoryStreamcode object by passing a number slightly larger than the original file size as the stream size to avoid reallocations and downloading the chunks into that codeMemoryStreamcode  this way I end up with a codeMemoryStreamcode holding the original file data.p  pHeres some pseudocodep  precodevar writeStream  new StreamOfChoice params  foreach uri in urisToDownload       blobContainer.GetBlobReference uri .DownloadToStream writeStream   codepre  pNow the only difference is that its a codeFileStreamcode in one case and a codeMemoryStreamcode in the other, all the rest is the same.

According to codeMemoryAvailable Bytescode performance counter the virtual machine has about 1 gigabyte memory available at the moment before codeMemoryStreamcode is created, so its not due to paging.p  pWhy would writing to a file be faster than to a codeMemoryStreamcodep

Negative 2888 pI have a polynomial of order N where N is even. This polynomial is equal to minus infinity for x minusplus infinity thus it has a maximum. What I am doing right now is taking the derivative of the polynomial by using codepolydercode then finding the roots of the N1 th order polynomial by using the coderootscode function in Matlab which returns N1 solutions. Then I am picking the real root that really maximizes the polynomial. The problem is that I am updating my polynomial a lot and at each time step I am using the above procedure to find the maximizer. Therefore, the roots function takes too much of a computation time making my application slow. Is there a way either in Matlab or a proposed algorithm that does this maximization in a computationally efficient fashion i.e. just finding one solution instead of N1 solutions Thanks.p  pEdit I would also like to know whether there is a routine in Matlab that only returns the real roots instead of  coderootscode which returns all realcomplex ones.p

Negative 2888 pIm working with Pythonnumpyscipy to write a small ray tracer. Surfaces are modelled as twodimensional functions giving a height above a normal plane.

Negative 2888 pI want to add a side navigation menu to my android app like Facebook, Google, Spotify, Prixing, Evernote, etcp  pI already had a look here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8657894androidfacebookstyleslide8673805Android facebook style slidea and here  a hrefhttpsgithub.comGregadeauxandroidflyinappnavigation relnofollowhttpsgithub.comGregadeauxandroidflyinappnavigationap  pBy following this last link, I got a working implementation which I customized a bit.p  pimg srchttpi1157.photobucket.comalbumsp588alexisboth.png p  pAs you can see the action bar doesnt slide. Thats normal since its not a part of the sliding view in the Gregadeauxs implementation.p  pId like to include the actionbar in the sliding view. Its probably possible by making a custom implementation of the actionbar but Id like to keep the original one.p  pThe Google app seems not to use a custom actionbar.p  pimg srchttpi1157.photobucket.comalbumsp588alexisgoogleplus.png p  pAny idea how I can do that Thanks p  pEDIT After some search I eventually found that the Google app is using a custom actionbar implementation.p
Negative 2888 pJust suppose we are debugging a function codefoocode, and we want to modify it again and again and run it with some arguments  codefoobarHello, bazHow are youcode  to be sure the problem is solved. p  pAfter a modification of the codefoocode body, we run the lines of the function definition  to make the function modified  and now, we have to search over the history for the line containing codefoobarHello, bazHow are youcode to see if the modified codefoocode works properly.  Searching the history can also be replaced by continued pressing the Up key until it reaches before the function definition, when the last time we run codefoobarHello, bazHow are youcode. p  pThe other possibility is to keep codefoobarHello, bazHow are youcode in the clipboard and every time we modify the codefoocode body, we just paste codefoobarHello, bazHow are youcode from the clipboard and run it. p  pBut all of these solutions are quite hard if we are modifying several functions with long bodies at the same time. The best possibility I have taught is to hide the function definitions from the history  when we are working with native R environment or with IDEs like RStudio. Is there any possibility to do this Is there any better solutionp
Negative 2888 pIve a question about region selections. Ive created a function to switch the selected region in a different way like coderegionsSelectablecode. By using coderegionsSelectablecode I can select more than one region, with my function I want to switch the selected region to the current selected region only one region is selected every time. p  pTo realise this Ive used the function codeclearSelectedRegionscode if codelength of SelectedRegions gt 1code after these all regions are deselected. Ive saved the newest region in a separate variable. To show the current region as a selected region Ive changed two values.p  pcontainer is the map object, GER is the example regionbr  firstly codecontainer.regions.GER.element.isSelected  falsecodebr  secondly codecontainer.regions.GER.element.setSelectedtruecodep  pBut these is a bad way to change a lot of regions... p  pSo the question is, how can I change the same values by using codesetSelectedRegionscodep

Negative 2888 pIm developping a GUI based on matplotlib and wxpython, for Windows. I have an issue that becomes visible when the Windows XP theme green Start button, blue taskbar is used. Im quite sure the same problem will show up on Vista as well. I know an imperfect workaround, but I cant fix this issue properly.p  pMy matplotlib plots are embedded in wxPanels, which are embedded in a wxNotebook tabs, if you prefer. With some themes, the background colour of the tabs is actually a gradient, and wx tries to match it with a colour close to it. This is the imperfect workaround the colour matches at the top of the window, but not at the bottom.p  pThat is why I would like to actually use a matplotlib plot with a transparent background. When I set the facecolor of the figure to be transparent, it actually takes the colour of the desktop or whatever window is located behind, not the wxPanelwxNotebook. If I resize the window, the transparent part accumulates drawn data. This last issue is not themespecific anymore, I observe it on the Windows Classic one as well.p  pIn the example code below, I would rather expect the transparent part of the figure to show the blue colour set on the panel embedding the plot.p  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeimport wx import matplotlib matplotlib.useWXAgg from matplotlib.figure import Figure from matplotlib.backends.backendwxagg import FigureCanvasWxAgg import wxversion import sys  class MyFrame  wx.Frame       def init self, parent          wx.Frame.init  self, parent, id  wx.IDANY, title  wx.EmptyString, pos  wx.DefaultPosition, size  wx.Size 300,650 , style  wx.DEFAULTFRAMESTYLEwx.TABTRAVERSAL           self.SetSizeHintsSz wx.DefaultSize, wx.DefaultSize           bSizer3  wx.BoxSizer wx.VERTICAL           self.mnotebook2  wx.Notebook self, wx.IDANY, wx.DefaultPosition, wx.DefaultSize, 0          self.mpanel1  wx.Panel self.mnotebook2, wx.IDANY, wx.DefaultPosition, wx.DefaultSize, wx.TABTRAVERSAL          bSizer4  wx.BoxSizer wx.VERTICAL           self.mpanel2  wx.Panel self.mpanel1, wx.IDANY, wx.DefaultPosition, wx.DefaultSize, wx.TABTRAVERSAL          self.mpanel2.SetBackgroundColour wx.SystemSettings.GetColour wx.SYSCOLOURACTIVECAPTION            bSizer4.Add self.mpanel2, 1, wx.EXPAND wx.ALL, 5           self.mpanel1.SetSizer bSizer4          self.mpanel1.Layout         bSizer4.Fit self.mpanel1          self.mnotebook2.AddPage self.mpanel1, ua page, False           bSizer3.Add self.mnotebook2, 1, wx.EXPAND wx.ALL, 0           self.SetSizer bSizer3          self.Layout          self.Centre wx.BOTH       def del self          pass      class MyPlot     def initself, panel, notebook         self.panel  panel         self.panel.figure  FigureNone, dpiNone         self.panel.canvas  FigureCanvasWxAggself.panel, 1, self.panel.figure         self.panel.axes  self.panel.figure.addsubplot111         self.panel.Bindwx.EVTSIZE, self.onSize           I want this code to work whatever the theme.

At the end of the method call codesequentiallyFadeIn...code I would like to perform the codecleanUpcode where I want to remove the flag class which I added in the selected elements inside the codesequentiallyFadeIn...code method.p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquerylatest.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt document.readyfunction       function sequentialFadeInselectorText, speed, display, callBack           display  typeof display  undefined  display  block          function helper              nextElementToFadeIn  selectorText.not.alreadyFadedIn.first             nextElementToFadeIn.fadeInspeed, function                  this.addClassalreadyFadedIn                 helper             .cssdisplay, display                  helper          callBackselectorText                sequentialFadeIn.toBeFaddedIn, slow, inlineblock,function cleanUpselectorText1             selectorText1.removeClassalreadyFadedIn             console.logClean up has been performed.                     console.logSelector Text  selectorText1               ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygtltstyle mediascreen typetextcssgt .hello      backgroundcolor blue     height50px     width 50px     display none   ltstylegt  ltdiv classhello toBeFaddedIngtltdivgt ltdiv classhello toBeFaddedIngtltdivgt ltdiv classhello toBeFaddedIngtltdivgt ltdiv classhello toBeFaddedIngtltdivgt ltdiv classhello toBeFaddedIngtltdivgt  ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pWhile looking at the inspect element I notice that class codealreadyFadedIncode is not getting removed.

Also, I stop the previous song like this p  precode.partaudio[songnumber].currentTime  0     . part audio[songnumber].pause codepre  pSo, if the previous track wasnt loaded fully or was loaded partially, this string p  precode.partaudio[songnumber].currentTime  0 codepre  pwill return error Uncaught Error INVALIDSTATEERR DOM Exception 11.

Negative 2888 pI am attempting to create a radar animation using data from the National Weather Service. For static images they make it easy by always having the same filename. However, for the historical images, they are timestamped, and always change. Thus, to get the previous N images, you would have to know the filenames beforehand. They do, however, provide a directory which provides a listing for each site. See the example here a hrefhttpradar.weather.govridgeRadarImgN0RFWS relnofollowhttpradar.weather.govridgeRadarImgN0RFWSap  pWhat I need is from my Rails app to extract the last N images from that directory. Is that possible I could imagine one option would be to download and then scrape that page, but I am assuming there is a better wayp  pThanksp

Negative 2888 pI have built a GUI with some text boxes and a pushbutton. When I execute the GUI from MATLAB, it produces the desired plot on a separate window. The plot is created by a function that is stored in the same directory and is called in the callback function of pushbutton. p  pWhen I package it with the .m file of the GUI as the main file, I get an exe. When this exe runs, it normally takes data from data source sqlserver but then does not give the plot in a separate window as within matlab also not in the same GUI window. There is a sound and from the behaviour it seems that the plots appears and vanishes in a very short time. But this is my perception and may be wrong, maybe it is some error message that is suppressed.p  pWhat can I do to solve thisp

But the new one using 78 mb approximately on the same page.p  pHeres the top two rows from webgrindp  precode   Function                                     Invocation Count    Total Self Cost    Total Inclusive Cost    ComposerAutoloadClassLoadergtloadClass     224                 23.31       47.20    ComposerAutoloadClassLoadergtfindFile      224                 9.57        10.23 codepre  pAlso tried tha apaches ab toolp  precode   ab n 50 c 5 C PHPSESSIDSESSIONID httpmyhost.com codepre  pResult isp  precode   Percentage of the requests served within a certain time ms    50    368    66    506    75    601    80    666    90   1073    95   1812    98   2278    99   2278    100   2278 longest request codepre  pAll these results from the production server not localhost.p  pIs 78 mb for a single page normal If not, how can i reduce it Should i look for it in zf2 or composerp  pI can give code samples if you need.

Negative 2888 pSo, this is rather complicated.p  pI have a set of rules in a collection, a rule contains these three properties.p  precodeField, Op, and Data all strings codepre  pSo a rule might look like State, eq, CAp  pMy general rules are that all rules are ANDed together.  However, with the caveat that, if they have the same Field value, those all ORed.  This allows us to say State, eq, CA, OR State, eq, TX AND FirstName, eq, John.p  pThe issue is that my current way of applying rules wont work, because it just keeps building up the linq expression using each rule to make it more and more explicit.p  precodevar result  rules.Aggregaterepository.All, current, rule gt current.ExtendQueryrule codepre  pcodeExtendQuerycode is an extension method I wrote, it uses ExpressionTrees, to generate a new query, that applies the current rule to the passed in query. effectively ANDing them all togetherp  pNow it wouldnt be hard for me to modify the code.Aggregatecode line to group the rules by Field, and then generate the a unique query for each Field, but then how do I get it to OR them together instead of ANDp  pAnd then with each of those queries, how would I AND them together  A Unionp  pExtendQuery looks like thisp  precode    public static IQueryableltTgt ExtendQueryltTgtthis IQueryableltTgt query,

Negative 2888 pRecently i have ported a video decoder to android successfully. Also dumped the output on a surfaceview and checked the output using native APIs. Now the next task is to implement play, pause, streaming etc. i.e. the other features of the media player. Doing this will be a rework as all these functionalities are already defined in the android multimedia framework. I heard that we can make our decoder as a plugin and integrate it into Androids multimedia framework. Although i googled regarding the same, i could hardly find any info regarding the same. So i kindly request any of the readers to suggest some relavent links or solution for the above problem. Thanks in advance, waiting for your reply.p

Negative 2888 pI am building a simple ssh login wrapper tool to help auto login to one of a hell of a lot of servers.br It first takes descriptions from user input and then extract the corresponding most relevant server IP and password stored safely somewhere, using which it creates a piece of expect script. p  pThe expect script looks something like thisp  pre     spawn ssh2 q t Bob172.23.24.35     expect          assword send Bob123r          interact pre  pWhen I pipe this to expect expect can read script from stdin everything  goes well until  it reaches interact.  Expect claims that it receives eof and  terminates immediately. Then I store this into a file say tmp.exp the same problem  happens when I do expect lt tmp.exp. However when I execute expect f tmp.exp  everything is OK. p  pI think that the reason is interact takes input from fd0 which is redirected to a pipe by my program or shell.  Does this mean that I can not use interact when I do  something like expect lt xx.exp   Is there a way to resume fd0 to the real terminal before the interact command  I googled a lot and all I got is something like closeoneof 0. I cant find its meaning nor how it works. Thanks in advancep

Negative 2888 pIve been working on a gallery made in php. Some time ago, I made the layout using tables. It worked out super. Now, using tables for layouts is not recommended and sort of deprecated I dont understand why, if someone could explain this to me, thank you.

So far I managed this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethochvater4DbUU relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethochvater4DbUUa . MY FIRST QUESTION is this how do I make the panelpoze div to show up in the top of the container div, glued to the panelalbume as it is now I dont understand why panelalbume is lined with the 3rd div contained by the div it is glued to panelalbume. My second question would be this cant I just put the big table you can imagine easily how it looks by the structure of the divs into a container div and sort of leave it as it was...would this still be considered deprecated or not recommendedp  pTHE CSS CODEp  precode    body      backgroundcolor black     color white  fontface      fontfamilyjohnhandy     src urljohnhandy.eot     src local,

The idea here is once the user tabs off the Country box or loses focus it will submit the form and thus it will save. That works fine.p  pScenario 2 Now, if a user fills in information and their cursor focus moves to the last dropdown for Country and they decide to clear out the entire form by clicking the Clear submit button on the screen. I want this to clear out the entire form instead of submitting the entry. p  pI thought that by using .blur where the focus is on the dropdown box, it doesnt lose focus when the user clicks the button and it should clear out the form, because the focus wasnt moved when the button was clicked. However, I am wrong. p
Negative 2888 pEDIT figured it out, see answer below.p  pIm having a problem trying to render to a texture in OpenGL ES 2.0 on Android NDK on Samsung Galaxy Sp  pMore specifically i am using a Framebuffer to render to a texture and then i draw from that texture onto the backbuffer  in the emulator running 4.2.2 and on a Galaxy S2 it renders perfectly, and the same goes for running on a number of iOS devices with the same code.p  pThe Galaxy S is running 2.3.3 i cant convince the emulator to do this in 2.3.3.p  pWhen i set the texture size to 1024x1024 it looks as though it is still being stored in a 512x512 texture, or like some heavy compression is going on, this happens only on the Galaxy S, both an S2, the emulator and the iOS devices render flawlessly.p  pIf i set the texture to 512x512 it seems to render pretty much ok on the Galaxy S, nothing glaring is wrong but you will notice some of the same blurring happing just to a much lesser extentp  pScreenshot of 1024x1024p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCMV8V.png altScreensshot of 1024x1024p  pScreenshot og 512x512p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTT8Zz.png altScreenshot og 512x512p  pOn both images the upper 4 items are drawn first to the texture and then from there unto the backbuffer the flaw in the black one is also a Galaxy S only problem, but im not considdering it relatedp  pI can load a 1024x1024 texture and render from that just fine, and if i use glReadPixels on the textures render buffer it looks just fine too GL ES unfortunately doesnt support reading the pixels off the underlying texture directlyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Zedu.png altSaved framebuffer at 1024x1024p  pAs you may note it suffers none of the blurryness not even the light kind of the 512x512 version.p  pTo further mystify me i have an older project in Java running OpenGL ES 1.1 that renders to a 1024x1024 texture without any problems on the same Galaxy S device, i have not been desperate enough to write a complete ES 2.0 rendering in Java to see if that makes a difference and i havent tried ES 1.1 with the NDK as the OES extension methods for the framebuffer create linker errors its possible there is a lib that could be linked, i may go there if no one has any better ideasp  pI have however tried creating the framebuffer and texture in java and passing the handles to the native code but it makes no difference.p  pAny pointers, guesses, hunches, magic keywords for google, anything is very much appreciated i have spent 12 hours straight today trying to figure this out and i have made no progress what so ever, im nearing desperate.p  pFollowing is snippets of code that may be relevant, dont hesitate to ask for more the entire project is thousands of lines spanning 3 platforms at this point so

Negative 2888 pI very recently wrote a program for a friend where it simplifies some important daily calculations for himher. Now, the problem I am having is that I want to compile the code into an executable program so that heshe can comfortably run it on their machine, perhaps with a simple graphical interface or whatnot.p  pI have tried using cxFreeze with Python 3.3.0 64 bit but to no avail the program simply refuses to start on their machine I even tried generating an executable via 32bit Python, but also to no avail. What I then thought was that I could perhaps generate an executable program via PyGame But the fact of the matter is that I have never used any Pythonrelated program except the IDLE, so I am not sure what to do and look for.p  pAnother option would perhaps be to convert the Python 3.3.0 code to Python 2.x, but the problem is that I am not familiar with Python 2.x and neither is there any automated converter available as far as I know. I was wondering whether anyone of you could direct me to any good sourceslinks, since those I have been ferociously Googling are rather inconcrete. p

Negative 2888 pOne of the best practices of writing RESTFul api application, is to add versioning. for examplep  precodehttpmyserverapiv1getData httpmyserverapiv2getData codepre  pOur application exposes REST api using the Spring framework. We mark a class as a Controller, use RequestMapping annotation to map URL to a function, and add some objects that are translated to  from json objects.p  pFor examplep  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST, value  apiv1getData public ResponseBody ResponseDataDTO getDataRequestBody OperationsDetailsTDO details ... codepre  pNow, we want to provide the second version of the API. Around 23 of the functions remain the same, and 13 are changing. The changes are in both logic and the JSON objects.p  pI wonder how to design the code. I think that this kind of code is hard to managep  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST, value  apiversionvargetData public ResponseBody ResponseDataDTO createReleaseFromTemplatePathVariableversionvar Integer version, RequestBody OperationsDetailsTDO details  if version  1     doForVersion1  else if version  2     doForVersion2    codepre  pIt will be hard to manage, since in each function there will be different branching. Just to demonstrate the problem, if I have an automatic tool that generates documentation  it wont be able to understand what is the API.p  pSecond, I wonder what should I do with the classes that are binded to JSON object. Do I need to duplicate all of these classes, for minor changesp  pThx.p
Negative 2888 pI am developing a Google chrome app on Windows 7 that is a simple clockalarm.

Still, I know that the updateClock function is being called every minute since the alarm sounds at the proper time.p  pHowever, if I bring the screen back on by moving the mouse or pressing the keyboard, my app shows the clock value when the screen went off say 201pm, while the current time might be 330pm. If I hover the mouse over the app or wait for another minute, the app updates to the proper time 330pm.p  pIt seems that Google chrome stops rendering the HTML page when the screen is off and does not do a quick rendering when the screen is back on again.

Negative 2888 pI want to use SDL with SDLmain.lib because Im designing something for a class, so it needs to be simple.p  pWhen I click the X on the display window as opposed to console window, if I have one, the program doesnt end.  It also doesnt end when I hit Escape, which would be nice.  Finally, when I try to Show the Desktop in Windows, if an SDL program is running, nothing happens.  I include this in case its related.p  pIf I werent using SDLmain, Id edit WndProc.  Come to think of it, SDLmain surely should have WndProc but doesnt.  What can I do to tell SDL to respond to these messages  I can SDLPollEvent in main, but a that would mean Id have to have an eventchecking loop in main, which isnt always suitable, and b Im not sure how Id tell it to listen for clicking the X.p

Negative 2888 pIm trying to implement Spot Metering using an android phone.                 parameters.setautoexposure, spotmeteringp  pHowever, Im a bit confused as to how the metering works. If I understand correctly, Spot Metering works by selecting a region that it uses to set exposure values.p  pHowever, when flattening the Camera.Parameters class and displaying the results, metering area was 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 [meaning it has zero width, height, and weight] while the autoexposure setting was correctly spotmetering. In the API, however, getMeteringAreas documentation says that the metering area CANNOT have zero width and height.p  pSo how can I be using spotmetering while meteringarea is size 0 I tried setting the meteringarea to the upper right hand corner but it didnt have any effect on exposure.p  pThis leads me to believe that autoexposurespotmetering doesnt have anything to do with the metering areas....which is strange. p  pIf thats not the case, can someone please help me understand what Im doing wrong If you need more information, Ill be happy to include code.p  pIf that is the case as in, metering areas has nothing to do with spot metering, can someone help me figure out how to CHOOSE the spot that autoexposure meters from I think it defaults to the center.p  pThanksp

This happens only if i start the mediaplayer in conjunction with the Intent.ACTIONSCREENOFF.p  pIf i start the mediaplayer before that intent, for example in the onCreate function of the service and then turn off the screen, turn it back on lock screen, press the pause button, turn it off again and finally turn it on again, the media controls are visible and in pause state on the lock screen.p  pBut if i start the mediaplayer after receiving the Intent.ACTIONSCREENOFF, then the above problem happens.p  pCan it have something to do with that, that i start the mediaplayer inside the braodcastreceiverclass, which is inside the service, when the problem happens Or should you simply not start a mediaplayer after the screen has turned off although you have a wake lockp

Negative 2888 pDisclaimer This IS homework, so please dont just give me code, Id like a sort of explanation of how I could go about doing this with as little actual code as possible.p  pSo I have two integer arrays that are unsorted and equal length, and can contain duplicate values. As this is homework, there is the strange condition that Im not allowed to use anything from java.utils or sort the array.p  pIm supposed to check if the two arrays contain identical elements regardless of order. So comparing the arrays [5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 3] and [6, 6, 7, 5, 5, 3] would return true, while comparing [7,7 8] and  [7, 8, 8] would not.p  pIm at a loss to how to do this, Ive searched up questions but they all seem to use either something from java.utils, or the arrays do not contain duplicates. Ive tried doing looping through each value in the first array, and for each value loop through the second array checking if that value exists there, but it trips up on duplicates. p  pId be greatful for any sort of help, advice, or tips in the right direction. Thanksp

Below is the code snippetp  precodevar first   true iffirst  true submitform .required.filtervisible.eachfunction      var input  this     ifthis.isempty         this.cssborder,1px solid FF0004         this.addClasshighlight         this.afterltdiv classerrortextgtRequiredltdivgt         first  false         return false     else         return true        else   submitform .required.filtervisible.eachfunction      var input  this     ifthis.isempty         this.cssborder,1px solid FF0004         this.addClasshighlight                   I ned to remove the Required text here or else it will get added twice.         this.after                   Add the text here                     this.afterltdiv classerrortextgtRequiredltdivgt         return false     else         return true        codepre  pSo when the user clicks the submit button for first time first  true, it validates and which ever field is empty, it will display that red border and the text as well. This is working fine. Now when the user fills in some fields and again enter submit, there are some more mandatory fields that are not filled in. So now I want the filled fields to be remove the border and the Required text and then display red and Required for those that are empty now. I tried so many things and I am sick with this. Somehow I am not getting a right logic for this.  Can some body out there help me in this I dont want to use validate plugin.p

Negative 2888 pOn two sites I manage one of our security routines has been detecting some problematic query strings mostly coming from the Russian Federation if the IPs arent spoofed.p  pEg codemember.phpdataphenterminepricescode  or codemember.phpdatagetonlineviagracodep  pOur practice with SQL Injection flagged URIs in this case the quotes has been to use PHP codeheaderLocationcode and direct them elsewhere.p  pMy question is whether this is sufficient or the best practice.  I know the site has not been compromised as I have cron jobs that alert me to any modified or new files within minutes but I am still concerned about backlink poisoning from aggregation sites. Should I send a 403 or 404 or 301 http header insteadp  pBear in mind that the intended recipients of the rejection or redirection are legitimate spiders from Google et all following these spurious backlinks hosted on SEO bad guy sites. We want to let Google know these are spurious by our handling of the incoming request.p

Negative 2888 pIm running into a weird problem. I have a WinForms application that opens another program billing system emulator, sets it as a child window and then disables it. This works fine, the user cannot send any keys to the that child window, and the winforms application does its thing, sending commands to the child window.p  pHowever, its been discovered that pushing the kbdshiftkbd or kbdcontrolkbd, even if the winforms application doesnt have focus, causes an error in the billing system emulator as they arent valid keys. Users have taken to not using the kbdshiftkbd or kbdcontrolkbd keys while the winforms app runs but thats obviously not a practical solution.p  pMy attempted solution wasp  ol liGlobal keyboard hook to capture when those keys are pressed.li liOverriding codeOnKeyDowncode in the winforms application to stop those keys.li ol  pThat however still doesnt solve the problem of the kbdshiftkbd and kbdaltkbd keys being sent to the child window when the winforms app is not in focus. I can stop kbdshiftkbd and kbdaltkbd globally while the winforms app is running but I dont think that is valid. So I need to somehow in the global hook stop the codekeypresscode for the winforms app and its children but allow globally. Any ideasthoughtsp  pThis is a hrefhttppastebin.comr8KF2ejP relnofollowmy codea.p

The second fiddle contains coderowspancode attributes, which dont have CSS equivalents.p  pThe HTML emisem generated server side, so I could generate one of the two layouts depending on the window width, but then it wouldnt respond to a window resize.p  pIm not against a little Javascript, but in this case, to translate the first table into the second on a window resize, it would need to be taken apart and rebuilt, cell by cell, and I think thats overkill.

Negative 2888 pIf I have a variable, number  255p  pHow do I go about inserting its binary value into a string exactly as it is in memory, not converting it into an ascii representation, as in 3 characters.p  pstring  my number is   number p  pSo in this case in memory would be the string as it is normally as ascii but where the variable is it would be just one byte and be 11111111. Again thats not 11111111 in ascii as in not 8 chars.p  pThe purpose of this is that ive been sending data through serial to my microcontroller but so far its all been in ascii, any numbers I send are converted to ascii, so 255 would be 3 bytes, but im trying to make everything a bit more efficient by sending any number as their raw binary value. At the moment no number that I need to send will be bigger than 255 so can be done in one bytep  pI understand that I will need to decide on an escape character if I go down this route so I dont accidentally represent a command symbol with my raw binary data but that isnt an issue. p  pEDIT Just mentioning that I know I have to encode my strings as ascii as python is unicode by default.

Negative 2888 pI am trying to inject two classes into my constructor, the problem they are both of the same interface. My registering isp  precodecontainer.RegisterTypeltITrackerSection, ScopeSectiongt container.RegisterTypeltITrackerSection, SampleSectiongt codepre  pAs you can see they are both of type emITrackerSectionem but have different implementations. My constructor looks as followsp  precodepublic TrackerEngineITrackerSection scopeSection, ITrackerSection sampleSection codepre  pBoth these parameters are injected as a sampleSection as it was last to be registered for the interface type. I have no problem with naming the registered types for examplep  precodecontainer.RegisterTypeltITrackerSection, ScopeSectiongtscopeSection container.RegisterTypeltITrackerSection, SampleSectiongtsampleSection codepre  pBut this now means I have to specify the classes parameters and that seems messy and adding dependency when unity is more than capable of resolving them. Furthermore the registering of the TrackerEngine would also need to specify the parameters. I know I could use an in line attribute in the constructor of TrackerEngine but I would prefer Unity to infer the objects by the names.p  pCan Unity I can not seem to get this working correctly inject the correct implementation of the interface purely from the name given to the parameter in the constructor So ITrackerSection scopeSection is the same name given in the registering of ScopeSection so use that type.p

I got   to work on the local environment but when I tried to put it on the testing Apache server I get an SSI error. And the weird thing is if I change it to  , it works fine on the testing Apache server but doesnt work on the local environment. I have a very basic understanding of this but am wondering if there is a reason virtual works locally but not on testing and file works on testing but not local. p

Negative 2888 pI am using MVC 5 to build a site that displays brackets for JuJitsu tournaments. The fighters are divided into divisions based on weight, but sometimes there are not enough fighters in a division and we have to combine them. To do this I created a CustomDivision model that holds multiple divisions. In the view that displays a list of the active divisions in a tournament I have a checkbox beside each division and a button that takes the checked divisions by id number which is the value of the checkbox. I have javascript that takes the tournament id, the array of division ids converted into a string, and prompts for a name. This all works just fine, I am able to print out the array values and name to a div which I do for testing, to see if I actually have the values, but the ajax .load is not working. The controller returns a partial view which is a series of  table cells to be inserted into the activeDivisions table in a  at the bottom with an id of custom. I have the script tags for jquery and jquery ajax on the page. I set a break point on the first line of the controller action and it was never hit, so the ajax call is not happening as far as I can tell. So, what I am doing wrong p  pHere is the script from the viewp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt function       combine.clickfunction event          var checkedBoxes  activeDivisions inputcheckboxchecked.mapfunction               return this.val         .get         var str           for i  0 i lt checkedBoxes.length i                      str  str     checkedBoxes[i]                  messages.appendstr  ltbrgt         var divName  promptEnter Division Name, Custom Division         messages.appenddivName  ltbrgt         var tourID  Model.TournamentID  should be var tourID  Model.TournamentID          var cgUrl  Url.ActionAddCustom, CustomGi         custom.loadcgUrl,                                                                   tour tourID,                                   name divName,                                   selectedDivs str                                ,                                alertajax call made                ltscriptgt codepre  pNote combine is the id of the button, messages is a div I created at the bottom of the page for testing, the controller is CustomGiController and the action name is AddCustom. The AddCustom controller takes three parameters, tour, name, and selectedDivs, all strings. I put the alert in there to see if the ajax call was occuring, but it never fires. The division ids and name are appended to messages, so that much is working.p  pOk I replaced the .load with .ajax, but it is still not working. I watch the network output in the developer tools in Firefox, and when I load the page I see all the scripts being downloaded, but when I press the combine button, nothing happens, so the ajax call is not being made for some reason. Here is the code I replaced the .load method withp  precode .ajax             url cgUrl,             type POST,             data                  tour tourID,                 name divName,                 selectedDivs str             ,             datatype HTML         .donefunction result  custom.appendresult          .alwaysalertajax call made codepre

Negative 2888 pI have a website that I host on a Linux VPS which has been growing over the years. One of its primary functions is to store imagesphotos and these image files are typically around 2040kB each. The way the site is organised at the moment is all images are stored in a root folder photos and under that root folder are many subfolders determined by a random filename. For example, one image could have a file name abcdef1234.jpg and that would be stored in the folder photosabcdef. The advantage of this is that there are no directories with excessive numbers of images in them and accessing files is quick. However, the entire photos directory is huge and is set to grow. I currently have almost half a million photos in tens of thousands of subfolders and whilst the system works fine, it is fairly cumbersome to back up. I need advice on what I could do to make life easier for backups. At the moment, I am backing up the entire photos directory each time and I do that by compressing the folder and downloading it. It takes a while and puts some strain on the server. I do this because every FTP client I use takes ages to sift through all the files and find the most recent ones by date. Also, I would like to be able to restore the entire photo set quickly in the event of a catastrophic webserver failure so even if I could back up the data recursively, how cumbersome would it be to have to upload each back stage by stagep  pDoes anyone have any suggestions perhaps from experience I am not a webserver administrator and my experience of Linux is very limited. I have also looked into CDNs and Amazon S3 but this would require a great deal of change to my site in order to make these system work  perhaps Ill use something like this in the future.p

I was hoping to be able to use 1 named range as the source for the chart, but so far, it is not working. p  pfor example my data range starts in cel A1 and expands one column at a time to the right. So now the range is A1E38. tomorrow it is A1F38 etc.p  pSo I created a named range with this formula and tried to use it as the source for the chartp  pcodeOFFSETontwikkeling puntenA100COUNTAontwikkeling puntenAACOUNTAontwikkeling punten221codep  pBut excel does not accept this a the data source for my chart. When I select the current range, say A1E38, and create a chart from it, there is no problem at all. Why does excel not accept my dynamic named range as the source for my chartp  pOtherwise, I would have to create 38 separate data ranges.p

Negative 2888 h1Summaryh1  pIm trying to find the bounding box of a shape that is transformed between to transformation anchors. The goal is to encapsulate an animation of a rectangle so that none of the rectangle is ever outside the rendered area. I am using these three java classesp  ul lijava.awt.Rectangleli lijava.awt.geom.AffineTransformli liAnchor custom class li ul  h1Currently What I Haveh1  pHeres how the anchor class is definedp  precodepublic class Anchor    public double deltaX  0, deltaY  0   public double scaleX  1, scaleY  1   public double degrees  0  codepre  pIn my real application, I have a set of anchors that are attached to a time, and as the animation progresses the shape is interpolated between the two neighboring Anchors. But for this question we only need to worry about 2 Anchors.p  pHeres a crude, mostly working implementation of what I want, but I feel like there must be a more accurate, efficient mathematical approach.

I could find the bounding box by simply adding the resulting bounding box of the left anchors AffineTransform and the right anchors AffineTransform. However, with rotation the points of the animated rectangle can escape these more easily found bounding boxes.p  pPS To you C programmers, I apologise for my verboseness in my code...p

Negative 2888 pHello I am currently making a very simple game with c and opengl but having no idea what part of my program is making an error in windows xp and 8. It works so fine in my windows 7.p  pThe compilation is done by visual studio 6.0. I in most cases use GCC in mingw but I found that the one compiled with GCC keeps making some unexpected white tears as in teartoretorn in the screen while dealing with opengl.p  pAnyway this program runs with no problem in windows 7. I was little worried about the mallocfrees, but as far as it seems, it is doing very well.p  pI tested this program with my friends computers in windows xp and 8.1 and found that in both it does not run well. I installed another visual studio 6.0 in an xp computer and ran debug. Surprisingly, while the visual studio in win7 did not, the xp vs6.0 told me Unhandled exception in XXXX.exe OPENGL32.DLL 0xC0000005 Acces Violation, with the disassembled code as follows err is where

Negative 2888 pI have a function that is recursively searching through a general tree not BST to find a specific Node, but it is not working properly. Each Node has an array of pointers to Nodes children and the default is set to 3 children for each Node. I know this is not the best way to do this but its part of an assignment. This function gets called by an insert function. The insert function gets passed in the name of the parent and then the find function finds the Node for that parent and returns it the insert function then inserts the new child at that parent. p  pIt seems to be working in most cases but for one of the new children the wrong node is returned by the find function. I walked through the debugger and it finds the matching parent name and returns like it is supposed to but then by the time it gets all the way back to the insert function where it was called from it is pointing to a different Node not the one it originally found that was a matchp  precodeFinds the name of the parent that is passed in and inserts a new node as a child of      that parent void TreeTreechar name,char desc,int level,char parentName      find the parent     Node location  FindLocparentName, root      the parent was found     iflocation              int index  0          whilelocationgtchild[index] ampamp index  1 lt childmax             index          iflocationgtchild[index]                      locationgtchild[index]  new Node             location  locationgtchild[index]             locationgtdata.SetNamename             locationgtdata.SetDescdesc             locationgtdata.SetLevellevel                    else         coutltlt Parent not foundltltendl    Finds the parent of the new child to be added to the tree TreeNode TreeFindLocchar parentName, Node root      Node temp  NULL     ifroot              ifstrcmpparentName, rootgtdata.GetName  0             return root         else                      forint i  0 i lt childmax ampamp rootgtchild[i] i                 temp  FindLocparentName, rootgtchild[i]              iftemp return temp                    else return temp  codepre

It pulls from distinct methods including basic life coaching, spiritually aimed inquiry, psyche integration, shadow work and more.  p  pThe epic potential of this app is only discovered after using it for a month or so, because it lies in the radically unpredictable potential lying in the intersection of these methods and general aims.  p  pAs of right now, it will help me identify emotions that might be otherwise repressed, welcome them, identify resistance to such, welcome that, let that go, and explore what arises then... in perpetuity like a zen master or counselor or mens group facilitator might do... BUT that process is also radically relevant to other aims... say visioning, or healing a relationship wound, or processing through resistance to being fiscally grounded and generous, for example.  p  pAs of right now the only way to integrate the two tools together is to flip back and forth in the tab bar, which aint bad, but which requires me to step out of the process and facilitate it, and the more I can eliminate that the deeper I can go into the experience... p  pSO... I need to be able to take one storyboard track or path, and to combine it with another, in tandem... side by side... and I need to know if the split view controller in Xcode 5 enables such a phenomena to occur.  If not, does anythingp  pI could build this out by hand but seriously, it would be a massive unnecessary undertaking if such a thing were possible... to simply split the view, and have one storyboard sequence flow through one half of the view while the other storyboard sequence chills out, and then is taken back up, and then chills out... p  pYou see what I mean  One storyboard might ask me to heal my relationship with money, which if I am broke, is gonna bring up a TON of resistance, which the other storyboard sequence can process and clear... if they are both available in tandem. p  pHelp me out here p  pAlso, this app is available to beta testers if you wanna get an experience of what I am talking about...

I need to set up BASIC conditionality.... if someone hits x button, it switches to mode 2, if again, mode 3... its a single button, across the app... that switches modes and reloads the correlative page...  so if it asks a question in a way that doesnt work for you, you can switch styles and get it asked a different way, but then the ENTIRE process evolves in its style to mode B or C, etc, such that all of the questions to come are in the new style until you switch it again... p  pI know, this is probably BASIC conditionality, but where does it fit into the app  Is there a guide for this  Basic conditionality functionality  Is this related to the view controller actions function  Steer me in the right directionp

The reason we do not use the SDK is that we want to take advantage of the batch operation which is only available in the RESTAPI. p  precode   requests [            body          isFriable false,         haDetail ,         sizeOther ,         colourOther ,         texture ,         fieldInspection            type Pointer,           className FieldInspection,           objectId YS5bXHBwDu         ,         surfaceSubType            type Pointer,           className SurfaceSubType,           objectId d4IL5k1pv5         ,         size            type Pointer,           className HomogenousMaterialSize,           objectId ezr3uHDUvt         ,         colour            type Pointer,           className HomogenousMaterialColour,           objectId NqYXJcOkPE                ,       method POST,       path 1classesHomogenousArea        ]  codepre  pThe above is my request. This gets pushed to a hrefhttpsapi.parse.com1batch relnofollowhttpsapi.parse.com1batcha using a basic default HttpClient. p  pWhen we execute the HTTP request it sometimes just hangs, it does not return any result. Roughly one in every 5 or 6 requests does this. The exact same data on a subsequent request that succeeds will go through fine. The problem is that at that point we have duplicate records persisted to Parse as our sync logic never completed since we did not get a response. p  pIs there anything in Parse we can use to debug requests like this Below is the current http client implementation we are using. NOTE Also put in OkHttp from Square and hit the exact same issue. p  precode         Instantiate the http client to make the batch request         DefaultHttpClient httpClient  new DefaultHttpClient         HttpPost post  setupHttpPosturl           Assign the data to the post         StringEntity entity  new StringEntityinsertData         post.setEntityentity           Setup the response handler         ResponseHandler response  new BasicResponseHandler           Make the call to Post the new data         Object rersponse  httpClient.executepost, response         if rersponse  null              return rersponse.toString                      return null codepre
Negative 2888 pMy problem lies in the next. I have a javascript application. It utilises the so called module pattern. That is I have multiple js files one for each class and during the build process all these files are put to a single file and wrapped in the IIFE. So in my karma config file I specifyp  precodefiles [src.js, tests.js] codepre  pThe problem arises because I need to use several modules in this app. Here is the example of the tree structure of the codep  precode     karmaunit.conf.js  src   Bar    module.js   Foo       module.js  tests      unit          Bar           test.js          Foo              test.js codepre  pSo I have two codeModulecode classes at the same time. This is not the problem with the built code. But for the unit tests this is the problem, because this is the name conflict. p  pI know that I can have different config files for each such a module and run tests several times one per a single config file, but this is very undesirable.p  pAlso I supposed that files are executed with respect to their inclusion order, so I tried to write in the config filep  precodefiles [     srcFoo.js,     testsFoo.js,     srcBar.js,     testsBar.js, ] codepre  pBut this did not help.p  pSo my question is how can I circumvent this situation when Im forced to have several javascript classes with the same name in a single project without running tests several times or renaming these classesp  pMy appreciation in advance.p

Negative 2888 pIm attempting to optimize rendering of a searchable Backbone Collection that is rendered on the page.  My goal is to display cached searches to the user as fast as possible so that it prevents noticible lag while they are typing. p  pWhile my current solution uses setTimout to asynchrousuly display rendered items in the view, it becomes troublesome to render the full collection again once the user erases all of the text in the search box i.e., render 600 items.  p  pSo for example, my initial render on page load is the followingp  precoderender functioncollection      this.elhtml  []      this.el.html     collection  collection  this.collection      if collection.length gt 0          functionthat              collection.eachfunctionitem                  that.renderItemHtmlitem                      this          this.el.htmlthis.elhtml      else          this.el.htmlnoItemsTemplate.html           return this , codepre  pAnd instead of appending an item to the current view for optimizations, I just grab the html in my renderItemHtmlp  precode renderItemHtml functionitem      var itemView  new this.itemView         model item          this.elhtml.pushitemView.render.el , codepre  pAfter my views are drawn and the user performs a search, I use the following render instead to avoid the previously aforementioned UI lagp  precoderenderFiltered functioncollection      var numActiveItems  0,         totalItems  0,         numItemsDisplayed  0      collection  collection  this.collection     collection.comparator  name     collection.sort      get the total number of active items     numActiveItems  this.collection.where         active true     .length     totalItems  numActiveItems     numItemsDisplayed  collection.toArray.length     if collection.length  this.collection.length          return this          this.el.html     if numItemsDisplayed lt totalItems          this.el.appendltdivgtDisplaying   numItemsDisplayed   out of   totalItems  ltdivgt           if collection.length gt 0          this.searchNum         this.renderItemscollection.models, 0, this.searchNum       codepre  pAnd each of these views are asynchronously added like sop  precoderenderItem functionitem      var itemView  new this.itemView         model item           this.el.appenditemView.render.el , codepre  pNow, the performance hit is not TOO bad when performing searches because those collections only have a length of 400 max on average.  But my concern is when rendereing larger collections.p  pSo my question  Is it possible to cache the rendered views el and when you are to display results for that search a second time through, set the views el to the cached element  Ive successfully done this by caching the HTML, but not the events attached to each of the models that are supposed to be rendered in the collection.  p  pWhen I render the cached collection using something likep  precodethis.el.replaceWiththis.cache[searchquery].el codepre  pthe resulting html content of this.el does not display what was stored in the cached element, but the previously rendered list...even though the cached element seems to have all of the outerHTML that it originally had and even the events when viewing through debugger.p  pHowever, the following renders perfectly, but the individual item views events are missingp  precodethis.el.appendthis.cache[searchquery].el codepre  pAlso, this.delegateEvents seems to only target the current view i.e., my library view and not the individual items.p  pIs there any method that you may recommend for caching rendered filtered elements and rerendering them with events still in placep  pPlease let me know if you need any more codeinfo.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2888 pWe have a problem with a contentsidebar layout which breaks down to the following. p  pWe have four divs, A, B, C and D. A and C have text and images  content  and should be placed on the left. B and D are lists of links, search forms, etc.  sidebar widgets  and should be placed on the right.p  pThe divs have to appear in the order A, B, C, D in the HTML, because wed like that to be the order on small screens. Like this, a set of quick links from the sidebar appears almost at the top, and the user doesnt have to scroll all the way down for that.p  pHowever, this gives us a problem with positioning on larger screens where we have a sidebar. Because the height of div B is lower than the height of div A, and div D has to come emafterem div C, div D is positioned too low. See it for yourself in the below snippet. Wed like to have div D starting directly below div B.p  pWe know the exact height of div A, but the other divs are flexible. The width of all divs is given. Is there a pure CSS way to make these divs position nicely Wed rather not use JavaScript if not necessary. Naturally, this has to work crossbrowser.p  pI thought about using CSS columns, but I need the sidebar to be less wide.p  pIf there is a way to change the order of the elements for different screen sizes, that would work to.

In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative simple behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding remote branch that git pull uses to update the current branch.  See git help config and search for push.default for further information. the simple mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11.

Negative 2888 pI have looked through many articles and tried various approaches for this. The application I am working on allows the user to select a language from the dropdown. Now, we are basing date formats and such based on the browser language rather than the language the user selected.p  pThis is what I have triedp  precodevar browserCulture  CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCultureRequest.UserLanguages[0] codepre  pThis will give me the correct culture, only if the user has their display language at the top of their language list in chrome. Lets say I have a list of accepted languages in chrome such as [English,Spanish,French]. I can choose to use spanish as the display language  without having to move it to the top of the list. In this case, the above code would produce an invalid result.p  pFurthermore, I also tried these approachesp  precodevar currentUI  Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture var acceptHeaders  Request.ServerVariables[HTTPACCEPTLANGUAGE] codepre  pThe current UI culture ends up being the language which the user chose in the application since it is what is being used to resolve the Resource File to use. Therefore I cannot use this one as the user may have the browser to display in another language. On the other hand, the accept headers produces the same list in the same order as Request.UserLanguages, so that also has the possibility of producing an invalid result.p  pI know the extra language selection that is available in the application should be persistant accross the board without using the browser culture but it is the way the design was brought up. It will be much appreciated if there is any input on an approach I can take to achieve this.p  pAlso, the main reason I need the language from the browser is so I can get the culture and have the ability to parse date strings on the server side. I am successfully displaying dates and formatting date inputs on the client side. The problem is when the dates come in as a string to the server, I need to know what format they are in so i can correctly parse them.p

Negative 2888 pI need the average of the codenClosecode smallest values except the first zero in a vector with codencode elements where we know that codenClose  1 lt ncode, there are only nonnegative numbers, and the vector contains at least one zero value. Furthermore, codenClosecode will be a lot smaller than codencode, say that nClose will be around 10 and n will be around 500.p  pNormally I will use codeminelementcode to find the minimum, however this is useless here since I need several values. At the moment I use the following codep  precodesortdiff.begin, diff.end double sum  accumulatediff.begin  1, diff.begin  1  nClose, 0 double avg  sum  nClose codepre  pDue to the sort it runs in On log n where we can do it in OnClosen by just find the minimum and remove it, then repeat this for nClose times. Know one of you how to accomplish this with the algorithms of c11p

Negative 2888 pI want to find a way to build a custom codepandas.tseries.offsetscode class at 1 second frequency for trading hours.

Negative 2888 pI am setting up a database using MySQL with the goal of storing data for a potentially large number of unique users. Each user will have some basic data associated with them  a unique username, when they joined the service, how many times they have used the service, in addition to a set of their personal preferences. I am planning on keeping one table called Users dedicated to these fields. p  pHowever, there is a bunch of data with a specific schema that will be collected about that user during each session that they use the service. This data includes which user performed this session, the date of the session, what the user did, etc.p  pMy thought process is the following if I use a single table for users that includes data on each of their sessions, this seems inefficient because there would have to be either a column for each unique session, or a column containing more or less an array or list of sessions. If I wanted to keep this data for an indeterminate number of sessions, then the onepercolumn idea would break down, because I believe there is a column limit. Updating an array within a single column also seems to be frowned upon, I think for reasons having to do with preserving the integrity of the data and maintaining the best possible organization.p  pSo it seems like I want two tables, one for users, and another for sessions. Every time anybody completes a session, data about that session will be created as a new row in the Sessions table, and each row would also have a foreign key linking that session to the particular user who completed it.p  pIs this a correct line of thought If not, how should I think about thisp  pThanksp

Negative 2888 pIve written an Excel VBA macro to paste some data into an AngularJS form  it opens an Internet Explorer 11 window, navigates to the page containing the form, and crawls the document tree looking for certain  elements by their ID, changing their values from blank to nonblank strings from the Excel sheet. However, when I submit the form, the form logic treats all the required fields as if they were still blank, drawing a red box around the supposed offending fields. I can intervene at this point by clicking into each field, typing a random character at the end of the pasted data and immediately deleting it, and this triggers the logic that the required field is now filled.p  pIm not a javascript programmer and didnt design the form nor can I change it in any way. I can manipulate the DOM elements focusing and blurring the fields, for example, though that doesnt seem to work, and I can probably run any command that could be entered into the console in the browser debugger. Would any AngularJS expert know a relatively simple way to force the form to check itselfp

Negative 2888 pIm using SQL Server Management Studio 2008 for query creation.  Reporting Services 2008 for report creation.p  pI have been trying to work this out over a couple of weeks and I have hit a brick wall.  Im hoping someone will be able to come up with the solution as right now my brain has turned to mush.p  pI am currently developing an SQL query that will be feeding data through to a Reporting Services report.  The aim of the report is to show the percentage of availability for first aid providers within locations around the county we are based in.  The idea is that there should be only one first aider providing cover at a time at each of our 20 locations.p  pThis has all been working fine apart from the first aiders at one location have been overlapping their cover at the start and end of each period of cover.  p  pExample of cover overlapp  pre  Location      startdate            enddate          Wick      22062015 090000  22062015 190000   Wick      22062015 183000  23062015 090000   Wick      23062015 090000  23062015 183000   Wick      23062015 180000  24062015 090000   pre  pIn a perfect world the database that they set their cover in wouldnt allow them to do this but its an externally developed database that doesnt allow us to make changes like that to it.  We also arent allowed to create functions, stored procedures, tally tables etcp  pThe query itself should return the number of minutes that each location has had first aid cover for, then broken down into hours of the day. Any overlap in cover shouldnt end up adding additional cover and should be merged.  One person can be on at a time, if they overlap then it should only count as one person lot of cover.  p  pExample Outputp  pre   Location        fromDt                toDt          TimeDiff  Availability   DayN   DayNo  Hour  DayCount    WicK      22062015 180000  22062015 185959        59           100  Monday      1    18         0   WicK      22062015 183000  22062015 185959        29            50  Monday      1    18         0   WicK      22062015 190000  22062015 195959        59           100  Monday      1    19         0   pre  pExample Codep  precode    DECLARE         StartTime datetime,         EndTime datetime,        GivenDate datetime     SET GivenDate  20150622   SET StartTime  GivenDate   000000   SET EndTime  20150623   235959   Declare Sample Table  Location Varchar50, StartDate Datetime, EndDate Datetime   Insert Sample  Select sta.location, act.Start, act.END  from emp, con, sta, act  where  emp.ID  con.ID and con.location  sta.location and SUBSTRINGsta.ident,3,2 in 51,22 and convertvarchar10,act.start,111 between GivenDate and EndTime and act.ACT 18 group by sta.location, act.Start, act.END order by 2  WITH Yak location, fromDt, toDt, maxDt,hourdiff  AS   SELECT location,  StartDate,  check if the period of cover rolls onto the next hour      convertdatetime,convertvarchar21,     CONVERTvarchar10,StartDate,111      convertvarchar2,dateparthour,StartDate5959 , EndDate ,dateaddhour,1,dateaddhour, datediffhour, 0, StartDate, 0StartDate FROM Sample  UNION ALL   SELECT location,  dateaddsecond,1,toDt,  dateaddhour, 1, toDt, maxDt, hourdiff  FROM Yak  WHERE toDt lt maxDt   ,  TAB1 location, FROMDATE,TODATE1,TODATE AS SELECT location, StartTime, convertdatetime,convertvarchar21,         CONVERTvarchar10,StartTime,120          convertvarchar2,dateparthour,StartTime5959.999, EndTime   from Sample  UNION ALL SELECT  location, DATEADDhour, 1,convertdatetime,convertvarchar21,         CONVERTvarchar10,FROMDATE,120          convertvarchar2,dateparthour,FROMDATE0000.000ToDate, DATEADDhour, 1,convertdatetime,convertvarchar21,         CONVERTvarchar10,TODATE1,120          convertvarchar2,dateparthour,TODATE15959.999 Todate1, TODATE FROM TAB1 WHERE TODATE1 lt TODATE , CTE Tab2 adds zero values to all possible hours between start and end dates  TAB2 AS SELECT location, FROMDATE, CASE WHEN TODATE1 gt TODATE THEN TODATE ELSE TODATE1 END AS TODATE FROM TAB1  SELECT location,  fromDt,   Display MaxDT as start time if cover period goes into next dat  CASE WHEN toDt gt maxDt THEN maxDt ELSE toDt END AS toDt,  If the end date is on the next day find out the minutes between the start date and the end of the day or find out the minutes between the next day and the end date  Case When ToDt gt Maxdt then datediffmi,fromDt,maxDt else datediffmi,FromDt,ToDt end as TimeDiff, Case When ToDt gt Maxdt then rounddatediffS,fromDt,maxDt3600.0100,0 else rounddatediffS,FromDt,ToDt3600.0100.0,0 end as Availability, Display the name of the day of the week CASE WHEN toDt gt maxDt THEN datenamedw,maxDt ELSE datenamedw,fromDt END AS DayN, CASE WHEN toDt gt maxDt THEN case when datepartdw,maxDt1  0 then 7 else datepartdw,maxDt1 end  ELSE case when datepartdw,fromDt1  0 then 7 else  datepartdw,fromDt1 END  end AS DayNo ,DATEPARThour, fromDt as Hour, 0 as DayCount FROM Yak  where Case When ToDt gt Maxdt then datediffmi,fromDt,maxDt else datediffmi,FromDt,ToDt end ltgt 0  group by location,fromDt,maxDt,toDt  Union all  SELECT tab2.location,  convertvarchar19,Tab2.FROMDATE,120, convertvarchar19,Tab2.TODATE,120, 0, 0, datenamedw,FromDate DayN, case when datepartdw,FromDate1  0 then 7 else datepartdw,FromDate1 end AS DayNo, DATEPARThour, fromDate as Hour, COUNTdistinct datenamedw,fromDate FROM TAB2  Where datediffMINUTE,convertvarchar19,Tab2.FROMDATE,120,convertvarchar19,Tab2.TODATE,120 gt 0  group by location, TODATE, FROMDATE   Order by 2  option maxrecursion 0 codepre  pI have tried the following forum entries but they havent worked in my case a hrefhttpforums.teradata.comforumgeneralneedhelpmergingconsecutiveandoverlappingdatespans relnofollowhttpforums.teradata.comforumgeneralneedhelpmergingconsecutiveandoverlappingdatespansap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions781895checkingfortimerangeoverlapthewatchmanproblemsqlChecking for time range overlap, the watchman problem [SQL]ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27611687calculateactualdowntimeignoringoverlapindatestimesCalculate Actual Downtime ignoring overlap in datestimesap  pSorry for being so lengthy but I thought I would try to give you as much detail as possible.

I tried Phing, but that failed but lead me to a hrefhttpswww.phing.infotracticket956 relnofollowthis Phing ticketa, so Im not alone  but that solution using codeattribcode didnt work for me. p  pI finally realised that it was just taking two attempts to delete some folders andor files within it.

For Example the templatetag p calls a method in my application with the parameter of the tagvalue. strongppropvalstrong is a equivalent to strongmyApp.getPropertypropvalstrongp  pOther tags call other methods of my application. I am thinking about using a string.replace with a regular expression for my tags. But i run into two problemsp  ol liHow to write this regular expressionli liHow to handle nonstring return valuesli ol  pthe evaluated value of a tag must not always be a string. it could also be a more complex data type like an array or json object. In my first example code at the top of this question the resulting value for ppropnameA could be an array like [1,2,3,4]. Or ppropnameB could be a number and so my example on top should evaluate likep  precodeobj     prop [1, 2, 3, 4],   secondprop 827,   thirdprop Hello, this is valueC and valueD,   arr [textvalue, propE value  827]  codepre  pobviously obj.secondprop should not have the string value 827 but the number instead while obj.arr[1] should be a string.p  pDo you got some smart ideas how to do this Thank you very much for any helpp

Negative 2888 pFirst time copying my test database from work database to live.  I used Visual Studio to design my website, my database is a SQL 2008 database, and I publish to IIS.p  pSecurity worked fine on my test website  the website asked for user id and password the first time I log on  using Windows authentication Integrated Security SSPI.  I copied my website to same server with Visual Studio, my SQL database to a new SQL Server, and published it to IIS on a new web server, keeping all the same settings. Now, with the new settings, any user can open the website  it does not ask for user id and password.  The website works correctly  the security just isnt working. Heres exactly how I copiedp  pI copied my Visual Studio project timework  work copy to timework on janetdev server.br I copied my SQL database TimeSQL on janetdev to TimeSQL on to the new SQL server.

I went to the new IIS server and imported the new project into IIS.  I double checked all the settings in IIS on old janetdev to make sure that they were the same on the new server. p  pWhat could I be missing  Why can anyone get into the new website  The only thing I could think of is that everything VS project, SQL database, and IIS was on one server before.  Now, they are all on different servers.  One other thing  SQL was 2008 R2 on the test server, and its 2008 on the new server.  Not sure if that could cause a problem.

Negative 2888 pI made a custom launcher with GridView and adapter.I added a CAB which turns on with a long press on an icon. When the CAB is opened and Im in the action mode I want to implement onItemLongClickListener to the gridView and make a drag and drop I want to enable rearanging of icons.

Negative 2888 pI have been trying to figure this out for the past two hours I have performed all the steps necessary to initialize Push notifications, yet am unable to receive even the test notification. p  pOn my apps dashboard, I do see a class named Installation, which contains the object Id of the user. p  pIf I try to send a push notification to all devices, it shows up in the push log, but nothing registers on the device. p  pTo remedy this problem , I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app in the emulator, cleaning the project, restarting android studio and logging as a different user when I send the test notification, another device was registered in the Installation class. Nothing has worked.

It works fine except for this one problem if I clicked on the save button, since the codeTextFieldcode looses focus, the custom field gets removed.p  pIf I can add a blur listener to the codeHorizontalLayoutcode in which both the codeTextFieldcode and codeButtoncode contains, this would get resolved.
