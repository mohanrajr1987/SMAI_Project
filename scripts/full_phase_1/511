Positive 511 pcodempmeventcode is like codempmworkercode except that codempmeventcode manages all nonSSL KeepAlive connections with a separate, dedicated thread rather than having each thread manage each individual connection.  By giving and then keeping a dedicated thread for each KeepAlive connection, codempmworkercode leaves that thread and its resources bound to that connection regardless of whether or not a request is being processed. codempmeventcode on the other hand, can lower system resource use in high concurrency environments by allowing the thread and its resources to be recycled back to the system once requests are complete.p  pIt seems to me that in high concurrency, nonSSL environments where KeepAlive has long timeouts, codempmeventcode has the potential to make for a system that can handle a higher workload with equivalent resources than a system with the same resorces using codempmworkercode. strongemMore importantly, it seems to me that in terms of resource use and features, codempmeventcode is at least as good as codempmworkercode, if not better, in all circumstances.emstrongp  pDespite my understanding that codempmeventcode is always at least as good and possibly better, my favorite Linux distributions default to using codempmworkercode when installing Apache 2.4 from the repositories.

Positive 511 pI spent last year studying the actor model, but in the last month I was curious about the Go language, so read about it also.p  pBoth the concurrency model helps to scale an application, but with my previous experience I cant find a case where the goroutines are better than the actor model.p  pWhen I read about goroutine I think that everything is done with a goroutine can be done also with actors, but the opposite isnt true or at least you cant do it easily, so this let me think that I didnt get the goroutine right. I always developed web application, and I think this block me to think about some problems for which the goroutine can do better than the actor model.p  pI would like to know for which use case using a goroutine is better than an actor.p

Positive 511 pI have a class where I keep references to a set of codeNSManagedObjectcode in an array. Such managed objects belong to which I call my codemainContextcode, that is associated to main thread.p  pTo update such objects, I call several web services, and I create new managed objects with the information I get from them. I insert those new objects in a context I call codeprivateContextcode that is associated to a private queue.

Positive 511 pGood morning all,p  pI am trying to implement concurrency in a very specific environment, and keep getting stuck. Maybe you can help me.p  pthis is the situationp  pI have N nodes that can readwrite in a shared folder. p  pI want to execute an application in one of them. this can be anything, like a shell script, an installed code, or whatever. p  pTo do so, I have to send the same command to all of them. The first one should start the execution, and the rest should see that somebody else is running the desired application and exit.p  pThe execution of the application can be killed at any time. This is important because does not allow  relying on any cleaning step after the execution. p  pif the application gets killed, the user may want to execute it again. He would then send the very same command. p  pMy current approach is to create a shell script that wraps the command to be executed. This could also be implemented in C. Not python or other languages, to avoid library dependencies. p  precodebinsh  folder structure simplified for legibility mutex   lockdir.lock   firstTask1 false    if mkdir lockdir  ampgt devnull   then     controlFilecontrolFile      if this is the first node, start coordinator     if [  f controlFile ] then       firstTask0 true       tell the rest of nodes that I am in control       echo some info gt controlFile      fi        remove control File when script finishes      trap rm controlFile EXIT   fi   return firstTask    The basic idea is that a task executes the desire command, stated as arguments to this script. The rest do nothing if   mutex  then   exit 0 fi  I am the first node and the only one reaching this, so I execute whatever  codepre  pIf there are no failures, this wrapper works great.  The problem is that, if the script is killed before the execution, the trap is not executed and the control file is not removed. Then, when we execute the wrapper again to restart the task, it wont work as every node will think that somebody else is running the application. p  pA possible solution would be to remove the control script just before the  call, but that it would lead to some race condition. p  pAny suggestion or ideap  pThanks for your help.p  pstrongeditstrong edited with correct solution as future referencep

The idea being that any number of males can use the bathroom if there are no females, and similarly any number of females can use the bathroom if there are no males.p  pSo given that this is a multithreaded program Im wondering if the parameter codeNode malecode will be unique for each thread While trying to acquire the lock we first check if we are the head of the queue and that there are no females currently using the bathroom, if this is true than we may enter the critical section, otherwise we wait.p  pIm wondering if once the thread is reawakened after the codeMonitor.Waitcode statement will the codeNodecode instance be the expected object, or could it possibly reference one of the threads that invoked the method and is currently stuck at codeMonitor.Waitcode I dont want a thread seeing that the condition coderesult  malecode be true if the currently executing thread is codeThread 1code while the thread referenced by codemalecode is in fact codeThread 2code.p  precodepublic void EnterMaleNode male              Monitor.EnterbathroomLock         bathroomQueue.Enqueuemale         Node result         bathroomQueue.TryPeekout result         while result  male  numOfFemales gt 0                      Monitor.WaitbathroomLock             bathroomQueue.TryPeekout result                  numOfMales         Remove self from queue         bathroomQueue.TryDequeueout result         Wake up next person in line         need to own lock for this or exception gets thrown         Monitor.PulseAllbathroomLock         Enter critical section         Monitor.ExitbathroomLock        public void LeaveMale              numOfMales         Wake up next person in line         need to own lock for this or exception gets thrown         lock bathroomLock             Monitor.PulseAllbathroomLock      codepre
Positive 511 pI am doubt with that , in Java language, we need hold the lock, before we await some condition to be satisfied.p  pfor example, int java monitor lockp  precodesynchronizedlock    System.out.printlnbefore lock ...    lock.wait    System.out.printlnafter lock ...  codepre  por the cucurrent utils.p  precodeLock lock  new ReentrantLock Condition cond  lock.newCondition  lock.lock try      System.out.printlnbefore condition ...      cond.await      System.out.printlnafter condition ... catchException e      e.printStackTrace finally      lock.unlock  codepre  pso, why we cant await, without hold the lock p  pif that just because of Java, other language works differ p  pI hope you can explain the reason after the design, but not only for JAVASPEC definition. p

Positive 511 pSo Im having some trouble figuring out best practices for using concurrency with a MongoDB in go. My first implementation of getting a session looked like thisp  precodevar globalSession mgo.Session  func getSession mgo.Session, error      Establish our database connection     if globalSession  nil          var err error         globalSession, err  mgo.Dial27017         if err  nil              return nil, err                   Optional. Switch the session to a monotonic behavior.         globalSession.SetModemgo.Monotonic, true           return globalSession.Copy, nil  codepre  pThis works great the trouble Im running into is that mongo has a limit of 204 connections then it starts refusing connections codeconnection refused because too many open connections 204codehowever, the issue is since Im calling codesession.Copycode it only returns a session and not an error. So event though the connection refused my program never thrown an error.p  pNow what I though about doing is just having one session and using that instead of copy so I can have access to a connection error like sop  precodevar session mgo.Session  nil  func NewSession mgo.Session, error      if session  nil          session, err  mgo.Dialurl         if err  nil              return nil, err                    return session, nil  codepre  pNow the problem I have with this is that I dont know what would happen if I try to make concurrent usage of that same session. p
Positive 511 h2Application Setup simplifiedh2  pI feel like I am pretty familiar with concurrency in Java, but I am relatively new to Java EE and its annotations.p  pI have a class called codeDataHandlercode annotated with codeSingletoncode that performs some business logic for my application. This class is injected into a web service implementation class annotated with codeWebServicecode. When one of the web services methods is called, codeDataHandlercode calls the codeparseFilescode method which parses some files, and stores data inside of codeDataHandlercode. Afterwards it makes some calls to getters inside of codeDataHandlercodep  precodeWebServiceportName  portName,     serviceName  MyService,     endpointInterface  com.myco.MyPortType,     wsdlLocation  WEBINFwsdlMyWSDL.wsdl,     targetNamespace  targetNamespace public class MyServiceImpl implements MyPortType   EJB private DataHandler dataHandler  Override public ResponseType doStuffRequestType request       code      ....     dataHandler.parseFiles      ....      more code     MapltString, CustomTypegt map  dataHandler.getCustomTypeMap     MapltString, CustomType2gt map2  dataHandler.getCustomType2Map  codepre  pNow I also have messagedriven bean that receives some data on a topic called UpdateTopic, then converts it into another type and stores it inside of codeDataHandlercodep  precodeMessageDrivenactivationConfig       ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  acknowledgeMode, propertyValue  Autoacknowledge,     ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  destinationType, propertyValue  javax.jms.Topic,     ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  destination, propertyValue  UpdateTopic  public class UpdateTopicMDB implements MessageListener   EJB DataHandler dataHandler  Override public void onMessageMessage message      try          if message instanceof ObjectMessage              ObjectMessage objMessage  ObjectMessage message             Serializable data  objMessage.getObject             if data instanceof UpdateType                  dataHandler.convertAndStoreUpdateType data                            catchException e           log Exception       codepre  pI wanted to synchronize the codeparseFilescode method, the codeconvertAndStorecode method, and the two getters so that all data would be uptodate when accessed.p  pI simply made all four methods codesynchronizedcode to achieve this. My understanding is that if the files were in the middle of being parsed and an update comes into the MDB, then the codeconvertAndStorecode method would be locked until codeparseFilescode is done. Likewise, if an update is being converted and stored and the web service is trying to access one of the two maps, it will wait until codeconvertAndStorecode is finished. Correct me if Im wrong on any of that.p  hr  h2My Questionh2  pWith all of that being said, I just recently read about the codeConcurrencyManagementcode and codeLockcode annotations. Instead of synchronizing these four methods. It now seems as though I should just annotate codeparseFilescode and codeconvertAndStorecode with codeLockLockType.WRITEcode since they are modifying the beans state and the two getters with codeLockLockType.READcode.p  pShould I do this and avoid using the codesynchronizedcode keyword altogether Would there be any use for codesynchronizedcode maybe just for synchronized blocks, or do these annotations replace it nowp

Positive 511 pI am fairly new with Akka framework and Concurrency concepts. And from Akka docs, I understood that only one message in the Actor mailbox would be processed at a time. So single thread would be processing Actors state at a time. And my doubt is that, so declaring an Actor statedata variable as mutable  VarOnly when Val doesnt fit, will not cause inconsistent Actor states in the case of Concurrency. I am using Scala for development. In the following Master actor, details of workers is stored in a mutable variable workers.

Positive 511 pThe requirement is that, I need to write an ArrayList of integers. I need threadsafe access of the different integers write, read, increase, decrease, and also need to allow maximum concurrency.p  pThe operation with each integer is also special, like this  Mostly frequent operation is to read  Secondly frequent operation is to decrease by one only if the value is greater than zero. Or, to increase by one unconditionally  Addingremoving elements is rare, but still needed.p  pI thought about AtomicInteger. However this becomes unavailable, because the atomic operation I want is to compare if not zero, then decrease. However the atomic operation provided by AtomicInteger, is compare if equal, and set. If you know how to apply AtomicInteger in this case, please raise it here.p  pWhat I am thinking is to synchronized the access to each integer like this p  precodeArrayList ltIntegergt list  ... ...  Compare if greater than zero, and decrease Integer n  list.getindex boolean success  false synchronized n      if ngt0  n successtrue     To add one Integer n  list.getindex synchronized n      n    To just read, I am thinking no need synchronization at all. int n  list.getindex.intValue codepre  pWith my solution, is there any sideeffect Is it efficient to maintain hundreds or even thousands of synchronized integersp  pThen another thing is to implement the operation of adddelete, that it is threadsafe, but do not impact much of the concurrency of the other operations. I am thinking ReadWriteLock, for adddelete, need to acquire the write lock, for other operations change the value of one integer, acquire the read lock.  Is this a right approachp

So, the first consume cannot be done and the consumer thread is forced into waiting. However, this is not desired because the second consume100 should be executed right away.

Negative 511 pI have seen many resources here on SO about Sockets. I believe none of them covered the details which I wanted to know. In my application, server does all the processing and send periodic updates to the clients. p  pIntention of this post is to cover all the basic ideas required when developing a socket application and discuss the best practices. Here are the basic things that you will see with almost all socket based applications.p  p1  strongBinding and listening on a socketstrongp  pI am using the following code. It works well on my machine. Do I need to take care about something else when I deploy this on a real serverp  precodeIPHostEntry localHost  Dns.GetHostEntryDns.GetHostName IPEndPoint endPoint  new IPEndPointlocalHost.AddressList[0], 4444  serverSocket  new SocketendPoint.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream,                       ProtocolType.Tcp serverSocket.BindendPoint serverSocket.Listen10 codepre  p2  strongReceiving datastrongp  pI have used a 255 sized byte array. So when I am receiving data which is more than 255 bytes, I need to call the receive method until I get the full data, right Once I got the full data, I need to append all the bytes received so far to get the  full message. Is that correct Or is there a better approachp  p3  strongSending data and specifying the data lengthstrongp  pSince there is no way in TCP to find the length of the message to receive, I am planning to add the length to the message. This will be the first byte of the packet. So client systems knows how much data is available to read. p  pAny other better approachp  p4  strongClosing the clientstrongp  pWhen client is closed, it will send a message to server indicating the close. Server will remove the client details from its client list. Following is the code used at client side to disconnect the socket messaging part not shown.p  precodeclient.ShutdownSocketShutdown.Both client.Close codepre  pAny suggestions or problemsp  p5  strongClosing the serverstrongp  pServer sends message to all clients indicating the shutdown. Each client will disconnect the socket when it receives this message. Clients will send the close message to server and close. Once server receives close message from all the clients, it disconnects the socket and stop listening. Call emDisposeem on each client sockets to release the resources. Is that the correct approachp  p6  strongUnknown client disconnectionsstrongp  pSometimes, a client may disconnect without informing the server. My plan to handle this is When server sends messages to all clients, check the socket status. If it is not connected, remove that client from the client list and close the socket for that client. p  pAny help would be greatp

Negative 511 pI understand that, with a singleton situation, you can perform such an operation asp  precodespam  eggs codepre  pand if codespamcode and codeeggscode are instances of the same class with all the same attribute values, it will return codeTruecode.  In a Django model, this is natural because two separate instances of a model wont ever be the same unless they have the same code.pkcode value.p  pThe problem with this is that if a reference to an instance has attributes that have been updated by middleware somewhere along the way and it hasnt been saved, and youre trying to it to another variable holding a reference to an instance of the same model, it will return codeFalsecode of course because they have different values for some of the attributes. Obviously I dont need something like a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31875singletona , but Im wondering if there some official Djangonic ha, a new word method for checking this, or if I should simply check that the code.pkcode value is the same withp  precodespam.pk  eggs.pk codepre  pIm sorry if this was a huge waste of time, but it just seems like there might be a method for doing this, and something Im missing that Ill regret down the road if I dont find it.p  h2UPDATE 02272015h2  pYou should disregard the first part of this question, since you shouldnt compare singletons with codecode, but rather with codeiscode.

Negative 511 pI have an activity with a codeHorizontalScrollViewcode. When it opens, I start filling this view or rather, a container layout inside it with another views. This is done from another thread by using codehandler.postcode. p  pThe views are added in bunches of 15, and when there are no more views to add, I start updating them with new data this is a kind of streaming data from a server.p  pThe problem is that the scrollview is empty until all of the views are added.

Negative 511 pOkay, to give a little background, I learned WPF about 3 years ago and have kept reasonably up to date with whats happened since in various different versions.  I looked at and implemented MVVM on a couple of projects, had a good look at frameworks like Prism so I think Im pretty well versed in most areas of the framework.  Ive also worked briefly on a couple of small Silverlight 2.0 projects.p  pMy problem is this, Im about to start a Silverlight job at a new company and while Im very comfortable that I can do the job well, I feel like my WPF knowledge may cause me some issues.  Ive gone over the a hrefhttpwpfslguidance.codeplex.comWPFSilverlight guidance whitepapera on codeplex which is excellent and really helpful but although it highlights the differences that still leaves me wondering how to get around those differences.  p  pFor example, I know that codeDataTriggerscode are missing as arecodeMultiBindingscode and a whole array of other stuff.  What Im interested in reading about is not the differences per se but how you get aronud those differences or what other patterns are useful in Silverlight.  What if I strongneedstrong a codeDataTriggercode clearly my design should take these things into account.p  pSo, the question is,..if youve gone through this transition, what differences caused you the most trouble and how did you get around itp

Negative 511 pI have run in to a slight problem. The story goes as followsp  pI have a document archive system written in PHP which runs at multiple clients 23 at present. On their system they only have their documents. Every night, they all need to be synced to a master database on site central server.

I would then iterate through each record, insert it to the central server, and set the sync time on the client database record to the time the script was executed. This works, but obviously has a large overhead with the multiple queries and I have just noticed the problems now.p  pEach client can generate up to 2000  3000 odd documents a day. With these large numbers it is taking way too long 1sec  2documents.p  pIs there a better solution to my problem Preferably a PHP scripted solution as I need to do logs to check if everything was succesful.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong My current process isp  ol liSelect all the unsynced datali liBegin transactionli liInsert record into central database serverli liSelect the document record from the clientli liInsert the document into the central database serverli liUpdate sync column on clientli liUpdate sync column on serverli liCommit transactionli ol  pThis is a script run on the central server.

Negative 511 pWere developing a REST API to be consumed by a couple of mobile applications. Its important that were able to trust the identities of these mobile applications. In our current design, each API call is authenticated with an API Key parameter and secured with HTTPS. p  pMy concern is that the API Key is embedded within each copy of the mobile app, which means theres no way we can keep it secret.

A quick check with jarsigner, however, indicates all jars, including Bouncy Castle, are signed, so I safely assume they are all signed, with the exception that Bouncy Castle is signed with another certificate. p  pAnd here is my question should I try to sign all the files manually so they all have the same certificate or is the problem somewhere else like BouncyCastle cant be signed in an applet, or somethingp  pAny pointers would be highly appreciatedp  pEDITp  pI basically have TWO approaches, both failed up to nowp  pApproach 1. Extract each jars directory tree and dump them together in a shared directory, then make a jar of this directory, so all the files in it are signed by the same certificate  one jar, one certificate, right.. However, spring STILL expects the files to be organized like this distlibsbcProv.jar, instead of distlibsallLibs.jar, where all libraries are dumped into the allLibs.jar. The approach fails miserably because spring cant find any of the libraries when deployed through JWS.p  pApproach 2. Sign all jars manually WITH the SAME certificate. After spending 10 minutes manually signing the jars,  this approach also fails AND has the audacity to throw an error that bcProv.jar is NOT signed with the same certificate as the others. p  pI am puzzled, baffled and confused.

Negative 511 pLet me try to explain what the situation is as thoroughly as I can see it.p  pI have a Rails app using page caching for a specific part of the site. When looking through Google Analytics I noticed my own domain as a referrer which I found odd. Upon further investigation I discovered that when I go to one of those pages with my domain as the referrer, the links point to a different domain name but renders the page fine. For examplep  pIm on domain.com. I go to domain.comsomeonesprofile, and when I hover over any links it will say anotherdomain.comsomeonesprofileabout. Now, if I click the link, itll take me to anotherdomain.comsomeonesprofileabout yet its my page being accessed on my server logs verify it.p  pI tested this out by taking one of my unused domain names and changing the A record to my servers IP. Then I cleared the page cache directory and visited a cacheable page using the domain I just set up, domain2.comsomeonesprofile, and it cached the links as domain2.comsomeonesprofile.p  pHopefully this explanation made sense. The domain that is infiltrating my cache belongs to someone I dont know, and the intent doesnt seem in any way malicious, but I was wondering if Rails has any sort of builtin methods to circumvent something like this. Something like forcing pagecache links to use a specific domain rather than whatever the referrer domain is.p  pAny help would be appreciated, I would prefer to use builtin Rails method than to write something myself, maybemaybe not because Im lazy.p
Negative 511 pIm measuring some system performance data to store it in a database. From those data points Im drawing line graphs over time. In their nature, those data points are a bit noisy, ie. every single point deviates at least a bit from the local mean value. When drawing the line graph straight from one point to the next, it produces jagged graphs. At a large time scale like  10 data points per pixel, this noise is compressed into a wide jagged line area that is, say, 20px high instead of 1px as in smaller scales.p  pIve read about line smoothing, antialiasing, simplifying and all these things. But everything Ive found seems to be about something else.p  pI dont need antialiasing, .NET already does that for me when drawing the line on the screen.p  pI dont want simplification. I need the extreme values to remain visible, at least most of them.p  pI think it goes in the direction of spline curves but I couldnt find much example images to evaluate whether the described thing is what I want. I did find a highly scientific book at Google Books though, full of halfpage long formulas, which I wasnt like reading through now...p  pTo give you an example, just look at LinuxGnomes system monitor application. I draws the recent CPUmemorynetwork usage with a smoothed line. This may be a bit oversimplified, but Id give it a try and see if I can tweak it.p  pId prefer C code but algorithms or code in other languages is fine, too, as long as I can port it to C without external references.p
Negative 511 pstrongLast editstrong Ive figured out what the problem was see my own answer below but I cannot mark the question as answered, it would seem.  If someone can answer the questions I have in my answer below, namely, is this a bug in Cython or is this Cythons intended behavior, I will mark emthatem answer as accepted, because that would be the most useful lesson to gain from this, IMHO.p  hr  pFirstly, I have to start by saying that I have been trying to figure this out for three days, and I am just banging my head against the wall.  As best as I can tell from the documentation, I am doing things correctly.  Obviously, I cant be doing things correctly, though, because if I were, I wouldnt have a problem right.p  pIn any event, I am working on a binding for mcrypt to Python.  It should work with both Python 2 and Python 3 though its untested for Python 2.  Its available a hrefhttpmike.trausch.ussoftwaremcrypt0.0.0.tar.gz relnofollowon my sitea, linked because it is way too large to include in the post, and given that I dont know emwhatem I am doing wrong, I cannot even isolate what might be the problem code.  The script that shows the problem is a hrefhttpmike.trausch.ussoftwaretest.py relnofollowalso on my sitea.  The script just feeds 100 blocks of nothing but the letter a in whatever block size the encryption algorithmencryption mode uses, and of course should get a block of a as the result of roundtripping.  But it does not always.

I can change the algorithm and it will result in different roundtrips, but always the same for every run when I dont change the algorithm.  Im absolutely stumped.  Also, its always two blocks in a row that are corrupt as you can see in the output above blocks 5 and 6, 13 and 14, etc.  So, there is a pattern but I am, for whatever reason, unable to figure out what that pattern is pointing to precisely.p  pI realize that I am probably asking a lot here I cant isolate a small snip of code, and familiarity with both mcrypt and Python is probably required.  Alas, after three days of hitting my head on this, I need to step away from the problem for a little bit, so I am posting this here in the hopes that maybe while I am taking a break from this problem either a someone will see where I introduced a bug, b I will be able to see my bug when I get back to the problem later, or c someone or myself can find the problem which maybe isnt a bug in my code but a bug in the binding process or the library itself.p  pOne thing I havent done is attempted to use another version of the mcrypt library.  Im doing my work with Cython 0.13, Python 3.1, and mcrypt 2.5.8, all as distributed by Ubuntu in Ubuntu 10.10 except Cython, which I got from PyPi.  But I manage systems with PHP applications that are functioning just fine and using mcrypt on Ubuntu 10.10 without data corruption, so I have no reason to believe that it is the build of mcrypt, so that just leaves well, something wrong on my part somewhere, I think.p  pIn any case, I thank anyone profusely who can help.  Im starting to feel like Im going crazy because Ive been working on this problem pretty much nonstop for days and I get the feeling that the solution is probably right in front of me, but I cannot see it.p  pstrongEditstrong  Someone pointed out that I should be using memcpy instead of strncpy.  I did that, but now, the test script shows that emeveryem block is incorrect.  Color me even more confused than previously... heres the new output a hrefhttppastebin.comsA0RtZK7 relnofollowon pastebina.p  pstrongEdit 2strong  I have come back to the computer and have been looking at it again, and Im just adding print statements everywhere to find where things could be going wrong.

Examplep  precodeif recDate  null ampamp recDate gt System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerctrl.MinDate      System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerctrl.CustomFormat  MMddyyyy     System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerctrl.Value  recDate  else      System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerctrl.CustomFormat     System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerctrl.Format  DateTimePickerFormat.Custom codepre  pMy inclination is to fix this monstrosity, but given my limited time I dont want to bother with anything thats not affecting functionality or performance.p  pSo what Im wondering is, are these redundant casts getting optimized away by the compiler  I tried figuring it out myself by using ildasm on a simplified example, but not being familiar with IL I only ended up more confused.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo far, the consensus seems to be that ano, the casts are not optimized, but bwhile there may possibly be some small performance hit as a result, it is not likely significant, and cI should consider fixing them anyway.  I have come down on the side of resolving to fix these someday, if I have time. Meanwhile, I wont worry about them.p  pThanks everyonep

Negative 511 pI dont understand where this is going wrong. Basically, I have a program which receives from a message queue and processes the messages. The program can be stopped at any time, in which case the message loop finished what it is doing before the program exits. Im trying to accomplish this with the following codep  precodeprivate MessageQueue q private ManualResetEventSlim idle  public void Start      idle  new ManualResetEventSlim     q.ReceiveCompleted  this.MessageQueueReceiveCompleted         q.BeginReceive       public void Stop       this.q.Dispose     this.idle.Wait       private void MessageQueueReceiveCompletedobject sender,      ReceiveCompletedEventArgs e      Message inMsg     try              inMsg  e.Message          catch Exception ex              this.idle.Set         return            Handle message      this.q.BeginReceive  codepre  pAs is hopefully apparent, the Stop method disposes of the message queue, and then waits for the idle wait handle to be set which should occur as an ReceiveCompleted event will be called when disposed, but the e.Message property should except. p  pHowever, the message loop just continues Ive disposed the message queue, but it still manages to read from it and the exception handler is not invoked, meaning the idle.Wait line waits forever.p  pMy understanding is that disposing a message queue SHOULD end any pending receives and invoke the event, but the e.Message or q.EndReceive should throw an exception. Is this not the case If not, how else can I safely exit my message loopp  pThanksp  pUPDATEp  pHere is a complete example assumes the queue existsp  precodeclass Program      static MessageQueue mq     static ManualResetEventSlim idleWH      static void Mainstring[] args              idleWH  new ManualResetEventSlim          Console.WriteLineOpening...         using mq  new MessageQueue.privatetest                      mq.Formatter  new XmlMessageFormatternew Type[]  typeofint              mq.ReceiveCompleted  mqReceiveCompleted              for int i  0 i lt 10000 i                 mq.Sendi              Console.WriteLineBegin Receive...             mq.BeginReceive              Console.WriteLinePress ENTER to exit loop             Console.ReadLine              Console.WriteLineClosing...              mq.Close                   Console.WriteLineWaiting...         idleWH.Wait          Console.WriteLinePress ENTER ex         Console.ReadLine           static void mqReceiveCompletedobject sender, ReceiveCompletedEventArgs e              try                      var msg  mq.EndReceivee.AsyncResult             Console.Title  msg.Body.ToString               Receive next message             mq.BeginReceive                  catch Exception ex                      idleWH.Set             return                codepre
Negative 511 pI have a Mac application that keeps its own log file. It appends info to the file using NSStrings writeToFile method.

Now the problem is that after adding that URL encoding line, nothing seems to be getting written to the file. The program functions as expected otherwise however. Removing the line of code above results in all of the correct information being logged to the file removing that line is not an option because searchString must be URL encoded.p  pOh and I am using NSUTF8StringEncoding when writing the NSString to the file.p  pThanks for any help.p  pEDIT I know theres also a similar function to CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes in NSString, but Ive read that it doesnt always work.

Negative 511 pHey, a beginners question here.... In order to learn PHP and SQl I have set up a Localhost Server on my computer running Apache and phpmyadmin, using MAMP.p  pIn the course of testing, I have found that through the backend phpmyadmin interface I can modify the db as I please without any trouble.

Negative 511 pI am developing an application which is using ASP.NET MVC3 for the front end which talks to service layer via interfaces.  All of the interfacesservices are injected into the controllers via ninject and constructor injection. p  pI would like to funnel all localization through a location service which is provided by ninject. p  pEasy enough on the controller side, I have added a Localize function in the controller base class and added the ILocalizeService to the constructor, and voila, done. Anytime I need to localize a string, I can just call the localize function which in turns calls the service.p  pNow I am trying to figure out a clean way to do this on the View side. I have a base View class which exposes a Localize function like in the controller so I can pass any static text on the view, but I cant figure out a clean way to get an instance of my localization service. I have read numerous posts saying that DI into a view is bad practice, but in this case I think the base view is the cleanest place to centralize the localization of text in the view of course, I would be open to any other option which doesnt require me passing my kernel aroundp  pAny examples someone could point me to or advice on how to do this cleanly.p

Negative 511 pI am trying to implement a modified parallel depthfirst search algorithm in Erlang lets call it dfsmod.p  pAll I want to get is all the deadend paths which are basically the paths that are returned when dfsmod visits a vertex without neighbours or a vertex with neighbours which were already visited. I save each path to codeetstable1code if my custom function codefun1Pathcode returns codetruecode and to codeetstable2code if codefun1Pathcode returns codefalsecodeI need to filter the resulting deadend paths with some customer filter.p  pI have implemented a sequential version of this algorithm and for some strange reason it performs better than the parallel one.p  pThe idea behind the parallel implementation is simple p  ul livisit a codeVertexcode from code[VertexOthervertices]  Unvisitedneighbourscode, li liadd this codeVertexcode to the current pathli lisend codeself, waitcode to the collector processli lirun dfsmod for codeUnvisitedneighbourscode of the current codeVertexcode in a strongnew processstrongli licontinue running dfsmod with the rest of the provided vertices codeOtherverticescodeli liwhen there are no more vertices to visit  send codeself, donecode to the collector process and terminateli ul  pSo, basically each time I visit a vertex with unvisited neighbours I spawn a new depthfirst search process and then continue with the other vertices.p  pRight after spawning a first dfsmod process I start to collect all codePid, waitcode and codePid, donecode messages codewaitcode message is to keep the collector waiting for all the codedonecode messages. In N milliseconds after waiting the collector function returns codeokcode.p  hr  pFor some reason, this parallel implementation runs from 8 to 160 seconds while the sequential version runs just 4 seconds the testing was done on a fullyconnected digraph with 5 vertices on a machine with Intel i5 processor.p  pHere are my thoughts on such a poor performancep  ul liI pass the digraph codeGraphcode to each new process which runs dfsmod. Maybe doing codedigraphoutneighboursGraphcode against one digraph from many processes causes this slownessli liI accumulate the current path in a list and pass it to each new spawned dfsmod process, maybe passing so many lists is the problemli liI use an ETS table to save a path each time I visit a new vertex and add it to the path. The ETS properties are code[bag, public,writeconcurrency, truecode, but maybe I am doing something wrongli lieach time I visit a new vertex and add it to the path, I check a path with a custom function codefun1code it basically checks if the path has vertices labeled with letter n occurring before vertices with m and returns codetruefalsecode depending on the result. Maybe this codefun1code slows things downli liI have tried to run dfsmod without collecting codedonecode and codewaitcode messages, but codehtopcode shows a lot of Erlang activity for quite a long time after dfsmod returns codeokcode in the shell, so I do not think that the active message passing slows things down.li ul  hr  pstrongHow can I make my parallel dfsmod run faster than its sequential counterpartstrongp  pstrongEditstrong when I run the parallel dfsmod, codepmancode shows no processes at all, although codehtopcode shows that all 4 CPU threads are busy.p

Negative 511 pIm working on an Android application which is fetching data from internet among other things. Actually, the project was started by someone else which is not here anymore, and now that I have to turn it into a light client application and implement the server side in Java, Im wondering what would be the best toolspatterns to use to fit my needs.p  pLets say I have to deal with several models class representing a category of objects which all inherits from one class  they have common attributes such as name, attache thumbnail... but specific properties too. Because of this,you can understand that I cant afford to manage one specific table to map each single class.p  pHowever, I still want to be able to cache my objects  somewhere in the Android device to populate the views of the application when working in offline mode.p  pCurrently, the solution used by the previous developer was to store data directly into a TEXT field in the SQLIite database, as serialized objets. This should be ok on the server side but Ive read that the usual Java serializaton was very slow on the Android platform, although it is not really noticeable now because I work with around 50 objects,  I was looking for more performant alternatives for the future.p  pIve came across the JSON solution which can easily handle complex structures and  Jackson library seems very interesting with its simplified data binding to POJO objects and its wellknown performance. But then, how should I store my Json objects  Is it possible to keep a json string in a TEXT field of a SQlite table  Or should I rather store them as .json file for each object  Which one is the more efficient to retrieve later lot of datap  pPlus, I was thinking that JSON would be a very good exchange format between the Android client application and my server whould is in charge of processing the information from internet thirdparties apis and exposing this data with webservices. rather than trying to implement some RMIlike solution Is using the usual Apache HTTPClient enough on Android to communicate with the serverp  pFor those who successfully developped clientserver application which seems very common to me is this a good approach for Android  It seems to me that with mobile platforms, you cant really use the approach that youve learned for more classic J2EE app and such... Any advice would be greatly appreciated because Im a student and Android beginner who really want to improve her mobile development skills p  pThanks p

Negative 511 pOK, first off, bear with me as I am relatively new to Android Development.p  pSo here is the situation. I have a parent main activity that records data. Lets say, for simplicity sake that it contains an edit box. Now the child sub activity contains a single text view that is currently blank. By default, when the app starts the main activity is started. Now when the user enters his name in the edit box and clicks a button I want that name to be appended to the text view on the second activity. I can then switch to the second activity and see that change. I then hit the back button and enter another name. When i switch to the second activity again i must see that change and so on. Obviously, the scenario does not only involve edit boxes and buttons but I think the idea is the same.p  pSo in essence what I want to know isp  ol liHow do i switch between activities and keep the data on each. I would have to create both activities at run timeli liHow do I pass data between these activitiesli liWhen i press the back button when the second activity is on focus how do i stop that activity from completely closingli ol  pThanks for all your helpp

Negative 511 pThis is gonna take some explaining but here it goes.p  pI need to author a multiple instance MSI which installs dynamic instances  i.e. instances defined when the user installs the package, not hardcoded in the MSI file. Now, Ive already gone through the pains of creating a bootstrapper and using the MSI api to dynamically create a transform MST and apply it to the original MSI after much tinkering, install and uninstall works fine Ill post details as theyre needed.p  pBasically, the MST contains transforms for ProductCode, ProductName, PackageCode in Summary Info, changes GUIDs for all components otherwise uninstall fails in silly ways and the install location is protected from conflicts by the bootstrapper. Also, the bootstrapper starts the install with the command line parameter MSINEWINSTANCE1, as detailed a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa369528.aspx relnofollowherea.p  pHowever, Id also like to upgrade an installed instance via major upgrades, which is the main reason why the UpgradeCode is unique or so I thought. However after I increment the MSI version and try to start it again via the bootstrapper and passing in the desired instances ProductCode via the MSIINSTANCEGUID property, it fails the log saysp  precode Verbose logging started 12132011  174356  Build type SHIP UNICODE 5.00.7601.00  Calling process CWindowsSysWOW64msiexec.exe  MSI c 5CD0 [174356120] Font created.

Obviously thats not true the policies would appear in the log and a rather more explicit message would be provided.p  pThe 1625 error code seems to correspond to ERRORINSTALLPACKAGEREJECTED.p  pAny ideas to what I could try next Im thinking what the MSI engine should try to do in this case is examine the UpgradeCode, apply the original transform which should be cached and reachable via the product code I give it via the MSIINSTANCEGUID parameter. However its clear the engine never reaches that stage it should be logged in the log file, rightp  pSigh, this has been much more painful than it should have been.p  pEdit some time later...p  pQuick note on changing component GUIDs its only really necessary for nonfile components I have some registry entries I use to keep track of instances. If I dont change their GUID they arent cleaned up correctly at uninstall, as detailed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5046712msiwixassigningcomponentguidsduringmultipleinstancetransformsherea. For files it works fine if the key paths are different, and Ive verified that by only changing the registry component ones in my code.p  pSo Ive learned in the meantime that major upgrades probably wont work for me unless I change the UpgradeCode for each instance because FindRelatedProducts only looks at the UpgradeCode, I think, and I tried something else before going there minor upgrades. p  pStarting the installer for a new version with fvamus together with MSIINSTANCEGUIDexistinginstanceproductcode seemed to work, right up until Ive tried adding a new file to the package which I expect to happen in the future... when of course it doesnt work the component for the new file is not installed at reinstall, of course.p  pSo Ill probably either have to change the UpgradeCode with the transform and see what that implies, or mess around with the output property of FindRelatedProducts through some custom actions and see if I can convince major upgrades to work that way. However the initial problem the 1625 error was precisely with major upgrades so not sure if I can do something about it without knowing the cause. To be entirely clear what I pasted above is the ementiretyem of the MSI verbose log, it doesnt seem to do emanythingem before returning with error 1625. I also tried removing all the rows in the Upgrade table of the MSI and there was no change in behavior.p  pI also cant spend much more time on this silly issue so if nothing else works Ill be forced to do a silent uninstall followed by a regular install with the same settings. I cringe at the thought but if it cant be helped...p  pEdit in all fairness, it probably would have gone faster if I didnt start on the MSI path altogether and coded my own installer from absolute scratch, with gzipped streams and simple xcopy. Even with a msbuild task that would have compressed the files from visual studio or something.p

Negative 511 pI always thought I could use SynchronizationContext to marshal a call to another thread.

Do I really need to derive from SynchronizationContext and do work on the thread context I feel like missing something.p  pWhat I want to achive Imagine a little API for executing commands within an app. You can also execute a command on a background thread, as you can assign a delegate to run when the command has finished execution. This CallmewhendoneDelegate gets one single paramter State containing successfailure flag, optional exception information, etc. I want to call this delegate on the original calling thread so that devs using the lib do not need to handle invoke required etc. I would just like to take this away and let them do simple nonthreadaware programming. WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext doesnt seem to help either if you dont give it some control as a target.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 511 pSo Im making a program for android that tries to download something from www.wupload.com. What I want isnt a browser but to interact with the webpage without actually showing it. Like how HtmlUnit is supposed to work.p  pIm using apache for the html requests and what Ive done so far is send a post that simulates clicking on slow download on the web page. Then I read the response so I can get some variables needed to make the next post and execute the next post. In theory, the web page should be showing the captcha cause the response I get is please enter the captcha, but no image url.p  pThe next step would be to enter the captcha and finally download the file, the problem Im having is I dont know how to show the captcha image to the user. Do I have to capture it somehow I know how to make the post to send what the user would type, but the image url of the captcha isnt in the source code.p  pI thought of inspecting the web page so I could get the url from the DOM tree, like what inspect element on google chrome does, but I have no idea if its even possible. Any ideas would be great.p  pthxp

Negative 511 pWe are developing an app on BlackBerry which connect to Foursquare using OAuth. We are having difficulty with the flow. What we have right now is if a user click connect to foursquare, the app will open a browser outside the app to let user do the AllowDeny thing. The issue is after the user click on Allow, the browser doesnt send the user back to the app. At that time the user is already connected which can be seen on foursquare.com, but since we cannot capture the oauth credentials since the browser doesnt send the user back to the app, we are kind of stuck on that steps. So the question is what can we do to either send back the user to the app where we can get the oauth info or we would also like to embed the allowdeny page inside the app. I saw some mobile app using myappconnect for the url callback, our Android dev also using that and it works. But does it also apply to BlackBerryp  pthanks p

Negative 511 pAs its name reveals, XML Extensible Markup Language is designed as a markup language and not as a data object representation model.

Negative 511 pIm currently interning at a fashion company whose business revolves around selling online reports to customers. They handle orders manually by phone, email, and allow customers to read certain reports or categories of reports by adding users and setting flags in their backend OMS to grant access. Theyre looking to launch a new, separate site right now that removes the burden from them and decouples the reports from each other. Essentially, they want to sell oneoff reports individually through an online shopping cart.p  pIve been looking for solutions I could integrate with their site, but nothing has offered the tight integration they need as far as I could tell. Reports their content, images, prices, etc. are defined within the OMS, and the site which runs on ASP.NET pulls all the relevant information to display from there. Now, normally, this doesnt sound like much of a problem, except these reports are not downloadable PDFs. Theyre supposed to be generated HTML viewable only online, when the user is logged in. Instead of selling products, the company needs the shopping cart to modify their user database to add purchased reports to users.p  pRight now, the only solution I can see is building a custom shopping cart system, which is the last thing I want to do both in terms of work, and in terms of security for the company. Its time consuming, and tough to get right, so really, I want to avoid it if at all possible. I might have overlooked a system that fits their needs a shopping cart that pulls information from an already built database of product descriptions and is customizable to allow for accessing the OMS database to flag reports for users, which is why Im asking. Is there a system like this Or is a custom solution really necessaryp

Negative 511 pIm not sure if this is the correct term for it, but what I believe Im trying to do is write a pipe of sorts for GLSL shaders on OpenGL ES 2.0. The idea is that this will be a handy component, if you will, which will go into the graphics pipe of my engine. My target platform is Android. Id like some criticism regarding my design methodology behind this. In a nutshell, it seems like Im faced with either creating a dynamic processing pipe which Im just able to simply specify some settings and add values to, or having a minimal amount of automation and still keeping things relatively low level in terms of how much code is being written, and what the code is doing.p  pstrongThe Detailsstrongp  pSo far, my design methodology is as followsp  ul liShader files are stored in the assets folderli liJava acts as a frontend, gets all shader files, and stores each one in a Shader object which contains information about the type of shader and the original shader source.li liJava then sends shader data to C in an array of these custom shader objects i.e., emnotem the OpenGL shader objects  yet, which are then parsed by the JNI.li liAfterward, the JNI sends the shader sources obtained via Java to a ShaderHandler class singleton, which holds a multidimensional codestdvectorlt stdvectorlt GLuint gt gtcode for each type of shader one for vertex, one for fragment, one for texture, etc.. ul liThe ShaderHandler class does the compiling and linking of the shader objects into a programmable interface, once this has been accomplished, it channels much of the heavy lifting by extending its functionality to component classes which act as ShaderVariable handlers, via assigning values to them dynamically. For instance, once could simply specify a valuevectormatrixwhatever and the number of indices to modify, and pass that into the ShaderVariable handler. As soon as that SVH gets, it it stores it in a codestdmapcode, using the name of the variable as its identifier. li ulli liWhen prompted to, these SVH objects which are stored in a vector that resides in the ShaderHandler class essentially embindem the attributes and uniforms of whatever values exist in their stdmaps, dynamically.li ul  pSome of the memory allocated is done through pointers, but, admittedly, most of this consists of the stack. Im wondering if I should look into more dynamic memory allocation for this, as on an Android phone I would imagine a stack overflow could be very, very achievable with a methodology like this for a somewhat ambitious game with good graphics and the like.p  pThoughts p

But now, jquery freaks out and sits on a loading screen forever because it cant find dashboard because that content was only added after the user clicked a button.p  pHow do I work around thisp  pThanks.p  pstrongpage1 index.htmlstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegttitlelttitlegt ltscriptgtltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srccordova1.7.0.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjsjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjsjquery.mobile.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjsglobal.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjslogin.jsgtltscriptgt  ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssjquery.mobile.css gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssstyle.css gt  ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srccordova1.7.0.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjsjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjsjquery.mobile.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8 srcjslogin.jsgtltscriptgt  ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssjquery.mobile.css gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssstyle.css gt  ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv datarolepage datathemebgt          ltdiv dataroleheader datathemebgt             lth1gtLoginlth1gt         ltdivgt         lt header gt          ltdiv datarolecontentgt             ltdiv classrowgt                 ltlabel forloginnamegtLogin Nameltlabelgt ltinput                     classuiinputtext typetext nameloginname idloginname gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classrowgt                 ltlabel forbasicgtPasswordltlabelgt ltinput classuiinputtext                     typepassword namepassword idpassword gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classrowgt                 ltinput typecheckbox nameremember idremember classcustom                     dataminitrue gt ltlabel forremembergtRemember Meltlabelgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classrowgt                 ltinput typesubmit idsubmit namesubmit valueSubmit gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         lt content gt      ltdivgt     lt page gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongpage2 dashboard.htmlstrongp  precodeltdiv iddashboard datarolepage datathemeb dataurlindex.htmlampdashboardgt  ltdiv dataroleheader datathemebgt     lth1 idpagetitlegtDashboardlth1gt ltdivgt codepre  p p  pstronglogin.jsstrongp  precodefunction    submit.clickfunction       if loginname.val            alertPlease enter a login name         return false           if password.val            alertPlease enter a password         return false           .postURL  login,          APIKEY  APIKEY,         login  loginname.val,         password  password.val     , functiondata          if data.error                 .mobile.changePagedashboard.html,  transition  slide           else              alertdata.error               , json   codepre  pp

This calculator     will be described in the next section, Using polygonal techniques.     osgrefptrltosgGeometrygt geom  new osgGeometry     geomgtsetVertexArray vertices.get      geomgtaddPrimitiveSet indices.get      osgUtilSmoothingVisitorsmooth geom      Add the geometry to an osgGeode object and make it the scene root     osgrefptrltosgGeodegt root  new osgGeode     rootgtaddDrawable geom.get      osgViewerViewer viewer     viewer.setSceneData root.get      return viewer.run   int drawShapeUsingVertices      Create the vertex array and push the four corner points to the back of the array by using vector like operations     osgrefptrltosgVec3Arraygt vertices  new osgVec3Array     verticesgtpushback osgVec30.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f      verticesgtpushback osgVec31.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f      verticesgtpushback osgVec31.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f      verticesgtpushback osgVec30.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f      We have to indicate the normal of each vertex otherwise OpenGL will use a default 0, 0, 1 normal vector     and the lighting equation calculation may be incorrect. The four vertices actually face the same direction,     so a single normal vector is enough. We will also set the setNormalBinding method to BINDOVERALL later.     osgrefptrltosgVec3Arraygt normals  new osgVec3Array      normalsgtpushback osgVec30.0f,1.0f, 0.0f      osgrefptrltosgVec4Arraygt colors  new osgVec4Array     here We will indicate a unique color value to each vertex and make them colored. By default,      OpenGL will use smooth coloring and blend colors at each vertex together     colorsgtpushback osgVec41.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f      colorsgtpushback osgVec40.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f      colorsgtpushback osgVec40.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f      colorsgtpushback osgVec41.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f      Next, we create the osgGeometry object and set the prepared vertex, normal, and color arrays to it.      We also indicate that the single normal should be bound to the entire geometry and that the colors     should be bound per vertex     osgrefptrltosgGeometrygt quad  new osgGeometry     quadgtsetVertexArray vertices.get      quadgtsetNormalArray normals.get      quadgtsetNormalBinding osgGeometryBINDOVERALL      quadgtsetColorArray colors.get      quadgtsetColorBinding osgGeometryBINDPERVERTEX       The last step required to finish a geometry and add it to the scene graph is to specify the primitive set.     A newly allocated osgDrawArrays instance with the drawing mode set to GLQUADS is used here, in order to     render the four vertices as quad corners in a counterclockwise order     quadgtaddPrimitiveSet new osgDrawArraysGLQUADS, 0, 4      Add the geometry to an osgGeode object and render it in the scene viewer     osgrefptrltosgGeodegt root  new osgGeode     rootgtaddDrawable quad.get      osgViewerViewer viewer     viewer.setSceneData root.get      return viewer.run  codepre

Negative 511 pI am looking for a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiContinuousintegration relnofollowstrongContinuous Integrationstronga tool for various a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiScala28programminglanguage29 relnofollowstrongScalastronga projects. So far I found a hrefhttpjenkinsci.org relnofollowJenkinsa, which apparently supports Scala project via a plugin for a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSimpleBuildTool relnofollowSbta, and a hrefhttpzutubi.comproductspulse relnofollowPulsea, which does not directly support Scala projects but claims that it makes it easy to integrate any command line build tool, which matches Sbt. I dont have any practical experience with CI, but read a couple of articles about it, usually related to Java.p  pBesides the usual features, e.g. support for various strongcode versioning systemsstrong and strongpublishing nightly buildsstrong Id like to be able to strongrecord a bunch of statistics, plot them over time and trigger notificationsstrong if certain numbers change unexpectedly, i.e., by more than a defined factor. In essence, each test from a test suite prints a number of statistics at the end, which could be extracted by a regular expression and then persisted associated with the test case they came from.p  pIdeally, there also is an easy way to create queries over the recorded statistics, e.g., to compare the last run of the test suite with an earlier one. However, this is probably not something that can be done directly in a CI tool, but it should at least be possible to export the recorded data in a queryable format, e.g., XML or JSON.p  pAny hints, links or experience reports are welcomep  pbr strongEDIT 1strongp  pThe statistics are not JVMstatistics in some sense, e.g., code coverage or memory consumption. They are related to the actual work performed by the projects, e.g., the number of comparisons performed by a sorting algorithm, or the number of conflicting assignments in a SAT solver. The numbers are printed to stdio at the end of each run, or written to a file. The CI tool should only allow me to render them as graphs over time, or to perform simple analyses sum, meridian, or to send a mail when a number diverts from the average.p

Negative 511 pThere are many many posts and an infinite number of questions on how to create a custom row and add it to a ListView.

Negative 511 pI have an old application which has numerous webforms. On every codeaspxcode page there is a designated back button, which takes the user to the previous page. All the buttons have the javascript codeonclickcode event set to codehistory.backcode.  p  pOn one of the codeaspxcode pages, the back button would not work at all. We decided to use a server side button that would accomplish the same thing. The onclick event of the button has the necessary code to take the user to previous page.p  pFirst I created the onclick event in the following way, but the back button did not work at all. When I went in the debug mode, I found that the codeprevPagecode variable was holding the current page URL instead of the previous page URL.p  precodeprivate void btnBackClickobject sender, System.EventArgs e      string prevPage  Request.UrlReferrer.ToString     Response.RedirectprevPage  codepre  pThen I changed the codeprevPagecode to a static variable and defined its value to be set inside the codeifIsPostBackcode block. Now the back button worked correctly. p  precodestatic string prevPage  string.Empty private void PageLoadobject sender, System.EventArgs e      ifIsPostBack              prevPage  Request.UrlReferrer.ToString        private void btnBackClick      Response.RedirectprevPage  codepre  pI did not understand why the first attempt wouldnt work and why second attempt would. p  pI have a feeling that this might explain if there is something else going on with this particular page that would also not let the codehistory.backcode or codehistory.go1code work. p  pCan you please provide some insight into this p  pEdit I am using IE8.p

All I can find are threads where people cant bind the events, not threads where people are experiencing over active bound function calls.p  pIn general I am open to any suggestion of better coding practice but in particular, please help put me out of my misery on this event bind mouseenterleave thing.p  pAgain, sry bout all the code, I wanted to leave no ambiguity.p  precode...  window.HomeIconView  Backbone.View.extend   model new HomeIconModel,  template .template[                 lta hrefgt,                     ltdiv classhomeIcon idhomeIconlt id gtgt,                         ltimg srclt homeIconSrc gtgt,                     ltdivgt,                 ltagt                 ].join,  events  mouseenter renderRollOver, mouseleave renderRollOut ,  initialize functionmd       .bindAllthis, render     this.id  Icon  md.c.id.toString     this.model.savemd.c ,  render function      return this.el.htmlthis.templatethis.model.toJSON ,  renderRollOver function       console.logrollover         homeRollOver, homeRollOver2.css display block, opacity 0.125          home  this.id.stop.animate  opacity 1 , 1000         var elOffset  home  this.id.offset         var elOffsetL  elOffset.left                                                                                         parseInthomeRollOver.csswidth                                   parseInthome  this.id.csswidth                               2                                  var elOffsetT  elOffset.top                                                                                        parseInthomeRollOver.cssheight                                   parseInthome  this.id.cssheight                               2                                  homeRollOver, homeRollOver2.css              marginLeft elOffsetL, marginTop elOffsetT           ,  renderRollOut function      console.logrollout     homeRollOver, homeRollOver2.cssdisplay, none     home  this.id.stop.animate opacity 0.125 , 1000     window.HomeView  Backbone.View.extend  model new PreloadHomeImages,  template .template[             ltdiv idhomeIconWrappergtltdivgt,             ltdiv idhomeRollOvergtltdivgt,             ltdiv idhomeRollOver2gtltdivgt             ].join,  initialize function      PAGEH  document.height     PAGEW  document.width     this.preload     this.render ,  preload function      var i  0     .eachthis.model.geticons, functionicon          var tmpimg  ltimggt         tmpimg.src  icon.image         i          this.el.csspaddingTop, PAGEH  180  2      wrapper.cssheight, PAGEH  50 ,  render function      this.el.htmlthis.template     var i  0     .eachthis.model.geticons, functionicon          var iconView  new HomeIconView                                 model new HomeIconModel,                                  c  id i, homeIconSrc icon.image                                       homeIconWrapper.appendiconView.render         i          return this    ... codepre

The above sample XML fails for the fourth instance of codeltemptyCheckgtcode, but not for the third.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltgrammar ns xmlnshttprelaxng.orgnsstructure1.0gt     ltstartgt         ltelement nametestRootgt             ltoneOrMoregt                 ltelement nameemptyCheckgt                     ltemptygt                 ltelementgt             ltoneOrMoregt         ltelementgt     ltstartgt ltgrammargt codepre  pI recognize that in most XML processing the node with just white space wont really matter. Id still like to solve this so I can enforce a coding style guide. So, is there a way to setup a Relax NG schema so that a document wont validate if a node has just white space in it when it should be completely emptyp

Negative 511 pI am working on a feature branch in bazaar. For the purposes of building the project locally, I modified a file locally codebuildcode, although I do not want this change to be included in my commits. Most of the time I remember to exclude that file from codebzr commitcode, or aborted when seeing the summary, but a few commits ago I did overlook it and now the local change has entered the history.p  pBefore submitting my branch, Id like to clean this up. Is there a way to remove that change from the earlier commit without reverting to the state before and redoing all commits Naturally, this does involve rewriting history.p  pFor clarification In git, I would use codegit rebase icode and just edit the commit.p

Negative 511 pIm struggling with a bug, that I cant nail down.   p  pI have a function that takes a postcode, does a lookup, and returns a latitude, longitude and area name.p  pfor example, pass it AD300 it returns something like 42.6, 1.55, ordino  it works very well.p  pThe function is called like thisp  precodemy lat, lng, area  objectgtrelease codepre  pThe return values are fine, and I can print them in perl with a warnp  precodewarn Area area, rellat, rellng codepre  pThis works fine. Area Ordino, 42.6, 1.55p  pI then take one of these values, say area, add it to a hash of data, and pass it to a web page where it is preprocessed via TT as I do successfully with a load of other variables.p  pIm assigning the value to the hash in the normal way. e.g.  hasharea  areap  pHere is where the fun begins.  When I try to reference the value in TT e.g. [ hash.area ] I dont get Ordino printed on the web page, Im told Ive passed an Array reference to TT.p  pAfter a little debugging, Ive found that my hash variable hash.area, is somehow referencing an array according to TT holding the three values that Ive returned from the subroutine release. I.e.      hash.area  [42.6, 1.55, ordino] according to TT.p  pThat is, to get the value Ordino within the web page, I have to access [ hash.area.2 ].p  pFurther, I can set hasharea to equal any of the variables, lat, lng, or area and get the same behavior.  TT believes all three variables reference the same array. that isp  plat  lng  area  [42.6, 1.55, ordino] according to TTp  pThis is bizare, I can happily print the variables in perl and they appears as normal  not an array.  Ive tried dumping the hash with dumper, no array, everything is fine.  Yet somehow, TT is finding an array.  Its doing my head in.p  pThe site is quite large, with a lot of pages and I happily pass variables and hashes via TT to web pages all the time, and have been for 4 years now. Ive never seen this. On other pages, I even pass exactly the same output from the release method and it is processed correctly.p  pI dont emthinkem my TT processing code is the problem, however the following is relevant.p  precodemy tt  Templategtnew     INCLUDEPATH gt [ templatedirectories ],     COMPILEEXT gt .ttc,     COMPILEDIR gt tmpttc,     FILTERS gt YMGNViewgtfilters,     PLUGINBASE gt [ YMGNVTTPlugins ],     EVALPERL gt 1   selfgttt  tt selfgttemplatedirectories  templatedirectories selfgtoutput  paramsgtoutput  undef selfgtdata  paramsgtdata  [] codepre  pThe above creates a new tt object and is part of the new function refed below. data contains the hash.  output holds the processed template ready to send to users browser.  We call new above, process the data and create the output with the code below.p  precodesub process  my self  shift my params  shift  if ref self  exists selfgttt      my class  self     self  classgtnewparams   if selfgtoutput      die You need to specify output   delete selfgterror  selfgtygtutilsgtuntaintselfgttemplate my rv  selfgtttgtprocess     selfgttemplate,     selfgtdata,     selfgtoutput,     binmode gt utf8,   if rv      warn selfgtttgterror     return          error gt selfgtttgterror,       return 0  codepre  pAll of the above is sanitised because there is a lot of other stuff going on. I believe whats important is that the data going in looks correct, here is a full dump of the complete data that is being processed by tt at the point of processing.  The thing that is causing the problem is bubbles[]release note, that release  area in the data.  The name was changed for unrelated reasons.  As you can see, dumper thinks its a string.

Negative 511 pthanks for reading this questionp  pI have been working on a icon project with a few other designers. We are experimenting Github with version control, and we wanted to use the Image View mode to diff our icons.p  pHowever, since we are working in Illustrator, which is not supported by image mode, we cannot directly compare versions of icons. That is why we would like illustrator or automator, applescript to trigger an auto export option when the file is editedsaved, so we can compared the exported version in PNG or JPG with Image View mode on Github.p  pI hope that gives you an idea of our situation. Any answer would be very helpful. Thanksp

Negative 511 pI recently took over a project written in C and C that will be compiled using the MS Visual Studio 2003 compiler. Since I have a little lack on experience with compiler settings and compiler output I want to know if the given setup realy makes a difference according to compilation output or performance.p  pThe project uses a mixture of C and C. The main part is written in C but uses some classes written in C.  So the first part of the question is does the MS VS 2003 compiler makes a difference per file compiling plain c for .cpp files using only c functionality and compiling c style for files using the classes  Could there be a reason for using that performance boost, backward compatibilityp  pThe project also does not use trycatch blocks since it is not plain C. But the exception handling options in the compiler settings are not disabled. So the second part of the question could there be still a performance boost or any other logical reason for not using trycatch but NOT disabling it in the compilerp  pYes, I am quite confused by this setup and trying to understand.p

Negative 511 pI have built a little system that uses dnode, shoe and browserify on the client, and NodeJS and dnodeshoe on the server end. Im wondering if it is a good idea to use dnode RPC as the sole protocol for a realtime web application.p  pLets look at the benefits of DNode or any other RPC interface. I like being able to call functions remotely RPC. It definitely beats Ajax because you get a consistent interface for communicating from the client to the server and server to the client. Im also betting that you get a small measure of performance over Ajax because of the HTTP overhead involved with Ajax.p  pHowever, using RPC, you have to deal with load balancing and the client connections on the server. But this goes with any websocket implementation. But, with other websocket implementation, you have a more traditional event based system, where the client listens to events from the server and responds to those events. I tried replicating this sort of interface using EventEmitters, but its awful, and I keep getting warnings about too many handlers. Ughp  pIm looking to achieve a lightweight, clean, interface that I can use to develop my application with. One that feels robust and is able to scale to many clients. It needs to feel solid.p  pIm not really sure what my question is in writing this post. Im tasked to update this codebase I wrote so that connections arent lost, and its overall more robust. I guess Im just desperate for advice or consulting with my application. Is there someone so willing as to go facetoface with me on discussing this topic RPC and realtime web applicationsp  pThanks for reading.p

The two properties expose that list as codeListltobjectgtcode and codeListltstringgtcode respectively. However, since codeList.Castltstringgt.ToListcode creates a COPY of the actual list, the line codeStrings.Add Worldcode doesnt affect the actual list. Is there a way to ensure a CASTED REFERENCE to the actual list is returned in the codeStringscode property instead of a CASTED COPY of the actual listp  pNote The code can fail when an integer is added to codeObjectscode and then accessed from codeStringscode but thats not what Im worried about at the moment.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe original question was as follows. It was changed to avoid confusion and simplify the problem at hand.

I know the reason is because casting a List to List actually creates a new copy of the list and returns that instead. Im wondering if it is possible to write these classes such that it works both ways.p

Negative 511 pSo Ive been using this site for a lot of my questions. Im very good with Googling problems and debugging even the worst error code, but this is something rather basic that Im not able to figure out.p  pMy UIView compared to what I actually see on the iTouch has always been a bit different. Im not sure if this is xCodes IB just having larger graphics for its buttons, but in general there is this 20px height difference, to the point where if I set a button at the bottom of the UIView, it gets cut off. I thought it was supposed to be 320x460..p  pNormally I shrug this off because it hasnt been an issue till Ive started to put scrolling into place with the login screen. xCode claims my view is 320x548, my app says its 320x480. If I resize my scroll size to 320x480, the view shrinks on the iTouch, leaving a large gap.p  pI have been using UIViews in the IB rather then a ViewController because Im subviewing mixed with some nav control.p  pIs there something that Im doing wrongp  pa hrefhttpoi49.tinypic.comrrnjit.jpg relnofollowhttpoi49.tinypic.comrrnjit.jpga  when first loadingp  pa hrefhttpoi50.tinypic.comj8matu.jpg relnofollowhttpoi50.tinypic.comj8matu.jpga scrolling down about 20 px..p

The code that uses these classes include putting them in codeBundlecodes which is why I need codeSerializablecode. I considered that perhaps somehow ProGuard thinks that codeFoocode is never used as a codeSerializablecode but that seems unlikely given that I pass it as a parameter to codeBundle.putSerializableString, Serializablecode and also I do an implicit cast codeSerializable serializable  foocode. In fact, when I debug, I can see the codeFoocode get put into the codeBundlecode and I can examine the codeBundlecode and see the instance of codeFoocode there, but when retrieving it the cast fails. p

Negative 511 pI created a map that focuses on a users location. The map has a single marker with an info window. When a user clicks on the info window it gives him a hyperlink to an info page info.html.

Negative 511 pI have several 1000s of images on disk that I need to display a subset of, given user search criteria.  What this means is I could be showing 100s at one time.  Each image is large 3510x1131 to be exact.  And I need to do some light image processing before they are displayed adjusting brightness and contrast.p  pMy application to do this is a Web.API app using jQuery.p  pMy first pass was to just pass the URLs to the browser and then size the images and make those adjustments using pixastic.  Works, but its pretty slow.p  pI was thinking it would be much faster if I could resize the image before doing the adjustments, but I dont want to create copies and then link to those.  Maybe there is a way to generate the images on the fly and serve them up  Via REST perhaps  Bottom line is I need a LOSSY image resize, not just setting width and height using css.p  pAre there tools out there that I am missing or has anyone done something similar  I think what Im looking for is exactly like google image search results but I dont know how they generate those thumbnails and if I were to adjust brightnesscontrast am I doing it on the thumbail saving time or the full size imagep

Negative 511 pI am working on animating a line graph using d3.js, and have been closely following a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgduopixel4063326 relnofollowthis examplea. The code I have written works just like the example...but the bug I am trying to fix is one that is also unfixed in this example. So going forward, just follow that link to see the bug for yourselfp  pIn Chrome and IE10, the chart works just as it is supposed to. However, in Firefox, the line does not just draw itself from left to right. Instead, the page loads with the line already displayed, then the line emerasesem itself from left to right, and then finally draws itself again from left to right like it should have done in the first place.p  pAlso notice that the line drawing is twice as fast on firefox as the other browsers  this means that the issue is with the transition itself the transition of the strokedashoffset property is handled differently by firefox and the other browsers. Specifically, if we remove the transition from the equation, the main difference becomes evident With strokedashoffset set to totalLength, Firefox displays the entire path, as opposed to none of it, like the other browsers do.p  pSo my question is is this a bug, or is this bad form on my and a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgduopixel relnofollowduopixelas part If the former is the case, does anybody know a workaround or a fix If the latter, I would be very grateful if you could show me the correct way to do thisp

The semicolons are supposed to be used in the Makefile to signal the end of a single command. However, the semicolon is instead being interpreted as just another command argument, and all of the lines are turning into one long command. This then overwrites perl.exe after creating a backup, thank goodness, then tries to run perl.exe, which is now impossible, and a message pops up saying that perl.exe isnt even a real program. Its a complete disaster.p  pMy question is stronghow can I edit this target so that the semicolon is interpreted as the endofcommand within dmake, instead of being sent as another command line argumentstrong p  pBy the way, removing the space before the semicolon tacks it on as part of the codedtdtocode file name, which causes an error because it doesnt exist.p

Negative 511 pI would like to know the performance difference for Cassandras secondary index vs. DSEs solr indexing placed on CFs.p  pWe have a few CFs that we did not place secondary indices on because we were under the impression that secondary indices would eventually cause significant performance issues for heavy readwrite CFs. We are trying to turn to Solr to allow for searching these CFs but it looks like loading an index schema modifies the CFs to have secondary indices on the columns of interest.p  pWould like to know if Solr indexing is different than Cassandras secondary indexing And, will it eventually cause slow queries insertsreads for CFs w large data sets and heavy readwrites If so, would you advise custom indexing which we wanted to avoid Btw  were also using trying to use Solr for its spatial searching.p  pThanks for any advicelinks you can give. p  hr  pUPDATE To better understand why Im asking these questions and to see if I am asking the right questions  description of our use casep  pWere collecting sensor events  many  We are storing them in both a time series CF EventTL and skinny CF Event.  Because we are writing inserting and updating heavily in the Event CF, we are not placing any secondary indices.  Our queries right now are limited to single events via Event or time range of events through EventTL unless we create additional fat CFs to allow range queries on other properties of the events.p  pThats where DSE SolrCassandra might help us.  We thought that leveraging Solr searching would allow us to avoid creating extra fat CFs to allow searches on other properties of the events AND allow us to search on multiple properties at once location  textproperties.  However, looking at how the definition of the Event CF changes after adding an index schema for Event via Solr shows that secondary indices were created.  This leads to the question of whether these indices will create issues for insertingupdating rows in Event eventually.  We require being able to insert new events quickly  because events can potentially come in at 1000 per sec.p

Negative 511 pI hope there is some expert on C3P0 that can help me answer the following question.p  pFirst, heres the general problem Im trying to solve. We have an application connected to a database. When the database goes out, requests start taking several seconds to be processed, as opposed to a few milliseconds. This is because C3P0 will attempt to create new connections to the database. It will eventually timeout and the request will be rejected.p  pI came up with a proposal to fix it. Before grabbing a connection from the pool, Ill query C3P0s APIs to see if there are any connections in the pool. If there are none, well immediately drop the request. This way, our latency should remain in the milliseconds, instead of waiting until the timeout occurs. This solution works because C3P0 is capable of removing connections if it detects that theyve gone bad.p  pNow, I set up a test with the values for setTestConnectionOnCheckin and setTestConnectionOnCheckout as false. According to my understanding, this would mean that C3P0 would not test a connection or, lets say, a connection in use, because theres also the idleConnectionTestPeriod setting. However, when I run my test, immediately after shutting off the database, C3P0 detects it and removes the connections from the pool. To give you a clearer picture, heres the executions resultp  p144801  Request processed successfully. Processing time 5 ms. 144802  Request processed successfully. Processing time 4 ms. 144803  Database is shut down at this point. 144804  java.net.ConnectException. 144805  Request rejected. Processing time 258 ms. 144806  Request rejected. Processing time 1 ms. 144807  Request rejected. Processing time 1 ms.p  pC3P0 apparently knew that the database went down and removed the connections from the pool. It probably took a while, because the very first request after the database was shut off took longer than the others. I have run this test several times and that single request can take from 1 ms up to 3.5 seconds which is the timeout time. This entry appears as many times as the number of connections I have defined for my pool. I have omitted all the rest for simplicity.p  pI think its great that C3P0 is capable of removing the connections from the pool right away well, as quickly as 258 ms. in the above example, but Im having troubles explaining other people why that works. If setTestConnectionOnCheckin and setTestConnectionOnCheckout are set to false, how is C3P0 capable of knowing that a connection went badp  pEven if they were set to true, testing a connection is supposed to attempt executing a query on the database something like select 1  1 from dual. We the database goes down, shouldnt the test timeout In other words, shouldnt C3P0 take 3.5 seconds to determine that a connection has gone badp  pThanks a lot, in advance.p

Negative 511 pI have been using the forums for a couple of weeks now while learning VBA. But now I am stuck and need help. So here is my problemp  pI have a workbook with several worksheets in it. For simplicity lets assume that I have two worksheets. One with a lot of raw data material and one which is nicely formatted and will be the receiving sheet.p  pThe raw data table looks like this I have 8 columns and I need to check for two conditions in each row columns B and E and sum up the values in column H.  Column B contains different names and column E contains a working status, e.g. ready or talking. I do have about 3.000 rows and a set of about 20 different names with different status. So overall I have, lets say 100 rows with the name Smith and the status talking in no particular order. I now need to sum up all the numbers column H in each of those rows where the name Smith and the status talking are put in. After that, I would like to have the name column B, the status column E and the sum column H, to be written into cells of the same workbook in a dynamic range, starting at I3K3. I have to admit that I am totaly in the dark on this one.. I really hope that you guys can help me with some code andor point me into the right direction. Most of all I hope that you could also explain what your code does, so I can understand it properly and learn. Thanks in advance guysp  pHere is my code so farp  precodePrivate Sub SumNumbers  Dim tbl As Worksheet Dim x As Integer Dim lrow As Long Dim lastname As String Dim astatus As String Dim number As Integer Dim counter As Integer  Set wb  ThisWorkbook Set tbl  wb.SheetsSheet1 lrow  tbl.CellsRows.Count, B.EndxlUp.Row lastname  tbl.CellsC2C amp lrow.Text astatus  tbl.CellsE2E amp lrow.Text number  tbl.CellsH2H amp lrow  For x  2 To lrow      If lastname  Smith And astatus  Talking Then         counter  counter  number     End If  Next x  End Sub codepre

Negative 511 pI have written a gem that allows Google Spreadsheets to be transformed into Rails models. The sequence of this process involves creating all the models, then hooking up their associations, then saving all the models. It supports all the types of association available, and in every case bar one, creating the models, establishing associations, then saving the models works correctly.

Negative 511 pHow can I achieve this design..p  pI have a table example  Customers with  4 fields.p  pI have developed a WCF service as customerinfo.mycompanyName.comLookUpservic.svc which will provide access to Customers table data.p  pThe above lookup service will be made accessible  outside our office network since public facing websites needs to access the data from customers table.p  pAlso I need to develop a website for editing the customers data. This website will not be accessed outside our office network and it will be windows based authentication . All the operations CRUD needs to be done in WCF.

Negative 511 pIm working on a project where most of the responses from my genericHandlers are the same.p  pWere using .NET and we request json data with jQuery calls to genericHandlers.p  pWe have a return type that is used 90 of the time, it is a json similar to this  code response  code 0, return myJson code, and I treat that return in the JavaScript.p  pSo whenever something goes wrong in the genericHandler I already have a class to treat errors and return them within that format.p  pWhat Im looking for is ways to avoid using try catch in every single handler we create and repeat the code all over again. p  pHere is an example of how the ProcessRequest method would look likep  precodepublic void ProcessRequestHttpContext context              context.Response.ContentType  UContentType.Json          try                       My code here                  catch Exception ex                      UError.AddMessageex.Message              Method that converts the errors into a json string              context.Response.WriteUMessage.SendErrorMessage                           codepre  pWhat I need is to wrap that method into something that would eliminate the repetition to that try catch in every handler. p  pI thought of using inheritance or something like that.p  pThe end result I had in ming was to achieve something like thisp  precodepublic class getUser  IHttpHandlerWithExceptionTreatment  a shorter name though       public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context                           My code here                             public bool IsReusable              get                      return false                codepre  pAnd if anything threw an exception there it would be caught in that extended class or somewhere else.p  pI dont know whether I can use a design pattern I thought about decorator or template or just simple inheritance.

Negative 511 pI have a rather straightforward problem Id like to solve with more efficiency than Im currently getting.p  pI have a bunch of data coming in as a set of monitoring metrics.  Input data is structured as an array of tuples. Each tuple is timestamp, value.  Timestamps are integer epoch seconds, and values are normal floating point numbers.  Example p  precodeinArr  [ 1388435242, 12.3, 1388435262, 11.1, 1388435281, 12.8, ... ] codepre  pThe timestamps are not always the same number of seconds apart, but its usually close.  Sometimes we get duplicate numbers submitted, sometimes we miss datapoints, etc.  p  pMy current solution takes the timestamps and p  ul lifinds the num seconds between each successive pair of timestampsli lifinds the median of these delaysli licreates an array of the correct sizeli lipresumes the first time period starts at half the median value before the first timestamp putting the measurement in the middle of the time periodli liaverages values that happen to go into the same time bucketli liadds data to this array according to the correct timestamp  starttimemedian element.li liif theres no value for a time range, I obviously output a None value.li ul  pOutput data has to be in the formatp  precodeoutArr  [ startTime, timeStep, numVals, [ val1, val2, val3, val4, ... ] ] codepre  pI suspect this is a solved problem with Python Pandas a hrefhttppandas.pydata.org relnofollowhttppandas.pydata.orga  or Numpy  SciPy.p  pYes, my solution works, but when Im operating on 60K datapoints it can take a tenth of a second or more to run.  This is troublesome when Im trying to work on stronglargestrong numbers of sets of data.  p  pSo, Im looking for a solution that might run faster than my purePython version.  I guess Im presuming based on a couple of previous conversations with an Argonne National Labs guy that SciPy and Numpy are clearingthroat somewhat faster at array operations.  Ive looked briefly an hour or so at the Pandas code but it looks cumbersome to do this set of operations.  Am I incorrectp  p strongEdit to show expected outputstrong p  pThe median time between datapoints is 20 seconds, half that is 10 seconds.  To make sure we put the lines well between the timestamps, we make the start time 10 seconds before the first datapoint.  If we just make the start time the first timestamp, its a lot more likely that well get 2 timestamps in one interval.  p  pSo, 1388435242  10  1388435232.  The timestep is the median, 20 seconds.  The numvals here is 3.p  precodeoutArr  [ 1388435232, 20, 3, [ 12.3, 11.1, 12.8 ]  codepre  pThis is the format that Graphite expects when were graphing the output its not my invention.

Negative 511 pTo give a concrete context, I am talking about an OO designed system with quite some complexity, e.g. over 100 classes. This is a typical project like most in my experience, current one and where my confusions come from.p  pI am from a JavaC background. Honestly, I admit those languages brainwashed me. So I get confusions about using copy, reference or pointer. I did great in C and Computer Architecture course back in college, have read books like c primer, effective c. I have no problem understanding copyreferencepointer individually, but not quite fluent and confident to make proper use of them in practice.p  pHere are two cases, for simplicity, just ignore other concepts like move, const, overloads, inheritance, smart pointer etc. Most of my problems are about copy or reference copy or pointerp  ol lipAs class member field. In Java or C, things are more like pointer A and B can have the samedifferent C member, If you have same C in A and B, when you change C in A, C in B also get changed. It is common that one object shared by more than one objects. Is pointer a must in this case But using pointers introduce much more complexity in C code, even with smart pointer.pli lipAs class method return. Looks like reference is preferred. It avoids copy and the behavior is what I am used to return Fooamp from a method while the actual Foo is in one class and possibly shared among classes. Whatever made to that Fooamp later on apply to its owner and other users. But how do I guarantee the reference is valid It is unlike JavaC with GC, as long as it is been used, it is there. Is it possible I get an Fooamp to a Bars member, then lots of things may happen to that Fooamp, through class or functions but some how the Bar get destroyed end of scope on stack or deleted on heap C object lifetime are deterministic, ironically, that makes me uncertain about whether a references object is still alivepli ol  pTo sum up, the mix of possible unnecessary copies, pointers memory management and uncertainty of object lifetime is my trouble. Are there any guidelines and good practices for my problemp

Negative 511 pI have been looking into updating an existing codebase to better follow design patterns, principals, handle unit testing, separating concerns, etc. I am new to implementing a lot of these concepts so I am still doing a lot of research and trying to see how they could be implemented in the current codebase.p  pCurrently each business entity has its own vb file. Within that vb file contains the entity, entity collection, and entity dalc classes for that entity. If you want to perform a database operation on the entity you would do so by calling Enity.Save, Entity.Delete, etc. These methods on the entity class would create the entity dalc object and then call the Save, Delete, etc. method on the entity dalc object. The dalc would then call a Save, Delete, etc. stored procedure through a SqlHelper class that handles the low level stuff.p  pEach entity class requires a Location object to be passed into its constructor. This object is used to know what database the user is logged into as well as create the appropriate connection string to the database. The databases all have the same schema they just have different names and can live on different SQL instances. Basically each client has their own database and the Location object hits up a shared database to find out what SQL instance the client needs to connect to based on the clients name which is stored in a cookie.p  pI have been looking into a more ModelRepositoryService approach but the Location object is throwing me off, especially since it too needs to access the database to get the information it needs to create the correct connection string. The repository objects need the connection string, but all of the examples I have seen have it hardcoded in the class. I am thinking the repository objects will need to take in an interface of the Location object but Im not sure if the MVC project would do that directly or pass it into the service objects and they would handle it. At what point does the Location object get created, since it too needs to access the database in order for it to create the connection string, how does it get createdp  pI am also not clear on how the MVC project would interact with the Service and Repository layers. It seems like everything should run through the service objects, but for testing you would want them to take in an interface for the repository. Doing this would mean the MVC project would need to pass in the repository object, but it doesnt seem like the MVC project should know about the repository objects. However, if you are just doing basic CRUD it seems like it would be simpler to have the MVC project directly call those methods on the repository objects instead of running them through a service object.p  pHere is an example of what I am currently looking into. The plan is to use ADO.NET and SQL Server for now but possibly switch to an ORM or even a different SQL backend in the future. I am hoping the ModelRepositoryService approach will make it easy to make those changes in the future so if not feel free to offer advice on that as well.p  pstrongProject.Modelstrongp  precodepublic class Person      public int Id     public string Name  codepre  pstrongProject.Repositorystrongp  precodepublic class PersonRepository      public Person FindByIdint id               Connect to the database based on the Locations connection string       codepre  pstrongProject.Servicestrongp  precodepublic class PersonService      private IPersonRepository personRepository       Should this even take in the repository object     public PersonServiceIPersonRepository personRepository              personRepository  personRepository            Should the MVC project call this directly on the repository object     public Person FindByIdint id              return personRepository.FindByIdid       codepre  pstrongProject.MCVstrongp  precode I think the Location object needs to come from here, as the client name is  in the cookie.

Negative 511 pstrongSummarystrong I havent found any option of sending POST requests via Ember Data, and would really appreciate your sophisticated help. The a hrefhttpemberjs.joefiorini.comguidesmodelstherestadapter relnofollowdocumentationa says one should use the Create function, but there are no examples for it anywhere. You dont have to read the entire details here, this is my major question.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong I want that as soon as the user logs in with a Facebook login, his signedRequest would be sent to the RESTful server and it will send back a JSON that would provide more information about him from my database.p  pstrongMy architecturestrong By my research Ive discovered that signedRequest is the prefered way compare to accessToken to make this secure and quick, because it does not rely on any further Facebook Server check and therefore decreases the IO. It only depands on AppId And AppSecret for decoding. Security and agility are important to me due to the RESTful architecture in which authentication should be done per each communication am I wrong.p  pstrongWhat Iv succeededstrong Ive managed to make the facebook login and the decoding logic of the signedRequest. If this is the first login, the logic on the server will insert him to the database.p  pstrongThe problemstrong At first I made a GET request to the Web API Ive prepared with the signedRequest, it worked well untill I had concated a longstring and then got NetworkError 400 Bad Request.p  precodeApp.UserController  Ember.ObjectController.extend FBSignedRequest non,   actions      login function         this.setFBSignedRequest, FBApp.FBUser.signedRequest         this.store.finduser, this.getFBSignedRequest want to make it POST          codepre  pThe GET request was something likep  precodehttplocalhost54441apiusersiAMveRyLongStrINgWHichRepreSEnTsASignEDReQueSt codepre  pThen I thought to myself that this is because of the complexity of the signedRequest, so the second way is to make it POST request.

Negative 511 pI want to get the dominant color in an Android CvCameraViewFrame object. I use the following OpenCV Android code to do that.

Negative 511 pIm trying to write a iOS note taking app that is blazingly fast for a large number of notes and that syncs without ever blocking the UI. Dont worry, its just a learning project, I know there are a billion note apps for iOS. I have decided to use Core Data mostly because of the excellent posts by a hrefhttpinessential.com relnofollowBrent Simmonsa about a hrefhttpvesperapp.co relnofollowVespera. I know UIManagedDocument can do async reads and writes and has a lot of functionality built in, so Im wondering if there is any information on which would be faster for a fairly simple notes app. I cant really find a lot of information about people using UIManagedDocuments for anything other than a centralized, basically singleton, persistent store. Is it suitable for 1000s of documents Would it be faster or slower than just a database of NSManagedObjects It seems like most information I can find about Core Data is oriented towards people using NSManagedObject, so any information about UIManagedDocuments being used in production apps would be really helpful. At this point, the only thing I can think of is to just write the whole app both ways, load 10,000 notes into it, and see what happens.p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr To clarify, Im not learning iOS development and ObjectiveC, the learning project mostly means that Ive never used Core Data and would like to learn how to write a really performant Core Data application.p

Negative 511 pI am trying to add a form request to my page that will return some HTML to the user through an AJAX call. I am using CakePHP framework and the built in helpers to do an AJAX request. Ive tried multiple ways of performing the request and returning the HTML that comes back to a response DIV. But it appears there are some heavy issues that prevent you from calling an external page and returning it.p  pI know my GET query is working correctly because I can copy the firebug request location into a browser and get the proper formatted response page.p  pFrom the searching Ive done Ive gathered that you arent allowed to do cross browser requests and you have to do some sort of redirect from your controller. Ive tried several things without success there as well. If I simply change my ajax request to a local controller action it does work. But I need to display the request response from my external page that returns data from another server. I have control of both servers and pages.p  pWhat is the proper way to set this up in CakePHPp

Negative 511 pI am trying to extract amplitude information from a sound loaded from a URL using the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAudioAPI relnofollowWeb Audio APIa instantaneously not in real time, which will likely require the codeOfflineAudioContextcode. I am expecting to obtain something along the lines of an array containing the amplitude of the sound every codetcode seconds for the duration of the sound with size depending on the duration of the sound, divided by codetcode. Unfortunately, documentation is sparse at this point, and Im unsure of how to proceed. How can I load the sound and extract the amplitude every codetcode secondsp

It appears that the width and height I am getting are as if the phone is still portrait, and worth noting it appears that the removal of the action bar has also been taken into account.p  pSorry for the long question but I thought it best to show all the code.

Try it in Chrome and IE to see the difference in resultsp  pIm attempting to use css3 transformationstransitions because, well, theyre much more fluid than the jquery effects.p  pI have a mobile version of a site that has a fixed bar at the top with the logo on it and a navicon. When the navicon is clicked or touched, a side navigation bar pops out from the left.p  pThis is where css3 comes in. I had a working version of this functionality with jQuery alone, but the animation was really choppy on phones. I downloaded the jQuery transit plugin, which basically integrates css3 transitions into jQuery as if they were animations but this is beside the point  I dont think the problem lies here. p  pWith the css3 version, when I move my content body and my fixed header with x [some amount], the transformation shows differently for different browsers. In every desktop browser with the exception of IE10, the fixed header flies out double what it should, while the content body shifts to the right the right amount. In my phone, in chrome, the header flies out double what it should while not doing so in the default Android browser.p  pMore info I checked with chrome inspector, and both the header and the content body are receiving the same transformation [some number]px, 0. THE HEADER IS NESTED WITHIN THE CONTENT BODY. I think thats where the problem lies. Some browsers move the header with the content, and then interpret the transformation of the header again. On the other hand, since the position is fixed, some browsers interpret the two transformations independently.p  pMy question What technicalities cause this discrepancy and what can be done to get consistent results across all modern browsersp  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ionickgoflypenDHFbv relnofollowCodepena Like I said, on Chrome it doesnt work as expected but if you try IE it doesp

Negative 511 pSo I am trying to make a project that mirrors Rubys Gosu gem, a 2d graphics plugin. To do this, I have created a class called Window, which is intended to be inherited from class Game public Window, and then have three of its functions defined codeUpdatecode codeControlscode and codeDrawcode.p  pTo accomplish this in my window class I have a defined function codeShowcode which looks like thisp  precode    void WindowShow              stuff to initialize and set up my window and controls             glutTimerFunc100,realupdate,fps       codepre  pAnd my coderealupdatecode function is simplyp  precode    void Windowrealupdateint v             glutPostRedisplay             Update             glutTimerFunc1000fps,realupdate,v      codepre  pThe logic here is that whatever class inherits codeWindowcode, will be able to call codeShowcode, which will set up the call back loop and initialize the window, then in the coderealupdatecode loop it will call the codeUpdatecode which will be defined in the child class. p  pHowever, when I create a simple child class, define codeUpdatecode in the child class to just indicate it is being called, and then call Show on an instance of the child class it will only ever call the base classs Window definition for codeUpdatecode.p  pIm certain this is a misunderstanding with inheritance, but I do not understand why. I thought that the child class call to codeShowcode would call the base classs definition which then calls codeUpdatecode, which has been changed since the child class redefines it. p

Negative 511 pBased on OpenCL guide for Mali 600 gpu, CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR should be used to remove any data copy and to improve performance.p  pToday, I was testing on memory copy time using CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR on Arndale board having a Mali 604 gpu. I tested with CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR and with clEnqueueWriteBuffer. I found that overall I do not get much performance improvement if I use CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR. Because the clEnqueueMap function takes almost same time as clEnqueueWriteBuffer. This test has been done on vector addition.p  pHow I tested Instead of having a pointer created with malloc and transfer data to device, I created a buffer at first using CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR . Then I mapped this buffer using OpenCL API. This returns a pointer and I filled the memory pointed by this pointer with data. The mapping mechanism in this case takes time. The mapping time is almost equal to clENqueuewritebuffer. So, from this example, I did not get any significant improvement using  CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR.p  pstrongMy question is, why mapping time is so big when I use CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTRstrongp  pHere is the performance measurements Element size 10000000, Kernel  vector addition, All times are in microsecondsp  pNormal read write buffer    time buffer creation time    20 enqueue write buffer time   108019p  pCLMEMALLOCHOSTPTRwith direct data copying inside allocated buffer  time Filling the pointer returned by clEnqueueMap with data  208009 mapping time    81346 unmapping time  269p  pCLMEMALLOCHOSTPTRwith data copying from a malloc pointer to host alloc pointer using memcpy    Time mapping time    64134 unmapping time  190 memcpy time copy data from already created malloc pointer  to host allocated pinned pointerbr 56987p  pHere is the code snippet I used for Hostallocptrp  precodestart  getTime     astgetTime     bufferA  clCreateBuffercontext,  CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR, sizeofclfloat  ELENUM, NULL, amperr     clfloat srcaclfloatclEnqueueMapBuffercommandQueue, bufferA,CLTRUE,CLMAPWRITE, 0, sizeofclfloat  ELENUM, 0, NULL, NULL, amperr      bufferB  clCreateBuffercontext, CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR, sizeofclfloat  ELENUM, NULL, amperr     clfloat srcbclfloatclEnqueueMapBuffercommandQueue, bufferB,CLTRUE,CLMAPWRITE, 0, sizeofclfloat  ELENUM, 0, NULL, NULL, amperr     clFinishcommandQueue     aengetTime     atimeatimeaenast      pfillsgetTime     for int i  0 i lt ELENUM i         srca[i]  100.0         srcb[i]  11.1           pfillegetTime     pfilltimepfilltimepfillepfills      bstgetTime     clEnqueueUnmapMemObjectcommandQueue, bufferB, srcb, 0, NULL, NULL     clEnqueueUnmapMemObjectcommandQueue, bufferA, srca, 0, NULL, NULL     clFinishcommandQueue     bengetTime     btimebtimebenbst       end  getTime     creatbuffer  endstart     bufferC  clCreateBuffercontext, CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR, sizeofclfloat  ELENUM, NULL, amperr codepre
Negative 511 pGuys i wanna know if there is a way for thisp  pIf the first question for example in select tag is brand of car. then you select for example toyota. The next select option for the next option are the list of cars for toyota like camry, fortuner, etc. and if on the first selection you choose honda the next select option will have civic, crz, crv etc.. p  pso basically the next select tag switches option depending on the first option selected. and the biggest question is if the code is for HTML only not with CSS.

Negative 511 pLinux allows the user to change the system swappiness from 0 to 100. If set to 0, the kernel will disable swapping and all processes will be maintained in memory if spared memory is available. Conversely, if set to 100, the kernel will swap aggressively. My question is, why not always setting the swappiness to 0 As a system user, we may always expect our programs to be maintained in memory rather than swapped to disk. So I think setting the swappiness to 100 is meaningless, correctp

Negative 511 pI have a pretty unique problem.

The effect Im trying to get is thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBK4QO.png width320p  pWhat I have is this ignore the search barp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNrdY4.png width320p  pThe problem that I have is that when you click on any of the tabs in my nav bar public for example, the click doesnt register, and it clicks whatever is underneath instead.  For example, if I click Munchies, it will click the search bar underneath the tab.  Also, even if there is nothing clickable underneath it Ive tried this with a blank UIViewController, the tabs eg Munchies are still not clickable. p  pI have a theory for why this is.  If I raise the tabs by a few pixels, the tops of the tabs become clickable.  So, I think the navigationBar has a frame within which you can interact with its objects, but if you interact with anything outside of that frame, it interacts with lower layers.  Ive tried expanding the nav bar height and it doesnt work Ive looked it up and its against the rules.  p  pAny thoughtsp  pThanksp

Negative 511 pI use the AclFileAttributeView from Java7 to read the folder permissions of a Windows directory. The problem is that Im not able to get a complete overview because the AclFileAttributeView doesnt return generic permissions like GENERICALL, GENERICWRITE, GENERICREAD and GENERICEXECUTE the four highorder bits in the access mask. In fact, when it comes to generic permissions it gives me wrong information about other AclEntries for the same member. Let me give an examplep  pWhen I use a tool like AccessChk to list the AclEntries of cwindows for the System account I get the followingp  precode[2] ACCESSALLOWEDACETYPE NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM   FILEADDFILE   FILEADDSUBDIRECTORY   FILELISTDIRECTORY   FILEREADATTRIBUTES   FILEREADEA   FILETRAVERSE   FILEWRITEATTRIBUTES   FILEWRITEEA   DELETE   SYNCHRONIZE   READCONTROL [3] ACCESSALLOWEDACETYPE NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM     [OBJECTINHERITACE]     [CONTAINERINHERITACE]     [INHERITONLYACE]   GENERICALL codepre  pAs you can see the first AclEntry only applies to the folder itself and has bnotb the special permissions WRITEACL and WRITEOWNER. The second AclEntry applies only to subfolders and files and contains the generic permission GENERICALL. This is exactly how I see it in the Security tab of Windows Explorer. Two records for the System account, one applies only to the folder with a subset of permissions and one applies to subfoldersfiles with Full control.p  pNow I run my java program using the following codep  precodeAclFileAttributeView view  Files.getFileAttributeViewpath, AclFileAttributeView.class System.out.printlnview.getAcl codepre  pThis gives my the following results for the System accountp  ul liNT AUTHORITYSYSTEMREADDATAWRITEDATAAPPENDDATAREADNAMEDATTRSWRITENAMEDATTRSEXECUTEDELETECHILDREADATTRIBUTESWRITEATTRIBUTESDELETEREADACLWRITEACLWRITEOWNERSYNCHRONIZEALLOWli liNT AUTHORITYSYSTEMFILEINHERITDIRECTORYINHERITINHERITONLYALLOWli ul  pThe first AclEntry applies only to the folder itself and contains ballb the special permissions, including WRITEACL and WRITEOWNER, which is not correct The second AclEntry doesnt show any permissions, because it has GENERICALL on itp  pIm not sure where this goes wrong, it seems the JRE just decodes the ACE bitmask given by the OS sun.nio.fs.WindowsSecurityDescriptor.decode. p  pHas anyone experienced these same issues I will try some other JREs, perhaps that makes a difference.p

This would trigger the showone function. p  pI dont know how to do this though, and after a fair bit of searching, Im more confused than I was to begin with. p  pThe reason Im using JavaScript to begin with, is that the page cant refresh.

Negative 511 pnI am developing a Spring MVC web app using Spring 3.2. We will deploy the web app to different customers. Each customer may use one of several implementations of a service interface.p  pIts possible that the customer may need to reset these values, so we cant just hardwire the implementation into the application, it needs to be externally configurable.

Negative 511 pI wanted to try using a hrefhttpwww.polymerproject.org relnofollowpolymera as Im really excited about Material Design and this seemed a great way to embrace that design philosophy as well as some other aspects of it, like data binding so I decided to start swapping in polymer elements for the html ones.p  pThe problem is that after changing inputs, checkboxes, and dropdowns to paperinputs, papercheckboxes, and paperdropdownmenus, the page loads freaking slowly.

Negative 511 pWhen I run my app on emiOS 7 things work as expectedem. When I run my app on emiOS 8 things do NOTem work as expected. This is all without making a single edit to the codebase.p  pSpecifically, Im trying to push a new view controller on the stack and emin iOS 8 nothing happensem. lt Thats the bug, nothing happens. No crash, just nothing.p  pAt first I thought it might be storyboard related and so switched from triggering my push segue via codeperformSegueWithIdentifiercode to just manually loading it from the storyboard using codeinstantiateViewControllerWithIdentifiercode and then presenting it via code[self.navigationController pushViewControllermyVC animatedYES]code.p  pEither of the above techniques works on iOS 7. emHowever, BOTH approaches fail when running my app on an iOS 8 deviceem.

Negative 511 pI have a form with a textbox that is stretched to most part of the form. Then I added a picture box to the form which will be visible on certain conditions on top of the text box by calling BringToFront on the control.p  pWhen I resize the form while running my application, the picture boxs location does not change according to the form size. It always stays in one location. Is there any property that helps to keep the picture box always in the middle of the form.p  pThank youp

I have all of this working fine, except for the priority control. p  pEdit in response to Jeremy, moved from commentsp  pOk, suppose you have a devicefilewhatever like a printer. A print job  consists of multiple function callsblocks print header, then print figure, then print text,... grouped together in a transaction. Put these blocks on a serial queue. One queue per transaction.p  pHowever you can have multiple print jobstransactions. Blocks from different print jobstransactions can not be mixed. So how do you ensure that a transaction queue runs all of its jobs and that a transaction queue is not started before another queue has finished I am not printing, just using this as an example. p  pSemaphores are used to regulate the use of finite resources. a hrefhttpswww.mikeash.compyblogfridayqa20090925gcdpracticum.html relnofollowhttpswww.mikeash.compyblogfridayqa20090925gcdpracticum.htmla a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualConcurrencyProgrammingGuideOperationQueuesOperationQueues.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40008091CH102SW24 relnofollowConcurrency Programming Guidea p  pThe next step I am trying to figure out is how to run one transaction before another.p

Negative 511 pI am working on silverlight datagrid to show some records. In Second column cell template i have control whose Mouse Enter event makes a server call and a DB call to fetch some string based on datakey that is displayed as a tootip on the column. So the tooltip is different for most of the rows.The issue i am facing is sometime tooltip does not appear on UI at all. For example, i just put the mouse pointer at row n, wait for 5 minutes, tooltip does not appear at all. I move the mouse pointer to row n1 its tooltip appears and when i move the focus back to row n, its tooltip also becomes visible now. I am not able to understand why it did not show previously.p  pAny help or suggestion on how to fix or any alternate approach to achieve this is much Appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p

So I dont understand why Im getting an Apache port error. p  pAnyway, next I opened Activity Monitor and killed every httpd and mysqld process that was running and restarted MAMP but, the problem persisted.  The mysqld process never reappeared after I killed it the first time. p  pThen, I searched SO.  I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26124504mampproapachecouldntbestartedbecausetheportwasalreadyinusea posta regarding MAMP PRO and decided to try the suggested solutions but, to no avail.  Same goes for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23245096mamp3apachewontstartonport8888this postas suggestion to delete and reinstall the entire application.  p  pBy now I cant tell if the mysql error is causing the apache error or if the apache error is causing the mysql error.  So, I searched and tried several solutions regarding the mysql error including suggestions from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16133467mampphpmyadmin2002cantconnecttolocalmysqlserverthroughsocketathis posta, and a hrefhttpwww.techrecipes.comrx762solvecantconnecttolocalmysqlserverthroughsockettmpmysqlsock relnofollowthis posta, but none of them worked for me. I mean, I literally tried every single suggestion on those pages, from the posted answers to the comments. p  pIve also tried restarting my computer, changing the apache, nginx and mysql port configuration settings, switching from apache to nginx, loading MAMPs MySql from Terminal, creating a my.cnf file with the socket configuration.  None of which have worked. p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this Is it an Apache port error or a MySQL socket error  Or something totally different  And considering that there were no updates installed or changes to anything in the system or application, what could have caused thisp  pThanks in advance. p  pstrong Edit December 10, 2014strong br So I played around with this all night.  I reinstalled the application a couple of times.  Installed some updates and even copied my laptops MAMP setup, which works, to my desktop.  But, I still got the same errors.  Then I changed MAMPs document root back to the default codeMac HD gt Applications gt MAMP gt htdocscode and it worked  I had previously set it to codeUsersuserhomedirectorySitescode.p  pI posted this as an edit instead of an answer because the problem still exists. Changing the document root back to codeUsersmyhomedirectorySitescode gives me the same error messages as before so my solution is more of a workaround.  Hopefully this sets off a lightbulb for someone because I still cant figure out what could be the cause andor solution. p

Negative 511 pReading the a hrefhttpstevedore.readthedocs.orgenlatestindex.html relnofollowstevedore doca, it seems that any plugin needs to have a setup.py file and be installed to be discoverable.p  pBut if you want to load modules in your Python path by just putting the module name in a conf file, like you do with Django INSTALLEDAPPS, how would you do p  pWriting a setup.py for all your submodules seem really overkill, espacially if you got lots of small modules. And requiring that from beginers so they can hack a quick script for your app your app make a biggest learning curve.p

Negative 511 pIm new to Android and have been working on this app for a while.  Pretty much Im loading initial values into the sqlite database with 3 columns id, product, and ingredients.  I have an EditText box for the user to search the products to see if they have a certain ingredient in it.  A listview is then printed out showing the products with these ingredients.  Im having some overall trouble with this code, specifically when I run it, it shows Could not read row 0 col 1 from logcat.  p  pUpdate Thanks to Todd I fixed my original Could not read row 0 and col 1 problem but now when I click the search button with edit text input Apple which should output one product, the app doesnt update and stays static.

Negative 511 pI am trying to calculate height of UITableViewCells. I have this working creating a prototype cell instance from a dynamic prototype configured in the storyboard by calling dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier on the UITableView and then calling systemLayoutSizeFittingSize on the cell prototype. The problem is that the traitCollection and the constraints configured in the storyboard for the cell are always what I have set for AnyAny and the frame of the cell is always 320pt wide. This seems wrong. Is there something Im missing Is there some other way I should be laying out the cells to use size classes and instantiating them Cells created using dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierforIndexPath have the correct traitCollection and constraint values, but I obviously cant use that to create a prototype cell to calculate cell height as it triggers a call to tableViewheightForRowAtIndexPath.p

Negative 511 pI am trying to understand how exactly the Async File IO java.nio.AsyncFileChannel in Java 8 works. p  pMy specific question is, does the AsyncFileChannel internally uses a pool of threads and does a blocking wait OR uses system calls to let kernel notify when the IO task is finished. I know there may be subtle variations per implementation, but whats the most widely used approach.p  pAlso, I will be highly obliged if I can get reference to designimplementation docs for the nio package, specifically the AsyncIO part.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 511 pI have built a very simple rails blog that is based on therapylike sessions in real life. At the end of every blog post, a user can vote on the post where it says How does that make you feelp  pI am nearly finished developing the application but I cant figure out how to make an expanded voting system.p  pThere are 6 different emotion options that the user needs to be able to vote with Happy, Sad, Angry, Inspired, Boring, Anxious. This means that one vote is not in any way better than the other. There are no positive and negative votes. Theyre just different.p  pSo far, all the gems and tutorials I have come across feature a voting system that consists of two options. I need a way to implement 6.p  pLastly, I would like to be able to count all of the total emotions belonging to a particular blog post and display the emotion with the most votes next to the title. p  pHas anyone ever tried something like this After I figure out how to do this, I would like to make it into a gem if there isnt already one.p

Negative 511 pI am trying to build an API to allow users to upload a file along with some information like FileName, Description, Category and AccessPermissions. I am able to get this working using MultipartFormDataStreamProvider. But, I would like to implement some serverside validations on the data and the file. For example, restricting the type of files to only text [.txt] and image [.jpg, .png and .bmp] and making sure FileName is not empty. I can do it, atleast the FileName check, now after I read the stream. Is there a way to do this without reading the entire streamp  pThanks.p

Negative 511 pI have a large scale multi objective optimization problem  to solve with codefminconcode solver of codeMatlabcode. I tried different solver to get a better and faster output. Here is the challenge   p  pI am getting codeExit Flag 1,0,4,5code for different Pareto points ,as it is a multiobjective optimization problem, with codeActiveset algorithmcode. Then I tried to check different algorithms like codeinteriorpointcode and codesqpcode for generating the Pareto points. I observed that codesqpcode returns few codeexit flags 1code, some code2code and few code0code but not any code4code or code5code codeflagcode. Also, I should note that, its code0code and code2code flagged solutions are correct answers . However, When it comes to return any codeexit flagcode except code1code, it takes a long time to solve the Pareto point.  p  pAs codeinteriorpointcode algorithm is designed for large scale program, its very faster than codesqpcode in generating the Pareto solutions. However, it only returns solutions with codeExit flag 0code. Unfortunately, its code0code flagged solutions are wrong solutions despite  codesqpcode which its code0code and code2code flagged solutions are correct answers. 0 Is there anyway to config the codefminconcode to solve my problem with codeinteriorpointcode and also get the correct solutions In the literature I saw some problems similar to mine have been solved with codeinteriorpointcode algorithm.p  p1 Is there any settings codeTolX,TolCon,...code that I can use to get more codeexit flag 1code p  p2 Is there any setting that speeds up the optimization process with the cost of lower accuracyp  p3 For 2 Pareto points I am getting exit flag 2 , which means the problem is not feasible for them. It is expected from the nature of the problem. But it takes ages for codefminconcode to determine the  ExitFlag 2.  Is there any option that I can set to satisfy 1,2 and also leave this infeasible point faster  I couldnt do this , because I can only set options for one time and all Pareto points should use the same option.  p  pTo describe the problem I should saybr I have several linear and nonlinear code.2,Sin...code for both equality and inequality constraints about code300code and also having code400code optimization variables. All objective functions of this multiobjective optimization problem is linear. p  pthese are the options that I currently use. Please help me to modify itp  precode options  optimsetAlgorithm, sqp, Display, off    options  optimsetAlgorithm, sqp, Display, off, TolX,1e6,...   TolFun,1e6,MaxIter,1e2, MaxFunEvals, 1e4 codepre  pFirst option takes about code500 seccode for generating code15code Pareto points. Meaning that each optimization of codefminconcode expend code33 seccode.br The second option takes code200 seccode, which is code13 seccode for each optimization of codefminconcode.p  pYour help will be highly appreciated.p
Negative 511 pGood Afternoon,p  pI have a Joomla website Joomla 3.4.1 hosted on a Windows server. Ive found that, even with compression enabled within Joomla itself, the compression doesnt appear to be working or recognized by speed tests. Im guessing this may be something related to the Windows server and its configurations, but Im not sure what it could be. Does anyone have thoughts on what I may be able to configure within Windows to allow the compression to work correctlyp  pFor referencep  ol liI have tried to first enable the compression options that are built into the template framework. These are Minify  Data URIs  Gzip. I dont receive any errors when enabling but my speed tests dont change and compression isnt recognized.li liI also tried enabling the Joomla core cache and Gzip compression in Global Configuration. Same thing here as the tests I ran didnt recognize any compression or caching.li ol

This worked for half an hour, and then I got the same problem Than, deleting tomcat doesnt help.  What is weird is the the service in the DAO starts with get and not find. I thought that maybe tomcat is confused, so I changed get to fetch. Didnt help. I read here that instead of writing 1 I should write text. But understand that writing with  worked for over a year, so I have MANY parameters with   too much work for an annoying bug it worked for over a year.

Negative 511 pIm pulling whats remaining of my hair out trying to get something to work in Silverlight that works out of the box in WPF.p  pI have some CheckBoxes on a form which represent items  The Checked property is bound to a bool in my ViewModel one viewmodel per item. When the checkbox is checked it adds the item to a list in another ViewModel  before this happens I want to perform some validation in my case count how many items are in the list in the other ViewModel, and if its reached a limit show the user a message and if this validation fails dont add it to the list and uncheck the box. When it runs, after the validation check is done in the bool property setter I can see the value set back to false, but this is not reflected back in the CheckBox in the UI in Silverlight so the CheckBox remains checked.

Negative 511 pIm trying to create a loginlogout mechanism using Facebook. So far Ive managed to edit the default Javascript SDK with basic JS knowledge to only display the logout link if the user is logged in. However the Login Button persists regardless of whether the user is logged in or not. Here is the codep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtFacebook Login JavaScript Examplelttitlegt ltmeta charsetUTF8gt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltscriptgt    This is called with the results from from FB.getLoginStatus.   function statusChangeCallbackresponse      console.logstatusChangeCallback     console.logresponse      The response object is returned with a status field that lets the      app know the current login status of the person.      Full docs on the response object can be found in the documentation      for FB.getLoginStatus.     if response.status  connected         Logged into your app and Facebook.       testAPI      else if response.status  notauthorized         The person is logged into Facebook, but not your app.       document.getElementByIdstatus.innerHTML  Please log           into this app.      else         The person is not logged into Facebook, so were not sure if        they are logged into this app or not.       document.getElementByIdstatus.innerHTML  Please log           into Facebook.             This function is called when someone finishes with the Login    Button.  See the onlogin handler attached to it in the sample    code below.   function checkLoginState      FB.getLoginStatusfunctionresponse        statusChangeCallbackresponse            window.fbAsyncInit  function    FB.init     appId       1467517133547158,     cookie      true,   enable cookies to allow the server to access                           the session     xfbml       true,   parse social plugins on this page     version     v2.2  use version 2.2        Now that weve initialized the JavaScript SDK, we call     FB.getLoginStatus.  This function gets the state of the    person visiting this page and can return one of three states to    the callback you provide.  They can be       1. Logged into your app connected    2. Logged into Facebook, but not your app notauthorized    3. Not logged into Facebook and cant tell if they are logged into       your app or not.

Negative 511 pSo I am working on a homework assignment that requires us to take an integer array and create a parallel array of pointers that will then point to the corresponding element in the original array.

Italy has only Trend A etc.p  pIs it possible to write php code and in some way auto generate the table headers based on the query resultsp  pAnd then split the results by trend so that correct values will go to correct trendp  pI know how to do a simple table likep  precodesqlr  SELECT o.id, o.code, tl.name, ts.items, ts.revenue           FROM overview o, trendstats ts, trendlang tl                                WHERE o.idshop  1                     AND o.id  ts.id                     AND ts.idtrend  tl.idtrend datatooutput  DbgetInstancegtExecuteSsqlr  foreach datatooutput as data      echo          lttrgt         lttdgt.data[id].lttdgt         lttdgt.data[code].lttdgt         lttdgt.data[trend].lttdgt         lttdgt.data[items].lttdgt         lttdgt.data[revenue].lttdgt         lttrgt            codepre  pBut Im not sure how to split and structure them the way I want them to be.

Negative 511 pIm writing a tinyc Compiler which translates into MIPS assembly. Im stuck with the question how to implement the local variable handling. The following example makes it hard to think of a proper solutionp  precodeint funcA      int a  3     return ampa   int main      return funcA  codepre  pNormally you would create the local variable on the stack. So in this case int a would be created on the stack. The problem is that in the end we want to return the address of a and not the value with ampa. But in the moment we leave funcA we reset the stack to the old state and the pointer we return in the end is not valid anymore and could show later into nirvana.p  pMy first attempt was to handle everything with registers, but with the ampOperator we translate it to something like thisp  precode    .globl funcA funcA     addiu   sp, sp, 4   save return address     sw      ra, sp     addiu   sp, sp, 4   save the reg we will use for further processing     sw      s0, sp     addiu   t0, zero, 3  t0  a and add 3     la      s0, t0     la      t0, s0     sw      t1, t0     crashes here     la      v0, t1     put the result in v0     lw      s0, sp     addiu   sp, sp, 4    restore the stack     lw      ra, sp     addiu   sp, sp, 4     jr      ra            jump back codepre  pIt would crash in the marked line because the destination register doesnt have an address to store something. One idea is to to create a datasegment for every local variable, but that would be a overhead and it wouldnt work with recursive functions.p  pDoes anyone have a proper solution how to handle local variables especially if you return an address from a local variable and not a valuep  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 511 pI have a table structure like thisp  pParentObjectObjectId string,.....p  pChildObjectObjectId string, ParentId String, Atribute1 String, State Integer....p  pThere are multiple ParentObject recordsnearly 1000 and each ParentObject record table is referenced by multiple recordsnearly 50 in ChildObject table.p  pI have two parallel processes running on different machines which execute this query in a loop using OCI library calls. code UPDATE ChildObject SET Attribute1ltprocessnamegt WHERE ObjectId  ANY     SELECT TOP 100 ObjectId FROM ChildObject alias1 WHERE State  0        AND NOT EXISTS          SELECT  FROM ChildObject alias2 WHERE alias2.State  0 AND              alias2.Attribute1 ltgt   AND alias2.ParentId  alias1.ParentId codep  pThe syntax might not be perfect. The logic is that each process updates 100 ChildObject records in a run and sets Attribute1 to the Process nameif not already set, sleeps for some time and starts the update again.p  pMy Requirement is that all the ChildObject records referencing to the same ParentObject record should be updated by one process. For example, if Process1 updates 10 records of ChildObject that have the same ParentId, the remaining records of ChildObject that have the same ParentId should be updated by Process1 and not by Process2.p  pSince the processes are running parallely, some of the ChildObject records are updated in one process and some of the ChildObject records having the same ParentId are updated in the other process. p  pSelect.. For Update doesnt work in my case because the update happens on different records in the ChildObject table.p  pLocking the entire ChildObject table might not be a good solution.p  pCan you please suggest me how to achieve this synchronizationp  pThanks,p  pVanathip

This question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2057227csharpaspnetsendemailviatlsC ASP.NET Send Email via TLSa raises the point that not all SMTP servers support TLS but the fact is, Im unsure about the relationship between port, SSL and TLS.

Negative 511 pI have a UIButton created in interface builder, that Im turning into a circle by setting codebutton.layer.borderRadius  button.frame.size.width  2.0code programatically, in viewDidAppear. However, the viewController it belongs to is presented modally with an animation. Since codeviewDidAppearcode isnt called until after the transition animation has finished, the button is square until then, which makes the sudden change quite jarring. p  pI cant set the radius in codeviewDidLoadcode, since the button properties are incorrect then the width is too large, which I think is because autolayout constraints havent been properly resolved yet. I tried to rectify this by calling code[self.view setNeedsLayout]code in codeviewDidLoadcode, and then setting the cornerRadius, but the button width was still wrong.

Negative 511 pI have a maddeningly simple task and be patient with me, Im new to all this I have a div with a table inside, and the table contains one row and two cells, sidebyside. One cell contains header text, the next cell contains a paragraph of body text. It looks great on large screens, bad on small ones. So when the viewport width goes below 890px, I want to pile the two on top of each other by breaking the cells into two different rows.p  pFirst, just let me say that, yes, I have to use the table. I know using tables for layout is clunky, but its necessary for vertically centering everything inside the div.p  pSo my solution to this problem was to write some JQuery that would take the current contents of the table, fetched using the codehtmlcode method, compare them to the initial state contents of the table at larger viewport widths, and then replace the contents with a final state string that just has codelttrgtlttrgtcode inserted after the first cells codelttdgtcode tag.p  pThe variable containing the initial state table contents is exactly the same as the table contents returned by the codehtmlcode method but with codencode at the end of each line except the last the extra backslash to tell JS that its a multiline string. I ran a codestrcmpcode on the strings in MATLAB to ensure I didnt make any stupid mistakes, came back true. And when I ask JS to print both strings to the console, they look identical. But when I ask JS if theyre codecode, I get a false.p  pSo I made a second variable for the initial state with coderncode instead of codencode because I read that some browsers do newlines differently. Checked if the current table contents were equal to either of them. Nope.p  pWhats going on herep

Negative 511 pI am attempting to conduct operations on rows of matrices in a list format to calculate portions of a Hessian matrix mixed partial derivatives matrix for some software I am writing. I found that I could only do this so fast in R even with parallelization, and so have switched over to Rcpp for quicker speed and RcppEigen for the high level matrix operations provided. When I have relied on the List type for representing lists of matricesvectors passed from R, my Cpp code slows down tremendously as the length of the lists each element being a matrix or vector increases. I am not sure exactly why, but it may be because of dynamically sized objects My questions is Can I pass a list from R into a vector container from the Standard Template Library STL using RcppEigen via something like the followingp  precodevectorltEigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgtgt AasltvectorltEigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgtgt gtAA  codepre  pThe reason I want to do so is because I have read that accessing vectors is much faster than accessing lists. However, I may have misinterpreted this and I apologize if so.p  pThe idea is to pass in a list of vectors B2 and a list of matrices A2. Within each index of these lists, I iterate over the rows of the matrix A in the current index of A2 and the vector b in the current index of B2, calculatingp  pb[j]  tA[j,]  A[j,]p  pfor j from 0 to rows1. I would end up with a list with size equal to the number of rows of the matrix in that index, then move on to the next index of the outer limit, etc.  p  pHere is a reproducible example of what I have been able to do using Listp  precodelibraryinline libraryRcppEigen librarymicrobenchmark       Create function which takes list into Rcpp and does all manipulations internally no lapply outside A2 lt lapply12, functiont matrixrnorm10  t, nrow  t, ncol  10 B2 lt lapply12, functiont rnormt   This becomes slower relative to R as the size increases.

To overcome this, I thought of trying to use the standard template library vector format.

I am more than willing to make any changes necessary to make this example more reproducible and also to make what I want to do more clear. I know that you all are very busy, and I do not want to waste your time.p  pAt Dirks suggestion, I tried passing a List, then defining a ListOf, which should be faster given the explicit nature of the objects within please correct me if this is wrongp  pHeres what the snippet then looked likep  precodeListMat1 lt using EigenMatrixXd typedef EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt MapMatd ListOfltMapMatdgt AasltListOfltMapMatdgt gtAA return wrapA codepre  pThis passed on my machine by callingp  precodeListMat lt cxxfunctionsignatureAA  List, ListMat1, plugin  RcppEigen res lt ListMatA2 codepre  pHowever, it seems to still be problematic to access elements within this ListOf.
