Positive 247 pI have been searching on here for several days and have come close to what I was hoping existed although not exactly. p  pI have a GUI that has a TabbedPane section containing several tabs that in turn have several JSpinners. The tabs are identical in structure and the spinners are named using the following naming convention [prefix]Spinner][num] ex. Tab 1  redSpinner1, blueSpinner1.. Tab 2 redSpinner2, blueSpinner2.. and so on. I need to extract the values of the spinners on each tab and wanted to do it by building the variable name via concatenation of the prefix, Spinner and the incremented value that is the tab number that the spinner is located on. My goal is to not have to hard code the variable names yet still be able to access the variable methods, specifically getValue.p  pIn my research I have come across two possible solutionsp  p1 Using a Map structure to map the variable name to the actual instancep  p2 Reflection APIp  pThe first method I can use my method of variable name concatenation for the key but will still have to manual map the instance variable name.

I have created a sort of recycle bin feature, that allows users to delete data on the database, but really it just hides it.

But when i unset the property, i am using my own SQL statements.

Negative 247 pHow are code reviews performed on your development teamp  pIve been a developer for several years now in several different companies and I have noticed that there isnt a consistent approach to performing code reviews.p  pAt my current company, code reviews are nonexistent, which has led to a significant decrease in the quality of the code. At previous jobs, code reviews ranged from just making sure coding standards were enforced to Nazilike line by line reviews that took days to complete.p  pSo Im wondering what its like for everyone else out there. And in particular, what tools do you use to perform the reviews And do you find that code reviews help rather than add to the length of time needed for a given projectp  pIm all for code reviews as I believe they are an effective way of spotting problems early in the development cycle and they can help novice programmers become good programmers, good programmers become great programmers, great programmers become excellent programmers and so on and so forth.p  pUp until now, Ive only seen code reviews done manually via comments in Word and Excel documents....but just recently, I saw an ad on this site for a product called a hrefhttpsmartbear.comcodecollab.phpCode Collaboratora and it appears to be a much better way to do code reviews.... One nice feature I noticed is that it can force code reviews to be performed before code can be committed...p  pHas anyone on here ever used this product or a similar one And if so, have you found it makes the process of doing code reviews easierp

But I run into a problem if Im using other peoples code in that I dont necessarily know what changes its making to the environement and therefor my data structure would be out of sync.

Negative 247 pour legacy application uses JDBC 3.0. it supports transactions by implementing its own transaction manager that is capable of returning the same JDBC connection for each thread. The problem I recently discovered is that it doesnt support nested transactions if a transaction is started inside an another transaction, then every SQLs running in the context of the inner transaction will be executed using the same db connection, and when its commited or rolled back it will automatically commit or roll back all the changes starting from the outer transaction.p  pAs far as I understand I can implement the support for nested transaction using JDBC 3.0 savepoints whenever a nested transaction is started, I can set a new savepoint for the current connection. Afterward, if the nested transaction is rolled back, I will just rollback to this savepoint. If, on the other hand, it is commited, I will just do nothing. Only the commit of the most outer transaction will save the changes to the db.p  pIs this correct Does this approach have any flaws If yes, what are my possibilitiesp  pThanks.p

And even if the user elevates during installation, administrative rights are still required for an upgrade using the automated AIR upgrade system since an upgrade is essentially, behind the scenes, an uninstallation of a code.msicode package followed by an installation of another code.msicode package. p  pstrongIs there any way around thisstrong p  pWhat Ive tried so far isp  ul liUsing the Group Policy editor, setting Windows Installer to elevate during installations. Doesnt work, since AIR attempts a for all users installation.li liSpecifying My Documents as the installation directory. Doesnt work, since AIR attempts a for all users installation.li liGiving the user Modify access to the Program Files folder where the application would usually reside. Doesnt work, since this isnt a file permissions issue.li liMaking the user a Power User. Doesnt work, since AIR attempts a for all users installation.li ul  pIm emguessingem that both installing and upgrading would work fine for a user if p  ul lithe AIR installer would attempt to make an only for me application installation instead of a for all users installation, andli lithe user was a Power User, and possiblyli lithe application was installed to My Documentsli ul  pIm also guessing that this problem doesnt exist on OSX and Linux, since they have more intuitive concepts for peruser application installations.p

Negative 247 pIm recording a mono audio stream using a PIC at 8bit 8Khz and streaming it raw to another microprocessor that houses a web server.

Negative 247 pWhen working with activerecord I notice that while constructing associations, the reciprocal association is provided automatically only if the reciprocal model has already been saved.

Negative 247 pIm wondering if it is at all possible to create a Jquery animation with an image that is linkable. Ive looked around but so far Ive had no such luck finding something I could fiddle with the coding to get the desired effect Im looking for, or a plugin.p  pBasically what I want to do is have tabs on the left side of a layout I am currently designing that will pull out when you hover your mouse over them and link to the a page. Currently, I have designed these tabs graphically as part of the layout design, though if coding blocks to rest right where the border of the layout is would be more doable, I am willing to do that.p  pTo be more specific on the animation I am trying to achieve, I want to animate it so it seems as if you are pulling the tab out when you hover your mouse over it, while the other tabs stay stationary. Then, when you move your cursor to say, the tab below it Or another tab, the pulled out tab will move back to its original size and the new tab pulls out like the first one. Id really like to have the animation move the original tab back in while the new tab pulls out, but I am fine with only the tab pull out animation, and the original tab just snapping back to its original state. I know there is coding and functions just for image swapping, but again I have been unable to find any functions, coding, or plugins to do this kind of animation that is clickablelinkable with an image.p  pAnything at all, even a this kind of thing is not doable would be appreciated. Im looking to find out if its possible and how I would achieve it, whether it be what plugins could do it, functions, coding, tutorials that are similar, or other forms of website codingprogramming that could achieve this. Again, if its not doable with images, Id be fine with ways to do this with block links.p  pIm pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS, but Jquery is a fairly new area Im still learning in.p

Negative 247 pI have an slightly unusual security requirement, and Im looking for advice on best practice, or atleast nonbrittle approaches.p  pScenario Intranet system. Data about a number of related entities is to be considered as private. This is known as the unpublished part of the system. Only certain users can access this data. At some stage the users make a selection from this data, mark some records and publish them to the published side. The data published to the published side is removed from the unpublished side. The bulk of the systems users can then work on the records in the published side.p  pI know this sounds like a bool field on a parent record, flagging as published or unpublished, but let me explain how the system we are replacing tackles the issue  this is the level of security we need to emulate. It is a flat file database Dataflex with the unpublished and published data in separate tables, on separate server drives, backed up to separate tapes, in different rooms, with physical access by different people. Network rights ensure that the published users cannot get at the unpublished data. The software also manages rights, but if that goes wrong, or a programmer makes a mistake, they still cant access the wrong data. Sys admins who could potentially broach this data have positive vetted security clearance.p  pSo what I am looking for is advice on how to achieve an architecture with MVC, EF4, SQL that achieves this. At one extreme I build two systems with two sql databases, different rights potentially with the differences contained within web.config so its actually the same codebase. At the other end of the scale its the flag in the table with controller methods marked up to deny access. Thats no good because if a programmer messes up say a search query and it returns data from the wrong category, and it makes it out of the building unnoticed, its likely to result in human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteriap  pSorry for the lengthy description. Best practices or other advice on how to access this sought.p

I am working on the Windows operating system.p  pPresently, I am using TURBO C compiler that does not support direct methods for creating buttons. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 247 pI am tracking objects for which I need to test if they are located inside or outside a cube  bounding box. If they are outside, I do a rayplane intersection to calculate a point on one of the planes of the cube. The ray starts at the center of the box, and points towards the object. The plane is one of the 6 which make up the cube.p  pWhat I would like to avoid is that I am testing the rayplane intersection on every one of the 6 planes all the time. So I thought Id be clever and calculate first the dot product between each of the plane normals and the ray. Then select the one which has the smallest angle closest to 1.p  pThis works only halfway. There are locations when the object is aligned with one of the planes, where my function selects the wrong plane. Most of the time it works though, and I wonder why that is. I figure there must be something fundamentally wrong with my approach.p  pHere are my defined planes, which each have a label. The 0,0,0 of the coordinate system is one corner of the cube.p  precodeplanes       xnear   normal  1, 0, 0, d  0 ,     xfar   normal  1, 0, 0, d  cubeSize.x ,     ynear   normal  0, 1, 0, d  0 ,     yfar   normal  0, 1, 0, d  cubeSize.y ,     znear   normal  0, 0, 1, d  0 ,     zfar   normal  0, 0, 1, d  cubeSize.z ,   codepre  pThen I use the following functionp  precode Determine what plane to use for collision testing. The angle is calculated  between the plane normal and the direction of the ray function whatPlanepos local direction  vec3.subcubeCenter, pos local result local max  1 for label, plane in pairsplanes do     local dotproduct  vec3.dotplane.normal, direction     if dotproduct gt max then         max  dotproduct         result  label     end end return result end codepre  pWhat Im I missing herep  pI guess I could just do the collision test on every plane and then choose the point which is closest to the center of the cube, but that seems like a waste.p

Negative 247 pIve got bit of script that creates a table on a MySQL master, fills it with data, does some work on the data and then drops the table again. p  pI dont want all this to be replicated to the slaves, as it is a waste of time.

Negative 247 pemWhat do I have to do to implement my own stream, strongwhich uses custom compression routinestrong, similiar to, for example, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarysystem.io.compression.gzipstream.aspx relnofollowcodeGZipStreamcodeaemp  pI obviously have to subclass the codeStreamcode class, but which methods should be implemented by me and which methods can be left with their default implementationsp  pBasically speaking, there is a special part of documentation, strongbut maybe there is a better and easier optionstrongp  blockquote   pNotes to Implementersp      pWhen implementing a derived class of Stream, you   must provide implementations for the Read and Write methods. The   asynchronous methods BeginRead, EndRead, BeginWrite, and EndWrite are   implemented through the synchronous methods Read and Write. Similarly,   your implementations of Read and Write will work correctly with the   asynchronous methods. The default implementations of ReadByte and   WriteByte create a new singleelement byte array, and then call your   implementations of Read and Write. When deriving from Stream, if you   have an internal byte buffer, it is strongly recommended that you   override these methods to access your internal buffer for   substantially better performance. You must also provide   implementations of CanRead, CanSeek, CanWrite, Flush, Length,   Position, Seek, and SetLength.p      pDo not override the Close method, instead, put all of the Stream   cleanup logic in the Dispose method. For more information, see   Implementing a Dispose Method.p blockquote

Negative 247 pIn my application what happens is that the user chooses a button by clicking on the open Grid link and selecting a button. Then what happens is that a set of buttons appear below depending on what the user has chosen. The user is supose to determine how many answers he wants to select in the text box in other words how many buttons does the user want to select. For example if the user enters 2 in the textbox, then the user can only select 2 buttons below. The problem is that if the user types in a number in the text box, then it would not allow the user to select a button, a button is selected if the color of the button turns green. but if I remove the number which is in the text box, then if I click on a button it comes up with an alert message stating that you should determine the number of answers you want, this is correct.p  pSo why is it not allowing me to select any buttons if there is a number inside the Number of Answers textboxp  pCode is in jsfiddle, click a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpSy9712 relnofollowhereap  pThank Youp

Here is my source, its pretty straight forwardp  precodevoid BoardaddFields      forint i  0 iltsize i the boards size is size x size              forint j  0 jltsize j                      Field  f  new Field             fields.pushbackf             qDebugltltisizejltlt ltltf                   qDebugltltfields.size  codepre  pAnd after i got a ton of weird errors, i decided to write to the console the actual number of elements, the reference of the actual element, and after the two loop the size of the vector. p  pThe result was pretty strange, i got no errors, but somtimes it added all my elements, sometimes it stopped at a random number of elements, and the size of the vector doesnt even got printed out like thisp  presult 1 normalp  p0   0xa173a8p  p...p  p24   0x701c18p  p25p  presult 2  every time with a different number of elementsp  p0   0xa173a8p  p...p  p12   0xa17548 p  pand no vector size, i assume the function got a return because of somethingp  pI tried it with both QVector, and stdvector, its the same.

It may certainly useful for other developers but its not a specific code question.p  pIn Google Chrome is there a way to look at render engine exceptions or general debugging info I have some code which im 99 certain is crashing the renderrepaint engine for chrome but im on a mac in the Console.app I dont get notifications for the exception. Im wondering if theres a way of forcing chrome to be much more verbose in its logging Perhaps its a webkit thing rather than chrome specific.p  pLet me know if this really isnt for stack overflow and Ill removeclose the question like I said Im aware its not code specific.p

Negative 247 pMy understanding of touch handling is that when a view is touched, if it itself doesnt handle touches, it hands the touches up the view hierarchy until they are either handled, or youre at the top and theyre discarded.  In essence, its recursion it hands the touches up to their subview, at which point the same upward direction functions are called to pass it upward.p  pIm in an odd situation where a UIScrollView  which SHOULD intercept and handle any and all touches from its children  appears to be intercepting the touches of a UIImageView placed on top of it.  Remove the scroll view, and touches work properly.  The problem is, the UIImageView in question is NOT a child of the UIScrollView its a sibling.p  pSo my question becomes twofold  first, how do I stop it from stealing these touches, and two, how can it be stealing them in the first placep

Negative 247 pIm trying to render a filtered collection from a single view using a select box using the reset property. First issue is that the select box and the rendered content must all appear in the same div in order to work. Is this normal Second issue, is that instead showing the filtered results only, it appends the filtered collection to the end of the rendered content instead of replacing it.I know append in my .each function wont work because it will only append the filtered items to the end of the entire collection.

Negative 247 pI build some validation service. p  precodeprivate static void Mainstring[] args                  var service  new ValidationManager     service.Start      System.Console.ReadLine      service.Stop  codepre  pcodeValidationManagercode using codeThreadPoolcode to execute codeValidatecode method that receives input to check. To simplify the problem  codeValidatecode method just do some regex checking. After thread finishes validation it should save the result to DB. Without DB saving the service does 60,000 validations within 10 seconds. With DB saving it does about 5,000 validaitons. To improve the performance I use some codeBulkManagercode that receives the validation results from threads and saves the results to DB by bulks. codeBulkManagercode uses itself codeThreadPoolcode to save the bulks to DB. This did improved. Now codeValidationManagercode does about 11,000 validations.p  pI thought that if I could decouple codeBulkManagercode from codeValidationManagercode to different strongprocessstrong it would improve more. So, I created console WCF service with codenetNamedPipeBindingcode in the same solution. p  precode[ServiceContract] public interface ISqlBulkWCFService      [OperationContract]     void SaveLogstring email, string summary     [OperationContract]     void SaveFinalResultstring email, byte resultType, string summary       public class SqlBulkWCFService ISqlBulkWCFService      public void SaveLogstring email, string summary               public void SaveFinalResultstring email, byte resultType, string summary            codepre  pI added webservice reference to codeValidationManagercode project and instead to do codesqlManager.SaveLog...code I do codesqlBulkWCFServiceClient.SaveLog...code. But, now codeValidationManagercode does strongONLY 100 validationsstrong. p  pI though it will be faster, because one process does validation and the other saving to DB. And I thought the communication with WCF service will be fast because the client and server in the same machine. Where is my mistakep

They use structs, no classes, and have a static method for deleting the list, which you need to explicitly remember to call.

Negative 247 pI have a need for a pattern interpretation and rule generating system. Basically how it will work is that it should parse through text and interpret patterns from it, and based on those interprtation, i need to output a set of rules. Here is an example. Lets say i have an HTTP header which looks likep  precodeGET httpswebsite.comapi1.0download8hqcdzt9oaq8llapjai1bpp2q27p14ah2139379149 HTTP1.1 Host website.com UserAgent net.me.me2.7.1OSiOS5.0.1AppleiPad 2 GSM Accept  AcceptLanguage enus AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate codepre  pThe parser would run through this and outputp  precodereqhdrpattern GET[ ].api1.0downloadSTRINGauthtokenSTRINGid[].website.com codepre  pThe above rule contains a modified version of regex. Each variable e.g STRINGauthtoken or STRINGid is to be extracted.p  pFor parsing through the textheader in this case i will have to tell the parser that it needs to extract whatever comes after the download. So basically there is a definition of a set of rules which this parser will use to parse through the text and eventually output the final rule.p  pNow the question is, is there any such module available in python for pattern matching,detection,generation that can help me with this This is somewhat like a compilers parser part. I wanted to ask before going deep into trying to make one myself. Any help p

Negative 247 pI have 2 models, Albums and Pictures and a function codealbumreordercode which receives a list of picture IDs and alters the weights accordingly. This works fine, however Im trying to write tests for the function, such asp  precodeClass ReposTestsunittest.TestCase     def testalbumreorderfailnotownedself           Create a test user, album and pictures.         user  self.createtestuser          createdefaultalbum generates an Album along with 6 default Picture records.             createdefaultalbumuser         album  getfirstalbumuser.profile         pictures  Picture.objects.filteralbumalbum           Get all picture IDs into a list and record each pictures existing weight.         pictureids  []         pictureweights           for picture in pictures             pictureids.appendpicture.id             print sss  album.id, picture.id, picture.weight             pictureweights[picture.id]  picture.weight           Create another test user, album and pictures.         user2  self.createtestuser         createdefaultalbumuser2         album2  getfirstalbumuser2.profile         pictures2  Picture.objects.filteralbumalbum2           Add a Picture ID from a different user to test the restriction that an album cannot be reordered if any pictures do not belong to the specified user.         pictureids.appendpictures2[0].id         print sss  album2.id, pictures2[0].id, pictures2[0].weight         pictureweights[pictures[2].id]  pictures2[0].weight           Shuffle all picture IDs         random  Random         while pictures[0].id  pictureids[0]             random.shufflepictureids           Reorder picture IDs according to shuffled ID list, however this should fail due to the ownership check.         albumreorderuser, pictureids         print pictureids         print pictureweights           Check each         for pictureid in pictureids             self.assertEqualpictureweights[pictureid], Picture.objects.getidpictureid.weight codepre  pNow the problem seems to be in the way the codepictureweightscode dict is constructed. Since the following two lines outputp  precode Loop output album.id, picture.id, picture.weight  134656990  134657001  134657012  134657023  134657034  134657045  134757050  print pictureids  Outputs [5700L, 5703L, 5702L, 5699L, 5704L, 5705L, 5701L]  print pictureweights  Outputs 5699L 0L, 5700L 1L, 5701L 0L, 5702L 3L, 5703L 4L, 5704L 5L codepre  pNote that codepictureidscode is 7 elements long, as expected, where as codepictureweightscode is only  6 elements, and the weights do not match those as output from the loop. The second user picture code5705code is missing from codepictureweightscode however one of the codepictureweightscode has been assigned the incorrect weight of code0Lcode.p  pIm not experienced with dicts at all however, Im just trying to apply my knowledge of PHP Associative arrays so Im assuming I have a gap in my knowledge there.

Negative 247 pI had explored for a PDF Reader in iOS. I found out 2 useful libraries, Leaves PDF Reader and VFR  PDF Reader from Github. But  am having issues with these two libraries.p  pIn the case of Leaves PDF Reader, I had integrated it with my application. If I did pinch zooming, the page will be zooming. But the texts in the pages will be blurred and could read it out. p  pIn the case of PDF Reader from Github, its a fully functional library. I like this reader most when compared to Leaves PDF Reader. But this library will render the PDFs perfectly if the PDF is taken from the bundle folder of the application. In my case, I wanted to integrate this with a newsstand application. So the downloading PDFs are stored in a cache library which is predefined for Newsstand applications library folder. If I gave this path as input to the PDF Reader library, the application got crashed. So I copied the PDF file from the newsstand library path to a NSDocument directory folder. Still the issue is same. This library render the PDF only if the PDFs are kept in the Bundle folder.p  pCan anybody help me in any of the above case.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 247 pLets say I have multiple running Activities A, B, and C. Each share a similar optionsmenu with some differences in their execution start option might be slightly different in Activity A than B. I also have a static class called values that is tied to activity A. It also has the context of the current running activity. p  pAt times values may call an item in the optionsmenu of the current running activity. My code is messysee below so I would like to organize it to a more readable form.p  pMy goal is to set up values so that it can call just a function of the current running activity instead of an optionmenu item of that activity. Inside the activity an item of the optionsmenu would just call a function instead of code inside of it for organization reasons. p  pHere a sample of values.class calling the item of an optionsmenu of the current running activity.  p  precodepublic void startExample          Runnable startRun  new Runnable              Override             public void run                   handler.postnew Runnable   This thread runs in the                                                  UI                     Override                     public void run                          Activity getCurrentContext.openOptionsMenu                         Activity getCurrentContext.closeOptionsMenu                         Activity getCurrentContext.onOptionsItemSelectedtheMenu.findItemR.id.start                                                                     new ThreadstartRun.start  codepre  pAs you can see values.startExample calles the start item of the options menu of the current running activity. I would like to change this so that it calls a function based off of the current running activity instead. So I was thinking that I could do something like this instead.p  pIn values.classp  precodeActivityB b  new ActivityB public void startExample      Runnable startRun  new Runnable          Override         public void run               handler.postnew Runnable   This thread runs in the                                              UI                    Override                 public void run                      if Activity getCurrentContext.getClass.getName.equalspackage.ActivityB                        b.start                                                                      new ThreadstartRun.start  codepre  pAnd Activity B might look like.p  precodepublic class ActivityB extends Activity  class code here  Override  public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item          switchitem.getItemId                 case start                     this.start                     break                 public void start         code here     codepre  pIs this possible I know that this question might sound confusing so please ask questions and I might be able to simplify it again.p

Negative 247 pUsing Symfony2 and FOSUserBundle, I am not getting the expected behavior on the following implementation.p  pTo begin, know that codeContinue where I left offcode option in Chrome restores completely the user session independently of having checked some Remember me or something like that. Therefor,it saves a cookie with all the information of the session.p  pWhat I am trying to do is to avoid the creation of a session from the cookie stored through that codeContinue where I left offcode option on Chrome.p  pOr, if I cannot avoid the creation of the session, at least try to know that the session comes from that completely transparent way.p  pI have found this in Symfony2 documentation specifically a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoc2.0cookbooksecurityrememberme.html relnofollowhereap  blockquote   pIn some cases, however, you may want to force the user to actually reauthenticate before accessing certain resources. For example, you might allow remember me users to see basic account information, but then require them to actually reauthenticate before modifying that information.   The security component provides an easy way to do this. In addition to roles explicitly assigned to them, users are automatically given one of the following roles depending on how they are authenticated   ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY  automatically assigned to a user who is in a firewall protected part of the site but who has not actually logged in. This is only possible if anonymous access has been allowed.   ISAUTHENTICATEDREMEMBERED  automatically assigned to a user who was authenticated via a remember me cookie.   ISAUTHENTICATEDFULLY  automatically assigned to a user that has provided their login details during the current session.p blockquote  pSo, if I dont get it wrong, a user that transparently logs in as a result of the codeCopntinue where I left offcode option, should have the ISAUTHENTICATEDREMEMBERED.p  pWell, the reality is that it is not thus. The reality is that the granting is ISAUTHENTICATEDFULLY.p  pHas anyone passed through thisp  pAny idea on all thisp  pThanksp

Negative 247 pAfter backing up my Wordpress installation MySQL databases via phpMyAdmin, and the entire front end website via FTP I updated a handful of plugins, which resulted in an important aspect of the website to fail.p  pThe plugin I believe is responsible is Advanced Custom Fields, updated from 2.0.5 to 3.5.8.1. When I updated this plugin I got the notificationp  pAdvanced Custom Fields v3.5.8.1 requires a database upgrade why. Please backup your database, then click Upgrade Database. This was completed successfully.p  pAs Ive been unable to solve the problem Im looking to restore my Wordpress installation from the backup. My question is what will be required to do this Do I need to restore files from the FTP backup as well as the various mySQL databasesp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 247 pIm trying to get around the limitation of YC and MP being mutually exclusive. Id like to leverage precompiled headers AND multiprocess compilation.p  pMy answer so far has been to create 2 projects instead of 1. The first is a pch generating library consisting of just an stdafx.h and stdafx.cpp. It generates the pch file with YC set on the stdafx.cppp  pThat library generates the pch file successfully As a side note, the pch library project also has YU specified pointing to its stdafx.h and Fp referencing the output pch file.p  pMy second project is my main executable. It has MP specified but does not have YC specified for any file and does not contain an stdafx.h or stdafx.cpp. Instead I set the projects YU to the stdafx.h of the pch library and Fp to the pch generated by the pch library. I then set the pch library as a dependency of the exe project. I also set FI on the exe project to forcibly include the stdafx.h from the pch library in each compilation unit.p  pMy problem is that, while the pch library DOES generate the pch file and the exe project does seem to reference the generated pch file correctly, as soon as the exe project starts to build after some prebuild steps unrelated to the pch, it DELETES the pch generated by the pch library. I imagine its because it thinks, with Fp is specified, that the project will generate that file even though there are no YCs specified.p  pIs there something Im doing wrong here Am I missing a step. Is there a way to prevent the exe project from deleting my pch file before it starts buildingp  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 247 pI have links in a JQuery DataTable that use JQuery UIs tooltip feature. Each link has a tooltip that is populated by an Ajax call. I would like to limit the number of Ajax calls to as few as possible. The DataTable uses serverside processing, and the results are paginated, so there will never be more than ten links on the page at any one time.p  pThe data that is returned by the Ajax call will never change and thus can be safely cached. In my testing, I have seen that the browser does cache the result of each Ajax call, so that it only makes one call per link, and then uses the cache thereafter. My concern is that some user might have their browser configured in such a way that it doesnt use the cache for some reason, and they will be firing off one Ajax call after another, every time they mouse over a link. p  pHere is the JavaScript for the tooltipp  precode.jobId.tooltip     content functioncallback          var jobId  this.text          .ajax             url myUrl,             data jobId jobId,             dataType json,             success functiondata                  var html  formatResultsdata                 callbackhtml             ,             error function                  callbackAn error has occurred.                             codepre  pI considered storing the result of each Ajax call in a JavaScript object declared at global scope, and then checking that before making the Ajax call, but I have the vague sense that this might cause a memory leak somehow.p  precodevar gJobs  new Object  .jobId.tooltip     content functioncallback          var jobId  this.text          if gJobs[jobId]              callbackgJobs[jobId]          else              .ajax                 url myUrl,                 data jobId jobId,                 dataType json,                 success functiondata                      var html  formatResultsdata                     gJobs[jobId]  html                     callbackhtml                 ,                 error function                      callbackAn error has occurred.                                              codepre  pI am also concerned that if the table has a large number of rows, the gJobs object could end up using a lot of memory. To prevent the gJobs object from growing indefinitely, every time the user goes to the next or previous page of results in the DataTable, I use the fnDrawCallback function to reinitialize gJobsp  precodejobsTable.dataTable ...     fnDrawCallback function          gJobs  new Object       codepre  pI should mention that since the data returned by each Ajax call doesnt change, I could also just store the data in the JSP as static text, and populate the tooltips that way instead of using Ajax. However, I have to make a separate web service call to get the data for each link, and rather than make ten web service calls every time the user pages forward or back, I would rather load the data on demand via Ajax.p  pIs there anything wrong with this approach Is there any way this can cause a memory leak Should I explicitly delete all the properties of gJobs before reinitializing it Thanks for your help.p

Negative 247 pNowadays, iOS support an extension named GLEXTcolorbufferhalffloat, and it can let the half float format accepted by the  parameter of glRenderbufferStorage.p  pBut, in iOS, renderbuffer should be connected to CAEAGLLayer of the view like thisp  precode BOOL renderbufferStorageNSUIntegertarget fromDrawableiddrawable codepre  pand only one renderbuffer can be created for one framebuffer. So, I think I should create another framebuffer to attach a new renderbuffer, and specify the internal format of it for half float. Am I rightp  pAnother question, there is another extension OEStexturehalffloat can be used by glTexImage2D, and we already can create half float texture attached to framebuffer directly. It seems that we have no need to render a half float renderbuffer attached to framebuffer. so what is the use scenario of GLEXTcolorbufferhalffloatp
Negative 247 pI ported a volume renderer from c using glm and glut to LWJGL, java. The volume renderer uses a shader with a 3d texture.  For some reason though the fps sticks at 35 fps. I tried trimming the shader, but it doesnt have any affect on the fps.p  pProfiler output img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0yhw7.png altenter image description herep  pJava class a hrefhttppastebin.comK61mcWzL relnofollowhttppastebin.comK61mcWzLap  pCould it be that the limiting factor are the calls to the 3D volume which is probably stored in global memory because of the significant size This would be odd, because I decreased the number of calls to the volume significantly and that should then result in a higher fps, which it doesnt.p  pEdit Also, the Netbeans profiler doesnt give the time per frame, but instead displays the summed time. It does give the number of samples, but dividing the Time by Samples gives me about 10 fps according to my calculations i.e. display has 16 samples below. How do I get the accurate time per frame of the Netbeans profiler Relevant to this questionp

Negative 247 pBasically what Im trying to do is a system that each time there is a new user added to a SQL Server database, it sends a notification to the android and iOS app Im developing. I was planning to use the Goocle Cloud Messaging, but the notifications need to get to the iOS application as well.

Negative 247 pI am working on a project and one part of it is a form through which an admin can create many subadmins. On this form there are four checkboxes which are checked by admin to set different permissions for the subadmin. However this form is editable means when the admin wants to edit some info of a subadmin similar kind of form opens with values filled in respective fields which are fetched from database. So the admin fills in info like Name, Email, Password, Permissions 4 check boxesp  pLater if admin wants to edit the subadmin info he selects that subadmin from a list of subadmins and the same form opens with same fields but values in fields filled which is from db. So it is like Name ABC, Email abcdef.com, Password 1234, Permissions 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 checkboxes checkedp  pNow what I want is when admin clicks update button that subadmins info gets updated along with checkboxes. So while updating info the admin can remove or give new permissions to the subadmin. For example if previously subadmin had only three permissions then on updation admin can give or remove permissions and that subadmin can have 1 or 2 or 4 permissions given to him from 3 previously by the admin. I have written code for this but what is happening is on updation three new rows are created in the database table. So if that subadmin has 1,2,3 permission associated with him in the table then on updation 1,2,3 are created again and again on eah successive updation. Here is my logic for this 1. Get all permissions from db table and permissions coming in via form. 2. If permissions from form equals permissions from db table, do nothing. 3. If permissions from db table is not equal to permissions from form then delete db table permissions which are not in form permissions. 4. If permissions from form is not equal to permissions from database table then add permissions which are coming from form to db table. and my code for this is belowp  precodesubadminpermission  POST[subadminpermission]    permissions from form collected as an array queryselect  SELECT permissionname FROM ftvsubadminspermissions WHERE subadminidsubadminid resultselect  mysqlqueryqueryselect allpermissions[allpermissions]  array whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresultselect      allpermissions[allpermissions][]  row[permissionname]     permissions from database collected as an array       ifemptysubadminpermission               else              query  UPDATE ftvsubadminslogininfo SET subadminnamesubadminname, subadminmobilesubadminmobile, .                  subadminemailsubadminemail, subadminaddresssubadminaddress, subadmincitysubadmincity, .                  subadminstatesubadminstate, subadmincountrysubadmincountry WHERE subadminidsubadminid         result  mysqlqueryquery          ifresult                      foreachallpermissions[allpermissions] as value                              ifinarrayvalue, subadminpermission                                                   ifinarrayvalue, subadminpermission  TRUE                                      foreachallpermissions[allpermissions] as value                                              querypermissiondelete  DELETE FROM ftvsubadminspermissions WHERE permissionnamevalue AND subadminidsubadminid                         resultpermissiondelete  mysqlqueryquerypermissiondelete                          ifresultpermissionadd                                                      msg  ltspan stylecolorgreen fontweightboldgtSubadmin details has been updatedltspangt                                                  else                                                      msg  ltspan stylecolorred fontweightboldgtSubadmin details could not be updatedltspangt                                                                                          foreachsubadminpermission as value                              ifinarrayvalue, allpermissions[allpermissions]  TRUE                                      foreachsubadminpermission as value                                              querypermissionadd  INSERT INTO ftvsubadminspermissionssubadminid, permissionname, permissionvalue, permissioncreationdate .

Negative 247 pI fear this is a rather simple question, but after much googling I think I have overshot my intended result. I believe my question to be related to a design pattern, but alas I could be wrong. p  pMy application calls an RESTful API and gets back what amounts to a list of model objects represented by an codeNSDictionarycode. Each of which I will call codeNNEntitycode. There are conceptually multiple different subtypes of NNEntity. All subtypes of codeNNEntitycode share the property of codeentityIDcode, but each have their own unique properties as well. All instances of codeNNEntitycode have a method called codereadFromDictNSDictionary dcode that populates their respective properties. This method is enforced by a protocol that all codeNNEntitycode subtypes conform to. It looks like thisp  precodeNNEntity.h  interface NNEntity  NSObject ltNNReadFromDictProtocolgt  property nonatomic, strong NSString entityID  end  NNEntity.m  implementation NNEntity   voidreadFromDictNSDictionary d      set common properties from values in d     self.entityID  [d objectForKeyID]  end  NNSubEntity1.h  interface NNSubEntity1  NSEntity ltNNReadFromDictProtocolgt  property nonatomic, strong NSString favoriteColor  end  NNSubEntity1.m  implementation NNSubEntity1   voidreadFromDictNSDictionary d      [super readFromDictd]     set unique properties from values in d     self.favoriteColor  [d objectForKeycolorPreference]  end  NNSubEntity2.h  interface NNSubEntity2  NSEntity ltNNReadFromDictProtocolgt  property nonatomic, strong NSString middleName  end  NNSubEntity2.m  implementation NNSubEntity2   voidreadFromDictNSDictionary d      [super readFromDictd]     set unique properties from values in d     self.middleName  [d objectForKeymiddleName]  end codepre  pI have read various pieces on the use of a Factory or Builder Desing pattern for similar use cases but I am curious if that is necessary in this rather simple case. For example, does my current code end up creating both and instance of codeNNEntitycode and codeNNSubEntity2code if I were to call something like thisp  precodeNNEntity newEntity  [[NNSubEntity2 alloc] init] assume dict exists already and is properly keyed [newEntity readFromDictdict] codepre  pI assume not, but would codenewEntitycode have both the common property of codeentityIDcode as well as the unique property of codemiddleNamecode set correctly Also, much appreciated if you have thoughts on a better or more efficient design approach. p

Negative 247 pI am working on an android app and I am creating a database called HealthDev.db that has a table called rawData that has 4 columns  id, foreignUserId, data, timeStampp  pI have worked with the program sqlite3 in the bash shell and have figured out that I can have a time stamp column with the following column schema parameter  timeStamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENTTIMESTAMPp  pso when I created the table I used create table rawDataid integer primary key autoincrement, foreignUserId integer, data real, timeStamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENTTIMESTAMPp  pThis worked fine in the bash.p  pThen I practiced in the sqlite3 and know that when inserting into the timeStamp column and using the function timenow as a value to store it actually stores a time stamp in the form HHMMSS in Universal Coordinated Time.p  pSo now translating that into java for the android app, I used the following code below. This way the table automatically generates about 20 rows when the onCreate is called. This is just for testing if I am passing the timenow correctly in java.p  precode         Below are variables to the database table name and the   database column names. public static final String TABLERAWDATA  rawData public static final String COLUMNID  id public static final String COLUMNFOREIGNUSERID  foreignUserId public static final String COLUMNDATA  data     public static final String COLUMNTIMESTAMP  timeStamp   Database creation sql statement. private static final String DATABASECREATE  create table       TABLERAWDATA              COLUMNID   integer primary key autoincrement,        COLUMNFOREIGNUSERID   integer,        COLUMNDATA   real,        COLUMNTIMESTAMP   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENTTIMESTAMP         initializes the columns of the database given by passing the DATABASECREATE  sql statement to the incoming database. public static void onCreateSQLiteDatabase database      database.execSQLDATABASECREATE      For testing      ContentValues contentValues  new ContentValues     System.out.printlnThe database is open   database.isOpen     for int i  0 i lt 20 i              contentValues.put COLUMNFOREIGNUSERID, 8976         contentValues.put COLUMNDATA, Math.random100          contentValues.put COLUMNTIMESTAMP,  timenow            database.insert TABLERAWDATA, null, contentValues           contentValues  new ContentValues           codepre  pAfter running this code in an eclipse emulator I then pulled the database file from the file explorer in DDMS view mode for eclipse android projects. Then I opened the database in a bash shell and then selected all the columns from the table rawData to show it on the shell. I noticed that the timenow was treated as a string and not a function. To prove that the timenow function worked I manually inserted a new row using timenow for the timeStamp value. Then re selected all the columns to show them again. It successfully printed the time stampe as HHMMSS.p  pI am thinking there might be a difference in the enviroments The bash shell recognizes the function timenow, which was written in c right, because I have the sqlite3 program in the bash Yet in eclipse when I use a SQL database and use the insert it treats the timenow as a string. Keep in mind I am working in a Windows 7 os. I am accessing the bash as a client SSH Secure Shell from my school which is the host.p  pMy main question is it possible to code it so that way it recognizes the timenow functionp

Negative 247 pI have written an extensive onscreen keyboard OSK in Java. This is intended for people with disabilities and needs to be able to do strongeverythingstrong that a standard keyboard can do. One thing Ive noticed that doesnt work is strongcontext menusstrong  in most Windows programs. I want my OSK user to be able to click the Context Menu key normally beside rightCtrl on standard keyboard and use the arrow keys to navigate that menu. The context menu appears fine, but when I click back onto my Frame to press an arrow key, the context menu disappears. p  pAnybody got any ideas as to how this might be achieved probably a fairly monstrous hack required I would think Im pretty sure the context is disappearing because a mouseclick is occurring elsewhere on the screen hard to get around that when you need to actually click something.p  pBelow is a test app. I can use it to navigate down through a context menu in NetBeans successfully, but not in any other application Ive tried e.g. Windows Explorer.p  precodeimport java.awt.Robot import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.KeyEvent import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.WindowConstants  public class RobotContextMenuTest extends JFrame implements ActionListener      Robot R     JPanel JP     JButton JBmenu, JBdown      public RobotContextMenuTest              try                      R  new Robot                  catchException e                      e.printStackTrace                   JP  new JPanel         getContentPane.addJP          JBmenu  new JButtonMenu         JBmenu.addActionListenerthis         JP.addJBmenu          JBdown  new JButtonDown         JBdown.addActionListenerthis         JP.addJBdown          setFocusableWindowStatefalse         setAlwaysOnToptrue         setSize200,80         setDefaultCloseOperationWindowConstants.EXITONCLOSE         setVisibletrue          public static void mainString args[]              new RobotContextMenuTest           public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              ife.getActionCommand.equalsMenu                      R.keyPressKeyEvent.VKCONTEXTMENU             R.keyReleaseKeyEvent.VKCONTEXTMENU                  else ife.getActionCommand.equalsDown                      R.keyPressKeyEvent.VKDOWN             R.keyReleaseKeyEvent.VKDOWN                codepre  pFinally, heres what Ive triedp  ul liUsing MouseListener on the buttons instead of ActionListener, then consuming the MouseEvent in the hope that the other application wont register it and hide the context menu.li liI made a Threaded test application that is able to show any context menu and automatically scan down through it once every second but that doesnt really solve my problem I want the context menu navigation to be controlled by the users mouse clicks.li liIve tried using JNativeHook as an alternative method of capturing mouse clicks but the result is the same.li ul  pSorry for the longwinded question but its a fairly complicated problem Incidentally, the standard Windows 7 OSK cant do this either but a hrefhttpwww.wivik.com relnofollowWiViKa can.

Negative 247 pIm trying to update an arcane scientific F77 program to the modern world by making it easier to install w a .configure script.  However, this has proved to be more difficult than advertised.  The program Im dragging kicking and screaming into the 21st century requires the SuperMongo plotting library, and Im trying to figure out how to have Automake find the correct path for the necessary SuperMongo libraries libplotsub.a, libdevices.a, and libutils.a Rather than have you kind souls look at the guts of the code, Ive created a skeleton github repository a hrefhttpsgithub.comAcetylene5autoconftesting relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAcetylene5autoconftestinga.p  pThe main program is test.f, and calls the junk.f file.  Both files include the Stuff.com common block.  The file junk.f calls two functions one dcopy is from the LAPACK library, and the other drawcurs is from the SuperMongo program.  The reason I did this is because this program Im fastforwarding out of the stone age uses both these libraries.p  pI found on the interwebs a LAPACK macro axlapack.m4 which seems to find the LAPACK libraries on my system.  Ive attempted to copy this .m4 file to axsupermongo.m4, and change the requisite names and directories.  However, I am not an M4 expert, so I have no idea if this is doing what I want.  I dont think it is, because if you look at the output of .configure, it doesnt seem to find the smgraphics file the token supermongo routine used by axsupermongo.m4 to the location of the SM librariesp  precodedeenaida44170CodeFORTRANtestingautoconfmastergt autoreconf i deenaida44170CodeFORTRANtestingautoconfmastergt .configure configure loading site script usrsharesitex8664unknownlinuxgnu checking for a BSDcompatible install... usrbininstall c checking whether build environment is sane... yes checking for a threadsafe mkdir p... usrbinmkdir p checking for gawk... gawk checking whether make sets MAKE... yes checking whether the Fortran 77 compiler works... yes checking for Fortran 77 compiler default output file name... a.out checking for suffix of executables...  checking whether we are cross compiling... no checking for suffix of object files... o checking whether we are using the GNU Fortran 77 compiler... no checking whether usrlocal2miscirafirafunixhlibf77.sh accepts g... yes checking for style of include used by make...

Negative 247 pI am attempting to create a codeFragmentcode for an Android application where I have either codeButtoncodes or codeImageButtoncodes programatically arranged in a circle, with lines drawn from them to the center of the codeViewcode. However, I have become stumped as to how to do this.p  pFrom my understanding, I can create a custom codeViewcode in which I can override the codeonDrawcode to draw the lines, but I cannot put the codeButtoncodes in this way. I can overlay the custom codeViewcode with a codeFrameLayoutcode or the like, but I do not know what type of layout to use so that the buttons can be arranged in a circle and that this will work for various screen sizes.p  pFurthermore, I have to ensure that both the drawn lines and the buttons will be able to be animated together that is, for instance, the buttons and connecting lines can move offscreen at the same rate as if they were one entity.p  pI have seen this post, and it is actually very similar to what I would like to do  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9368863dynamicallyarrangebuttonsaroundacircleDynamically arrange Buttons around a Circlea . However, I do not quite have a satisfactory understanding of the answer, particularly how a codeButtoncode can be created in an codeonDrawcode with codeonClickcode still functioning.p  pAny suggestions would really be appreciatedp

Negative 247 pI want to know if there is a emsafe programmingem practice that would alert a coder to this subtle behavior when it takes place or, even better, avoid it in the first place.p  pA user of codestruct Acode might not realize there is no move constructor.  In their attempt to call the absent ctor they get neither a compiler warning or any runtime indication that a copy ctor was called instead.p  pAn answer below explains the conversion that takes place but I dont see any rationale for this being a good thing.  If the constructor taking a emconst referenceem as a parameter were missing there would be a compile time error rather than just resolving to the emnonconst referenceem version.  So why wouldnt an attempt at using move semantics result in a compile time error when there is no move semantics implemented in the classp  pIs there a way to avoid this behavior with some compile time option or at least a way to detect it during run time  p  pOne could codeassertsource is nullcode after the move strongifstrong they were anticipating the problem but that is true of so many problems.p  pExample, whenp  precodestruct A      A ...     AA ampa ...     AA const amp A ...  codepre  pis constructed as inp  precodeA a1 A a2  stdmovea1  calls const copy but how would I know codepre  pthis results in the const version of the copy ctor being called. Now two objects might have a pointer to a single resource while one of them is likely to be calling its destructor soon.p

Negative 247 pIs there anyway to change the default JSON serializationdeserialization of DateTime in WCF p  pCurrently, DateTime are serialized into the codeDate13722521626570200code format, which shouldve been fine but Im running into issues when my server is not in UTC which I cant change. p  pAll datetime data that is being processed by this service is in UTC format. Everything works when the server is in UTC. However, the stagingprod environments are set to GMT1Paris and the serializer is assuming that the datestimes are in GMT1, completely ignoring the attribute codeKindcode. So as youd expect calling codeDateTime.SetKindcode and setting it to UTC will not work. In effect, the serialized times are delayed by an hour.p  pI can either do twoway date conversations it also makes the same assumption when deserializing so its always GMT1 conversation of dates UTC tofrom server time, but this is to tedious. So I thought maybe I could just override the default serialization behavior.p
Negative 247 pIm rewriting a script that is used to summarize regression testing results.

This took about 30 minutes on our standard development machines. Then it generated an HTML file that contains a table with links to all nonnull diffs.p  pAs a developer, Ive come to realize that, while they are often useful, most of those diffs are never looked at. One idea I had to speed this process is to compare the files using Python filecmp.cmp tool, and create a table of all of the differences. Then, use Javascript to diff only the links that are clicked on, using the diffmatchpatch tool. These results would be displayed in the browser. I think I understand the API for diffmatchpatch, but  Im stuck trying to load these files into the Javascript environment.p  pIve tried opening these files in an iframe which Id make invisible, but I cannot seem to access the files content once they are open. I realize there are sameorigin rules, but I would be reading the files from the same drive as the html file resides, which I think should be legal. Im not sure if my problem is with my understanding of the DOM, or if this just isnt possible. My knowledge of Javascript is quite minimaloutdated which may be the real problem, but this seems to be a strange use case so Ive had trouble finding any examples. If theres a quirk with browsers, I do have the ability to mandate which browser is used. Heres what I have so far, its just a test to see what Ive got loaded and what Im accessing. In Chrome I get nothing added to the div, and in Firefox I get undefinedp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt   ltscript typetextjavascript languageJavaScriptgt     function changeSrc      var base  document.getElementByIdbase     base.src..resulttest1.txt     var mod  document.getElementByIdmod     mod.src..resulttest2.txt      var result   mod.contentWindow.document.body.innerText     document.getElementByIdresult.innerHTML  ltBRgt  result        ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt   ltiframe idbase srcgtltiframegt   ltiframe idmod srcgtltiframegt   ltbrgt   ltspan onClickchangeSrc stylecursor pointergtloadFilesltspangt   ltbrgt   ltdiv idresultgtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pId appreciate any help making this work, or advice telling me Im wasting my time.

Negative 247 pActivity A is a splash screen. Activity B is a menu screen that is singleTask. Activity C is a screen with noHistory that selects a photograph from the gallery with the builtin intent for choosing a photograph. Activity D is a screen that manipulates photographs.p  pThe problem that I have is that when I am in Activity D and select the home button, if I choose the application to be launched once more it returns me to Activity A to launch Activity B again instead of launching Activity D where I left off.  If I use the recent apps however, it switches back to Activity D just fine as expected.  So, there must be something slightly error prone in the way that I have it setup.

However, Im looking for a solution that doesnt involve extending this class, because I need this solution to also be applicable for the case when its not only one class that I have to persist, but a collection of interlinked classes  none of which has any ID property. In such a scenario, extending doesnt work out.p

Negative 247 pI am implementing an application where I have a bunch of different Entities which I inherit from a base model that is common to all these entities.  Currently Lets say I have EntityParent who is my base class and I have about 5 different Entities inheriting the base class.  Lets say I have EntityA, EntityB, EntityC, EntityD and EntityE respectively and currently I am fetching EntityA from the database and I also would like to fetch other entities just like Belowp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext context  managedObjectContext  NSFetchRequest  fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] NSEntityDescription entityDiscA  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameEntityA inManagedObjectContextcontext] [fetchRequest setEntityentityDiscA]  NSError error  NSArray fetchedAs  [context executeFetchRequestfetchRequest erroramperror]   NSFetchRequest  fetchRequestB  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] NSEntityDescription entityDiscB  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameEntityB inManagedObjectContextcontext] [fetchRequestB setEntityentityDiscB]  NSError error  NSArray fetchedBs  [context executeFetchRequestfetchRequestB erroramperror] codepre  pBut I would like to also fetch EntityBs and EntityCs and so forth, but when I try to fetch my app crashes. If you look at the above code, when I try to fetch the EntityB, I get a SigAbort and crashes. Whats wrong with the code snippet above  Are we not allowed to fetch multiple different Entities using Core Data  Is my only option is to just fetch all the objects based on the parent class and then filter using the class name  I would prefer not to do that, but if thats the only way out, I guess I would have to suck up and work with it.  Would appreciate any suggestions or tips I did read one of the posts where the person suggests to declare the parent class as abstract entity and use it to do fetchesp  pThanks, Rajanp
Negative 247 pIm dealing with a custom authentication authorization scheme with a JSONP web service. Because JSONP doesnt support Windows Authentication, the web service  which does want to authorize against AD  needs to pass the Windows User ID to the client in an encrypted token, so that it can get passed back during requests.p  pThe initial visit to a web page over HTTPS returns a token cookie as a JavaScript fragment in the ASPX page that gets served to the clientp  precodedocument.readyfunction      thetoken  ltbase64encoded encrypted tokengt  codepre  pI know the Windows identity of the user because the Web Application uses Windows Authentication. The cookie consists of codeltWindows UserID, TimeStamp, IPAddress of visitorgtcode.p  pNow the user clicks on an element that needs to execute a web service that requires authorization. The event handler passes on the token back to the web service as part of the query string passed back to my web service, which lives in a separate web application on the IIS server. p  precodetheButton.clickfunction     getJSON        buildurltowebSvcwithargs,thetoken,        null,        svcsuccess.failsvcfail  codepre  pThe web service now receives the call, decrypts the token, validates that the IP address the call came from is the same as the original requesting IP address, and makes sure the token isnt expired. If authorization passes, the web service performs its service and returns a response, complete with a new token, consisting of codeltSame userID that was passed in, new time stamp, IPAddress of visitorgtcode.p  pThe callback function of the jQuery call is now invoked with the new token, and it gets stored away until the next call to the web service. p  precodefunction svcsuccess     thetoken  arguments[0]     update with new token from server  codepre  pThis cycle continues until the token expires or the user closes his window.p  pMy concern is that the token, although encrypted, is plainly visible if the user does View Source. She can then copy the token and hand it to another user who is capable of logging onto the same machine shes on. Until that token times out, it is vulnerable to this abuse. Should I be concerned about this If so, what further steps should I be taking to reduce the risk of breachp
Negative 247 pI understand that this is a discussion topic that has no definite answer, but I would really like some feedback on what to expect when developing NFC APPs for Android, in particular using IsoDep to communicate with DESFire cards using APDU frames.p  ul liCan I expect that the same APDU frames sent to a particular DESFire card responds identically across Android Devices and versionsli liWhat Android versions and devices should I test on as a minimum to be reasonably well coveredli liIs it common with bugs or regressions in the Android drivers or can I expect that these are rooted out a long time agoli liWhat is the earliest version of Android you recommend supporting to avoid too much troubleli ul  pSo far my experience has been surprisingly mixed 3 devices, 3 differences and I would really like to hear from other developers.  For example The same APDU commands that work on a S3 Android 4.1.2 does not work on an S4 Android 4.3 wrong length failure on the 3rd autenticate handshake, everything OK until then. These phones have different NFC chipsets, but I did not expect differences on the abstraction level of APDU frames.p

Negative 247 pA little background. I have an app that has historically used NSUserDefaults to store settings. This has caused me many issues since I am storing critical activation values and NSUserDefaults appears to get wiped out sometimes, but that is another topic. I am going to transition to using CoreData and I want to make sure I am approaching this correctly.p  pIve built an entity called Registry that has an attribute of key and one attribute for each possible data type. The idea is keyvalue pairs similar to how you would use NSUserDefaults to store keyvalue pairs. So my model looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCNg6R.png altModelp  pI created a subclass of NSManagedObjectModel. From what I can tell, it is not necessary to do this and the only advantage it gets you is a little cleaner code.

Negative 247 pI have a game written using the new SpriteKit in iOS7. I have a customised codeSKSpriteNodecode which would fetch and display a Facebook profile picture.

However, if the loading of Facebook profile pic is slow, the user may have already switch to another screen when the picture is loaded. In such case, codeselfcode will actually be removed from the scene hierarchy and no reference will be made to it.p  pWhen I read the block doc, I think the async block will retain codeselfcode and so I presume it will still be valid when the main thread block is called. It turns out from time to time if the pic loading is really slow and the second dispatchasync is called when self is removed from the hierarchy, a bad access error will occur at the line code[self addChildfbFrame]code.p  pAm I understand the block memory management incorrectly And is there a way to solve that kind of problemp

Negative 247 pI am trying to rapidly publish messages to my server via Websockets. For each message the server gets I store it in the form timestamp message in my HashMap.

Negative 247 pSpecifically, I have areas of my heavily JS web page that contain lists of HTML elements and for simplicity lets assume there are just two lists A and B.  Lets also say When I click on the first item in list A A1 something happens to the first item in list B B1.  p  pI gave each element in list A a common HTML class and an ID like codeltli classlistAmember id1gt...ltligtcode.  I set up elements in list B in a similar way like codeltli classlistBmember id1gtcode.  Then I attached some codeclickcode handlers using jQuery in this case and ran into problems with duplicate IDs, even if I qualified my jQuery idbased selectors with the class name, like thisp  pcode.listAmember1.clickfunctioncodep  pIve realised that this is bad practice IDs are supposed to be unique in the document but Im unsure what good alternatives there are.p  pI dont really want to create IDs like codelistAmember1code because if I have, say, a lookuptable in my JS code that is keyed on the numeric ID, Id need to parse out the code1code from that ID string to get the real ID. And I would still need to add a class like codelistAmembercode for styling purposes and that seems unnecessarily repetitious  All in all that seems clumsy and I assume there are better waysp

Negative 247 pThere have been a lot of discussions about how to position a codeMediaControllercode and most answers are to use the codesetAnchorViewcodeMethod. At the first glance this solution seems to work but in my case it doesnt.p  pAccording to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma110846921717588Posta codesetAnchorViewcode only acts as a reference for initial positioning of the codeMediaControllercode, but actually creates a new floating codeWindowcode on top. p  pSo what I want is a codeMediaControllercode that is strongreallystrong bound to a parent codeViewcode e.g. VideoView. p  pFor example if you have a codeLinearLayoutcode within a codeScrollViewcode and you have to scroll down to your codeVideoViewcode where the codeMediaControllercode is attached to, the codeMediaControllercode should really be attached to this codeVideoViewcode so that the codeMediaControllercode scrolls along with the codeVideoViewcode.p  pAnother UseCase where this problem accurs is discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22564658mediacontrollernotswipinginviewpagerherea, where the codeMediaControllercode is used within a codeViewPagercode.p  pSo how to achieve such a behavior for a codeMediaControllercodep
Negative 247 pThis is a general patternsbest practices question. Im using C but I think its equally applicable to Java and other environments. Its very common for libraries to expose a builder class that goes somewhat hand in hand with a more serviceoriented class. Take a hypothetical ORM that allows you to do thisp  precodevar sql  SQLBuilder.Select.FromUsers var users  db.ExecQueryltUsergtsql codepre  pAs a library developer its tempting to combine these into a more fluent, discoverable API with only one object to be concerned withp  precodevar users  db.Select.FromUsers.ExecQueryltUsergt codepre  pNote that the difference is strictly in the API surface under the hood wed still have multiple classes with proper separation of concerns.p  pOne potential drawback of the second approach is testability. In the first approach, its much easier to stub out the service object. But what if the library developer took care of this by exposing some sort of static codeTestModecode property that can be configured on app startup or test setup and signals that the service calls should be recordedfakedp  pFrom a purist standpoint, other than testability, is there anything wrong with the second approach Im actually debating whether to do this in a couple libraries Im working on, and my main red flag is that the first approach just seems so much more common.p

Negative 247 pI have encountered a very weird problem. Sometimes when I click page jump links, parts of the website become blank. If I hover a blank area, then all the website reappears. I cant use chrome inspect to debug this, because if I enable it everything becomes normal again. p  pIt seems to be a Chrome bug and it only happened on two computer out of a total of 12 I tested this on. p  pI am currently using Chrome Version 33.0.1750.154 mp  pOne of the pages that have this problem is a hrefhttpwww.android.gsbestandroidappsoftheweek8 relnofollowherea.p  pHere you can see a screenshot of the problem.p  pI have tried deleting cookies, history and cache, then tried on incognito and it still happens.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd11RX.png altenter image description herep

Negative 247 pIm using a third party software in my Maven Project. The API calls are same for both Windows and Mac OS but the JAR files are different. Is there a way to identify the operating system at runtime and load appropriate jar from my lib folder in a Maven Project  I want to be able to provide this final executable Jar to my client who may use my final Jar in an Windows or Mac OS and should be able to work on it by including my Jar in his project. For now, my client is including the Jar in his class path which seems as a horrible way of doing.p

Negative 247 pIm moving a Rails app which loads new views through URLs to a completely AJAX version. The way were doing this is that loading all views through AJAX and changing the URL through HTML5 History API. We also want to use HTTP caching throughout so that we can cache each partial.p  pBut now were stuck on one issue. There are now essentially two ways to load each page  through the URL or by clicking on something which loads that partial via AJAX. But this has lead us to create two different views and controllers for essentially loading the same thing  one directly from URL and one by clicking in the main page and loading via AJAX and history API. So how do we ensure that the same view loads from the browser cache when loading directly via URL and with AJAXp  pTo give an example, GitHub uses in their tree slider. You can access code directly by browsing to it in the window or directly using the URL path for it. Im sure if the page has been loaded before, they get parts of it from the browser cache. p  pIs there a way to send requests to the same URL but just render a partial or load the whole page depending on whether the request is sent by clicking on the tab or entered in the address bar It should use cached partials if they are already there in the browser.p  pThanksp

Also, regarding operatorMatrix constamp A, Vector constamp V, is lazy evaluation of any help  Sidenote I am using the Eigen Library p  pNote I am aware of a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8949388willthecompileroptimizerepeatedmathcomputationsWill the compiler optimize repeated math computationsa. However, please note that my problem is harder for the compiler, since operatorMatrix constamp A, Vector constamp V is not a builtin, and hence the compiler should need some garantees about it p  pstrongEditstrongp  pAfter further thinking an this citation from Wikipedia a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOptimizingcompiler relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOptimizingcompilerap  blockquote   pFor example, in some languages functions are not permitted to have   side effects. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same   function with the same arguments, the compiler can immediately infer   that the functions result need be computed only once. In languages   where functions are allowed to have side effects, another strategy is   possible. The optimizer can determine which function has no side   effects, and restrict such optimizations to side effect free   functions. This optimization is only possible when the optimizer has   access to the called function.p blockquote  pit seems like the compiler can replace the second function by the first one provided operator is pure that is no side effect. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma54641141583122httpstackoverflow.coma54641141583122a, in C, purity can be garanteed to the compiler by telling it that a function is constexpr, has only constexpr function calls, and has const arguments. So I think it would be possible for a compiler to garantee such an optimization, provided some requirements are met. Further, note that restrictions on constexpr functions have been greatly reduced in C14p

Negative 247 pSo Im writing in C using Azure Service Bus, but those details dont matter so much, as Im looking for a design pattern, not a code chunk. We have client data across several data centres, and we canwill have multiple worker processes in those data centres. What Im trying to do is have the ability to take a list of clients, split them out by data centre unique identifiers and do some work with the clients data using the workers that are in the same data centre so we arent dragging massive amounts of data all across the continent.p  pIm leaning towards having a separate queue for each data centre, but if we choose that as our design pattern, wed very quickly run in to massive numbers of queues to monitor, one per operation per warehouse. Id thought of topics multicast filtered pubsub but then you have to route to workers at the data centre level, and your router service starts becoming a bottleneck for requests coming in to the data centre.p  pAnother issue is minimizing configuration duplication How does a worker know what data centre its in and what queues it should be looking for How do the message creators know what queues to use Do they need to be data centre aware with respect to routing their own messages Should they bep  pI had a lot of trouble finding any other information on message queueing patterns that spanned data centres, so Im hoping someone has a bit of experience theyd be willing to share.p
Negative 247 pI am currently making an app which displays the users profile. For that purpose, I used an UITableViewCell with custom cells for the different types of data phone numbers, mail addresses, etc.... There is a maximum of 8 cells per profile.p  pThe user is allowed to edit its profile in the simplest way. When the tableviews editing mode is triggered, all editable labels are replaced by textfields. And then turned back to labels when the modifications are finished.p  pHomever, there seems to be a problem with the cells that are not visible. Everytime they reappear in the view, they are reloaded, the setEditingYES method is triggered again, etc... Because of this, every change made in the textfield is lost.p  pIs there a way to prevent the tableview to remove the nonvisible cells and to add them back  There are only eight cells, so it wouldnt be very resources consuming, and I wouldnt have to save their state everytime a change is made.p  pPS  I have tried several things with the dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier method and the identifiers of each cell, but I have not managed to achieve what I want. Everytime I hide a cell, its content is refreshed.p
Negative 247 pI have an android app which contains alot of TextViews which display incoming data of different types think speed, direction, temperature, levels.... However only a handful are visible on any one screen. p  pSo my question is  What is the lightest implementation should i have one broadcast receiver to unpack the incoming data and update the various Textviews as appropriate  complex or have each TV register its own receiver and update itself as appropriate  simple. p  pI am not sure how much overhead all the receivers have. For now I have implemented as the second option above as it nicely encapsulates the functionality, however i notice that receivers for off screen views are still firing and there is no onPauseonResume methods for Views so cant registerunregister the receivers. Responsiveness is important so I want to keep the app as light as possible.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 247 pI am new at programming and I had some knowledge of Arduino C coding, however, I wanted to move over to more complex coding for Raspberry Pi in Python. I like how in Arduino you can just enter loop, however, I cannot find anything similar in Python. I am coding a program that repeatedly checks the time, and when the time hits a certain point, it starts another function in the code. The while True loop does not seem to work. Please disregard the formatting in the coding. When I copied it the formatting was screwed up. The coding is a basic idea of my main program. When it hits the time, I need it to print something. p  precode    while True         import datetime         if datetime.time is 12, 15, 17, 000000            print TEST            break codepre

Negative 247 p1 I have a Dragon Board APQ8060A and I would like to build a SPI master in dragon board to control the external peripheral device through the SPI link. I gone through the Intrinsyc Dragon Board Development Kit SPI User Guidev1.0 document and I came to know that I can configure TV tuner card as a SPI slave on GSBI1 i.e GPIO no 6,7,8,9.To configure  SPI interface I need to configure the GSBI ,QUP and Minicore related registers specifically for the SPI operations.I want to know that what are the other peripheral which are available on board which I can configure as SPI slave or How can I varify the functionality of SPI interface on dragonboard with out using the TV tuner cardp  p2 After referring the Chip Datasheet for APQ8060A I came to knew that I can configure bit 8 of SPICONFIG register register add 0x0300 to put SPI in loop back mode but I am not able to figure out the exact configurations required to test the loop back.If anyone has idea,Please share.p

Negative 247 pI am moving a java implementation of a syntactic analysis tool into python. The java implementation is using codeedu.stanford.nlp.trees.Treescode but on python i am using nltk trees. I am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdasmithstanfordcorenlppython relnofollowthisa way to access the stanford parser from python. At certain points in the processing of sentences i have to check if the items in the parsed tree are prepreterminals and this is how its done with java codeif tree.isPrePreTerminalcode however that method does not seem to be implemented in the nltk trees. Is there a way of doing this within nltk without implementing the code myself.

Negative 247 pI am trying to write a program using two methods that determines if a sub array is located within an array. subArray is supposed to receive two arrays and return the index of the start of the sub array within the array.

Currently if I pass in array 1,2,3 and sub array 2,3, it returns 2 as the starting position but it should return 1. If I pass in array 1,2,3,4,5 and sub array 4, it returns 1, but it should return 3.

Negative 247 pI try to implement a version of software transactional memory library in java with some sort of scheduler which holds some Thread objects. I want to implement a mechanism where the scheduler tells the Thread to immediatly stop execution, drop its Runnable, create a new one and rerun it. This is really half cooked so far but what I dont want is to recreate the hole Thread because it will work as a state holder for several Variables deepcopies of other variables only the Thread has  copy tasks are a choke here so the Thread should not be fully recreated p  pMy problem is that I dont know about anything that terminates a method while it executes and frees all the resources If the scheduler tells the thread to restart everything the Runnable did is invalid and must be redone and start the run method again with fresh input variables. p  pThe goal is to avoid unecesarry executions and there should be no variable in the runnable which asks if it was interreupted to then skip the execution or something. Just stop the execution and kill it from something the runnable itself is not aware off. I hope its clear what I want if not please ask for the unclear points help would be very appreciated p

Negative 247 pSo Ive got a table view which display a number of dots depending on some other data. Each cell in the table view contains a different number, and needs to display a certain number of dots according to that number. So for example, cell 1 corresponds to 5 dots, cell 2 corresponds to 3 dots, so on.p  pSince all the cells contain at least one dot, I have created a prototype cell which contains a single dot called a dotView, which is a custom View that I am using.p  pI would like to basically duplicate the dot several times to match the number that I need.p  pThe dots are aligned and positioned vertically, so I just need to copy and paste the dotView above itself, but treat it as a separate view so I can access its members without altering any of the other dotViews.p  pIf successful, will I need to set the auto layout parameters myself Or will it inherit some of the prototypes valuesp

Negative 247 pIs there anyway we can perform a partition aware operation on Hazelcast distributed queuep  pSo for example, I would have multiple consumer nodes on a queue, and would expect similar type of messages to be processed by the same node everytime. By similar type, I mean some business key for the message.p  pCurrently we are having a distributed streaming data processing ecosystem, by consuming messages from local entry listener on a IMap. A particular object model property is set as the key, so we know the models are distributed in partitions key wise. The processing logic can thus be executed locally and without using a distributed lock or any lock at all as per design contract. I would expect the similar behaviour using a distributed blocking queue instead.p  pIs that feasible Using Hazelcast 3.3.3p

Negative 247 pBefore jumping into development, Id like to get feedback on a change Im thinking of making, moving from mongo to couch.p  pBasically Ive got a webapp which is used to help organize users activities todolist, calendar, notes, journal.  It currently uses mongodb, but im thinking to move it to couch, mainly due to couches replication ability, and clientdb interaction pouchdb.  I have a similar homegrown setup on the browser using localstorage, backed by mongo, but am looking for a more mature solution.p  pDue to how couchdb differs from mongodb, Im thinking that each user should have their own couch db, and their documents being each of my app components.  Basically I have to move everything up a level with couch due to local db replication, and due to security.  p  pI have 3 questions.p  p1 I assume that couch does not have document level securityauthentication, correct  Hence me moving each user assets to their own database, good ideap  p2 My plan is have users login to the website, then my backend nodejs code authenticates them, and sends them down some authsession token.  The javascript on the client then uses its local pouchdb data to set itself up, and also sends the replication request directly to the couchdb server using the auth token it got from my serverside process.  They should only have access to their database, since I can do per database auth access correct What do you think of that setup  It should workp  p3 Regarding couchdb service providers, why do they vary so much on their couch version  IE, happycouch, 1.6.1, iris 1.5, cloudant, 1.0.2  And I also hear about couchdb 2.0 coming out soon...  Id like to use cloudant, but 1.0.2 is so many versions back from a 1.6 or 1.5, if Im not doing anything exotic, does it matterp  pBonus question p  Continuing from the last question, do you know of any services that host node.js and have local instances of couchdb available  Id like to use my backend server code as a proxy, but not at the expense of another network hop.  p  pThank you very much for your feedback, Paulp

Negative 247 pI am writing an applet that I eventually want to put online so that my friendsfamily can use it. I have the applet running now locally, but in order to work properly it needs to read a .ser file in when the applet opens, and update that same file when the applet closes.

The class HTTPURLConnection seems like an option to read it, but not write it. Any free web hosting that I have seen will not allow a file that big to be uploaded.p  pThe size of the file should hopefully go down substantially, it is a list of 2.8 million musical artists, many of which Im sure nobody using the program will ever encounter, but if this program is to be effective, many artists will have to be stored, so the problem most likely remains the same.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 247 pI am trying to create a spider via scrapy to crawl a website and extract all links for specific stores. Ultimately, the spider would then use those store links to extract pricing information. The site is designed to break down store information into States and Regions. I have been able to extract all sub links for the Statesregions, but I cannot seem to extract the specific information for the stores, that information being the store links. p  pI thought it had to do with the page not being loaded long enough for those store links to display. So I used selenium and delayed the timing by 20 seconds to allow appropriate time for the webpage to load. An example link would be a hrefhttpsweedmaps.comdispensariesinunitedstatescolorado relnofollowhttpsweedmaps.comdispensariesinunitedstatescoloradoa and as you can see on the left hand side there is information for specific stores.

Negative 247 pI have a C program that needs to verify the signature of a file that has been signed with GPG using a specific private key. Using GPGME I have successfully written a program that verifies that the given file has been properly signed with a private key corresponding to one of the public keys in the GPG keyring.p  pNow I would like my program to verify the file using a public key that is hard coded inside my program instead of just verifying the signature using one of the public keys available in the GPG keyring. p  pI want my program that will be installed on someone elses computer to be able to verify that the file really comes from me. If it does the verify operation by using the list of public key in the GPG keyring of the users computer, it seems like that user could just resign my file with his own private key and my program would validate the files signature even though I didnt sign it.p  pIs there any way of achieving this with GPGME Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 247 pI have a C application that is designed solely for 64bit systems. Currently I am working on the Windows implementation of the packfile system. The packfiles themselves incorporate a few thousand individually compressed files into them. The access pattern is expected to be multiple threads accessing different files at different times, but those individual files are almost always accessed sequentially. The files are expected to remain memory mapped for the duration of the program, accessed sporadically but often in short bursts where many files are accessed at once.p  pWhat is the best way to maximize the ability of Windows to perform readahead optimizations in this casep  pMy concern with a single file mapping is that the access is then not really sequential, but is basically entirely random with local sequentiality. I see two options, but I dont know which is better, or if another option is preferredp  ol liCreate a new file handle to the packfile for each subfile I wish to memory map, then CreateFileMapping and MapViewOfFile for each.li liCreate a single file handle to the packfile, and then create a unique file mapping for each subfile.li ol  pMy gut feeling is that 1 will let Windows do the best job, but I worry about having tons of file handles allocated.

My question isp  pI have to run all my cron job as per codeCSTcode time zone. for e.g. I saved an event whose starttime is saved from codeISTcode timezone or may be another timezone lets say code20150909 0606pmcode but actually it saved in codeUTCcode timezone on aws server, so how do I check on server that event start time is under 15 minutes as per codeCSTcode time zone. p  pActullay I want to run a cron when time in codeCSTcode timezone is equal to code20150909 0551pmcode. Please let me know how to do this in ruby on rails. p

This DataTemplate contains UserControl inside. Assume that this is just empty usercontrol from VS template. When im open first tab  this control ctor is called, corresponding viewmodel creates, and DataContextChanged event is raised. But opening any other tab, or reopening this one doesnt affect on creating this UserControl  its still those control instance that was created for the first tab opening. Same thing with viewmodel ctor not called and event not raising. Please help me to find out a way to instantiate this user control from datatemplate every time im open tab OR every time im open NEW tab both variants suits and destroy it every time im closing tab. Ive read a lot articles about this, but only thing i found is to use p  precodexSharedfalse  codepre  pon DataTemplate. But this workaround isnt working for me.p  pP.S. My final goal is to provide Tabspecific data to DataTemplates inner UserControl using mvvm pattern. every tab stores a lot information inside. This information is separated into usercontrols with its own view model. I want to customize displaying data for each tab controls by binding it to current tab model. Like so TabsViewModel stores Collection TabModel stores Model, Control1VMModel, Control2VMModel, ...p
Negative 247 pI have been researching on how to rotate text to align vertically beside a table. I have somehow manage to get the text to vertically align, but I feel like the way I did it is rather not a smart way to code it. Another problem I encounter is when I resize my window, the grid in which the vertical text is within, overlaps with the table beside it. Does anyone know how to fix this problem or know how to align the vertical text dead center of the grid with the height of the adjacent tablep  pI would prefer the vertical text to appear horizontally, when the window is resized. But I feel like im asking a lot. However, if anyone do know and are willing to share, please dop  pBelow is the code in which Im working on.

Negative 247 pIm working on a site that uses an iframe to display all content. Its a huge pain but theres nothing I can do about it at this juncture. I have a function in place somewhere that resizes the iframe based on the content. When I call a bootbox confirm or alert, however, it bases its positioning on the scroll position of the iframe I assume. Since the iframe is always as tall as its content, it never requires scrolling so the bootbox dialogs always appear at the top of the iframe. I can successfully position the dialogs based on the scroll position of the parent frame like so...p  precode.modaldialog.csstop,parent.window.document.scrollTop codepre  p...but I have to do that every time a bootbox is called. Im seeking a better way.p  pIs there a way to do this via the API Modify the js filep  pEDIT Ive also employed scrollTo to scroll to the top but thats not very elegant.p

Negative 247 pI have recently started learning Haskell and have been trying my hand at Parsec. However, for the past couple of days I have been stuck with a problem that I have been unable to find the solution to. So what I am trying to do is write a parser that can parse a string like thisp  precodeltapple, pear, pineapple, orangegt codepre  pThe code that I wrote to do that isp  precodecollection  Parser [String]     collection  char lt gt string sepBy char , lt char gt  string  Parser String string  char  gt many noneOf [, r, n, ] lt char  codepre  pThis works fine for me as it is able to parse the string that I have defined above. Nevertheless, I would now like to enforce the rule that every element in this collection must be unique and that is where I am having trouble. One of the first results I found when searching on the internet was a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions3098391uniqueelementsinahaskelllistthisa one, which suggest the usage of the codenubcode function. Although the problem stated in that question is not the same, it would in theory solve my problem. But what I dont understand is how I can apply this function within a Parser. I have tried adding the nub function to several parts of the code above without any success. Later I also tried doing it the following wayp  precode collection  Parser [String]  collection  do   char lt   value lt string sepBy char ,   char gt   return nub value codepre  pBut this does not work as the type does not match what codenubcode is expecting, which I believe is one of the problems I am struggling with. I am also not entirely sure whether codenubcode is the right way to go. My fear is that I am going in the wrong direction and that I wont be able to solve my problem like this. Is there perhaps something I am missing Any advice or help anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.p

Thus I will end up with both an codeelapsed.matchcode and an codeelapsed.endwithoutstartcode in each end log. I want to record which one was matched  that was my attempt with the codeaddtagcode in each filter. p  pHowever what I end up with are the following tags on my end logp  precodetaskEnd, elapsedmatchsub, elapsed.endwtihoutstart, elapsedmatchjob, elapsed, elapsed.match codepre  pSo both of the elapsed filters are considered to match for the purposes of doing the codeaddtagcode.  Is there some way I can make adding a tag conditional on the codeelapsed.matchcode having been added by that particular codeelapsedcode filterp

Negative 247 pI am working on a javacanvas based editor for creating textured shapes. The results are later rendered in OpenGL but I need to simulate the interpolation of the color pixels from a texture. br br Assume I have a texture with 10 texel by 1 texel. I specifiy a range from 0.0 to 1.0 for a part of a canvas. So I interpolate the texture coordinate of each canvas pixel, find the two neighbouring texels and interpolate the color.br br Now I want to draw from tex 0.0 to 2.0 with the texture being repeated. A modulo calculation is already not trivial anmyore, because 1.0, 2.0, ... need to be mapped to 1.0, while 1.x, 2.x, ... need to be mapped to 0.x.br br So far i got this to work even for negative values. However the interpolation is cut of when the wrapping occurs. The range between the last texel 1.0 and the repeated first texel 0.0 is not respected.br br How do I simulate that correctly I guess I have to deal with the half pixeltexel offset. I want 0.01.0 to draw the texture once, 0.02.0 to draw it twice and 1.02.0 to draw it three times and so on with correct interpolation where the texture is repeated. This has to be possible with some simple shifting and modulo formulas rightbr br Is there maybe some cheap trick like adding two more texels on the outsides for continuous interpolation and doing some offset magic to fix scaling issuesp

The my script runs in an infinite loop, so when I login it is supposed to be running but it is not. I made another script and added another line in the rc.local script start it too. My second script also runs in an infinite loop but it does not talks to the internet.

Negative 247 pI am trying to learn Haskell and struggling with binary IO. This code is adapted from the code given in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma322547754725700this answera to one of my earlier questions.p  pI am trying to read a lot of codeWord32code values and a few codeWord8code values metadata from a given file.

Negative 247 pI have a working program where the view model feed the data to the view. This is done in the constructor and also in a emRefreshem method, as shown below. I usually put a private property referring to the view model because I want to omit casting when communicating with it.p  precodepublic class TheView    private ViewModel TheViewModel  get set     public TheView        TheViewModel  new ViewModel     DataContext  TheViewModel       public Refresh        TheViewModel  new ViewModel     DataContext  TheViewModel     codepre  pThen, I got gready and started chasing lines. Since the constructor connects emDataContextem to the property emTheViewModelem, I figured I could just assign to the latter and the former would get its stuff updated by itself. To my disappointment, I discovered that it wasnt so. The following get me the correct list of objects strongbutstrong the emDataContextem stays unaffected.p  precodepublic class TheView    private ViewModel TheViewModel  get set     public TheView        TheViewModel  new ViewModel     DataContext  TheViewModel       public Refresh  TheViewModel  new ViewModel   codepre  pThe question is why it is so. Or rather, if its supposed to be so. Im thinking, in case it isnt supposed to behave like this, perhaps I have issues elsewhere in the code that poofs the flow...p
