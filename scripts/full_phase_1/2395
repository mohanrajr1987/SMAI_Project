Positive 2395 pI a hrefhttpsaurzcode.in201501hivesortvsordervsdistributevscluster relnofollowread a littlea about the difference between order by and cluster by operations in Hive. As I understand it, order by gives you global ordering at the cost of running all the data through one reducer, which can cause the cluster to choke if there is too much data and I didnt find a good explanation to what is too much to pass through that reducer.p  pCluster by on the other hand partition the data to different reducers and sort it in the reducer level, so you end up with N sorted partitions files but there is no guarantee for global ordering if you simply stitch the files together. The issue of global ordering is not clear as the difference of opinions was not settle in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13715044hiveclusterbyvsorderbyvssortbythis answera.p  pI have a job in which I need to load 180M rows, group them in groups of 24 by a certain columns combination, operate a certain function on that group and store it back to hadoop.p  pSince the applied function on the group is not a trivial one, I do the calculation I need in code. So I use ORDER BY to get the rows in the order I need, then Im batch fetching the query results Hive client in java, batches of 10000 rows, apply my function and store the result back in a DB. This process is very heavy on the cluster and I need to redesign it.p  pFirst option is to write a udf and use group by instead of order by etc. Second and more preferred option is to use cluster by instead of order by. The uncertainty I have here is about the mechanism of batch fetching of the hive client and also the final write of the query result back to hadoop. p  pIf I need to guess, I would guess that after the cluster by ended up with sorted partitions in multiple reducers, the result is somehow randomly first to finish first to write another layer of sorting on top of the sorted partitions written to a temporary table and the hive client if fetching blocks from there. My concern is whether the entire write ends before the client start batch fetching, or whether it is greedy and start fetching the moment some data of any reducer is ready. because if the latter is true, then I might fetch a block from one reducer and the next fetch will be from a different reducer which will ruin my between two fetches state.p  pCan someone clear up the missing spots       p

Why do they both work fine, but as soon as I apply other filters on them, everything gets mixedp  pI even tried to create a temporary table with the WITH clause, and use Date and LogType filters on that, but it still didnt work. Several results that shouldve been included with the filters were suddenly left out. When originally I would get the first dated only name, or the second name if there were several from the LogName column, now I would randomly get whatever, if any. In a similar manner, using iWHERE DATE BETWEEN 2007111 AND 20071130i would cause a permaloop, where using iWHERE MONTHDate  11 AND YEARDate  2007i would work fine. But if I added one more filter to the latter option, for example i.. AND WHERE LogType  Criticali, itd be on permaloop again. Both permaloops happened with Langs solution.p  pI need to combine this type of search with another using UNION ALL, so Im wondering if Im going to run into any more similarly weird problems in the future with that Theres clearly something I dont understand about SQL here, and my DL for the query is today so Im kinda stressed out here. Thx for all the help. p  pbEdit bTo clarify. In need the result of the queries above, and those results need to be filtered to critical cases over a given time month ONLY.p  pThis will then be united with another search that returns the first time a FBID with Support status LogType has been logged. The idea is to give a picture of how many new cases are recorded in the DB each month.p  pbEdit 2b Update, Russ Cams suggestion below is working, but it rules out any FBIDs that were first dated outside the given range, even if the query result row where the LogName changes, would exist within range.p

Negative 2395 pI am currently using the a hrefhttpwww.jboss.orgjbossrichfaces relnofollowJBoss RichFacesa JSF component library for the project I am working on. It works quite well in general, especially the AJAX support provided by ajax4jsf A4J, but I find the usually very inflexible tablemarkup used for almost every component and all this skin stuff of RichFaces quite annoying.

Originally I had planned to use ICEfaces, but that didnt work too well either and also brings a lot of predefined styles with it, so for now RichFaces seems to be the best option.p  pNow I thought it would be nice to develop a clean tag library which provides some useful components found in RichFaces, ICEfaces or Tomahawk not all of course, which dont use any predefined style and generate markup which can be styled easily with CSS.p  pI wanted to use the ajax4jsf library for AJAX support, because I think it works quite nicely, and integrates seamlessly into standard JSF with facelets.

Negative 2395 pThis question is related to others I have asked on here, mainly regarding sorting huge sets of data in memory.p  pBasically this is what I want  havep  pTwisted XMLRPC server running.  This server keeps several 32 instances of Foo class in memory.  Each Foo class contains a list bar which will contain several million records.  There is a service that retrieves data from a database, and passes it to the XMLRPC server.  The data is basically a dictionary, with keys corresponding to each Foo instance, and values are a list of dictionaries, like sop  precodedata  foo1[k1v1, k2v2, k1v1, k2v2], foo2... codepre  pEach Foo instance is then passed the value corresponding to its key, and the Foo.bar dictionaries are updated and sorted.p  precodeclass XMLRPCControllerxmlrpc.XMLRPC      def initself         ...         self.foos  foo1Foo, foo2Foo, foo3Foo         ...      def updateself, data         for k, v in data             threads.deferToThreadself.foos[k].processData, v      def getDataself, fookey          return first 10 records of specified Foo.bar         return self.foos[fookey].bar[010]  class Foo      def initself         bar  []      def processDataself, newbardata         for record in newbardata              do processing, and add record, then sort              BUNCH OF PROCESSING CODE             self.bar.sortreverseTrue codepre  pThe problem is that when the update function is called in the XMLRPCController with a lot of records say 100K  it stops responding to my getData calls until all 32 Foo instances have completed the processdata method.  I thought deferToThread would work, but I think I am misunderstanding where the problem is.p  pAny suggestions...

Negative 2395 pIm starting to architect a quite complex web application. The implementation is probably going to be done in PHP, though if there are impressive reasons to choose a different environment I might be convinced.p  pIve looked at tools like Symfony and CakePHP.

They handle the basic things like MVC and scaffolding, but not the more advanced UI elements that Im looking for. Here are some of my requirementsp  ul liSingle page architecture. With minor exceptions, there should be no page refresh. All actions are done via ajax, the way its done in gmail, and to a lesser extent in Facebook.li liAjax layout and widget handling. Not only the application doesnt refresh the page, but the developer can specify the layout and load various widgets into different parts of the page. This is somewhat like iGoogle, but should be better integrated.li liSupport both on the client side and server side for AJAX widgets. It should be trivial to display the result of a select statement in an AJAX tablearray like a hrefhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comyuidatatable relnofollowhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comyuidatatablea. This should also apply to other widgets including ul liTreesli liMenusli liFormsli ulli liSpeaking of forms, there should be easy integration with emclient sideem validation  li liSignupAuthenticationAuthorization. Including all the housekeeping things like forgot my password, CAPTCHAs, etc.li ul  pTheres more, but I think Ive given enough details so that you get an idea for what Im looking for. Basically, Id like to engineer a modern Web 2.0 app and skip writing, testing, debugging things that most web applications need to do. And yes, I know I can take YUI or jQuery and slap it on top of one of the regular platforms, but then Id have to write all the glue. Now if there are modules that do this, that would be interesting.  So if you say, take Symfony  modules xyz  jQuery and theres your answer, Id be happy to hear that.p  pFinally, in terms of priority, Im looking for something thats scalable, reliable, well engineered more than something thats easy to learn and deploy.p

Negative 2395 pI have been curious about better ways to cross browser test than those screenshot services or maintaining my own array of VMs to VNC into. Then today I found crossbrowsertesting.com which seems to allow you to connect from your browser via VNC to one of their machines running virtually any browser. This is really similar to a solution I had been thinking about, but veered away for a few reasons. I have two questions about this servicep  ol liif you have used the service, what are its prosconsli lihow do they get around people doing all kinds of nasty things on their VMs, since they give you a full desktop to play around in.li ol  pBonus how do they get around the legal issues regarding people VNCing into Windows and using IE when the connecting clients clearly do not own the softwarep

Negative 2395 pThe goatse operator or the codecode idiom in Perl causes an expression to be evaluated in list context. p  pAn example isp  precodemy str  5 and 4 and a 3 and 2 1 BLAST OFF my count  str  dg  5 matches... print There are count numbers in your countdown...nn codepre  pAs I interprete the use, this is what happensp  ol licodestr  dgcode matches all the digits. The codegcode switch and list context produces a list of those matches. Let this be the List Producer example, and in Perl this could be many things.li lithe codecode causes an assignment to an empty list, so all the actual matches are copied to an empty list.li liThe assignment in scalar context to count of the list produced in 2. gives the count of the list or the result of 5.li liThe reference count of the empty list codecode goes to zero after the scalar assignment. The copy of the list elements is then deleted by Perl. li ol  pThe questions on efficiency are thesep  ol liAm I wrong in how I am parsing this li liIf you have some List Producer and all you are interested in is the count, is there a more efficient way to do this li ol  pIt works great with this trivial list, but what if the list was hundreds of thousands of matches With this method you are producing a full copy of every match then deleting it just to count them.p

Negative 2395 pOn the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.security.membership.applicationname.aspx relnofollowMSDN pagea for the codeMembership.ApplicationNamecode property which applies to an asp.net membership provider, it warns that although one can change codeMembership.ApplicationNamecode in code, The ApplicationName property is not thread safe for multiple writes, and changing the ApplicationName property value can result in unexpected behavior for multiple users of an application.  They therefore recommend avoiding using it for a web application.p  pThis is because the default codeSqlMembershipProvidercode is written as a singleton.  But heres my question is it OK if all the threads in my application process are going to set codeMembership.ApplicationNamecode to strongthe same thingstrongp  pIm thinking of having multiple applications on my IIS box, each with their own separate application pool.  I want to point them to the same location, but based on the hostname, set the application provider to different things.  Wouldnt this actually be OK  It might not be a threadsafe operation, but doesnt each application pool have its own process and therefore its own instance of codeSqlMembershipProvidercode  So, every thread that tried to set codeMembership.ApplicationNamecode for a given codeSqlMembershipProvidercode instance would be trying to set it to the same thing the provider that is appropriate for that hostname.  Or am I missing somethingp  pI guess the main question is, do ALL asp.net applications share one codeSqlMembershipProvidercode, or is a separate one created for each application pool processp

Negative 2395 pIm developing an embedded Linux system that runs from compact flash and tmpfs. The flash is mounted readonly and should normally stay that way, but occasionally I need to write something to the flash.p  pWhat precautions should I take when writing to flash through a PATA interface For reasons I cant recall, Im using an codeext4code filesystem mounted with codebarrier1,dataordered,nodelalloc,noatime,rocode Is any of that a horrible idea The system needs to boot quickly with zero intervention. Im tempted to do codetune2fs c 0 i 0code. Is that an even worse ideap  pAlso, when I write something, I obviously need to remount the flash readwrite, perform the write, then remount readonly. The problem is that there are several different processes both c binary and shell scripts that may need to do this. Clearly having each process indiscriminately remount the filesystem readonly when its done is a bad idea.p  pWhats the best way to coordinate this codeflockcode looks promising is that the best way to go and what do I need to be worried about I dont want a stale lock to block writes or leave the filesystem writable indefinitely.p  pemstrongTo clarifyemstrong By occasional writing, I mean the system could go for years without needing to write anything. When something does get written, its maybe a couple hundred bytes. In the mean time, the system needs to endure unpredictable power cycles without any intervention.p

If I render the hidden input field for ID when adding a post, I get an error stating that the ID cant be null.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong I went with OJs answer for this question, however I discovered something that made me feel silly and I wanted to share it just in case anyone was having a similar issue. The page that addsedits blogs does not even need a hidden field for id, ever. The reason is because when I go to add a blog I do a GET to this relative URL codeBlogProjectAdminAddBlogPostcodep  pThis URL does not contain an ID and the action method just renders the page. The page does a POST to the same URL when adding the blog post. The incoming codeBlogPostcode entity is populated by model binding and has a null Id that will be generated by EF during save changes.p  pNow when editing a blog post the URL is codeBlogProjectAdminEditBlogPostIdcode This URL contains the id of the blog post and since the page is posting back to the exact same URL the id goes with the POST to the action method that executes the edit.p  pThe only problem I encountered with this is that the action methods cannot have identical signatures.p  precode[HttpGet] public ViewResult EditBlogPostint Id     [HttpPost] public ViewResult EditBlogPostint Id    codepre  pThe compiler will yell at you if you try to use these two methods above. It is far too convenient that the Id will be posted back when doing a codeHtml.BeginFormcode with no arguments for action or controller. So rather than change the name of the POST method I just modified the arguments to include a codeFormCollectioncode. Like thisp  precode[HttpPost] public ViewResult EditBlogPostint Id, FormCollection formCollection        You can then use formCollection as the IValueProvider for UpdateModel       and TryUpdateModel if you wish. I mean, you might as well use the       argument since youre taking it.  codepre  pThe formCollection variable is filled via model binding with the same content that codeRequest.Formcode would be by default. You dont have to use this collection for codeUpdateModelcode or codeTryUpdateModelcode but I did just so I didnt feel like that collection was pointless since it really was just to make the method signature different from its GET counterpart.p  pThanks for the help guys Let me know if you find a better way to make this work. The only part Im shaky on is taking in an unnecessary variable to make the method signature different.p

Unfortunately, the service doesnt offer authorization tokens so I very apprehensively have to store the passwords in a way that I can access their plaintext values. I dont own or control the service to which I am authenticating, and the only method is to borrow a users username and password and authenticate.p  pI am planning to AESENCRYPT the passwords in the DB, which means that if somebody is somehow able to access the DB they wont be able to get the plaintext. However my code will need to have access to the key to unencrypt them, thus if the entire server is compromised this is no protection and the passwords will be revealed. p  pAside from the abovedescribed encryption, are there any best practices or steps I can take to do this as safely as possiblep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI know that whatever I do, ultimately the passwords must be accessible in plaintext and so a compromised server means the passwords will be revealed, but I am wondering what steps I can do to mitigate my risk.

Negative 2395 pSo, I have a class that does string manipulation based on metadata attached to each character in the string. Internally, I represent this with a codestdvectorltCharacterTypegtcode where codeCharacterTypecode contains, among other things, the character in question. This internal representation is useful to me, but at the end of the manipulations the class user is interested in the string itself.p  pIn order to do this, I decided to extend codestdvectorltCharacterTypegtiteratorcode to include an codeoperatorcode method that returns a character rather than a codeCharacterTypecode. Heres the code, it works in Visual Studio 2008 on Windows 7. But is it idiomatic C I havent written much C since the 90s, so Id appreciate some feedback on the style or if Im doing something dangerous andor evil. In the code below I made a simplified codeCharacterTypecode structure called codemytypecode  in reality the structure is quite a bit bigger.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include ltstringgt  struct mytype      char c   class myit  public stdvectorltmytypegtiterator  public     inline myitstdvectorltmytypegtiterator const ampc          stdvectorltmytypegtiteratorc      char operator          const mytype ampp              stdvectorltmytypegtiteratoroperator         return p.c            Added these in a later edit, after thinking about a comment below     typedef char valuetype     typedef char pointer     typedef char ampreference  private   int main      mytype test[]   a, b, c, d      stdvectorltmytypegt vecamptest[0], amptest[4]     myit ivec.begin, evec.end     stdstring stri, e      stdcout ltlt str ltlt stdendl     return 0  codepre  pAssuming this is good style, is it appropriate to use C typeaware method overloading to have several codeoperatorcode methods in codemyitcode so that I can use the same iterator class to get another member of a different type Or would it be better to use a template For example, one piece of metadata is the characters language, and I would like to be able to extract a codestdvectorltLanguageTypegtcode in exactly the same way. Thoughtsp  pAlso, since the methods that return these data dont affect the objects internal representation, in the interest of const correctness I would like to be able to define the accessors codeconstcode. This probably means that Id need to modify the above to use a codeconstiteratorcode instead, but I havent gotten to that yet.p  pThanks for your style critiques in advancep

Negative 2395 pI have a number of collection classes that implement their own custom update notification. It should be pretty easy to translate these notifications to an codeINotifyCollectionChangedcode implementation in a proxy class.p  pcodeINotifyPropertyChangedcode is already taken care of this question is just about collection proxies.p  pSo, what Im looking for is a way of creating the proxies that is relatively easy to use from XAML. This is particularly true for subcollections. The custom collection classes are part of a library that cannot be modified nor derived from. Its also not possible to replace the collection types with codeINotifyCollectionChangedcodecompatible equivalents, because the dataupdating code is outside my control.p  pId prefer a solution that works with SL as well, but its not a strict requirement.p  pSo far, I believe the following approaches are viablep  ul liDefine a codeTypeDescriptionProvidercode registered for the collection classes that adds a codeProxycode property. This allows Binding paths to dotinto the proxy. It seems that this solution is easiest from a XAML perspective, but is not SLcompatible.li liDefine a value converter that creates the proxies. This would work with a bit more work from the XAML side. It should work for SL. However, it may require intermediate visual elements to hold the value converter result if more than one value conversion is necessary on a path.li ul  pI looked into codeObjectDataProvidercode, but I dont think it can be used in this situation the proxy creation method must be generic on the type of objects in the container.p  pAny recommendations on which of these two approaches is better, or any other approachesp

Negative 2395 pNeither g nor javac emit warnings when the parameters to nonprivate methods are of private types e.g., private nested classes. Such methods cannot be used by clients, but they can appear as part of a classs public API. p  pIn C, putting such methods into the public section of a class Foo, for example, could allow other classes to access these methods without explicitly being listed as friends inside class Foo so long as they can access the private types used as parameters.p  pBut in general, would it be bad style to not explicitly make such methods private, or can this just be ignored since clients cant use it anyway, whats the big dealp

All int fields are fine but the stdstring field gives an address out of bounds error, presumably because it points to data which is no longer there.p  pIs there a standard workaround for this I dont want to go back to char arrays but at least I know they work in this situation.

Negative 2395 pMy question regards relative and absolute addresses.p  pI have over the years built a framework, which all my php websites are built on.p  pEvery single page is loaded in the top level index.php file. This is cool, because I never struggle with paths to resources.  Every single resource, at every single level of the system is referenced from the top level index file, so the paths are always similar p  pstrongiestrong img srcimagesspritesxxxxx.jpg  from every single page in the system.p  pBut now Ive ruined it by introducing modrewrite. mod rewrite seems to have confused the path system Ive been using. So its time for me to update the paths.  Stylesheets and images no longer load.p  pHow should I fix this  Is it true that relative paths are loaded faster than absolute isnt there some way in PHP to find the root of your server file system assign it to a var and then prepend that var to image paths Is that any faster than just referencing my images amp Stylesheets as httpsite.comimagesxxxx.jpg p  pI have alot to learn now.

Negative 2395 pWorking on a new way of using an already existing searchengine in an application. The idea is to use prefixes to search, instead of checking preferred values in checkboxes before searching. Something like this 12345678 whereas the searchengine would return a result for a telephonenumber.p  pThe problem is that this search consists of three values. I have two enums SearchCriteria and SearchType.

Negative 2395 pA little background, this began in the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8393456customdatatypevsarrayCustom data type vs arraya.p  pI have managed to create codestruct Statecode, and the codeListltStategtcode to go along with it.  Originally this was a multidimensional array, the purpose of which was for the 0index to be an item in a combobox, and idexes 13 to then be displayed in 3 text boxes.  My question now is, how do I duplicate this functionality by using the structList combination.  The struct contains the same 4 fields as the original Array did, but Im having problems understanding how to specify which field goes to which box.  From what Ive read elsewhere it should simply be a matter of using codestruct.fieldcode format, but it doest seem to be working. As usual its probably something simple Im missing, but I cant seem to wrap my head around it.p  pOn a side note, this list is meant to be completely immutable, none of this information is going to changebe changed if it does, it will be at the code level and Ill redo it myself, but user entry shouldnt ever affect it.p  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongStructstrongp  precodestruct

It just displays performs the rollover effect on the last element in the list. This is actually my first attempt at using jQuery so any other suggestions to ways I could jQuery inside the code would be helpful too.p  pEDIT Id also like to toggle multiple children from the arraylist mentioned in the for loop. How would I set this up I cant seem to pass an array to the jquery command without getting errors.p
Negative 2395 pSorry for such a vague title.

Negative 2395 pI am hitting a bit of a problem when using the date datatype. When trying to save a row to the table where the field it throws an error ora 01830 and complains about converting the date format picture ends...etc. Now when I do the insert, I use the todate function with the format of ddmonyyyy hh24miss. Of course, when I remove the time element, everything is perfect.p  pChecking sysdate, I noticed that the time element wasnt be displayed, and I used alter session set nlsdateformat to set the date and time I want to save to the table, which workedp  pI used alter system set nlsdateformat ddmonyyyy hh24miss scopespfile This showed that it was altered, and I can see the setting in the enterprise management console. In sqlplus, I shutdown the database, and restarted with startup mount alter database open and then selecting sysdate, it still shows the date as ddmonyy, and still no time Checking the enterprise management, and looking up the nlsdateformat the setting is still shown as ddmonyyyy hh24miss.p  pSo, my question is this  what am I doing wrong Why cant save date and time using date in Oracle 11gp  pThanksp

This is the class path of the main project, not the library project.p  pDoes anyone know of any new documentation for how to do library projects that came out since the latest tools release The existing documentation seems to no longer be valid. I used to be able to step and debug any library that was included into a top level Android App. So to fully test a library I could do it through the delivery main app. But now it seems that can no longer be done. p  pDo I need to set the library to not be a library, then debug and test the library stand alone, then set the library back to being a library right before I deliver This seems like the SDK has been crippled since the last release. p

Negative 2395 pI have a Visiblox chart with multiple Yaxes, different units on each axis.  p  pThe user can click any of several buttons to display data as line series on the appropriate axis.p  pIf the user clicks on data that plots against the primary or secondary Yaxis, its possible to zoom the plot.  If they click on data that plots on an additional Yaxis and there is no existing data on the primary or secondary Yaxis, the plot will not zoom.p  pIf there is existing data plotted against the primary or secondary Yaxis, the chart zooms fine.p  pIm guessing this is expected behavior in Visiblox, but am I missing any way to enable zooming with data plotted only on an additional Yaxisp  pI know I could keep track of which axes are active and change the units on them to make sure that data is always plotted first on one of the functioning axes, but the user can also remove data from any axis at will, and Id have to replot the data any time they removed data from the both of the functioning axes, leaving only data on the additional axis.  Possible, but messy.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2395 pI have a shapefile which is the national boundary line of Chile. If possible, I would like to randomly generate e.g. 1000 polygons within this area. Im wondering what the best way would be to go about this in R I thought maybe, loading the shapefile using the shapefiles package, then creating a point dataset using something available in spatstat. Then I could create circular polygons based around these points... This is mostly hypothetical and I dont know if its possible. p  pI have some experience in R but havent really tried any spatial analysis before. p  pAny thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated. p

Looking at the stack and running a regular expression on the last line is not a good way to accomplish this.p  pThe heart of the matter is that Python interprets lines of code left to right so when it arrives at a statement like codea.b.c  3code its first operation is a codegetattra,bcode and not a codesetattrcode so I cant determine easily if the last operation in the stack of operations is an assignment.  p  pWhat I would like to know is if there is a good way to determine the last operation in the stack of operations or at least if its a codesetattrcode. p  pEditp  pThis is the solution that I came up with thanks to user1320237s recommendation.p  precodeclass DotDictdict     def getattrself, key          Make attempts to lookup by nonexistent attributes also attempt key lookups.          if self.haskeykey             return self[key]         import sys         import dis         frame  sys.getframe1         if x00c  dis.opmap[STOREATTR] in frame.fcode.cocode             self[key]  DotDict             return self[key]          raise AttributeErrorProblem here      def setattrself, key, value         if isinstancevalue,dict             self[key]  DotDictvalue         self[key]  value codepre  pTheres a little bit more in the actual implementation but it does an awesome job.  The way it works is that it inspects the last frame in the stack and checks the byte code for a STOREATTR operation which means that the operation being performed is of the codea.b.this.doesnt.exist.yet  somethingcode persuasion.  I would be curious if this could be done on other interpreters outside of CPython.p

Notice that the Department id is always the 4 figures of the Unit, and then 2 more describing the Department.p  pSo much for the data model, the problem is that when i select a Unitand no Department, and need to list all the Documents under that Unit, the search should return all documents that belongs to that Unit AND all the documents that that belongs to ALL the departments under that Unit, and that search is taking over 4 seconds with 5000 Documents, I must do something wrong.p  pI am using a NSFetchedResultsController and here are my Predicate.p  precodeNSPredicate predicate NSFetchRequest req  [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityNameDocument]    [req setPropertiesToFetch[NSArray arrayWithObjectsname,publisher,isFavourite, nil]]  req.sortDescriptors  [NSArray arrayWithObject[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeyname ascendingYES]]  [req setFetchBatchSize15] predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatANY units.id    ANY departments.id BEGINSWITH[cd] ,self.selectedUnit.id,self.selectedUnit.id] codepre  pCan I do this in another way  I was wondering if I could select the Unit instead, and then go through Unit.documents instead, but then i think my FetchController is not needed, and i need to put the results in an Array, and sort them firstwhich fetches all Entitites, and takes even longer..p  pTo make matters worse, i also need to be able to search within the Name attribute of the documents later, and that CONTAINS[cd] makes the search even slower, I unfortunately cannot split the words into a seperate table, because I need to be able to mach words WITHIN words, that is, the user could type result and the the search should return all documents which has result somewhere in the title, an example could be NSFetchedResultControllers are coolp  pHow can I make that CONTAINS search perform better, right now i have only 5000 docs, but it could also be 20000 or more.p  pAny good ideas, thoughts  I have watched a lot of WWDC Core Data videos, read Core Data performance on the Apple developer site, I really think i have done it the right way, but maybe my model is all wrong, I can see in the SQL debug, that there is a lot of time used on joining tables, and I have tried to figure out how to make that SQL cleaner.p  pThank you very much Jacobp

Whenever the patch 10.1 is run, and the previous 10.0 install had to copy some of these files, I receive the following area while running the coderepaircodep  blockquote   pThe specified path [Path] is unavailable.p blockquote  pI have checked, and the specified path IS available.  The files that were copied into are there.  Further, the source data directory from which the files were copied from in the 10.0 install are also there.

Negative 2395 pIm new to JSF and developing web applications with Java.  Im basically developing a pretty complex interface, with lots of AJAX content loaded Pagination, posts, comments, .... p  pIll start with a basic example, a user writes a comment. The form is sent through JSF fajax to the server and then I can do a rendersectionId, but the problem is, that I want to make the post not just appear, but slide down and even toggle background color. p  pHow can I obtain this sort of effect using JSF and Javascript The designer who knows only HTMLCSSJavscriptJquery says that usually, he just does a Jquery AJAX call to a page with a string of data and then the page generates a JSON encode that he can then use to do all the magic.p  pIm not asking how you do the togglecolor in jquery, its the communication between the JSF and Javascript. So how can I send to his javascript the newly generated HTML code, so that he can what he wants with it.p  pThanks for any help.p

So I have tried to create a new instance of ToolTip each time mouse is over the notify icon and then show it rather than always using the same tooltip with different error text and window handle.  Anyway, it continues saying cannot access to a disposed object.p  precode    currentEditCellToolTip  new ToolTip     currentEditCellToolTip.Showcell.ErrorText,                                  datagridview.EditingControl, 3000 codepre  pThis ToolTip is shown when user move mouse over the area where notify icon is for the cell that is currently in edit mode and in error.p  pSo how to make tooltip to work correctly without raising any exception like commentedp  pstrongEDIT  DESCRIPTION IN DEPTHstrong A little example User is editing a cell and he enters an invalid value so I have make that cell remains in edit mode until a valid value is entered and a notify error icon by the cell is shown at its rightmost. The area rectangle that contains this notify error icon shows an errorText describing the error when user move mouse over this area. This message is shown through a tooltip. p  pImagine now, that user now enters a valid value for the current cell and change to another new cell in which he enters in edit mode and he enters an invalid value so notify error icon is shown at its rightmost for this cell and a new tooltip with the error message is shown when user move mouse over this area. And so on.... validates the current cell with a valid value and change to another new cell...p  pThe problem here is that previous tooltip that was associated with the previous cell EditingControl has gone by the time the code executes internally tooltip has a local variable, associated to the old window and this cause the exception to be raised. EditingControl has changed and associated with the new tooltip, but the old tooltip continues associated with the old EditingControl that has already gone so this cause the exception. This is a problem related to tooltip, see below linkp  pa hrefhttptechnologiques.blogspot.com.es200806tooltipandcannotaccessdisposed.html relnofollowToolTip Cannot access to a disposed objectap  pSo Is there a way to tell tooltip previous editingControl has already gone and then associated correctly the new editingControl to a new tooltip without causing any exception Do I need to destroy the previous ToolTip in some way or is it not necessaryp

Negative 2395 pI am relatively new to database design so I am still learning a lot. What I am working on is an online time card clock. I am just messing around with it to learn more. My full time job is working for my uncle operating heavy equipment and he has expressed some headaches to me. When going over time cards several employees hand writing is hard to read, several employees dont add the hours correctly so he always has to double check their math, plus some people dont hand in the time sheets on time. Most of the employees have smart phones so my solution is to just make a simple website that has a button for Clocking in and Clocking out it would also contain several text fields to describe what the employee operated that day and the job site they were on. All of this will be added to a database that will be emailed to the boss at the end of the work week. My question is what would be the best way to setup a database for this Should I add a separate table for each employee or keep it all in one table There will be about 20 employees that will use the site. Thanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 2395 pI am currently looking at redeveloping a web service that is currently written in .Net.  I would like to port it across to Java using a CXF, Spring, Hibernate and Maven stack.p  pThe WSDL for the service is already available and is well formed so I would like to reuse rather than redeveloping the interface.  This will also mean that the clients will not require significant changes in order to use the new service.p  pI would like to use a JAXWS type approach to developing the web service, similar to the Javafirst approach at a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgdocswritingaservicewithspring.html relnofollowhttpcxf.apache.orgdocswritingaservicewithspring.htmla.  The only difference being that I would like to follow a contractfirst approach and ensure that the exact WSDL is used.p  pHas anyone attempted this before  Are there any good guides online that I can refer top

Negative 2395 pThe example here httpstackoverflow.comquestions835839clientconfigurationtoconsumewcfjsonwebservice is straightforward and simple.  I have created a WCF RESTFUL JSON service that returns an array of simple objects.  In JavaScript, I have no problem dealing with what is returned, and my Web client therefore works fine.p  pI want to make this service callable from either web or C clients so that the data that is exposed can be used in multiple contexts without having to duplicate the code that gets the data.p  pIn my C code, I have the proxy client, the interface contract, and the config based binding definitions.  I share the interface and data code modules between my C service and my C client a simple console app to use as a test verification harness.p  pOn the C client, the data that is not in array form comes back great.  As soon as I make my service return an array of objects, either as a bare array return or as a wrapped property on a simple object, the serializer on the client side silently fails and returns an empty array.p  pHere is my client code at the top level p  precode  for managed code to call our AjaxJson incident service, we need to reuse the interface contract,    and use the ServiceModel.Channels infra to handcode a proxy client.  public class IncidentClient  ClientBaseltIIncidentServices.IGetActiveIncidentsgt, IIncidentServices.IGetActiveIncidents       public incidents GetActiveIncidentsstring environmentAbbreviation              return base.Channel.GetActiveIncidentsenvironmentAbbreviation          class Program       static void Mainstring[] args                IncidentClient client  new IncidentClient          incidents data  client.GetActiveIncidentsprod         Console.WriteCall to GetActiveIncidents returned          if null  data                      Console.WriteLineno data null                  else                      Console.WriteLinedata.incidentList.Count.ToString   rows of incident data.                  Console.WriteLinenPress any key to continue...         Console.ReadLine         codepre  pWhen the code runs, it ALWAYS tells me that there were zero rows and the debugger shows me that an empty array returns.  I have traced into the messages being exchanged with the WCF trace tools by activating logging, and I can see my data coming back 100 elements in the array.p  pThe tricky part is that the serializer just silently throws the data away  and that is causing me to wonder if I should just abandon the WCF clientBase based proxy and use raw HTTP get, and a separate JSON parser to deal with the data.  p

Negative 2395 pI was wondering if there is an accepted solution in the case where I want to write an app a blog, for example and I would like for there to be only one user. Ive been looking around SO without much luck mostly running into questions about one User model.p  pI think using devise or sorcery would be a bit overkill if I would be creating a User model  table just to store one user.

Negative 2395 pConnecting to DB2 from my Scalaapp on top of Jetty work fine 12 seconds when I run the app in console,by starting jetty manually java jar start.jar. However, when I start Jetty as a service, the connection takes 3060 seconds to establish.p  pThis is something I have spent few days trying to solve.p  pFirst I thought it is something to do with the iSeries Access ODBC Driver, which is used. I have another app written with Javascript, running on top of Node.js, which seems to work ok with this connection. I also played with most of the options this driver provides, but they didnt seem to help. Then I thought the problem has to be with th JDBC, and I tried to use com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Jcc, but this didnt seem to fix the problem.p  pI put a logger to inspect what happens with the connection, but this didnt bring any extra help. Both connections seems similar, except when run as service it takes at least ten times longer to establish connection.p  pI thought that the issue could be if DB2driver tries to authenticate against Activer directory, which is in use, so I created a local user foobar. I set the iSeries to use this user ID as default. This didnt help either. I also tried to run the service with my username, which didnt help.p  pIm currently out of ideas.

Ive tried adding a delay to the animation function as you can see above and also a setTimeout in the for loop, but no luck. Any help would be great. p
Negative 2395 pIm working on a Rails app that allows you to upload large music files. Id like to upload these in the background so that when you start an upload it gets moved to a sidekiq worker while the user enters meta data about the file such as the track name and artist, etc. p  pI was able to follow this railscast to get image processing moved to the background a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes383uploadingtoamazons3viewasciicast relnofollowhttprailscasts.comepisodes383uploadingtoamazons3viewasciicastap  pBut I cant quite figure out how to move the actual upload of the file to the background. Is there a certain callback or Sidekiq method I should usep  pAre there any resources on how to do something like this p  pHeres my song model a hrefhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001583 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001583ap  pMy songs controller a hrefhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001590 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001590ap  pMy upload form a hrefhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001586 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001586ap  pMy uploader using carrierwave with carrierwavedirect to s3 a hrefhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001601 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comleemcalilly5001601ap  pThat code works to upload to s3, but the browser is tied up in a Rails process while the file is uploading. Id prefer to move that to a background process. The sidekiq code there I think is really from the Railscast that handles image processing, but I dont quite understand why the image processing is working in that Railscast.p  pAny help getting pointed in the right direction is much appreciated.p

Negative 2395 pFirstly, I know these subjects have been created a lot of time on stackoverflow, but I dont have found the solution to my problems. Secondly, Im french, so my english is not perfect, sorry per advance and tell me if you dont understand something. And to finish this introduction, its the first time that Im dealing with fragments, so, sorry if there is something that I dont have well understand p  pI have three buttons, that allow to switch between three fragments. Inside one of these fragments, I have a view pager with two fragments. For the moment, each fragments there are 5, only contains a TextView.

I was able to fix that by creating a new fragment on onButtonSelected method, but I dont want to recreate fragment each time, for memory reasons and for functional reasons  fragment have to keep her state. This problem is not my main problem, indeed, i know that to disable the button when user is already on fragment is possible, but its strange to have an exception when this management is not done, no .pli lipWhen I go out from the fragment with the view pager, and I go back to this fragment, I have an IllegalStateException Recursive entry to executePendingTransactions.

Negative 2395 pI currently handle timing out from a PHP web application as suchp  ul liEach page currently has a timeout check in PHP, which checks the current time against the last page load by the user.

The popup would then have options to either continue the session make an AJAX call to refresh the lastactivity in the session or to log out. If the popup is ignored if the user is on a different page, for example, the user is logged out.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3252743usingjavascripttooverrideordisablemetarefreshtagUsing Javascript to override or disable meta refresh taga, I wont be able to reset the codeltmetagtcode tag, which will likely mean that Ill have to remove the tag. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11538803phpjavascriptsessiontimeoutwithwarningPHPJavascript Session Timeout with warningas sole answer suggests to use a JavaScript call redirect to the login page, however this can be circumvented by disabling JavaScript. p  pWhat Im thinking about doing is surrounding the codeltmetagtcode redirect tag with codeltnoscriptgtcode allowable since Im using HTML5, so that even if the user doesnt use JavaScript, they will still be timed out.

Negative 2395 pemDisclaimer  I apologize for the verbosity of this question I think its an interesting problem, though, yet I cannot figure out how to more concisely word it.emp  pI have done hours of research as to the apparently myriad of ways in which to solve the problem of accessing multiGB files in a 32bit process on 64bit Windows 7, ranging from codeLARGEADDRESSAWAREcode to codeVirtualAllocExcode AWE.  I am somewhat comfortable in writing a multiview memorymapped system in Windows CreateFileMapping, MapViewOfFile, etc., yet cant quite escape the feeling that there is a more elegant solution to this problem.  Also, Im quite aware of Boosts interprocess and iostream templates, although they appear to be rather lightweight, requiring a similar amount of effort to writing a system utilizing only Windows API calls not to mention the fact that I already have a memorymapped architecture semiimplemented using Windows API calls.p  pIm attempting to process large datasets.  The program depends on precompiled 32bit libraries, which is why, for the moment, the program itself is also running in a 32bit process, even though the system is 64bit, with a 64bit OS.  I know there are ways in which I could add wrapper libraries around this, yet, seeing as its part of a larger codebase, it would indeed be a bit of an undertaking.  I set the binary headers to allow for codeLARGEADDRESSAWAREcode at the expense of decreasing my kernel space, such that I get up to around 23 GB of addressable memory per process, give or take depending on heap fragmentation, etc..p  pHeres the issue  the datasets are 4GB, and have DSP algorithms run upon them that require essentially random access across the file.  A pointer to the object generated from the file is handled in C, yet the file itself is loaded into memory with this partial memorymapped system in C its PInvoked.  Thus, I believe the solution is unfortunately not as simple as simply adjusting the windowing to access the portion of the file I need to access, as essentially I want to still have the entire file abstracted into a single pointer, from which I can call methods to access data almost anywhere in the file.p  pApparently, most memory mapped architectures rely upon splitting the singular process into multiple processes.. so, for example, Id access a 6 GB file with 3x processes, each holding a 2 GB window to the file.  I would then need to add a significant amount of logic to pull and recombine data from across these different windowsprocesses.  codeVirtualAllocExcode apparently provides a method of increasing the virtual address space, but Im still not entirely sure if this is the best way of going about it.p  pBut, lets say I want this program to function just as easily as a singular 64bit proccess on a 64bit system.  Assume that I dont care about thrashing, I just want to be able to manipulate a large file on the system, even if only, say, 500 MB were loaded into physical RAM at any one time.  Is there any way to obtain this functionality without having to write a somewhat ridiculous, manual memory system by hand  Or, is there some better way than what I have found through thusfar combing SO and the internetp  pThis lends itself to a secondary question  is there a way of limiting how much physical RAM would be used by this process  For example, what if I wanted to limit the process to only having 500 MB loaded into physical RAM at any one time whilst keeping the multiGB file paged on diskp  pIm sorry for the long question, but I feel as though its a decent summary of what appear to be many questions with only partial answers that Ive found on SO and the net at large.  Im hoping that this can be an area wherein a definitive answer or at least some proscons can be fleshed out, and we can all learn something valuable in the processp

Negative 2395 pWhats the ideal way to load textures Im writing a simple RTS game. I have a 2d array that represents the game area. Lets say each array index should be grass. Then Id do like thisp  precodearray[0]  new Grassx, y array[1]  new Grassx, y ...   Constructor for grass public Grassint x, int y      loadTexturegrass.png  codepre  pFrom the code above you will realize that the grass texture is being loaded twice, which is pretty stupid. How should I tackle this problem How should I structure my project to avoid thisp

Negative 2395 pI just started to implement the librocket an UI lib that generates mesh from HTML one requirement is the codeRenderInterfacecode. The lib basically sends your class that inherits from codeRenderInterfacecode the generated mesh and wants you to save the mesh then it wants you to render this generated mesh. Sounds good since you have the chance to implement your own render system for an 3rd party lib. However my problem has probably nothing to do with the lib.p  pAs I told the lib sends mesh to my classp  precodeGLuint mBufferID[2] ... glGenBuffers2, mBufferID .. glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, mBufferID[0] glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, size, data, GLSTATICDRAW glBindBufferGLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, mBufferID[1] glBufferDataGLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, size, data, GLSTATICDRAW codepre  pThats basically happen when the Lib sends me mesh. Actually it also loads a texture etc. but this is not important at the moment. NOTE data is an pointer to an array of ROCKETLIBVertexp  precodeglEnableVertexAttribArray0 glVertexAttribPointer0, 2, GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, sizeofROCKETCOREVertex, GLvoidoffsetofRocketCoreVertex, position  glEnableVertexAttribArray1 glVertexAttribPointer1, 4, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, GLTRUE, sizeofROCKETCOREVertex, GLvoidoffsetofRocketCoreVertex, colour glEnableVertexAttribArray2 glVertexAttribPointer2, 2, GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, sizeofROCKETCOREVertex, GLvoidoffsetofRocketCoreVertex, texcoord   glUniformMatrix4fv0, 1, GLFALSE, ampmTransMatrix[0][0]  glUniform2f1, translation.x, translation.y  glActiveTextureGLTEXTURE0  glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, mBufferID[0] glBindBufferGLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, mBufferID[1]  glDrawElementsGLTRIANGLES, mindicescount, GLUNSIGNEDINT, NULL  glDisableVertexAttribArray0 glDisableVertexAttribArray1 glDisableVertexAttribArray2 codepre  pAfter the mesh is uploaded to the GPU I render it with upper code.

Negative 2395 pI came across this complication when loading content through ajax. I usually use window.load to check if everything is loaded up and only than I display content, there is loading animation before.p  pthis is done to hide bits from user that are styled via javascript and without hiding them page looks ugly for a split second. It stopped working after I started loading content via ajax, and it than turned out that you cant use window.load with it.p  pI tried looking for replacement method, but had no luck. Has anyone had luck with this and found similar solution that works with ajaxp

Negative 2395 pGreeting all,p  pI am at a point deciding which bit version to go for and am keen to hear your advice on this.p  pWe have been running our build automation on a Windows 2003 32bit server with NAnt and CruiseControl.NET, and others including Visual Studio and relevant toolsets. As we are now looking into building for web applications which require IIS7, I consider to set up a new build environment in Windows Server 2008 R2 64bit.p  pHowever when I test run build automation on my Windows 7 64bit machine, I bum in many glitches relating programfile, e.g. checked out projects look for MS SDKsBootstrapperEngine under the wrong programfile. I googled for solution and some of them require changes to project file  which I am not sure if appropriate as it likely affects how other developers build project on their dev environment.p  pSo now I am thinking maybe I should have Windows Server 2008 32bits instead as I am not sure how many more of these compatibility issues Id bum in  they can be quite a time waster. Is my suspicion on this correct Should I stay with 32bit to be safe for a easier setup Would it be sustainable having a 32bit CI server p  pMuch appreciated if you can comment on this and let me know your experience regarding an OS upgrade on a CI server.p

Negative 2395 pIm not expert in Component Object Model COM, but from what I understand it works something like this Program A a server program exposes COM interface lets say via TLB file. A client program uses this interface and call its functions and all the underlying stuff is done for you free of charge. So in this case when the Server program is running and Client program communicates with the Server using COM object. Each one of the programs processes has it own address space.  Now with MSXML it is a bit different. From what I understand, msxmlX.dll is a COM dll, but lets say when I implicitly link against it using msxmlX.h and msxmlX.lib during run time its being loaded to the same memory space as my executable.

Negative 2395 pI have class Button, that is a subclass of CCNode. Since a button as in computer buttons, ISNOT a CCLabelBMFont or CCSprite, I subclassed it as a CCNode. In addition, I have extended CCLabelBMFont with child CCLabelCustom that has some fancy logic of its own. With that, I have moved CCLabelCustom buttonLabel and CCSprite buttonSprite as an iVar of Button. I want Button to be as abstract as possible, with no default buttonLabel or buttonSprite. The thing is, how do I go initing both CCLabelCustom and CCSprite The CCLabelCustom have some long inits with more than four parameter and additional properties can be assigned. p  precode Rough Idea to help elaborate my classes interface Button  CCNode  property nonatomic, strong CCLabelCustom buttonLabel property nonatomic, strong CCSprite buttonSprite  end    Rough Idea to help elaborate my classes interface CCLabelCustom  CCLabelBMFont  property nonatomic, strong SomeProperty someVar property nonatomic, strong AnotherProperty anotherVar  voidfancyMethod voidinitWithSomethingSomethingsomething andAnotherAnotheranother alongWithFunfun  end codepre  pIs there any architecture that I dont know of Is there any method that I can init Button with the two iVar from outside the class I dont want any default value that I can define inside the Button class.

Negative 2395 pI created a Maven Archetype for use in our company projects. Everything worked well until going to deploy a project built from the archetype which failed due to invalid XML.p  pWithin the template I created to generate the archetype from are several .xml files. Each has an XML declaration ofp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt codepre  pWhen running codemvn archetypecreatefromprojectcode to stamp out the archetype for me, it apparently determined emversionem in the XML declaration as a Maven keyword and wrapped it in a variable. The result was that each XML declaration in the archetype becamep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt codepre  pAfter using the archetype to create a project, Maven obviously replaced this variable with the userchosen version for the project. This resulted in something likep  precodeltxml 1.0SNAPSHOT1.0 encodingUTF8gt codepre  pDefinitely invalid for XML. My question then is, how can you prevent codemvn archetypecreatefromprojectcode from doing this Is there a way to limit its scope in some way or set a flag in the command linep

Negative 2395 pFirst of all, a rough description of my app is a emMagazine Library appem for a particular organisation. p  ol liI have a customized UICollectionViewCell done up with a storyboard prototype. In the prototype are 3 views  strongUIImageViewstrong, strongUILabelstrong, strongUILabelstrong.li lipAdditionally in emcodecollectionViewcellForItemAtIndexPathcodeem, I have created an instance of ap  ul listrongUIButtonstrong emactionselectordownloadButtonTappedemli ul  pand ap  ul listrongUIProgressViewstrong where its emcodetagindexPath.itemcodeem and emcodehiddenYEScodeem. I then add the UIProgressView to an array  strongemself.progressViewArrayemstrong at the strongsame indexstrong as the cells emindexPath.itemem.li ulli lipEach time the Download button for a particular cell is tapped and emcodedownloadButtonTappedcodeem is called, I get the strongcellstrong and strongindexPathstrong of the emsenderems superviews superview which is the strongcellstrong. I then check if code[self.progressViewArray[indexPath.item] tag]  indexPath.itemcode. If the condition is fulfilled, then strongcode[self.progressViewArray[indexPath.item] setHiddenNO]codestrong is executed.pli ol  pI have a datasource of 22 objects, thus, I have 22 cells. Everything works like how I want it to so far. Even when I scroll the cell off view dequeued and back in view recycled, the UIProgressView still remains.p  h1Problemh1  pThe progressView is also reappearing at other cells E.g. if I tapped the Download button for cell 3, the UIProgressView correctly shows in that cell HOWEVER, strongcells 10 and 19 are also showing the duplicated UIProgressViewstrong. This problem also applies when to other cells. E.g. when I tap Download for cell 20, I scroll up and I see cells 12 and 4 with the same loading UIProgressViews too as if those magazines were being downloaded too.p  pWhy I mentioned strongsamestrong is because I have a codesetDownloadProgressBlockcode that updates the progress of the UIProgressViews and the progress of cells 3, 10, and 19 UIProgressViews are progressing together.p  pI really hope that I can find some help here as Ive been killing my brains for many days over this issue.p  pstrongP.S.

Negative 2395 pI am making a game using Lua and I need to use Breadthfirst search to implement a fast pathfinding algorithm which finds the shortest path between the enemy AI and the player. p  pI will have up to 3 enemies using this algorithm at once and map is a 2dimensional tilebased maze. I have already implemented collision detection so now all that is left to do is get a way for the enemies to find the shortest path to the player in a way that can be done quickly and and preferably about 8090 times per second per enemy.p  pWhen I previously implemented breadthfirst search, I used a queue in C. From what I have read about Lua, stack implementations using tables are very efficient since the elements dont need to be shifted after codepushcode AKA table.insert and codepopcode table.remove operations. However, I have theorized that queues with large sizes can be very inefficient in Lua, because if you want to insertremove something from index 1 of a table, all other elements in the table must be shifted either upward or downward in the table.p  pThus, I would like to ask some simple questions for those experienced in Lua. What is the simplest andor fastest implementation of a queue in this language Is it even possible to have a fast queue in Lua or is it just generally accepted that Lua will always be forced to shift all elements for a queue operation such as codepopcode or codeappendcode p  pEDIT I understand that the underlying implementation of shifting elements in Lua tables is written in C and is therefore quite optimized. I just would like to know if I have any better options for queues before I begin to write a simple table implementation.p

Negative 2395 pI am guessing this is more of a groovy issue due to the geb implementation, but Im wondering if there is any way to get intellisense to work with the geb page objects.  I am also new to JavaGroovy primarily C development in the past so there could be some things Im just not quite understanding.  Im using Intellij, but Id be happy if there is any IDE that could give me what I wanted.  p  pAs far as I can tell, Gebs implementation is that they have a Browser Class with a Page property and any methods or properties that are executed without the context of a specific Page instance will at runtime trigger a MissingMethod or MissingProperty exception, which Geb handles and reroutes to a corresponding method or property in the Page class that is currently set via the Page property in the Browser Class.p  pWhat this means for development is that when were creating test cases, the IDE is unaware of which page instance is the current Browser Page property, thus no intellisense.p  pWe experimented with creating instances of the pages and explicitly calling them, and also making our helper functions within the page classes static, both of which led to other issues.p  pFor our shop, this is pretty much a deal breaker, but before we give up I wanted to see if any Geb or Groovy experts could offer some advice on how to get intellisense working, or could give us an indication of whether it is even possible.p  pEDIT I found within the geb documentation a section on Strong Typing and IDE support that looked promising a hrefhttpwww.gebish.orgmanualcurrentideandtyping.htmlidesupport relnofollowhttpwww.gebish.orgmanualcurrentideandtyping.htmlidesupporta however, the examples provided fail.

Negative 2395 pHi Im trying to create a horizontal menu bar for a website that will have sub menus beneath it and that is justified at least the top level items. p  pThe idea is that when on the home page the top level items are visible, when hovering over the top level items I would like the item to change colour and the sub menus to become visible, then when hovering over the sub menu these should change colour. This all seems to work fine.p  pWhat Im struggling with is once I click on the top level item and I am taken to that page I need the sub menu for that item to stay visible until I hover over any of the other top level items as the overlap in the space Ive got. The only way i can think to achieve this is to use jQuery to hide the active sub menu when hovering over the other top level items but the problem with this is even when hovering over the active selection the sub menu becomes hidden.p  pIve tried to achieve what Im after with just css but Im starting to think its not possible, which is why Im now looking at the jQuery option, but now Im stuck here too Ive possibly massively overcomplicated things.p  pIve made a fiddle to help try to explain what Im on aboutp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvLZv7 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netvLZv7ap  pThis is as though you have selected the first top level item and you are now on parent1.html p  pAny help or guidance would be really appreciated.p  pMy codep  precodeltdiv classmenugt ltulgt     ltli classactivegtlta hrefgtParent 1ltagt     ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 11ltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 12ltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 13ltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltligt     ltligtlta hrefwhatwedo.phpgtParent 2ltagt     ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 21ltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 22ltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 23ltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtParent 3ltagt     ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 31ltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefgtSub 31ltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltligt ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode.menu ul     textalignjustify     width300px     minwidth500px     margintop60px  .menu ulafter     content     displayinlineblock     width100  .menu ul li     displayinlineblock     liststylenone     whitespacenowrap     margin0     padding0  .menu ul li a     textdecorationnone     color000  .menu ul lihover a     colorCCCC00     borderbottom1px solid CCCC00  .menu ul li ul     displaynone   .menu ul lihover ul     positionabsolute     displayblock     textalignjustify     width500px     minwidth500px     margin0     paddingtop20px  .menu ul lihover ul li a     color000     bordernone     marginright25px  .menu ul lihover ul lihover a     colorCCCC00  .menu li.active a     colorCCCC00     borderbottom1px solid CCCC00  .menu li.active ul     positionabsolute     displayblock     textalignjustify     width500px     minwidth500px     margin0     paddingtop20px  .menu li.active ul li a     color000     marginright25px     borderbottomnone  .menu li.active ul lihover a     colorCCCC00     marginright25px  .hide     displaynone  codepre  pSimple jQueryp  precode.menu.hover function .menu li.active ul li a.addClasshide , function .menu li.active ul li a.removeClasshide   codepre

Negative 2395 pMy MacOS Cocoa application displays a window of static text, meaning it should not be changed by the user, should not be first responder, etcetera. The only thing that happens to the text is that each word of it changes color from idleColor to highlightColor, and then back again at a specific point in time. It is similar to a Karaoke display  individual words change color, and then change back, under program control, based on a list of timed events.p  pAll of this works beautifully under MacOS 10.7 and 10.8. BUT, under 10.9, the text color does NOT change UNLESS I click in the window and continually move the cursor around, so I am manually highlighting and unhighlighting some of the text, continuously. If I do this, the regular words behave as intended. Essentially, it feels like the OS is refusing to update the window under program control, unless I am forcing it to update by manually performing something that requires the UI to respond.p  pThe code that performs the color changes is as followsp  precodeif sEvent.attribute  HIGHLIGHTON      [sTextView setTextColorhighlightColor range currentRange]     textIsLitUp  YES      else      [sTextView setTextColoridleColor range currentRange]     textIsLitUp  NO      [sTextView setNeedsDisplayYES] codepre  psTextView is a subclass of NSTextView.p  pNow, if I comment out that last line, then I get the same, incorrect behavior under 10.7 and 10.8. In other words, under 10.9, the setNeedsDisplay method is not working, or not working the same way.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas about working around this, or have any other light to shed on the problem Or am I doing something terribly wrong It is CRITICAL to the application that the changes to the textColor happen without latencyp  pEDITING MY QUESTION  to answer itp  pFound the answer elsewhere here I needed to call setNeedsDisplay on the main thread  it was in a secondary thread.

Negative 2395 pSorry but Ive been working on this problem for the past few hours. Im using the MLPAutocomplete Class for the autocomplete text field in my application. I have no problems implementing the library. For my case, however, I have four text fields and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comEddyBorjaMLPAutoCompleteTextField relnofollowimplementation that was described in the gitHuba does not describe how to implement the library with multiple text fields. So in order to supply the correct array of strings to the text field that is currently in use was to check which of the four text fields is highlighted. Here is the function that provides the array for the autocomplete text field.p  pWhat I basically do is that in my codeviewDidLoadcode method, I initialize the four arrays for the four textviews and in the function below, codepossiblecompleteionsForStringcode, what I do is I take Boolean values based on whether or not a text field is highlighted. Based on this, I then assign the proper array to the completions array completions array is the one shown in the textfield. However, I noticed that this does not work 100 of the time. There are cases wherein my app shows a different array. For example, I have set a text for my codebrandInputcode textfield and I try to input for the codepartInputcode textField, what happens is that the log shows the followingp  precode20140228 165751.295 Database[73523f03] brand input Status active 20140228 165752.154 Database[73523f03] brand input Status active 20140228 165757.463 Database[73523f03] part input Status active  20140228 165757.465 Database[73523f03] brand input Status active codepre  pIt managed to detect that the brandInput codetextFieldcode was active, then it also saw that I switched over to the codepartInputcode textField. However, for an unknown reason, it still went to codebrandInputcode as the active one, giving me a wrong array. p  pHere is the code.p  precode voidautoCompleteTextFieldMLPAutoCompleteTextField textField  possibleCompletionsForStringNSString string             completionHandlervoid NSArray handler     dispatchqueuet queue  dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH, 0     dispatchasyncqueue,           NSMutableArray completions  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]         [completions removeAllObjects]          BOOL partInputStatus  partInput.highlighted         BOOL brandInputStatus  brandInput.highlighted         BOOL barcodeInputStatus  barcodeInput.highlighted         BOOL itemNameInputStatus  itemNameInput.highlighted          ifpartInputStatus             NSLogpart input Status active             completions  [self part]                   ifbrandInputStatus             NSLogbrand input Status active             completions  [self brand]                   ifbarcodeInputStatus             NSLogbarcode input Status active             completions  [self barcode]                   ifitemNameInputStatus             NSLogitemname input Status active             completions  [self itemName]                   handlercompletions       codepre  pHow do I do this I dont think marking codebrandcode as inactive wont work because the codeBooleancode variables get reinitialized at the start of the function.p  pIs there any other way to detect which textField is active I have seen some solutions, however, those are the delegate functions and I dont think I can call them from my function. p  pAny help is very much appreciated.

Negative 2395 pI am writing a class which has three priority queues as private members.p  precodeclass Foo  ... ...  private    I am fine with using pointers instead if it helps.   stdpriorityqueueltintgt first    min heap.   stdpriorityqueueltintgt second   max heap.   stdpriorityqueueltintgt third   min heap.  codepre  pNow I require codefirstcode and codethirdcode to start as codemin heapscode and codesecondcode as a codemax heapcode. As part of the functionality of my class I need to do the followingp  ol liMove codesecondcode to codefirstcode. Ideally this is achieved through lowest amount of copying. The underlying vector should just be moved. Additionally codefirstcode should now behave like a codemax heapcode.li liMove codethirdcode to codesecondcode. This means codesecondcode should now behave like a codemin heapcode.li liSince codethirdcodes contents have been moved to codesecondcode, it should be empty. I would like to either allocate a new underlying vector or reuse codefirstscode underlying vector it doesnt need it any more. Additionally third should now be a codemax heapcode.li ol  pI need to perform this cycle max  min and min  max an unknown number of times.p  pI am struggling to do this with codestdpriorityqueuecode since the Comparator is a template argument which means I cannot change it at run time. This is preventing me from turning a codemin heapcode into a codemax heapcode.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs there a way I could possibly bend codestdpriorityqueuecode to do my bidding without making it extremely uglyli liIf not then could I perhaps restructure my class to do the same thing, but still use codestdpriorityqueuecodeli liOtherwise could I maybe reuse most of the codeheapifycode logic in the std library to achieve thisli ol

Negative 2395 pI created a Setup Project copied all my files over to the application folder, included an accessdbengine.exe file and created a Custom Install Action using the accessdbengine.exe file with the argument set to passivep  pWhen I run the setup it shows that it installs the accessdbengine.exe but it doesnt look like the regular installer when manually running the accessdbengine.exe, it also doesnt show up in programs like it does when manually installing it.p  pMy app doesnt work unless the accessdbengine.exe is installed, if I manually install it then it works.

Negative 2395 pI am using SubsamplingScaleImageView by Dave Morrissey a hrefhttpsgithub.comdavemorrisseysubsamplingscaleimageview relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdavemorrisseysubsamplingscaleimageviewa to allow users to crop and pan a photo with gestures. p  pI modified the library to add a tint and a logo to the photo. Now I need to upload the photo to the server. In order to do that I need to somehow extract the photo from the SubsamplingScaleImageView.p  pI added the following method to the SubsamplingScaleImageView classp  blockquote precode   Capture a photo of the image view   public Bitmap getOutput      buildDrawingCache     Bitmap b1  getDrawingCache     Bitmap b  b1.copyConfig.ARGB8888, true     destroyDrawingCache     return b  codepre blockquote  pI am using this method to get the file, resize it to a specific resolution 800x800, and save it to my apps folder.p  pThe problem I noticed is that the extracted photo from the drawing cache depends on the resolution of the device. For example, on my Full HD device I get 1080x1080 photo, which is enough, but on some lower res devices I get resolutions like 480x480 and that is not enough since the image needs to be bigger than that, so the photo gets blurry when I resize it to 800x800. p  pIs there a way to get the same resolution photo from that image view on all devicesp

Negative 2395 pI dont know if the question is stupid or not, locking and the Monitor is kind a black box to me. p  pBut Im dealing with a situation where I can either use the same lock object to lock everything all the time or use a indefinite number of object to lock at a more fine grain level.p  pI know that the second way will reduce the lock contention, but I may end up using 10K objects as locks and I dont know if it has an impact or not.p  pBottom line does too many locks hurt locking or it has no impactp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI wrote a lib that maintain a graph of objects, the number could be very high. For now its not thread safe, mainly for the reason Eric stated in his comment. p  pI initially thought that if the user wanted to do some multithreading then heshe would have to take care of the locking. p  pBut now Im wondering that if I would have to make it threadsafe, what would be the best way to do it note that making it threadsafe wouldnt be a short and easy ride for me so testing both solutions is something I cant do easilyp  pAs the purpose is to make each object of the graph threadsafe, then I could use the instance of the object for the lock when I want to accessmodify its properties. I know its the best way to reduce contention, but I dont know if it would scale as much as having only one lock for the whole graph.p  pI know theres a lot to consider, how many threads and especially I think the chance of an object being accessedchanged by multiple threads at a time which I estimate to be pretty low. But I cant find accurate information about locks and their overhead in such case.p

Negative 2395 pi have a WPF application which downloads file using a MultiThreaded approach and it consumes nearly 100 of my bandwidthand this is what I require but when i move the code from this WPF application to my main WPF application which has many other utilities inside it then my bandwidth consumption reduces to nearly 25 or less. After examining my project i realized that the application starts all the thread and then some of the threads goes to sleep or wait and only 2,3 thread works on the downloading and then when they finish their work the other 2,3 threads woke up. I dont understand why this is happening as it was working fine in my other WPF Application. I am using GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Messaging.Messenger for message passing so that i could invoke the downloader or uploader to start their work. I have tried threadpool, System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.Invoke but all of them gives the same result they work good in standalone WPF application but not in the main Application.p  pUpdatep  pwhat i come to know is that when i start my application and let it run for some time without doing anything for a min or two. then the application starts performing better and gives the same result as standalone application did.p

I mean, the matrices were wrong, I think, because OpenGL didnt show anything. So I tryed doing the opposite, I created the matrices in OpenGL and used them with my code. The result is better, but not perfect yet.p  pNow I think the I do something wrong mapping the 3D points into 2D screen points because the points I get are inverted in Y and I still have some lines not perfectly matching.p  pThis is what I get using the OpenGL matrices and my previous approach to map 3D points to 2D screen space this is the SVG, not OpenGL renderp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsxbm5.jpg altenter image description herep  hr  pOk this is the content of the view matrix I get from OpenGLp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combQvmI.jpg altenter image description herep  pThis is the projection matrix I get from OpenGLp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comINsGa.jpg altenter image description herep  pAnd this is the result I get with those matrices and by changing my 2D point Y coordinate calculation like bofjas saidp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiH1j6.jpg altenter image description herep  pIt looks like some rotations are missing. My camera has a rotation of 30 on both the X and Y axis, and it looks like theyre not computed correctly.p  pNow Im using the same matrices OpenGL does.

Negative 2395 pI have written down a DOM parser in java which reads tags and attributes from 1 xml file, makes some changes to them, and finally writes them down to a new xml file. The problem lies with the readability. In the original xml file, for every tag, each attribute is on a separate line making the xml quite readable and easier to manually make changes. On the other hand, the new xml file that is being filled by my DOM parser has all the attributes of a tag on the same line making the xml very difficult to manually comprehend and make changes to due to the abundance of both tags and their attributes. I was thinking if there is a way to put every attribute of a tag on a separate line through DOM Or do I have to use some other parser which provides this capability p  pCurrent xml file p  precodelttag id1 namea age3 gt codepre  pAnd, I want my xml to look like p  precodelttag     id1     namea     age3 gt codepre

Negative 2395 pI created my game apps in Xcode 5.1.1. Yesterday i downloaded Xcode 6.1. I downloaded 6.1 because i also want to make my app on iPhone 6 and 6. Why is it when i upload the simulator for all iOS 8 devices the simulator loads normally full screen as if i already made adjustments for the phone for its 4.7inch and 5.5 inch when i havent. However, in assistant editor storyboard preview under the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch phones there is a HUGE empty space because i havent yet started fitting my 4 inch game designs for iPhone 6. So since simulator already loads the iPhone 6 design perfectly does it mean i dont have to actually custom build a 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch screen Im confused.p

The first thing that you notice coming from the sklearn world is the diverse syntax across packages. Which is understandable, but kind of inconvenient. caret seems like a nice solution to that problem, creating cohesion across all the different R packages i.e. randomForest, gbm,.... Though Im still puzzled by some of default choices i.e. the train method seems to default to some sort of grid search. Also, caret seems to be using plyr behind the scenes, which messes up some of dplyr methods like summarise. Since I do lots of data manipulation with dplyr thats kind of a problem. Can you help me figure out what the carets equivalent of the sklearns modelfitpredictproba is Also, is there a way to deal with the plyrdplyr issue Lastly, can you suggest some good booksite to learn caretp

I get the error messagep  precodeTypeError scope.uiGrid is undefined in ...angularuigriduigrid.js line 2879 codepre  pThe relevant line in uigrid.js is the first line is 2879p  precodeif angular.isStringscope.uiGrid.data          dataWatchCollectionDereg  scope.parent.watchCollectionscope.uiGrid.data, dataWatchFunction              else          dataWatchCollectionDereg  scope.parent.watchCollectionfunction  return scope.uiGrid.data , dataWatchFunction        codepre  pThe thing is, if I replace the [ui.grid] array in the directive module creation with an empty array, the test passes. The only problem, is that if I do that, Ill have to include ui.grid anywhere the directive is used otherwise the directive stops working, which is something I cannot do.p  pI already tried transcluding, but that didnt seem to help, not to mention that the directive itself works, so it doesnt seem logical to have to do that just for the test.p  pAny thoughts p

Negative 2395 pIm working with a codeTIdHTTPServercode to serve files to clients, using the codeResponseInfogtServeFilecode function. This works fine for files that are static not being written by some other process. As far as I can see from the code, the ServeFile function internally uses a codeTIdReadFileExclusiveStreamcode, which disallows me from reading a file being written, but I need to be able to send also files that are being written by some other process. p  pSo, I moved to create a FileStream myself and use the codeContentStreamcode property to return it to the client, but I get a 0 bytes file in the client for any file, being written or not, and I cant see what Im missing or doing wrong. Here is the code Im using on the codeOnCommandGetcode event handlerp  precodeAResponseInfogtContentStream  new TFileStreampath, fmOpenRead  fmShareDenyNone AResponseInfogtContentStreamgtPosition  0 AResponseInfogtContentLength  AResponseInfogtContentStreamgtSize AResponseInfogtResponseNo  200 AResponseInfogtWriteHeader AResponseInfogtWriteContent codepre  pThe ContentLength property at this point has a valid value i.e., the file size when calling ContentStreamSize, and thats what I would like to send to the client, even if the file changes in between.p  pI have tried removing the WriteContent function, the WriteHeader, but the results are the same. I searched for some examples but the few I found are more or less the same than this code, so I dont know whats wrong. Most examples dont include the WriteContent call, thats why I have tried removing them, but there doesnt seem to be any difference.p  pAs a side note the files being written take 24 hours to finish writing, but thats to be expected from the client side I just need the bytes already written at the time of the request even somewhat less is valid. The files will never get deleted they will just keep getting bigger.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pUsing Fiddler, I get some warnings on protocol violations, that would be related to this. I get, for instancep  pcodeContentLength mismatch Response Header indicated 111,628,288 bytes, but server sent 41 bytescodep  pThe content length is correct, its the file size, but I dont know what Im doing wrong that makes the app sent just 41 bytes. p

I tested and this all works fine when I use a reliable connection, like when Im home.p  pMy question is, will it work when my 3G connection drops and how can I make this system reliable  I want to keep storing the data if the connection is down and send it all when its back online, but i dont know if the system will automatically connect i cant have a person manually clicking connect to hamachi or to the ftp server my first time using this technologies.p  pAlso, is there a better, more reliable or simpler way than hamachiftp to send the datap  pThx,p  pEDIT Adding more info. Im gathering data with a LabView VI.

Negative 2395 pIf you have an image with a black background, with various things on it, how can you parse the individual things outp  pMy wish would be to parse graphics as different regions if they are separated from other regions by at least a pixel of solid background color.  So, in the image below, 10 graphics regions.  The gray area with black dots is considered a single region, so is the pink dot with a white dot inside of it.p  pThen, maybe, text if they are separated further, perhaps by at least 6 pixels.  So, in the image below, 6 text regions.  I realize I may have to separate regions if apart from another region by 1 pixel, recognize text after, and rejoin them.p  pOnce I have the regions separated manually for now Im doing well identifying what they are and OCRing the text.  Just want to be able to automatically detect the regions.p  pOnly thing Ive come up with so far is having a 2D array of booleans for each pixel marking whether each pixel has been parsed.  Then, going through each, and when hitting one that isnt background color, trying to step in each direction until hitting a background color.  Toggling the array of Booleans along the way.  Wondering if theres a better way, or a discussion of doing something like this.  Speed is quite important.p  pPhotoshop sort of has something like this implemented.  If you have a layer with some transparent pixels, controlleftclicking it selects the regions with marching ants.  And, its a tight selection of the regions, not just a rectangle around them.  My image isnt really any different, just with pure black pixels instead of transparent ones.p  pDoesnt really make a difference to me whether background colored pixels wholly contained by nonbackground are considered part of the region or not.p  pstrongWant to start with this...strong img srchttps22.postimg.orgu5gjwzfy9regionsUnparsed.jpg altnon parsedp  pstrong...And basically wind up with thisstrong img srchttps2.postimg.orgvu7ag6qbdregionsParsed.jpg altparsedp

Negative 2395 pIm currently developing a clientserver architecture between a tablet client and a MACPC server.

Negative 2395 pFirst of all I want to note that I posted this same question before and did not found a right answer, so sorry for repeating question.p  pNote that I am required to use recursion here. I am aware that shortest path is usually found using BFS, which is not recursive, but I need to know how can this be done recursively.p  pI am working on a rouge game and one of my monsters behaves like this. In a maze, if monster can reach the player in 15 or less steps, it makes the most optimal move possible. In order to implement this, I wrote a small program mimicking basically what is going to happen in my game. My program works in a way that it is able to check if x amount of moves will get him to destination. The only part I am not sure is how to get the first step, so I can pass that info to my monster move function. Here is the program that I wrote so far.p  pOne of my fellow students suggests to fill the empty space with different values and find the path that way, but I could not understand what he meant.

Negative 2395 pIm using a 48 column grid generated by GridPak to render out 48 1 span columns to illustrate 15 minute chunks of time in a 12 hour period.p  pI want to be able to drag a 15 minute chunk to increase the time duration. Im using jQueryUI resizeable to handle the resize. The problem is I need to detect the number of columns I pass over when I resize the column. That way when the codestopcode event fires I can determine how many columns I need to span and remove them from the list to prevent it from overflowing.p  pIn the snippet below, im using codeelementFromPointcode to determine which element corresponds to the elements position but it just returns the jQueryUI helper element because it is the top most element.p  pIs there a better way to

Negative 2395 pI need to parse numbers and get an spelled output in KZ locale. I would like to use ICU4J, but there is no such a locale. What is the most proper way to extend icu data library and add a new KZ locale I read icu documentation a bit and there is described that data library contains multiple coderescode files, which is binary format. So, one possible way is to create res file for KZ, add it to data library and rebuild the icu4j. This process can be very painful and instead of this approach I would prefer to load KZ data from outside.
