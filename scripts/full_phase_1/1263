Positive 1263 pWere migrating form SQL Server 2005 to 2014 for a pretty large environment. And weve noticed that OPENQUERY behaves differently when interacting with MySQL database when it comes to datetime. Previously, it would translate just fine to DATETIME column. With 2014 I assume started in 2008 or so, it now converts to DATETIME2 with maximum precision. This causes problems when comparing to or inserting into DATETIME columns.p  pIs there a way to specify on a serverlevel or specify default for which type those will translate to Rewriting all of the queries will be quite an undertaking, and Id like to avoid this now, if possible rather rewrite as we edit or introduce new things.p

Negative 1263 pIm getting a compiler error saying that Acme.Business.User is not defined.p  pI have a class library project called Acme.Business that has Acme.Business as the assembly name and root namespace as well. None of the classes use the Namespace keyword, so they all should exist in the namespace Acme.Business.p  pI also have a class library project called Acme.Web that has a project reference to Acme.Business. Again Acme.Web is the project name, assembly name, and root namespace. p  pHeres the weird part. If I add a class to Acme.Web I can type Imports Acme. at the top and see both namespaces appear in intellisense like youd expect, but if I try to do Dim x as New Acme.Business.User then Business doesnt show up in intellisense and I get an error saying Acme.Business.User is not defined.p  pI cant see what Im doing wrong Please help. Thanks.p

Negative 1263 pThe idea of unified authentication behind a single API like PAM is very attractive to me. However, PAM seems to be more oriented toward shell authentication and offer a rather limited set of features from its API and require systemwide configuration from a file.p  pIm looking for something like this for a CGI C language web interface that authenticate users using Radius, or with a Postegresql. At the moment, different code is  used for one or the other. In the future, it would be nice to extend the set of authentication mechanisms to LDAP, windows active directory, mysql etc. but implementing them all by hand would be long and painful. p  pSo libpam still is the winner, but the main problem is that additional information other than just login, name, password or home directory must be recorded. Also, file configuration must be avoided. Preferably, the user should configure everything from the programs own configuration file. Finally, small footprint is important as it is intended for an embedded application and high level languages such as perl, python, php are avoided. p  pHow would you deal with that p

Negative 1263 pMy typical gitsvn workflow isp  precodegit checkout b storyxyz git commit a m work git commit a m more work git checkout master git svn fetch git merge remotestrunk git checkout storyxyz git rebase master sometimes with i git checkout master git merge storyxyz codepre  pAt this point I have my codemastercode and codestoryxyzcode branches pointing to the same commit, one or more commits ahead of coderemotestrunkcode. Everything since coderemotestrunkcode is in one linear history. p  precodelast svn commit [remotestrunk] lt work lt more work [master, storyxyz] codepre  pI then run p  precodegit svn dcommit codepre  pI expected to see the commits between coderemotestrunkcode and codemastercode become Subversion revisions, and end up with a single linear history with coderemotestrunkcode, codemastercode and codestoryxyzcode all pointing to the latest revision, like sop  precodelast svn commit lt work lt more work [master, storyxyz, remotestrunk] codepre  pMy Subversion revisions go in fine, but I end up with a twobranched structure. The common root of the branch is the Subversion HEAD before I committed. Both branches contain the same series of commits, in the sense that they contain the same diffs. The branch codestoryxyzcode is at the head of one branch, coderemotestrunkcode and codemastercode at the otherp  precodelast svn commit lt work lt more work [master, remotestrunk]                                       work lt more work [storyxyz] codepre  pThe git commits that I had before running codegit svn dcommitcode are on the lower branch codestoryxyzcode, with my git commit messages, git user name and email, and git commit timestamps. The commits on the upper branch are new git commits. They use my Subversion username, the timestamp when I ran the codedcommitcode, and the commit messages have the codegitsvnidcode field appended to them.p  pThis is all OK, and I can carry on working. The problem is that I look in codegitkcode and see what looks like an unmerged branch codestoryxyzcode. Its pretty hard to tell the difference between a story branch that I have merged back into codemastercode, and one that I havent. The most obvious way to spot it is the duplicate commit messages. I could delete the codestoryxyzcode branch, but that feels like Im not using git properly and Ive lost some of my history.p  pAm I missing something that would stop codegitsvncode from doing this Or is this just one of the ways that interacting with Subversion dilutes the power and freedom of gitp

Negative 1263 pI need to replicate a sequencecounter across an eight node cluster.  This means that each http request receives the next value in the sequence by calling something like getNextIntAndIncrement, where the sequence state is synchronized across all servers.  To clarify, this must exist at applicationglobal scope, not session.  I know it sounds like an awful idea and will undoubtably lead to bottlenecking but this is the requirement.  p  pMy question is what is the best solution  Ive looked at stateful session beans, but they appear to be designed for only one client.   I considered a database sequence.  Ive also looked at Terracotta clustering they have a sequence demo a hrefhttpwww.terracotta.orgwebdisplayorgsiteReciperecipesequencer relnofollowhttpwww.terracotta.orgwebdisplayorgsiteReciperecipesequencera  However Id like to avoid third party solutions if a J2EE solution exists.

Negative 1263 pWe have been requested to stream a single video 500MB from a web site.  The biggest additional requirement is that access must be forbidden to foreign IP addresses.   Given that high bandwith usage is expected we have turned to Amazon S3 to serve the video as a FLV, but AFAIK Amazon wont let you set up IP filtering based on country lists, and FLV Pseudostreaming is not possible from S3, either.p  pThe solution we have come up with is to create an EC2 instance with a web server, and allow it to serve only c0ertain IP ranges corresponding to our country.  Having this solved, its only a matter of serving a static FLV file, but the main question remainp  pTo store the video, we will be setting up a Elastic Block Storage volume to store the video, and copy it on instance boot to local storage, and then serve it from there.   Reading about serving video content from the Amazon Cloud Ive only found references to serving files directly from S3, and with our scheme we will be serving it from EC2, are there any bandwith issues not present on S3   What is the maximum bandwith an EC2 can deliver  How would we scale it if a single EC2 instance fails to serve the content fast enoughp  pAnd, finally, what would be the advantages of using a streaming media server like Wowza Media Server for EC2  p

Negative 1263 pThis is a problem Ive come across for a couple different projects Im working on. p  pSince the projects are still under stealth development, and the problem itself is of potentially broader interest and agnostic to them, Im going to anonymize it  but FWIW, I work primarily with RubyRails and MySQL.p  h2Scenarioh2  pI want to have a system for document editing thats like a wiki, but has these featuresp  ul lifull VCS type behavior ul limultiple asynchronous usersli lifork amp mergeli liblame amp diffli liversioning, commits, amp rollbacksli lioffline editing on working copies  local repositoriesli liefficient amp robust storage ul licould be in MySQL or an independent repo, but no storing full flat text for each documentli ulli ulli lifilelevel fork, merge, etc abilityli limaximal transparency to users theyre very not hackersli ul  pI dont need decentralized repositories, since all of my apps involve authoritative servers, but nor do I mind having em.p  pUnlike a good wiki, the documents that Im dealing with are frequently redundant with arbitrary minor changes and have fairly complex edit and merge histories. p  h2Existing solutionsh2  pThe first requirement is very capably filled e.g. by GitWikip  ul lia hrefhttpatonie.org200802gitwiki relnofollowwebsiteali lia hrefhttpgithub.comminadgitwiki relnofollowrepoali lia hrefhttpgitwiki.kicksass.org relnofollowlive demoali ul  pUnfortunately, Git and all other VCSs I know of only does repositorylevel forks it doesnt allow for filelevel forks.p  h2What is a filedocument level fork anywayh2  pSuppose that I write a bunch of recommendation letters for a lot of people and have them persistently available. A bit of a contrived example, but bear with me.p  pRealistically, what I have is three levels of changesp  ul lia base recommendation letter template that applies to all of themli lia more specific letter for a particular personli lia fully specific letter for a particular person to a particular jobli ul  pNow suppose that I want to change my contact info, or I have new information about a particular person. Conceptually, this should be as simple asp  ol liedit the base letterli liauto merge that into all letters that inherit from itli ol  h2Transclusionh2  pThis could also be considered as using version control for a more flexible  robust sort of transclusion system  the difference being that unlike this simple example, parts of another document might be copied emwith arbitrary editsem.p  pAnother simplified example might help to explain this transclusion issue.p  pSuppose that our documents are posts on a forum. One common thing it to quote others posts in full.p  pThe quote itself is redundant, and in my use, its useful for me to know who quoted whomwhat, etc.p  pSo in the simple case, what we can do is that when someone quotes another, in their editor appears something like code[quote msg1234 v1]Whats the best recipe for mince pie[quote] My mom always used to...codep  pIn most cases, the user will just leave it alone and add their answers below. We can then do a simple transclusion, drop the redundant text, and replace it with a pointer to the quoted message  with the benefit of being able to display UI to indicate that the quoted text has been edited since it was quoted, and to easily see either version.p  pOne step more complex, the user will edit it to be an excerpt, e.g. code[quote msg1234 v1]mince pie[quote] Parsnipcode. Again we can do just a pointer, this time adding an offset and length for transclusion, and UI to expand the excerpt.p  pHowever, our transclusion breaks if the user does something like code[quote msg1234 v1]Whats the best recipe for stupid pie[quote] Fixed lolcode. We can handle this by including the entire fixed text in less stupid cases, this might be e.g. a helpful summarization or rephrasing along with our pointer. UI can switch to the uncorrected version, auto highlight the diff, p  pUnfortunately, just storing the new text  rather than handling it as a real revision  means that we abandon the whole revisioncontrol thing, and in larger documents e.g. a program, book chapter, etc, this is insufficient.p  h2More complexityh2  pA more complex scenario could include, for instancep  ul lidevelopment branches of some particular document and thereby its dependents being edited  and versioned  in parallel with the production branchli licomplex forkmerge histories e.g. a child document is edited, expanded at length, and then partially remerged into its parent and siblings to the extent that its relevant to themli linonhierarchical document relationships e.g. you fork my recommendation letter template and make your own tweaks I then merge back some of your tweaks into mine in the meantime, someone else has forked mine again...li lietc.li ul  pI am primarily dealing with real text documents, but I think this can be considered to apply equally to code.p  h2The questionsh2  ul liDoes anything already do this, or similarli liWhat would be a good way to design such a systemli liWhat components would be good candidates to use like git and sinatra are used in gitwikili liIs there something Im overlookingli ul

It might range from a few seconds to several minutes. p  pI feel that 10 seconds is too short.

Negative 1263 pWe are attempting to connect to an Exchange server through CFEXCHANGECONNECTION on ColdFusion 9 to retrieve email.p  pWe can connect with a number of users.  However, some users cannot connect.  We end up with the following errorp  precodeCannot access Exchange server as a web application at ltservergt codepre  pIt turns out that the users who cannot connect either have a ampersand in there username or they have changed there username with CFLDAP.p  pSo, if I perform a CFLDAP on a working user and change the userPrincipalName and sAMAccountName the user will begin getting the error above.p  pIf I change it back to what it was to start with, the error will go away.p  pAny ideasp  pBEDITBp  pThe ampersand part seems to be misleading.

Negative 1263 pIm new to Spring MVC and trying out a simple project.It will contain a simple adding, viewing, updating and deleting user work flows. It will have login page and once authenticated the user will be taken to a welcome screen which will have links to add, view, update and delete users. Clicking on any of the links will take to individual pages where the user can do the specific tasks. What Im doing here is, Im using a MultiActionController to group together all requests related to User work flow. So the request from Add User link will handled by the addUser method in the UserController which will redirect the user to the Add User page, and the user can then fill in the details and save the new user. Now here is where Im getting confused. Where should I put the save process of the new user, should I put that in new method inside UserController, or use the same addUser method. What is the best way to handle this kind of scenario. p  pI hope I was able to clear my question.p

Negative 1263 pI built an inventory database where ISBN numbers are the primary keys for the items. This worked great for a while as the items were books. Now I want to add nonbooks. some of the nonbooks have EANs or ISSNs, some do not.p  pIts in PostgreSQL with django apps for the frontend and JSON api, plus a few supporting python commandline tools for management. the items in question are mostly books and artist prints, some of which are selfpublished.p  pWhat is nice about using ISBNs as primary keys is that in on top of relational integrity, you get lots of handy utilities for validating ISBNs, automatically looking up missing or additional information on the book items, etcetera, many of which Ive taken advantage. some such tools are offtheshelf PyISBN, PyAWS etc and some are handrolled  I tried to keep all of these parts nice and decoupled, but you know how things can get.p  pI couldnt find anything online about private ISBNs or selfassigned ISBNs but thats the sort of thing I was interested in doing. I doubt thats what Ill settle on, since there is already an apparent run on ISBN numbers.p  pshould I retool everything for EAN numbers, or migrate off ISBNs as primary keys in general if anyone has any experience with working with these systems, Id love to hear about it, your advice is most welcome.p

Negative 1263 pI have created a WiX installation package for a large program.  The install package includes the merge modules for the Visual C 9.0 files.  I need to include the merge modules for a COM DLL.  The installation runs just fine.  The first time I run the program, though, something odd happens.  The first time the COM DLL is called, the Windows install mechanism starts running.  An installation dialog pops up out of the blue.

Negative 1263 pFor a touchscreenenabled application, I would like to modify the standard ScrollViewer controls in my WPF 3.5 application Instead of showing scrollbars, I want the user to scroll by clicking in the control area and dragging the content similar to the behaviour on Apples iPhone. I would like to do that by applying a style to the ScrollViewer, because a I can apply a style automatically to any ScrollViewer in a window even the ones contained in controls like ListView and b I can use the standard Windows Scrollbarstyle if the application is running on a normal desktop with keyboard and mouse.p  pMy first idea was to use a custom control template for the ScrollViewer. The default control template is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa97084728VS.9029.aspx relnofollowdescribed in the MSDNa and uses a ScrollContentPresenter. Normally, I would just derive a class from ScrollContentPresenter and add the slidetoscroll behaviour there, but for some reason, ScrollContentPresenter is sealed  I cant derive from it. Ive tried putting a ScrollContentPresenter into a UserControl, and putting the user control into the ScrollViewer control template, but that didnt work either. p  pIs there a simple way to get this behaviour, without rewriting all the ScollViewerScrollContentPresenter functionalityp

Negative 1263 pIm hoping someone here can help me out, Im not having much luck figuring this out myself. Im running node.js version 0.3.1 on Cygwin. Im using Connect and Socket.io. I seem to be having some random problems with DNS or something, I havent quite figured it out. The end result is that I the server is running fine, but when a browser attempts to connect to it the initial HTTP Request works, Socket.io connects, and then the server dies output below. p  pI dont think it has anything to do with the HTTP request because the server gets a lot data posted to it, and it was receiving requests and responding up until my connection that killed it. Ive googled around and the closest thing Ive found is DNS being set improperly. Its a network program meant to run only on an internal network, so Ive set the codenameserver x.x.x.xcode in my codeetcresolv.confcode to the internal DNS. Ive also added codenameserver 8.8.8.8code in addition.

Negative 1263 pWhat are the differences between shared pointers such as boostsharedptr or the new stdsharedptr and garbage collection methods such as those implemented in Java or C The way I understand it, shared pointers keep track of how many times variables points to the resource and will automatically destruct the resource when the count reaches zero. However, my understanding is that the garbage collector also manages memory resources, but requires additional resources to determine if an object is still being referred to and doesnt necessarily destruct the resource immediately.p  pAm I correct in my assumptions, and are there any other differences between using garbage collectors and shared pointers Also, why would anyone ever used a garbage collector over a shared pointer if they perform similar tasks but with varying performance figuresp

I have come up with two scenarios, none of which are really satisfyingp  ol lipDefine an interface codeILengthChangedcode with the codeLengthChangedcode event, then make sure codeDimensioncode implements codeILengthChangedcode. Then I have to provide one implementation of the codeObservercode method for every interface I define. This by no way generic enough. Id really want to be able to simply pass in a reference to a codeSystem.EventHandlercode event.pli lipUse codeSystem.ActionltSystem.EventHandlergtcode callbacks for registering and unregistering the event handler in the codeObservercode method, just like thatp  pclass Foo      public void ObserverSystem.Action register,                          System.Action unregister              register this.MyEventHandlerp  precode     keep track of the unregister callback, so that we can unregister      our event handler later on, if needed...   private void MyEventHandlerobject sender, System.EventArgs e      ...  codepre  ppli ol  pwhich would then be invoked like thisp  precodeFoo foo  ... Dimension dim  ...  foo.Observer x gt dim.LengthChanged  x, x gt dim.LengthChanged  x codepre  pand which, when executed, will indeed end up wiring the codeLengthChangedcode event with the internal event handler codeMyEventHandlercode. But this is not very elegant. I would have loved to be able to write this insteadp  precodeFoo foo  ... Dimension dim  ...  foo.Observer dim.LengthChanged codepre  pbut Ive no idea how this could be achieved. Maybe I am missing something really obvious here I guess that some codedynamiccode magic could do the trick, somehow, but this would not enforce compiletime type checking I dont want the users of codeObservercode to pass in references to events which do not satisfy the codeSystem.EventHandlercode event signature.p

Windows system updates is another example. I want to know how the user reacted to these alertsnotificationsupdates which are typically a popup window. So i was wondering if i placed a global hook that can monitor the content of the windows displayed on screen and notify meserver when certain words like update, alert, warning etc. appear in the contenttitle of the windows and what the user did with the messagedismissed it, Oked it etc. Unfortunately, i do not have any more specifications than this. I can use anything I want to achieve this and I am not clear on what my choices are. p  pstrongEdit 2strong p  pAfter having reviewed my requirements and having read about hooks, I feel like I could achieve this by a combination of hooks and the following textGrab SDK,  a hrefhttpwww.renovationsoftware.comentextgrabsdktextgrabsdk.html relnofollowhttpwww.renovationsoftware.comentextgrabsdktextgrabsdk.htmla. I want some guidance to know if I am on the right track.

Although this may capture some interesting text, I am still not sure how I will know what action the user had taken on the window. Anybody having any experience with either hooks or textGRAB, please let me know if this looks like a reasonable thing to do.

That said, it appears nothing prevents one from using emPassive Viewem, emSupervising Controllerem, or emPresenter Firstem in a WPF app. Such an approach would result in an application that doesnt really care if the front end is WPF, WinForms, or the Web. It appears that these MVP variants allow more flexibility.p  pHowever, does aiming for UIplatformagnostic flexibility that might not be needed come at the cost of making WPF development much more difficult and lose out on a portion of the featurespower that WPF offers So much so that the costs outweigh the benefitsp  pIn other words, is MVVM so great that one shouldnt consider other alternatives in WPF applicationsp
Negative 1263 pI have a model Album which has a hasmany trough assocation named Track. Basically, an album can have a number of tracks on it, but a track can belong to more than one album at the same time hence the through association Tracklist.p  pI have a RESTful app with a form with the help of formtastic that puts out all the trackss attributes like so p  precodeform.semanticfieldsfor tracks do  builder      builder.fields end codepre  pThe form puts out all the associated Tracks fields and I can update them fine, everything works.p  pNow, what I want to do is have another view to add a new track to an existing album.

Negative 1263 pI have been chewing on this for a while and I thought I would open a question up and try to get some ideas about it. Maybe something will spark a light bulb.p  pI need to build a hex grid and that hex grid will be a minimum 10 x 10 and a maximum 500x500  and possibly bigger. This is obviously a massive grid at the top end and will naturally have to be broken down.p  pHere is the bulk of the problem.p  ul li500x500 grid of hexagons. approx.li liThey do not change very often, but they can change.li liBreaking it down into 50x50 or 100x100 sections is very doable however it is possible that someone could run from one end of the map to the other so I need to be able to deal with the whole thing at some point, even if it is in sections.li liThis will obviously create a big memory drain.li ul  pI can store the data shared vars as simple byteArray or even in plainText. The information per hex is very simple, its just how many there are. I dont have to save the data. would be a featurep  pThe basic structure per hexagon isp  ul lihex color with outline obviously or a bitmap picture blitting anyoneli liTextField with a number in it. max 2 digitsli ul  pThat is pretty much all the info that is needed.p  pIf there wasnt the possibility of the hex changing at all this would be fairly trivial.p  pSo I am curious if anyone has any ideas on this. any absolute truths wouldnt be bad p  pEdit Oh the information on the hexes comes over a tcp stream. This isnt an issue, like I said the data is simplistic per hex and my parser is lightning fast so it isnt an issue.p  pUpdate The possibility of having to create and maintain 250,000 objects hexes is what has me mostly asking this question. This is why I am looking for ideas. 250k objects in flash is well lafp

Negative 1263 pFor documenting classes with roxygen2, specifying a title and descriptiondetails appears to be the same as for functions, methods, data, etc. However, slots and inheritance are their own sort of animal. What is the best practice  current or planned  for documenting S4 classes in roxygen2p  pDue Diligencep  pI found mention of an codeslotcode tag in early descriptions of roxygen.  a hrefhttplists.rforge.rproject.orgpipermailroxygendevel2008November000009.htmlA 2008 Rforge mailing list posta  seems to indicate that this is dead,  and there is no support for codeslotcode in roxygenp  pIs this true of roxygen2 The previouslymentioned post suggests a user should instead make their own itemized list with LaTeX markup. E.g. a new S4 class that extends the codecharactercode class would be coded and documented like thisp  precode The title for my S4 class that extends codecharacter class.   Some details about this class and my plans for it in the body.   describe     itemmyslot1A logical keeping track of something.      itemmyslot2An integer specifying something else.       itemmyslot3A data.frame holding some data.     name mynewclassclass  rdname mynewclassclass  exportClass mynewclass setClassmynewclass,     representationmyslot1logical,         myslot2integer,         myslot3data.frame,     contains  character  codepre  pHowever, although this works, this codedescribecode , codeitemcode approach for documenting the slots seems inconsistent with the rest of roxygen2, in that there are no codecodedelimited tags and slots could go undocumented with no objection from coderoxygenizecode. It also says nothing about a consistent way to document inheritance of the class being defined. I imagine dependency still generally works fine if a particular slot requires a nonbase class from another package using the codeimportcode tag. p  pSo, to summarize, what is the current bestpractice for roxygen2 slotsp  pThere seem to be three options to consider at the momentp  blockquote   ul   liA  Itemized list as example above.li   liB  codeslotcode ... but with extra tagsimplementation I missed. I was    unable to get slot to work with roxygen  roxygen2 in versions where    it was included as a replacement for the itemized list in the example    above. Again, the example above does work with roxygen2. li   liC  Some alternative tag for specifying slots, like codeparamcode, that    would accomplish the same thing.li   ul blockquote  pIm borrowingextending this question from a post I made to the coderoxygen2code development page on a hrefhttpsgithub.comklutometisroxygenissues34githuba.p

Negative 1263 phope that title makes sense. Im a noob at javascript. What I want to do is have a form which will have a couple of inputs like, name and url for example. p  pWhen the user enters their name, Id like the url input to automatically have as a default their name with an underscore between words. So if they type in as their name pedro kinkybottom then automatically set as the default in the url input would be pedrokinkybottom.p  pIm using cakephp if anyone happens to know a particularly cakey way to do this thatd be cool but otherwise any help at all would be most welcome.p  pThanks,p  pPedro p
Negative 1263 pOk, so Ive got a jQuery code which constructs my radio inputs from XML data, like thisp  precodevar items  xml.childrenitem if items.length gt 0      var ul  ltulgt,         class priceList          items.eachfunction         var this  this         var li  ltligt         var img  ltimggt,             src products  this.childrenimage.text,                  var input  ltinputgt,             type radio,             id this.childrenid.text,             name products                  var span  ltspangt,             text this.childrenprice.text   USD                  var label  ltlabelgt,             for this.childrenid.text                  label.appendimg         label.appendltbrgt         label.appendspan         li.appendinput         li.appendlabel         ul.hide.appendli.fadeInslow          return ul  return null codepre  pNow I need a nice way to find all unchecked radio labels and do something with them, e.g. fade them out or change a css property. Since the XML list consists of nearly 40 items, writing an ifelse construction is a nogo. Need a good solution. Thanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrong See my answer below.p
Negative 1263 pI have some calibrated maps using MapCalibrator, for which I need to find out the corresponding OSM style tiles.p  pWhile I have found some algorithms to calculate the tiles from geographical coordinates latlon, I am stuck at finding out the pixels location in latlon, based on the few calibrated points I have.p  pFor Ex I have a image 37585751 pixels, and following calibrated pointsp  precode x     y       lon      lat  1897  2224    26.3256  46.2311  3303  2708    26.43678 46.20419  2297  306     26.3577  46.3365  2135  4648    26.3423  46.0967  1885  1764    26.3236  46.2561  2091  2806    26.3386  46.1995  3613  2922    26.4604  46.1921 codepre  pHow can I compute the loatlon for an arbitrary pixelp  pPS1. The map is a touristic one, from a small enough region no idea what projection type uses.p  pPS2.

Negative 1263 pI recently began playing around with the ability of IIS to apply a warmup step step to my web application through use of the codeIProcessHostPreloadClientcode interface look a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20090915autostartaspnetapplicationsvs2010andnet40series.aspxherea for for guidance on how to set this up.

That is, until I noticed that all validation for my system no longer worked, neither client nor server validation.

Negative 1263 pIs there a typical workflow for hacking on Clojure librariesp  pSay I have my application Foo which relies on a thirdparty library Bar, which was obtained from a repository, and included in project Foo via codelein depscode.p  pThen, say I want to hack on library Bar, so I clone it from github.p  pNow, I would like to hack on my local clone Bar while at the same time working on application Foo that depends on it.  I would like all of the source files for Bar to open in Emacs along with all the source files in Foo, using one instance of swank.p  pIs there an easy way to do thisp  pI want to alter my emenvironmentem and not the project.

Negative 1263 pIm having a little problem writing 1s to a structs member.p  pI have a struct which represents a Voxel which can have 8 children IDs 07. In order to state which children a Voxel has Im using an unsigned 8bit integer. If the Voxel has a certain child, then the bit at the position in the children member that equals the childs ID is set to 1.p  pFor example, if a Voxels children member stored the value 10000101 Then the Voxel would have children 0, 2 and 7 from right to left.p  pThe code for the Voxel struct is as belowp  precodetypedef struct Voxel         uint8t children list of children        Voxel firstChildPointer  codepre  pFirst child pointer points to the start of a list of voxels which are this voxels children.p  pThe problem occurs when wanting to add a child. I need to change the children member to reflect the added child. When doing this however, I get a runtime exception saying Access violation writing location followed by a memory address.p  pThe code I use to change the children is belowp  precodevoid addVoxelVoxel parent, char childID         parentgtchildren  1 ltlt childID  codepre  pWhen all the Voxels are first loaded into memory the Voxels children is set without error. But after that I cannot write 1s to the member. 0s write perfectly fine. I have tried using many methods to write things, even a plain old assignment to a number. But if the number has more 1s then it wont work.p  pIt so happens that a pointer to the parent in this case it stored as a global variable, and each voxel also stores a pointer to its children, could this be the problem If so would passing the parent as a reference help I know how to do this in C but not in C.p  pAny help would be great.p  pS.p  pEDITp  pThe add voxel method is called using this linep  precodeaddVoxeloctree, 4 codepre  poctree is a voxel pointer as defined byp  precodeVoxel octree  octreeLoader.loadVoxelData codepre  pThe load voxel data method loads octree information from a file. We know that this section and the return pointer work as we use an exact duplicate of them to ray trace. However in short the pointer is created using this linep  precodeVoxel octree codepre  pAnd then assigned memory using this linep  precodeoctree  Voxel  calloc1, sizeofVoxel codepre  pChildren is then assigned using this linep  precodeoctree[0].children  children codepre  pEach further child is then created and given memory in the same way. I have checked the children member is initialised correctly and the childID is correct.p

Negative 1263 pIm working on a website using Dreamweaver CS5 and Im trying to load Fancybox 2.0.4 on dreamweaver cs5 while working on the website on my localhost using Live view to no avail. In addition Fancybox will not load in the same localhost environment using any browser Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera. However, when I load the page to the remote website ti works perfectly. Im using MAMP as my localhost server on MAC OS X Lion. I have been banging my head for weeks and have not found a solution. Any help will be appreciated.

Negative 1263 pI have two .csv files containing correlation matrices exported from R.  One file contains the Pvalues and one contains the rvalues.

I have tried a few strategies, including using the csv library to iterate through the files.  I looked into using numpy, but it doesnt seem that it will work for me .  I also looked into using scipy to calculate r and Pvalues Pearsons in Python, but it seems that this only works for comparing two one dimensional arrays I have 1700 columns of data to correlate.p  pCode I am starting with, to show you what I have importedp  precodeimport csv infileP  openAllcorrP.csv, rU infileR  openAllcorrR.csv, rU codepre  pstrongThe questionstrong Can anyone help me extract the column and row headers and rvalues from my rvalue file based on significant lt 0.05 Pvalues from my pvalue filep  pstrongORstrongp  pCalculate the r and Pvalues for all possible correlations between many columns of data directly using Python and extract only the results with significant Pvaluesp  pIn the end, I would like output in two files.br First filep  precodeSpecies1   Species2   Species4  ...

Negative 1263 pOk. I HAVE seen a LOT of topics which are similar to what Im trying to do here, but nothing that quite matches. Maybe my approach is way off base. Heres the deal.p  pIm drawing a chart to my UIView subclass in drawRect. I then use a UIPanGestureRecognizer to translate the charts offset internal, not in the view hierarchy to the rightleft. This works great, but my problem is that the recognizers action gets fired with relatively low frequency. Specifically, the resultant panning is MUCH choppier than, say, in a scrollview or tableview. Particularly when the number of points in my chart goes up. Now, what Id LIKE to do is not actually trigger drawing from the pan gestures action, but have a timer firing at something like 30 times per second, interpolating the offset from the moment the pan fired to the current moment. However, this is getting more and more complicated. p  pAnybody have suggestions Should I really just be doing this with a UIScrollView The reason Id prefer not to is that the data may extend quite far in either direction, and Id like to not have to draw or at least store the whole path at once, but just do the section which is currently displayed. Should I be using CAShapeLayer Id like some input before I spend another day playing around with these possibilities...p  pAny input  experiences would by most welcome.p

Negative 1263 pI want to generate strong types based on weakly typed data sources, using the F 3.0 type provider mechanism. The generated types must be accessible from C clients in an environment where only .Net 4.0 is installed, but not .Net 4.5. If .Net 4.0 compatibility is not possible, we cannot use type providers in our current largescale ERP project.p  pSo far, I have succeeded in creating MyGeneratedTypes.dll by following the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh36103428vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowtutoriala on msdn section Providing Generated Types, using the codeProvidedTypeDefinitioncode from ProvidedTypes0.2.fs, which is part of the F 3.0 sample pack. In order for it to work, I had to remove the line codeFile.Deletecode... from the codeProvidedTypeDefinition.ConvertToGeneratedcode... method. p  pMyGeneratedTypes.dll has runtime version v4.0.30319, which is OK the runtime of .Net 4.0. I can add a reference to MyGeneratedTypes.dll in a C.Net 4.0 application, and IntelliSense shows the types and members as expected. However, when I try to compile, the C compiler fails and produces warning MSB3258 The primary reference MyGeneratedTypes could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the .NET Framework assembly FSharp.Core, Version4.3.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb03f5f7f11d50a3a which has a higher version 4.3.0.0 than the version 4.0.0.0 in the current target framework.p  pA look at IL Spy confirms that MyGeneratedTypes.dll indeed contains a reference to FSharp.Core 4.3, eventhough this reference is completely unnecessary. So far, I have found no way to prevent the F compiler from putting this reference into the generated assembly. Among other things, I have created a pure .Net 4.0 assembly in C and passed it to the constructor of codeProvidedTypeDefinitioncode, but this has no influence.p  pDoes anybody know a how to get rid of the reference, or b if this is only an F 3.0 release candidate problem, which will be solved in the final release. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe conversation with Brian has resulted in the following partial solution to the problem You emcanem compile a pure C.Net 4.0 client referencing a library with F 3.0 generated types, but only by calling the .Net 4.0 C compiler emcscem directly emfrom the command lineem. It does not work when compiling in VS 2010 or via MSBuild command line. I suspect this is caused by the following behaviorp  ol liMyGeneratedTypes.dll is generated in VS 2012 with the F type provider mechanism.li liDuring generation, a reference to FSharp.Core 4.3 is automatically inserted even if not needed, without specifying SpecificVersiontrue in the metadata for the dependency.li liA C client in VS 2010 on a .Net 4.5free system references MyGeneratedTypes.dll.li liWhen the C client is compiled, MSBuild discovers the indirect reference to FSharp.Core 4.3 inside MyGeneratedTypes.dll. li liBecause the indirect reference exists with SpecificVersionfalse, MSBuild emits the warning emMSB3257em and refuses to pass the direct reference rMyGeneratedTypes.dll to the C compiler csc. Note MSBuild warnings cannot be suppressed in any way.li liThe C compiler csc is called by MSBuild, without rMyGeneratedTypes.dll. Therefore, it cannot compile, and emits compiler error CS0246 The type or namespace name MyGeneratedTypes could not be found ....li ol  pAs far as I can tell, were stuck with this problem unless the F type provider mechanism is modified either a to exclude the ref to FSharp.Core 4.3 when it is not needed in a generated assembly, or b to include the ref with the metadata codeSpecificVersiontruecode.p

Negative 1263 pI am currently creating a PHP website which allows administrators to upload a variety of documents pdf,doc,docx,xls which can then be downloaded at a later date. These can only be accessed by administrators after they have logged in. Up until this point to do this I have been storing files above the web root and then using PHP to access and serve the file via a PHP script hence preventing direct access to the files. This does work but never seems like an ideal way to do it as its reliant on setting the correct headers via PHP for the file download which does not always give the correct results on all browsers. I cant really see any other way of doing it that would also stop the files being publically accessible if they knew where they were located.p  pWhat process would you usually use to store and serve files on a web server that should not be publically accessiblep  pThanks so much,p  pDavep
Negative 1263 pIm developing an application that is meant to get information about the users location and the current weather.

For this to be accurate the process is repeated every X minute, but since Ive worked with activities the updating process interferes with other applications on the device.

Negative 1263 pPlease excuse the newbie question  my background is Unix and I am very green when it comes to WPF...p  pstrongContextstrong I need to design a single page WPFbased UI, using Visual Studio, or Blend.  p  pAdditionally, I need this to be portable outside the microsoft generated solution... this is because I need to be able to define the business logic within a different c environment, that is exposed by software called NinjaTrader for those who may use it.p  pemI am restricted to .NET 3.5em p  pstrongAdditional infostrong Right now, I am trying to get to proofofconcept as quickly as possible.  I have successfully implemented the UI using winforms. by simply designing the form within VS, and then copying the autogenerated designer code into my own abstract class definition say myForm within NinjaTrader.  I then have to inherit myForm into a new class definition within a standard NinjaTrader.Indicator class this is necessary to be able to instantiate the myForm2 class, and by passing the outer class to the constructor of myForm2, and overriding the methods I need for the business logic, I can display a UI upon OnStartUp of the NinjaTrader.Indicator class, and implement the behaviour that I need.p  pstrongMy problemstrong WPF is proving more difficult so far.  I have tried copying the class definitions from WPFWindow.xaml.cs, and also what is necessary from WPFWindow.g.cs into a single .cs file due to limitations within NinjaTrader, I must use a single file for this, and then instantiating this class from another NinjaTrader.Indicator class.p  pEverything is in the same namespace, though I am repeatedly stumped when it comes to the relative Uri and it seems I get the following message, no matter what I dop  blockquote   pCannot locate resource wpfwindowwpfwindow.xamlp blockquote  pNow  I am aware that the relative Uri will not be the same, when running from within a different application, and I have even tried copying the WPFWindow.xaml file to a new folder emwithinem what seems to be the current working directory, and emwithoutem any spaces and calculating the relative  p  precode    string cpath  Directory.GetCurrentDirectory     string installPath  CProgram Files x86NinjaTrader 7bin64WPFWindowWPFWindow.xaml     Uri cwUri  new Uricpath     Uri instUri  new UriinstallPath     string relPath  cwUri.MakeRelativeUriinstUri.ToString      System.Uri resourceLocater  new System.UrirelPath, System.UriKind.Relative      System.Windows.Application.LoadComponentthis, resourceLocater codepre  pHowever, I am still getting the same error.p  pI would be extremely grateful if anyone has any advice  suggestions as to how I might try to proceed.p  pIs there another way that I can load an XAML file that is external to the current application  project, emwithoutem using a relative Uri in order to display a single UI window  Any advice on what the bare minimum less is definitely more reliable in this case I would need to implement in order to do this and define the business logic, would be extremely helpful...p  pThanks in advance for any advicep  pJp  pEDIT amp Reponse to Brian Sp  pThanks for the response, and also for the reccomendation on material.  It is entirely possible that I have misunderstood the necessary architecture involved with WPF...p  pTherefore, please let me know it that is the case...  My understanding is as followsp  pThe graphical composition, content, layout, etc is emallem specified within the XAML file.  Behaviour, interaction, event handling etc is specified in the codebehind.p  pOnce the XAML markup has been written, I had made the assumption that, in order to instantiate the window I had designed, all I needed to do was to load  parse it into a tree of objects within  lets say  a class that inherits System.Windows.Window, and is named as the same class as in xclassmyClass, within the XAML file. p  pUpon rereading what I wrote previously, I realise that I was not all that clear about the situation.  I can use multiple files for the solution, without a problem, the issue arises as followsp  pWith classes that are partial, across 2 files  lets say file1.cs and file2.cs, class methods will only be recognized within the same file that they are defined unless I actually instantiate the class  after which I can call its methods.   So  for example  I could not specify InitializeComponent in file1.cs, and then define a constructor in file2 that refers to InitializeComponent...  I hope that makes sense...p  pWhat I can do, which seems to work, is to avoid defining methods outside of the file that I need to reference them in.  And thus, avoiding the use of partial classes as far as possible.  p  pI can define a class in one file say class1.cs, then instantiate it from another file say class2.cs no problem, by usingp  precodeprivate class1 mynewclass1  new class1args codepre  pI can also usep  precodeSystem.Windows.Application.LoadComponentargs codepre  pThough I seem to be running into issues with the relative addressing, as no matter what I try it does not seem to find the .xaml file..p  pIs there a way that I can try to load the xaml file without using relative addressing  I have been looking at XamlReader, though Im not sure it can do what I need....p  pThanks again,p  pJp

Negative 1263 pI feel like Im missing something very simple here. I want to play around with clang, so as a starting point I followed the code example in a hrefhttpdevimages.apple.comllvmvideosLibclang.mov relnofollowthis video, around 340a. The code is as followsp  precodeinclude clangcIndex.h  Note These two lines were  include ltstdio.hgt          omitted from the video slides int mainint argc, char argv[]      CXIndex Index  clangcreateIndex0, 0     CXTranslationUnit TU  clangparseTranslationUnitIndex, 0, argv, argc, 0, 0, CXTranslationUnitNone     for unsigned I  0, N  clanggetNumDiagnosticsTU I  N I              CXDiagnostic Diag  clanggetDiagnosticTU, I         CXString String  clangformatDiagnosticDiag, clangdefaultDiagnosticDisplayOptions         fprintfstderr, sn, clanggetCStringString         clangdisposeStringString          clangdisposeTranslationUnitTU     clangdisposeIndexIndex     return 0  codepre  pIn the video, he does not states that hes omitted the two codeincludecode directives. I think I correctly filled those in in my example above. He also omits how the file was compiled and linked, which is the part Im having trouble with. Following the instructions a hrefhttpclang.llvm.orggetstarted.html relnofollowherea I checked out and compiled clang and llvm. The files were checked out to codesrcllvmcode then compiled from codesrcbuildcode just as the instructions say, and now Im trying to make the simple test project above in codesrctestcode. Below is how Im calling gcc, and the output. p  precodegcc I..llvmtoolsclanginclude L..buildDebugAssertslib lclang main.cpp o test tmpccrpABsq.o In function main main.cpp.text0x24 undefined reference to clangcreateIndex main.cpp.text0x5f undefined reference to clangparseTranslationUnit main.cpp.text0x74 undefined reference to clanggetNumDiagnostics main.cpp.text0x8b undefined reference to clanggetDiagnostic main.cpp.text0x93 undefined reference to clangdefaultDiagnosticDisplayOptions main.cpp.text0xab undefined reference to clangformatDiagnostic main.cpp.text0xc0 undefined reference to clanggetCString main.cpp.text0xed undefined reference to clangdisposeString main.cpp.text0x10d undefined reference to clangdisposeTranslationUnit main.cpp.text0x118 undefined reference to clangdisposeIndex collect2 ld returned 1 exit status make  [all] Error 1 codepre  pI checked codebuildDebutAssertslibcode and there is both codelibclang.acode and codelibclang.socode in that directory.

Negative 1263 pI have the following ksh scriptp  precodesqlplus usr1pw1DB1 DIRa.sql 1 amp sqlplus usr2pw2DB2 DIRb.sql 1 amp wait echo Done codepre  pWhere DIR is a variable with the absolute path where a.sql and b.sql are.p  pFor some time, Ive been running this script daily and it works fine. The intentions is that both SQLPlus sessions go to the background and execute in parallel, and when they finish I can continue with the following steps of the application.p  pSince its not a test version anymore, I scheduled it on the crontab to execute daily. The problem I have now is that it wont pause on wait and let the sqlplus sessions finish, but it directly outputs Done. In the real app, that echo Done is actually a call to another program to do some processing on a.sqls and b.sqls output. But since its not waiting for both sql scripts to actually finish, the processing cannot be done.p  pIt works absolutely perfect when I run it myself, wether I do it from the local directory or from the root as crontab would do it. But when it is executed automatically by the crontab, It doesnt stop at wait and screws the whole thing up.p  pAny ideas on what might be happening Thanksp

Negative 1263 pWhen I bind the codeDataContextcode of a codeUserControlcode the binding works correctly. When I debug the program, I can see that the codeDataContextcode of the codeUserControlcode is bound to the correct codeViewModelcode. However, when I bind to specific properties like a text box in the codeUserControlcode to the codeViewModelcode, something fails. The codeUserControlcode will pick up the initial values of the codeViewModelcode correctly. If I have some binding string property with a default value of test, the codeUserControlcode displays this correctly. However, none of the changes get propagated back to the codeViewModelcode. So entering abcd into the textbox originally displaying test does not update the codeViewModelcode to abcd. The codeViewModelcode incorrectly contains the test string. p  pIf the above was unclear or not specific enough, continue on.

Negative 1263 pI recently implemented Selectivizr on an internal company website as we need to support IE78. Unfortunately, our site does a lot of dynamic content loading via jQueryAJAX.p  pTo solve this problem, I overloaded the jQuery ready function to reload Selectivizr after it performs whatever task it was set out to. My code looks like thisp  precodefunction       if body.ie8, body.ie7, body.compview8, body.compview7.length gt 0          function               var original  jQuery.fn.ready             var getSelectivizr             jQuery.fn.ready  function                    Execute the original method.                 original.applythis, arguments                  clearTimeoutgetSelectivizr                 getSelectivizr  setTimeoutfunction                       .getScriptselectivizr                 , 50                              codepre  pSimple enough.

It Compatibility View, it actually opens for a splitsecond and then closes. The second click opens it just fine as long as you remain focused on the dropdown.p  pI had assumed it might be an issue with what Selectivizr was doing, as it wasnt really designed to work with dynamically loaded content, but after a little bit of debugging, it seems that its the setTimeout that is causing this strange behavior.p  pIm at a complete loss how to strongfix this without removing my Selectivizr implementationstrong.p  pIt is probably worth noting that the setTimeout is necessary to prevent the browser from attempting to load Selectivizr multiple times if different AJAX calls are made as this can cause serious performance issues within the browser.p  pemstrongNote this question does not accurately reflect the issue stated in the title, so I updated it to provide better searching After coming back to this problem a few weeks later, I recognized that my initial debugging had led me down the wrong path.

Negative 1263 pIve got a strange problem which I need help with. Ive made a C program that gets some data from a .txt file and writes some data to another .txt file. When I compile and run the program by Xcode, it makes the output file in the same directory as the program file  thats exactly what I need. But when I close Xcode and run the program just by doubleclicking on it, it creates an output file in my Users directory. Is there a way to fix thisp
Negative 1263 pIm building an application that receive positional flat files from a legacy application and for each detail row I need to search inside a third application for some data and then fill up  my database. And in case of any mal formed line in file, I need to stop de processing and log the line and position of malformed string.p  pAt least for now, the files have, max. 50MB.p  pIm very confuse who is best suitable for this scenario, Biztalk and SSIS have similar features and, as far I can see, both are suitable in this scenario. This is a task I could make a good use of Biztalk or I should go with a ETL solution Integration Services p

Negative 1263 pIn a mobile web app that Im building I keep getting the same problem over and over again.  In my index.php I redirect to the login.php if no value in my session is set. After the user logs in I redirect back to index.php. Ive tried this with a header redirection via PHP as well as via a .mobile.changePage method from JQuery. p  pWhat happens with both ways Is that at first the page division of home loads. When I use my Navbar to change to a new page division in the same multipage it loads the login.php again. p  pindex.php p  precodesessionstart require init.inc  email  SESSION[email] ifissetemailheaderLocation login.html else     echo     ltDOCTYPE hmtlgt     lthtml langengt         ltheadgt             ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt             ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0, userscalable0, minimumscale1.0, maximumscale1.0gt             ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappcapable contentyesgt             ltmeta nameapplemobilewebastatusbarstyle contentblackgt              lt link naar iconsgt             ltlink relappletouchicon sizes114x114 hrfappletouchicon.pnggt              lttitlegtLoyalty Barcodelttitlegt              lt link naar stylesheet gt             ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssmobile.css gt             ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0b3jquery.mobile1.0b3.min.cssgt             ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssthemesloyalty.css gt              lt link naar de jquery en javascript gt             ltscript srcjsfunctions.jsgtltscriptgt             ltscript srcjsJquery.loadphp.jsgtltscriptgt             ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.6.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt             ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0b3jquery.mobile1.0b3.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltheadgt         ltbodygt          lt home barcode gt         ltdiv datarolepage idhomegt                 lt header gt             ltheader dataroleheader datathemeagt                 lth1gtLoyalty Homelth1gt                 lta hrefinstellingen datarolebutton dataminitrue datathemeb datainlinetrue dataiconposnotext dataicongear classuibtnrightgtltagt             ltheadergt             lt einde header gt              ltarticle idbarcodegt                 lt Content gt                 ltdiv classcontentgt                     ltpgtHier vind u, uw Loyalty barcode.

I receive the data encrypted, I decrypt it once and allow my application to use the decrypted version.brbr strongWhat I havestrongbrbr I came up with different solutions, but not satifisfied with any of them. This is what I triedp  ol liOne class with boolean flag encrypted, initially set to be true and then unset after the data is decrypted. The cons, the same fields are multiused, sounds unsafe even though there is a private flag another con, some fields are of different type once decrypted, say an ID, Ideally I want the decrypted version to be in the correct final type, so that wont work with adding new fields to the same class, which makes it messy and will complicate other tasks such as data binding, etcli liThought about decorator pattern, but the way it works is to have the decorator and the subject class implement the same interface, but again return types will vary after decryptionli lithought about having 2 classes, one for the decrypted version of the class and other for the encrypted. however, code reuses is abandoned in this approach, to fix that thought about having the decrypted version extend the encrypted one and reuse the getters of the encrypted fields that dont change type after decryption, but fields that change type cannot be overridenli li thought about leaving data in String format even after decryption, and convert to integers outside of the class, but this is redundant and will clutter my code with silly code fragments whenever I need to use the integer fields of the classli ol  pAny ideas for how to go about solving this design problemp

Negative 1263 pMy app has a has a QTreeWidget that takes a QDate in one of its columns. Since the columns accept QVariants they can hold practically any kind of data. Ive found that the TreeWidget must use the actual QDate objects instead of QStrings for the column sorting functionality to work correctly. If I use QStrings for dates, they wont sort  in the proper chronological order but rather by the numerical values of the strings. which is wrong My program supports several date formats USA Style, European style, and ISO8601 style.

Negative 1263 pIve been looking at wrapping a file watcher in an observable to aide in processing events but Im having some trouble figuring out how to get the behaviour I want out of it. The file watcher watches a directory into which files are placed. When a file is first placed into that directory the Created event is fired on the file watcher. However if the file is large or the network connection slow then a series of Changed events are fired as the file updates. I dont want to process the file until it has finished being written so what I really need is this timelinep  precodeCreated    Changed   Changed   Changed                         Write starts       Write finishes       Processing Starts     codepre  pI looked at a number of methods of filtering the events in Rx but I couldnt get what I need which is fire a function once a file file has not been changed for X seconds. Throttle is no good as it will lose events in the middle. Buffer is no good as events might occur on the buffer boundary. p  pI had thought about using timeouts but I wasnt crazy that they threw an exception and I wanted the processing to start as files were being written and not once there were no more events at all.  p  pThere is a similar question at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2677976reactiveextensionsvsfilesystemwatcherReactive Extensions vs FileSystemWatchera which was never really solved.p  pIs there a method such that I can do this easily Im sure this is not an uncommon use case. p
Negative 1263 pI have a Python script codemyscript.pycode which generates a list of tabseparated pairings between two elements, one for each line p  precode python myscript.py cat dog dog wolf cat dog pig chicken dog cat codepre  pI am looking to pipe the output of this script into a terminal command of some sort that I want to filter out duplicate emcombinationsem, not just duplicate permutations.  For duplicate permutations, I can use something likep  precode python myscript.py  sort  uniq cat dog dog cat dog wolf pig chicken codepre  pto remove the duplicate cat dog. The problem with this approach is that I am left with both cat dog and dog cat, which for my purposes should be treated as the same same combination.  I know I could write another very simple Python script to perform the kind of filtering I am after, but I wanted to see whether there is an even simpler terminal command that will do the equivalent.p

Negative 1263 pI dont know if its a bug or if there is an option somewhere, but all my c source code files from the jni folder are included in my apk file. Not a good idea.

Negative 1263 pI have a HTML Table that Im using as a calendar. Normally, this calendar is viewed at 690 pixels wide which makes each column 98 pixels wide 690  7  98. I want each date to be square, so theyre also 98 pixels on the height.p  pI have a CSS class that is used on all of the dates. This has the height property set to 98 pixels. I also have a button at the bottom that lets the users view the calendar at full screen. So that means that the table width would be set to 100 because of all of the different screen resolutions. But, again, I need all of the dates to be square. So I need some JavaScript or preferably jQuery to calculate what 14 of the screen resolution is because theres 7 days and its across 100 of the screen. So now each column will be 14.p  pI assume that the jQuery would be better for this because of changing the CSS height property to whatever is calculated, but JavaScript will work too.p  pI know nothing about jQuery and I dont know how to do this with JavaScript.p
Negative 1263 pI am developing a project in which some audio data need to be playback in Unity 4. The sample rate of input data is 24000 Hz 24kHz, and normally the default sample rate of speaker in system is 44100 44.1kHz. In Windows, I can use AudioSettings.outputSampleRate  24000 to change this device sample rate with no problem. But I found it impossible in Mac OS. Even after I changed it, if I print the value, I still got 44100. Sometime I even got an error messagep  pTrying to reload asset from disk that is not stored on diskp  pSo I suspect that Mac OS forbids user to change this value in users application.p  pAccording to the description here a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comDocumentationScriptReferenceAudioSource.Play.html relnofollowhttpdocs.unity3d.comDocumentationScriptReferenceAudioSource.Play.htmlap  pI tried to set the delay value in AudioSource.Play to solve it.

This is the only type of codeSuggestioncode that has a target of sorts. It would in theory point to one tag.

Negative 1263 pI have to get the contents texts for some exercises from several word documents lots of them and transform them so they can be loaded in a Javascript application.p  pAn example of the contents of these word documents isp  hr  p1.Text question 1  p  panswer 1br answer 2br answer 3p  p2.Text strongquestionstrong 2 with one        or more. p  panswer 1br answer 2br answer 3p  petcp  hr  pSo theres one line with the question, a blank line, and then 3 lines with the possible answers. In the example Ive put 2 questions, but there can be 12 per word document. Please note that in words in the question text could be underlined or bolded. Also there could be blank spaces represented by several  characters, with or without spaces inbetween.p  pThe output format for these word documents would be something likep  precodevar questions  [  label  1.Text question 1, options  [answer 1, answer 2, answer 3], answer  [1] Here I will need to set the right answer, probably manually ,  label  1.Text ltstronggtquestionltstronggt 2, options  [answer 1, answer 2, answer 3], answer  [0] Here I will need to set the right answer, probably manually , etc ] codepre  pSo its a basic associative array in JS. Please note that the label key will hold the text of the questions in html format so in the example theres a codeltstronggtcode tag to reflect the bold word in the second question.p  pWhat Im looking for is a script that accepts as input a word document like the example and outputs a JS file also like my output example if its a text file that works as well. The scripting languages would be best if its PHP or Javascript. Its OK if I have to do a little work on the word documents to adapt something to make the script easier.p  pThe main challenge for me with this is how to keep all the text styles bold, underline, blank spaces... that the text can have, otherwise transforming them to simple txt files I guess would work...p  pAny help with this would be appreciatedp

Negative 1263 pIm doing a simple showhide script where I have 2 sections of text that are hidden. I have created 2 read more links with help of createTextNode. My problem is that the link text Read more is suppose to change to Hide once the link has been clicked and the hidden text is showing and when I click on Hide it should change back to Read more. But I cant seem to find the right way to change the nodeValue for this, probably because Im trying to reach the node from the second function hideShow.p  pAnother smaller question as well.

Negative 1263 pIve got a new requirement to change my display.p  pCurrently I have a row of 3 radio buttons sitting above a Panel with a card layout.  The buttons CONTROL which card of the Card Layout Panel is displayed.  But this, it seems, wastes valuable screen real estate.p  pThe row of buttons can easily be transformed to a column of buttons using a GridLayout4,1 on the panel that owns them and their title label.  This panel could then theoretically be placed in the upper left corner of the each of the cards displayed in the card layout panel, and the top row of each card could be moved up to the right of the button panel, allowing more space for what has to come below.p  pBut what shall be the containment model for this  In this variant, the button panel must appear on each card.  Who owns it  Logically it needs to be owned by the parent panel on which all this sits, but it wont display on the cards, which will cover it over  unless I could p  ol liadd the button panel to each card at the moment of its display, which would probably be messy and maybe cause flicker.li limake the top left corner of each card be transparent, allowing it to show the upper left button panel owned by its parent.  But how would I do thatli ol  pOther solutionsp  pMaybep  ol liHave two card layout panels controlled by the radio buttons.

Negative 1263 pIm working on a class derived from the WPF codeWindowcode class that behaves as an applicaton toolbar window called codeAppBarWindowcode.  I have been able to find various WinForms implementations, but no WPF implementtions.p  pIve got a lot of the code working, but I need to know when the user starts dragging the window around the screen and when they stop, as the windows behavior will differ.  The default WPF handling isnt quite right, so Ive implemented my own Window Procedure and installed it using an codeHwndSourcecode object.p  pIve got this working in an applicaton at work that does not have a nonclient area.  In that case, theres a codeLeftMouseButtonDowncode event handler that sets a flag to true, then calls the codeDragMovecode method which drags the window around.  When that method returns, I set the flag to false.  Everything works.p  pBut Im working now on a general class that wont use the codeDragMovecode method.  I can add another codeLeftMouseButtonDowncode handler for the window, but I dont believe that will get called if the mosue is in the nonclient area.p  pHow am I going to detect that the user is dragging thw window and when theyve stopped in this casep

Negative 1263 pstrongUpdate 2013 Oct, 1ststrongp  pToday I finally found out what was the issue. After debugging for hours with xdebug and trying to execute multiple scripts I noticed that the body of the script is not the problem. When executing tests worker with a sleep of 1020 seconds Ive noted that the CPU was idling most of the time and so deducted that was consuming the most of the CPU is to bootstrap Symfony.p  pMy scripts were very quickly executed and killed to pawn to new script, etc. Ive fixed it adding a codedowhilecode that is exiting after a random amount of seconds to avoid all the worker to restart at the same time. p  pIve reduced the load from an average of 3545 to an average of 0.51.5 Thats a strongHUGE improvementstrong. To Resume Symfony is bootstrapped once and after the script is just waiting until a random timeout to kill itself and launch a new instance of itself. This is to avoid script to hang or the database connection to timeout, etc.p  pIf you have a better solution do not hesitate to share. Im so happy strongto go from 100 CPU usage x4 servers because of the autoscaling to less than 1 and only one serverstrong for the same amount of work, its even faster now.p  hr  pstrongUpdate 2013 Sep, 24thstrongp  pJust noticed that the console component of Symfony is using codedevcode environment by default. Ive specified codeprodcode in the command line code.appconsole envprod mycommandactioncode and I divide by 5 the execution time which is pretty good. p  pdelAlso I have the feeling that codecurlexeccode is eating a lot of CPU but Im not sure. delp  pIm trying to debug the CPU usage using xdebug, reading the generated cachegrind, but there is no reference of CPU cycle used per function, class, ... Only the time spent and memory used.p  pIf you want to use xdebug in a PHP command line just use codeusrbinenv php d xdebug.profilerenableOncode at the top of the scriptp  pIf anyone has a tip to debug this with xdebug Ill be happy to hear it p  hr  pIm asking this question without real hope. p  pI have a server that I use to run workers to process some background tasks. This server is an EC2 server m1.small inside an autoscaling group with high CPU alert setup.p  pI have something like 20 workers php script instance waiting for jobs to be processed. To run the script Im using the console component of codeSymfony 2.3 frameworkcode.p  pThere is not much happening in the job, fetching data from URL, looping over the results and insert it row by row 1000 rows per job in MySQL RDS server.p  pThe thing is that with 1 or 2 workers running, the CPU is at 100 I dont think its like at 100 all the time but its spiking every second or so which cause the autoscaling group to launch new instances.p  pId like to reduce the CPU usage which is not justified at all. I was looking at phpfpm fastCGI but it looks like its for web servers only. PHP client wouldnt use it rightp  pAny help would be appreciated,  Cheers p

Negative 1263 pI have a plugin that uses codeapplyfilterscode like thisp  precodeadditionalfields  applyfiltersattachmentmetaaddfields, additionalfields codepre  pIn my themes codefunctions.phpcode, I dop  precodefunction addAttachmentMetaadditionalFields      return addtionalFields  addfilter attachmentmetaaddfields, addAttachmentMeta, 1, 1  codepre  pBut the function codeaddAttachmentMetacode never runs.p  pHow can I alter my apply or add filter statements to make it so that codeaddAttachmentMetacode gets calledp  pEdit This is a custom plugin that I wrote based off tutorials on how to add additional attachment meta fields. The whole source is here a hrefhttppastebin.com7NcjDsK5 relnofollowhttppastebin.com7NcjDsK5a.  As I mentioned in the comments, I know this is running and working because I can add additional fields in this plugin file, but not by using the filters because the filter doesnt get added.p  pI can see vardumps before and after the codeapplyfilterscode statement, but the function Ive pointed to with codeaddfiltercode never gets called.p
Negative 1263 pI have the following table ordered by Id, Year DESCp  pre Id   Year   Valid 1    2011   1 1    2010   1 1    2009   0 1    2002   1 4    2013   1 4    2012   1 4    2011   1 etc. pre  pWhat I would like to have is an extra rank field likep  pre Id   Year   Valid   Rank 1    2011   1       1 1    2010   1       1 1    2009   0       2 1    2002   1       3 4    2013   1       1 4    2012   1       1 4    2011   1       1 etc. pre  pBasically per Id alternating ranks for every change in the Valid field. In such a way I can query on the rank1 field to have all Valid1 records for each and every Id up to the first Valid0.

Negative 1263 pMy question is pretty clear, I think, but to provide context Im rebuilding an application that was used for judging in a contest.  One of the issues were trying to address is data corruption one of the devices had its data store completely corrupted by receiving bad data from the server which it promptly uploaded back emtoem the server, corrupting the server as well.  For obvious reasons, this is a bug that needs fixing  both from a practical can we use this app again standpoint and from a point of programmers pride and reputation.p  pThere are two scenarios for how this might have happened.  The first scenario is character encoding failures, which I think I can safely ignore because JSON was used to transfer the data around  and JSON mandates the use of a specific character encoding UTF8.  Im planning to use RESTKit for version 2.0 of the app, so hopefully restkit p  pThe second scenario is the one Im wrestling with, because the WiFi at the event was emhorribleem.  While it seems unlikely, evidence suggests that its at least possible for the actual TCP communications stream to be compromised without causing the resulting data to fail JSON validation.p  pAll of which leads me to ask what tools or underlying, automatically activated features does iOS andor RestKit provide to help protect against the data being corrupted in transit  Since I control the server code, I can change what the API reports if neededp

Negative 1263 pstrongCstrongp  pGiven a base class codeBasecode and a derived class codeDerivedcode, the first thing constructed by codeDerivedcodes constructor is the codeBasecode subobject. Since its called a subobject, I assumed it can be accessed from client code like any other member object by using the dot operator on the codeDerivedcode object. I also assumed it can be accessed from codeDerivedcodes implementation code by codethisgtBasecode. A statement comprised entirely of the name of an object that has already been initialized followed by a semicolon should compile but also have no effect. Following that logic, given a codeDerivedcode object codemyderivedcode, I tried codemyderived.Basecode in client code and codethisgtBasecode in codeDerivedcodes implementation and neither statement compiles.p  pWhy I know codeBasecode, by itself, is the name of the codeBasecode class and not of a codeBasecode object. But I thought codeBasecode qualified by the codemyderived.code client code or codethisgtcode implementation code prefix refers to the base subobject because codeBasecode, without any prefix qualifications, is the way the codeBasecode subobject is referred to in codeDerivedcodes constructor initializer. Refer to the below code, which commentedout code aside works in VC12 and g 4.8. codeDerivedcode extends codeBasecode and codeDerivedcodes definition declares a codeBasecode data member codemembasecode, so my codeDerivedcode object should contain two codeBasecode objects. Assuming the successful compilation isnt the result of any compilerStandardnonconformity, the console output in the comments, which shows different values for the codeintcode members codencode for the two different codeBasecode objects, implies that in codeDerivedcodes ctor initializer, codeBasecode refers to the inherited codeBasecode subobject whereas codemembasecode refers to the declared data member object. In codeDerivedcodes ctor initializer, codeBasecode refers specifically to the inherited subobject, not just any codeBasecode object nor the codeBasecode class.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  struct Base      Baseint par  npar      void foo  stdcout ltlt Base  ltlt n ltlt stdendl      int n   struct Derived  Base      Derived  Base2, membase3      Base membase     void foo  stdcout ltlt Derived  ltlt n ltlt stdendl        void g  thisgtBase   Error in VC12 amp g 4.8       VC12 error C2273 functionstyle cast  illegal as      right side of gt operator   int main      Derived myderived       myderived.Base Error in VC12 amp g 4.8       VC12 error C2274 functionstyle cast  illegal as      right side of . operator      myderived.foo            OUTPUT Derived 2     myderived.Basefoo      OUTPUT Base 2     myderived.membase.foo    OUTPUT Base 3  codepre  ol lipAgain, shouldnt codemyderived.Basecode or codethisgtBasecode uniquely refer to the inherited codeBasecode subobject and compilepli lipDoes the codeBasecode in codemyderived.Basecode or codethisgtBasecode refer to the codeBasecode subobject or the codeBasecode class or anything at allpli lipIn general, are inherited base subobjects considered data members of derived classespli lipFrom the perspective of codeDerivedcode, does codeBasecode only refer to the inherited subobject within the context of codeDerivedcodes constructor initializer and only refer to the codeBasecode class outside codeDerivedcodes ctor initializerpli lipHow can I access the inherited codeBasecode subobject through the codeDerivedcode object, as in, how can I express the inherited codeBasecode subobject of the codeDerivedcode object in codeDerivedcodes implementation code and in client codepli lipThe use of the scope resolution operator in codemyderived.Basefoocode, where codefoocode is a method of codeBasecode, compiles in VC12 and g 4.8. Does this mean codeBasecode is a data member of codemyderivedcode, since it is qualified by codemyderivedcode and the dot operator If so, then is that codeBasecode the codeBasecode class or the codeBasecode subobjectpli lipBut codemyderived.Base.foocode doesnt compile. AFAIK access of an objects member is qualified in client code by the object name and dot operator. Two kinds of things that are qualified by the scope resolution operator, instead of the object name and dot operator, are a outside access to anything that belongs to a namespace and b the names of static data members and names of member functions of definitions defined outside their class definition, in which case the codeBasecode that precedes the codecode refers to the codeBasecode class, not any codeBasecode instance. Does this mean the codeBasecode in codemyderived.Basecode is a namespace or refers to the classpli lipIf so, then is its being a namespace or referring to the class conditional upon whether it is appended by a codecode followed by a member of codeBasecodepli lipIf the answer to 7 is yes, then why It would seem incongruous with the following logic a namespaces enclosure of one variable does not in itself enable the namespace to enclose or construct other instances of the variables type. The namespace only owns one instance of that typethe variable it encloses. The same goes for a member that is part of a class, as in, static data member. The class only owns one instance of that typethe static data member it encloses. In contrast, there are as many samenamed nonstatic data members of a class as there are instances of the class.pli lipGiven method codehcode of codeBasecode and a codeDerivedcode object codemyderivedcode, codemyderived.Basehcode compiles in VC12 and g 4.8. Addionally, a hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.coma591476631f6cd693 relnofollowemg 4.8 canema take any arbitrary number of extra codeBasecodes in that statement, like codemyderived.BaseBasehcode. Such a statement seems to imply codeBasecode is a member of codeBasecode. But VC12 gives codeerror C3083 ctor the symbol to the left of a  must be a typecode. But given codeBasecode object codemybasecode, VC12 compiles codemybase.Basehcode just fine, which would also imply VC12 is fine with treating a class as a member of itself. But that contradicts its inability to compile the prior statement. Also, VC12 cannot compile any version of codemybase.Basehcode that has any number of extra codeBasecodes e.g. codemybase.BaseBasehcode, but g can. Which compiler is correct, if anypli lipIn any case, does that mean a namespace or class can contain itself Given a global codeintcode variable codexcode, the statement codexcode with two scope resolution operators doesnt compile in either compiler, so Im assuming the global scope doesnt contain the global scope.pli ol

Negative 1263 pi got a little problem whit the jnice plugin. i found a work arround to make work something like a click method. its something like thisp  precode checkbox.parent.finda.clickfunction         ifthis.hasClassjNiceChecked         action when is checked     else         unchecked          codepre  pso it works fine on the chrome console but it doesnt get executed in code even whit the document ready function. i guess the problem is that jnice.js creates the dom element after the document gets ready so i can select dom elements that dont exist yet. is there some jnice method or a worck arround for getting the code executedp

The page already has jquery, and trying to handle a post form with JavaScript not jquery gives an error 500, so I have decided to figure out a jquery solution.p  pEverything works. Except that I cant return proper php errors with ajax.

Negative 1263 pIm currently working on coderbytes medium challenge entitled Permutation Step.p  pThe goal is to take user input, num, and to return the next number emgreater than num using the same digitsem So, for example, if user input is 123, then the number 132 should be returned. If user input is 12453, then 12534 should be returned...p  pAnywho, I have a correct model answer created by someone probably a genius, cuz this stuff is pretty hard and Im trying to figure out how the answer works, line for line by having an example play out Im keeping it simple and playing out the function with user input 123. p  pThe answer has 2 functions, but the 1st function used is what Im currently trying to work out...p  pThe relevant code isp  precodevar PermutationStep1  functionnum     var num1  num.toString   var ar  []   return num1   if num1.length lt 2     return num     else       forvar i  0 i lt num1.length i          var num2  num1[i]        var num3  num1.substr0,i  num1.substri1, num1.length 1        var numAr  PermutationStep1num3        forvar j  0 j lt numAr.length j           ar.pushnumAr[j]  num2                     ar.sortfunctiona,b return ab      return ar        codepre  pAgain, Im trying to work thru this function with the inputted num as 123 num  123.p  pIm pretty sure that this function should output an array with multiple elements, because the 2nd function merely compares those array elements with the original user input in our case, 123, and returns the next greatest value.p  pSo in our case, we should probably get an array, named ar, returned with a host of 3 digit values. But for some reason, Im getting an array of 2 digit values. I cant seem to isolate my mistake and where Im going wrong.

Negative 1263 pIn MySQL theres the codeDEFAULTcode keyword which lets the DB know that it should just use the columns defined default valuep  blockquote   pUse the keyword DEFAULT to set a column explicitly to its default   value. This makes it easier to write INSERT statements that assign   values to all but a few columns, because it enables you to avoid   writing an incomplete VALUES list that does not include a value for   each column in the table. Otherwise, you would have to write out the   list of column names corresponding to each value in the VALUES list.p blockquote  pIn theory thats nice for prepared INSERT statements. The problem is that a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenpdo.constants.php relnofollowPHP doesnt seem to havea a way to bind a codecode placeholder to the codeDEFAULTcode keyword, like it has for codeNULLcode codePDOPARAMNULLcode. So how can you achieve a completely general, and thus emreusableem, prepared statement where some parameters should accept the default value some of the time without knowing it beforehandp  pIm currently working on a thin DB model layer and this is preventing me from making the best use of prepared statements, which is a thing if you want to use it for mass inserts.p

Negative 1263 pI am customizing this Tumblr for someone who asked that I move the menu items above the header, including social buttons. I solved this in the Effector theme by selecting Pages in top bar which moved the Music, Gallery, and Contact buttons on the top left and then opted to forego the social widgets in the theme and instead linked images of select social buttons to the musicians social sites. It looks exactly how I want it to look on a computer, but this top menu disappears in mobile view. Im not quite sure what I need to input in CSS, or maybe thats not the route to go.

Negative 1263 pIm working on an application that takes the rowid of a user selected record in a Sqlite database shown using TableLayout, and displays the associated record on another fragment DataEdit for editing. This works GREAT only on the first time I open DataEdit after selecting a table row. However, if I go back to the table tab and select a different record, then go back to DataEdit tab, the selected row is not shown. Most curiously selectedTableRecordViewv does run, even showing the desired rowid via a Toast message see below code. Mapping this function to a button on the DataEdit tab and then pressing it after this second iteration causes the correct record to populate fields on this tab.

Negative 1263 pstrongI have the following goalstrongp  ol lipUse input vertex data to perform vertex processing vertex, tessealation andor geometry shaders. This should take all objectspace vertex data from different meshspecific buffers, transform them into world space and store it into a singe world mesh buffer. Also use the geometry shader to analyze the mesh in world space e.g. collision detection. The vertex data and the collision detection output would be transformfeedbackd into different buffers.pli lipUse the world space vertex data in another vertex processing stage, which will apply view transformations and perspective projection. This will allow moving around the camera without repeating a potentially expensive objecttoworld space transformations e.g. instantiating a bezier surface. At this stage camerarelated mesh analysis can be done e.g. raytriangle intersection for mouse selection. As before, the vertex data and the raytriangle intersection data would be written into separate buffers.pli lipUse the camera space vertex data to rasterize the mesh and render into the frame buffer. Updating the screen e.g. window getting resized would only require to repeat the third pass. Moving the camera around wold only require to repeat the second and third passes.pli ol  pThe point of having the entire pipeline split into these 3 stages isp  ul liDo vertex processing for rendering and for GPGPU collision detection, raytriangle intersection, ... all at once, thus avoiding repetition.li liReuse model transformations when no worldspace changes have been made.li ul  pstrongHeres what I havestrongp  pMy prototype solution that only separates the pipeline onto two stages stage 1 and stage 2 are combined for now. I created two programs for each of those stages. The fist one only has a vertex shader and a geometry shader and the second one only has a passthrough vertex shader and a fragment shader. I successfully set up everything necessary to get the first stage to perform. I tested this by mapping the transform feedback buffer and querying the transform feedback primitive count. I tried messing around with the vertices in the geometry shader and the result reflected the changes accordingly. I have two vertex array objects one for the input vertex data and one for the transform feedback output vertex data.p  pstrongHeres my problemstrongp  pWhen I try to bind the transform feedback buffer to the GLARRAYBUFFER binding point and use the second vertex array object for it I get nothing. I used the OpenGL profiler for OSX to check for any GL errors by setting breakpoints on everything and nothing happens. So I dont cause a GL error, I get the feedback data by mapping the buffer but I dont see anything getting rendered. I tried both glDrawTransformFeedback and glDrawArrays by manually querying the primitive count.p  pstrongNotestrongp  pMy code base is highly integrated with Cocoa and is spread across many files. I do realize that I will have to post some source code so please tell me which parts you need to see and Ill collect them and post them in a neat manner.p

Negative 1263 h1Maintenance Edith1  pAfter using this approach for a while I found myself only adding the exact same boilerplate code in every controller so I decided to do some reflection magic. In the meantime I ditched using MVC for my views  Razor is just so tedious and ugly  so I basically use my handlers as a JSON backend. The approach I currently use is to decorate my queriescommands with a codeRoutecode attribute that is located in some common assembly like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode[Routeitemsadd, RouteMethod.Post] public class AddItemCommand  public Guid Id  get set    [Routeitems, RouteMethod.Get] public class GetItemsQuery  IQueryltGetItemsResponsegt     The response inherits from a base type that handles  validation messages and the like public class GetItemsResponse  ServiceResponse   codepre  pI then implemented an MVC host that extracts the annotated commandsqueries and generates the controllers and handlers for me at startup time. With this my application logic is finally free of MVC cruft. The query responses are also automatically populated with validation messages. My MVC applications now all look like thisp  pre  MvcApp    Global.asax    Global.asax.cs  Startup the host and done    Web.config pre  pAfter realizing I really dont use MVC outside the host  and constantly having issues with the bazillion dependencies the framework has  I implemented another host based on a hrefhttpsgithub.comNServiceKitNServiceKit relnofollowNServiceKita. Nothing had to be changed in my application logic and the dependencies are down to codeSystem.Webcode, codeNServiceKitcode and codeNServiceKit.Textcode that takes good care of the model binding. I know its a very similar approach to how codeNServiceKitServiceStackcode does their stuff but Im now totally decoupled from the web framework in use so in case a better one comes along I just implement another host and thats it.p  h1The situationh1  pIm currently working on an ASP.NET MVC site thats implementing the businesslogicview separation via the a hrefhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid92 relnofollowIQueryHandlera and a hrefhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid91 relnofollowICommandHandlera abstractions using a hrefhttpssimpleinjector.org relnofollowthe almighty SimpleInjectora for dependency injection.p  h1The Problemh1  pIve got to attach some custom validation logic to a codeQueryHandlercode via a decorator and thats working pretty well in and of itself. The problem is that in the event of validation errors I want to be able to show the same view that the action would have returned but with information on the validation error of course. Here is a sample for my casep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class HomeController  Controller      private readonly IQueryHandlerltSomeQuery, SomeTransportgt queryHandler      public ActionResult Index              try                      var dto  this.queryHandler.Handlenew SomeQuery   ...                Doing something awesome with the data ...             return this.Viewnew HomeViewModel                  catch ValidationException exception                      this.ModelState.AddModelErrorsexception             return this.Viewnew HomeViewModel                codepre  pIn this scenario I have some business logic thats handled by the codequeryHandlercode that is decorated with a codeValidationQueryHandlerDecoratorcode that throws codeValidationExceptioncodes when it is appropriate. p  h2What I want it to doh2  pWhat I want is something along the lines ofp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class HomeController  Controller      private readonly IQueryHandlerltSomeQuery, SomeTransportgt queryHandler      public ActionResult Index              var dto  this.queryHandler.Handlenew SomeQuery   ...            Doing something awesome with the data ...          There is a catchall in place for unexpected exceptions but          for ValidationExceptions I want to do essentially the same          view instantiation but with the model errors attached         return this.Viewnew HomeViewModel       codepre  pIve been thinking about a special codeValidationErrorHandlerAttributecode but then Im losing the context and I cant really return the proper view. The same goes with the approach where I just wrap the codeIQueryHandlerlt,gtcode with a decorator... Ive seen some strange pieces of code that did some string sniffing on the route and then instantiating a new controller and viewmodel via codeActivator.CreateInstancecode  that doesnt seem like a good idea.p  pSo Im wondering whether there is a nice way to do this ... maybe I just dont see the wood from the trees.

Negative 1263 pThe WordPress website I am debugging is used as an intern tool to publish reports.p  pWhen a user want to create a new report, they select the function, select the categories of informations they want to add, then at the bottom text boxes will be created with the right titles and people can then write the informations they have. When they click publish it posts a report with all the caterogies, with the title of each one followed by the info.p  pMy problem One of the categories, named emUrgences Environnementalesem, is showing correctly in the list of categories when creating a new report. If I click on it, it creates the text box at the bottom, but when I publish, its not in the report.p  pTo build the website, they used child themes. One is for the report.

Negative 1263 pIn my Meteor app I have some complex page animations that require a few seconds to complete instructive animations take priority over page transition speed. p  pTheres an emoutem state and an eminem state in the animation. For simplicitys sake, lets say I need to fade out one page, and then fade in the next, but that I want those fades to take multiple seconds. To do this I use Meteors Iron Router to call some animation functions that manipulate the CSS.p  pstronglibrouter.jsstrongp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodeanimateContentOut  functionpause      return content.removeClassanimated fadeIn  Router.onAfterActionanimateContentOut  animateContentIn  function      return content.addClassanimated fadeIn  Router.onAfterActionanimateContentIn codepre  pThis is based on a great tip from a hrefhttpwww.manuelschoebel.comblogsimplepagetransitionswithironrouterhooks relnofollowManuel Schoebela and the fadeIn works. However, my fade animation takes several seconds. So the user only sees the first few miliseconds of the fadeOut animation because it starts and then the router quickly navigates away to the new route before the animation completes.p  pSo my question, is how can I tell the router to wait for the animation to complete or for a setTimeout on an action in the onAfterAction call Is there a better hook to use when animating the process of leaving a pagep

Negative 1263 pMy question is very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6781545whyisfailbitwheneofonreadisthereawayouta previous onea.  I want to open and read a file.  I want exceptions thrown if the file cant be opened, but I dont want exceptions thrown on EOF.  fstreams seem to give you independent control over whether exceptions are thrown on EOF, on failures, and on other bad things, but it appears that EOF tends to also get mapped to the bad andor fail exceptions.p  pHeres a strippeddown example of what I was trying to do. The function f is supposed to return true if a file contains a certain word, false if it doesnt, and throw an exception if say the file doesnt exist.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  bool fconst char file      ifstream ifs     string word      ifs.exceptionsifstreamfailbit  ifstreambadbit     ifs.openfile      whileifs gtgt word          ifword  foo return true          return false   int mainint argc, char argv      try          bool r  fargv[1]         cout ltlt f returned  ltlt r ltlt endl      catch...          cerr ltlt exception ltlt endl       codepre  pBut it doesnt work, because basic fstream reading using operator is evidently one of the operations for which EOF sets the bad or the fail bit.  If the file exists and does not contain foo the function does not return false as desired, but rather throws an exception.p

Negative 1263 pI am working on Joomla 3.x I have a requirement to redirect to a new page after login. I know there is an option in Login Module under module manager, where in we can specify login Redirection Page. This is working perfectly fine. it is redirecting to the place where i wish to. p  pHowever, the issue is   Once User creates a new account  i have disabled the registration process, so no email links activation is required user is presented with a Login view not from module from component  comusers. Once credentials are supplied, instead of redirecting to the desired page i set in module manager, it goes to profile page of comusers component.  index.phpcomponentusersviewprofilep  pI need your suggestions to change this default behavior. Is there any place where i can set the redirection page for component comusers, similar to how we have for Login Module Do I need to go for Joomla core file coding changes Or Do i need to create Plugin which can fire after OnLoginUser eventp  pExpecting suggestion from you guys.p  pThanks and regards, Gaurav Pandyap
Negative 1263 pFirstly I shall note, my program needs only work on Linux, built with a modern version of GCC so portability concerns are not terribly relevant here the software is already using highly platform specific features for low level hardware functionality.p  pI have been having a problem by which I have a number of processes, a parent and some children. The parent has the receiving end of a POSIX message queue and the children each have a sending end. The children are in effect receiving messages over a network details irrelevant here and sending them to the parent which then processes the data and stores it. This is working fine for the vast majority of my use case.p  pHowever I have just had to add functionality by which clients over the network need to request small amounts of data as well as just sending it however sending will still be the main case.p  pMy initial plan was to use the codepipecode syscall in the child when it received this neq type of request and have it send a special message to the parent requesting the parent open the pipe and send some data back to the child. However this approach was cut short when I discovered that file descriptors can only be sent over domain sockets and not message queues.p  pI then realized while playing with a bash shell that it is possible to use procpidofchildfdpipefd where pidofchild is the PID of the child process and pipefd is the file descriptor of the write end of the pipe in the child to grab the childs pipe without it having to send it to us.p  pSo, my current plan is to have the child send its PID and the file descriptor of the write end of its pipe down the message queue to the parent, the parent can then open the pipe through the proc filesystem, write the message to the child and then close it again.p  pHowever, looking online I have not been able to find a single case of anyone using this technique for IPC in any program whatsoever so am becoming concerned that there is some huge caveat which I have not considered and is going to make this whole plan fail, what are the concerns I need be aware of when opening another processes pipe through the procxfdy interfacep  pHere is a snippet of my current code note error checking is removed for shortness, also irrelevant lines are removedp  precode Parent Code  static inline void ParentFuncvoid      struct EasySMessage IncomingMQMessage  mallocMQMESSAGESIZE  1      ssizet MQueueMesSize  mqreceiveGlobalsgtEasySMQueue         , IncomingMQMessage, MQMESSAGESIZE  1, NULL     switchIncomingMQMessagegtOpType              case WriteMessage              Process and write the message               SNIP              break         case ReadMessage             char  MyString  FormatProcFDStringIncomingMQMessage             OpenPipeAndReplyIncomingMQMessage, MyString             break         default             printfUnrecognised easys message type dn                 , IncomingMQMessagegtOpType             exit1          freeIncomingMQMessage    Child Code  static int ChildCodemqdt EasySChildMQueue, struct EasySMessage MessageProcessed      sizet SizeToSend  SizeOfMessageMessageProcessed     int Pipes[2]     pipePipes     MessageProcessedgtPipe  Pipes[1]     MessageProcessedgtPid  getpid     mqsendEasySChildMQueue, MessageProcessed, SizeToSend, 0     ReadFromPipeAndReplyPipes     return 0  codepre

When it gets the codeeditorcode class, its padding is set to 0, and both the codelttdgtcode and codeltinputgtcode have codeboxsizing borderboxcode, but the width of the column still increases.p  pSo does codewidth 100code not mean 100 of the width of the codelttdgtcode as it is at the time Or is it just not possible to make this work using CSS only I could probably use a backbone event to get the size of the td and then set the input to the same size but that sounds a bit hacky.p

Given that this check would need to then determine if the new position also overlaps, its becoming a bit too complicated for my skill level selftaught beginner.p  pI have researched this extensively, and Ive come across the following VBA codep  precodeApplication.ScreenUpdating  False Dim wb As Workbook Set wb  ActiveWorkbook Dim sh As Worksheet Set sh  wb.ActiveSheet Dim s1 As Shape Dim s2 As Shape     Dim CheckOverlap As Boolean  For i  1 To 10 sh.Shapes.Count If i lt sh.Shapes.Count Then         Set s1  sh.Shapesi         CheckOverlap  False         For Each s2 In WorksheetsPlan.Shapes                     If s2.Left lt s1.Left  s1.Width And s2.Top lt s1.Top  s1.Height Then                         CheckOverlap  True                         Exit For                     End If          Next     If CheckOverlap  True Then         s2.Top  s2.Top  30         End If End If Next End Sub codepre  pI found the basis of the code herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5158128hittestingandresolvingocclusionofautoshapesinexcel51620255162025HitTesting and Resolving Occlusion of AutoShapes in Excelap  pHowever, I havent been able to figure it out how to make it check whether overlap occurs vertically as well as horizontally, as well as the multipleoverlap problem.  Currently, if I execute that code, it just moves every shape down even irrespective of whether it overlaps.p  pIf someone could help me out I would really appreciate it  This is the hardest part of my project and Id love to find a solution.p  pMany thanks for your helpp

Negative 1263 h1Questionh1  pI am trying to perform a number of polygon clips using the gIntersection function with R in a loop. I can obtain the correct clips and reenter data manually so I can turn the resulting SpatialPolygons object back into a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object.

I have 9 English regions with London, so its not a huge challenge to set each clip up manually.

Negative 1263 pIs there a way in VB.netVBA to search for a string in a .doc file without physically opening itp  pThe question may sound silly but I have code that searches 100s of documents at a time while opening them all up onebyone using codeFor Eachcode, codeFileSystemObjectcodeand codeoWord.Document.OpenFilename.doccode and it takes ages. p  pI noticed that when you search for a document using the search box in Windows Explorer, the results are returned having found your search term in the TITLE of the document as well as the the CONTENTS of the document within the search window. The results where the search term was found INSIDE the document appears as a sort of text preview of all the text inside that document.I could be wrong but I read somewhere that all word documents contain some sort of xml file embedded within that contains among other things the text from the document itself.p  pSo my question is, if Windows Explorer can do it without having to open a word process, can the same be done in code VBA or VB.NETto find a particular word inside a documentp  pHope that makes sense, p  pThanks.p

Negative 1263 pI have made a drupal 7 module recently and I want to customise the way drupal show validation errors. I want to place error message in a popup. And I put the popup generation code in form alter hook.p  pBut I cannot make drupal hookformalter run after validation hook. I have tried to clear the form cache and tried to use afterbuild instead of form alter hook, but they are all run before the validation.

Negative 1263 pI came across the calling conventions of C and by default the arguments are passed from right to left. So as per that first a will be passed that is the value 2 will be passed and also the value of a is now is 2 and after that a will be passed which is 3 and the value of a will now be 3 and in the last a will be passed. My question is when a and a have already  been passed the value of a has been changed to 3.

Negative 1263 pSo im just asking for a general advice. I have a web app consisting ofp  ul liASP.NET webforms project which also has jQuery dialogsli liDomain Layer  Business Logicli liDataAccessLayer li liWebService classli ul  pNow the way i have designed this project is that when a read routine is called from the client jquery ajax, the client calls a webservice method, which then calls my data access layer methods, the DAL returns a datatable to my web service method, the web service method then creates the relevant Business Logic class from the returned DAL object which is then returned to the jquery ajax method as a response. p  pIs this the right routine or should it be this way, the client calls a webservice method, the web service method creates a business logic class, the Business Logic class calls the DAL which returns a DAL object to the Business Logic Class, which then returns an updated Business Logic class to the Webservice and finally returning it to the client as jqeury ajax responsep

Negative 1263 pI m using Oracle HTTP Server as reverse proxy for WebLogic.  I have set up SSL on both the proxy and the server with client certificate authentication.  It works and the clients get authenticated by OHS, but i need to pass client certificate information to WebLogic so i can look at this certificate in my servlet.  Documentation says that the proxy can forward client certificate within WLProxyClientCert http header to the WebLogic server.p  pHowever, i cant get this to work.  Within my servlet i tried both request.getHeader and request.getAttribute and getting null.  I looked at both headers and attributes of the request objects and dont see anything like WLProxyClientCert.  In fact i dont see any headers starting with WL, only couple of headers starting with XWebLogic, none of which has the certificate.p  pI did enable Client Cert Proxy Enabled option in Administration Console as described in the docs.  Also i know that clients get authenticated since i see the certificate requested by the browser, after which i can successfully access the site.p  pAm i missing somethingp

Negative 1263 pIs there any implementation or specification for including a hash or signature in an attribute of a ltscript tag, so that the browser can verify that the correct file was retrieved before executing it Something likep  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript   srchttpcdn.example.comjquery2001.js   signaturesha256e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 gtltscriptgt codepre  pThe motivation is this generally, each additional CDN or host you use for your site increases your vulnerability, by adding a new target that can be hacked to compromise your site. Allowing your primary frontend servers to assert hashes or signatures of those files could entirely eliminate that risk, allowing you to be more flexible when designing your architecture. You could even request missing files from an untrusted peertopeer network.p  pI thought I remembered a specification about this, but havent been able to find it.p

The idea is to replace some values within the xml tags contained in each block and rewrite the file, maintaining the original content BUT with the new values within the tags. For this part, an example is as follows. Within a shell script, I am parsing the log file and as I come across the APPLICATION tags, I want to mask the values of any tag that has an SSN in it with .

Negative 1263 pIm creating a 3D game in Unity 5 but would like to use 2D sprites for certain parts. Im quite new to Unity, so I might be missing something obvious.

Negative 1263 pI was playing around the other day with codeRetrofitcode with codeAndroidcode and it lead me to ponder on how to handle codeCallbackcode hell. I read through numerous articles on ways to keep track of codemultithreadedcode responses and I ended up reading things about coderxjavacode with coderetrofitcode.p  pHeres my situationp  pLets say I have 1 text box that I want to populate upon receiving a response. I fire off two codeHTTP GETcode requests concurrently that call the same endpoint but will yield me 2 different results. While waiting for the response, I decide to click on other events that fire off other requests that call to different end points to change the color of my background. Now since my requests are being fired concurrently, theres no way of telling which request will actually return first. To better visualise the situationp  precodeRequest1GET for textbox1 gtRESPONSE  Finishes last  Request2GET for textbox1 gt RESPONSE               Finishes first  Request3GET for textbox2 gt RESPONSE     Finishes second codepre  pNow lets say codeRequest2code contains the string codeCATcode and since it finishes first, it will populate the field of my codetextbox1code as codeCATDOGcode with codeDOGcode being the return value from codeRequest1code, but in reality, I want the codetextbox1code to populate with codeDOGCATcode. How will I know from which context these responses are coming from This is when I went into RxJava because I thought it would be the answer to this problem with concurrency.p  pI created a simple codeGETcode call to try my luckp  precode apiService.getFeedtext         .subscribeOnSchedulers.newThread             .observeOnAndroidSchedulers.mainThread             .subscribenew SubscriberltListltAnimalgtgt                  Override                 public void onCompleted                                     Override                 public void onErrorThrowable e                                     Override                 public void onNextListltAnimalgt response                      animals  response                               codepre  pHere is my servicep  precodeGETfindidanimal rx.ObservableltListltAnimalgtgt getFeedPathidString id codepre  pNow as well as this works on returning me a response, Im not quite sure how these codeObservablescode work entirely. Just by using rx, am I free from Callback hell Or do I still have to handle the returns. How do I ensure that I have a track of all my responses so I know exactly who fired the requests and when Is this all to it Am I already in the clearp

Negative 1263 pI have a UISplitViewController whose secondary detail VC is a UICollectionViewController. I want the cells of the collection to resize based on changes to the size and aspect of the collection view. I trigger this resizing by overriding the UIContentContainer protocol methodp  precode MARK  UIContentContainer protocol methods  override func viewWillTransitionToSizesize CGSize, withTransitionCoordinator coordinator UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator      setFlowLayoutItemSizeForViewSizesize     collectionViewLayout.invalidateLayout  codepre  pThis is called and works just how I want when the device rotates but this method is emnotem being called when the button supplied by splitViewController.displayModeButtonItem is pressed to show or collapse the primary master view controller.

Negative 1263 pI am currently working on a project that uses a framework that is based on swing. My goal is to add a JavaFX component to this project, but I am having some problems with modal dialogs.p  pOverall my problem can be simplified as follows p  pSwing I have a codeJFramecode containing a button. When I press this button, I want to open a dialog containing some JavaFX code. This new dialog should block and always be on top of the frame.p  pJavaFX Here I also have a button. When I press this button, I want to display an codeAlertcode which should block the Dialog and therefore also the Swing JFrame.p  pCurrently my solution is to use a codeJDialogcode containing a codeJFXPanelcode as glue so overall my logic is as followsp  ul liThe codeJFramecode contains a button that opens a new codeJDialogcodeli liThis codeJDialogcode contains a codeJFXPanelcode which contains a JavaFX codeScenecode containing a JavaFX codeButtoncodeli liPressing this JavaFX codeButtoncode opens an codeAlertcodeli ul  pThe code is in the bottom of this post.p  pCurrently the codeJDialogcode works as expected. It blocks the parent frame and is always on top of it.p  pThe JavaFX codeDialogcode on the other hand, doesnt work quite as expected. It does block the JavaFX codeScenecode I am not able to press the button multiple times, but it has some problems with the codeJDialogcode. These are p  ol liIt is not always on top of it. I am able to bring the codeJDialogcode on front of my alertli liIt doesnt block it. I am able to close the codeJDialogcode using the Xli ol  pMy own theory is that the problem is the relation between the codeJDialogcode and the codeJFXPanelcode.

Negative 1263 pI am writing a CashSystem for a small Cafe, using a Raspberry 2 Raspbian OS, a Touchscreen and an RFID Reader.p  pI want to get completely rid of a keyboard and mouse. So all user interactions have to happen with touchscreen or RFID. Every employee has its own RFID chip and should be able to start the Cashsystem from console without having to type sh startcash.sh oslt.p  pThe Raspberry starts directly to a bash without password oslt. The cashsystem is written in JavaFX so no X Server is permitted. When I place the RFID over the reader, the tagnumberenter is written onto the console, which seems pretty handy here. But I cannot manage to write a shellscript with the name of the rfid number, which then starts, without typing a sh before the rfid number which is not possible without a keyboard.p  pSo lets assume I have two different rfid tags 1 and 2 and two different shellscripts A and B. What do I need to do, that rfid 1 starts script A and rfid 2 starts script Bp

When I change language of my store from the front controller i.e. my module page at front end, then page reloads but the module is not translated to the new language.p  pAnd when I do the same on home page or any other page and then move to my module page, the module is translated properly as expected.p  pThis issue is coming on Prestashop v1.5 only, it is working fine on v1.6p  pEven if I print the context variable for language the language is updated there as well, but my module page is not translated.p
