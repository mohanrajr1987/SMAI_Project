Positive 1533 pI have created a class that handles encrypted database traffic.  I have used external Event definitions successfully, allowing the calling process to properly handle errors that  while they occurred within the database module  actually originated from the calling procedure.p  pUsing the external Error handler I would do the followingp  precodepublic event EventHandler ErrorStatusChanged codepre  p...and later, ifwhen such occurred, I would handle it like thisp  precodeif ErrorStatusChanged  null           ErrorStatusChangedthis, EventArgs.Empty     codepre  p...and that seems to work just fine.  However, now I want to extend further using a callback function, but I have only a few clues how I might approach this situation.  I feel sure that it is possible to accomplish this, but Im fairly lostconfused as to actual implementation...p  pSomething likep  precodepublic delegate void UpdateSystemStatus bool dbConnected, string textStatus codepre  p...and then later Im sure Ive got this wrong, the compiler flags it even before compile timep  precodeif UpdateSystemStatus  null            UpdateSystemStatusbConnFlag, sConnTextStatus     codepre  pId like to build a couple of callbacks  one that allows the datahandler class to inform the calling process that it has successfully connected or not, and another to handle updating a progress bar during the longer massupdate processes.  And after numerous searches using [callback] andor [delegate] as keywords, Im getting nowhere quickly.  I am, however, getting emreallyem confusedp  pI had envisioned that I would provide some sort of interface, very similar to the EventHander above and be able to determine  later on, when it is needed  whether the calling procedure provided the proper function, and call it ifwhen possible.  I know that not all programmers will want to provide a main form update callback function to this database handler, so I figure Ill need to somehow know when one has been provided, and when not.p  pI have unsuccessfully employed the [delegate] keyword, and have no idea how to use the [interface] directive at all  all of the examples I keep running into illustrate the functions being internal to the class, which is exactly not what I am trying to achieve.  I am trying to provide a framework that will allow an external process to provide a function that, when something happens inside the classobject that would be good to update the external calling system, could do so by calling the provided function from outside.p  pThanks in advance for your assistance  Im lostp

Positive 1533 pIm aware of the reiterative kind of questions about this topic, but I still cant find a proper answer anywhere.p  pThe view controller that receives data implements the delegate method and sets the delegate to self.

Negative 1533 h2Original title How can I prevent loading a native dll from a .NET apph2  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pMy C application includes a plugin framework and generic plugin loader.p  pThe plugin loader enumerates the application directory in order to identify plugin dlls essentially it searches for .dll at this time. p  pWithin the same application directory is a native Windows, non.net dll, which, indirectly, one of the plugin dlls depends upon.p  pThe plugin loader blindly assumes that the native.dll is a .NET Assembly dll, simply because it only checks the file extension. When it attempts to load the native dll, an exception is thrownp  pCould not load file or assembly native.dll or one of its dependencies. The module was expected to contain an assembly manifest.p  pI basically create a diagnostic report if plugin loading fails, so Im trying to avoid having this log filled up with messages about not being able to load the native dll which I dont even want to attempt.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pIs there some .NET API call that I can use to determine whether a binary happens to be a .NET assembly so that I dont attempt to load the native dll at allp  pPerhaps longer term I will move my plugins to a subdirectory, but for now, I just want a work around that doesnt involve hardcoding the native.dll name inside my plugin loader. p  pI guess Im looking for some kind of static Assembly.IsManaged API call that Ive overlooked.... presumably no such API existsp

Negative 1533 pLets say Im building feed of comments and need the comment data and user data of the author. Comments are represented by the codeCommentcode class. Users are represented by the codeUsercode class. When pulling the comments, the codeauthorcode member of codeCommentcode should be set to an instance of codeUsercode to keep all the info about the author.p  precodeclass Comment     var id    var body    var timestamp    var etc    var authorid    var author a user instance    static function fromArraymembers ...   class User     var id    var username    var haspicture    var etc    static function fromArraymembers ...   codepre  h2How im doing it now...h2  pThe way ive been doing it so far is by joining the tables and only pulling the basic user data I need... and if any column names collide, I set an alias codefield AS somethingelsecode. Heres the basic lookp  precodequery  mysqlquerySELECT c., u.username AS authorusername, u.haspicture AS authorhaspicture FROM comments c JOIN user u ON u.id  c.authorid while row  mysqlfetcharrayquery, MYSQLASSOC    comment  CommentfromArrayrow  codepre  pTo create codeauthorcode... the Comment codefromArraycode method thats fed with each row looks like thisp  precodestatic function fromArraymembers      foreachmembers as field gt value         thisgtfield  value          thisgtauthor  UserfromArrayarray         id gt row[authorid],         username gt row[authorusername],         haspicture gt row[authorhaspicture]       codepre  h2So heres my questionh2  pAm I missing something Theres got to be a better way of doing it. This way seems so inflexible and prone to breaking when tables change or a codeUsercode method changes and ends up needing a field thats not provided by the query.  A separate query for each user cant be an option... can itp  phr p  pp.s. keep in mind that the User object is a bit more complex than that, and it has many more methods that are called later on when the comments are displayed. It cant be reasonably flattened and treated as an array. An OO setup is pretty necessary.p
Negative 1533 pI have a servlet filter that is generating Exceeded stated content length errors in WebLogic 10.0. I would appreciate any suggestions to fix this issue please.

Negative 1533 pSo Im looking into writing some custom MVC extensions and the first one Im attempting to tackle is a FormattedTextBox to handle things such as currency, dates, and times. I have the rendering of it working perfectly, formatting it, working with strong types and everything all golden. However, the problem Im now running into is cleaning up the formatted stuff when the page posts the data back.p  pTake for example, a currency format. Lets use USD for these examples. When an object has a property as a decimal, the value would be code79.95code. Your edit view would be something likep  precodelt Html.FormattedTextBoxmodel gt Model.Person.HourlyWage, 0C gt codepre  pThis is all well and good for the GET request, but upon POST, the value is going to be code79.95code, which when you assign to that decimal, gets unhappy very quickly and ends up shoving a code0code in there.p  pSo my question is, how do I get code working somewhere to work with that value before the MVC Framework goes and starts shoving it back into my ViewModel Id much rather this be done serverside than clientside.p  pThanksp

Negative 1533 pOur team is willing to unittest a new code written under a running project extending an existing huge Oracle system.p  pThe system is written solely in PLSQL, consists of thousands of tables, hundreds of stored procedures packages, mostly getting data from tables andor insertingupdating other data.p  pOur extension is not an exception. Most functions return data from a quite complex SELECT statementa over many mutually bound tables with a little added logic before returning them or make transformation from one complicated data structure to another complicated in another way.p  pWhat is the best approach to unittest such codep  pThere are no unit tests for existing code base. To make things worse, only packages, triggers and views are sourcecontrolled, table structures including alter table stuff and necessary data transformations are deployed via channel other than version control. There is no way to change this within our projects scope.p  pMaintaining testing data set seems to be impossible since there is new code deployed to the production environment on weekly basis, usually without prior notice, often changing data structure add a column here, remove one there.p  pId be glad for any suggestion or reference to help us. Some team members tend to be tired by figuring out how to even start for our experience with unittesting does not cover PLSQL data intensive legacy systems only those fromthebook greenfield Java projects.p

Negative 1533 pI have a need to spawn a window that will hover just above my main window in a cocoa application. I want this main window to allow the user to enter some text in an input box.

Negative 1533 pIve been driving myself crazy over the past few days over this one.  Weve just finished setting up a Hudson ContinuousIntegration server.  So it runs a build script each and every commit to validate the commit.  The issue is that it validates that all the files in the repo have both the codesvnkeywords  Idcode and codesvneolstyle  LFcode properties set on all code.phpcode files, which normally would be great The last time I did this, I used Eclipse and Tortoise SVN, which both have svnadd functionality. p  pBut the problem is that Ive grown quite accustomed to Netbeans.  And Netbeans has no codesvn addcode function that I can find It add files automatically upon commit.  The problem is that I cant add the properties until the files are added.  If I commit without adding the properties, the build will fail.  So I wind up failing the build every other commit because I need to take 5 steps commit, recursive propset, commit, acknowledge failed build, delete failed build,  to do something that would normally only take 2 propset, commit.p  pI dont really want to go back to Eclipse at this point, but when it takes me 20 minutes to commit because I need to do everything 4 times, its going to get old quickly...  Is there some workaround that Im missing Short of removing the property check, which will defeat the point, since I want those properties set anyway  Or am I just SOL...p

Negative 1533 pI have a win forms client that accesses a wcf service for a long running operation. The service exposes subscribe and unsubscribe methods. When a client calls the subscribe method, service generates new guid for it and gets the current callback context, saves this guid and callback context in a client Dictionary and returns the Guid. On user request, client call service with this guid to start the long operation. Once the service finishes the operation it gives a callback to the client. the client then retrieves the processed data from the service.p  pThe error I get sometimes when doing a callback is p  blockquote   pThe operation OnServiceCallback could not be completed because the sessionful channel timed out waiting to receive a message.

Negative 1533 pIm writing a small program in Python on Linux that will intercept packets flying over the wire on specific port from host A to host B.

How can I achieve this using intercepted packets with pcapyimpacket brbr It may be a little fuzzy, but the main idea is presented below.br 1. Host A sends Hello to host B host A and B are arp spoofed so that traffic goes through host C. br 2. Host C gets the Hello from host A by default host C redirects Hello to host B, but I want something else  see point 3br 3. Host C modifies the Hello to Bye and redirects kernels ipforward to host B.br 4.

Negative 1533 pIve some experience developing Java programs. However I have always struggled to understand some basics, such as all the different components that make up a Java Enterprise Application.p  pFor example I have implemented RESTful and SOAP based Web services that are consumed from a J2ME application and performed performance and costing tests for my MSC. p  pTo develop the RESTfulSOAP based Web services, I used the wizard functionality in Netbeans. It uses JAXRS to implement the REST web services. Then I see other tutorials that use JAXRS with Jersey etc. I often get lost in the jargon such as APIs, application frameworks, configuration files, Java edition and so on etc. Here are a few questionsp  ol lipstrongJAXRSstrong is an API.  Is an API basically a collection of libraries used to implement some form of functionality in Java pli lipAccording to their site strongemJerseystrong is the open source, production quality, JAXRS JSR 311 Reference Implementation for building RESTful Web services.em Is Jersey another API or is it used in conjunction with JAXRS, and whats the difference between the two  pli lipHow do I recognise if in fact I have implemented such APIs and know if I need thempli ol  pWhen I decided to implement RESTful web services, I just followed a Netbeans tutorial and the wizards provided easy and quick development time. I understand that wizards are used because they are quick and do the job. However I wonder, when you are given a task to code. How do you know what APIs, frameworks, addons etc to use. What edition of Java is compliant with the libraries etc. Is it just me or do you get lost at times Or will this come from experience. p  pThanks for taking the time to read p

Negative 1533 pI operate a small development cluster and repository system for a couple of opensource project groups to use. I run these systems on a volunteer basis. Recently, people have expressed concern at the repository system using basic authentication to access the SVN repository system, so Im transitioning the whole system over to digest authentication. The thing is that I have a number of utilities written around the basic scheme so that each person can change their own SVN password as they wish.p  pIn a nutshell, Im looking for a Perl module that will quickly allow me to add, delete, and modify entries into an htdigest generated password file. I would ideally like something similar to the a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgdistApacheHtpasswd relnofollowApacheHtpasswda module. I have read that you can use one of the encryption modules to generate a digested password then write that using the htpasswd module, but I have no idea how to actually implement that solution.

Negative 1533 pHaving spent the last 5 hours trying to install PEAR Im somewhat at a loss for what to try next. The initial gopear.phar running from the command line produces the following errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwX2dI.png althttpimgur.comiHKSZp  pI can install the PEAR files from the package, but this doesnt include the pear.bat file and other registration files. I cant use the web installer because it puts the package manager in my www directory, and if I try moving the files the path variables all fail to work again. Ive searched Google for ages and nowhere can you download the files on their own everything is just circular references getting back to gopear.phar, which does not work. Ive tried using older PHP versions 5.2.9 without effect.p  pThe system is running through EasyPHP on Windows 7 64 bit, account is a single account administrator, UAC is disabled. Can someone zip up the PEAR files and host them somewhere so that I can get hold of them to install manually, as this would be the quickest way to solve the issuesp

If it has not changed, nothing happens. Would there be any CPU issues with that.p

Negative 1533 pI have two classes, one which is hardwaredependent and one which is not lets call them HardwareDependent and HardwareIndependent respectively.  The Hardware dependent class extends the hardware independent class.  Now I have another class which at least must be an extension of the HardwareIndependent, but I would prefer it to be an extension of HardwareDependent when possible so it may leverage the additional functionality.  Is there a possibility of using reflection or something else to accomplish this  Or is this a total technical impossibility  I suppose if all else fails, I could write the class twice, but it seems to me that is an ineffective approach.

Negative 1533 pI have a form that, when you enter text into a field and tab off, a jQuery event is triggered to validate that field by calling the relevant controller action. For example, I have an AccountController and a ValidateField action. When the user tabs off of the Username field, it will send a request to AccountValidateField. I will then return a JSON result back based on the validation. p  pOk, so lets say I want to validate a Username field. I want to check that enough characters were used, that the username isnt already in use, and that the characters used are allowed. Two of these are easy. However, I need access to the database to check if the username already exists. p  pWhere would I put this logic In the Service layerp

Negative 1533 pSAS programmers at my company work with researchers to analyze data stored in a number of text files around 1Tb in size.  The resulting SAS processes can take days to run.

Negative 1533 pI have been researching FRP and found a bunch of different implementations. One model I have seen is one I will refer to as the Signal representation. This essential combines Events and Behaviours into one entity. p  pFirstly, a Signal is an object thats value is a Behaviour. Secondly, a Signal has an Event stream that can be seen and operated on as a standard data structure you can use each, map and filter etc on the Signal to define how Events are reacted to. For example I can do this where time is a Signal representation of timep  precodetime.each  t gt printt   every time there is a tick the current time is printed a  time  5 where a would be a dynamic value always up to date with time codepre  pIs this representation of FRP correct or are there any problems I quite like the way this works and also how simple it is to describe personally but Im not sure its right.p

Negative 1533 pLooking for a good SQLite Lua library. I found a hrefhttplua.sqlite.orgindex.cgidircitip relnofollowLuaSQLite3a but trying to figure out how to use it in Lua. Ive created DLLs to expose functions to Lua before with RakNet a networking library, but cant see how this SQLite would work. This seems to be setup to compile for nonWindows machines and I would need it for Windows. I can create a DLL but not following how it works. p  pThe examples that come with it simply say requirelsqlite3 at the top of the files, but I dont know where that Lua file is. The C code would create the DLL that I would expect that lsqlite3 would load in because Im pretty sure coderequirecode doesnt load a DLL as when I did my RakNet DLL I had to use codepackage.loadcode I believe it was. So lsqlite3 must be a Lua file, but I dont see it in the downloaded package. Maybe Im blind p  pAny ideasp  pI pulled the C source file into a new Visual Studio Express 2010 DLL project. Brought in Lua source and sqlite source and compiled the DLL. That worked all well and so I have a lsqlite3.dll file. When I put coderequirelsqlite3code in my Lua project I get an error from Lua saying it cant open the file. The file is in the same dir as my lua interpreter.p

Negative 1533 pIm very new to Java programming, and this is actually part of a problem I need to solve for homework I am reading the contents of a file line by line as a String into an ArrayList for later processing.

Negative 1533 pI am trying to find out if specific hosts on my network are reachable. My java code is as followsp  precodeInetAddress adr  InetAddress.getByNamehost ifadr.isReachable3000     System.out.printlnhost   is reachable  codepre  pThis works quite well, however if I lower the timeout to say 500ms instead, it will not designate the host reachable anymore. I plan to check quite a few hosts in a loop, so having a low timeout is quite important.

Negative 1533 pIm trying to build both 32bit and 64bit installers using WiX, and part of that requires a DLL that runs during the InstallUISequence to check a value typed in by the user.  I used Visual Studio 2010 and the WiX plugin to generate a DLL template and filled it in. Everything works fine when I built the DLL for 32bit.  When I build it for 64bit, there are complaints about missing symbols WcaFinalize and WcaGlobalFinalize.p  pIve read in various discussions from 34 years ago that there first was no build of WiX to support 64bit custom actions, then there was a special Wix35x64.msi, then that was withdrawn, with the explanation that 32bit WiX could build 64bit installers.p  pDoes WiX 3.5 or 3.6 support building 64bit DLLs for inclusion in 64bit installers  If so, where do I find the libraries that include WcaFinalize and WcaGlobalFinalize for 64bitp

Instead of implementing complicated interlocking that I have no good way to test, I can just declare another temp variable the writer thread will write to. Then when the reader is finished with one batch, it can atomically propagate the temp value to the actual variable. Would that be raceconditionfreep

Negative 1533 pI am working with the Todos example application a hrefhttpsgithub.comdocumentcloudbackbonebundled with the latest version of Backbonea 0.9.2 while learning about Backbone.js.

In this case, nothing is being changed, but render is being called twice.p  pAgain, I am just learning Backbone, so I may have a basic misunderstanding that is leading to my confusion.p

Negative 1533 pI have an unmanaged C DLL originally written in MSVC 6.0.  It has a couple classes and a few standalone C functions which I need to call from C .NET 4.0.  I have had several false starts on this.  I know there are several ways to do this Convert to COM, MC wrapper, PInvoke but it hasnt been entirely clear which is the most straightforward.  My current approach is to convert the C DLL to ActiveX control.  The issue Ive run into is that when trying to recreate the methods in a VS 2010 C ActiveX project the Class Wizard does not allow any return types except fundamental types, CString or pointer to CWnd.  How do I return either a copy of a structure or a pointer to a structure  It doesnt seem possible to return as a parameter either since the types for the method parameters have the same type limitations as the return type.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlvDdr.png altAllowed ActiveX Return Typesp

Negative 1533 pIm using Drupal 7, with the Views, Feeds and Views PHP modules among others, but I think those are the only relevant ones.p  pMy goal is a single view that combines a multiple RSS feeds brought in through the Feeds module, b two or three content types of my own, for contant created manually on my site. The result will be a block and a page that has a stream of all my latest work, wherever it is  my own site or another site as long as that other site has an RSS feed, of course.p  pThe ideal result would show a single list, sorted by date, mingling the items without regard for content type.p  pMy problem The Feeds module and my custom content types have different date fields. My content types have a field called Original Date, which I set when I create content eg, adding an article I wrote three years ago  I clearly want it to be sorted by when it was published, not when I added it to the site. However, each feeditem has a date field, Published Date, that corresponds to the date in the RSS feed and is received with the rest of the item by RSS.p  pI have tried to use the Views PHP functionality to use ifthen statements, in a variety of ways. For example, I check what the contenttype is, and then set a variable to either the Original Date or by the Published Date, depending on the content type. Alternatively, I have tested whether the Original Date field is set if so, I return that field, otherwise I return the Published Date field. They all fail in various ways. Most throw PHP errors that are visible even to anonymous users obviously a problem.p  pI have tried these various approaches directly in the Sort Criterial section of Views Ive also tried to come up with the date in the Fields section, and then have a Sort criterion call that result. Ive converted everything to a Unix timestamp, to make sure I have something simple to sort by Ive tried leaving dates as dates. No luck any which way.p  pHeres the emreallyem weird part I have successfully used these approaches to emdisplayem the correct date, so that for example the block shows TITLE  Original Date for custom content types, and  TITLE  Published Date for feed items. But when I try the same approaches to sort by date, it fails.p  pAm I overlooking something simpler Do I have to use PHP Views Is there some other way to sort a View of multiple content types by a combination of two different though similar fieldsp  pThanksp  ptfp

Negative 1533 pIm creating a turn based game for the iPhone that contains animations between turns, and I want to wait on the [UIView animateWithDuration...] method call inline in code. Is there a way to make this call synchronously instead of asynchronously Currently what I am doing is... p  precode Some code...   NSConditionLock conditionLock  [[NSConditionLock alloc] initWithCondition0]  dispatchsyncdispatchgetmainqueue,      [UIView animateWithDuration1                       animations                           some animation                                             completionBOOL finished                          [conditionLock lock]                          [conditionLock unlockWithCondition1]                       ]      forces thread to wait until completion block is called [conditionLock lockWhenCondition1]     More code...  codepre  pTherefore in the above code,  More code... is only reached after the animation has completely finished. Obviously this code must run on a secondary thread, and it works as I want to. However, I have a feeling that using an NSConditionLock in combination with gcd is bad form and blocking the secondary thread in this way is not optimal for performance. Is my current code alright, or is there a better way to do this Thanks. p  pEdit  The key point is that  more code... is inline, and not in the completion block.  Really what I want to know, is it alright to use NSConditionLocks in combination with GCD, and if not whats the better way p

Negative 1533 pI did some research on texture grids in java today as I thought it was time to stop using a different image file for every texture I needed in a game. Well, this lead to nothing. What I mean by a texture grid, for an example, is the textures.png of minecraft. This is a grid of small images but somehow in the code they are distinguished, and I want to know, how Thanks in advance for helpp  pEdit For example, there may be a 100 by 100 pixel image, but that image may contain 25 20pixel images, and then in the game each of those images would be used as a specific texture, so rather than having sand.png, stone.png, etc, each in a separate file, they all would be in one image just examples. My question isnt about how I would apply a texture so much as how I would store all the textures in one image file, and then use the data from that image file.p

Negative 1533 pIve been happily compiling and going my merry way with Xcode 4.3.2 IOS5.1. Now that Ive taken the plunge and decided to move to Xcode 4.5 my App fails compilation in a most miserable manner. Now, Ive not got past the issue with ARMV7 or anything like that yet. No. My issue is probably going to make many of you groan. p  pBut you can blame my basic ANSI C days for that. Everyone likes reusable code and Ive created lots of it. BUT Ive not made any of this particular code into objects per se. That is, Ive not taken the steps of the Interface and Implementation to heart. p  pSure, I have my classes for my view controllers etc. But, to save having to strongdeclarestrong and strongallocstrong eminitem objects so I can use the methods therein, Ive simply dumped a load of methods into a .inc file  in other words an include file. E.g, Id have a method for altering the background colour or background image a of a table cell  and Id import the file that had the method that did it.p  pE.g.p  precodevoiddefaultInactiveBackGroundForCellUITableViewCell cell      cell.backgroundView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage[[UIImage imageNamedDEFAULTINACTCELLBACKGROUNDIMAGE] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth0.0 topCapHeight5.0]]    defaultInactiveBackGroundForCell codepre  pAll well and good so far.p  pAnd, Id import the file containing the above code at the top of my class file, my .m file. In my willDisplayCell delegate method, id simply call the following methodp  precode[self defaultInactiveBackGroundForCellcell] codepre  pAnd itd work.p  pBut under Xcode 4.5 its kicking off big timep  pMissing contact for method in declaration.p  pSo, my question is Is there any way at all of importing code into a class .m fill like we used to do in the old days with ANSI Cp  pHelp p

Adding a prototype of initialize works the only issue is if initialize is passed with the model it overrides it via the underscore extend method.p  pI tried thisp  precodeBackbone.Model.prototype.constructor  functionattributes, opts          console.loghi         Backbone.Model.prototype.constructor.callthis, attributes  codepre  ponly problem is, it doesnt work outside of the extend it will only get called if constructor is inside the object you extend the model with when creating a new instance.p  pI just need to run some code when an instance of each model is created. I want to perform some auto binding work with nodes socket.io framework.p

Negative 1533 pIve got unity3d and vuforia app ported to Eclipse. I have one starting activity and one extended activity which does extend vuforia activity and is set up as MAIN activity in manifest.p  pIve got some app initializing activities like GA tracing session open and checking version of new app by requesting my own server.p  pMy problem is that I cant manage to run these init stuff only once in app life cycle.p  pWhen app starts, it loads first Extended activity which loads vuforia and unity scene while showing splash screen, then when it is ready it goes to startup activity where it show some info to user. User reads it and then by tapping goes again to unity activity to get 3d scene.  I can put this initialization in either Extended activity or to start up activity. Both are valid from functional point of view. But what ever I do when user navigates between start up activity and unity activity previous activity is destroyed and next time onCreate is called when going back to it. It happens in both of them so if I put my initialization to any onCreate of these two it gets called multiple times as user navigates to them. p  pWhat I have tried so far  starting intent as startActivity and startActivityForResult, both behave same.  check manifest for statement not to retain history as i seen on some other smilar quaestions  in manifest I put androidconfigChanges for all possible values to make sure activities are not restarted due to some config changes, didnt help  tried to use onSaveInstanceState and set some simple bolean that init was done already. But onRestoreInstanceState is not called when activity is started again and no bundle is passed to onCreate method either. Save instance did happen I have logs there.p  pAlso when I leave the app by pressing home button or by putting it to background programmatically or leaving to play market and getting back to app from there by pressing back button my app activity remains loaded properly. So it gets destroyed only when I go internally from one of my activities to other by calling startActivity or startactivityForResult. p  pI could imagine that unity activity is memory hungry and previous is lets say destroyed to be freed up but in such case my bundle should be saved and passed to onCreate but it is not.p  pIm puzzled, Ive been trying to figure out how to work around this for hours. I greatly appreciate any help. Thanks guys.p

Negative 1533 pI am using EclipseLink 2.3.3. with a data model with about 100 entities.  I have a Java class mapped to each database table using annotations.p  pI have two use cases to implement.  One is that a new record enters the system that hits about 6075 of the tables.  For this case, I want merge and persist to cascade, so that I can just merge the top level object and have that cascade to all related entities.p  pAnother use case is that I need to insert a collection of individual objects, often one from each of a bunch of different tables.  In this case I dont want the cascading merge, because I need to have control over the insertions.  If I have cascade enabled, merging the first object might or might not merge the other objects, depending on if or how they are related, so Id rather explicitly merge each of them.p  pSo essentially, I want cascading merge and persist in one situation, but not another.  So if I include the cascade annotations in the mapped classes, I need to selectively disable the cascading for certain operations or, if I turn off cascading in the mapped classes, I would like to enable cascading for certain operations.p  pSo far I am not finding any way to selectively turn on or off cascading for a particular operation.  There is a CascadePolicy class but that seems to only be used with queries.  There are dynamic entities, and I was thinking perhaps I could use that to do something like create a dynamic entity from an existing entity and turn off the cascading behavior on that entitys relationships and somehow use that for the merge, but I have not been able to find the right API for that.p  pSo I am wondering if there is a better answer somewhere that Im overlooking  Thanks for any information.p

Negative 1533 pSome blogs and sites were talking about pointers are beneficial one of the causes was because the execution speed will be better in a program with pointers than without pointers. The thing I can work out is thatp  ul lipDereferencing a single location requires two or more memory accesses depending on number of indirection. Which will increase the execution time, compared to if it was used directly.pli lipPassing a pointer to a large datatype to a function, like a structure can be beneficial, as only the address of the structureunion is getting copied and its not getting passed by value. Therefore it should be faster in this case.pli ul  pFor example just by force introducing pointers without any need asp  precodeint a, b, p, q, c, d p  ampa q  ampb d  ampc   get values in a, b   d  p  q   why the heck this would be faster c  a  b      than this code  codepre  pI checked the assembler output using codegcc S masmintel file.ccode The pointer version has a lot of loading memory and storing for the dereferences than the direct method.p  pAm I missing somethingp  pemNote The question is not related to just the code.

Yet for some reason PuTTy just places the cursor in the upperleft and fails to return it.p  precodeESC         EQU   1B  ASCII ESC SAVECUR     EQU   37  ASCII 7 RESTCUR     EQU   38  ASCII 8  SaveCursor  PSHA             LDAA  ESC              Use Escape Sequence             JSR   putchar             LDAA  [             JSR   putchar             LDAA  SAVECUR          To save cursor location             JSR   putchar             PULA             RTS  GotoClkPos  PSHA             LDAA  ESC              Move Cursor             JSR   putchar             LDAA  [             JSR   putchar             LDAA  05              To Row 5             JSR   putchar             LDAA               JSR   putchar             LDAA  05              Column 5             JSR   putchar             LDAA  H             JSR   putchar             PULA             RTS  RestCursor  PSHA             LDAA   ESC             Use Escape Sequence             JSR    putchar             LDAA   [             JSR    putchar             LDAA   RESTCUR         To Restore Cursor             JSR    putchar             PULA             RTS codepre  pAm I coding the escape sequences wrong or does PuTTy not handle them as I expectp

Currently it looks likep  precodeprivate void DownloadStuffstring descriptor, ActionltStuffgt stuffAction      this.stuffDownloader.GetStuffObservabledescriptor.Subscribex gt stuffActionx  codepre  pWhere stuffDownloader is a wrapper around download logic defined in the client library. But I encountered a problem where I call DownloadStuff too much, causing many downloads, and overwhelming the system. Now what I would like to do is p  precodeprivate void DownloadStuffstring descriptor, ActionltStuffgt stuffAction      this.stuffDownloader.GetStuffObservabledescriptor         .SlowSubscribeTimeSpan.FromMilliSeconds50         .Subscribex gt stuffActionx  codepre  pWhere SlowSubscribe is some combination of Rx actions to only subscribe on some interval. p  pNormally I would just put these DownloadStuff calls on a queue and pull them off on an interval, but Ive been trying to do more through Rx lately. Three solutions occur to mep  ol liThis functionality exists and can be done all on the subscription side.li liThis is possible but the infrastructure of the downloader is incorrect and should change i.e. stuffDownloader needs to behave differentlyli liThis shouldnt be done with Rx, do it another way.li ol  pIt occurs to me 2 is possible by passing an IObservable of descriptors to the client library and somehow slowing how the descriptors get onto the Observable.p

Negative 1533 pI wrote a procedure to update a table by deriving its data from four other tables. The procedure itself works fine, but I need the table to be up to date all the time, so I call the procedure from triggers which fire, whenever one of the four tables ist altered.  This too works fine except for one detail. The procedure derives the data from the tables BEFORE the changes, so the updatedeleteinsert, which fired the trigger. The trigger is rowlevel after udi but even changing it to after statement did not help. Not using a trigger is not really an option, because of the need being in sync. Changing it to a materialized view seems to be a good idea, but neede calculations are disallowed in those and nonmaterialized views are too slow, which is why I want to change it from a nonmaterialized view to a table.  Handing all information about what was changed in which way over to the procedure would be possible, but it would make the procedure so much more complicated, that I refrain from writing this code.p  pIs there any way to derive my table based on the new values directly triggered by a change in the four tablesp  pRegards Raminp
Negative 1533 pIm trying to build a simple surveyquestionnaire app. Surveys have codeQuestionscode most questions consist of a single content field the question itself, for which the survey taker will write in a freetext response. There are also a couple of other fields not relevant to this discussion. However, users can also create codeMultipleChoiceQuestionscode or codeLikertQuestionscode e.g., answers on a 1  5 scale. In the case of codeMultipleChoiceQuestionscode, there will be another model called codeAnswercode such that a codeMultipleChoiceQuestioncode hasmany codeAnswerscode. Here are my design choices, so far as I knowp  p1 Inherit from Questionp  precodeclass Question lt ActiveRecordBase    attraccessible id, content end  class MultipleChoiceQuestion lt Question    attraccessible type end  class LikertQuestion lt Question    attraccessible type, min, max, labelmin, labelmax end codepre  p2 Use a modulemixin with the shared attributes and methodsp  precodemodule Question   content, id   def method1   end end  class MultipleChoiceQuestion lt ActiveRecordBase   include Question end  class LikertQuestion lt ActiveRecordBase   include Question   attraccessible type, min, max, labelmin, labelmax end codepre  pThis seems a clearcut case of inheritance, so I went with option 1. Since then, I cant get it to work. Single Table Inheritance seemed simple enough, so I gave codeMultipleChoiceQuestioncode and codeLikertQuestioncode each codetypestringcode in their schema. Here are the schema for each from dbschema.rbp  precode  createtable questions, force gt true do t     t.integer  parent     t.string   type     t.string   content     t.datetime createdat, null gt false     t.datetime updatedat, null gt false     t.integer  surveyid   end   createtable multiplechoicequestions, force gt true do t     t.datetime createdat, null gt false     t.datetime updatedat, null gt false     t.string   type   end    createtable likertquestions, force gt true do t     t.integer  min     t.integer  max     t.string   labelmin     t.string   labelmax     t.datetime createdat, null gt false     t.datetime updatedat, null gt false     t.string   type   end codepre  pIf I implement option 1, above, then MultipleChoiceQuestion and LikertQuestion somehow do not actually include any of their unique fields as specified in schema.rb instead, they have only the inherited fields from Question.

If I use the module approach, I lose the ability to say things like codesurvey.questionscode, codesurvey.questions.buildcode, and presumably other handy stuff. What do Rails hotshots do in this situation Ill do whatever that is.p  pNo posts on StackOverflow offer a very comprehensive discussion of the pros and cons of subclassing vs. mixin.p  pUsing Ruby 1.9.3 though thinking of switching to 2.0, Rails 3.2.3.p

Negative 1533 pIm working on a project to register pump curves in a MySQL database. So Im trying to create the closest possible one chart with 3 yAxis H, NPSH, Power and 2 xAxis flow and efficiency. I uploaded a pump curve image a hrefhttpwww.germek.ind.brcurva2curve.jpg relnofollowherea for better understanding. Note this efficiency is a logarithm scale but I prefer to create a linear scale to make it easy. Well, every curve chart has more one rotor curve, in this case we have 5 curves which is five types of rotor 176mm, 169mm, 162mm, 154mm and 148mm. Each rotor gives one data series in a yAxis as H, NPSH, Power and Efficiency. So I need to create a series for each rotor size whem each series get the values of the data H,NPSH,Power,Efficiency with its yAxis referals.

Negative 1533 pThis is more of a design question. p  pI figured out how to use the facebook login via the Facebook SDK c. p  pstrongQUESTION What is the best way to check whether the user is logged into FB or not each time the user goes to a different pagestrong p  pBack on ASP.NET webforms, I could simply put in code to check FB login status in the code behind of a master page. This was good ... once and done. But I dont understand how to implement something similar in Asp.Net MVC 4.0.p  pGiven that the Layout.cshtml file which acts like a master page is only a view hence, no code behind, what is the best way to code a way to check if the user is logged into FB each time a user goes to a different web page Because I would think, adding this bit of code to each controller cant be the optimal design solution. p  pThe only solution that I can think of involves using Javascript on the client side to do a WebApi call ... I guess the script will be bundled with all the other scripts so that it runs on each page. But I was hoping to find a solution on the server side ...  p  pIm pretty new to MVC, learning things as I go along ... tips appreciated ... thanksp

Negative 1533 pI have a rails 3 application that involves a lot of importing of CSV files from a third party into various rails models. I have developed some scripts to perform most of the heavy lifting and today I added a lot of validation to the models to make sure valid data is going into the modelstables.p  pId also like to do some logging of validation errors so I can stay on top of all of the data processing and catch and correct validation errors quickly.   To that end, I have taken the following stepsp  ol liI created a ValidationError model to store validation errors.li liI initially create an instance using new.li liOnce the object is built, I use valid method and an if conditional to determine if the object it valid.  If the the object is valid, I simply save it. If the object isnt valid I create a validation error record.li liI use the errors method to populate my ValidationsError instance. li liThen I create the ValidationError.createvalidationhash[]li liIll display the validationError model in my ActiveAdmin dashboard and send out an email when validation entries are created. li ol  pQuestions Is my proposed approach to capturing validation error reasonable.  Are there approaches that have been used by others that may be betterpreferable to what I propose. Is anyone aware of any gems or builtin functionality that would accomplish what Im trying to do.  p

Negative 1533 pIm a Math and CS student interning for a financial services company and I have to develop a database for storing data from past segment income statements and generating new reports from new data once it is imported into the database. Ive only done programming in Java and C so this is my first time dealing with databases and I have no real world application experience. Ive been reading tons of books and articles on the subject so I understand the basics. p  ul lipI have quarterly segment reports in excel going back from the present until Jan 2010 13 quarterspli lipThere are 2 different segments that categorize all the activity of the company. Im just going to call them Segment1 and Segment2 for now.pli lipBoth segments have multiple divisions operating in different countries e.g. U.S. Division, Europe Division, etc. Segment1 has 6 and Segment2 has 12.pli lipEach division services multiple industries Construction, Energy, etc. that depend on what segment they operate under . All divisions under Segment1 service 16 industries and all divisions under Segment2 service 10 industries.pli lipThere are 13 pieces of data that are tracked for each industry that are a mix of revenues and expenses.pli ul  pIve come up with a design schema but Im not very confident in it and would appreciate some advice. I just sketched it out and then recreated it in draw io. Im new to this so I dont know if there are any programs that help with this process. Red  Primary Key. Blue  Foreign Key. I abbreviated the names of the data being tracked in this picture because they are long and I didnt feel like typing them out.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5eh69.png altDatabase designp  pSo once a design is set I want to focus on finding to way to import the current data from Excel to Access My manager recommended Access because its the only program he knows of but if something else is better, hes open to it. Right now, all the segment data are in excel spreadsheets in the same format separated by division and in folders that are grouped by quarter. The columns are the various industries and the rows are the data being tracked. There is a lot extraneous info in the spreadsheets that I would like to be able to get rid of when I import data. Is there a way to automate this using VBA or some other language or would I most likely be stuck copying and pasting p  pFinally, the end goal of this database is to look for trends in data over time.

Negative 1533 pI have a multitenant database with strict and critical data separation between clients. Before putting it into production, I would like to know if my approach makes sense or could lead to problems down the road securityperformancemaintenance. Below 2 models are the typical scenariop  precodepublic class Car      [Key, ColumnOrder0]     public int carId getset      [Key, ColumnOrder1]     public int clientId getset      ...      public virtual ICollectionltComponentgt components getset   public class Component      [Key, ColumnOrder0]     public int componentId getset      [Key, ColumnOrder1]     public int clientId getset      ...      [ForeignKeycarId, clientId]     public Car car getset     public int carId getset  codepre  pThis way, every model has the clientId as a Primary Key, forcing it to be used with .Find and forcing it into jointables for manymany relationships. That means theres quite a bit of redundancy and the clientId is used when a query is actually quite safe for data separation.p  pDoes it make sense to force the clientId into just anything or might it be better to only keep it on the parent modelsp

Negative 1533 pI am relative new to C moved from Java for performance for my scientific app and I know nothing about SSE. Still, I need to improve the very simple following codep  precode    int myMaxINTMAX     int size18000003     vectorltintgt nodeCostsize       init part      for int k0kltsizek      nodeCost[k]myMax      codepre  pI have measured the time for the initialization part and it takes 13ms which is way too big for my scientific app the entire algorithm runs in 22ms which means that the initialization takes 12 of the total time. Keep in mind that the initialization part will be repeated multiple times for the same vector. p  pAs you see the size of the vector is not divided by 4. Is there a way to accelerate the initialization with SSE Can you suggest how Do I need to use arrays or SSE can be used with vectors as wellp  pPlease, since I need your help lets all avoid a how did you measure the time or b premature optimization is the root of all evil which are both reasonable for you to ask but a the measured time is correct b I agree with it but I have no other choice. I do not want to parallelize the code with OpenMP, so SSE is the only fallback.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 1533 pI am trying to create a custom language service for Visual Studio 20122013 there doesnt seem to be much of a difference between these two. The custom language service is for a compiler that has yet not been integrated into Visual Studio. I started by creating a Visual Studio package for my custom project type. It all works fine, but when I create a new project in Visual Studio it crashes. Sometimes it only crashes when I close Visual Studio. I always get a COMException with no other hint to the problem. I think there is nothing wrong with my Visual Studio package but rather with my custom project file. It builds fine when I use MSBUILD but Visual Studio doesnt like it for some reason.

Negative 1533 pI have some functions which, under normal circumstances, are called with arguments provided by user input. It is, however, valid to call some of these functions with certain series of arguments which are determined at runtime based on some system state.p  pI would like for the user to be able to emoptionallyem instruct my program to call these functions with all valid input and return the results of each call. I think a decorator which would work something like an activation switch for functions which have another decorator which indicates which series of arguments to use would work well.p  pAdditionally, I emneedem to preserve the function signature and metadata.

It thinks I am trying to pass two arguments but why would that be a problem anywayli ol  hr  pAs for my motivation, I think of decorators for this because there are literally hundreds of these routines, their implementation details as well as their functional correctness is subject to frequent change, and I dont want to use codeinspectcode to reason what to do based on their argument names nor do I want to hardcode the codedoallcode functionality for each function for which it makes sense. Class methods might work, but for my purpose, theyre semantically contrived. Furthermore, for the sake of others who may have to maintain my code, I think it is easier to ask them to apply a decorator and not to worry about the rest rather than to use certain argument names or place the function in a certain class or whatever. I realize this question may sound strange, so I figured this footnote might help make me look less like a madman.p

Negative 1533 pI working with a SPARC V8 processor which is connected to memory with a 32Bit data bus. From the SPARC architecture manual V8, I have learned, that there are instructions to load  store a single 32Bit register word, but also instructions to load  store a double word into  from 2 registers atomically. Are the double word instructions somehow faster than the single word instructions on my machine What else than the data bus width does it depend onp  pFurther, I discovered a optimized memcpy implementation in the Linux kernel sources, which copies a aligned chunk as followsp  precodedefine MOVEBIGALIGNCHUNK...  ldd     [src  offset  0x00], t0  ldd     [src  offset  0x08], t2  ldd     [src  offset  0x10], t4  ldd     [src  offset  0x18], t6  std     t0, [dst  offset  0x00]  std     t2, [dst  offset  0x08]  std     t4, [dst  offset  0x10]  std     t6, [dst  offset  0x18]  codepre  pIs there any benfit from grouping loads and stores together Just curious.. Thanksp  pUpdate Im using Gaislers LEON3 implementation and Im on the bare metal. ldd and std are implemented and do not trap. I measured that copying a big junk of data with ldd and std is faster by a factor of 1.5. There are indeed data and instruction caches present and it makes sense to me that they can speed up double word operations. I also agree, that the overhead must be somehow reduced when fetching two consecutive words from memory. Thanks all for your comments.p

Negative 1533 pWe have a complex multiservice that needs to do some fairly intricate accounting when shutting down in order to implement a graceful shutdown.p  pIm trying to write tests for this under trial. The issue is that the reactor is effectively a  processglobal resource, and shutting down my service means that trials reactor is also stopped, which of course makes it explode.p  pThis is a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocuments12.2.0corehowtotesting.htmlauto3 relnofollowdocumented to be a nono in triala, but I need some kind of workaround that allows me to write my tests. My first thought was to use a a hrefhttpwww.voidspace.org.ukpythonmock relnofollowmock.Mocka, but this means were not really using a reactor thats shutting down, which isnt going to give me behavior thats faithful to the actual shutdown process.p  pI believe what I need is a way to separate trials reactor from the reactor of my serviceundertest. Sharing a mutable resource between the test system and the system under test is surely an antipattern.p

Negative 1533 pWe found that your app uses one or more nonpublic APIs, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. The use of nonpublic APIs is not permissible because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change. p  pWe found the following nonpublic APIs in your appp  pallowsAnyHTTPSCertificateForHostp  pIf you have defined methods in your source code with the same names as the abovementioned APIs, we suggest altering your method names so that they no longer collide with Apples private APIs to avoid your application being flagged in future submissions.p  pAdditionally, one or more of the abovementioned APIs may reside in a static library included with your application. If you do not have access to the librarys source, you may be able to search the compiled binary using strings or otool command line tools. The strings tool can output a list of the methods that the library calls and otool ov will output the ObjectiveC class structures and their defined methods. These techniques can help you narrow down where the problematic code resides.p  pWe appreciate that you may have made the precautions in your code for using nonpublic APIs, however, there is no way to accurately or completely predict how an API may be modified and what effects those modifications may have. For this reason, we do not permit the use of nonpublic APIs in App Store apps.p  pIf there are no alternatives for providing the functionality your app requires, we encourage you to file an enhancement request. Or, try working with the Apple Developer Technical Support team to explore alternative solutions. p  pOn occasion, there may be apps on the App Store that dont appear to be in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. We work hard to ensure that the apps on the App Store are in compliance and we try to identify any apps currently on the App Store that may not be. It takes time to identify these occurrences but another app being out of compliance is not a reason for your app to be.p  pFor discrete codelevel questions, you may wish to consult with Apple Developer Technical Support.

Negative 1533 pI recently started to work with an API in our Java application environment which uses JOGL makes OpenGL commands accessible in Java to create a 3D environment within our application so I am pretty new to OpenGL. p  pThis API uses display lists to group and speed up the commands to display a geometric component. So far, in the display method, first all the changes to the scene made by the mouse are applied zoom, rotation, translation, then the current display list is called.  The API provides a variety of scene elements surfaces, light, transformations which are put into a treelike structure. This structure determines the order in which these scene elements will be executed later. This execution of the scene tree is than put into a display list. This works as intended.p  pWhat I want to add now is a small coordinate system as a representation of the components current orientation. This would be a new scene element to be added to the scene tree. This coordinate system should obviously be influenced by rotations done with the mouse, but it should not be scaled or translated to other places.p  pMy problem is As the mouse movements are applied outside of the execution of the scene tree, I dont know how to apply strongonly the rotationstrong to strongonly a certain scene elementstrong of the tree. I cant just revert the mouse movement in the corresponding part of the display list in my understanding because that would mean the display list would have to take the parameter of the mouse positions changes. But I cant work with parameters in display lists as their state is determined once and then only executed in this state correct. I cant just reset the projection matrix as I would lose the rotation state.p  pI hope my problem is understandable. Is there a way to do this with display lists or do I might have to replace the display lists in this API with an alternative They dont seem to be recommended anyway.p

Negative 1533 pIm trying to keep to SOLID object oriented programming principles, stay DRY, etc, but my newness to PythonSQLAlchemyPyramid is making it very hard.p  pIm trying to take what I now know to be a SQLAlchemy model used to create a simple Pyramid Framework object and use what I know to be reflection in C, it may be called something different in Python Introspection Not sure as this is only my second week with python but I have lots of experience in other languages CCC,Java, etc so the trouble seems to be mapping my knowledge to the vocabulary of python, sorry, to find out the field names of the database table, and most importantly, the current field values, when I do not know the column names or ANY of the shape of the object in advance.p  pThats right I dont know that the derp instance has a field named id or name, just that it has columns and a value in each of them. And thats all I care about.p  pThe goal is to be able to take any SQLAlchemy defined data model, and convert it to a dictionary of columnname  columnvalue fields of simple data types of the kind found in JSON as I want to ultimately serialize any object I create in SQLAlchemy to a json object, but I will settle for a dictionary as from there its trivial as long as the dictionary holds the correct types of data.  Doing this for every object by hand is a violation of too many good clean code rules and will create too much work over time I could spend another week on this and still save time and effort by doing it the right way.p  pSo if I have a class defined in SQLAlchemy asp  precodeclass SimpleFooModelBase     id  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue, autoincrementTrue, nullableFalse     name  ColumnVARCHARlength12, nullableFalse, indexTrue codepre  p.. and I have an instance of this equal to in pythonp  precodederp  SimpleFooModelid7, nameFoobar codepre  pI want to be able to having ONLY the derp instance variable described above, and NO OTHER KNOWLEDGE of how the model is shaped, and be able to flatten it out to a python keyvalue dictionary for that simple object, where every value in that dictionary can be serialized to JSON using import json from python syslib.p  pThe problem is , I have been up for 2 days looking at this and I cant find an answer that gives me the results I want in my unit tests ANYWHERE Google keeps taking me to really old posts here on SO about really old versions of the library that either use interfaces that no longer apply, or have accepted answers that do not actually work at all and since none of them are recent that does surprise me but why Stack Overflow keeps them when they are wrong and allows google to mislead people does surprise mep  pI know I could wire every object manually for every object to json, etc, but thats not only NOT ELEGANT, its inefficient because it just creates more work for me as I create more objects and could lead to big bugs down the road. I want to know how to do this the correct way, with introspectionreflection, but nobody seems to know, and the people who claim to have all given examples here on stack overflow that actually do not work at all at least with the current versions of thingsp  pThis seems like a really common use case for me and getting the column field list and then iterating through it with getattr  like many of the answers say to do  doesnt work as expected either it just creates what look like namespaces that never return the actual value of the column, and dont actually exist in any code as none of the fields created by sqlalchmy are singletonstatic.p  pSop  precode    from sqlalchemy.inspection import inspect      obj  inspectderp, raiseerrTrue      for key in obj.attrs.keys         fields[key]  getattrderp, key         print fields[key] codepre  pJust gives mep  precode    [Class Name].[Column Name] codepre  p.. or in this case just gives mep  precode    SimpleFooModel.id     SimpleFooModel.name codepre  pNOT the values of 7 and Foobar for id and name respectively, that I actually expected in my tests.p  pIn fact it seems like I cant even find WHERE the values are being stored in the object model or I could brute force the issue and get them from there as an ugly, evil hack I would be ashamed to look at.  All I get through the official public api is a lot of objects that seem to have no clue where the real data is being stored, but will happily tell me the name of the path used by the column name and type, restrictions, etc... just not the actual data that I want.p  pYet since my requirement is that I do not know the field names in advance, using a call to derp.id or derp.name to collect the value is not an option since that would violate SOLID and force me to duplicate work for every single class.  So its not an option.p  pMaybe its the fact I have not slept in 2 days but its really hard for me to not see this as a serious design flaw in these libs I just want to serialize a SQLAlchemy defined Model object representing a single row in a table into a python dictionary without having to know the names of the fields in advance, and while many other languages make this easy or even trivial, this seems to be far too hard than it should be.p  pCan somebody please explain either a working solution or why I am wrong to want to apply SOLID to my codep  pEDIT Updated spelling.p

Negative 1533 pI wrote a pretty complicated widget that uses OnDemandList to create a widget that allows full editing including adding of a store. p  pNow...

Or shall I do that with CSS I did it programmatically because its emreallyem important that its coderelativecode. p  p2 Is it OK in terms of CSS to leave things as nonspecific as possible The idea is that users might and probably will end up writing their own CSS, and overriding things by writing more specific rules... is that right Or maybe I should have written p  precode.editablelist .editablelistroweditor     position absolute    top 0    zindex 20    codepre  pOr better p  precode.editablelist .roweditor     position absolute    top 0    zindex 20    codepre  p... p  p3 From what I am seeing, CSS classes for widgets should be set in codepostCreatecode rather than codebuildRenderingcode, otherwise Dojo seems to use codeclassNamecode to zap anything that was set there... is that what youd normally do with a widget that creates its own domNode p

This would probably lead to a null property whenever codeArticlecode is accessed, correct If so, then I would have to perform another query to get the User.p  pThis would be a problem if the user needs to search articles for example by the writers roles, which are part of codeAccountsDbContextcode. I would have to grab all results first, query the user info for each result, then filter. That seems rather slow and would definitely be a waste of computation with pagination.p  pIs there a better way to handle this situation Again, were going by the assumption that we cant foreignkey across data contexts.p

Negative 1533 pTrying to get a better grasp of how an UITableViews works, so I provided a background question Im not sure about, which leads into my actual question belowp  p1 When a cell is first created, you include the p  precodeif cell      cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]  codepre  pblock to init the cell. After that, if you are reusing a cell, the ifstatement will be skipped and you will just use the previous cell you setup before for the new cell you are now creating be the deque method. Is that correctp  p2 Using Storyboard, I have a segmented control created in a prototype cell for two indices Attending and Not Attending, so every new cell creates a new segmented control. No index should be selected upon creation of a cell, however I was having trouble as an index would be selected when I added a new rowcell to the table. p  pLets take this scenario I create my first cell, Attending and Not Attending are both not selected as expected. Say now I select one of the indices, and now add a new rowcell to my table. The question I have is when I setup breakpoints and Im looking at the creation of a new cell, namely this step belowp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath   ...      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier forIndexPathindexPath] codepre  pAnd I look at my selectedIndex in the debugger, it stores the same selectedIndex value as the cell I just modified ie. Attending or Not Attending, whatever I selected before represented by 0 or 1. I guess this makes sense because I am dequeueing a reusablecell, so I guess the tags and such point to the previous cell I was able to solve this problem of resetting the new cell to have no index selected at creation by doing the followingp  pNote, the default selectedIndex for new event objectcell, labeled here asannouncements, is 2p  precode   set correct index     if [[self.announcements objectAtIndexindexPath.section] selectedIndex]  2         [attendingSegmentedControl setSelectedSegmentIndexUISegmentedControlNoSegment]          else          attendingSegmentedControl.selectedSegmentIndex  [[self.announcements objectAtIndexindexPath.section] selectedIndex]        codepre  pSo now when I create a new cell, even though the SegmentedControl selectedIndex is either 0 or 1 after I already selected in a previous cell, the initial selectedIndex for the strongobjectstrong is 2. Hence Im forcing the SegmentedContorls selectedIndex to change to nothing being selected. Is this the right approach here Been reading up on cell dequeing questions and this was the best solution I came up with myselfp

Negative 1533 pSo I am making this billing system where a user is able to configure a VPS. As seen in websites like Dell, the price of the server updates as you choose a specific option. I dont want the user to have to press a button Refresh every time they want to see the price of the new VPS. I have no idea how to do this, I tried to do some research and the only thing I found that was remotely close to this was things like Comet. Im guessing that JavaScript should detect the change and change the overall price. Any suggestionsideasp

Negative 1533 pI have a grid environment which contains in each cell a static agent. When my agent enters a cell, the static agent in this cell might take points away from me, give me points, or do nothing. My agent can not observe adjacent cells until it moves into one them, it can only move up, down, left or right.p  pThis agent can not learn whilst it is exploring. It enters the grid from a particular corner, and may only leave from that corner. If the agent manages to successfully explore the environment and return back to the corner with positive health, emthenem it can learn from its collected experience, which includes the row, column positions it visited, and the properties of the static agents located in those positions. If the agents health drops to zero whilst exploring, game over. But I can restart the exploration as many times as I want.p  pEach static agent has one of three shapes, one of three colours, and one of two sizes. It also has an associated reward, indicating how many points it addsremoves from me.p  pEach move in this environment costs me one point. I want to design an agent that correctly recognises the reward associated with each type of static agent in this grid.p  pPlease may someone recommend a learning andor evolutionary approach to solving this problem Im stuck at the moment because of the restriction that agent may not observe adjacent squares. Im not sure how I can learn anything from this testing environment from the row, column and static agent properties encountered alone.p

Negative 1533 pI am distributing an app which binds to 1200 port to listen for UDP packets. App is installed on 50 machines which are set to auto restart in 730AM and to auto login some specific user and when that user is logging in to auto start my app.  Problem is that on that morning machine restart about 5 machines wont start my app because my app fails with codejava.net.SocketException Already bound exceptioncode for that 1200 port. But when you then login to the machine and try starting the app manually it starts without problems.p  pThere is nothing unusual installed on this machines, some vnc server, and few other apps that should not use this port. Can it be that while Windows is booting it randomly takes this port or something like that Because I only experienced this behaviour when machine is restarted, not when that user is logging off and than back in which kills and starts my app.p  pI am using standard codeDatagramChannelcode to bind to the port, nothing exotic.p  precodeDatagramChannel channel  DatagramChannel.open channel.socket.bindnew InetSocketAddress1200 codepre  pProblematic machines are different every day, not always the same ones.p

Negative 1533 pI am aware scope.watch should be used in directives. However, I believe I have a special case where scope.watch may be necessary in the controller. I have a date variable on the controller in this formatp  precodescope.myDateParts  year 2014, month 1, day 1 codepre  pI need another varible that represents a date of codemyDatePartscode. So, if the variable above changes the date needs to change as wellp  precodescope.myDate  new Datescope.myDateParts.year, scope.myDateParts.month, scope.myDateParts.day codepre  pmyDateParts and myDate need to stay in sync. My original solution was to manually change myDate when myDateParts change. But, there are many places where codemyDatePartscode can change and it is difficult to keep track of every place it changes. To solve this I wanted to use scope.watch on myDateParts. I am not sure if this is the right approach to solve this problem. My question is  is using scope.watch in this manner the right way to do this If not can you suggest a technique suitable for this situationp

When the user hits restore, I want to execute different code to restore. When the user drags to resize or uses the keyboard shortcut to do so I want it to execute different code altogether.p

Negative 1533 pI did a project in OpenGL version 3.2 once where I used a sampler2DArray to store multiple images with the same dimensions and rendered them using textured points.p  pNow I am trying to port that project to my gnulinux computer. This computer only supports up to OpenGL version to 2.1 and GLSL version up to 1.20 which doesnt have sampler2DArray. As far as I know there is no way to update OpenGL to support the newer features.p  pWhat I am currently trying to do is to use a sampler3D to store my images and use the depth value to select the image I want.p  pTo send the texture depth from the vertex shader to the fragment shader I have declared a varying float variable holding the depth value 0.0 to 1.0. p  pI am rendering 4 images at the locations 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.5, 0.5.p  pThe image switching method appears to be working changing the index variable changes the image. But for some wierd reason all images gets rendered at 0.0, 0.0 and not at their assigned positions. This problem goes away when I dont assign to the varying variable containing the depth value for the texture and set the depth value to 0.0 in the fragment shader.p  pHere is the vertex shaderp  precodeversion 120  attribute vec2 position attribute float index varying float vindex  void main      glPosition  vec4position, 0.0, 1.0     vindex  index  Removing this assignment makes the images appear at their assigned locations.  codepre  pHere is the fragment shaderp  precodeversion 120  uniform sampler3D texture varying float vindex  void main      glFragColor  texture3Dtexture, vec3glPointCoord, vindex  codepre  pThe structure I use represent verticesp  precodestruct vertex      GLfloat x     GLfloat y     GLfloat textureindex  codepre  pThe calls to the codeglVertexAttribPointercode function the problem may be here toop  precodeglBindAttribLocationshaderprogram, 0, position glEnableVertexAttribArray0 glVertexAttribPointer0, 2, GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, sizeofstruct vertex, void 0 glBindAttribLocationshaderprogram, 1, index glEnableVertexAttribArray1 glVertexAttribPointer1, 1, GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, sizeofstruct vertex, void 2  sizeofGLfloat codepre  pI have also found a very similar question.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions  or if anyone could post the XML for a working chart that uses a subDataset.p  p UPDATE 2  STILL NO LUCK  Thank you for the reply.  I still cant get this to work.  I modified your code slightly because you were using reportingData as the name of the field containing the subDataset, but that is the name of the top level of the report.

Should I be looking at a different object  It wont let me access p  precodecookies[connect.sess].passport codepre  pbecause thats undefined which makes sense since cookies[connect.sess] returns a string.  Any hints as to where Im going wrong here  All I need to do is access these cookies that were set in the server.  I dont need to change them.  Im hoping an extra set of eyes on this will do the trick.  Im stumped p  pI tried setting my own cookies by using res.cookie.  On the server side where I am creating the cookie it looks fine.  But somewhere between there and angular, it looks like jmy json cookie  This time no s in front and no gobbledegook on the end.  Sure I can parse that stuff out and find my json, but where is this stuff getting added and whyp  pI did some poking around and the express response.cookie adds the j in front of the json if you pass in an object.  and the s with the blurb after the json object is their way of signing a cookie.  So I found that I didnt really need the session cookies that passports was sending.  I could just use the userid in the session cookies for authentication on the server side and create my own email and role cookies created usingp  precoderes.cookieemail, user.email, my cookie options  res.cookierole, user.role, my cookie options codepre  pinstead of trying to populate the session cookies with a json object.  The answer Ive chosen below is the best option given what I know today.  Although I find it hard to believe that you have to strip characters off an object to get client cookies properly.  Seems odd.  Im a cookie newbie, so if anyone has an explanation or a good link for reading Id love to hear it.p

I want to make the script just display a dialog that says something like App not found. p  pHeres what I have so far p  precodeif userInput contains Activate  then set TID, text item delimiters to text item delimiters, Activate  if length of userInput is less than or equal to 1 then say resultString as string if length of userInput is greater than or equal to 2 then set resultString to text item 2 of userInput set openApp to resultString as string if userInput contains Activate  then set text item delimiters to TID if userInput contains Activate  then tell application openApp as string to activate codepre  pBTW, this is just a snippet of my script, which is why there are some undefined variables here.p  pI triedp  precodeset appList to do shell script cd Applications ls if openApp is not in appList then display dialog App not found codepre  pHuh, Applescript syntax can be so annoying sometimes.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1533 pIm refactoring a notsocomplex website based on Symfony 2.2  PHP 5.3, and the main issue here is repeated code.p  pThere are two bundles, one for the main website, and another with the mobile version. Those differences are not only on templates and static files, as they comprise some differences in business rules and so on.p  pCurrently those two bundles sport three controllers, one being the main guy, another being the exceptions controller, but a third is the mothercontroller, that holds several common methods and behaviours, and is inherited by the actual controllers.br This poses a small problem, since I cant simply make the action controllers of the mobile bundle inherit from the desktop bundle. All I could do is implement inheritance between the mobiles codeDefaultControllercode and the desktop one... And thus I still have a bunch of actions almost equal, except for some custom lines.p  pIs there a way to extract those actions to a generic class and them import them into the controllers like we have in Yiis Action classes I searched about using the decorator pattern to no avail, and was wondering if theres any sort of known method to implement this idea.p

I gave a very small setTimeout function to the beginning of parent function calling the synchronous ajaxbased login checks, during which time the loading gif can be launched, and viewed simultaneously while ajax runs.

Negative 1533 pI python seems work with not big length of input string, but it failed with pretty long string. Here is the problem statementp  pA string S is called special if it satisfies the following two properties Each character in S is either 0 or 1. Whenever S  UV where both U and V are nonempty strings, U is strictly smaller than V in lexicographic order. For example, the string S  00101 is special because we have 0 lt 0101, 00 lt 101, 001 lt 01, and 0010 lt 1. You are given a string current that is guaranteed to be special. Let N be the length of current. Consider the lexicographically sorted list of all special strings of length N. Compute and return the string that comes immediately after current in this list. If current happens to be the last string in the list, return an empty string instead.p  pHere is my python codep  precodeclass SpecialStringsobject     def findNextself, current         if current  0             return 1         N  lencurrent         itertimes  2  N  intcurrent, 2  1         tempcurrent  current         for i in rangeitertimes             temps  self.getnextstringtempcurrent             if self.isspecialtemps                 return temps             if temps[0]  1                 return              tempcurrent  temps         return       def getnextstringself, s         nextstring  binints, 2  1         nextstring  nextstring[2]         if lennextstring lt lens             tempzero  0  lens  lennextstring             nextstring  tempzero  nextstring         return nextstring      def isspecialself, s         for i in range1, lens             left  s[i]             right  s[i]             if left gt right                 return False         return True codepre  pI received abnormal termination with inputs 0111111111111111111111111111 and 001111111111111111111111111111111111111111.

It is possible to monitor the stack with jstack but then you should have a pid, which isnt a problem itself. The problem is that the program is so small and finished so fast that even thinking of launching jstack is impossible. So how can I monitor an applications stack that finishes quite fast. Can I record the stack or something and monitor it afterwards or is the thing that Im trying to do just not possiblep

Negative 1533 pIm using mysql database in PHP via PDO as an interface. I need to get the values of row matched and changes of the table when I apply update or delete query. Lets say for example, I applied this sql statement p  precodeUPDATE user SET country  UK WHEN country  United Kingdom codepre  pI used codePDOrowCountcode to detect the numbers of affected row. The problem is that if user accidentally or intentionally try to update the details by providing the same values for eg. p  precodeUPDATE user SET firstnameBob WHEN firstnameBob  codepre  pit returns 0 since it doesnt change anything to the database. But, if codefirstnameBobcode does not exist in the database, PDO still returning 0. I know I can use codePDOMYSQLATTRFOUNDROWScode to get numbers of matched row instead of numbers of affected row. But, i need both matched rows, affected row or changes to differentiate between if the record does not exist or if the query didnt update anything.p  pIs there any way to do itp  pIs there any alternative to get the same info like codemysqlgtinfocode just like in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5289475getnumberofrowsmatchedbyupdatequerywithphpmysqlilinka with PDOp

Negative 1533 pIve noticed a weird behaviour of gVim say I have a window with a line longer than its width and Ive codeset wrap linebreak cursorlinecode, if I hit kbdskbd, kbdSkbd, kbdckbdcodemotioncode or kbdcckbd but not kbdikbd, kbdakbd kbdokbd or kbdOkbd on another line and then hit kbdkbd, lines on this window are for some mysterious cause no longer wrapped at word boundaries it looks as if Ive codeset wrap nolinebreakcode. If I hit kbdEsckbd and then kbdjkbd or kbdkkbd it returns to normal display.p  pThis should obviously not occur. Is it a bug in Vim or something I did wrong It occurs when invoking Vim emtabula rasaem codevim noplugins u NONEcode or codegvim noplugins u NONEcode as well. My machine is Arch Linux, and the Vim version I use is 7.4.537. Ive tested it on another Arch Linux machine I have and it behaves the same, but when I codesshcodeed my DreamHost account, on which Vim 7.3.429 is installed, it behaves as it should.p  pNote it doesnt occur without codecursorlinecode on another line, so I guess its connected somehow, but Im not really sure how. It occurs anyway if edit using kbdskbd or kbdckbdkbdjkbd on the same long line than it affects only this line.p  pCan you confirm or disconfirm this erroneous behaviour occurs on your machine How can one fix thisp  pIf it isnt only me and it emisem a bug, Ill send a bug report.p  pThank you very much p

As youve pointed out, this only has the prebuilt WAR file in it. However, if I browse the contents of the WAR file, I find no MoquiDefaultConf.xml file. In fact, the only XML file in the whole WAR file is web.xml.p  pUpon discovering this, and after reading the chapter in the book regarding setup, I googled MoquiDefaultConf.xml and found the file on github. I then copied the datasource element out of that and simply pasted that into the entityfacade of ALL the listed MoquiConf.xml to make sure it got picked up....which it finally did but with the halting issue. I tried both inline jdbc options once with the one with the xaproperties tag and once with the one without.p  pSorry. I am from a Microsoft background so this is all a bit foreign to me , but in my defence I was technically capable of getting OFBiz up and running by fumbling around like this.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOK. Progress.p  pTurns out I was running Postgres 9.1 not 9.4 Oops. Linux noob with postgresql9.31102.jdbc4.jar driver. Not sure if that was contributing to the halting but I upgraded to Postgres 9.4 with postgresql9.31102.jdbc41.jar driver, and the halting was still happening.p  pDavid, you correctly pointed out the missing startupaddmissing and runtimeaddmissing attributes. The reason this happened was because I had initially tried to cobble the datasource element together from OFBiz equivalent, and when I eventually found the MoquiDefaultConf.xml online, I only copied the inlinejdbc elements into the datasource elements I used from OFBiz and didnt copy the whole datasource element. Silly. Anyway, after adding the datasource element to ONLY the MoquiDevConf.xml and gradle loading, 91 tables were created in Postgres so the build completed successfully....well sort of.p  pA derby database called MoquiDEFAULT is strongstillstrong created in the derby folder in the db folder. I can confirm that the webapp is talking to Postgres because I created an entry in the Example grid and it appeared in the example table in Postgres. I dont know enough about the internals to know if queries are duplicating on the derby database.p  pLastly, after using a process of elimination, I determined that the build was using MoquiDevConfig.xml and not MoquiProductionConf.xml. I.e. when I put the datasource in only the MoquiProductionConf.xml entityfacade element, it has no effect and creates tables only in derby well...over 100 .dat files and none in Postgres. This is confusing given that MoquiInit.properties only ever references MoquiProductionConf.xml. I can confirm that building using MoquiDevConfig.xml generates about 20 fewer .dat files than does MoquiProductionConf.xml. I dont know enough about Gradle build files to know what to change.p  pMoquiDevConf.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 gt codepre  p p  precodelttools enableelasticsearchtrue enablecamelfalsegt  ltcachelistgt     lt Development Mode  dont use these for production, load testing, etc.          Cleared by default every 20 seconds from when loaded into cache. gt     ltcache nameentity.definition expiretimeidle30gt     lt longer timeout since this basically looks through all files to check for new or moved entity defs gt     ltcache nameentity.location expiretimeidle300gt     ltcache nameentity.data.feed.info expiretimeidle30gt      ltcache nameservice.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameservice.java.class expiretimeidle5gt      ltcache namekie.component.releaseId expiretimeidle5gt      ltcache namescreen.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache namescreen.template.mode expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache namescreen.template.location expiretimeidle5gt      ltcache nameresource.xmlactions.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameresource.groovy.location expiretimeidle5gt     lt longer timeout because these are cached by the expression text itself, so changed text is a new entry gt     ltcache nameresource.groovy.expression expiretimeidle600gt     ltcache nameresource.javascript.location expiretimeidle5gt      ltcache nameresource.ftl.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameresource.gstring.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameresource.wiki.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameresource.markdown.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameresource.text.location expiretimeidle5gt     ltcache nameresource.reference.location expiretimeidle5gt      ltcache namel10n.message expiretimeidle600gt ltcachelistgt  ltserverstats statsskipconditionec.web.request.pathInfo.startsWithrpc  ec.web.request.pathInfo.startsWithstatusgt     lt For development, track everything Itll run slow through... gt     ltartifactstats typescreen persistbintrue persisthittruegt     ltartifactstats typescreencontent persistbintrue persisthittruegt     ltartifactstats typetransition persistbintrue persisthittruegt     ltartifactstats typeservice persistbintrue persisthittruegt     ltartifactstats typeservice subtypeentityauto persistbintrue persisthitfalsegt     ltartifactstats typeservice subtypeentityimplicit persistbintrue persisthitfalsegt     ltartifactstats typeentity persistbintruegt ltserverstatsgt  ltwebapplistgt     ltwebapp namewebroot httpport8080 httpsenabledfalsegt         ltrootscreen host. locationcomponentwebrootscreenwebroot.xmlgt     ltwebappgt ltwebapplistgt  ltscreenfacade boundarycommentstruegt     lt The default conf file has a macro location defined for html already, but this is an example of how to         refer to a file to override the default macros. gt     ltscreentextoutput typehtml mimetypetexthtml                         macrotemplatelocationtemplatescreenmacroScreenHtmlMacros.ftlgt ltscreenfacadegt  ltentityfacade cryptpassMoquiDefaultPasswordCHANGEMEgt ltdatasource groupnametransactional databaseconfnamepostgres schemanamepublic startupaddmissingtrue runtimeaddmissingfalsegt     ltinlinejdbc poolminsize5 poolmaxsize50gt     ltxaproperties usermoqui passwordmoqui serverNamelocalhost portNumber5432               databaseNameMoquiDEFAULTgt     ltinlinejdbcgt     lt ltinlinejdbc jdbcurijdbcpostgresql127.0.0.1MoquiDEFAULT         jdbcusernamemoqui jdbcpasswordmoqui poolminsize2 poolmaxsize50gt gt ltdatasourcegt ltentityfacadegt  ltrepositorylistgt     lt ltrepository namemain locationhttplocalhost8081rmi typermi workspacedefault                 usernameadmin passwordadmingt gt ltrepositorylistgt ltcomponentlistgt     lt This loads the tools component over top of the default one, which will result in a warning but works         fine.

Negative 1533 pIm implementing profile pictures in my android application. I came to a decision that I dont know which road to take. The problem is that I have to store the images that users upload and view them also to their contacts  friends, as in telegram I see the images of others and they see mine. 1 First hypothesis I know that MySQL can store images in a field with the blob tell me if Im wrong, so you just have to upload and download images from grabbing this field. 2 Second hypothesis The user loads the image, I memorize in a folder a bit like a cloud, unless its path on the server in a field in the database for example in the field photo I put httpsiteprojectimage.jpg  and I download the photos to his friends in this way.p  pI do not know how to do, which one should I choose The first method to store the file directly in mysql does not make me become the database slower and less accurate The application handles messages, post etc. as in a social network, the pictures can give problems  The second method seems faster though less elegant. I trust in your wise advice, thanks for the reply Dp

Negative 1533 pI am using Cassandra to hold counter fields for some analytics that we need to process.p  pI noticed that for a given write event where a bunch of counters are incremented, there seems to be a read operation.

Negative 1533 pI have read through handfuls of what would seem to make this a duplicate question. But reading through all of these has left me uncertain.

Also set up a unique constraint on BookID and AuthorID.p  pIm looking for a simple answer as to why one method is better than another in the ABOVE particular example. The answers that Im reading are very detailed, and I was just about to settle on a compound key, but then watched a video where the example used an Identity column like my first example.p  pIt seems this topic is slightly torn in half, but my gut is telling me that I should just use a composite key.p  pWhats more efficient for querying It seems having a PK identity column along with setting up a unique constraint on the two columns, AND the FK relationships would be more costly, even if a little.p

Negative 1533 pWe are trying to design a recommender system of documents in which documents are constantly being updated. Actually the documents are streams to which text usually gets appended. p  pInitially we planned to use lucene  solr. But that is good for mostly static documents.The way lucene updates a document is by deleting it first and then reindexing it. So if document is updated frequently above approach results in slower indexing as corpus size and average document size increases.p  pWe were also tempted to build our own solution but gave up after prototyping as we were drifting towards reinventing information retrieval functionalities which were already  implemented quite well in lucene. Does any one has any experience of building this kind of system by integrating open source search and machinelearning tools.p

Negative 1533 pI am writing an asp.net application that has multiple web forms, each with different purposes and controls. During development I put all of the javascript needed on the form at the bottom of the form in  tags button event handlers, validation, some custom jQuery control handlers, etc. I do have some javascript in external files, for instance if I have functions that are not specific to the individual form or functions that I reuse.p  pNow that we are getting close to the release date, I wonder if I should put this javascript inside of a separate file. Thinking about it on my own, it would be easier to maintain having all the functionality of the form easily accessible in the 1 file. However in most of the web stuff I see, the javascript is generally in an external file.p  pI would like to see if anyone has any views on this, one way or the other.p

Negative 1533 pI havent used Java in over a year SQL guy and have no experience with clientserversocket implementations. I currently have a very simple client server program that will perform a rudimentary version of this guessing game with one player client. I have attempted to find ways online to create the functionality of having two players with only one client class, such as threading, that also simulates each player taking turns. Unfortunately all of my attempts have been unsuccessful. The additional part that is giving me trouble is that this must be done only with one server class and one client class. All examples I have seen typically use a thread andor protocol class to achieve this.In addition I receive the following error after I have completed the game and typed exit to close the sockets. I assume I am not closing them properly. Through my research I feel that it may be due to the order in which I close the sockets, but I have been unable to resolve it. The error message, code, and assignment are below.

The complete code should play a guessing game between two clients, where they each take turns guessing a number chosen by the server within a given range.p  pThe Server Class should establish a connection on the localhost and wait for the connection to be joined by TWO clients. Make sure each client is addressed separately each one will be receiving slightly different information. Once the connection is made with the two clients, the server will generate a random integer from 1 to 99 and have the clients take turns guessing until one of them guesses the correct integer. If a guess is incorrect, the server should give a reply as such not necessarily verbatimp  pIf the guess is the exact number chosen, the server should let both clients know that the guess was correct and should terminate the connection.p  pIf the guess was not the exact number but was within 10 numbers i.e. if the number is 20 and the client guessed 11, the server should tell both clients that the guess is Hot.p  pIf the guess was not within 10 numbers but was within 25 numbers, the server should tell both clients that the guess is Warm.p  pIf the guess was not within 25 numbers, the server should tell both clients that the guess was Cold.p  pNote, the server should read an integer ONLY from the client whose turn it is. The two clients should take turns guessing, starting with the first client to connect. The server should also accept the guess and send back the number that was guessed and the reply to the guess to both clients.p  pThe Client Class should ask for an IP when tested, enter localhost instead of an actual IP, connect to a server listening to the given port I use 9999 as an arbitrary default port, but any available port is fine, and define itself as either Client 1 or Client 2. Then, once both Clients are connected, the Client should find out from the server whose turn it is to guess, display the appropriate message [after each guess], and act accordingly until the correct number is guessed. The Client should also validate userentered data to confirm that the users entry is an integer between 1 and 99.p  pNOTE You should only have ONE client class that functions as either client 1 or client 2, depending on when it connects to the server.p  pPlease Notep  pThe number being guessed should be established by the Server once both Clients are connected and must be a randomlychosen integer between 1 and 99.p  pBoth Clients should display a message every time a guess is entered by either client, and both should also display a message depending on how close the guess was.p  pUserfriendliness is very important. Please make your programs lookandfeel very userfriendly.p  pWhen establishing a connection, its usually best in this sort of environment to use localhost as the connecting for the ServerSocket and the Client.p  pMake sure that all sockets are closed when the connection is terminated. Leaving sockets andor IO streams open is bad practice.p  pMake sure that your Client program validates userentries to ensure that theyre valid integers.p  hr

In my codeonCreatecode method, I add rows in my codeCategorycode table, because I believed that the onCreate method is only called once in the lifetime of the application, i.e., when it is run the first time, for creating the databases. That is why in my codeonCreatecode method I add data into my codeCATEGORYcode table, because I wanted it to have some initial data.p  pAnd I believed when we make substituent calls to codegetReadableDatabasecode and codegetWritableDatabasecode it returns us a copy of the earlier created database for us to work with, or probably a handle to the original database and on completion saves those changes. But, after reading your answer it seems that the codeonCreatecode methods are run every time. If they are run everytime where does the data get stored, since we will loose the database when we close itp

Negative 1533 pI am trying to make a website with a minimalist feeling to it, so I put a fullscreen image on the background as codebackgroundimagecode of codebodycode. I have a codetransition backgroundposition 1scode set as a CSS rule for codebodycode and an easing function, to create a smooth scrolling effect when going to other pages in the same HTML file I have no actual scrollbar, just navigation elements. The thing I noticed was that once I started scrolling, the memory reserved by the page went from a small 77MB to over 500MB I tested this in Firefox, but it doesnt seem to happen either because pages have no separate processes or memory allocation works differently, I imagine. Why does this happen in Google Chrome and not in other browsers And how can I reduce the enormous amounts of memory reserved by my pagep  pTo give some information on what I am usingp  ul liBrowser Google Chrome li lipRAM 8GB The page uses javascript with the following plugins p  ul lijQuery li liBootstrapli ulli liBackground image dimensions are 1440 x 540li ul  pA few possible causes of the problemp  ul liThe image is too big to be rendered with a codetransitioncode and an easing function.li liI should not use codebackgroundimagecode for this, but create a new codeltimggtcode as a background.li liI somehow only checked it with developer tools open in Chrome, increasing the memory allocated.li liIts not the image causing the problem, but the web fonts I scroll simultaneously with the background image, also using transition and an easing function.li ul  pAnd I want to add that maybe this is not even a problem after all, its just that I have never seen a page go over 300MB with memory allocation.p

When user jill makes a commit, jills identity should be used.p  pThe reason why I want to use the same repository is because its the content of a website, and Apache is looking in varwww.

However, I get most of the text of the original XML with a whole lot of Nothing thrown in. In other words, I am apparently matching the FP nodes, but the when statements are not being satisfied for some reason. p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltxslstylesheet version1.0 xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransformgt ltxsloutput methodxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 indentyesgt     ltxsltemplate matchgt     ltxslapplytemplatesgt     ltxsltemplategt      ltxsltemplate matchFPgt         ltxslchoosegt             ltxslwhen testSourceFP2gt             ltxslvalueof select.gtn             ltxslwhengt         ltxslwhen testSourceFP1gt             ltxslif test EReason for Control or EReasons for Controlgt                 ltxslvalueof select.gtn             ltxslifgt         ltxslwhengt         ltxslotherwisegt             Nothing         ltxslotherwisegt         ltxslchoosegt     ltxsltemplategt  ltxslstylesheetgt codepre  pI believe that if I can obtain a 1D list as described above, that I would be able to later get this into a Filemaker database.

Negative 1533 pI ran into a problem where javascript popup windows from WebBrowser controlc are not showing up on screen.

In other words If I am on a different tab other than WebBrowser control tab I cannot see the pops and they are lost.  p  pAfter few hours of research I have found that the root cause of this problem could be the windowstyle attributes with which an AddInProcess is initialized with. Also, the WebBrowser control may not have a window of its own and could be the reason for popups not showing up.I believe, ref from a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comSystem.AddInSystemAddinHostingAddInProcess.cs relnofollowherea that some attributes are hard coded into AddInProcess during initialization Start.  p  pThe below 2 attributes seems to be relevant to me that are hardcoded. p  precodeaddInProcess.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow  true addInProcess.StartInfo.UseShellExecute  false codepre  pI am trying to display the popup windows irrespective of the visibility of the Browser window or the host application tab in which it exists.

Negative 1533 h2Questionh2  pHow can one redirect to another page when serversentevent is finished in Flask and on server sidep  h3Problem descriptionh3  pAn EventSource was implemented on client side code JavaScript and a Response was returned on server side code Flask, Python. The EventSource will be closed if the last item from server was sent. I cant see a clear solution to redirect to another site via server side code. Maybe the answer is simple, but Im not getting it.p  h3Similar problemh3  pA similar question is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30645664howtostopserversenteventsHow to stop ServerSent Eventsa and one possible answer in the comment a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7636165howdoserversenteventsactuallywork1199886811998868How do serversent events actually worka.

I also didnt get it.p  pstrongEDITstrong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11597367howdoicloseaserversendeventsconnectioninflaskHow do I close a ServerSend Events connection in Flaska is strongly related to this question.

Negative 1533 pI am trying to create a custom function of given a date in Filemaker, I would like it to determine if this week of fiscal year number is within the first week of quarter else it will calculate the first date next quarter. Our Fiscal year starts on July 1p  pSo for defined requirements our FY starts on July 1 and Qtrs are on week  1, 14, 27, 40 our weeks go from 152 and the week starts on Tuesday Defined as day 3. If FY starts on Monday than the first week will be from MonTues Therefore a shortweek then week 2 will be a full 7 day week.p  pExample If I have a date 09092011 that would be week 11 in Q1, therefore since it is not the first week of the quarter I would like the following date for the next Qtr which would be Wk 14 first date of 9272011. So my evaluation needs to determine whether the given date is within the first week of a qtr weeks 1, 14, 27, 40 or provide the first week of the next qtr. p  pAlso here is the initial CF I was working with from Brian Dunnings site.p  pa hrefhttpswww.briandunning.comcf147 relnofollowhttpswww.briandunning.comcf147ap  pI know this would be developed in filemaker but there maybe something developed in another language which may apply...p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1533 pHey guys I need your helpp  pI am working on an errorpattern recognition algorithm. The program I am working on produces an array with data, per second, this data gets filtered and a second array is created , which is filled with boolean values. every value, stands for a secondstep and indicates if the value at that second was filtered. p  pthe algorithm I am working on should summarize parts of the array where the filtered rate is quite high. so it should dedect parts which contain a lot of filtered data, because this data should be removed later.p  pI have implemented 2 different methods, one is to create a distance map, which contains the distance to the next filtered step. so it looks like this [5,4,3,2,1,0,0]. 0 stands for a filtered step.  then  I am iterating through the array and and expand a window as long as the distance to the next filtered step is below a certain thresholde.g 12. If its above that threshold, it is checked if the window is bigger than the minimum window sizee.g. 300. If its bigger than the start and end indices are saved, otherwise the window is ignored. at the end there is one more check if the percentage of filtered steps in each window is above a certain threshold.p  pthe second alogorithm is like a sliding window, it starts with the minimum window sizee.g. 300 and iterated through the array, calculating the percentage of filtered steps in the window and as long as its above a threshold, the window gets expanded. if it drops below the threshold, there is one more back iteration which skips the not filtered steps at the end of the current window.p  pMy question is, do you know a better way to recognice big amounts of filtered data, or do you know which thresholds I should take  The data is around 40k  100k seconds long.p  pthanks guys and sorry for the long explanation.p

Negative 1533 pI am trying to lock my screen orientation to horizontal view for the whole app always. I added a config.xml line that readsp  pp  pbut it doesnt have any affect when I test it. Does this need to be in a certain place in the xml, before or after other things Also, I am testing using the Ionic lab view in the browser and the Ionic view app on my phone, could either of these not implement the xmlp  pFurther more, I have also tried the cordova screen orientation plugin with no luck.
