Negative 452 pMy company has a requirement that all production sites pass an AppScan security scan. Sometimes, when we scan a SharePoint installation, the software detects a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Im pretty sure this is a false positiveAppScan is probably interpreting some other activity in the HTTP response as success of the blind injection. But its difficult to prove that this is the case.p  pI suspect that SharePoint, both MOSS 07 and WSS 3.0, uses stored procedures exclusively behind the scenes. Does anyone know if there is any documentation from Microsoft to this effect, and furthermore, whether any of the stored procedures use dynamicallygenerated SQL If everything were sprocs, and none of them dynamic, we would have pretty good evidence that SharePoint has no SQL injection vulnerability.p

Negative 452 pI have a Java class that looks like thisp  precodepublic class MyABC    int a0   boolean Btrue    static   Initialize and load existing data only once at startup          need to know if its called from its own main       or by another class to conditionally set veriables       public MyABCint AA,boolean BB           public static void mainString[] args         MyABC myabc  new MyABC3,true     codepre  pBecause the static block is run when the class is loaded, how can I detect if its called from its own codemaincode or by another class to conditionally set variablesp  phr p  pI understand when some of you said All sorts of bells go off Well, its because I got a situation Im designing a class that needs to load lots of data to the limit of my PC 4G Ram, and Im running 32bit version of Java which can only use 1.5G of Ram max so when I test this class by itself, I need to load as much data as possible to test all possible situations, but when it is called from multiple other classes, it cant do that would cause out of heap space error, so it should only load min. data needed. And yet since all the data should only be loaded once at start up, it should be in the static block otherwise I need to implement extra logic to detect if its being loaded the first time need to load data, or 2nd, 3rd time shouldnt load data again and again. And if I implement extra logic to do that and move the data load code out of the static block, it would cause unnecessary complexity because if I move to 64bit version of java hopefully soon, that extra complexity would be extra burden Ill have enough space to load all data even when being called from other classes. So the temp quick fix is to detect it in the static block and handle the difference accordingly, when I have enough space, just comment them out without the need to change programming logic structure.p  pThanks for all the answers and advices, I tried the StackTraceElement approach, it works great It solved my problem.p

Negative 452 pFor the purpose of this discussion, there are two kinds of parameters an object constructor might take state dependency or service dependency.  Supplying a service dependency with an IOC container is easy DI takes over.  But in contrast, state dependencies are usually only known to the client.  That is, the object requestor.p  pIt turns out that having a client supply the state params through an IOC Container is quite painful.  I will show several different ways to do this, all of which have big problems, and ask the community if there is another option Im missing.  Lets beginp  pBefore I added an IOC container to my project code, I started with a class like thisp  precodeclass Foobar     parameters are state dependencies, not service dependencies    public Foobarstring alpha, int omega...    ...other stuff  codepre  pI decide to add a Logger service depdendency to the Foobar class, which perhaps Ill provide through DIp  precodeclass Foobar      public Foobarstring alpha, int omega, ILogger log...     ...other stuff  codepre  pBut then Im also told I need to make class Foobar itself swappable.  That is, Im required to servicelocate a Foobar instance.  I add a new interface into the mixp  precodeclass Foobar  IFoobar      public Foobarstring alpha, int omega, ILogger log...     ...other stuff  codepre  pWhen I make the service locator call, it will DI the ILogger service dependency for me.  Unfortunately the same is not true of the state dependencies Alpha and Omega.  Some containers offer a syntax to address thisp  precodeUnity 2.0 pseudoish code myContainer.ResolveltIFoobargt    new parameterOverride[]  alpha, one, omega,2    codepre  pI like the feature, but I dont like that it is untyped and not evident to the developer what parameters must be passed via intellisense, etc.  So I look at another solutionp  precodeThis is a boiler plate heavy approach class Foobar  IFoobar     public Foobar string alpha, int omega...    ...stuff  class FoobarFactory  IFoobarFactory     public IFoobar IFoobarFactory.Createstring alpha, int omega       return new Foobaralpha, omega       fetch it... myContainer.ResolveltIFoobarFactorygt.Createone, 2 codepre  pThe above solves the typesafety and intellisense problem, but it 1 forced class Foobar to fetch an ILogger through a service locator rather than DI and 2 it requires me to make a bunch of boilerplate XXXFactory, IXXXFactory for all varieties of Foobar implementations I might use.  Should I decide to go with a pure service locator approach, it may not be a problem.  But I still cant stand all the boilerplate needed to make this work.p  pSo then I try another variation of containerprovided supportp  precodeoverall, this is a pseudomemento pattern. class Foobar  IFoobar     public Foobar FoobarParams parms       this.alpha  parms.alpha       this.omega  parms.omega        ...stuff   class FoobarParams    public FoobarParamsstring alpha, int omega...   fetch an instance FoobarParams parms  new FoobarParamsone,2 Unity 2.0 pseudocode... myContainer.resolveltIFoobargtnew parameterOverrideparms  codepre  pWith this approach, Ive halfway recovered my intellisense.  But I must wait till runtime to detect the error where I might forget to supply the FoobarParams parameter.  p  pSo lets try a new approachp  precodecode named concrete creator class Foobar  IFoobar      public Foobarstring alpha, int omega, ILogger log...     static IFoobar Createstring alpha, int omega        unity 2.0 pseudoish code.  Assume a common        service locator, or singleton holds the container...        return Container.ResolveltIFoobargt            new parameterOverride[] alpha, alpha,omega, omega                 Get my instance Foobar.Createalpha,2 codepre  pI actually dont mind that Im using the concrete Foobar class to create an IFoobar.  It represents a base emconceptem that I dont expect to change in my code.  I also dont mind the lack of typesafety in the static Create, because it is now encapsulated.  My intellisense is working too  Any concrete instance made this way will ignore the supplied state params if they dont apply a Unity 2.0 behavior.  Perhaps a different concrete implementation FooFoobar might have a formal arg name mismatch, but Im still pretty happy with it.p  pBut the big problem with this approach is that it only works effectively with Unity 2.0 a mismatched parameter in Structure Map will throw an exception.  So it is good only if I stay with Unity.  The problem is, Im beginning to like Structure Map a lot more.  So now I go onto yet another optionp  precodeclass Foobar  IFoobar, IFoobarInit     public FoobarILogger log...     public IFoobar IFoobarInit.Initializestring alpha, int omega       this.alpha  alpha        this.omega  omega       return this       now create it...      IFoobar foo  myContainer.resolveltIFoobarInitgt.Initializeone, 2 codepre  pNow with this Ive got a somewhat nice compromise with the other approaches 1 My arguments are typesafe  intellisense aware 2 I have a choice of fetching the ILogger via DI shown above or service locator, 3 there is no need to make one or more seperate concrete FoobarFactory classes contrast with the verbose boilerplate example code earlier, and 4 it reasonably upholds the principle make interfaces easy to use correctly, and hard to use incorrectly.  At least it arguably is no worse than the alternatives previously discussed.p  pOne acceptance barrier yet remains I also want to apply design by contract.p  pEvery sample I presented was intentionally favoring constructor injection for state dependencies because I want to preserve invariant support as most commonly practiced.  Namely, the invariant is established when the constructor completes.  p  pIn the sample above, the invarient is not established when object construction completes.  As long as Im doing homegrown design by contract I could just tell developers not to test the invariant until the Initialize... method is called.p  pBut more to the point, when .net 4.0 comes out I want to use its code contract support for design by contract.  From what I read, it will not be compatible with this last approach.p  pCursesp  pOf course it also occurs to me that my entire philosophy is off.  Perhaps Id be told that conjuring a Foobar  IFoobar via a service locator implies that it is a service  and services only have other service dependencies, they dont have state dependencies such as the Alpha and Omega of these examples.  Im open to listening to such philosophical matters as well, but Id also like to know what semiauthorative reference to read that would steer me down that thought path. p  pSo now I turn it to the community.  What approach should I consider that I havnt yet  Must I really believe Ive exhausted my optionsp  pp.s. This kind of problem, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2634675ioccontainersandidisposablealong with othersa, prompts me to believe the whole IOC Container idea, at least in .net, is premature.  It reminds me of the days when people would stand on their heads to make the C language feel objectoriented adding weird macros and such.  What we should be looking for is CLR and language support of IOC Containers.  For example, imagine a new kind of interface called an initiate.  An initiate works like an interface, but requires a particular constructor signature as well.  The rest I leave as an exercise to the student... p

Negative 452 pBeing one of the most popular NoSQL solutions MongoDB has most of the advantages of this approach. But one issue Im still struggling with is how reflect object relations in NoSQL data store, specifically  MongoDB.p  pFor example, lets consider a simple data model User, Post and Comment. It is clear to me that comments have no value on their own and thus become embedded objects for Posts. But when it comes to users  that becomes tricky because User is an entity on its own, not coupled with Post. Now in case I need to list posts with user full names and links to profiles on a web page, I would need to have a list of posts and information about posts authors name and id at least.p  pI see 2 possible solutions herep  ol liDenormalize the data in a way that each post entry contains its authors ID and full name and any other user attributes I might need when listing posts. This way I would make querying for the data really simple but wheneve user updates hisher profile I would need to update all the posts by the user as well. But then I need to also store user attributes in the comments objects which means that updating user profile essentially requires me to update all the posts that have at least one comment by the user unless I want to store comments in a separate collections.li liOnly store user ID in the post object and run 2 queries one to get a list of posts and another one to get list of users where user id is in the list of post authors. This requires  2 queries and extra processing in my application code to map users to the posts.li ol  pIm sure Im not the first one facing this issue but unfortunately I have not found any best practices on this topic so far.

Running the original Python script from the Tweet A Watt software iwattcher.pyi outputs a similar reading of the XBee packet, but with 19 distinct samples.  This is the state Im trying to get to in Processing.p  pIn the XBee API Library, the getAnalog and getAnalogn functions are defined as followsp  pregetAnalog  returns an array of integers that represents the current state of each analog channel with 1 indicating that the channel is not configured for analog. Use this when there is only one sample per frame.  getAnalogint n  returns the nth sample of analog data as an array of integers with 1 indicating that the channel is not configured for analog.pre  pIm using stronggetAnalogint nstrong in the strongforstrong loop.  Is the issue that I am only getting one frame of data, in the call to bXBeeDataFrame data  xbee.getXBeeReadingb   p  pIve also tried reading the Serial packet directly without using the XBee API Library with reference to httpwww.tigoe.netpcompcodecategoryProcessing8, httpprocessing.orgreferencelibrariesserialSerial.html, and httpssdl.stanford.edussdlimagesstoriesAA2360708ALabRoverPartsxbeeproproductmanual.pdf, but my lack of experience in this area makes this a bit of a nonstarter.p  pIf anyone familiar with the XBee packet, the XBee API Library, or reading Serial data in Processing can assist, it would be greatly appreciated.  I expect that the data is there, Im just not accessing it correctly.  I realize this is quite a specific question, and Ive posted it in the Adafruit makers of the Tweet A Watt kit  a hrefhttpforums.adafruit.comviewtopic.phpf40ampt16067ampsid4e34727fa59b7c7d589564d2d6b85e46 relnofollowhttpforums.adafruit.comviewtopic.phpf40ampt16067ampsid4e34727fa59b7c7d589564d2d6b85e46a and Processing httpprocessing.orgdiscourseyabb2YaBB.plnum1276111549 forums, but after dozens of views I havent had any replies, so I figured Id cast the net a little wider.p  pIf Ive left out anything that would be helpful, please let me know.

Negative 452 pI am in the process of creating an app in which a customer can add email addresses to an event. This means that each email address is sent 2 urls via email when added to the list, 1 url to accept and the other to decline.

Negative 452 pIve been stuck for hours trying to render a Core Animation layer tree into an OpenGL context using CARenderer. The OpenGL context is currently provided by a NSOpenGLView subclass set up in Interface Builder, with settings on default.p  pHeres how I set up the CALayers in my examplep  precodel1  [[CALayer layer] retain]         l1 is an instance variable l1.bounds  CGRectMake0, 0, 100, 100 l1.backgroundColor  CGColorCreateGenericRGB1, 1, 0, 1 CALayer l2  [CALayer layer] l2.bounds  CGRectMake0, 0, 20, 20 l2.backgroundColor  CGColorCreateGenericRGB1, 0, 0, 1 l2.position  CGPointMake50, 50 [l1 addSublayerl2] codepre  pIf I add these to a regular NSView, they show up just fine.p  pHeres the drawing code from my NSOpenGLView subclassp  precode void drawRectNSRectdirtyRect      NSRect frame  [self frame]       set up context according to CARenderer.h instructions     glViewport0, 0, frame.size.width, frame.size.height     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION     glLoadIdentity     glOrtho0, frame.size.width, 0, frame.size.height, 1, 1      glClearColor0, 0, 0, 0     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT      if l1              CARenderer renderer  [CARenderer rendererWithCGLContext[[self openGLContext] CGLContextObj] optionsnil]         renderer.layer  l1         renderer.bounds  NSRectToCGRectframe         [renderer beginFrameAtTime0.0 timeStampNULL]         [renderer addUpdateRectrenderer.bounds]         [renderer render]         [renderer endFrame]           glFlush  codepre  pI verified that the view is redrawn after the layers have been created, and the view itself seems to work okay  OpenGL commands I issue show correctly. The CARenderer does come alive in fact, if l1 is already attached to another context at the time this code runs, it will dutifully complain. Theres just no visible output, ever.p  pOther things Ive tried wrapping the CARenderer code in a CATransaction, fiddling with the NSOpenGLView setup options in Interface Builder, rendering the whole affair into a manually created OpenGL context offscreen and saving that into an image file... all to the same effect native OpenGL commands show fine, CARenderer shows nothing.p  pI suspect that theres something wrong with the way my OpenGL context is set up, or that I might even somehow be rendering outside of my viewport... probably some really stupid minor detail. Unfortunately, both documentation and sample code for CARenderer on the web is somewhat sparse, and while Im fairly experienced with Core Animation, my OpenGL knowledge is decidedly limited.p  pSo right now, Im seriously stumped and completely out of ideas, so any pointers are greatly appreciatedp  pCheersp

Negative 452 pFor ages now my site has had a catalogue where the small image is directly within a link within a div. The link must only be around the image  but I do not want to use the  selector since this is not supported by some versions of IE IE6 onwards I think it needs to support. The div has class ImageHoverSpan it used to be a Span on an older layout, I just havent bothered renaming the class. There is another div, with class ImageOuterPanel, on the same level as the link i.e. a direct child of the ImageHoverSpan.p  pI have the following classes definedp  precode  .ImageHoverSpan .ImageOuterPanel      display none    .customer .ImageHoverSpanhover .ImageOuterPanel      display block  codepre  pThis certainly used to work fine as far as I can remember  on all browsers. I am about to launch the new version of the website into testing, but I just noticed today that, in Opera 10.60, the image panel ImageOuterPanel is displaying straight away on hover over the ImageHoverSpan, but it takes anything between 1 second and.. well.. never to disappear when the mouse leaves the div.p  pI know using hover on anything other than links can slow performance in IE  but this is Opera. In Firefox 3.6 this works absolutely fine  it appears and disappears as it should.p  pHas anyone got any ideas about what could be causing this Anyone had this problem beforep  pThank you.p  pRegards,p  pRichardp

Negative 452 pIm implementing a few graph algorithms at the moment and am wanting a container with the complexity of a fibonacci heap or a relaxed heap specifically I want at least OlogN for push and pop and O1 for reducekey.p  pIm not keen on implementing this myself if at all possible development and testing overhead and time and I notice that the boost graph library references a couple of likely looking datastructures in the pending directory. The relaxed heap in relaxedheap.hpp looks the ticket, but I cant quite work out how to use it. It has the following public functions precised a little for clarityp  precodevoid pushconst valuetypeamp x valuetypeamp top void pop codepre  pWhich are clear enough and implement my desired push and pop. Additionally there arep  precodevoid updateconst valuetypeamp x void removeconst valuetypeamp x codepre  pIm presuming that I can implement a reducekey using update but Im not clear how. My particular issue is that I assume the value is copied upon calling push. What I feel I need is a pointer to the copy of the value in the heap so that I can modify it by reference and then call update to have it shuffled back to where it belongs. However such a pointer does not seem to be availablep  pAnyone with experience of relaxed heaps in general, or boost relaxed heaps in particular willing to put me out of my misery with an explanation or a nice code snippetp  pThanks,p  pAlexp

Negative 452 pWere developing a web site.

The question is, should we start actually using it for real ie beyond just evaluating it, actually using it for our development and relying on itp  pAs alpha software, it obviously isnt ready for release yet... but then nor is our own code. It is open source, and we have the skills needed to debug it, so we could in theory actually contribute bug fixes back.p  pBut on the other hand, we dont know what the release schedule for it is they havent published one yet, and while I feel okay developing with it, I wouldnt be so sure about using it in production so if it isnt ready before we are then it may delay our own launch.p  pWhat do you think Is it worth taking the risk Do you have any experiences good or bad of similar situationsp  p[EDIT] Ive deliberately not specified the language were using or the devtool in question in order to keep the scope of the question broad, as I feel its a question that can apply to pretty much any dev environment.p  p[EDIT2] Thank you to Marjan for the very helpful reply.

Negative 452 pThis is a problem Ive just run into, or rather its a simplification that captures the core problem.p  pImagine I have a spreadsheet containing a number of columns, each of them labeled, and a number of rows.p  pI want to determine when the value in one column can be inferred from the value in another.  For example, we might find that every time a 1 appears in column strongastrong, a 5 always appears in column strongdstrong, but whenever a 2 appears in column strongastrong, a 3 always appears in column strongdstrong.  We observe that the value in column strongastrong reliably predicts the value in column strongcstrong.p  pThe goal is to identify all such relationships between columns.p  pThe naive solution is to start with a list of all pairs of columns, a, b, a, c, a, d... b, c, b, d... and so on.  We call these the eligible list.p  pFor each of these pairs, we keep track of the value of the first in the pair, and the corresponding value in the second.  If we notice that we see the same value for the first of a pair, but a different value for the second of a pair, then this pair is nolonger eligible.p  pWhatever is left at the end of this process is the set of valid relationships.p  pUnfortunately, this rapidly becomes impractical as the number of columns increases, as the amount of data we must store is in the order of the number of columns squared.p  pCan anyone think of an efficient way to do thisp

Ive read a number of posts on this site but Im still confused as to the best way to approach my problemp  p[1] In .NET 3.5, is codeThreadPoolcode the only way for a program to exploit the multicores in the machine  i.e. Is it possible to spawn threads on different cores using codenew Threadcode p  p[2] My case I have codeListltCalculationgtcodethat contains around 80 items, currently processed sequentially. So given that Im using .NET 3.5 and based on what Ive read, codeThreadPoolcode is probably my best bet for multithreading due to the high number of threads, howeverp  ul liThere is a lot of dependency between the Calculations. Currently, the list is ordered in a way that all required Calculations are performed in the beginning.li ul  pThis is how the dependency of the work items looks like details not important, just wanted to make a point on the complexity of the dependenciesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW3xej.png altalt textp  ul liCalculation times are vastly different, one Calculation object might just involve retrieval of a value , other Calculation objects would involve a lot of work in nested loops...etcli ul  pHow do I prioritize the main codeCalculationscode that have something like 10 other work items depending on it  What is the most efficient way of signaling to use p  pThank you.p  pEdit I should mention that codeListltCalculationgtcode remains fixed. However, computing the 80 calculations is called x million times. Every time an iterator is updated, Calculate is invoked on every codeCalculationcode in the list.p
Negative 452 pIm wondering what solutionsoptions I might have for managing user authentication and authorization with AD Im in a situation where we want to use AD accountsgroupsetc to manage our users, both internal and external.  I found this article a hrefhttpblog.waleedmohamed.net200912createactivedirectoryserviceusing.html relnofollowhttpblog.waleedmohamed.net200912createactivedirectoryserviceusing.htmla that shows a simple WCF Service exposing some AD operations. p  pMy thought is to create an AD WCF Service which multiple apps can consume for account CRUD operations and other needed functions like logging in and password retrieval. Is this a good idea to have a service with this much power Were thinking about having the service use an account that only has permissions on certain OUs to limit its power.p  pThanksp
Negative 452 pIm looking for a definitive answer if indeed one exists on how much memory should be allocated when creating a static chunks of shared memory via codeboostinterprocesscodes codemanagedsharedmemorycode.

Negative 452 pI can currently display all of the release years for all of the films in the database. A user can pick a year and see all of the films released in that year.

So like ..p  precodeif  myself       return employee  session.QueryltEmployeegt        .Fetchcontext gt context.Address        .Take1        .SingleOrDefault  else    return employee  session.QueryltEmployeegt        .Denycontext gt context.Address        .Denycontext gt context.Salary        .Take1        .SingleOrDefault codepre  pThen my View might look like ..p  precodemodel Employee  lth2gtModel.Namelth2gt lth4gtHtml.DisplayFor model gt model.Address lth4gt lth4gtModel.Salarylth4gt codepre  pI realize this isnt the best example in the universe, but is such a thing possible I havent found any methods that explicitly tell an object not to return, so far. p

Negative 452 pI am recently using JSON to store configuration parameters for a certain number of subclasses of the same class. To keep a uniform interface, I have provided the parent class with public codevoid setParameterString, Stringcode and codeString getParameterStringcode methods. Each subclass, then, casts the provided parameters to their native type and do some kind of computation using them.p  pNow, I am wondering since I already store each parameter inside a HashMap, does it really makes sense to keep a separate field with the right type for each parameter What is the computational overhead of converting String parameters to their native type each time I need them, given that I need to use them very oftenp  pThank youbr  Tunnuzp
Negative 452 pI have a C program, which has an strongAgentstrong class. The program creates several Agents, and each Agent has a emrunem method, which executes a Task i.e. emTask.Factory.StartNewem....br Each Agent performs some calculations, and then needs to wait for all the other Agents to finish their calculations, before proceeding to the next stage his actions will be based according to the calculations of the others.br In order to make an Agent wait, I have created a CancellationTokenSource named tokenSource, and in order to alert the program that this Agent is going to sleep, I threw an event. Thus, the 2 consecutive commands are  p  precode1 OnWaitingForAgentsnew EventArgs 2 tokenSource.Token.WaitHandle.WaitOne codepre  pThe event is caught by an strongAgentManagerstrong class, which is a thread in itself, and the 2nd command makes the Agent Task thread sleep until a signal will be received for the Cancellation Token.p  pEach time the above event is fired, the AgentManager class catches it, and adds 1 to a counter. If the number of the counter equals the number of Agents used in the program, the AgentManager which holds a reference to all Agents wakes each one up as follows p  precodeagent.TokenSource.Cancel codepre  pNow we reach my problem The 1st command is executed asynchronously by an Agent, then due to a context switch between threads, the AgentManager seems to catch the event, and goes on to wake up all the Agents. BUT  the current Agent has not even reached the 2nd command yet  Thus, the Agent is receiving a wake up signal, and only then does he go to sleep, which means he gets stuck sleeping with no one to wake him up Is there a way to atomize the 2 consecutive methods together, so no context switch will happen, thus forcing the Agent to go to sleep before the AgentManager has the chance to wake him upp

Specifically, I want to update a progress bar with the position of the song so the service should be able to give that information back to the client activity.

This is of course not what I want with a music player. I have therefore tried both binding the service and sending commands with an intent using startService.

Negative 452 pThis isnt clever nor fun but Im stuck. A client of mine requires the need for a download of a presentation web site where videos can be embedded. Since OGG is a pretty obscure format for clients I ask them to upload MPEG4 encoded videos as either .mov, .mp4 or .m4v. These can be played using the HTML codeltvideogtcode or for browsers that dont support MPEG4 I use a Flash player since that can play them.p  pThis is fine for online and it works well.p  pWhen we go to download the presentation, the codeltvideogtcode element works fine in browsers that support MPEG4 video, even if theyre local. p  pSo we then come on to FireFox this doesnt support MPEG4. Nor can I get Flash to locally play a video because of security issues, unless we get them to go through the security settings but that isnt very nice.p  pSo we resorted to using the good ol codeltembedgtcode tag but this is very buggy with FireFox. It works fine on a server, it even allows me to have custom controls, but locally the videos dont play.p  pIve had some Googling around and it seems like a security issue but want to get a definite answer. Does anyone know why its not playing locally The URL is fine and the file exists. I notice that its common amongst version 4 so could it be a codec issue Is there another way I can get FireFox to play MPEG4s locallyp

Negative 452 pI am trying to subclass str object, and add couple of methods to it. My main purpose is to learn how to do it. Where I am stuck is, am I supposed to subclass string in a metaclass, and create my class with that meta, or subclass str directly And also, I guess I need to implement codenewcode somehow, because, my custom methods will modify my string object, and will return new mystr obj. Thanks in advance.p  h2Edith2  pMy classs methods, should be completely chainable with str methods, and should always return a new my class instance when custom methods modified it.

Negative 452 pIm using the codeRawPrinterHelpercode class from Microsoft, a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb322091 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb322091a, to print to a Zebra KR403 printer from C code, and everything is working fine. p  pI wish to monitor the status of the printer for paper jams and paper outages. Ive found a query that I can send to the printer, HQES or esc eng 6, that will return everything I need. The problem is that I can not figure out how to send this query to the printer that will allow the printer to respond. The codeWritePrintercode in the codeRawPrinterHelpercode class only seems to return a bool or long type. p  pI also tried using a codeWin32printercode object to find the codePrinterStatusPrinterStateErrorscode of the printer. using the following methodp  precodepublic static string PrinterStateCheckstring szPrinterName              string query  string.FormatSELECT  from Win32Printer WHERE Name LIKE 0, szPrinterName         ManagementObjectSearcher searcher  new ManagementObjectSearcherquery         ManagementObjectCollection collection  searcher.Get         string errorName           foreach ManagementObject printer in collection                      int state  Convert.ToInt32printer[PrinterState]             errorName  state.ToString                  return errorName codepre  pUtilizing this method, I tried getting the codePrinterStatecode, codePrinterStatuscode, and codeDetectedErrorStatecode, but none of these respond with the information I need. codePrinterStatecode always returns a code1024code, codePrinterStatuscode always returns a code4code, and codeDetectedErrorStatecode always returns a code2code. Though codePrinterStatecode did return a code0code on a proper printing and code1024code on a paperjam or media out event for a few prints, now it just returns code1024code on every call.p  pI have also found that Zebra created their own software for monitoring printers on a network. The problem is our printers are not on a network and are only connected to the client computer via USB. Also, we are hoping to check the status of the printer prior to or after each receipt is printed.p  pI am hoping there is something from the codewinspool.Drvcode that I can use to send raw data to the printer and receive data back from the printer.p  pNow Im using the codeReadPrintercode function of the codewinspool.Drvcode, but the function is returning code0code which means that a response from the printer cannot be accessed. This usually means that the printer is not setup for bidirectional communication, but Im  sure that it is. The Enable bidirectional support check box is checked in the Ports tab of the Printer Properties. Also, the Zebra Setup Utilities can correctly query the printer and receive a response in its Direct Communication window.p  pThanks for any advice,p  pJeremyp

Negative 452 pIve got a web app that tracks page views. The app checks the IP address of the enduser and maps it to a Country. Everything works here so far. p  pHowever, I am realizing that this table called codeviewscode is getting populated very fast, since it tracks every page view. On some pages reaching 500k, 1M, etc. Which could potentially store over millions of records on this table within a short time.p  pI thought about aggregating the results every 24 hours into a new table called codecountryviewscode and then deleting the records in codeviewscode.p  pSo for example. My codeviewscode table could look likep  precodepageid  countryid  createdat  updatedat       1        1           201111...  201111... 1        2           201111...  201111... 1        1           201111...  201111... 1        1           201111...  201111... 2        4           201111...  201111... 2        3           201111...  201111... codepre  pAfter 24 hours.

Negative 452 pI am working on an application which need to notify around 100 people at once when a strongspecificstrong condition is met. Now when a user who is performing the action which results in the strongspecificstrong condition need to wait till all 100 emails are sent which takes quite long using Gmail SMTP. The application is built on top of Cake PHP.p  pMy question is whether there is a way application can send 100 emails without blocking the user whose action results in meeting the strongspecificstrong condition.p  pTo make my question clear, think of Groupon. It sends notification to all buyers when minimum numbers of buyers are met. So when the nth person make the purchase, Google sends the notification.One way is to notify all buyers immediately after the purchase is complete which is what we are doing n context of our application and probably other way is to wait and send the notification using an external scriptapp at a predefined time. p  pIn case of former, the application would block while sending emails is complete. Since PHP deosnt support multithreading, I was wondering if there is an easy way to make this operation asynchoronous so it doesnt affect main application flow.p

Negative 452 pI am using jQuery to submit my form via AJAX. This updates a database record and then returns a response for success or failure.

This is not the behavior I want. The reason I want to change this is because if I submit the form and I then decide to change the value again then I decide I want to reset the form back to my last submitted values, it resets back to the initial defaults and not my new values that were recently submitted and saved in the database.p  pTo try and better explain this I will show my process with the form field for a users username.p  precodeUsername SomeDefaultUserNameFetched codepre  pI then change the username to Foo.p  precodeUsername Foo codepre  pI submit the form via AJAX and get a success response.

Negative 452 pI am trying to repackage a small game I made for Android to be used on the Blackberry Playbook.p  pI was able to repackage it and deploy to the Blackberry Simulator on vmware just fine, except the redrawing on the simulator just behaves very strangely.  For example I get a lot of flickering when things redraw.  And sometimes half the screen draws and the other half doesnt. Sometimes the bottom portion of the screen disappears and all the images get shifted up.p  pThis mostly seems to happen when Im swapping button images, or using ImageView to do little animations and such.p  pHas anyone else experienced this  Is it a simulator issue, or will it occur on the Playbook as well  Any idea how to fixp

Negative 452 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions122883interfaceswhycantiseemtograspthemInterfaces Why can39t I seem to grasp thema  p blockquote    pI have seen many different types of answers on what is interface techical, c and why is it there.etc.. p  pToday i want to ask you guys question whether below my understanding is correct  p  pYou will implement an Interface on class A when you want your consumer classes say classes B,C,D,E to use class A for a reason and that reason is Interface name.p  pLets say class A has functionality to can Delete Employee work history Data and as well it can delete Employee skillset data. This class A has non null property called EmployeeIdp  pNow you will implement 2 interfaces IDeleteWorkHistroy and IDeleteSkillSet and implement them in class Ap  pAll the consumer classes B,C,D... will talk to your class only through these two interfaces and they wont directly use instance of class A anywhere in the applicationp  pe.g.         in class B wants to delete only employee work history                   IDeleteWorkhistory EmpWH  new class Aempid  and everywhere else in class B you will use EmpWH and nothing else of class A.p  pBasically consumers of your class will use only that thing which he needs or other way consumer will talk to that interface which is needed by him. p  pIn other words keyboard is interface of your Computer  if you want to talk to your computer you wont need a bit sequencer where you you pass bit by bit information to CPU using interrupts..though , ideally , you can do it. You will talk to your machine using proper interface only.p  pSo any class that you are writing , write proper interfaces so that the consumers will talk to your class in standard way.p  pPlease let me know if my understanding is correct or needs modifications p

Negative 452 pWe are reaching an ASP.NET web application with WCF from Windows Phone. We use WIF on the server, the users of the application get the FedAuth cookie when they authenticate themselves with a WCF request. Afterwards we use the same cookie for every subsequent request to keep the user authenticated on the phone.p  pThese cookies are HttpOnly, so they are not accessible directly, but that is not a problem, since we can share a codeCookieContainercode object with every WCF service client.p  pHowever, we need to use a codeBackgroundTransferRequestcode to download a file from the server, where we also need to authenticate the user with the FedAuth cookie. But we can not access the cookie directly from the codeCoookieContainercode, and codeBackgroundTransferRequestcode does not seem to support using a codeCookieContainercode, only adding the cookies directly to its headers.p  pSo my question is, how can I use codeBackgroundTransferRequestcode, if I have to send to the server the HttpOnly FedAuth cookie given by WIF I would NOT want to switch off HttpOnly, if there is any other solution.p  pI have seen that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9174709howtosetcookiecontainertobackgroundtransferrequestobjectinwpthisa specific question did not get any answers, which emmightem mean  it is not possible to directly associate a codeCookieContainercode with a codeBackgroundTransferRequestcode.p

Negative 452 pI have a small question, my guess is that its not possible, but never knowp  pIm developing plugins for Maya, and its still compiled with gcc4.1.2. But Id like to code with the new C0x. Is it possible to compile and create my shared object let call it X.so but then, through shared object call Xproxy.so that would map my function in X.so, but to used by a program with an older architecture.p  pThe structure would be  Maya  Xproxy.so  X.sop  pXproxy would just be there to forward the call to X.so. This way, it would be easy to develop with new tools and make them compatible with old ones or recent ones using old tools.p  pEDIT Another solution that I see might be to compile .cpp files in .cpp.o files with the latest version of g, but then using an older version of g to link them. Would that be possible p

Negative 452 pI have a webservice that runs on multiple different remote redhat machines. Whenever I want to update the service I will sync down the new webservice source code written in perl from a version control depotI use perforce and restart the service using that new synced down perl code. I think it is too boring to log to remote machines one by one and do that series of commands to restart the service one by one manully. So I wrote a bash script update.sh like below in order to do it one time one place, update all machines. I will run this shell script in my local machine. But it seems that it wont work. It only execute the first command sudo u webserviceusername i as I can tell from the command line in my local machine. The code below only shows how it will update one of the remote webservice. The export P4USERmyname is for usage of perforce clientp  precodebinsh     ssh mynameremotehost1 sudo u webserviceusername i  export P4USERmyname cd dir  p4 sync  cd bin  .prog domainconfigfile restart  tail f ..logsservice.log codepre  pWhy I know the only first command is executed Well because after I input the password for the ssh on my local machine, it showsbrp  precodeYour environment has been modified.

But it seems weird, it cannot cd to that dir, it says cddir No such file or directory it also says p4 command not found. So it looks like the sudo u command executes with no effect and the export command has either not executed or excuted with no effect.br A detailed local log file is like belowp  precodeYour environment has been modified.

Negative 452 pI have an array of double values where the last one will be in fact a long representing time in milliseconds. Therefore this long needs to be converted to a double to fit into the array. Later at the time of retrieval of this long value it needs to be converted back to a long type. It is critical that the long value after retrieval from the array of doubles is exactly the same value down to a one millisecond I had before putting it into the array. There will be no operations whatsoever performed on the long value while in the array. So the questions are brShould I simply cast the long value to double and upon retrieval cast it back to long Will this preserve the exact value of my long brOr should I use Double.longBitsToDoubletime method to put the long into the array and retrieve it with Double.doubleToLongBitstime. brOr maybe I should put the long value into the array using Double.longBitsToDoubletime and retrieve the encoded long by simply casting it to long type brThank you in advance for your help.p

User threads are supported above the kernel, without kernel support. These are the threads that application programmers would put   into their programs.p      pKernel threads are supported within the kernel of the OS itself. All modern OSes support kernel level threads, allowing the kernel top      ul   liperform multiple simultaneous tasks andor to service multiple kernelli   lisystem calls simultaneously.li   ul      pIn a specific implementation, the user threads must be mapped to kernel threads, using one of the following strategiesp      p4.2.1 ManyToOne Modelp      p4.2.2 OneToOne Modelp      p4.2.3 ManyToMany Modelp blockquote  pSo which of models is supported by c11 AFAIK codeccode is not supposed to be used in a specific variety of OSs.

Also, when an EF ObjectContext materializes entities, the values are assigned by the setter and I dont want to add that to the undoredo stack either.p  pstrongedit 2strong Ive kinda given up on SO for this question. Id delete it if I could. For example, I fail to grasp how the comments about my code being not true MVVM have anything to do with the issue at hand.

Negative 452 pFirst of all sorry for my bad English D Recently Im studying more deeply Design Patterns because of an exam of Software Engineering and I have to design a software system as a project for this exam.p  pThere is a problem that I cannot handle with how to decouple entity classes which represents the data of my application domain from... everything elsep  pI mean, being more concrete, that if I have a class Patient with its own private attributes and public getter and setter methods, this is an entity class, I think that so far I got it right Dp  pSo lets say that I choose to design my program using the MVC pattern architecture, the class Patient will be in the Model, is that correctp  pNow, every view that deals with that class, will have a reference to it lets say I have three views the first one to view all patients, another one to modify a patient, and the last one to register a new patient actually there will be other classes in which I should present some reports, but I think this is irrelevant now.p  pEach one of these classes will know the structure of Patient in order to show its data, e.g. they will call its getter methods and show the data in some way.p  pI think that there is no way to avoid this, since a view is semantically tied to the data model it has to show I mean that it has to know whether a data is a string, a date or an integer and it has to know also its semantics what it represents in the real world so I think that doesnt make much sense just removing references to the class Patient.p  pNow the heart of the problem is How to prevent that a change in the class Patient propagates to all classes not only views that uses itp  pI mean lets say that the attribute String Cellular changes in String[] Cellular because of a change in the requirements. I will have to modify 1 DB  DB interfaces 2 Patient class 3 worst of all every class that uses Patientp  pHow to avoid this I think that in a good project a change in a single class should not propagate in a chain of changes to all modules that uses that class, but Im a beginner and I cant think of a way to prevent this.p  pI cant even think of a good way to use a stable interface for entity classes, since a change in the requirements will reflect in a change to the interfaces and I dont think that interfaces are meant to be changed.p  pPlease helpp

Negative 452 pIve been working on this problem for a few days now and having trawled the net trying to find an answer, Ive decided to ask my first question here to see if I can get some help.p  pBasically, Im trying to authenticate to my LDAP server using DIGESTMD5 encryption. While using Simple encryption it works just fine, but I cant have the password sent over the network in plaintext, for obvious reasons. The strange thing is that while using Softerra LDAP Browser I can connect to the server using DigestMD5, but through my Code I receive a range of errors. From what I can tell my code is as it should be, but obviously that isnt the case due to the fact that it doesnt work. Here is a snippet of code from my ldap authentication class where I try to set the security authentication etc before creating the initial context.p  precodeHashtable env  new Hashtable11 env.putContext.SECURITYAUTHENTICATION, DIGESTMD5 env.putContext.SECURITYPRINCIPAL, username env.putContext.SECURITYCREDENTIALS, password env.putContext.PROVIDERURL, ldapURI env.putContext.INITIALCONTEXTFACTORY, context env.putcom.sun.jndi.ldap.trace.ber, System.out try     DirContext ctx  new InitialLdapContextenv,null  Catch NamingException e     e.printStackTrace  codepre

Negative 452 pI was asked to do some PHP scripts on MySQL DB to show some data when I noticed the strange design they had. They want to perform a study that would require collecting up to 2000 records per user and they are automatically creating a new table for each user that registers. Its a pilot study at this stage so they have around 30 tables but they should have 3000 users for the real study.p  pI wanted to suggest gathering all of them in a single table but since there might be around 1500 INSERTs per minute to that database during the study period, I wanted to ask this question here first. Will that cause table locks in MySQL So, Is it one table with 1500 INSERTs per minute and a maximum size of 6,000,000 records or 3000 tables with 30 INSERTs per minute and a maximum size of 2000 records. I would like to suggest the first option but I want to be sure that it will not cause any issues. I read that InnoDB has rowlevel locks. So, will that have a better performance combined with the one table optionp

Negative 452 pI have a SharePoint 2010 Foundation site that has recently been upgraded from WSS 3.0.  The upgrade was completed successfully with no glitches.p  pHowever, ever since I have upgraded the site I have got a problem relating to lookup fields on the NewForm.aspx New list entry page on some calendar lists that were existing on the site prior to the upgrade.  p  pThe issue is that I have two lookup fields, one for strongClientstrong and another for strongMeeting Type  Locationstrong.  When I am on the NewForm.aspx new list item entry page and I select an entry in one of the lookup fields the second doesnt allow me to select anything and just gives me the top value in the lookup list without offering any other alternative selections like it should.  These fields are just standard SharePoint Lookup fields and are not modified in any way, nor is the page.  This problem does not happen on new lists I create with more than one lookup field in them in the site nor does it happen if I add extra lookup fields on the existing lists, it just leaves these two fields with issues.p  pI have used Internet Explorers debugging tools to see if there is an error in any of the JavaScript on the page but nothing is being reported as being a problem and I have also tried rendering the page in different standards in Internet Explorer to see if it is related to the browser but these do not many any difference.  One thing that is apparent though is that the values for both lookup fields are being pulled in to the HTML of the page as I can see them when viewing the HTML source of the page when it has loaded and in the Developer Tools in Internet Explorerp  pIf anyone has any experience of things like this and could point me in the direction of a fix for this I would be very grateful...p  pMany thanks in advance...p

Negative 452 pIm using eclipse and, sometimes, adb directly.  Either way, the adb server starts but neither eclipse nor the adb command app can make a connection.  Eclipse gives error    The connection to adb is down... you must restart...  I try the connection from eclipse by attempting to debug my app from the command line I try adb logcat.p  pThis problem had been intermittent over the last week or so, ever since I updated the android sdk tools and platform tools.  I just updated again to 21.0.1 and 16, respectively.  Now the problem is 100 consistent and I cannot debug any code p  pIm running eclipse and adb on Window 7.  Im trying to connect to a Nexus 7 or a Kyocera CS170.p  pIve tried using Task Manager to kill adb.  If either device is plugged in, adb restarts automatically, but still doesnt connect.  If not plugged in, I can start it via the adb command line.  Then, after plugging in a device, it still doesnt connect. p  pAny ideap
Negative 452 pIt is possible to place any type of custom control into the shells trim area in SWT using Shell.getToolBar introduced in SWT 3.7. One needs to create a ToolItem with SWT.SEPARATOR style and assign it a custom control. My custom control is the entire tool bar area including some Composite based custom widgets.p  pSee this bug comment for what I have done roughlyp  pa hrefhttpsbugs.eclipse.orgbugsshowbug.cgiid222859c124 relnofollowhttpsbugs.eclipse.orgbugsshowbug.cgiid222859c124ap  pThe problem is that the user may drag the shell by clicking into an empty area of the unified tool bar. And it appears my custom control is regarded as empty space. One of my controls supports dragampdrop. However, when its placed in the unified tool bar area, dragging drags the shell, not the widget contents that are supposed to be draggable. Actually, both happens at the same time. So all I would need is to somehow stop the event from being processed any further. Attaching a Listener for SWT.MouseDown to my custom control and setting event.doit to false doesnt work.p

In the next time, I expected to reuse the TCP socket, But, TCP connection created newly with TCP port 40642. Is there something I miss to reuse sockets  p  pADD  I found something unexpected behavior in the tcpdump log. The web server sends html page with KeepAlive timeout5, max100 and Connection KeepAlive options in the html header.  But, the device sends FIN immediately without waiting 5 seconds. I suspect that the device may not be able to parse the keepalive or timeout options. I tested this code in Galaxy S3 with Android 4.0.4.p

Negative 452 pI am currently working on an app where I would like to transition from one screen to another when the user rotates the device to landscape view. I have this working, but the screen that is being transitioned out rotates to landscape view just as the next view is coming in. A common solution to preventing the current view from rotating is to return NO for the shouldAutoRotate method. However, I need this enabled in order to transition to the next screen. Ive also toyed with [UIView setAnimationsEnabledNO] in the willRotateToInterfaceOrientation but this only hides the animation, and still rotates the current view to landscape. Here are all related rotate methodsp  precodeBOOLshouldAutorotate          return YES   Temporarily disable rotation animation voidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration      [UIView setAnimationsEnabledNO]   voiddidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationfromInterfaceOrientation      [UIView setAnimationsEnabledYES]      ifUIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft         [self performSegueWithIdentifierlandscapeView senderself]    NSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations      return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAllButUpsideDown  codepre  pAny suggestions Thanks in advance.p
Negative 452 phere is an issue I have never seen before and thought it would be shareworthy. Im not sure why it happens though.p  pThis is how I invoke my programp  blockquote   p.foo switch1 arg1 switch2 arg2 switch3 arg3arg4arg5 switch4 arg6p blockquote  pEach switch is used to indicate a different type of argument and I parse them accordingly.p  pThe problem occurs with switch3, which indicates that codearg3code, codearg4code, codearg5code all correspond to the same switch and are delineated using the codecode character.p  pFor some reason, I can run the program perfectly, but when I try to debug it using gdb, My program crashes with a codeduring startup, program exited with code 127code error.p  pHeres what intrigues me. It also says codebinbash arg4 not foundcode. It takes the argument right after the first codecode character, which now I assume it perceives as the pipe character, and tries to invoke a bash script.p  pWhy does this happen Doesnt the compiler take the entire command line string and consider space separated tokens as different arguments Why is the codecode being interpreted differently I tried adding codearg3arg4arg5code in inverted quotes codecode, and it works fine. I also tried separating them by codecode, eg. codearg3arg4arg5code, and this works fine too.p

Negative 452 pI came up with the following problem but I am not able to find a solution for it.p  pStatementp  pThere are N wine glasses. Each wine glass is assumed to have infinite capacity. The amount of wine in each glass is a positive nonzero integer, where the unit is ml. A move of type1 is defined as transfer of one ml from glass i to glass j. A move of type2 is defined as discarding of one ml from glass i. All moves of type1 have a cost of one. All moves of type2 have a cost of k. Given the initial amount of wine in each glass, we need to make some moves of the two kinds to ensure that the amount of wine in each glass is a prime numberor zero. Print the minimum cost for such a transformation.p  pHow to tackle this problem Any ideas for a possible solutionp

I was thinking of just putting a call in the Home view to the model responsible for displaying news feed stuff. Is this bad practice or not Basically what is the best way for displaying stuff that is dynamic like a news feed or even a users photos when logged inp

Also the formula codeCONVERTDATE, 2001code works as expected  so there is something with using the column that is causing the error.p  pThe original column is a codeVARCHAR10code and contains NULL values emorem values that are otherwise convertible to codeDATEcode. The query codeSELECT CONVERTDATE,charDob as dob FROM peoplecode works as expected. Also, the error message is about invalid formula and not about a data conversion error, so I dont believe that inconvertible is causing this.p  pI have already saved the table with the new computed column and a dummy value and reconnected to the database  this was to ensure that there was not an odd caching issue occurring, as sometimes occurs. The error persists independent of the persisted flag  if only it were that easy to turn off.p

Negative 452 pI have been seeking solutions for debugging Node.js based web application from days.

Negative 452 pIm writing a simple Java Swing application that is designed as a demo for a course.  The purpose of the program is to visualize the progress of a recursive method specifically, a recursive solution to a maze.  Id like to be able to update the appearance of the JComponent as the recursive method executes, so from the perspective of Swing the updates cant be triggered individually from a Timer class, which I gather is the usual method for animations.p  pMy first thought was just to call repaint whenever I want to redraw the visualization.  But the recursive method itself is called in the event handler of a JButton, which means all the calls to repaint are delayed until the event handler terminates  and all I get to see is the last frame of the animation.  I found that I can get the drawing to happen immediately if I call update instead, like thisp  precodegetRootPane.getContentPane.updategetGraphics try      Thread.sleep25  catch Exception e   codepre  pThis almost works, except that the animation flickers.  I know that Swing is doublebuffered, but apparently getGraphics gives me the active buffer rather than the back buffer.  I cant see any methods that would give me access to the back buffer.p  pSo Im looking for a solution that would allow me to repaint the component in the middle of the recursion and give me a flickerfree animation.  Is there a way to activate the builtin doublebuffering while an event handler is executing  Would it be better to try to implement my own buffering system  Or is what Im trying to do just not possibleadvisable with Swingp  pAs a final note, this is my first post here.  Ive tried to write a good question, but if Im missing anything please let me know nicely and Ill try to do better next time.  Thanksp

Negative 452 pSo I get that String index out of range means that Im exceeding the range of a collection, but Im not quite sure how Im doing that with my code.p  pThis code is supposed to read from a text file which contains 3 ints the first two being what are relevant to this as the number of rows and number of columns respectively and then a series of characters.

Now, this works, however I find it ugly and it sort of defeats the beauty of using the EntityFramework. Also, this is a very basic example, in the future I might face similar situation where I would need to boxunbox lots of other fields, which doesnt look good.p  pSo my question is is there any way of easily converting the MaterializedDataRecord to an entity or of setting the EntityDataSource not to consider the presence of something in the Select as a threat which leads to creating MaterializedDataRecord instead of an entityp  pI mean I would understand that behavior if I was selecting a subset of the entitys fields, but here Im selecting all the fields, so this shouldnt be a problem for the EntityDataSource to convert.p  pThanksp

What would be the best practice for checking and handling faults as well as keep the channel alivep  pIn my case it will be up to the user to keep the applications open or close them and we do have those users who tend to keep them open overnight, over the weekend, etc... It seems to me this could open the possibility of a fault or loss of service and I dont have a clue how to recover.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 452 pI have an aggregate data set that spans multiple years.  The data for each respective year is stored in a separate table named Data.  The data is currently sitting in MS ACCESS tables, and I will be migrating it to SQL Server.p  pI would prefer that data for each year is kept in separate tables, to be merged and queried at runtime.  I do not want to do this at the expense of efficiency, however, as each year is approx. 1.5M records of 40ish fields.p  pI am trying to avoid having to do an excessive number of UNIONS in the query.  I would also like to avoid having to edit the query as each new year is added, leading to an everexpanding number of UNIONs.p  pIs there an easy way to do these UNIONs at runtime without an extensive SQL query and high system utility  Or, if all the data should be managed in one large table, is there a quick and easy way to append all the tables together in a single queryp

All the other functions or calls to things pertain to my project and I know those are correct, my errors are coming from my implementation of pthread and passing the data along somewhere.p

Negative 452 pIve written a little filetransfer application written in C using Qt 4.x. It logs into a server, shows the user a list of files available on the server, and lets the user upload or download files.p  pThis all works fine you can even drag a file in from the desktop or from an open folder, and when you drop the file icon into the serverfileslistview, the dropped file gets uploaded to the server.p  pNow I have a request for the opposite action as well. My users would like to be able to drag a file out of the serverfileslistview and onto the desktop, or into an open folder window, and have that file get downloaded into that location.p  pThat seems like a reasonable request, but I dont know how to implement it. Is there a way for a Qt application to find out the directory corresponding to where drop event occurred, when the icon was dropped onto the desktop or into an open folder window Ideally this would be a Qtbased platformneutral mechanism, but if that doesnt exist, then platformspecific mechanisms for MacOSX and Windows XP or higher would suffice.p

Negative 452 pI have implemented codestdbasicstreambufcode derived wrapper around codestdbasicfilebufcode which converts between encodings. Within this wrapper I use a single buffer for both input and output. The buffering technique comes from a hrefhttpwww.angelikalanger.comIOStreamsExcerptexcerpt.htm relnofollowthisa article.p  pNow, the problem I cant figure out is this. My internal buffer is filled on calls to codeunderflowcode. According to the article, when switching from input to output, the buffer should be put in a state of limbo. To do this, I need to codeungetcode the unread data in the buffer. Reading the docs and the source codes, codeungetcode and codeputbackcode are not guaranteed to succeed. This will leave me with an invalid codetellgcode pointer with the next input operation.p  pIm not asking for somebody to write this for me, but I am asking advice as to how to manage ungetting data from codestdbasicfilebufcode in a way that will not fail.p  pI think, the only sure way is to calculate the bytes that would be written to file and adjust the offset accordingly. Its not as simple as it sounds though. The codefilebufcode may have an associated codelocalecode, unknown at compile time. I tried getting the facet and passing the data through its codeoutcode member, but it doesnt work. The previously read data may have a non default codembstatetcode value, and some codecodecvtcode objects also write a BOM.p  pBasically, its almost impossible to calculate the on file length of a section of file data after it has passed through a codecodecvtcode.p  pI have tagged this question with c since cfile streams also work with buffers and also use get and put pointers. codestdbasicfilebufcode is just a wrapper around a cfile stream. Answers in c are also applicable to this problem. p  pDoes anybody have any suggestions as to how to implement unlimited unget on file streamsp

Negative 452 pI have recently been tasked with opening a subdomain of a smallscale website that allows trusted users to upload and store files as backups away from their local disks.

Negative 452 pIm building a play web app that connects to Google Drive. Going through the Google OAuth 2.0 process, when a user logs in I save the accesstoken to Cache and I save the refreshtoken along with other user data to database and cache. Google OAuth accessTokens only last for a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2WebServer relnofollow1 houra, and likewise the accessToken in my cache expires in an hour.p  pSo, following, Ive created an Authenticated function along the lines of a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.xScalaActionsComposition relnofollowAnother way to create an Authenticated actiona, except that in addition to the user, I also store the accessToken.p  pHowever, the accessToken expires after an hour, and if it has expired, then I need to do a web service GET request to google with my refreshtoken in order to retrieve another accesstoken.p  pIve managed to create a synchronous version that seems a bit ugly, but works. I was wondering if perhaps theres a way to rework it to be synchronousp  precodedef Authenticated[A]p BodyParser[A]f AuthenticatedRequest[A] gt Result     Actionp  request gt     val result1  for        userId lt request.session.getusername       user lt Cache.getAs[User]suseruserId       token lt Cache.getAs[String]accessTokenKeyuserId      yield fAuthenticatedRequestuser, token, request      import scala.concurrent.duration.     lazy val result2  for        userId lt request.session.getusername       user lt Cache.getAs[User]suseruserId       token lt persistAccessTokenAwait.resultrequestNewAccessTokenuser.refreshTokenuserId, 10.secondsuserId      yield fAuthenticatedRequestuser, token, request      result1.getOrElseresult2.getOrElseResults.Redirectroutes.Application.index     codepre  pcoderequestNewAccessTokencode makes a WS post request to Google, sending the refreshToken along with other stuff, and in return google sends back a new Access Token, heres the methodp  precodedef refreshTokenBodyrefreshToken String  Map   refreshtoken gt SeqrefreshToken,   clientid gt SeqclientId,   clientsecret gt SeqclientSecret,   granttype gt SeqtokenGrantType   def requestNewAccessTokenrefreshToken Stringimplicit userId String Future[Response]    WS.urltokenUri.withHeaderstokenHeader.postrefreshTokenBodyrefreshToken codepre  pIt seems the only other way to convert a Future[ws.Response] to a ws.Response is to use onComplete, but that is a callback function with a return type of Unit, which doesnt seem to sit well with the example provided in the Playframework docs above, and I dont see how I can convert the AsyncResult back to a response without redirecting it to a second router. Another possibility that Ive thought of is a filter that intercepts requests, and if the accessToken in Cache has expired, to just get another one from Google and save it to the Cache before the Action method starts that way, the accessToken will always be current.p  pAs I said, the synchronous version works, and if thats the only way to implement this procedure, then so be it, but I was hoping there might be a way to do this asynchronously.p  pthank you so muchp  h2UPDATE FOR Play 2.2.0h2  pcodeasync code is deprecated for Play 2.2.0 and will be removed in Play 2.3. So the solution listed above will needs to be revised if you are using the current version of Play.p  pAs a reminder, of the logic, when a user successfully logs in, an Google accesstoken is persisted to the Cache. The accesstoken only lasts for an hour, so we remove the accesstoken from the Cache after an hour.p  pSo, the logic of codeAuthenticatedcode is that it checks to see there is a userId cookie in the request. Then it uses that userId to fetch the matching codeUsercode from the cache. The codeUsercode contains a coderefreshtokencode in case the current codeaccesstokencode has expired. If there is no codeuserIdcode cookie in the cache or we cannot retrieve the matching codeusercode from Cache, then we start a new session and redirect to the application landing page.p  pIf the user is successfully retrieved from cache, then we try to get the codeaccesstokencode from the Cache. If it is there, then we create a codeWrappedRequestcode object that contains the coderequestcode, codeusercode, and codeaccesstokencode. If it isnt in the Cache, then we make a web service call to Google obtain a new codeaccesstokencode, which is persisted to cache and then passed to the codeWrappedRequestcodep  pTo make an asynchronous request using codeAuthenticatedcode, we simply add code.applycode the same as for an codeActioncode, like sop  precodedef testing123  Authenticated.async    Future.successful  Oktesting 123   codepre  pAnd here is the updated trait, which works for Play 2.2.0p  precodeimport controllers.routes import models.User  import play.api.cache.Cache import play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.Implicits.defaultContext import play.api.mvc. import play.api.Play.current import scala.concurrent.Future  trait Authenticate extends GoogleOAuth      case class AuthenticatedRequest[A]user User, accessToken String, request Request[A]     extends WrappedRequest[A]request    val startOver Future[SimpleResult]  Future      Results.Redirectroutes.Application.index.withNewSession       object Authenticated extends ActionBuilder[AuthenticatedRequest]      def invokeBlock[A]request Request[A],                    block AuthenticatedRequest[A] gt Future[SimpleResult]         request.session.getuserName.map  implicit userId gt         Cache.getAs[User]userKey.map  user gt           Cache.getAs[String]accessTokenKey.map  accessToken gt             blockAuthenticatedRequestuser, accessToken, request           .getOrElse   users accessToken has expired, so do WS call to Google for another one             requestNewAccessTokenuser.token.flatMap  response gt               persistAccessTokenresponse.map  accessToken gt                 blockAuthenticatedRequestuser, accessToken, request               .getOrElsestartOver                                 .getOrElsestartOver  user not found in Cache       .getOrElsestartOver  userName not found in session          codepre

Negative 452 h2Situationh2  pIm having trouble coming up with a good way to do a certain MongoDb query. First, heres what kind of query I want to do. Assume a simple database which logs entry and exit events and possibly other actions, doesnt matter by electronic card swipe. So theres a collection called codeswipelogcode with simple documents which look like thisp  precode     id ObjectId524ab4790a4c0e402200052c     name John Doe,      action entry,     timestamp ISODate20131001T13212.112Z   codepre  pNow I want to list names and their last entry times and any other fields I may want, but example below uses just these two fields.p  h2Current solutionh2  pHere is what I have now, as a oneliner for MongoDb JavaScript consolep  precodedb.swipelog.distinctname            .forEach functionname       db.swipelog.find  name name, actionentry                  .sort  natural1                  .limit1                .forEach functionentry           printjson [ entry.name, entry.timestamp ]         codepre  pWhich prints something likep  precode[ John Doe, ISODate20131001T13212.112Z] [ Jane Deo, ISODate20131001T13612.112Z] ... codepre  h2Questionh2  pI think above has the obvious scaling problem. If there are a hundred names, then 1100 queries will be made to the database. So what is a goodcorrect way to get last codetimestampcode of every distinct codenamecode  Changing database structure or adding some collections is ok, if it makes this easier.p

Negative 452 pSummary  I have a web control that is dynamically added to the page.  The control has a HiddenField child control.  I am passing the controls ClientID to a jquery widget that is setting the value to a string json converted to string.  When the form is posted back to the server, the value of the HiddenField is a blank string.  I value is in the Request.Form[emUniqueIDem] object.  The value is making it back to the server.  The problem is that, I dont have access to the Request object when I need the value without modifying a lot of legacy code.p  pThe strange thing is that the selectmany control is the one I am having a problem with, but it inherits from the SelectOne that is working properly.

Negative 452 pso I have a gsp with a form, and I am trying to use twitter validation states when validating the form fields. I am using a grails command object for validation. The problem is that grails provides a way to add the error class onto a control group if a field from the command object has errors using  hasErrorsbeanvalidationCommand, fieldstart, error . This adds the error tag if the field start has validation errors. This works fine, up to a point. So the start field turns red on validation error. But I want it to turn green on a validation success also which is not happening. p  pSo, here is the start form field  p  precode ltdiv  classcontrolgroup hasErrorsbeanvalidationCommand, fieldstart, errorgt                     ltlabel classcontrollabel forstartgtStarting Tagltlabelgt                     ltdiv classcontrolsgt                         ltgtextField namestart                             valuefieldValuebeanvalidationCommand,fieldstart                             classinputmedium  gt                         ltghasErrors beanvalidationCommand fieldstartgt                             ltulgt                                 ltspan classhelpinlinegt ltgrenderErrors                                         beanvalidationCommand fieldstart aslist gt                                 ltspangt                             ltulgt                         ltghasErrorsgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt codepre  pOne way I could think of setting this up is by using a test to see if the field has errors and setting a variable say startState to success or error and then using startState class in the div. p  precodeltgif test hasErrorsbeanvalidationCommand, fieldstart gt                     ltgset varstartState valueerrorgt                 ltgifgt                 ltgelsegt                     ltgset varstartState valuesuccessgt                 ltgelsegt                 ltgifgt                 ltdiv                     classcontrolgroup startStategt                     ltsame gsp as abovegt codepre  pWhat this does is that it the field is green from the beginning even when nothing is entered in the text field and then turns red on error, or stays green. p  pMy last attempt to make this work involved another if test to see whether the field is set using p  precodeltgif testfieldValuebeanvalidationCommand,fieldstart  null gt codepre  pThis doesnt affect the outcome from the second attempt. p  pSo the question is , how can i dynamically add the success class to a div tag based on the validation of the input field.p  pEDIT  p  pThe controller is shown below  p  precodeclass ValidationController   def index    def validateValidationCommand cmd      if cmd.hasErrors          render view index, model [validationCommand cmd]      else          try              SourceLocation repo  SourceLocation.findByIdcmd.repo             def parentJira  cmd.issueService.findIssuecmd.jira              CollectionltIssueViewModelgt issues  cmd.issueService.listIssuesForParentcmd.jira             CollectionltSourceCommitViewModelgt commits  cmd.sourceRepositoryService.listCommitsrepo.project, repo.slug, cmd.start, cmd.end              def valid, missinglinkedissues, missingmentionedissues, badcommits, issueswithfilteredcommits  cmd.validationService.validaterepo, issues, commits             [ParentJira parentJira, Valid valid, Commits commits, Issues issues, LinkedMissing missinglinkedissues, MentionedMissing missingmentionedissues, BadCommits badcommits, SourceCommitValidation issueswithfilteredcommits]          catch e              log.error Validation Controller Error, e              flash.message  validation.service.failed             flash.args  [e.message]             flash.default  Validation Service failed             redirect action index, params params                 codepre  pThe command object is  p  precodeclass ValidationCommand   def validationService def sourceRepositoryService def issueService  String jira String repo String start String end  static constraints       jira blank false, nullable false, matches [azAZ][09], validator existsIssueAndIsARelease     repo blank false, nullable false, validator  val, obj gt SourceLocation.findByIdval  null      start blank false, nullable false, validator existsTag     end blank false, nullable false, validator existsTag   codepre

I cant find any example in which codestdcopycode is used on pointers like codedouble  bins  new double[nbinsi]code. So, my question is is legal to use codestdcopycode on pointers, like for examplep  precodedouble  bins  new double[nbins1] is this necessary stdcopy stdbegin source.bins , stdendsource.bins, stdbeginbins  codepre  por should I rather rely on the C codememcpycodep  precodedouble  bins  new double[nbins1] again, is this necessary memcpy source.bins, bins, nbins1  sizeofdouble   codepre  pSo, my questions are basically twop  p1 Does codestdendbinscode know where is the end of codebins new double[nbins1]codep  p2 Do I need to allocate the memory for the destination before doing the copy Or the codecopycode or codememcpycode takes care of thatp

The one that I have seen commonly being used is by using a command of the formp  precoderesponse.writeJSON.stringifyanObject codepre  pHowever, this has two points where one could argue as if they were problemsp  ul liWe are sending a string.li liMoreover, there is no new line character in the end.li ul  pAnother idea is to use the commandp  precoderesponse.sendanObject codepre  pThis appears to be sending a JSON object based on the output of curl similar to the first example above. However, there is no new line character in the end of the body when curl is again being used on a terminal. So, how can one actually write down something like this with a new line character appended in the end using node or nodeexpressp

Negative 452 pWhat are the best practices to structure big android databases From what Ive seen so far doing some research on this topic, Ive seen that most people are using a DatabaseHelper, which extends SQLiteOpenHelper. Does this also apply when you have multiple tables p  pFor example, in my current project, I have about 30 tables. So far, all of my tables are being created in my DatabaseHelper class, which currently is getting pretty huge. For every module, I also have a classSource class, which has all the CRUD methods in that module, and is using a singleton instance of my DatabaseHelper class. p  pSomehow it feels unnatural to have all of that code in my DatabaseHelper class.

To determine if a set of polygons completely enclose a 3D volume, I test each face to ensure that each edge is shared by another face where an edge is defined by two adjacent points.p  pThus, Face contains a vector of pointers to Points...p  precodestdvectorltPointgt points codepre  pand to check if a Face is surrounded, Face contains a member function...p  precodebool isSurroundedstdvectorltFacegt  neighbours      int count  0     forautoampamp i  neighbours      for each potential face         if i  this               that is not this face             for int j  0 j lt nPoints j  and for each point in this face                 for int k  0 k lt igtnPoints k   check if the neighbour has a shared point, and that the next point backwards or forwards is also shared                     if   thisgtatj  igtatk          Points are the same, check the next and previous point too to make a pair                        ampamp      thisgtatj1nPoints  igtatk1igtnPoints                                thisgtatj1nPoints  igtatkigtnPoints1igtnPoints                           count      if count gt nPoints  1  number of egdes  nPoints 1         return true     else         return false  codepre  pNow, obviously this code is horrible.

Negative 452 pI have written a Java application that includes a self updater. The self updater loads new program versions from a web server and replaces the application files. While this works perfectly if the application is installed e.g. in the users home directory, it fails on windows machines if its installed in the CProgram Files folder. This is because the JVM is executed under the users account which has no write access to the program directory. If a native program, e.g. an installer, tries to write to the program folder, usually a popup appears asking the user to permit the write operation. This doesnt happen for java applications. Whyp  pIs there any way to achieve that a write operation of a Java program to a restricted folder brings up the security popup so that the user can permit access to that folderp  hr  pThanks for your responses. According to the answers I see the following optionsp  ol lipJava Web Startbr For me this is not an option for end users. I think that no one can expect from an ordinary end user to know what Java Web Start is, what its good for and how its used e.g. I doubt that an ordinary Windows user knows how to uninstall a Java Web Start application. pli lipUse an exelauncher with manifest to launch the Java applicationbr As far as I understand this solution the exelauncher would request extended execution right at application start. This is not exactly what I want, cause for my use case it would be sufficient to get extended rights if an update is available and not on every application start.pli lipPerform the update operation by calling a native executablebr One could call a native executable to let it perform the update operation. In this way the application would only request extended rights if an update is available. This sounds not bad but includes some native coding for Windows and doesnt work on other platforms.  pli lipInstall a launcher in program folder and the application in user homebr One can place a launcher in the program folder that calls the application that is installed in the users home directory. In this way it would be possible to update the application in the users home folder. I use InnoSetup for installing my application on Windows and as far as I can see it a split installation is hard to achieve with this installer and probably with other too.pli lipInstall the complete application in the users home directorybr Because the user has write access to his home directory there is no problem at all. For me this looks like the best option cause of its simplicity. pli ol

Negative 452 pI recently finished building my own version of a lightbox using HTML5, CSS, and jQuery. At the core of it, jQuery basiically just adds the entire lightbox to the current displayed page. I say this to make it clear that Im not using any sort of fancy devices such as prototypes or iFrames. I was also able to add comments to the lightbox and thats where the problem comes in.p  pI want the comments to be separate for every image. Meaning, users should be able to commenton each individual image, not the whole gallery itself. The problem Im having is that the facebook comments only record commnets for the whole page. So, while in the lightbox, the comments dont refresh when I go to the next image. p  pIve tried passing the individual picture URl to the datahref attribute that facebook requests but that didnt work. I really dont know what to do...p  pFrom my understanding, and much searching thru google, the comments need to be linked to an individual page URL. I can see where the problem comes in it asks for html page urls but Im passing them picture urls. p  p1 Should i use an iframe and load the picture in there, then pass iframe url to the datahref attribute 2 Should i try using prototypes i dont even know what those are or if they would even apply to my case lolp  pBasically how do I tell facebook to save comments linked to an individual picture and not the entire html pagep  pP.S. This is like, my third time posting the same similar question so I decided not to put the code up again... I did before, no one answered and this time I felt there was no need to waste the space. Everything about the code works tho except for the comments for every image. If someone wants to see the code, however, just ask and Ill put it up.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongemSOLUTION UPDATEemstrong I managed to get this to work. It turns out facebook thought ahead and made it so their comments can be linked directly to an image and not just a .html file. For any struggling adventurers out there like me here is what you have to do 1 Set datahref originally equal to the absolute URL of the image that the user clicks on 2 When the user clicks previousnext, update the datahref of the comments to reflect the change in picture and call the following method right afterp  precodeFB.XFBML.parse codepre  pThat method basically refreshes the comments plugin and makes it display the updated comments. That was my problem. In theory, my code was working the whole time, I just wasnt reparsing it. I added that line and it works like a charm.p  pFor anyone interested, you can check out the rough framework of the lightbox here a hrefhttpshakazulu.hosted.melightboxlightboxPractice.html relnofollowhttpshakazulu.hosted.melightboxlightboxPractice.htmlap  pDont judge, its just a practice domain I use to try things out. I will try to keep that code up there as long as I can as I noticed its very hard to find something similar on Google. If anyone needs the whole jQuery code or the CSS, simply ask and I will post it here.p  pGood luck in your programming adventuresp  pstrongememememememememstrongp

Negative 452 pIve recently started working with Entity Framework version 4.1 and WCF. Im trying to make an ntier asp.net application .Net Framework 4.0, in which the datalayer consists of wcf services that internally use the entityframework. The approach taken with the entity framework is modelfirst. p  pOn my development environment i have both the asp.net application and the wcf services running on the IIS 7.5 under the same web site and under the same application pool Its not great but it works. On the first access of any of the wcf services, the performance is quite poor, but on subsequent accesses its OK. The reasons for the bad performance on the first access, are explained a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc85332728vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowherea  e.g. the overhead associated with the view generation, preparation of the queries, etc,p  pAfter completing the development, Ive set up a testing environment with 2 virtual machines  one server IIS 7.5 that hosts the application frontend and another one again IIS 7.5 that hosts wcf services  running in different machines, under different websites and different application pools.p  pI was expecting the same behavior, namely a slow first access to the services and subsequent accesses executing a lot faster, but all accesses to the services run slow.p  pThe problem is not with the queries being heavy and its not a problem with the network . I have executed an entity framework profiling tool, and apparently the overhead of generating the views and the preparation of queries exists on every call to the wcf service. The execution of the queries runs fast.p  pEssentially Im trying to figure out why I am noticing different behaviors on different environments.p  pFrom what Ive read, every time an AppDomain is created, the entityframework executes the operations that are associated with the initial overhead. But does this mean for every call to a WCF service a new AppDomain is createdp  pI appreciate any insight anyone can provide me on this onep  pThanksp

Negative 452 pI am writing a server program in Mac OSX using XCode 5.0 in a Late 2011 MBP, OS is a 10.8.5. I am using cocoaasyncsockets a hrefhttpsgithub.comrobbiehansonCocoaAsyncSocket relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrobbiehansonCocoaAsyncSocketa. I tried the echoserver example that comes in the cocoaasyncsocket download.p  pI tried a load testing at it, and at about 2550 connections estabilished, it stopped acceptingestabilishing connections. I tried to increase that number, and I will be honest, I may have messed my configuration mostly using sysctl w calls, so when I booted it was back to its default, but as far as I got, the 2550 connections limit remained.  When I rebooted and kept trying the next day, I noticed the new limit at which the same happened was of only 250 connections, and I could not get past that.p  pI also tried that on a mac mini 2011 I never changed anything in any configuration of this mini, it is as vanilla as it gets, and the connection limit is 250 connections also.p  pI suppose the OS is limiting the maximum connections, and this is my question how do I increase the maximum allowed number of connections OSX allows p  pI intended to get at least 32k tcp connections, and now I dont even know if it is possible.

Negative 452 pRecently I was looking to use the custom font codeSSStandardcode in a iOS application.

I like how you only have a minimal set of functions and datatypes the C standard library and still you can create almost everything with it.p  pBut now to my question How do you make simple eventhandling in C I have read about the signals.h header and this would be what i am looking for... if there were signals exclusivly reserved for the user. But i can never be sure that the environment unexpectedly raises one of the signals that i can use with the C standard library. Okay... there is the extended signals header in linuxunix with 2 signals for the user... but i can imagine situations where you need more...  Besides i want to learn writing C platform independent. I heard about emulating signals by listening to a socket... but that would also not be platform independent.p  pIs there any way to write a C program that has to handle events without getting platform dependent only by help of the standard C libraryp  pThank you for any hintsp

Negative 452 pThis is bugging me in a formerly passing Rspec test in my Rails 4 app. Earlier I had tested an Rspec feature to create an Item through a form and a boolean, allornothing. It passed. So the requirements changed that I needed to flag if an Item needed a Date and Time parameter. Using TDD, I let the test prompt me when to add this feature to the app. And thats when I got the error in the  subject line. Ahh, I must make a migration to add these two fields to Item. Done. But I still get this error.p  pHmm. The form element for allornothing works fine. I modeled it exactly, I thought and believe I carefully examined to find any typing goofs in the two new fields in simpleformfor. Ive even rewritten it in formfor and it still yields the same error. If I yank out either date or time, it cant find that column in Item. Yanking both, the test passes fine, but the spec is a failure.p  pAs a reality check, I can do this through the web page and find no error and the form works as expected. So Rspec is not seeing the date or time field in Item. Ive tried to help Rspec find it within css but that didnt work as well.  Ive rerun the migration but the smoke test through the browser wouldnt work if I hadnt already run the migration. Googling for this message didnt point me to the clue I needed.

Negative 452 pI want to create a javascript object from a template. The problem is I dont know what the template is going to look like beforehand. As a simple example, if I had the template functionp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodetemplate  function data      return          title data.title       codepre  pthen I could run codetemplate title Steve code and get back the objectp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode title Steve  codepre  pBecause codedata.titlecode is not evaluated until I call the template function. But Im constructing an object based on user input where the field names are not known beforehand and could be deeply nested anywhere in the object. p  pIf I define the object that is returned beforehand then the codedata.titlecode field in the example would already be evaluated and wouldnt use the input data. For example, I want to be able to define the template object likep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodeobj   title this.title  codepre  pthen redefine the template asp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodetemplate  function       return obj  codepre  pand call codetemplate.calltitleStevecode. But currently I get backp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode title undefined  codepre  pbecause codethis.titlecode was already evaluated when I defined codeobjcode. Maybe Im approaching this the wrong way, because I keep coming to the conclusion that Id have to modify the function by stringifying it, modifying the string to include the unevaluated code codethis.titlecode and creating a new function from the string. But that seems like a plain awful idea.p  pAnd traversing the object looking for special values to replace seems expensive and complicated. I also looked for some sort of javascript object templating library but didnt find anything.p  pstrongEDITstrong To make it more clear that the input data and the template structure wont necessarily match, I may want have a template that looks likep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodetemplate  function data      return          name Alfred,         stats              age 32,             position                  level 10,                 title data.title                             codepre  pand call codetemplatetitleManagercode to getp  p     name Alfred,     stats          age 32,         position              level 10,             title Manager               p

Negative 452 pI have an app which uses an instance of the codeSocketcode class to communicate with a server. I use the streams returned by codesocket.getInputStreamcode and codesocket.getOutputStreamcode to read and write data. p  pWhen my Android app is always active not minimized, there is no problem with the communication. It does not matter how long the connection lasts. p  pWhen I pause the application and reopen it quickly, everything still works fine. However, when I pause the application for about 5 minutes and reopen it, the codeInputStreamcode shows strange behavior it stops reading anything. I get timeout errors instead of the data sent by the server. p  pThe connection is still alive, the server is able to write and read. codeisInputShutdowncode on the clientside returns false. p  pUsing a network analysis tool, I can also see that the data sent by the server IN FACT reaches the client but it somehow does not get recognized by the codeInputStreamcode ... p  pHowever, writing data from the client to the server using the codeOutputStreamcode works fine.p  pMaybe its worth mentioning that the socket object and the streams are declared as codestaticcode to be accessible for all the activities of the app. But as I dont have any problems with the codeOutputStreamcode, I cannot imagine that this could be the reason.p  pThe only workaround I have at this point is to close the whole socket and connect a new one to the server. But this is causing unnecessary network traffic because I have to handshake again. It would be better not to do it this way.p  pIf anyone has had similar experience and found a solution, I would be really happy if you could share it with me.p

I understand in Swift all the properties must be initialized before we can use them and self is called implicitly and hence the error. But apparently that means I cant call computed properties in the init method, so I want to know if there is any better way of implementing what I am trying to do or not I understand that I can create stored properties for every computed property and treat it as an iVar but it doesnt seem like an elegant solution either. p  pI would really appreciate your help regarding this guys.p

Negative 452 pIm new to autofac and looking to see the best practices on passing runtime values to constructor.  Ive read a bunch of stackoverflow questions where this is asked but none are fully fleshed out.  Should we be using delegates, factory to create service etc.  I know passing the container around is not the best way to accomplish this.p  pIn my particular case I have a service that access multiple dependencies, say logging, dataprovider, etc.  Along with the few services being passed I also have runtime parameters I need to capture, say userid, password.  The userid and password are required for the SomeService and are looked up when a web viewer performs a particular action. Below is what I have and highlighted is the issue.p  precodepublic class SomeService  ISomeService      private readonly IDataProvider dataProvider     private readonly ILog log     private readonly string username       private readonly string password      public SomeServiceIDataProvider dataProvider, ILog log,         string username, string password            dataProvider  dataProvider       log  log       username  username       password  password       codepre  pThe dataprovider, and log are configured in autofacp  precodebuilder.RegisterTypeltDataProviderServicegt.AsltIDataProvidergt builder.RegisterTypeltSomeLogServicegt.AsltILoggt codepre  pMost of the functionality of this SomeService requires a username and password to verify before performing tasks, so figured it best to pass into constructor when creating but have never dealt with runtime requirements for autofac.  Ive reviewed the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22259722autofacresolvingruntimeparameterswithouthavingtopasscontaineraroundAutofac  resolving runtime parameters without having to pass container arounda and it seems close to what I need but need some more feedback on the best way to accomplish this.p

Negative 452 pHave seen Dominick Baiers videos on Pluralsight and most of this I got from there. Im trying to do a claims transformation in .net 4.5, MVC. After a lot of messing around I can get the claims transformed, but cant get them to persist. If I just have it run my ClaimsTransformer every time no problem, but this is hitting a database so I want to cache these.p  pSo heres what I didp  precode  class ClaimsTransformer  ClaimsAuthenticationManager        public override ClaimsPrincipal Authenticatestring resourceName, ClaimsPrincipal incomingPrincipal            if incomingPrincipal.Identity.IsAuthenticated                return base.AuthenticateresourceName, incomingPrincipal               ClaimsPrincipal transformedPrincipal  incomingPrincipal codepre  pI then perform some database access add new claims to transformedPrincipal. Then create a new principal probably dont need this additional instantiation but others seemed to do it, write this outp  precode ClaimsPrincipal newClaimsPrincipal  new ClaimsPrincipalnew ClaimsIdentitytransformedPrincipal.Claims, ApplicationCookie    if HttpContext.Current  null         this caches the transformed claims     var sessionToken  new SessionSecurityTokennewClaimsPrincipal, TimeSpan.FromHours8     FederatedAuthentication.SessionAuthenticationModule.WriteSessionTokenToCookiesessionToken      return newClaimsPrincipal codepre  pI can see the new claims here in newClaimsPrincipal. To force the transformation to get called I am using ClaimsTransformationHttpModule from the ThinkTecture guys and can verify that this code gets runp  precode    context.User  transformedPrincipal     HttpContext.Current.User  transformedPrincipal     Thread.CurrentPrincipal  transformedPrincipal codepre  pAnd my additional claims are part of the transformedPrincipal.p  pSo looks fine  but when subsequent requests come in I dont have the additional claims. ClaimsTransformer is not called, as expected, but I only have the initial set of claims  not those added by my transformation.p  pAfter logging out, my additional claims are persisted. This is using the new Visual Studio 2013 basic MVC template with Identity 2.0etc.p  pWhat I think is happening is the login runs firstp  precode    var result  await SignInManager.PasswordSignInAsyncmodel.Email, model.Password, model.RememberMe, shouldLockout false codepre  pand this writes the authentication cookie, before my claims are transformed. Following this my claimstransformer runs and writes its own authorization cookie so now I have two. When I logout the first ones claims are lost and not the second ones claims become active. p  pAm confused.com.p  pThanks Rayp

Negative 452 pI would like to reload the following vlc object when the button is pressed using jquery. I have managed to start and stop the stream using the button.

MessageBodyStream ultimately relies on WebResponseInputStream to actually read data, through this graph of relationshipsp  ul liMessageBodyStream has a member, message, that references an InternalByteStreamMessage instanceli liInternalByteStreamMessage has a member, bodyWriter, that references a StreamBasedStreamedBodyWriter instanceli liStreamBasedStreamedBodyWriter has a member, stream, that references a MaxMessageSizeStream instanceli liMaxMessageSizeStream has a member, stream, that references a WebResponseInputStream instanceli ul  pWhen you call Read on the stream, WebResponseInputStream.Read is ultimately called you can test this yourself by setting the breakpoint in Visual Studio  one caveat Just My Code option in Visual Studio  Debugging must be disabled, in order for the breakpoint to be hit. The relevant part of WebResponseInputStream.Read is the followingp  precode                    return BaseStream.Readbuffer, offset, Math.Mincount, maxSocketRead codepre  pwhere maxSocketRead is defined to be 64KB. The comment above maxSocketRead says in order to avoid blowing kernel buffers, we throttle our reads. http.sys deals with this fine, but System.Net doesnt do any such throttling.. This means that if you specify too large a read value, you exceed the kernels own buffer size and causes poorer performance as it needs to do more work.p  pDoes this cause a performance bottleneck No, it should not. Reading too few bytes at a time say, 256 bytes will cause a performance degradation. But 64KB should be a value that causes good performance. In these cases, the real bottleneck is typically the network bandwidth, not how fast data is read by the client. In order to maximize performance, it is important that the reading loop is as tight as possible in other words, there are no significant delays between reads. Lets also keep in mind that objects larger than 80KB go to the Large Object Heap in .Net, which has a less efficient memory management than the normal heap compaction does not take place under normal conditions, so memory fragmentation can occur.p

Negative 452 pIm developping a tool for radiotherapy inverse planning based in a pencilbeam approach. An important step in these methods particularly in dose calculation is a raytracing from many sources and one of the most used algorithms is Siddons one here there is a nice short description a hrefhttpondemand.gputechconf.comgtc2014posterpdfP4218CTreconstructioniterativealgebraic.pdf relnofollowhttpondemand.gputechconf.comgtc2014posterpdfP4218CTreconstructioniterativealgebraic.pdfa. Now, I will try to simplify my question p  pThe input data is a CT image a 3D matrix with values and some source positions around the image. You can imagine a cube and many points around, all at same distance but different orientation angles, where the radiation rays come from. Each ray will go through the volume and a value is assigned to each voxel according to the distance from the source. The advantage of Siddons algorithm is that the length is calculated ontime during the iterative process of the raytracing. However, I know that Bresenhams algorithm is an efficient way to evaluate the path from one point to another in a matrix. Thus, the length from the source to a specific voxel could be easily calculated as the euclidean distance two points, even during Bresenhams iterative process.p  pSo then, knowing that both are methods quite old already and efficient, there is a definitive advantage of using Siddon instead of Bresenham Maybe Im missing an important detail here but it is weird to me that in these dose calculation procedures Bresenham is not really an option and always Siddon appears as the gold standard.p  pThanks for any comment or replyp  pGood day.p

Negative 452 pI am using cakes callback method, beforeFind which adds some conditions to each query dynamically. All went well at first and thought it will minimize development time.. until I made an ajax request which performs a find on some models.. It doesnt seem to work when this happens..  Basically I am adding some query conditions p  precodepublic function beforeFindquery          ifemptythisgtaff             throw new ExceptionUsername cannot be null.                   set active flag         query[conditions][MsGa.activeflag]  active           ifemptyquery[conditions][OR]             query[conditions][OR]  array                   query[conditions][OR][]  arrayFINDINSET.thisgtaff., MsGa.aff         query[conditions][OR][]  arrayMsGa.aff gt            ifemptythisgttype             query[conditions][MsGa.type]  thisgttype                   return query  codepre  pWould it normally work in an ajax request, when a find is done on a model ofcourse..  If not how so  Is it possible to explicitly invoke it p  pstrong[EDIT]strongp  pHeres the function that is called when the ajax request is initiated  p  precode public function getResultsCountdata             return thisgtfindcount, array                 conditions gt thisgtsetupConditionsdata                       codepre  pAnd p  pcodesetupConditionscode returns an array of query conditions... p  pThe function which returns the result set p  precodepublic function getResultsdata             return thisgtfindall, array                 conditions gt thisgtsetupConditionsdata                       codepre  pWhenever I initiate the ajax request and the query is executed, a certain count is returned. And when the actual result set is returned, there are less records then actually displayed by the count function. . So my thinking was that it might be that the beforeFind is not being executed, since if I comment out this callback, the count and the number of records on the result set  are equal. I am a bit baffled p
Negative 452 pI am really new to WPF and c, and have some questions about how the applications are initialized.  I am going through some tutorials on LINQ classes in the hopes that I can bind all of my SQL Server data with observableCollections.p  pOne of the examples I found has a start like so in the App.xaml.cs filep  precodepublic partial class App  Application      protected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e              base.OnStartupe          MainWindow app  new MainWindow         ProductViewModel context  new ProductViewModel         app.DataContext  context         app.Show       codepre  pWhen I run the application I get 2 main windows.  The commands above execute and open the first one, but then a second one gets called from some system code which I cant see I can see in dissasembler, but that does not really help.  So it seems that the application that VS set up for me has a standard entry, but the sample code from Rachel Lim does not do this.  I have searched for differences in various files like App.g.i.cs which has the void Main call and both my application and the sample are the same.  I am trying to take control of the application to handle creating my observablecollections with the LINQ classes.  Is anyone familiar enough with VS and C to give me some hints on what might be happeningp

Negative 452 pI have table codeClientscode that contains many columns, however Im targeting two particular columns codeClientIdcode and codePINcode. The example that Im going to provide is not making much sense but Im just learning more advanced SQL codeTSQLcode topics and my final goal is something a lot different than what is here.p  pSo I made a function which I would like to return all rows that match certain search criteria. So I have thisp  precodeCREATE FUNCTION ufnNumberOfClients ClientId INT   RETURNS retContactInformation TABLE          Columns returned by the function     ClId int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,     PIN nvarchar50 NULL      AS   BEGIN     DECLARE      ClId INT,      PIN nvarchar50       SELECT ClId  ClientId, PIN  PIN     FROM Client     WHERE PIN LIKE 7788      IF ClientId IS NOT NULL      BEGIN         INSERT retContactInformation         SELECT ClId, PIN     END RETURN END codepre  pBut when I execute the functionp  precodeSELECT  FROM ufnNumberOfClients4 codepre  pI get only one result. Even though its a valid result, if I execute just p  precodeSELECT  FROM Client WHERE PIN LIKE 7788 codepre  pI get 5 results, and the function is returning just the last one.p  pTwo thing which worth mentioning. The example which I use to write the function the codeClId int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,code from the table is not codeDECLAREcodeed after that, but I got error if I dont do it. Also, I pass variable, but I think its not used so it shouldnt affect the behaviour or at least I think so.p  pSo how can I return all the results matching the search crieria with a functionp

Negative 452 pIm creating a system where agents written in different languages need to communicate over a local area network using the open sound control OSC protocol. One controller agent will need to broadcast information to a number of client agents.

Negative 452 pI ran into an issue where regardless of the preload attribute setting, when IE9 makes a request for a video, and the video is served by xsendfile, the request is listed as pending and keeps the connection open.p  pConsequently, if you have 10 videos trying to load, IE9 will quickly eat up all of its available connections and the browser will not be able to make further requests.p  pWhen telling IE9 to request the same video from Apache, without XSendfile, Apache serves a small portion of the file as a 200 request. Then the browser makes a request later when the play button is pressed to serve a range of the file.p  pIt looks like XSendfile is causing Apache to serve the entire file initially, instead of serving just a part of it.p  pHow can I make XSendfile requests via Apache function the same as a regular request to Apachep

Negative 452 pI need to create an msi package which installs both 32bit and 64bit .dll files of a firebreath  based plugin on a machine.

For instance, if I have a 64bit machine with Windows, Chrome 64bit and Firefox 32bit I want to be able to use my plugin from both browsers. To do so, I am using Visual Studio 2008 and Wix.  Up to now I was able to create a 32bit .dll which is converted in a 32bit .msi and a 64bit .dll which fails to be converted to a 64bit .msi, due to a heat.exe bug. I get something similar to this a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsgfirebreathdevHmGYEgZamUQ35WJWfB4zegJ relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforummsgfirebreathdevHmGYEgZamUQ35WJWfB4zegJa The implementation mentioned before would create 2 different .msi installers if the 64bit msi didnt fail.

Is this possible and if so what would be the best way to do itp

Negative 452 pI am working on a sample project in Java, specifically Android, with OpenGL ES 2.0. I am looking to create a terrain for a player to move across.

The terrain is being imported as an obj file. p  pThe import and the drawing is working fine but i am having issues making the coordinates follow the heightmap. It doesnt seem to follow it 100. The player moves up or down too soon every so often or  he drops below the terrain.p  pWhat I Have So Farp  p1What I am doing is importing the OBJ file into project. Reading the farthest point from terrain object and using this as the object length  this value  2 . This tells me how many vertices are in the object along one side.p  p2I then get the difference in the players position to terrain origin in world coordinates. I take the x and z values and divide each by the OBJ object length2 to give the region of the terrain the object is in. This will give me the percentage of where the x and z position the player is in reference to the terrain.p  p3 I open the heightmap and multiply the percentages above to the image of the heightmap to get the x and y position on the heightmap to read the height from.p  pBelow is what I am working with.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuQYP9.png altWhat I have so far...

The problem is that the content resolver then calls codenotifyChangecode which also causes codeonLoadFinishedcode to be called  which then calls the aforementioned codeviewPager.setCurrentItem0, falsecode... This means that every time a product image is downloaded, the user is sent back to the first page.p  pWhat would be a good way to handle this problemp  pOne way I was thinking was to detect whether codeonLoadFinishedcode was called due to a new query being submitted by the user or by the data being updated  but how could I do thatp

Negative 452 pIn my app, I want to delete a model from a collection and call this.model.destroy in my view. However I get a 405 response when triggering the function and the url of the response does not contain the models id. From what Ive understood from the documentation, Backbone creates the url based on the Collection url  model id. Ive fixed the problem by passing in the url to the destroy method, but know that this is not the best way.  Somehow I feel that this should work without my hack. The backend requires a Id when a DELETE request is sent.

Negative 452 pMy web programmer is having a hard time accomplishing a request.  My guess is Im not framing the question correctly since Im not a programmer.

I received an email with the following.  I think it has to do with the aliases Im trying to redirect.  They are both bound to the same site.p  pPotentially useful information Currently if you type in the vanitysub.domain.com it renders the correct site but the URL stays vanitysub.domain.com.  p  pSide note This is a Google analytics issue as well because our site has over 15 different subdomains so I have configured GA to prepend the sub.domain.com to the URI.  With the current scenario this generates two separate lines in my pageview report.  One for vanitysub and one for actual sub.p  pCan someone help me provide instruction for how to achieve what Im trying to do both without the rewrite extension and with it  The programmer does not have time to research it.  Im not a programmer but know enough to know I can be dangerousi.e. it can be done so I need your help.p  pThank youp

Negative 452 pIm making an image processing project which has a 6step algorithm and Im stuck in one of these.p  pFirst off all, the platform I using is MATLAB, so if you can supply some samples it would be great. But if you dont want to write code samples, please just give me some hints, techniques or etc.p  pLet me explain my problem. Ive segmented a .jpg image and cut out some areas of it. Then I save the result as .png using a mask. The result is like that The black part is actually transparent, I made it black to see better the problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFAyoM.png altenter image description herep  pAs you may see in the picture, there is some irrelevant areas. I need to get rid of these irrelevant areas. Because I want the foreground as much as smooth. At the first sight, I applied Gaussian blur to the mask and save the image as .png, again. But the result isnt satisfying as you can imagine. I suppose this situation is needed more solid solution than I have tried. p  pEdit1 I used spectral matting. But it doesnt help. The best result that I can receive is like thatp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWL5ck.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see there is some problems on the face and lots of problems on the bottom side of the picture. I guess I need kind of edge fixer or edge smoother for the first image above and it should be faster than matting.p  pAny MATLAB code samples, technique and approach would be great. If you need further explanation, feel free to ask.  p

But registering these services separately with AAD seems wrong as they would require the user to consent to them separately they are really part of the application. p  pSo Id like to use the JWT token I got from AAD when the user authenticated and use that as the bearer token for calling the downstream services. I realize that these services need to have the same audience as the MVC application.p  pBut how do I get that JWT token. The ClaimPrincipals first identity does not have a bootstrap context.p

Negative 452 pWhat is the fastest way to randomly but repeatedly permute all the bits within a Java byte array  Ive tried successfully doing it with a BitSet, but is there a faster way  Clearly the forloop consumes the majority of the cpu time.p  pIve just done some profiling in my IDE and the forloop constitutes 64 of the cpu time within the entire permute method.p  pTo clarify, the array preRound contains an existing array of numbers going into the procedure.  I want the individual set bits of that array to be mixed up in a random manner.  This is the reason for P[].  It contains a random list of bit positions.  So for example, if bit 13 of preRound is set, it is transferred to place P[13] of postRound.  This might be at position 20555 of postRound.  The whole thing is part of a substitution  permutation network, and Im looking to the fastest way to permute the incoming bits.p  pMy code so far...p  precode private byte[] permutebyte[] preRound      BitSet beforeBits  BitSet.valueOfpreRound     BitSet afterBits  new BitSetblockSize  8       for int i  0 i lt blockSize  8 i          assert i  P[i]           if beforeBits.geti              afterBits.setP[i]                     byte[] postRound  afterBits.toByteArray     postRound  Arrays.copyOfpostRound, blockSize       Pad with 0s to the specified length     assert postRound.length  blockSize       return postRound  codepre  pFYI, blockSize is about 60,000 and P is a random lookup table.p

Negative 452 pIn my program, I have a clock timer and I need it to be saved into a char array[10] which is then implemented into my highscore function. Through my program, I already have a formatted time. Example, if the clocks seconds is lower than ten, I have to add a zero. So, 002, and if the clocks seconds is greater than ten, it stays normal. Instead of me using two int variables in my struct, how can I just write a string into my text file For example, lets write a string called string clocksTime  015.  Note it has already been formatted. Here is my codep  precodestruct highscore       Want Change these two int values to a string     int clockMin     int clockSec   ...[Code]  Change the two variables to have it instead, data[playerScore].clock  clocksTime data[playerScore].clockMin  clockData.minutes data[playerScore].clockSec  clockData.seconds strdatedata[playerScore].Date   Write the variables into the text file streaming  fopen Highscores.dat, wb  fwrite data, sizeofdata, 1 , streaming  codepre

Negative 452 pI am working on a use case where I have a dependency on a downstream API. The issue is that a single resource for me is made up of multiple resources for the downstream service. So a single write to my API may be internally multiple calls to the external service and any one of those calls may fail. p  pIn the case of everything being good I am returning a 200 OK empty response and in the case of an invalid request or server error I am returning a separate error response. What should I return in the case of partial success I am aware of the 207 Multistatus response code but am not sure if that is applicable here since that looks like its more applicable to a batch operation.

Negative 452 pI have created a little setup with p and  elements, which I want to either be shown or hidden depending on the state of their designated checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, displayintial should be set, when the checkbox is unchecked, displaynone should be set. However, Ive been trying to find out how to do this with JS, but I havent gotten anywhere. An example of the code I havep  precodeltp idnr1 styledisplay initialgtNumber 1 Example text here ltpgt ltinput typecheckbox idnr1 checkedgt Number 1ltinputgt ltp styledisplay initial idnr1gt     ltimg srcsrcnr1.pnggt ltpgt codepre  pThe JS Ive managed to scramble together from what I could find look like thisp  precodefunction handleClickid      if document.getElementByIdid.display  checked          var element  document.getElementByIdid         element.style  displayinitial          else          var element  document.getElementByIdid         element.style  displayinitial       codepre  pHowever, I havent even been able to succesfully have the checkbox do ANYTHING. Ive tried it with IfElse simply popping up an alert with texts to see if I had been able to have anything happen upon checking and unchecking the checkbox. Its probably very obvious from the constructions Ive been building, but Ive never used JS before. I imagine it has to do something with onClick or onCheck, but neither have seemed to respond to anything at all.p  pSo what Im trying to do here is have the JS react upon checkingunchecking a checkbox. Id like to keep it as general as possible, because theres going to be somwhere between 1025 checkboxes, and having to hardcode it for every different HTML element wouldnt be the most ideal situation. The checkbox, Text element and Image all have the same ID to match them with. So if Checkbox 1 gets checked, Text element 1 and Image 1 will appear. If it gets unchecked, they both disappear. Anything to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 452 pI am working on a mac and I am writing a game in python and pygame that needs some sound files to be present in the same directory where the source code is. The thing is it works when I run the source code through the python interpreter. It doesnt work when I try to run the executable that has been compiled by cxFreeze. I have searched the internet for solutions but found nothing.p  pWhen python is interpreted the cwd would be the directory where the source code is in. When it is compiled with cxFreeze and ran through the terminal, the cwd would change to my home directory. This messes things up because I want to make this game portable and I need the sound files to be in the same folder as the executable.p  precodeimport os   Load the sound files. CWDPATH  os.getcwd BEEP1  pygame.mixer.Soundos.path.joinCWDPATH, beep1.wav BEEP2  pygame.mixer.Soundos.path.joinCWDPATH, beep2.wav BEEP3  pygame.mixer.Soundos.path.joinCWDPATH, beep3.wav BEEP4  pygame.mixer.Soundos.path.joinCWDPATH, beep4.wav codepre  pThis part of code is whats causing the problem. It runs smoothly when interpreted, but doesnt work when compiled with cxFreeze because os.getcwd evaluates to the home directory. I have tried putting os in packages option in the cxFreeze script as well. It doesnt work and I have worked on this hours without a solution. How can I get this to workp

So for example if I run codegetscalarspeedmax, toreturn  0code I would expect a numeric vector returned with the first rows being code24, 2, NA....code based on the data I pasted above because max of the first rows speedmax array is 24 and max of the second rows speedmax array is 2 and the 3rd row does not contain any relevant data 999 means omit.p  pI havent been able to find a way to write this with sapply to access the first member of the list for each cell. For example the following syntax errors outp  precodegt gg  maxmydata[[speedmax]][[1]] Error in functionx, i, exact if is.matrixi as.matrixx[[i]] else .subset2x,      object speedmax not found codepre  pAnd if I try an sapply rewrite like so, I cant seem to access the individual arrays per row.

Negative 452 pI am trying to extract data from a binary table in a FITS file using Python and astropy.io. The table contains an events array with over 2 million events. What I want to do is store the TIME values of certain events in an array, so I can then do analysis on that array. The problem I have is that, whereas in fortran using FITSIO the same operation takes maybe a couple of seconds on a much slower processor, the exact same operation in Python using astropy.io is taking several minutes. I would like to know where exactly the bottleneck is, and if there is a more efficient way to access the individual elements in order to determine whether or not to store each time value in the new array. Here is the code I have so farp  precodefrom astropy.io import fits  minenergy0.3 maxenergy0.4 xcen20000 ycen20000 radius50  datafilefits.opendatafile.fits eventsdatafile[EVENTS].data   datafile.close  times[]  for i in rangelenevents     energyevents[PI][i]     if energyltmaxenergy1000         if energygtminenergy1000             xevents[X][i]             yevents[Y][i]             radius2xxcenxxcenyycenyycen             if radius2ltradiusradius                 times.appendevents[TIME][i]  print times codepre  pAny help would be appreciated. I am an ok programmer in other languages, but I have not really had to worry about efficiency in Python before. The reason I have chosen to do this in Python now is that I was using fortran with both FITSIO and PGPLOT, as well as some routines from Numerical Recipes, but the newish fortran compiler I have on this machine cannot be persuaded to produce a properly working program there are some issues of 32 vs. 64bit, etc.. Python seems to have all the functionality I need FITS IO, plotting, etc, but if it takes forever to access the individual elements in a list, I will have to find another solution.p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 452 pRecently we ran into what looked like a connectivity issue when a particular customer of ours installed our product. We ultimately traced it to a low MTU 1300 bytes being configured on one of the devices in the network. In this particular deployment, we had two Windows machines running our application communicating with one another, and their link MTUs were set at 1500.p  pOne thing that made this particularly difficult to troubleshoot, was that our application would work fine during the handshake phase where only small requests are sent, but would strongemsometimesemstrong fail sending a specific request of size 4KB across the network. If it makes a difference, the application is written in C and these are WCF messages. p  pWhat could account for this indeterminism I would have expected this to always fail, as the message size we were sending was always larger than the link MTU perceived by the Windows client, which would lead to at least one full 1500byte packet, which would lead to problems. Is there something in TCP that could make it prefer smaller packets, but only sometimesp  pSome other things that we thought might be relatedp  p1 The sockets were constantly being set up and torn down as the application received what it interpreted as a network failure, so this doesnt appear to be related to TCP slow start.p  p2 Im assuming that WCF quickly pushes the entire 4KB message to the socket, so theres always something to send thats larger than 1500 bytes.p  p3 Using WireShark, I didnt spot any TCP retransmissions which might explain why only subsets of the buffer were being sent.p  p4 Using WireShark, I saw a single 4KB IP packet being sent, which perhaps indicates that TCP Segment Offloading is being implemented by the NIC Im not sure how TSO would look on WireShark. I didnt see in WireShark the 4KB request being broken down to multiple IP packets, in either successful or unsuccessful instances.p  p5 The customer claims that theres no route between the two Windows machines that circumvents the problematic device with the small MTU.p  pAny thoughts on this would be appreciated.p

Negative 452 pI am having an application developed with pure JSP and servlet. In one of my JSP pages, I have a field where it should auto complete when the user start typing. For this purpose, I used JQuery Auto Complete a hrefhttpsjqueryui.comautocomplete relnofollowhttpsjqueryui.comautocompletea pluging.p  pWhat I do is, I load data from my database using a Servlet and pass that data to the JSP as a codeBeancode. In my JSP, I use JSTL inside JavaScript for feeding the auto complete field.p  pBelow is the codep  precodeltscriptgt             function                   var availableTags[]                   ltcforEach varNamesList itemsrequestScope[NamesList]gt                      availableTags.pushNamesList.Name                 ltcforEachgt                  addTxt.autocomplete                     source availableTags                                   addTxt .autocomplete option, appendTo, .formhorizontal                  ltscriptgt    ltinput idaddDrugTxt namedrugTxt  classformcontrol inputmd gt codepre  pBut here is the best part. This list contains 22,500 elements. Some are long names, which could contain more than 5060 words. Now the issue is, eventhough it do not take much time to load the page, sometimes it get stuck when the auto complete starts. I guess it is searching for lot of elements and gets out of memory or something.p  pI also noticed the below behavior, which might cause this lag. Imagine I have texts like below.p  precodeCatBatDogSpace shipFrontLine Cat Bat Space Ship codepre  pIf I type Bat, my expectation is to find text strongstarting withstrong Bat, and not texts which may contain Bat somewhere in the middle. Since this kind of search taking time, I guess it is getting laggi as well, when there are 22,500 records.

Negative 452 pThis happened under heavy load peak processing  someone left a server snapshot on. For 2 days in a row, 2 packages which are part of 2 separate SQL server agent multi step jobs did not run did not create an extract and the next step in the job started this is not the trivial error where you forget to set On failure Quit the job reporting failure. In the job history, I see the steps reported DTSERSUCCESS0. All our packages run in a framework, all auditing info looks like its supposed to look step never ran, set to ready not  complete. After the snapshot was stopped, processing looks normal again all run times back to normal, both packages creating their extracts. I wonder if something isnt set correctly within all the packages. Does FailParentOnFailure have to be set to true for all components Thanks p

There is only one problem I am experiencing now It is detached from ADB frequently. I can start the emulator and load an app to run without any problem. However, after a while, it is detached without any warning. Android Studio and a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolshelpmonitor.html relnofollowAndroid Device Monitora do not see the emulator anymore while they can always see a physical device connected to the dev machine without any problem, so I assume ADB works fine.

Negative 452 pI am developing a hybrid iOS app, consisting of native parts storyboards, Swift code, CordovaPhonegap and Meteor as the server backend.p  pI know that theres a documentation on embedding Cordovas web views into native apps in the Cordova docsp  pa hrefhttpcordova.apache.orgdocsenedgeguideplatformsioswebview.md.htmliOS20WebViews relnofollowhttpcordova.apache.orgdocsenedgeguideplatformsioswebview.md.htmliOS20WebViewsap  pAccording to this documentation, all you have to do is to create an own view and call thisp  precodeCDVViewController viewController  [CDVViewController new] viewController.view.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 320, 480 [myView addSubviewviewController.view] codepre  pHowever, I can see in the standard Cordova projects that the standard Cordova AppDelegate is doing much more than this. For instance, it sets up a NSHTTPCookieStorage and also implements code to send information back from the native side to the web app.p  pI did not want to lose this functionality, which I assume is important. Hence, instead of just adding a view to one of my view controllers, I derived my own AppDelegate Swift class from the standard Cordova AppDelegate ObjectiveC class like thisp  precodeUIApplicationMain class MyCustomAppDelegate AppDelegate   override func applicationapplication UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions [NSObject  AnyObject] gt Bool    self.viewController  MainViewController   return true    codepre  pMainViewController is Cordovas standard view controller, so I also tried to reuse this to be as close to the standard as possible.p  pIn the view that embeds the Cordova web view, I am attaching the web view to the parent view like thisp  precodeoverride func viewDidLoad    super.viewDidLoad   let cordovaViewController  [... code to get the web view controller set by Cordovas app delegate]   cordovaViewController.view.frame  webappView.bounds   webappView.addSubviewcordovaViewController.view  codepre  pBasically, this works, but I am facing weird behaviour like the webview jumping out of the borders I have assigned to it in the storyboard as soon as I call plugins like the Cordova camera and return back from the camera view to my web view. In this case, I am seeing the following error message in Xcodes logp  precodePresenting view controllers on detached view controllers is discouraged codepre  pThis warning is actually rendered when the Cordova plugin calls presentViewController on its own view controller like this from the Cordova codep  precodeweak CDVCamera weakSelf  self  []  dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,              [weakSelf.viewController presentViewControllercameraPicker animatedYES completion                  weakSelf.hasPendingOperation  NO              ]           codepre  pThe warning message does not occur if I am using the standard Cordova Xcode project i.e. without my native part, so I can only guess that my view controller is floating around somewhere, unattached to something it should better be attached to. But I have no clue what this is.p  pSo I am wondering if anybody has some sample code out there that shows how to embed a Cordova view in a way that keeps all Cordova functionality up and running, but does not break anything.p  pThanks in advance for any advice, Tomp  pEDIT I now managed to get rid of the error by setting Cordovas view controller as a child view controller of my embedding container like thisp  precodeoverride func viewDidLoad    super.viewDidLoad   let cordovaViewController  ...   self.addChildViewControllercordovaViewController   cordovaViewController.view.frame  webappView.frame   webappView.addSubviewcordovaViewController.view   cordovaViewController.didMoveToParentViewControllerself  codepre  pYet still, I am asking myself if my way of integrating Cordova is the right way and would appreciate any sample code of existing hybrid apps.p

If it is the same never they get 10 points to their score. If they get it wrong they get the difference of the number the guessed and the number in the text file added to the score.

The console app does right the same. Profiling, timing and debugging always lead to codetable.Updatecode being the call with most cost. The SQL read shows no differences and ist therefor ruled out as cause of the problem.p  pThe reason for asking here was actually, that I need an idea, where I can further investigate, since the code itself shows no obvious differences.p  pThere is no reflection, generics, unsafe code or hidden artifacts in the calling methods runner vs console app, that could explain such behavior, since both of them only build the runtime parameters and call the job. I even compared these parameters by char. So I wondered, if there is some environmental difference between console app and VS test runner, since Im dealing with a COM object here.p
