Positive 2494 pThe DBAs wrote the proc with a print statement.  Other parts of the code can use this no problem.  But now we are encouraged to use entity queries against the database.p  pThe only return on the proc is an int of how many rows were changed.  In the store procedure is a Print statement of the results.  Is it possible to use entity in a way to grab that print statement as the proc executesp  pThanksp

Positive 2494 pI ran into this design questions. Experts please advise.p  pThere are 2 intranet applications. Once application needs data from other application. So I have 2 options. Either provide the data using a stored procedureSP or provide using web serviceWS. With the WS approach, the providing application has to be running for the consumer to use it. With the SP approach the consumer application can directly invoke the stored procedure with the caring if the other application is running or not.p  pWhich option is beneficialp
Positive 2494 pI ran into a surprise today, we are working on a application in C that connects to a mysql database. Everything worked fine until today when we migrated some stuff from one server to another. Now, some data are missing in the database and the Stored Procedures were expected to return null values because of it. Unfortunately instead of null values for integers we get integer values of 0.p  pFor simplicity lets say that I have the following stored procedure in our MySql Serverp  precodeCREATE DEFINERrootlocalhost PROCEDURE getconfigcode IN ordern BIGINT, IN orderpositionn INT, OUT outconfigcode BIGINT BEGIN     set outconfigcode  null END codepre  pthen I call the stored procedure through MySqlConnector .net by creating a MySqlCommand instance adding the parameters to it. Then the stored procedure is called in a very straightforward way as followsp  precodemReader  mCommand.ExecuteReader if mReader  null ampamp mReader .HasRows      mReader .Close  codepre  pthen I try to check if the parameter is Null like thisp  precodeif mCommand.Parameters[paramid].Value  System.DBNull.Value codepre  punfortunately despite the stored procedure explicitly setting the output parameter to null, the parameter is non null, and it is of type Int64 and has a value of 0 checked it through the debuggerp  pThe code works perfectly if data is actually there, and I get the correct integer value. My best guess is that it is not very easy to have a null integer value in c as it is a nonnullable type... but I expected the parameter to be of type System.DBNull anyway, even for nonnullable types it works perfectly for stringsp  pWhat am I missingp  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Positive 2494 pI have a SQL Server 2012 stored procedure that returns a table. I have to modify that SP to add an additional value to the returned table. Unfortunately, that added value comes from a call to a webservice. From my research, I gather the main ways to do this are using the OLE Automation procedures spOA... in SQL, or a SQLCLR stored procedure. Given the security context in which the spOA... procedures run, the single return value is a VARCHAR10 registration key, and calls to the service are few ten to twenty per hour, Im guessing the SQLCLR method is the way to go. Also, the webservice is hosted on our intranet, and not accessible to the outside world. p  pIs there a better way to accomplish what I need Better meaning more performant, better security, easier to code and maintainp

Negative 2494 pIm having a problem with FIREFOX.  I have an invisible list control over a dropdown control html select.  Dont mind why, but I will say that the overlayer is a popup that appears as part of another custom control.p  pEven though its hidden, its preventing me from clicking on the underlying dropdown control, making the underlying control seem disabled.  Its not disabled though, because I can tab over to it.  I just cant click on it.  I know its the overlay causing the problem, because I moved the underlying control off to the side and it works again.p  pIs this a bug in Firefox  This isnt like setting a translucency value its disabling rendering of the control altogether, so I dont think such an invisible control should be intercepting mouse events. This behavior does not occur in Internet Explorer.p  pPerhaps there is some other CSS property I can set in JavaScript to toggle its mouse event capturing ability along with its visibility.p  precodedd  document.getElementByIdlstStudents if dd.style.visibility  hidden dd.style.visibility  visible else dd.style.visibility  hidden codepre  pUpdate I just read a description for the CSS visibility value hidden that read The element is invisible but still takes up space.

Negative 2494 pI am having trouble using the XSLT 1.0 function library since .NETVisual Studio doesnt support 2.0, replacing attribute strings using XSLT in my XML document.p  pThe attributes contain URL strings, but as soon as the URLs are read in via the translate function, everything is garbled and comes out a mess.  This is most likely due to the encoding of the strings it is reading in and trying to write out.  Does anyone have a suggestion for a better way to readoutput the strings so that the URLs do not get garbledp  pLittle background on the issue.  I am creating a dynamic ASP.Net menu control, and populating it from an XMLDataSource.

In this way, I can just pass different parameters to the XSLT depending on which version I am buildingtesting.p  pHere is the XSLT codep  precodeltxslstylesheet xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransform version1.0gt ltxsloutput methodxml omitxmldeclarationyes encodingUTF8gt    ltxslparam nametargetStringgt   ltxslparam namereplacementStringgt    ltxsltemplate matchUrlgt     ltxslattribute nameUrlgt       ltxslchoosegt     ltxslwhen testcontains., targetStringgt       ltxslvalueof selecttranslate.,targetString,replacementString gt     ltxslwhengt     ltxslotherwisegt       ltxslvalueof select. gt     ltxslotherwisegt       ltxslchoosegt     ltxslattributegt   ltxsltemplategt    ltxsltemplate matchgt     ltxslcopygt       ltxslapplytemplates selectnode gt     ltxslcopygt   ltxsltemplategt  ltxslstylesheetgt codepre  pAnd here is the code in the event handler calling the XSLTp  precodeprotected void TransformEventHandlerobject sender, EventArgs e       Create an XsltArgumentList.

Negative 2494 pMy program needs to download object definitions basically xml files, maybe binary files on demand via the net. The program will request objects from my server during runtime. The only thing the program has to send the server is a string that identifies the object it needs e.g. RedCubeIn3DSpace23. So a basic Key, Value system. My app also has to have some basic authentication mechanism to make sure only legitimate programs access my servers info. Maybe send the license number and a password. What is the best way to go about implementing this I have 0 web knowledge so Im not sure exactly what technologies I need. I have implemented socket programs in college so maybe that is what I need Are there frameworks for this type of thing There could be thousands of usersclients simultaneously maybe more but I dont know. One super important requirement is that I need security to be flawless on the server side. That is, I cant have some hacker replacing object definitions with malicious one that clients download. That would be disastrous. p  pMy first thoughts    p  pSet up an ftp server and have each xml file will be named by the key value. Program logs in with its productid and fixed password and just does downloads. If I use a good ftp server, that is pretty impervious to a hacker modifying definitions.  Drawback is that its very non expandable nor flexible.   p  pRESTful type system. I just learned about this when searching stackoverflow. I can make categories of objects using URL but how do I do authentication and other actions. Might be hard to program but is this a better approach Is there a prebuilt library for this  p  pSockets using JavaC. JavaC would protect me from overflow attacks and then it is just a matter of spawning a thread on each connection and setting up simple messaging protocol and file transfers.  p  pSOAP. Just learned about it while searching. Dont know much.  p  pEC2. I think it and other cloud services add a db layer over it.  p  pThats what I can come up with, what do you think given my requirements I just need a little guidance. p

Negative 2494 pI have a Windows service running in local system that simply keeps trying to access a file with a UNC path of the form machinefolderfile.txt until it succeeds.

The codenet usecode call appears to immediately trigger my ability to access the shared folder from the service despite the fact that the codenet usecode call itself probably fails I havent checked because youre not even supposed to be able to map drives from a service. p  pThis sounds similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions687489databaseconnectiondoesntworkwhenservicestartsatbootbutworkswhenitsdatabase connection doesnt work when service starts at boot but works when its manually starteda but in my case it is a network shared folder, plus I know it can also suddenly just start working under the circumstances described above.p  pI dont think this is a permissions issue because it demonstrates full access capabilities on the shared folder when it succeeds in gaining access. But I would like to know the reason so I can handle it properly.p

Negative 2494 pMicrosoft word has a ton of proprietary formatting and styles that do not translate well to html WYSIWYG editors.

Negative 2494 pI learn best by taking apart something that already does something and figuring out why decisions were made in which manner.p  pRecently Ive started working with Perls CGIApplication framework, but found i dont really get along well with the documentation too little information on how to best structure an application with it. There are some examples of small applications on the cgiapp website, but theyre mostly structured such that they demonstrate a small feature, but contain mostly of code that one would never actually use in production. Other examples are massively huge and would require way too much time to dig through. And most of them are just stuff that runs on cgiapp, but isnt open source.p  pAs such I am looking for something that has most base functionality like user logins, db access, some processing, etc. is actually used for something but not so big that it would take hours to even set them up.p  pDoes something like that exist or am i out of luckp

Negative 2494 pI dont know if there is a specific name for this, but I am designing an application backed by a database in which rows need to be immutable not sure if that term applies here, but it is the closest to describing what I need.  That is, instead of changing the data stored in a row, a new row would be inserted with the same codeidcode but a different primary key.  There would be some metadata stored with row that would indicate which is the most current row for that codeidcode, and whether the record with that codeidcode has been deleted.  I would like to use an ORM in which I could use normal codeinsertcode, codeupdatecode, codedeletecode statements, but would do all that in the background.  Since I dont know what terminology to use, I am having a hard time finding a solution using the great, allknowing Google.  Does an ORM like this exist, or would I have to build one  modify an existing one  Any tips are appreciated.p

Negative 2494 pWe frequently take over the domain names of our clients when we take over the management of their site. Normally the transfer progress goes fine. However sometimes we have issues with DNS settings during the transfer progress as the transfer involves moving the DNS records to our registrars nameservers.p  pIt seems to be that the outgoing registrar is deleting the DNS info from their nameservers before we have a chance to manage the domain through our registrar and setup the DNS info on our registrars nameservers. This obviously leads to a few hours potentially a couple of days of downtime for users.p  pI am wondering if anyone else ever has this problem and if there is a way to avoid it. Is there some kind of a guideline for how long the outgoing registrars needs to keep the DNS info on their nameservers Or how should we manage this process to never have this downtime occur. As I said this only happens sometimes  and it alawys seems to be with with .com.net.org domains but not with .uk domains we are a UK based company.p

Negative 2494 pI am making a PHP frontend for a backend server using a custom protocol over TCP. Due to a fairly complex handshake when establishing connections to the backend server, I would like to persist the TCP connections to the backend server. Naturally, given the inherently stateless nature of HTTP and especially so when using modphp under Apache, I cannot do this directly in PHP.p  pI was thinking of having a local proxy server, maintaining a pool of connections to the backend server. It is important that each user of the PHP frontend maintains hisher own connection to the backend server. Now, this is not a very complex program, but due to the many pitfalls of network programming, I would rather use a robust, mature application that could do things like this.p  pI am thinking something along the line of the PHP application connecting to the proxy server, states I have an ID 123, and from then on all content tofrom the server is piped directly between the PHP frontend and the backend server.p  pAny suggestions on elegant solutions for thisp  pThanksp

Negative 2494 pHere is what Ive been struggling for a day...p  pI have a Message model in which coderecipientscode is a codeManyToManyFieldcode to the codeUsercode model. p  pThen there is a form for composing messages. As there are thousands of users, it is not convenient to display the options in a multiple select widget in the form, which is the default behavior. Instead, using FcbkComplete jquery plugin, I made the recipients field look like an input field where the user types the recipients, and it WORKS.p  pBut...p  pAlthough not visible on the form page, all the user list is rendered into the page in the select field, which is something I dont want for obvious reasons. p  pI tried overriding the ModelChoiceFields behavior manipulating validation and queryset, I played with the MultipleChoice widget, etc. But none of them worked and felt natural. p  pSo, what is the best way to avoid having the whole list of options on the client side, but still be able to validate against a querysetp

Negative 2494 pIm working off of this Railscast tutorial a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes247offlineappspart1 relnofollowepisode 247ap  pIm up to this point in the tutorial added the rackoffline gem, added the application.manifest route, and added a reference to the manifest in the html tag.  Right before it starts talking about problems with caching.p  pSafari works as intended  When the server is running the page is served.  From the server logs I can see that Safari is making a single request to the server every time for the items page.  When I turn off the server the page displays as well, even after shutting down the browser and restarting.  It appears to be pulling from the application.manifest cache manifest.p  pFirefox does not work as intended  When accessing the page for the first time, Firefox lets me know that the web page wants to store something locally, I allow.  After clicking on allow, Firefox makes 5 requests to the server for the page from the server log.  The hash is different in every request.  Is it is possible that the changing hash is triggering Firefox to keep trying to get the new manifest until it reaches some maximum 5 attemptsp  pThen, after the server is stopped, Firefox will not show the page at all.  It looks like it isnt caching the application.manifest.  Firefox also gives you a way to see what sites are storing stuff locally by going to ToolsOptionsAdvancedNetwork FirefoxPreferencesAdvancedNetwork on Apple.  I see localhost there but the size is 0 bytes.  So for some reason, Firefox is not downloading my application.manifest along with the filesp

Negative 2494 pA few weeks ago, I discovered that strings in C are defined as reference types and not value types. Initially I was confused about this, but then after some reading, I suddenly understood why it is important to store strings on the heap and not the stack  because it would be very inefficient to have a very large string that gets copied over an unpredictable number of stack frames. I completely accept this.p  pI feel that my understanding is almost complete, but there is one element that I am missing  what language feature do strings use to keep them immutable To illustrate with a code examplep  precodestring valueA  FirstValue string valueB  valueA valueA  AnotherValue  Assert.AreEqualFirstValue, valueB  Passes codepre  pI do not understand what language feature makes a copy of valueA when I assign it to valueB.

Negative 2494 pIm currently converting a program that was originally intended for OpenCL to C and Im having a bit of trouble with one particular part of it.p  pOne of the expressions commonly used in said program involves taking a 32 bit float, converting it to an integer i.e. not actually rounding it to an int, but interpreting the same data as an int  think reinterpretcast, performing some bit twiddling magic on it and then converting it back to a float once again, not actual conversion, but reinterpretation of the same data. While this works well in OpenCL, with C and gcc this violates strict aliasing rules, breaking the program if optimization is enabled and, depending on the architecture, may involve an expensive loadhitstore since float and integer registers are separated.p  pIve been able to avoid most of these expressions efficiently, but there is one Im not sure about whether it could be done faster. Basically, the intention is to clear a number of bits from the right of a float the OpenCL code does this similar to thisp  precodefloat ClearFloatBitsfloat Value, int NumberOfBits      return intasfloatfloatasintValue gtgt NumberOfBits ltlt NumberOfBits  codepre  pSince this is essentially rounding down from a specified binary digit, my C version now looks like thisp  precodefloat ClearFloatBitsfloat Value, int NumberOfBits      float Factor  pow2.0f, 23  NumberOfBits      return intValueFactorFactor  codepre  pWhere the codepowcode and the division are of course replaced by a LUT lookup and a respective multiplication, here omitted for better readability.p  pIs there a better way to do this What bugs me in particular is the int conversion to round down, which I guess is the most expensive part. It is guaranteed that the float passed to the function is a number between 1.0 inclusive and 2.0 exclusive, if that helps.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2494 pI am currently trying to develop a radar for discrete event simulation purposes. Suppose I have 2 objects Sensor S and Target T which are simply just points on screen. S is equipped with a Frustum based on specific parameters provided such as sensing distance, angle, ratio etc. That part I have already managed to develop. To put things into perspective, the Frustum begins from point S, and both S and T will move about randomly. The idea is for S to be able to detect T at discrete steps. Since S and T were programmed to move about linearly, discrete steps in this case refers to the time when either object changes direction in their movement.p  pMy question now is, given the x,y,z position and velocity of both S and T at every discrete step, how am I able to predict the time of detection i.e. intersection between the Frustum of S and point T, if any My code is currently only able to detect if a point is within the Frustum or not. But this is only useful if I am doing continuous time simulation. I am not sure as to how I should compute the intersection between a ray and the 6 planes that make up the Frustum while considering both the velocities of S and T. Some articles online mention that for dynamic object intersections, the general principle is to consider only one object to be moving before solving the equations for times t1 and t2 i.e. relative entry and exit times. However, that doesnt seem to be working for me.p  pPlease advise. Thanksp

But when I codeimport unicodeliteralscode, I cannot check if a string is of codelttype unicodegtcode becausep  ul liI assume codeunicodecode is not part of the namespaceli liif codeunicodecode is part of the namespace, a literal of codelttype strgtcode is still unicode when it is created in the same moduleli licodetypemystringcode will always return codelttype strgtcode for unicode literals in Python 3li ul  pMy modules use to be encoded in utf8 by a code coding UTF8code comment at the top, while my codelocale.getdefaultlocale[1]code returns cp1252. So if I call codeMyObjectacode from my console, it is encoded as cp1252 in Python 2, and in utf8 when calling codeMyObjectacode from the module. In Python 3, it will not be encoded, but a unicode literal.p  peditp  pI gave up hope about being allowed to avoid using  before a codeucode or codexcode for that matter. Also I understand the limitations of importing codeunicodeliteralscode. However, the many possible combinations of passing a string from a module to the console and vica versa with each different encoding, and on top of that importing codeunicodeliteralscode or not and Python 2 vs Python 3, made me want to create an overview by actual testing. Hence the table below. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsHQSx.gif altenter image description herep  pIn other words, codetypestrcode does not return codelttype strgtcode in Python 3, but codeltclass strgtcode, and all of Python 2 problems seem to be avoided. p

Negative 2494 pI have written a DLL that uses boost extensively in its implementation. I have both release and debug version of boost libraries with me libboostthreadvc80mt140.lib, libboostthreadvc80mtgd140.lib. I am using Visual studio to build my code and using autolinking. When i build the DLL in debug version it links itself with libboostthreadvc80mtgd140.lib which is expected, but when i am building my DLL in release mode it stills tries to link it with libboostthreadvc80mtgd140.lib instead of libboostthreadvc80mt140.lib.

Negative 2494 pMy app has 3,000 exam questions in .sqlite file. And these questions are dynamically selected and sorted by users demand for example, sort by count of wrong answer, select nonaccessed questions only.p  pWhenever user makes a selection, app makes corresponding SQL statement and by using sqlite3, all the result sets are sent into NSMutableArrayQuestion class.

Negative 2494 pI am kind of stumped. Recently our sys admin updated our expired SSL cert. Afterwards, all of our forms authentication applications are performing very slow, very slow to log in, very slow to go to any pages. However our Windows auth apps have no such slowdown.

I recycled all app pools, and stoppedstarted IIS service, didnt help.p  pI dont even know if the SSL cert is causing the slow down but nothing else has changed, we rolled back all application updates to before the SSL cert expired, and that didnt help.p  pI am not sure what else to check to debug this. Does anyone have any ideas We use .NET.p  pUsing firebug .NET tab I see the followingp  pIf I sit on the login page, and refresh, takes 128ms to load, no problems.p  pI enter in my login information and click login, it shows me a POST request on loginx.asp, status is 302 found, takes 20 seconds to process. After that it does a GET Default.aspx, also takes 20 seconds to process with a status of 200 OK.p  pLikewise the timeout occurs for each page a Navigate too, interesting enough the timeout is always around 20 seconds, is this indicative of something Could this be a DNS issue It occurs over HTTP and HTTPS.p  pI am not sure if there is anything indicative in the Paramsheaderspostresponse tabs for each request.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFnmmj.png altenter image description herep

Anyhow the weird thing is that the right hand side returns NULL 2 As for posting Equals function. Of course Ive implemented it. But it is irrelevant. Tracing the code in debug reveals that only hashcode is called. The reason for that is presumably the weird thing, the returned hashcode is different from the orignal one. In such cases the Map doesnt find a matching entry and therefore there is no need to call Equals.p

Negative 2494 pI am creating a web page which will be used to monitor and control some custom C programs. Ive created a page which will startstop a C program launcher nice generic name which then forks and creates a number of child processes. The starting works fine   codeexeccd launcherdir nohup .launcher gt outfile 2gtamp1 ampcodep  pThe stopping is where theres a problem. After clicking the stop button one of two things happens at random. Either there is a browser error page 101 Connection Reset or 324 Empty Response or the page is loaded twice, but you only see it the second time. The reason I know it loads twice is because of debugging messages in the code. In both cases the launcher process is killed sent SIGTERM. But if the page loads twice, on the first time it kills launcher nothing loads on the page for this part and the second time it checks and finds that no launcher process is running and displays a message Launcher is not running. p  pI am writing debug messages into a file and found that the reload occurs at a somewhat variable line in the php code sometimes a certain debug message will print, other times it wont. Also, php error reporting is set to ALL and no errors are given.p  pLauncher catches SIGTERM, sends SIGTERM to its child processes in turn, and then calls exit0. p  pInterestingly if SIGKILL is used to kill launcher, the php works fine and as expected, however this doesnt allow launcher to shut down nicely.

Negative 2494 pIm passing a map of strings from native c class to c using cCLI. Native code using stl map. In CCLI I convert each stl string to CString and insert to a Dictionary using String str  gcnew Stringumngd.cstr. Apart from the need to iterate the map which I wonder if there is a built in way to do, my problem is that this piece of code a very slow probably due to the many gcnew discrete memory allocations.

Negative 2494 pLets suppose I wanted to design a REST api which talks about songs, albums and artists actually I do, like 1312414 people before me.p  pA song resource always is associated with the album it is part of. Conversely, the album resource is associated with all songs it contains. The associations are expressed in the resource representations by way of links.p  pAs such, the representations would look something like thisp  precode    song xyz,    links [        rel album, url ...albumsabc     ]       album abc,    links [        rel song, url ...songsxyz ,        rel song, url ... ,        rel song, url ... ,        rel song, url ...     ]  codepre  pGiven, that I want this to hold true maybe the problem lies in the Given, how then do I design my API, such that the creation of an album or song resource does not have side effects on previously existing song or album resourcesp  pThis is some kind of a chickenegg problem. If I create a song resource first POST songs and then create an album resource POST albums, the song resource gets modified as part of the album creation which is bad according to REST principles, because the association between the two resources is being updated on the server. Likewise for the the scenario where I create the album first, the song second. p  pI guess I could avoid the whole issue by avoiding the side effect on the server and passing the burden of managing the bidirectional relationships to the client.p  pAlso, I dont want album and songs to be created atomically as a whole.p  pThe only thing I can think of right now, is to include the aforementioned side effect in the semantics of my API by responding to a resource creation with a representation which contains a list of links to resources which have been modified as a result of the request. That makes the side effect explicit, but still not restful though.p

Negative 2494 pI have a heap of audio files on a CDN. Those are mp3s and ogg vorbises, in parallel. Those files are each worth about one hour of playback. I need to extract arbitrary parts from those files I am given a filename I can choose if I use the mp3 or ogg version and two timestamps and I need the audio exactly between the given time positions. I dont want to download the whole file, so I think of using the Range http header.p  pI have complete control over the audio files, so I encoded them in fixed bitrate, to be able to estimate which bytes I should reach for. However, both formats use frames or pages in vorbiss case, which must be decoded atomically.p  pThe program I write is in Perl. I tried downloading a part of the file where I believe the given window to be contained, and then using AudioMad and OggVorbisDecoder to parse the audio file fragments. However, both seem to fail to process the fragments, and only succeed when I serve an integral file.p  pSo my question is How can I get an exact span of an audio file without downloading the whole thingp

Negative 2494 pIn my site SP2010 Ive created a trigger which adds a work item to the queue, through the SPSite.AddWorkItem method. This seems to do well, since the ScheduledWorkItems table is being filled with the correct data. Time is set in UTC and is the current or past time. IDs are all set OK as well. So the table has all the right data.p  pHowever, the custom created Work Item processor, derived from SPWorkItemJobDefinition, with the correct ID, is never being fired. The AppPool user who adds work items is also a farm admin. There are no entries in the event log or sharepoint log files concerning this process, so its not even being triggered.p  pAny more prerequisites for successfully deploying and firing a work item jobp
Negative 2494 pI am using ColdFusion 8 and jQuery 1.7.2.p  pI am using CFAJAXPROXY to pass data to a CFC. Doing so creates a JSON array argument collection and passes it through the URL. The string can be very long, since quite a bit of data is being passed.p  pThe site that I am working has existing code that limits the length of any URL query string to 250 characters. This is done in the application.cfm file by testing the length of the query string.  If any query string is great than 250 characters, the request is aborted.  The purpose of this was to ensure that hackers or other malicious code wouldnt be passed through the URL string.p  pNow that we are using the query string to pass JSON arrays in the URL, we discovered that the Ajax request was being aborted quite frequently.p  pWe have many other security practices in place, such as stripping any lt tags from code and using CFQUERYPARAM.p  pMy question is whether limiting the length of a URL string for the sake of security a good idea or is simply ineffectivep

I am using SQL Server 2008 and IIS ver 7.5. p  pI am running into an error when I try to open a connection to the database.p  pI used the advice in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1359579classicaspsqlserver2008connectionstringusingwindowsauthenticationthis postap  pto use a .udl file to create and test my connection string so I know the connection string works. I am using Windows Authentication and I am certain the app pool that is running this site has access to the database as I use the same pool for multiple sites and they can all connect fine. p  pWhen opening the connection I am trying to run a stored procedure, if I just write out the stored proc string and run it directly in my database it works as expected. p  pHere is the codep  precodeConst adUseClient  3 Const adCmdStoredProc  4 Const adOpenStatic  3 Const adLockBatchOptimistic  4  dim connectstring,sql connectstring  ProviderSQLOLEDB.1Integrated SecuritySSPIPersist Security InfoFalseInitial CatalogmydatabaseData SourcelocalSQLEXPRESS sql  MyProc  amp param1 amp , amp param2 amp  set rs  Server.CreateObjectADODB.RecordSet rs.CursorLocation  adUseClient rs.CursorType  adOpenStatic rs.LockType  adLockBatchOptimistic  this is where it is failing rs.Open sql, connectstring, 3 codepre  pOne of the problems is the error I get seems to be generated by IIS, it simply says p  pAn error occurred on the server when processing the URL.

I cant seem to find where to get information about the error. As a last resort I checked in Event ViewerWindows applications logs but there was no entry for my errors.p  pIve Googled and tried multiple permutations on the connection string but to no avail. If anyone had any advice on how to solve this problem, or even an idea of where to look for a solution I would be grateful. Thanks much p  pemEDIT emp  pOk I changed IIS settings to show errors in the browser and now I am getting an error message that is a bit more useful, here it isp  blockquote   pMicrosoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error 80004005p      pCannot open database rwgp requested by the login.

I have multiple ASP.NET sites set up locally that run in this app pool and they can connect using integrated security. Im not sure what is going wrong, does anyone have any suggestions p

Negative 2494 pThe Dutch and German language do have words that can be combined to emnewem words compound words. p  pFor example accountmanager is considered one word, compounded by the words account and manager.

Negative 2494 pIm using standard container authentication for a multimodule application, deployed on latest Glassfish server 3.1.2.p  pI used to have form authentication for the main web module and http basic authentication for a module containing rest web services.p  pNow, for both modules, I need to be able to perform certificate authentication, but only as an option. Some clients still need to be able to login via form  basic auth.p  pI tried to use JSR196 to intercept certificate authentication data forwarded by a reverse proxy. The problem here is, in Glassfish, it seems I need to reimplement some help that the container provides if I use JSR196 storing authentication in session, SSO, even formbasic authentication... Its Glassfish way or mine, it seems, but I want a mix. So, my JSR196 module now needs to handle cert, basic and form authentication as well as persistence mechanics. Looks overkill.p  pI tried a more naive approach, namely using form authentication and have my reverse proxy send authentication data to jsecuritycheck. It works for the first module, but is too implementation specific and really looks like an hack.p  pI also imagined doing cert authentication in another module, directly on the app server without reverse proxy and redirecting to the original module once authenticated, using sso as glue. But sso on glassfish wont work between modules which have different auth types.p  pId rather use something standard, elegant if possible. Also, I want my application to use Java EE security, not some 3rd party lib, be it from Spring or anything else.p  pWhat are the options for implementing this on Glassfishp

Negative 2494 pI run a console application and declared and instantiated an object of type codeFoocode. Besides the codeMaincode method I want to specify an additional method lets call it codeProcessMessagescode and have it perform some work. The main job of codeFoocode is to accept messages that are sent to a tcp socket and processed. As part of the process I need to specify a function codefuncltTgtcode to which such messages are passed. codeProcessMessagescode outside of Foo is supposed to be such function. How can I register this function with foo without having to pass reference to its containing class p  pFoo contains a TPL data flow bock which requires a codefuncltTgtcode which operates on the queued items in the block. But the function is not contained within Foo but in the class that instantiated an object of type Foo. I am looking for the fastest way of later on calling this method even if I have to write more elaborate code. Ultimately I want to hide the underlying tpl data flow block within Foo and only want to call a function in Foo that sets up a tpl data flow block and registers with it a method that is located outside of Foo to which items can be passed later on. What is the best way to get this done The registration part is the one which puzzles me. p  pEDIT Here is some code that describes maybe better what I try to achievep  pa In Main I have the following method which is getting called from within a different classp  precodepublic void OnControlMessageobject sender, EventArgs args              Console.WriteLineComp1 received Control Message      codepre  pI register this Method in the following wayp  precodeListltZeroMqMessaging.CallBackMethodgt registeredMethods  new ListltZeroMqMessaging.CallBackMethodgt              new ZeroMqMessaging.CallBackMethodMessageType.ControlMessage, OnControlMessage  codepre  pb The ActionBlock that invokes the callback looks as followsp  precodeActionBlockltTupleltint, byte[]gtgt newActionBlock  new ActionBlockltTupleltint, byte[]gtgtx gt callback.eventHandlerthis, new MyEventArgcallback.messageType, x.Item2 codepre  pOnControlMessage gets called correctly, however, I need to pass specific messages to OnControlMessage as part of EventArgs. I created a class MyEventArg that derives from EventArg but I still am not able to access members of MyEventArg in OnControlMessage. p  pPreferably I like to have OnControlMessageControlMessage message... in order to not to have to cast. How can I register this OnControlMessage so that I can call back this method with arguments of my choosing I have potentially many different such callback methods so requirement is to stick to a 1line short way to register as I currently do in a when I create CallBackMethod objects. I hope this is somewhat clearer. p

Negative 2494 pI hope someone can give me some guidance in how to best approach this situation. I am using dbcontext, wpf and sql server. I am having situations were the presentation of the data requires other data than just what is coming from a single table. For example, if I had a person table but wanted to show also how many books they had read from related data, say fields would be name, address, NoOfBooks. I currently create a new class, called say PersonBookPM, that I fill up with data from a linq query which combines the two tables which includes the above three fields.I create an observablecollection of that and make that the itemssource of the gridlistbox. When I am then adding data to that I then need to use the selecteditem, convert that back to the single entity of person, and attach it back in to the context. It seems like the classes have already been defined by the code gen and I am repeating the process only slightly differently. Am I going round the houses here Thanks Scottp

We can then delete the cached copy via the control panel and the uncached page will be served until we cache that page again.p  pLong story short, we know that a either a proxy server or load balancer was put in place, and we think that it is caching the pages as well as the CMS. Our specific issue is that when we uncache the page in the CMS, its taking 15 minutes timed to show up uncached even after using different browser, clearing the browser cache, etc., when prior to the network appliance being introduced, the uncached page would show up immediately. Unfortunately we dont have any historical response headers saved anywhere.p  pWhen we believe that the page is being cached by the proxylb, the Response header is returningp  precodeHTTP1.1 304 Not Modified Server Apache2.0.59 Unix JRun4.0 modssl2.0.59 OpenSSL0.9.8k PHP5.2.6 LastModified Fri, 03 Aug 2012 132912 GMT Etag 92fe18f7837ada00 AcceptRanges bytes KeepAlive timeout5, max100 ContentType texthtml ContentEncoding gzip Connection KeepAlive Date Mon, 06 Aug 2012 134940 GMT XCntntLength 6391 codepre  pWhen its not being cached by the CMS, the response headers arep  precodeHTTP1.0 200 OK Date Mon, 06 Aug 2012 140359 GMT Server Apache2.0.59 Unix JRun4.0 modssl2.0.59 OpenSSL0.9.8k PHP5.2.6 XPoweredBy PHP5.2.6 SetCookie blahblahblah Expires Mon, 26 Jul 1997 050000 GMT LastModified Mon, 06 Aug 2012 140404 GMT Pragma nocache Connection close ContentType texthtml codepre  pI guess my question is, can Apache2 be configured to return both HTTP 1.0 and 1.1  I know the Etag indicates a cached page, and believe its not available in HTTP1.0. p  pThanks for any insights.p

Negative 2494 pI am attempting to create a WinForm menu system in C for WinCE 6.0.p  pThe general idea for this menu system is that there are a few picture boxes that act as buttons along the bottom of the screen. These allow for switches between general settings screen brightness, language, etc., datetime settings and other system specific settings. And there are a few more picture boxes that act as buttons in the middle of the screen along with labels defining the options for the user.p  pSo, quick example. Entering the settings menu brings you to the general settings by defaultp  precodelabelTitle.Text  General labelOption1.Text  Brightness picOption1Left.Image  bmpDown picOption1Right.Image  bmpUp codepre  pTapping on the down arrow next to brightness, will lower the screen brightness up arrow will raise brightness.p  pTapping the DateTime option button along the bottom of the screen will change these fields to the followingp  precodelabelTitle.Text  Date and Time labelOption1.Text  Time picOption1Left.Visible  false picOption2Right.Image  bmpInput codepre  pOnly one image is used for this setting. Tapping the input image will allow the user to input the time through a virtual keyboard, or possible other means.p  pThats the basic concept. The problem is that after switching images and or toggling the .Visible value between true and false eventually cause the device to stall and crash. My troubleshooting so far makes me think this is some sort of issue with memory.p  pWhy would I be consuming memory enough to make the device crash just by toggling visibility or changing the image associated with an asset Tested and both functions will cause the crash. Is there something bad about programming a menu system this way Is there a better way to reach this goal Should I consider programming in a different language since an embedded device will be more limited I appreciate any thoughts andor advice on the matter.p  pThanksp

Negative 2494 pCurrently I take part in developing a system based on Java EE WebLogic server, to be more precise and I am wondering how to protect some private data from administrators. For example, some parts of a system stores credentials for legacy systems in a deployment descriptors as plain text and this is bad because a deployer can read application configuration file codeejbjar.xmlcode, for example and steal username and password for powerfull account. I want to close this security hole, but dont know how.p  pNow I am interested in protecting this kind of datap  ol liLoginli liPasswordli liPrivate key for symmetric encryptionli ol  pFrom a hrefhttpkingsfleet.blogspot.com200812storingpasswordsomewheresafe.html relnofollowherea Ive discovered that I can use a JCEKS keystore to protect this type of information, but I can not understand how to use it. My application still should contain the kestore password and the key password to access it. So, a depoyer can steal passwords for keystores and keys, find my secure storage and steal credetials. Obviously, I can revoke codereadcode privileges from the deployer account, but then he can decompile my appliaction and develop his own similar app or edit my one, that simply prints secure data to some file or send it by email... And now I am stuck... p  pCan anybody give me some links that can explain how to protect a system from administrators Weblogic related links will be preferable. I totally understand that it is not possible to protect from all administrators and there should be some codesecurity administratorcode that will be responsible for keystore management and so forth, but I want to secure all sensitive data from everybody else.p  pstrongRESULTSstrong p  pBoth emjtahlbornems and emslimems answers are correct, but emslimsems answer in more interesting. I think that in my case it will be appropriate to accept only signed applications for installation on the server. This decidion can solve problem with applicatoin modifications done by a administrator. Administrators will have password from keystore and all keys, but they will not have access to keystore file at all. Access to keystore file will have only special security administrators rw and server r. So, everybody will have the key, but nobody except security administrators will have access to the box.p

I populated the tableView with some allthesame cells for testing it but the table view wont show floating section headers, the only thing where I can see section titles by the way Anno 1 and Anno 2 are the titles I need to show is the bar on the right is there anyway to hide this index bar.p  pCan anybody help me in getting the tableview to show the section titles Shouldnt it show them automatically or is there any property I must set in order to get them p
Negative 2494 pFollowing problem were using gated build with TFS 2012. As soon as the TFS starts the build, everything is just copied into one folder. p  ul liOur actual application is a Silverlight application. li liOur unit tests though are put in .Net projectsli ul  pOne part of our application uses 3rd party controls. It uses a Silverlight assembly, which grants a certain functionality. The same functionality is given in a .Net assembly, which we use in a parallel project for serverside stuff and unit testing. It actually grants the same functionality except the UI things. Both of those assemblies are referenced with copy local  true.p  pIf I build the solution stronglocallystrong which contains both assemblies referenced in different projects, everything works fine. But as soon as I try to deploy it via TFS, the build fails because of a strongFileIOExceptionstrong or something. It tells me that the 3rd party assembly is not the proper file. p  pI think that occured, because when the TFS starts building, strongeverythingstrong gets copied into one folder. strongBothstrong the .Net assembly and the Silverlight assembly. They both have the strongsamestrong file name. I think thats, what messes up the TFS build.p  pDo you have any suggestions for this problem Its a requirement that we still have the uber solution, which contains all the projects. So splitting up .Net and Silverlight projects isnt a solution.p

Negative 2494 pI am trying to create a web API that allows someone well, preferably a program to submit a large binary file and receive an ID for that file in return. I have some HTML with a form codemethodPOSTcode and an codeltinput typefile ...gtcode element that can submit a file to some PHP code, using the standard multipartformdata MIME type. The PHP generates the ID and prints it out as its result. Because the PHP simply prints the ID, as opposed to redirecting to another HTML page or generating HTML itself, it is not very pretty, but hopefully is sufficient for the intended use case of a programmatic file submit API.p  pSo far, so good. It gets tricky when I want to have clientside code capture the returned ID and invoke other APIs with it. If the client is a web page with JavaScript, it seems like the client should use codeXMLHttpRequestcode, but it is not clear to me how to get that object to use the file the user selected with the file input control.p  pI would love for the same API to work both with manually operated web forms for easy UI and testing, and purely programmatic invocation like with JavaScript, curllibcurl, etc.. I dont want the PHP to issue a redirect to another page with the ID in the query string, and I dont want to return HTML directly. I just want a simple file in, ID out API.p  pSince this is proving difficult I suspect I am going about things the wrong way. I am open to alternative designs, but I would prefer to keep things as simple as possible. I found a somewhat a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1156429howdoiwritearestfulwebservicethatacceptsabinaryfilepdfsimilar questiona, but it is too Javacentric and doesnt quite address my problem.p

Negative 2494 pI am working on a site that will have a lot of images inside of boxes divs sorted as a grid absolute positioning. I have noticed that resizing the images to fit the boxes causes the site to slow down significantly. There are a lot of images 342, but I dont understand why this is the case as the site runs quickly when I dont resize them.p  pPlease note I plan on implementing the dynamic resizing of the boxes in the future. strongI mention this to avoid the answer of saving every image at another size. I am interested in knowing the cause of the slowdown not a different method of implementation.strongp  pThe grid is initially made up of boxes divs that are 150px  150px. The grid is in the codeltbodygtcode and initially has no images just empty divs. When the body has loaded, a JavaScript function places the images into their appropriate box. The JavaScript function relies on PHP for getting the images from a database as well as for resizing. Here are the steps for that section of PHPp  p1. PHP gets image filename from database.p  p2. PHP gets image dimensions in pixels and saves them into two variables. Ill call them x and y here.p  p3. I change x and y so that the image will fit 150px  150px or whatever initial value I assign to the boxes initial dimensions.p  p4. I use codeechocode to codewrite document.getElementByIdPHP given Id.innerHTML  ltimg srcPHP given filename stylewidthPHP x value heightPHP y valuegtcode.p  pIf I comment out step 3 in my code the site runs quickly that is commenting out the part that changes x and y from the image default dimensions. I have also tried setting the width and height attributes of the codeltimggtcode instead of inline CSS but that does not solve the slowness issue.p

I have a mess, a big on, that I am trying to rebuild using a MVC, which thats not really the problem. p  pThe problem is, is the 20,000 or so files and images that have been stored in articles, and various other things on this site over the ages.

Bottom line is I wanna know if theres a means of mean taking failed image and file requests and mapping them to a new folder that will have either all these images or files in them. Is this something htaccess can do alone or is this something I will have to come up with a means of serverside script and htaccess or is it the worst case where I am going to have to take the hit for files not found, and route them all to a single error page, saying the files have been movedp  pNot sure what would be a good course of action for this problem so I havent tried anything yet, kinda trying to feel it out and see where I have to go from there.p

Negative 2494 pIm using Harvest Chosen for some dynamic select elements, but Im running into a problem where if the select element is near the bottom of the page the select list gets cut off.  The containing div is set to overflowhidden, and for some reason changing that to overflowvisible results in a scrollbar showing up inside the container div.  p  pIt would be really nice if I could just get the options list to behave like a normal dropdown, and render upwards when the bottom would get clipped.p  pSo is there some magic css or maybe javascriptjquery that could force the div to show on top of the select element instead of below it, but only when it would be cut off by the containing elementp  pOr better yet an option in the Harvest Chosen plugin that I missedp

I set the filter as Include Only  Traffic from the ISP domain  that contain  scavengerhunt.orgp  pI can see no traffic in the reports when I remove the filter I can see traffic of course. Any ideas Ilanp
Negative 2494 pI have to pwrite characters to a text file with each character representing 1 byte. Also, I need to write integers to the text file, so 12 has to be one byte also, not 2 bytes even though two characters.p  pI am using char pointer for the characters and integers, but I am getting stuck since the text fill prints jumbled values for the integers s, upsidedown s, etc. Like when I pwrite pointer[0]  105 The 105 translates i in the text.txt file and pread reads as i Somehow the 105 is lost in translation.p  pAny ideas how to pwritepread correctlyp  precodeofstream file file.opentext.txt char characters  new char characters[0]  105 cout ltlt pwrite3, characters, 1, 0 codepre  pAlso, the 3, is the filedes, which I guess P Dont know how to actually find.

Negative 2494 pIm pretty new to CQt and Im trying to create an application with Visual Studio C and Qt 4.8.3. The application displays images using a QGraphicsView, I need to change the images at pixel level.p  pThe basic code is simplified p  precodeQImage img  new QImageimgwidth,imgheight,QImageFormatRGB32 whiledosomestuff    imggtsetPixelx,y,color  QGraphicsPixmapItem pm  new QGraphicsPixmapItemQPixmapfromImageimg QGraphicsScene sc  new QGraphicsScene scgtsetSceneRect0,0,imggtwidth,imggtheight scgtaddItempm ui.graphicsViewgtsetScenesc codepre  pThis works well for images up to around 12000x6000 pixel. The weird thing happens beyond this size. When I set codeimgwidth16000code and codeimgheight8000code, for example, the line codeimg  new QImage...code returns a null image. The image data should be around 512,000,000 bytes, so it shouldnt be too large, even on a 32 bit system. Also, my machine Win 7 64bit, 8 GB RAM should be capable of holding the data.p  pIve also tried this version p  precodeuchar imgbuf  uchar mallocimgwidthimgheight4 QImage img  new QImageimgbuf,imgwidth,imgheight,QImageFormatRGB32 codepre  pAt first, this works. The img pointer is valid and calling codeimgwidthcode for example returns the correct image width instead of 0, in case the image pointer is null. But as soon as I call codeimgsetPixelcode, the pointer becomes null and codeimgwidthcode returns 0.p  pSo what am I doing wrong Or is there a better way of modifying large images on pixel levelp  pRegards, Davidp

Up to now, Jackson wasnt having to handle the codeownerscode object, and now that it is it is choking on it, namelyp  blockquote   pcodeJsonMappingExceptioncode Can not deserialize instance of codejava.lang.Stringcode out of    codeSTARTOBJECTcode token at [char position where you can find codeuserIDcode and codepaidIDcode]    through reference chain [path to my Jackson bean which contains the owners class]p blockquote  pMy Jackson bean has a wrapper, which is what that exampleList is all aboutp  precodepublic class Examples extends HashMapltString, ArrayListltExamplegtgt    codepre  pAnd then the actual codeExamplecode classp  precodeJsonIgnorePropertiesignoreUnknown  true public class Example implements ComparableltExamplegt   ObjectId Id private String id  JsonPropertyConstants.Example.location private String location  JsonPropertyConstants.Example.OWNERS private ListltOwnersgt owners  public int compareToExample o      return getId.compareToo.getId   public String getId      return id   public void setIdString id      this.id  id   public String getLocation      return location   public void setLocationString location      this.location  location  public ListltExample.Ownersgt getOwners      return owners   public void setOwnersListltExample.Ownersgt owners      this.owners  owners   public Example    JsonCreator public ExampleId ObjectId String id      this.id  id   JsonIgnorePropertiesignoreUnknown  true public static class Owners implements ComparableltOwnersgt       JsonPropertyConstants.Example.USERID     private String userID      JsonPropertyConstants.Example.PAIDID     private String paidID      public Owners            public int compareToOwners o          return getUserID.compareToo.getUserID           ObjectId     public String getUserID          return userID           ObjectId     public void setUserIDString userID          this.userID  userID           ObjectId     public String getPaidID          return paidID           ObjectId     public void setPaidIDString paidID          this.paidID  paidID          codepre  pAnd finally, the code in the ResponseHandler where this is all failing the 2nd line produces the JsonMappingExceptionp  precodeobjectMapper  MongoJacksonMapperModule.configureobjectMapper     mExamples  objectMapper.readValuejsonParser, Examples.class codepre  pI have a feeling the issue is that Jackson still doesnt know how to map those codeoidcode, which are the mongoDB ObjectIds. The MongoJacksonMapper library is supposed to help that by providing the codeObjectIdcode annotation and a way to configure the ObjectMapper to use that library, but it still isnt working. For some reason, its still looking for the userID or paidID as a String, not an ObjectId. Any ideasp

Negative 2494 pIm currently working through John Zelles Python Programming An Introduction to Computer Science and hit a snag in Chapter 10. Im having a conceptual issue in understanding the why and how of this exercise and require some assistance on how to approach the problem. The exercise asks me to create a program that displays emnem number of cards using a class named codeCardcode and requires the following methods. It should also be callable from within an app that generates emnem number of random cardsp  ol licodeinitself, rank, suitcode li licodegetRankselfcodeli licodegetSuiteselfcodeli licodeBJValueselfcodeli licodestrselfcodeli ol  pAs ridiculously easy as this should be, I hit a wall trying to implement this class. I created a simple app that would generate a deck of 52 cards, prompts the user for the number of cards they want, and then populates the hand with those cards. I just cant see where I would benefit from a card specific class once the hand is generated. Heres my working code so farp  precodeimport random  class Card     def initself, rank, suite         self.rank  rank         self.suite  suite      def getRankself         return self.rank      def getSuiteself         return self.suite      def BJValueself         if self.rank  Ace             return 1         elif self.rank  Jack or self.rank  Queen or self.rank  King             return 10         else         return intself.rank      def strself         return 0 of 1.formatself.rank, self.suite   def shuffleddeck     deck  []     for suite in [Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades]         for num in [Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King]             deck.append[num, suite]     random.shuffledeck     return deck   def main     deck  shuffleddeck     hand  []     printgtgt Card Generator v1 ltlt     while True         try             n  intinputPlease enter the number of cards to display 17          except ValueError             printInvalid input, please enter a numbern         else             if n lt 1 or n gt 7                 printPlease enter a number between 17n             else                 break     printYour hand is     for i in rangen         hand.appenddeck[i]    main codepre  pSo once Ive generated the hand of random emnem cards, I cant see how I would benefit from using the Card class, or even where to implement it. Since emnem is a random number between 17, I would need emnem number of variables to store each card object and then assign each variable to an instance of codeCardcode. I could show each card in the hand with codehand[i]code where i iterates through to coderangencode without the need of a special codeCardcode class, but thats not whats expected from this project. Im looking for advice on how to think about this issue so that I can make use of this required class.p

Negative 2494 pI decided to start using the Git version control system for my C project. Im new to version control.  For the trunk things are simple, I just commit all the project versions I have. I kept each version as a separate folder because I knew Id very soon use Git. But I encountered a problem with my branches.p  pAt some stage of the development, I decided theres one class I want to develop in a branch. Without version control, I had to use make a manual branch. I copied the most recent header file and source file of that class to a separate folder and started working there. I made several  versions there to work with simultaneously. One version was the first prototype of the class according to the plan for which I made the branch. Then I added another file, in which I copied the first one but removed things that seemed to not be necessary. This way I have 2 versions, one with all my ideas and features, the the other one just with what I really use in my code, without whats not in use at the moment.p  pBut then I added more. As development went on, I decided it may be a good idea to make that class a template. So I added a third version, which is just like the second one, but now some functionality implemented using polymorphism is implemented using a template. And I cant tell yet which version is the best, as its too early to tell, so I want to have all 3 together.p  pThen I made another special file A copy of the third version header file, in which each line can be marked or not marked. Marked means I use that specific method or Im sure its going to be in use very soon, otherwise the line isnt marked.p  pThen, some time later, I started a new branch. And for that branch I needed a new version of that class developed in the first branch. So I just copied one of the versions to the new branchs folder and started working there. Now again I had some kind of auxiliary file I had 2 files, one from which I delete class methods I use, and one into which I write new methods I need to have.p  pNow I want to start using Git and I wonder For all the projects text files, plans, diagrams, etc., it obvious  I keep them outside the Git repo. Whenever collaborative editing is needed I can set up a wiki or something like that. But for all those copies of the same header file, and for those auxiliary marked files, what do I do with them I mean, its fine by me to have them all in a branch, but what happens when I merge a branch into the trunk I dont want to have all these copies and versions and lists, just the one final class file Ive made.p  pOn one hand, these are C source files used while coding. On the other hand theyre not part of the pure source code of the software package, they just help me while I work but will never get compiled because in the end theres just the final version of the class which I chose to merge, and all other aux files, lists, etc. are kept just for reference.p  pWhat would be the best thing to do Thanks for reading my long story p  pEDIT Its a local repo on my personal computerp

Negative 2494 pIm building a library Foo on top of a third party library Bar which requires an codeInitialisecode free function to be called at the start of any program which uses it, and a codeDeInitialisecode function at the end. I would like to cascade these function through to my library, so that the user is required to initialise mine, without needing to know anything about the third party librarys initialisation. In addition, I can perform any other initialisation my library may require, in the same place. I could just use my third party librarys approach using free functions e.g.p  precodenamespace Foo     Initialise           BarInitialise        Do rest of Foos initialisation        DeInitialise           BarDeInitialise        Do rest of Foos deinitialisation      codepre  pThe user of Foo would then be required to call codeFooInitialisecode before using it and codeFooDeInitialisecode at the end, and has the responsibility to ensure that it is only called once thus I can avoid worrying about thread safety issues.p  pThis is the approach that Ive mostly come across when searching for solutions to this problem. However Im now considering placing all my initialisation and deinitialisation in the constructor  destructor of a class e.g.p  precodeClass Initialiser     Initialiser           BarInitialise        Do rest of Foos initialisation        Initialiser           BarDeInitialise        Do rest of Foos deinitialisation      codepre  pThus freeing the user from having to worry about deinitilisation  they just create an codeInitialisercode object on the stack at the start of their program, and the destructor will take care of the rest when the program exits.p  pMy question is is this a reasonable approach Are there any potential pitfalls or alternative solutions to consider Is it even valid to have a class with only a constructor and a destructor but no data membersp

Negative 2494 pI am currently trying to learn reflection and have seen some examples where GetConstructor is used, i guess that it is one of the basic functions i need to understand, to be able to start work with reflection.

If a reason exists, can someone explain why a type array is used as inparameterp

Negative 2494 pIm having some seriously confusing Game Center problems.p  pMy app runs on iOS 6 and above only, and Ive been using the standard code for authenticating with Game Centerp  precodeGKLocalPlayer localPlayer  [GKLocalPlayer localPlayer] localPlayer.authenticateHandler  UIViewController viewController,                                      NSError error       Respond to authentication failure or success here  codepre  pWith this code, the app has been running beautifully and without issue for weeks, for myself during development and with 1015 beta testers in ad hoc distributions.p  pFor most of this time, and for most users, the app behaves as you expect if you arent logged into Game Center when the app launches, or are logged into a production Game Center account, the app prompts you with the modal Game Centerthemed View Controller to log in with a Sandbox account. You log in to your sandbox account, and everything Just Works.p  pFor a few users, though, something very strange has begun to happen.p  pThe codeauthenticateHandlercode code is called, codeerrorcode is codenilcode, but code[GKLocalPlayer localPlayer].authenticatedcode is codeNOcode, and the user is not logged into Game Center. Most important, there is emnoem modal Game Center dialog to prompt the user to log in. The app simply launches, the codeauthenticateHandlercode code is called, but no authentication takes place. I think the app would work if the Game Center app would allow me to log in with my sandbox account, but it doesnt logged in or out of my production Game Center account, there is no sandbox login option.p  pSince this only happens to emsomeem users, and has only begun to happen for my development device, I very much doubt that its a problem with my code, and am guessing it is some complex interplay between iTunes Connect, provisioning profiles, Game Centers settings and history on the device, etc.p  pGame Center is enabled in our App ID and in iTunes Connect and App IDs for both match.p  pHelpp  h1Edith1  pMy problem emmayem be similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4576032iosdevelopmentstrangeproblemwithauthenticatinggamecenteruseriOS Development Strange problem with authenticating Game Center usera. The solution proposed for that question was to sign in manually in the Game Center app. This seems like a sensible solution, but I need to log in to the sandbox environment, and I cant find a way to get a sandbox Game Center login prompt in the Game Center app.p

Negative 2494 pim trying to populate a database table access with the Microsoft Access Output step, but I get very bad performance.

Negative 2494 pIm working on an application that interfaces with SharePoint 2010, and one of the SP objects codeSPFolder.Subfolders[index]code if youre curious requires a string to index the items it returns. The problem is that I need to pass it a string variable, but it only accepts literals. Is there a way to convert the variable to a literal for this purpose If the question isnt clear enough, see the illustration belowp  precodeSPFolder folder  rootFolder.SubFolders[Literal folder name]   This properly searches the collection which has already been defined and returns the folder with the name specified by the literal.  string newFolder  Literal folder name   In this case Im trying to pass this string as the index. SPFolder folder  rootFolder.SubFolders[newFolder]   This is where it throws a Value does not fall within the expected range exception when the string is referenced. codepre  pIf context helps, the application is taking an array of folder names and creating them at a specific level in a library, then looping through the new folders to build a complex folder structure within them. To do this, I have to create a folder, fetch its url, then create the rest of the folders based on that url. Fetching the newly created folder is where Im running into trouble, because indexing the parent folder with the string I just used to create it is where it gets mad.p

Negative 2494 pI have a problem with a WPF app that is run from Windows machines and use a webservice located on an Apache server. The Windowscomputers are members of an AD domain, and the Apache webservice requires AD authentication.p  pThe webservice is accessed by WCF. As expected it first attempts to fetch the URL webservice, gets a 401 Unauthorized then tries again with auth Windows auth or NTLM auth. With auth it succeeds and everything is fine.p  pThe HTTP connection is KeepAlive, and 100 expect continue is enabled but same result without. The header is plain vanilla, and contains ContentLength i.e. 50kb as expected.p  pThe problem is that in some cases Apache2 will read emonly the headerem portion and then return the 401 response. The client, unaware that Apache decided to end it all, continues sending the content xml. Since this is a keepalive Apache2 is at this point expecting next request, but instead receives body from first request XML and responds with Bad Request. When WCF sees this response it stops and doesnt resend request with auth header. The Apache log file confirms this as it logs the XML as a bad request where it normally logs the GET, and Wireshark on the client confirms this as I see two HTTP responses from Apache within the one request from the client.p  pSince the client has added ContentLength 54102 in the middle of the header Id say this is the server that is buggy note this all happens before any custom code in Apache is executed. The server must expect the content to follow as specified, every HTTP client in the world cant take a max latency break waiting for the server to maybe send a header response to the header.p  pSo the way I see it this problem have two solutinsp  ol liFix Apache.li liMake WCF authenticate on first request.li ol  p1 is a server issue better suited for serverfault.br  2 can be done in C code, but from my Googleresearch it seems people are able to do this with basic auth when you can ask the user for userpass. I however need it as WindowsNTLM auth.p  pSo, my question How can I have WCF WindowsNTLM authenticate on first requestbr  Any other thoughtsinfo around this problem is also welcome.p

Negative 2494 pIm new to ObjectiveC and iOS programming. Ive read through a few of Apples Getting Started docs and Ive downloaded a few sample applications to try and get familiar with what is going on in the app. What Im confused about is what exactly happens from the applications launch. I see in main.m that UIApplicationMain gets called and invokes the AppDelegate. From what Ive read, now, if applicationDidFinishLaunching returns true, the app will enter the main event loop.p  pIs this all correct If so, how do I tie my code to events Where do I create instances of my classes when an event occursp  pFinally, from my understanding, Xcode now creates all template apps with storyboards. However, some applications I am looking at are a bit older and dont use storyboards, but I dont see .xib or .nib files anywhere in the directory, but the applications successfully build. Am I wrong in assuming that applications require these filesp

Negative 2494 pIm old users of Beckhoff technologies, especially TwinCAT. At the moment, we are suffering a transformation of our PLC architectures due to the new functionality that are bring by TwinCAT 3 Object Orientedp  pAt the moment we are developing our new PLC architecture and we are having several concerns about how to go forward. One very good example that is pretty much taking our attention at the moment is the new Methods and the overall differences with the Actions.p  pFrom my own point of view Methods are created not just in order to define and implement interfaces but also as a way to simplify the FunctionBlocks and their internal state machine. For example, if I have a FBConveyor which has its own state machine inside I could select to create and internal METHOD MINIT for the conveyor which will inspect the conveyor in order to check if there is any products when conveyor it is in INIT state, checking the Method output value. MEthod will contain its won state machine and will not be ready until its output returns TRUE value.p  pThe first concern comes here, as some of our realtime programmers opinion is that methods are not done for this, that in this cases we should implement FBINIT which is called from the FBCONVEYOR and it contains its own variables, so both have a REF to FBMOTOR. p  pThe principal argument is that METHODS are a tool in order to create interfaces and control FBs,  so for example that my own FBCONVEYOR could have been extended from a IConveyor which has a method MTakeIn, but NOT for implementing internal functionality as initializing it.p  pOne argument is also that Methods use its own  stack variables, so all data of a method are temporary and only valid during the execution time. This means that if methods goes too big by the one implementing it we will not be able to ensure correct latency on the realtime. Then on my own experience TC will always take as much resources of processor to ensure the correct cycletime, so using internal stack variable is not actually an architectural mistake, but it is ok and desirable because actually TC ensure real time operation but doesnt need to be implemented as a total realtime C based real time process.p  pDiscussion has been going on, and it is very interested how different opinions are coming to place regarding the fact if Methods should be used or not as an internal operation or should we actually follow the architecture of TC2 Motion FBs, where different function block control different functionality and each one share a REFerence to certain Axis FBMOVE, FBHOME, etcp  pHavent found any real answer to this in any documents, Methods are pretty much always mentioned in case of defining interfaces but never in case of programming internal FB functionality.p  pSo, is it ok to use Methods for internal functionality, this will help in the future when converting the hole FB in an interface for which the method init would need to be re implemented depending of the case.p  pThis question is pretty much the same for new versions of CodeSyS which are also having methods and interfaces.p

Negative 2494 pI have a program that requires that I start from word N, hash the next NM words concatenated and done through another function so the original pointer is not moved, and then increment the FILE pointer that is pointing at N to the emnextem word. p  pThe only way I thought to do this was to increment the FILE pointer until a space is found, then increment further until we found the first character of the next word. This is necessary because the file I am reading may have multiple spaces between words which would not result in a matching string compared to a file that has the same word content but single spaces. p  pThis method would then require codeungetccode because we we would have taken from the stream the first character of the next word. p  pAny ideas on a different implementation or am I pretty well restricted to this methodp  precode    while  c  fgetcfileToHash                  while c  fgetcfileToHash                 ungetcc, fileToHash  codepre

codepre  pNotes on intended outcome  For every row in the collection, the query should create 2 relations codei1[PMI]gti2code and codei2[PMI]gti1code. The weight of the code[PMI]code relations is the math in the codeLogcode function. The graph is codeIngredientcode and codeRecipecode nodes. This query will create a relationship between codei1Ingredientcode and every codei2Ingredientcode that occurs in the recipe containing codei1code.

Negative 2494 pIm reading about how to version symbols in an ELF shared library using GCCs ld version scripts, and I know that it is possible to export differing versions of the same symbol with a directive likep  precodeasm.symver originalfoo,fooVERS1.1 codepre  pWhich is useful if the semantics of the function change, but the library should still export the old version so that old applications using the library can still work with a newer version.p  pBut for a C library, the symbol codevtable for MyClasscode will be exported. If I later change the class by adding more virtual functions, how would I export the original class that includes the original vtable symbol in addition to the newly versioned vtablep  pEDIT I made a test case that seems to work by renaming all symbols of one class to those of another. This seems to work as I had hoped, but is it guaranteed to work or did I just get lucky The code is belowp  pEDIT2 I changed the names of the classes to hopefully be less confusing, and split the definitions into 2 files.p  pEDIT3 It appears to work fine with clang also. I will clarify the overall question that I am askingp  pstrongDoes this technique ensure binary backwardscompatibility for classes in a C shared library on Linux regardless of differences in virtual functions and if not, why not a counterexample would be great.strongp  plibtest.hp  precodestruct Test      virtual void f1     virtual void doNewThing     virtual void f2     virtual void doThing     virtual void f3     virtual Test  codepre  plibtestold.hp  precode This header would have been libtest.h when test0 was theoretically developed.  struct Test      virtual void f3     virtual void f1     virtual void doThing     virtual void f2     virtual Test  codepre  plibtest.cppp  precodeinclude libtest.h include ltcstdiogt  struct OldTest      virtual void f3     virtual void f1     virtual void doThing     virtual void f2     virtual OldTest   asm.symver ZN7OldTestD1Ev,ZN4TestD1EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN7OldTestD0Ev,ZN4TestD0EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN7OldTest7doThingEv,ZN4Test7doThingEvLIB0 asm.symver ZN7OldTestD2Ev,ZN4TestD2EvLIB0 asm.symver ZTI7OldTest,ZTI4TestLIB0 asm.symver ZTV7OldTest,ZTV4TestLIB0 asm.symver ZN7OldTest2f1Ev,ZN4Test2f1EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN7OldTest2f2Ev,ZN4Test2f2EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN7OldTest2f3Ev,ZN4Test2f3EvLIB0  void OldTestdoThing     putsOldTest doThing  void OldTestf1     putsOldTest f1  void OldTestf2     putsOldTest f2  void OldTestf3     putsOldTest f3  OldTestOldTest    void TestdoThing     putsNew Test doThing from Lib1  void Testf1     putsNew f1  void Testf2     putsNew f2  void Testf3     putsNew f3  void TestdoNewThing     putsTest doNewThing, this wasnt in LIB0  TestTest   codepre  plibtest.mapp  precodeLIB0  global     extern C          TestdoThing         Testf         TestTest         TestTest         typeinfoforTest         vtableforTest      local     extern C          OldTest         OldTest        LIB1  global     extern C          TestdoThing         TestdoNewThing         Testf         TestTest         TestTest         typeinfoforTest         vtableforTest       LIB0 codepre  pMakefilep  precodeall libtest.so.0 test0 test1  libtest.so.0 libtest.cpp libtest.h libtest.map     g fPIC Wl,s Wl,versionscriptlibtest.map libtest.cpp shared Wl,soname,libtest.so.0 o libtest.so.0  test0 test0.cpp libtest.so.0     g test0.cpp o test0 .libtest.so.0  test1 test1.cpp libtest.so.0     g test1.cpp o test1 .libtest.so.0 codepre  ptest0.cppp  precodeinclude libtestold.h include ltcstdiogt   in a realworld scenario, these symvers would not be present and this file  would include libtest.h which would be what libtestold.h is now.  asm.symver ZN4TestD1Ev,ZN4TestD1EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN4TestD0Ev,ZN4TestD0EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN4Test7doThingEv,ZN4Test7doThingEvLIB0 asm.symver ZN4Test2f1Ev,ZN4Test2f1EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN4Test2f2Ev,ZN4Test2f2EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN4Test2f3Ev,ZN4Test2f3EvLIB0 asm.symver ZN4TestD2Ev,ZN4TestD2EvLIB0 asm.symver ZTI4Test,ZTI4TestLIB0 asm.symver ZTV4Test,ZTV4TestLIB0  struct MyClass  public Test      virtual void test         putsOld Test func          virtual void doThing         TestdoThing         putsOverride of Old TestdoThing        int mainvoid     MyClass mc  new MyClass      mcgtf1     mcgtf2     mcgtf3     mcgtdoThing     mcgttest      delete mc      return 0  codepre  ptest1.cppp  precodeinclude libtest.h include ltcstdiogt  struct MyClass  public Test      virtual void doThing         TestdoThing         putsOverride of New TestdoThing          virtual void test         putsNew Test func        int mainvoid     MyClass mc  new MyClass      mcgtf1     mcgtf2     mcgtf3     mcgtdoThing     mcgtdoNewThing     mcgttest      delete mc      return 0  codepre

Negative 2494 pI would like to know if its possible to have gob encoded data directly in the source code e.g. in a function. The reason is to increase performance by not having to access the disk to get the gob file. Im aware of memcached, redis and friends. i dont need TTL or any other fancy feature. Just maps in memory. The data would be  encoded and dumped in the source code in a setupbuild process so that at runtime it would only need to decode it. p  pThe go application would basically serve as a small readonly, embedded database. I can do this using json basically declare a var with the raw json but I guess there would be a performance penalty so Im wondering if its possible with gob.p  pIve tried different things but I cant make make it work because basically I dont know how to define the gob var byte, [bytes]   and the decoder seems to expect an io.Reader so before spending the whole day on this Ive decided to ask you SO fellas at least if its possible to do.p  pMiserable attemptp  precodevar test string test  hello  p  newbytes.Buffer e  gob.NewEncoderp e.Encodetest ers  ioutil.WriteFiletest.gob, p.Bytes, 0600 if ers  nil      panicers  codepre  pNow I would like to take test.gob and add it in a function.

Negative 2494 pI want to return in the same row the results of a particular measure on different time range.  For instance Last 30 days, Last 7 days, Last 3 days.

Negative 2494 pIm trying to rotate a rectangle based on the position of the mouse inside or outside of the circle.p  pThe way I see it, if I can determine the point on the circle that is closest to the position of the mouse, I can then transform the rectangle along the circle using that point as the target.p  pI cannot however, figure out how to find that position. I thought that perhaps by using ymxb to follow the line from the mouse pos until it hits the point on the circle.p  pThe problem with this however is that I do not have all of the points on the circle and there are hundreds if not thousands of points on the circle.p  pIf the mouse position is outside of a circle, how do I find the point on the circle closest to the mousepositionp
Negative 2494 pI have a data model with these three tables, codeProjectcode, codeTeamcode amp codeUsercode. When the user creates a new project It should be possible to select which team the new project should be associated with. Im planning to do this with radio buttons. p  pIve got a working implementation, but Im doubting if this is the right way to do it. Mainly from a security standpoint. It currently looks like this I use HAMLp  precode View  formfor project do f       Select team     .formgroup          currentuser.teams.each do team          I use teamid as the value for my radio button          f.radiobutton teamid, team.id  [...]    Controller def new   project  Project.newteamid params[teamid] end  def create   project  Project.newprojectparams   [...]   Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through. def projectparams   params.requireproject.permitname, ideadescription, teamid       end codepre  pIm not sure if it is secure to allow passing codeteamidcode from the view, will it be possible to create an association to any teamp  pSo my question is, is there another way to do it If not, is this implementation OK Or how can I make it more securep

Before performing an action, let say Add New User I want to check if the user performing the action, has the necessary access level based on different rules such as Role, Action Type, if they belong to the same account, etc.p  pI put together a quick example of how the current code sort of looks.p  precodepublic interface IUserService      void AddUser newUser     void Method1     void Method2     etc   public interface IAccountService      void CreateAccount newAccount     void Method1     void Method2     etc   public interface IUserAccessService      bool CanPerformActionint requesterId, otherparameters   public class UserService      private readonly IUserAccessService userAccessService      public UserServiceIUserAccessService userAccessService              userAccessService  userAccessService           public void AddUser newUser              if userAccessService.CanPerformActionxxx             throw         AddUser...           public void Method1              if userAccessService.CanPerformActionxxx             throw         DoSomething...           public void Method2               do not check if user can perform action         DoSomething...       codepre  pI am looking for a way to make sure, whoever implements the interface, that doesnt forget to check for permissions. As you can see in the code above, Add and Method1 do require this check but Method2 doesnt.p  pI was thinking of using the template design pattern in order to accomplish this see below, however, it doesnt look like this is the best approach. p  precodepublic abstract class UserServiceBase      public abstract void AddUser newUser     public abstract void Method1     public abstract void Method2     public abstract bool CanPerformActionint requesterId, otherparameters     etc      public void AddTemplateMethodUser newUser              if CanPerformActionnewUser.Id, otherparamters                throw         AddnewUser           public void Method1TemplateMethod              if CanPerformActionsomeparameters                throw         Method1         public abstract class UserService  UserServiceBase      public override void AddUser newUser              Add User...           public override void Method1              Do something...           public override void Method2              Do something...       codepre  pWith the code above, at least we would check if the user can perform the action or not,  but like I say, it doesnt seem to me like the best way to do it.p  pIn case it helps, I am using autofac as my IoC and I am using C .net 4.5.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciate it. p  pThank you in advance.p  pPS. I am not sure I explained myself very well, please let me know if you need further information or clarification.p

Negative 2494 pI have been using BOOST Test Library to perform unit test on different platforms such as Windows, Linux and MAC. But on IOS, if I still use the same unit test suite that have been used on Windows, Linux and MAC, it will fail. If I understand well about IOS, it is impossible to build an executable command line program that can run on IOS. While the unit test program that can run on Windows, Linux and MAC is a command line program. Moreover, the way how IOS handles the path is very different. I understand on IOS, people often xctest to perform the testing. I just wondering whether it is still possible to use BOOST Test library for unit test on IOS with xcode 4.

Negative 2494 pI am using python 2.7 with Selenium webdriver for Firefox and I have a problem I cant solve or find solved on the internet. My task is to open around 10k web pages adsl router web interfaces  via ip address and upload new firmware. I wrote the code but in order to finish it I must learn how to make selenium webdriver not to wait for page load like forever, but to wait for 2 minutesit is time needed for new firmware to upload and then proceed to next step. I thought I let it wait for forever wait for router to reconnect  much slower but doable by me without help but the catch is when I click upload button it takes 2 minutes of uploading new firmware, then router reboots to apply changes takes less then 2 minutes, then tries to connect around 10 seconds and even then if it gets some other IP it will never load and my program wait for forever. So, I want to skip all of that and I want program to proceed to next router after first 2 minutes. Can it be done I read something about pageLoadingStrategy but I couldnt understand how to use it. Please write me if it is not understandable, because English is not my native language.

But when I try to launch the app, it gets stuck in an eternal wait state.p  pI am not sure, but I suspect my locally built app tries to initialize a hardware component on the board and then gets blocked there.p  pIve been reading articles all over, and seems like it has something to do with the app signing and certificate.

Negative 2494 pI am writing a subclass of UIScrollView right now, and as part of what I am doing I need a second scrollView to contain all of the subviews. p  pThe reason for this is that the second scrollview will have an actual content size, while the subclass scrollview will have a larger content size, and in the scrollViewDidScroll I change the second scrollViews content offset based on the actual content offset.p  pWhen the user adds a subview to the scrollView, it will actually add it to the second scrollView.p  pOne problem that I originally encountered was that the UIScrollView class adds two views to the scrollView the scroll indicators and I want to leave those be.p  pA workaround that I found, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1451342objectivecfindcallerofmethodwhich is the top answer herea with modifications, that works for what I want is to get the name of the sender class in the addSubview method like the followingp  precodeNSString sourceString  [[NSThread callStackSymbols] objectAtIndex1]  Example 1   UIKit                               0x00540c89 [UIApplication callInitializationDelegatesForURLpayloadsuspended]  1163 NSCharacterSet separatorSet  [NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString [].,] NSMutableArray array  [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray[sourceString  componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSetseparatorSet]] [array removeObject] if [[array objectAtIndex3] isEqualToStringltredactedgt]      My code here  else      [super addSubviewview]  codepre  pAlthough this code block works and I am getting the results that I want, it seems kind of hacky, and requires checking if the calling class is , which I would assume means that it doesnt want me to see its name. I am worried that using this method would cause problems if anything is changed in the future or if some other class has the value p  pBasically my question is also TLDR Is there a better way or more reliable to check if the view being added in addSubview is being added by the superclass or even by selfp

Negative 2494 pI have a parent page which has link to pop up. When I pick the values from pop up and hit Ok button inbr pop up, those values are retrieved and placed in parent page text box controls and with in a span of second the page is refreshed automatically and values are reset. I already placed return false at the end of Javascript function that displays the popup.  I placed break points and everything looks fine return false statement is hit. The parent page button has onclick attribute added in Pageload function of code behind. To know whats happening, I added the window.onbeforeunload function at the end after body tag ends. This displays a pop up which asks whether to stay or leave the page.

Negative 2494 pThe project Im working on has 2 main branches, develop and master. I had set up a pull request for my feature branch but by mistake forgot to choose develop as the base, and so the PR was for master as its default going to change that.p  pThe PR was actually merged into master as the assigned person either didnt realise or thought it was right. Then my branch was deleted and the PR closed.p  pA little while later I had realised the mistake that it went into the wrong branch. When I looked at the original PR I noticed a revert button. So after some reading and speaking to another person we did the revert which makes one new commit and a new PR undoing all the commits made by the original PR. p  pThat was then merged in and everything was back to normal. As before the mistake merge.p  pI restored my original feature branch and made a new PR for develop as originally intended. However just out of curiosity I choose master to see what Github says. Github said that I could not compare or merge as master contains all the commits as my feature branch.p  pSo my question is. When the time is right, how would I get my changes into master if i wanted to merge directly in next week or sop  pOr, this is what Im confused about more, when my feature goes into develop as intended, what is going to happen  how is it going to work when the time comes to merge develop into masterp  pRemember, master has all the commits of the feature branch followed straight after with a single commit from a temp branch which reversed all the previous merges changes.p

A simple step would be to use a better identifying tokenp  precodeLoaded asset FE12ABCD Replaced 1000DEEE with 3EF088AD codepre  pWhich already reduces the length of each token   is not used anywhere else so it is reasonable.p  pHowever, what other options are there to make that 32 bit value even smaller I cant use an index  it has to be a full 32 bit value because in some cases the generator of the string has the hash and sometimes it has a string it will hash immediately.p
Negative 2494 pIm trying to make a simple authentication page using Node with Express framework. p  pAt this moment, Im not particularly worried about the weak protection.p  pHowever, my route file is displaying weird behavior. p  pHere is the codep  precodevar express  requireexpress var router  express.Router var admin  require..controllersadmin  router.get, functionreq, res    console.logEntered top route.   ifreq.body.isAuthenticated      res.redirectadminindex    else      res.redirectadminlogin      router.postauthenticate, functionreq,res      ifreq.body.pword  key          console.logResetting body.isAuthed         req.body.isAuthenticated  true         console.logNew val   req.body.isAuthenticated         res.redirectadminindex      else          console.logFailed login attempt   req.body.pword         res.redirectadminlogin        router.getlogin, admin.login router.getindex, admin.index   module.exports  router codepre  pThe idea is that the route is entered, upon which we hit the top route properly logged by console. This redirects based on whether a req variable is set. This all works properly, and the login Im using jade templating is properly rendered. The login file has a form which calls back to this routing file with adminauthenticate. This also works properly Im able to properly retrieve the input confirmed via console logs. However, the actions I take in the authenticate function, even though they are the exact same thing I do in the  route right above, fail. I get 404s and Express Not Found printouts which are entirely useless.p  pMy console properly logs Failed login attempt or Resetting body...New val true, but then doing the exact same res.redirect that is initially done in the router.get method above fails, whereas the res.redirects in that function properly redirect and render the correct values.p  pAny ideas what could be wrong I could post the admin.loginadmin.index methods in the controllersadmin file. However, theyre very simple and I think this error stems from a basic misunderstanding of the difference between get and post methods or something this is my first time using Node.p  pThanksp

Negative 2494 pAlright i have working code that removes a selected rows via a checkbox being checked. However i am running into the issue of enforcing that only one of the radio buttons can be checked at any given moment. My first approach is to tie a click event to the each radio button and if it gets clicked, it loops through the observable array and marks all false. Then it simply flips the flag to true for the item that fired the event.

Negative 2494 pThere are a lot of articles about some specific problem using DllImport. Alas quite often I see different replies to the same question.

It is async and called each time a button is tapped My goal is to make it forget the last measurement, similar to what happens when I turn location services off.p  precode        async void Tickobject sender, EventArgs e                   Geolocator geolocator  new Geolocator             geolocator.DesiredAccuracy  PositionAccuracy.High             IAsyncOperationltGeopositiongt locationTask  null             try                          if geolocator.LocationStatus  PositionStatus.Disabled                 MessageBox.ShowCannot determine info because location services are turned off.             else                              locationTask  geolocator.GetGeopositionAsyncTimeSpan.FromMinutes1, TimeSpan.FromSeconds15                 Geoposition geoposition  await locationTask                 distances.Children.Addnew TextBlockText  geoposition.Coordinate.Latitude.ToString  ,  geoposition.Coordinate.Longitude.ToString                  updnum  updnum  1                 Numupd.Text  updnum.ToString                               finally                      if locationTask  null                              if locationTask.Status  AsyncStatus.Started                                      locationTask.Cancel                                  locationTask.Close                                    locationTask.Cancel             return             locationTask.Close      codepre

Negative 2494 pI just started out a new job as a c programmer on .net 3.5. My manager gives me total independence on how I build my modules, which is generally a good thing, but there are minuses too. Having too much Freedom tends to make me wonder to places you wouldnt have if you had some strict guidance.p  pMy project involves many simple forms and reports, usually one table for each form, sometimes I have a 1to1 or 1toMany relations on a specific form. Also, my business objects are not complicated for now, every table on the database maps to on exactly strongonestrong business object.p  pSo, I did my research and decided that for my DAL which isnt too complicated Ill be using a LinqtoSql within simple Repositories classes as it provides me with a simple ORM mappings of objects and also in .net 3.5 I felt its my best option, strongyou are more than welcome to correct me if Im wrongstrong.p  pI then decided that Ill be using an MVP pattern to tie up my layers, giving me a well decoupled UIBusiness Logic. Having said all that, theory worked perfect but soon as I started with my first module many questions arise. I dont want to make this question too general so Ill give a real life example and explain my confusions once at a time, trying to keep it as concise as I can.p  pLets say that I have a simple form that needs to present a Person details, and on that form on a button click a subform will popup with that person Children. so I havep  precodeTable Person idPK,name Table Children idPK,name,parent codepre  pCorresponding to those tables I have the following Objects.p  precodepublic class Person       [ColumnIsPrimaryKey  true, IsDbGenerated  true]      public int id  get set       [Column]      public string Name  get set       [Association...]Association Details    public class Children       [ColumnIsPrimaryKey  true, IsDbGenerated  true]      public int id  get set       [Column]      public string Name  get set       [Association...]Association details.   codepre  pTo get Data from my models I have created a class codePersonRepositorycode. This class is in charge of querying the Database and fetch all the data that the codePersonViewcode needs, all done by LinqtoSQL.p  precodepublic class PersonRepository      private readonly MyDatabaseContext db      public PersonRepository              db  new MyDatabaseContext  Using 1 context           public IQueryableltPersongt GetPersonint id             return from p in db.Person where p.id  id select p       codepre  pConfusions on this Repository class.p  ul liHow many of this repositories should I have, for each Table  Entity  Form  set for Forms  is there any convention on that part li liThe second form needs the Person Children details. Does that means itll get a copy of the same PersonRepository object li liIs it correct to create an strongonlinestrong context that lives throughout the lifetime of the Repository  What are the tradeoffs, when should I use the disconnected approach. li ul  pHere is my PersonPresenter constructorp  precodepublic PersonPresenter  IPersonView view, PersonRepository repo  codepre  pHere is my ChildrenPresenter constructorp  precodepublic ChildrenPresenter  IChildrenView view, PersonRepository repo  codepre  pAs you can see Im using same PersonRepository on the ChildrenPresenter. p  pHere are more thoughts.p  ul liIn simple cases like this should I just use one presenter for both forms  or its better to have one Presenter per form li liWhat if a form suddenly introduces a new Entity data to be taken from another table which belongs on a different Repository  what should I do then to get that data  As I said at the moment I dont have this case but I just wonder.li liLets say that now I have a report that needs the Person and Children data, should it too use the same PersonRepository which means that from now on its the central Repository for a Person li ul  pAs you can see, I am pretty much bedazzled by all the paths I can take. I know that its all a matter of experience and time but I do want to accelerate my knowledge. I know that my Repository can implement some interfaces too and that there are Transaction to be considered. I know its too much to ask and Id really appreciate offers of good reads on those subjects cant be answered here.p  pThanksp

Negative 2494 pIm encountering an interesting phenomena with Swift 1.2 and Xcode.  My familiarity with the language and library innerworkings are not sufficient to understand why this happens.  Perhaps someone can explain.  Consider the following code blockp  precodestatic func hideSpinnerspinnerViewParent UIViewController       for thissubview in spinnerViewParent.view.subviews              if thissubview is SpinnerView               UIView.animateWithDuration0.25, animations thissubview as SpinnerView.alpha  0.0, completion completed in thissubview.removeFromSuperview              break if you break, it will subvert and hijack the completion closure                codepre  pSpinnerView is a simple subclass of a UIView which throws a spinner on screen to alert the user that the app is thinking.  The hideSpinner function fades the SpinnerView out, and then removes it from the parent view.p  pThe problem is, if you leave the break in, the completion block of the animateWithDuration call will not execute properly.p  pIf you comment out the break, it works as intended.p  pWhy  Does breaking the loop somehow subvert and orphan the closure callback  Why does removing the break make it work as intendedp

How can I do thatp  p The codewillTransitioncode hook for the codeprofilelist.profilecode route doesnt fire before transitioning to codeprofilelist.profile.assessmentcode, so I can not pause it, print the template and relaunch the transition.p  p I thought I would be able to use the codeafterModelcode hook as described in the docs, to interrupt the transition and retry it after having fetched the child modelp  precodeprofileindexprofilecontroller.js afterModel functionmodel, transition    if assessmentmodelisfetched      return true      else      transition.aborttransition to profileindex.profile.assessment interrupted, nothing renders     fetchassessmentmodel.thenfunctionres       transition.retrytransition to profileindex.profile.assessment retried, the whole transition including profileindex.profile starts again       return true          codepre  pBut in that case the transition stops completely, nothing is displayed, and the whole transition is then run again once the promise resolves this is not better than a standard transition with a codebeforeModelcode promise hook on children.p  p I can not redirect to a codeprofileindex.profile.indexcode route in the codeafterModelcode hook, as there is no such route the nested children routes with the same url probably prevent the creation of the index route.p  p I may be able to use routes with different urls for the codeassessmentcode and codequestionnairecode say codeprofiles1previewassessmentcode, and use the redirect hook of the codeprofileindex.profilecode route to pause then transition to codeprofileindex.profile.assessmentcode, but then my url would change from codeprofiles1previewcode to codeprofiles1previewassessmentcode and then codeprofiles1previewassessmentquestionnairecode which is ugly. How can I transition to a route without changing the urlp  pThank you.p  pstrongeditstrongp  pI managed to add a codeprofilelist.profile.loadingcode route sibling of codeprofilelist.profile.assessmentcode, which basically does nothing except display a loader in a separate part of the page. I had to assign an url to it codeloadingcode in order to differentiate it from codeprofilelist.profile.assessmentcode. Once the codefetchassessmentmodelcode promise renders, I can transition from the loading route to the aborted transition using codereplaceWithcode to remove the page history entry codeprofiles1previewloadingcodep  precodeprofileindexprofilecontroller.js afterModel functionmodel, transition    var selfthis   if assessmentmodelisfetched      return true      else      self.transitionToself.routeName.loading     fetchassessmentmodel.thenfunctionres       self.replaceWithtransition.targetName,model       return true          codepre  pThis is not too bad except if feels indirect, Im prefetching the model for assessment in the profile route and the codeloadingcode url is quite ugly. If anyone has a better Idea of how to solve it the Ember way I will be glad. Bonus points for someone able to tell me how I will be able to reconcile this project structure with Ember 2.0 where Im not sure I will be able to reuse routed components the way Im able to do now with controllers.p

Negative 2494 pMy project is MyLib, a library that builds into a JAR artifact, codemylib1.0.0.jarcode.p  pThe a hrefhttpsmaven.apache.orgpluginsmavenshadeplugin relnofollowMaven Shade plugina lets me pull one or more of my MyLibs dependencies into the built artifact, codemylib1.0.0.jarcode, generating a socalled uberJAR.

Negative 2494 pIm working on a chat interface at the moment and currently have the viewport height to 100vh, with a headernavbar, a main content section, and the footer where the input field is located  see fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2L8q3r5h15 relnofollowhereap  pThe way I have it currently coded has the main section receive content from the AJAX calls made via the input field in the footer.

Negative 2494 pI have a bit of a unique problem here. I currently have two warehouses that I ship items out of for selling on Amazon, my primary warehouse and my secondary warehouse. Shipping out of the secondary warehouse takes significantly longer than shipping from the main warehouse, hence why it is referred to as the secondary warehouse.p  pSome of our inventory is split between the two warehouses. Usually this is not an issue, but we keep having a particular issue. Allow me to explainp  pLets say that I have 10 red cups in the main warehouse, and an additional 300 in the secondary warehouse. Lets also say its Christmas time, so I have all 310 listed. However, from what Ive seen, Amazon only allows one shipping time to be listed for the inventory, so the entire 310 get listed as under the primary warehouses shipping time 2 days and doesnt account for the secondary warehouses ship time, rather than split the way that they should be, 10 at 2 days and 300 at 15 days. p  pThe problem comes in when someone orders an amount that would have to be split across the two warehouses, such as if someone were to order 12 of said red cups. The first 10 would come out of the primary warehouse, and the remaining two would come out of the secondary warehouse. Due to the secondary warehouses shipping time, the remaining two cups would have to be shipped out at a significantly different date, but Amazon marks the entire order as needing to be shipped within those two days. p  pFor a variety of reasons, it is not practical to keep all of one product in one warehouse, nor is it practical to increase the secondary warehouses shipping time. Changing the overall shipping date for the product to the longest ship time causes us to lose the buy box for the listing, which really defeats the purpose of us trying to sell it.p  pSo my question is this is there some way in MWS to indicate that the inventory is split up in terms of shipping times If so, howp  pAny assistance in this matter would be appreciated.p

Negative 2494 pIn the programming of my 2d sandbox game, I decided to add a procedural generation engine to generate terrain. The way I have decided to implement it is by using the diamond square algorithm to generate values, then based on the values I will derive the matching terrain each terrain has a range where it can generate. The only example I could find for the algorithm found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2755750diamondsquarealgorithmherea requires an odd grid size i.e. 17 x 17, not 16 x 16 to generate. I understand why and was wondering if I should use a different algorithm, or if there was a way to make it work with this algorithm.p

Negative 2494 pI would like to transfer data from sheet1 to sheet2 as indicated in the below pictures. I thought it best to use an codeifcode statement.

Negative 2494 pI was wondering if someone knows a library for Swift to let users draw a vector on an image and replace the color within the vector so the color is realistically applied to the image.p  pFor example a user loads an image and it is than given the ability to draw a sort of vector shape by tapping on the image. Lets assume the user loads an image of a car and points out the door of the car.p  pThan the user can chose the color that should be applied to the car door.p  pAnyone know how to do this or where to startp  pI assume the difficulty is   Manipulating the image If the car door is red and the selected color is blue, the transparent overlay in combination with the car door color will result in purple instead of blue.   Saving the image in original resolution with the applied changes. p  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 2494 pMy Windows 7 installation is on the C drive. I have a folder on my D drive that contains many scripts that I use frequently and that is backed up in case my computer crashes. I took the habit of creating codeSYMLINKcodes in the codeAPPDATAMicrosoftWindowsSendTocode folder pointing to some of my scripts and this would create useful shortcuts in the codeSendTocode menu.

As a work around, I removed the codeSYMLINKcodes and copied the actual files instead but I find this annoying since I hate having multiple copies of the same file on my computer.

The path can only move east and only to neighbors of itself i.e. you could not jump from 2 to 4 because 4 is more than one unit away.p  pMy question is what methods can I find and store every possible path on a user given grid knowing its dimensions Is it conducive to store the entire grid in a 2D array of codeint[rows][cols]code or codeint[cols][rows]code I assume this would be done most simply in a recursive way.p  pI know there are similar questions but I was unable to formulate a working solution from them. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p
