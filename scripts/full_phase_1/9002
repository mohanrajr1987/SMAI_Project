Positive 9002 pI have a picturebox in my system that displays a thumbnail image from a codeListltBitmapgtcode called codeimagescode. There is a button on either side of the picturebox that allows the user to move to the previous or next image. What I would like to happen is that when the picturebox is on the first image of the List, then the previous button is disabled, and same for the last image and the next button. At any other time, the user should be able to scroll in either direction.  I have written a function called codecheckFirstLastcode to try and implement this, and am testing it with only two elements in the codeimagescode List. The function is shown below, and is called every time the image on the picturebox is changedp  precode    Bitmap passed in represents image currently displayed on picbox     public void checkFirstLastBitmap displayImage              if displayImage  images.First                      cant go back             set prev button as inactive             btnPrevImage.Enabled  false             btnPrevImage.BackColor  INACTIVECOLOUR              can go forward             set next button as active             btnNextImage.Enabled  true             btnNextImage.BackColor  ACTIVECOLOUR                  else if displayImage  images.Last                      can go back             set prev button as active             btnPrevImage.Enabled  true             btnPrevImage.BackColor  ACTIVECOLOUR              cant go forward             set next button as inactive             btnNextImage.Enabled  false             btnNextImage.BackColor  INACTIVECOLOUR                  else                      can go back             set prev button as active             btnPrevImage.Enabled  true             btnPrevImage.BackColor  ACTIVECOLOUR              can go forward             set next button as active             btnNextImage.Enabled  true             btnNextImage.BackColor  ACTIVECOLOUR               codepre  pWhen the application loads, it loads to the first element in the codeimagescode, and the codecheckFirstLastcode function is run. This means that at this point, the previous button is disabled while the next button is enabled. However, when the next button is clicked codecheckFirstLastcode run again and the picturebox shows the second last element in codeimagescode, neither button changes enabled state as it should. This means that the system becomes stuck on the last element in the List and can go neither backwards button not enabled, nor forwards no more images, although button stays enabled.p  pI dont really understand what could be going wrong, surely if the function operates as expected first time around then it cant just not work when called again Not sure where to go from here, any advice or a point in the direction of where to look would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks in Advance, Markp

If a button is pressed, the appropriate direction is filed and the screen resets hide buttons and show default text ready for the next swipe.  If a swipe is recorded, no buttons are pressed and a new swipe is made within 5 seconds, the previous swipe is files with an indeterminate direction and the new swipe options are displayed.p  pAll of this seems to be working apart from the reset of the screen after the 5 second timeout.

Positive 9002 pI would like to be notified of the button power being pressed on Android. To be clear, I am not looking to override the power button event, but simply being notified of when it has happened. From everything Ive researched so far, there is no such thing in Android. Please let me know if there is, or if there is one planned for Androids near future.p  pUntil now, I have been using screen onoff broadcasts in order to essentially guess that the power button has been pressed. However, since KK Watch API 20 or Lollipop API 21, even this, is no longer accurate. This is because although the broadcast is still named ACTIONSCREENON , they no longer refer to when the screen turned on but instead when the device became interactive, which can be delayed compared to when the screen actually came on. The same is true for ACTIONSCREENOFF, it actually refers to when the device is no longer in interactive mode, not exactly when the screen turned off. p  pThe Display class has some different display states which do actually refer to the screen state STATEOFF, STATEON, STATEDOZE, STATEDOZESUSPEND, or STATEUNKNOWN. You can get the display state with getState but theres no sort of broadcast system to notify that the state has changed, as far as I know.p  pDoes anyone know a way to get more accurately notified of the power button being pressed or the screen changing state If it comes down to it, I wouldnt mind a root solution either.p

Positive 9002 pWe are having an aspx website that has the form fields with the submit button, the postback for the site used to happen normally, all of a sudden we are not able to perform postback in the website. And after clearing the browser cache we are able to perform the postback in the website. p  pThis seems to be strange behavior as temporarily for some of the users on button click only the form reloads and nothing happens. The application seems to behave normally after the browser cache clear, any advice on the same is highly appreciated, as the users do not accept the workaround often.p  pRegards Arvindp

Negative 9002 pI seem to be seeing more for loops over iterators in questions amp answers here than I do foreach, transform, and the like.  Scott Meyers suggests that a hrefhttpwww.ddj.comcpp184401446stl algorithms are preferreda, or at least he did in 2001.  Of course, using them often means moving the loop body into a function or function object.

Negative 9002 pIm considering migrating a project to managed code, but Ive heard that the .NET runtime is hugeseveral times larger than my executable binary, in fact.  That just seems like the tail wagging the dog to me.  But Ive also been told that some CLR implementations, such as Mono, are modular, and you can create a custom distribution for them that only contains the parts you actually need.p  pProblem is, Im having a surprisingly difficult time finding answers on Google to what ought to be very simple questions about this.  How big are the full CLR packages on various implementations, which ones support this modular distribution ability, and how big would the runtime end up being for a standard windowsstyle formbased app that doesnt use tons of .NET bells and whistles  Mostly what Im interested in is the Assembly systems inherent ability to create plugins easily, and the ability to build scripting into my program through JIT compilation.p  pEDIT Im not interested in installer sizes or download times.  I want to know the size of the actual framework, uncompressed and ready to run, as it will be on the endusers systems.p

Negative 9002 pIm supporting some c code on Solaris, and Ive seen something weird at least I think it isp  precodechar newlogin[64] ... strcpynewlogin, char login ... freenewlogin codepre  pMy understanding is that since the variable is a local array the memory comes from the stack and does not need to be freed, and moreover since no malloccallocrealloc was used the behaviour is undefined.p  pThis is a realtime system so I think it is a waste of cycles.  Am I missing something obvious  p

Negative 9002 pIm creating my first web application and Im really confused as to what technology to go for.p  pMy application needs to look serious like an application, it doesnt need many colorful graphical interfaces. It only needs a toolbar, a tab bar, a split panel preferably 3 columns, an easilyformatable text field, and a status bar. It will connect to a MySQL database through PHP unless I go for GWT. Users will upload files.p  pMy evaluation of the optionsp  pstrongFlexstrong Probably the easiest to develop but Im pretty sure my application is something one would use on an iPad and with Flashs future on the iPad still unsure, I dont want to take the risk, otherwise Flex wouldve been my choice.p  pstrongjQuerystrong Ive heard a lot about it and a lot of people recommend but I dont know how easy it is to use and how customizable the look of my app is.p  pstrongGWTstrong The problem with GWT is that it doesnt have many widgets. Another problem is that Im gonna have to host the files in AppEngines datastore and transfer them back and forth to a web server that will do operations on them I need to process them which adds more traffic and slows the process which worsens the user experience.p  pstrongClosurestrong It has a nice toolbar and a nice text field. Im not sure how easy it is to use. Plus, I read a hrefhttpwww.sitepoint.comblogs20091112googleclosurehownottowritejavascript relnofollowan articlea that makes it sound really bad.p  pstrongCappuccinostrong It has a very nice UI and it has a mac feel. Im planning to give my application a mac feel anyway so this will save me a lot of theming. But if I go for this option I wont be able to make use of HTML5s new features especially working offline.p  pstrongPlain JS and HTML5strong This gives me the most flexibility but it is the hardest to work for.p  pIm sorry if this is subjective but I really need help with this.p

Negative 9002 pIm in the midst of porting a win32 app to cocoa. Wherever possible, Im using IB, since... well its way easier in every way possible, obviously. One thing is the designer and the win32 dev set up all the button assets on a massive sprite sheet such you move around the viewport to determine button state. Similar to how yahoo does CSS sprites on their home page a hrefhttpd.yimg.comaiwwmetpaicons20100309sprappsus.png relnofollowhttpd.yimg.comaiwwmetpaicons20100309sprappsus.pngap  pCan IB be setup to handle this type sprite strip with the default buttons, or are we SOL on this one I can certainly fire something up programmatically that would do this, but would like to incorporate as much of the default button behavior and selector hookup in IB.p  pThoughtsp  pJoshp
Negative 9002 pI am calling the webservices. The web service returns data in xml format. Now the problem is the xml data is not being received in proper format. In place of lt,  it returns in html form . So i assigned the xmldata to a NsMutableString and replaced the escape characters so that the format of xml data is proper. Then i reassigned the NSMutableString to NSData so that i can parse the tags. but the problem is the xmlparser stops right where the xml data is. Where i replaced the tags. it doesnt go further. can anybody make me understand what is going on  p  pThis is the xml response from webservice that i called.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingISO88591gtltSOAPENVEnvelope xmlnsSOAPENVhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnsSOAPENChttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapencodinggt ltSOAPENVBodygt ltns1GetCustomerInfoResponse xmlnsns1httpaa.somewebservice.comphpwebservicegt ltreturn xsitypexsdstringgt     ampltxml versionampquot1.0ampquot encodingampquotutf8ampquotampgtampltcustomerampgtampltidampgt1ampltidampgtampltcustomernameampgtHiteshampltcustomernameampgtampltphonenumberampgt98989898ampltphonenumberampgtampltcustomerampgt ltreturngt ltns1GetCustomerInfoResponsegt ltSOAPENVBodygt ltSOAPENVEnvelopegt codepre  pAnd this is after i replaced the tags.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingISO88591gtltSOAPENVEnvelope xmlnsSOAPENVhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnsSOAPENChttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapencodinggt ltSOAPENVBodygt ltns1GetCustomerInfoResponse xmlnsns1httpaa.somewebservice.comphpwebservicegt ltreturn xsitypexsdstringgt ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt   ltcustomergtltidgt1ltidgtltcustomernamegtHiteshltcustomernamegtltphonenumbergt98989898ltphonenumbergtltcustomergt ltreturngt ltns1GetCustomerInfoResponsegt ltSOAPENVBodygtltSOAPENVEnvelopegt codepre  pNow the problem is while parsing the xml data, the parser only goes upto return tag.

Negative 9002 pRecently I have gone through with one simple threading program, which leads me some issues for the related concepts... My sample program code looks like p  precodeclass NewThread implements Runnable      Thread t     NewThread          t  new Threadthis, Demo Thread         System.out.printlnChild thread   t         t.start  Start the thread          public void run          try              for int i  5 i gt 0 i                  System.out.printlnChild Thread   i                 Thread.sleep500                       catch InterruptedException e              System.out.printlnChild interrupted.

System.out.printlnMain thread exiting.       codepre  pNow this program giving me the output as follows p  precodeChild thread Thread[Demo Thread,5,main] Main Thread 5 Child Thread 5 Child Thread 4 Main Thread 4 Child Thread 3 Child Thread 2 Main Thread 3 Child Thread 1 Exiting child thread. Main Thread 2 Main Thread 1 Main thread exiting. codepre  pSo, thats very much clear to me. But as soon as I am replacing the object creation code calling of a NewThread class constructor to as follows p  precodeNewThread nt  new NewThread  create a new thread codepre  pthe output becomes a bit varied like as follows p  precodeChild thread Thread[Demo Thread,5,main] Main Thread 5 Child Thread 5 Child Thread 4 Child Thread 3 Main Thread 4 Child Thread 2 Child Thread 1 Main Thread 3 Exiting child thread. Main Thread 2 Main Thread 1 Main thread exiting. codepre  pAnd some times its giving me same output in both the cases. So, i am not getting the exact change in both the scenario.p  pI would like to know that you the variation in the output is coming here p  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 9002 pI work on a large C project which makes use of Unity builds.  For those unfamiliar with the practice, Unity builds include multiple related C implementation files into one large translation unit which is then compiled as one.  This saves recompiling headers, reduces link times, improves executable sizeperformance by bring more functions into internal linkage, etc.  Generally good stuff.p  pHowever, I just caught a latent bug in one of our builds.  An implementation file used library without including the associated header file, yet it compiled and ran.  After scratching my head for bit, I realized that it was being included by an implementation file included before this one in our unity build.  No harm done here, but it could have been a perplexing surprise if someone had tried to reuse that file later independently.p  pIs there any way to catch these silent dependencies and still keep the benefits of Unity builds besides periodically building the nonUnity versionp

Negative 9002 pI am trying to get a simple jQuery UI dialog to work in an ASP.Net project. I have some buttons inside the dialogs codeltdivgtcode, but they werent posting back. Upon closer inspection, for whatever reason when making the codeltdivgtcode a panel it moves it in the DOM so that it is the last tag before codeltbodygtcode. This would all be fine and dandy except for it also moves it outside of the codeltformgtcode tag which is needed so that the buttons can do a postback. p  pWhat is the purpose of this behavior and how can I override it p  pAn example is here a hrefhttpjsbin.comolumu4 relnofollowhttpjsbin.comolumu4ap  pLooking at Firebug though I get this img srchttpimg80.imageshack.usimg809049dialog.png altalt textp

Negative 9002 pIm trying to avoid a dynamic type in my lambda expression for grouping a collection. The type is defined anonymously at compile time and unambiguously as far as I can tell.

Negative 9002 pIve got this 1 minute long movie that I want to compile into an AS3 project.  The movie started out in MOV format, so I used FFMpeg to convert it to FLV, then again with FFMpeg from FLV to SWF.p  pIm embedding this movie into the AS3 binary by using codeEmbedcode metadatap  pre [Embedsource1.swf] private var VidClass pre  pIve got a container Sprite that this movie gets added to.  Before its added in, I cast the embedded movie as a MovieClipp  pre var vidObject  new Vid return vid as MovieClip pre  pWhen I add the resulting movie clip to the stage, it begins playing immediately and seems to play fine.  However, when I check the totalFrames property of the movie clip, it returns 0.  And the movie clip doesnt seem to respond to calls to codestopcode or codegotoAndStopcode.p  pI get this same behavior from embedding the movie into an SWF in the Flash IDE then embedding the result in the same manner, so it seems something is out of whack with the way Im adding it to the stage.  Any thoughtsp  pEDIT As a requirement of the product, the as3 movie cannot load the video from an external file.  It must be compiled in, so the resultant .swf that does the playing can operate completely on its own without having to rely on other external files.p  pEDIT 2 Upon further inspection, the MovieClip instance that results fromp  pre [Embedsource1.swf] private var VidClass pre  pre var vidObject  new Vid return vid as MovieClip pre  phas one child object which is of class Loader, and that child has no children.  I tried casting the child directly as MovieClip but to no avail.p  pEDIT 3 From what Im reading a hrefhttpwww.bytearray.orgp1689 relnofollowherea and a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSFlashPlatformbetareferenceactionscript3flashnetNetStream.html relnofollowherea, the 10.1 api for the NetStream object exposes a method called appendBytes.  I still need to look further into this, but I could embed the .flv file as an octet stream and feed the bytes manually to the Net Stream object to play the video.  Ill post the result of my tests in a few...p

Negative 9002 pI have a Magento site in which there are about 2025 extensions installed, among which 7 are commercial, which means that those 7 extensions are fully encrypted.

Using firefox or IE, you can post the comment without any problem whatever wordpress blog it is, but using python and post method directly communicating with a server I got 404 with several blogs. And Ive tried to spoof the headers, adding cookies in the code, but the result remains the same. Its bugging me for quite a while... Anybody knows the reason Or what code should I add to make the program works just like a browser such as firefox or IE etc  Hopefully you guys would help me outp

Negative 9002 pI have a problem whereby I have several discrete lists of IDs eg.p  pList A 1,2,3,4,5,7,8br List B 2,3,4,5br List C 4,2,8,9,1br etc...p  pI then have another collection of IDs...br For example 1,2,4  p  pI need to try and match one into each list. If I can perfectly match all IDs in my secondary collection one collection ID matched with an ID from each list then I get a true result....   p  pI have found that it becomes complicated because if you simply iterate over the lists matching the first collectionlist pair that you encounter it may result in you precluding a possible combination further on down the line hence returning a false negative result.   p  pFor example  p  pList A 1,2,3,4br List B 1,2,3,4br List C 3,4  p  pCollection is 3,1,2  p  pThe first ID from the collection 3 matches with an entry in list A, the second ID in the collection 1 matches an item in list B, however the final ID in the collection 2 DOESNT match any entry in list C however if you rearrange the order of the collection to be 2,1,3 then a match is found.... Therefore I am looking for some form of logic for attempting a match on all possible combinations in an efficient manner  p  pTo make it more complicated the IDs are actually GUIDs so cant just be sorted in ascending orderp  pI hope I have described this well enough to make it clear what I am attempting and with a bit of luck somebody will be able to tell me that what I need to do is very easy and I am missing something real simplebr I am forced to code this in VB6 but any methods or pseudo code would be great. The backend of this is SQL server so if a solution using TSQL was possible this would be even better as all of the IDs are held in tables already.  p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 9002 pI have a case in my application where I need to launch an asynchronous task and then block for it to complete.  Yes, yes, I know that it not optimal, but its an artifact of the libraries were using.p  pSpecifically, I need to call a function and pass a callback object, and the actual callback will occur on a separate thread.  But I want to wait for the callback to occur, essentially building a synchronous mechanism on top of an asynchronous one.p  pSo my code looks something like thisp  precodeprivate static class MethodCallback implements RpcCallbackltMessagegt      private Message message  null     private boolean done  false     private long started  System.currentTimeMillis      public synchronized void runMessage parameter          long elapsed  System.currentTimeMillis  started         log.debugGot callback after  millis, elapsed         this.message  parameter         this.done  true         notifyAll           public synchronized void await throws ServiceException          whiledone ampamp System.currentTimeMillis  started lt MAXWAITMILLIS              try                  long remaining  started  MAXWAITMILLIS  System.currentTimeMillis                 ifremaining lt 0                      remaining  1                                  waitremaining              catchInterruptedException e                  break                               ifdone              String msg  String.formatTimeout No response from async process             log.warnmsg             throw new ServiceExceptionmsg                    public Message get          return message        public Message getMessageFromAsyncProcess      MethodCallback callback  new MethodCallback     channel.doAsyncThingcallback     callback.await     Message result  callback.get     ifresult  null          throw new ServiceExceptionError async process did not produce a result          return result  codepre  pNow, this code works perfectly well, and the application performs acceptably quickly.  But profiling has determined that codeMessageCallback.runcode is a performance bottleneck, presumably due to synchronization. p  pSo as an experiment, I modified the code to use a a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentSynchronousQueue.html relnofollowcodeSynchronousQueuecodea instead, expecting that this would improve the performance.  But to my surprise it made it run about twice as slowly approximately 15ms per call on average versus approximately 7ms per call for the doitthehardway version.p  pI could presumably hack up an alternative mechanism using either a a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentSemaphore.html relnofollowcodeSemaphorecodea or something like a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentatomicAtomicBoolean.html relnofollowcodeAtomicBooleancodea, but should I expect either of those would perform any betterp  pGiven that I only have two threads, and I simply want one of them to wait until the other has produced a single result, is there any mechanism that will be better than what Im doing nowp

Negative 9002 pI have a string variable that contains an HTML table in excel VBA. I know that when this table is stored in the clipboard and I invoke .PasteSpecial, Excel does some nifty preprocessing and fills the cells out in the current sheet the same way as they appear in the table.p  pHowever, if I simply set the .Value of a cellrange to the string variable, no such preprocessing takes place and the entire string, HTML tags and all, are dumped into the cell. I want the former result, but I cannot use the clipboard because it is being used by this application elsewhere and there is no guarantee I would not overwrite critical data. It is also being used asynchronously so I cannot simply save the current contents of the clipboard, use the clipboard, and then restore the previous contents of the clipboard.p  pSo, is there any way to get the pasting preprocessing to occur when setting the value for a range with a formatted stringp

Negative 9002 pI am in the process of implementing the jqGrid with MVC 2 and the entity framework.  I would like to take advantage of its multiple search functionality combined with pagingsorting as well as CRUD interaction.

Negative 9002 pI usually declare my classes and templates, and then define their methods after in the same header file, of course. I just find it easier to read that way.

I need the enableif to distinguish the case where one passes in two objects of type T, and when one passes in a pair of Iterators. The code works fine if the templated constructor is defined inside the main template, which is how the code currently does it, but Id much rather move the definition outside the declaration.p  pstrongEDITstrong I should mention that I cant just reuse enableiflt... in the definition, because enableiflt... assigns a default value for its type, which you cannot do in a definition that isnt also a declaration.p

Negative 9002 pThis is a complex question, so please bear with me through the long explanation. p  h3Current scenarioh3  pWe are using Spring MVC 3.0.5 with Apache Tiles 2.2.

Reason is, that different user groups will have customized templates according to their group.p  pLets say all my current view definitons reside in p  precode WEBINFdefaultviewsviews.xml codepre  pAnd I want to add a second folderp  precode WEBINFadministratorviewsviews.xml codepre  pThis second folder shall contain view definitions strongwith the same namesstrong as in the codedefaultviewscode folder.

When a specialized view name for admin in the example above does not exist in the corresponding views folder, we want to display the default version from the other folder.p  h3So farh3  pCurrently I am thinking about several starting points. Maybe I could be tweaking the codeTilesConfigurercode. which keeps Tiles view definitions in a single property without distinction for the folders from where the view definitions came. p  pAnother option is trying to accomplish this using a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.0.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlmvc.htmlmvcviewresolverchaining relnofollowchained view resolversa with the specialized ones being further up in the chain and the default ones at the end.p  pA third option is using different view names and a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.0.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlportlet.htmlportlethandlermappinginterceptor relnofollowintercept the view name response from the controllera using a codeHandlerInterceptorcode to map it to the specialized view may not work if it does not exists.p  h3Questionsh3  ul liWhat are good options to implement this viewresolution mechanism  ul liAllowing viewdefintions to be overridden by others  more specialized onesli liMaking the display depend on the URL pattern of the requestli ulli ul  pAt the moment, my option 2 sound most convincing since I would like to prevent from twiddling with Springs classes when its not really necessary.

Negative 9002 pThis sounds really simple but its like an onion  lots of layers as you peel. I have a hierirachy of my own object classes  a bit like the components on a form really, in that any of them can have children and a parent. At the top there is a root object. Other code manages this hierarchy and it is possible that branches or leaves may be created, deleted or renamed at any time. I wish to have a tree view of some kind, probably virtual which provides a view of this heirarchy in such a way that it is possible to have multiple of these tree views, each drawing themselves from the object hierarchy as required.p  pI already have a solution using Delphis TTreeView but it relies on iterating through the hierarchy when a changed flag is raised and rebuilding tree view branches that have changed. This is slow I can have over 1000 objects and Id like an algorithm that manages to do a single tree view change for a single object insertion or deletion. Is this possiblep

Negative 9002 pI am writing a Cocoa application that uses CoreData. I have several versions out right now to the testers, and they want to be able to keep their data when they upgrade to the latest beta version. Ive been using mapping models to migrate the database automatically so far from one version to another, no problem.p  pBut this time, I have to migrate a database where what was once an optional relationship becomes a nonoptional relationship. When CoreData migrates to this version, it crashes, saying that the relationship is required. This makes sensehow could it possibly know what to put in there for those objects without the relationship in the earlier versionp  pSo I guess I need to write some code somewhere that creates a new managed object to fill the relationship if its nil in the old database.

Negative 9002 pOK its a general question, just how the system of my game should work. So there are lots of enemies and a player.

Also, all the monsters will always move the same. The move of the monsters will never be affected by the player. I cant do it kinematic because they DO affect from the gravity.

The php script  phppage.php  called by the ajax function does nothing more than echo hello world.p  pWhen the alerta line is left in the recall function withing the ajax function, then the code works as expected, and the final line pops up the message hello world. However then the alerta line is commented out, then the final line does not give hello world, but the value 13, as is set in the constructor function.p  pIm trying this on firefox 3.6.18p  pAny help would be gratefully appreciated.p  precodefunction A      this.b  13     function finishcontext,response          context.b  response          ajaxfinish,this   A.prototype       constructor A   function ajaxcallback,context      var http  new XMLHttpRequest     var url  phppage.php     http.openGET, url, true     http.onreadystatechange  recall     function recall          alerta         ifhttp.readyState  4 ampamp http.status  200              callbackcontext,http.responseText                   http.sendnull   var d  new A alertd.b codepre

Negative 9002 pWhen you assign an object to a Content control it will materialize a Visual appropriate for that assigned object. Is there a programmatic way to achieve the same result I would like to call a function in WPF with an object and get back a Visual, where the same logic is applied in generating the Visual as if you had supplied the object to a Content control instance.p  pFor example, if I have a POCO object and assign it to a Content control and there happens to be an appropriate DataTemplate defined then it materializes that template to create the Visual.

Negative 9002 pIm beging to work on a redesign software design of XAMLbased application, I wrote 2 months ago. I think I made lots of architectural mistakes during development, which led to situation when the UI part of app is hard to extend, maintain, code is hard to understand. My app is written using PRISM 4 in MVVM style, but despite the fact that Prism was invented for modular design my App turned out to be very monolithic. Im going to continue to use PRISM 4 in new design, but this time I want to break my UI part of application in smaller, reusable, extendable building blocks.p  pSuppose we are designing data input form.Top container contains Save,Cancel buttons and TabControl, which contains 23 tabs that contain lots of grouped input controls.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXjzZk.png altenter image description herep  pThe are 2 completly different aproaches to UI design I can see static compiletime, dynamicruntime. Static its when you predefine your UI before compiling, i.e DataGrid with columns defined in XAML. Dynamic its when you compose UI at runtime, i.e you defined DataGrid in XAML but add columns at runtime based on user asctions.p  pWhat rules you use when you decide which aproach to use, sattic or dynamic What you would choose in this particular examplep  pNext big question is how to break UI to pieces.p  pWhat rules you use when you define UserControls, how you would define UserControls for this example form Now about ViewModels, would you create single VM for this example form or multiple explain What do you think about situations when ViewModel contains other ViewModels not simple wrapers around model, but real VM which contains logic.p  pAnd now the hardest question at least for me. Extending UI building blocks UserControls and ViewModels.p  pSituation when you need to create a copy of some Form but with slightly different interface andor logic is quite often, especially when you need to integrate authorization permissions in UI. Suppose we need to support slighly different version of out example form doesnt matter how many exactly versions, suppose 26.p  pI can think of these aproaches to solve this problemp  ol lipCreate duplicates of whole from usercontrols and viewModels and modify them the static way. The good thing all variants are independent, great flexibility, no dependecies, the bad thing code duplicate, if you will need to change something in all variants most likely you will have to modify this everywhere, especially with ViewModels.pli lipConditional presentartion, you add lots of conditional code to your ViewModel, like IsThisVisible, IsThatDisabled the dynamic way. The good thing maximum code reuse, the bad thing code bloat and mess. Your code will be hard to understand,maintain.pli lipBreak UI to very small atomic UserControls, compose separate form variants from this UI pieces, and use ViewModel inheritance with virtual members and overrides. I havent ever used inheritance of ViewModels, and would like to hear your opinion on this subject.pli ol  pn. Other aproaches I cant think of.p

Then I triedp  precodevar t new Array var i0q0 ilenmessage ii forq0qltiq,qq1 t[q]m[q]  codepre  pWhich failed because the python q variable would reset every time the loop did, which is the heart of my problem. I also tried using popp  precodeforq0qltiq,qq1     alertm.pop      codepre  pBut the array keeps resetting again at the start of the loop, so it keeps showing the same variable. Is there a simpler way to copy the arrays, or to stop the python variables resetting, or even simply to plug the javascript q variable into m[q] insteadp  pFrom what Ive found, the problem comes from python being server side so you cant assign javascript values to its variables, but Im not sure what that has to do with the loop part of it If I do the same outside a loop, the values do not reset. The common solution seems to be to use ajax or json, but Id like to avoid that if possible. Thanksp

Negative 9002 pWhen I call undo on the context following deletion of a single object, all works as expected.

Negative 9002 pI am working a fairly simple Rails app where people can ask questions and upvote questions. I want to build in some realtime functionality and decided to go with Pusher to do so mainly because it seems very compatible with deploying on heroku.p  pCurrently when you add a new question, the following bit of javascript gets executedp  precodeif .question.hasClassnocurrentquestionsnotice     .nocurrentquestionsnotice.fadeOut 400, gt          this.replaceWithlt escapejavascriptrender questionsaddedquestion, question gt addedquestion gt     .lastquestion.hide.fadeIn 400  else   .lastquestion.removeClasslastquestion     addedquestion.replaceWithlt escapejavascriptrender questionsaddedquestion, question gt addedquestion gt   .lastquestion.hide.fadeIn 400 codepre  pI was hoping that I could simply reuse my partial in the Pusher callback so I could recreate what happens after an AJAX request for a pusher event.

So my this throws up the error undefined method content for nilNilClass right when I try to load the page. This makes sense because question isnt defined until there is a createquestion event. However, I dont understand why Rails is trying to render that partial before the createquestion event. BTW I checked and without the partial, everything else works and the data gets sent through from Pusher.p  pMost other examples of pusher integration I found had fairly heavy clientside javascript. As I am no javascript wizard, I was hoping that I dont have to redo the frontend of my app just to incorporate pusher. Is there a way to keep my code DRY and use my partials in a Pusher callbackp

I ran into problems when I wanted to export my data to XML because it was picking up the parent class no matter what I did with Accessor being NONE.

If I run my command with that glob, it takes out all the settings files in levels deeper than two as well. In the file tree example above, that means that coderootdirectoryorangesnavelsgoodsettings.phpcode would get nuked.p  hr  pIve tried to solve this on my own, trying variations on the file glob and using the wonderful codedryruncode option for codegitrmcode. Nothing seemed to workall I could figure out how to do was change the file tree depth at which started I removing settings files.p  pI did find one thing that seemed extremely relevant to my  problem. In the manpage for codegitrmcode, there is this examplep  precodegit rm Documentation.txt   Removes all .txt files from the index that are under the Documentation   directory and any of its subdirectories.    Note that the asterisk  is quoted from the shell in this example this   lets git, and not the shell, expand the pathnames of files and   subdirectories under the Documentation directory. codepre  pRemoves all...files from the index that are under the...directory and any of its subdirectories is consistent with whats actually happening. Whats really interesting is the mention of the quoted asterisk. I understand that this lets codegitrmcode handle the file glob expansion as opposed to codebashcode. Okay. But that leaves these questionsp  ul liWhy would I want to do thatli liIm emnotem quoting my asterisks, so codebashcode should be doing the expansion. If thats true, and my file glob works with codelscode, then why isnt it working with codegitrmcodeli ul  pIve also seen the example directly beneath the one above, and it seems to do what Im trying to do. And yet, that does not happen for me, or else I would not be here. It does seem to confirm that I emwantem to do file expansion with codebashcode, though.p

Negative 9002 pIm looking to filter a 1 bit per pixel image using a 3x3 filter for each input pixel, the corresponding output pixel is set to 1 if the weighted sum of the pixels surrounding it with weights determined by the filter exceeds some threshold. p  pI was hoping that this would be more efficient than converting to 8 bpp and then filtering that, but I cant think of a good way to do it. A naive method is to keep track of nine pointers to bytes three consecutive rows and also pointers to either side of the current byte in each row, for calculating the output for the first and last bits in these bytes and for each input pixel compute p  pcodesum  filter[0]  lastRowPtr amp aMask gt 0  filter[1]  lastRowPtr amp bMask gt 0  ...  filter[8]  nextRowPtr amp hMask gt 0code, p  pwith extra faff for bits at the edge of a byte. However, this is slow and seems really ugly. Youre not gaining any parallelism from the fact that youve got eight pixels in each byte and instead are having to do tonnes of extra work masking things.p  pAre there any good sources for how to best do this sort of thing A solution to this particular problem would be amazing, but Id be happy being pointed to any examples of efficient image processing on 1bpp images in CC. Id like to replace some more 8 bpp stuff with 1 bpp algorithms in future to avoid image conversions and copying, so any general resouces on this would be appreciated.p

Negative 9002 pIm working on a resum builder application and Im faced with two different approaches for storing candidate qualification information such as emdegreeem, emwork experienceem and emcertificationcoursesem. The initial schema was a separate table for each of the previous entities with attributes describing each entity such as degree grade, major, faculty and university which points to a separate emuniversityem reference table. Upon adding resum items I will have to alter the schema by adding columns to each table.p  pHeres the schema for the current emdegreeem tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE degree    id int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   faculty varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   major varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   gradepctsystem varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   gradegpasystem varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   honours varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   countryid int11 DEFAULT NULL,   cityid int11 DEFAULT NULL,   uniid int11 DEFAULT NULL,   candidateid int11 DEFAULT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY id,   KEY countryid countryid,   KEY cityid cityid,   KEY uniid uniid,   KEY candidateid candidateid,  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COMMENTData store for a job seekers degrees AUTOINCREMENT1   ALTER TABLE degree   ADD CONSTRAINT degreeibfk1 FOREIGN KEY countryid REFERENCES country id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,   ADD CONSTRAINT degreeibfk2 FOREIGN KEY cityid REFERENCES city id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,   ADD CONSTRAINT degreeibfk3 FOREIGN KEY uniid REFERENCES university id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,   ADD CONSTRAINT degreeibfk4 FOREIGN KEY candidateid REFERENCES candidate id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE codepre  pWhats being suggested is having two tables for emresumem and emresum itemem that stores candidate qualification data in a keyvalue approach. The emresum itemem table will hold a row for each field name and will be used as reference for the actual emresumem table.p  pHeres the schema for the suggested emresumem and emresum itemem tablesp  precodeCREATE TABLE resumeitem    id int11 not null autoincrement,   name varchar255,   PRIMARY KEY id  engineinnodb default charsetutf8 commentReference table for resum items  CREATE TABLE resume    id int11 not null autoincrement,   candidateid int11 not null,   resumeitemid int11 not null,   resumeitemvalue varchar255,   PRIMARY KEY id,   KEY candidateid candidateid,   KEY resumeitemid resumeitemid,  engineinnodb default charsetutf8 commentData store for candidate qualification info  ALTER TABLE resume   ADD CONSTRAINT resume1 FOREIGN KEY candidateid REFERENCES candidate id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,   ADD CONSTRAINT resume2 FOREIGN KEY resumeitemid REFERENCES resumeitem id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE codepre  pHow would this work out in terms of scalability and performance Would this hold thousands of resums and fetch data efficiently Is the latter solution in fact easier in modifying qualification metadata such as years of experience and university name than altering the actual data definitionp

Negative 9002 pWe are currently considering migrating our database code in php to Doctrine2. It seems to us that most of the things we would like the do are possible with Doctrine2. There is only one thing which we are not sure if it is possible and how we should do that. Our database model cant be changed right now because another project is using the same database. We can only change one thing at a time. Of course we are also curious how to improve the database model but that is not our main concern.p  pThe issues is like this.

I am putting dynamically content into those tabs and I expect that if tab content cannot fit the tab than it will expand TabWidget in the scroll area.p  pNow it is filling space right when it fits the place, nice spacing and so. But if I fill it with lets say more linesheight 600px, than I can see the lines dissapearing somewhere down the tab and if I expand whole window TabWidget gets more space and more of my hiden widgets gets revealed.p  pAny ideas how can I force the content of the tabwidget to expand it rather then hide underp

Negative 9002 pI want to fade a WPF window in, but I cant do that unless the window is set to transparent and window style is set to none, and I dont want that. Instead I want to create the illusion that the window is fading in by putting on top of it whatever is under it and then gradually reduce the opacity so it is brought into view.p  pI know that in order to to this another window with transparency and no borders must be used as the object that holds the captured image and performs the fade.p  pSo in theory I know what I want, but I have no idea of how to capture as an image whatever is under a WPF window. Of course, the interface that I want to reveal will be hidden until the capture is performed, so the window on top doesnt capture the actual interface, and I will show the GUI only after the image has been captured, so it can be revealed after the image starts losing opacity.p  pThat was just an explanation for what I need this. The basic question is stronghow do I capture to an image whatever is under a window even if it requires the window to be transparentstrongp

Negative 9002 pI am trying to build a Mac application that uses a hrefhttpsgithub.comlukhnosobjectiveflickr relnofollowObjectiveFlickra, and thus has it as a nested framework.

But if I do so, the framework can not find its internal header files and my main application can find ObjectiveFlickr.h.

Negative 9002 precently we have deployed J2EE application on JBoss 7.1.1Final. This application is using CDI Weld implementation, JSF 2.1 Mojarra, Seam 3 and Hibernate 4. When were experiencing higher load, the application becomes slow. Even after the load drops down a little, the responsiveness remains poorer. The CPU utilization is around 300 on 8 core machine. So it seems that CPU is not a bottleneck. I also check wether database or IO might be a bottleneck and it is not. There is also enough memory, the JVM uses at most 2GB out of provided 3GB. I dont really know where else to look. When the server has high CPU utilization, I dumped threads that are using CPU most and it seems that there is some issue either with Weld or JSF, here are some of these thread dumps that occur frequently when the responsiveness is lowp  precode java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE     at java.lang.ThreadLocal.getThreadLocal.java143     at

The return value states whether or not they were able to open the URL.         return [super openURLurl]                 Otherwise, well see if it is a request that we should let our app open.

Negative 9002 pI have a little problem concerning performance of codejQuery.showcode. This problem occurs in IE8 probably also versions below, but IE8 is of my interest.p  pI have an array of jQuery objects, lets call it codeelementscode. I want to show them, so i didp  precodefor var i  elements.length  1 i gt 0 i      elements[i].show  codepre  pThe bottleneck seems to be the call to codeshowcode. The array is already generated, so that takes no time. looping through an array should not be a problem either.p  pI thought of reducing this to one call to codeshowcode by creating a new jQuery element containing all my elements. but I was not sure how to do this. I tried by codejQuery.addcode.p  precodevar elements  elements[0] for var i  elements.length  1 i gt 1 i       elements  elements.addelements[i]  elements.show codepre  pNow, this time it seems to be a problem with codejQuery.addcode. Probably because it always creates a new object.p  pSo, I thought of three different approaches that could solve my problem. Maybe you can help me with one of themp  ul liIs there a jQuery method like codeaddcode that does not return a new object, but instead adds it to the current jQuery elementli liIs there an easy and fast way to create a jQuery element by an array of jQuery elementsli liIs there a way to codeshowcode all jQuery objects in an array in a faster wayli ul  pAnswering just one of the question would probably help me out here. My problem is, that jquery always expects an array of codeDOM elementscode and not an array of codejQuery elementscode in its methods.p  pThanks a lot in advancep  p EDIT about the contents of codeelementscodep  pI have a jstree that dynamically creates nodes that is, codelicode elements. These elements have an attribute codedataidcode to identify them. Now, I could always query for something like li[dataidxxx], but this would be very slow. So instead, when codelicode elements are created, i cache them into a dictionary like object key is the dataid, value is the node. Out of this object, i generate my array codeelementscode. This happens very fast. The array can have a size of up to 4000 nodes. Every jQuery Element in the array only contains one DOMElement codelicode.p

The nested objects in the class constructor can contain any combination of properties and methods or other nested objects. Each individual object can have a property with the key inheritance that takes the following values implements, extends or false. Implements and extends correspond to the behavior of the Implements and Extends Mootools class mutators. Extends is the default, and is the method used when nothing is supplied for the inheritance property. A value of false will keep the given object and any objects nested within it from being inherited altogether.p  pThe entire code including examples can be found a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4013880 relnofollowhereap

Also, I think Im just not applying borders correctly, because the code below which I suspect shouldnt need to loop over each cell individually doesnt apply any borders.p  precodefrom openpyxl.style import Border  wb  loadworkbookfilename  fname ws  wb.worksheets[0]   for row in ws.rangeA1Lstrws.gethighestrow       for cell in row             cell.style.borders.left.borderstyle  Border.BORDERTHIN             cell.style.borders.right.borderstyle  Border.BORDERTHIN             cell.style.borders.top.borderstyle  Border.BORDERTHIN             cell.style.borders.bottom.borderstyle  Border.BORDERTHIN wb.savefname codepre  pSo this code emworksem, but it doesnt apply the border I expect the default border in excel and it takes a lot more steps than Id prefer. My expectation is that I should be able to do something like thisp  precodefrom openpyxl.style import Border  wb  loadworkbookfilename  fname ws  wb.worksheets[0]  range  ws.somerangefuncA1Lstrws.gethighestrow       range.style.borders.allborders  Borders.BORDERTHIN codepre  pDoes this functionality exist If not, can someone please be so kind as to at least explain how to apply the default border style and not this slightly thicker border None of Border.BORDERTHICK, Border.BORDERMEDIUM, Border.BORDERTHIN, or Border.BORDERHAIR seem correct.p  pThanksp

Negative 9002 pAs a new developer for Windows Phone 8 will be called WP8 from now, yet an experienced one of android, I wonder what difficulties will I have when developing for the WP8.p  pI would like to ask people who have developed for this OS, to learn from their experience.p  pTo be more specific, here are some of my questionsp  ol lipstrongApp size limitstrong On Android, each app has a maximum size of 50 MB yet for larger apps there is a library to enlarge it up to 4GB in additional to the 50MB. Is there a limit on WP8 if so, what is it, and is there a way to extend it toopli lipstrongMemory limitationstrong On Android, each app has a relatively small max heap size limit . Each app can use memory up to this limit, and if it tries to use more , the app crashes with outofmemory exception. what does WP8 have Does it have a virtual memory like on windowspli lipstrongEmulationampdesigner vs devicesstrong On Android , the emulator is really slow yet very functional , and both the emulator and the UI designer dont always have the same visual screen as on a real device. For example , on the emulator or especially the UI designer if the screen is shown in one way , it might be shown in a totally different way . Can the emulator and UI designer of WP8 be respected and really be used instead of a real devicepli lipstrongIDEs useful warnings amp tipsstrong On Android , each version has its own new API features , yet the IDE using the LINT tool will warn you if you use a toonew feature for the app in case it can run on older devices. Not only that, but it has tons of warnings and tips to assist you and become a better developer . Does Visual Studio has the same features hidden somewhere for development on WP8 pli lipstrongMultiscreen supportstrong On Android, many steps were taken in order to support multiple screens, resolutions and densities . They even made a length unit called DP which has a number of pixels based on the density of the device . What does WP8 have to offer in order to support multiple screens Do I have to check for such things by myself, or is there any outofthebox solution Ive also noticed a class called ViewBox  is it common to use it as a solution for handling different aspect ratio of screens pli lipstrongLow memory footprint UI componentsstrong On Android, some UI components were created with the thought of using as little memory as possible. As an example, all of the UI components that extend from AdapterView use an adapter which uses the minimal number of UI components to show an unlimited amount of data that the user can scroll for example the listView class. Does WP8 have a similar solutionpli lipstrongOther tipsstrong  Would love to hear other general tips about your experience, and if there are some things to be aware of. Maybe other topics that some of you know of, or things that other android developers have faced when developing for WP8 .pli ol  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 9002 pIm reading thinking in c chapter 6 initialization amp cleanup. The author said that p  blockquote   pIts actually more likely that the compiler will follow the practice   in C of allocating all the storage for a scope at the opening brace of   that scope. It doesnt matter because, as a programmer, you cant   access the storage until it has been defined. Although the storage is   allocated at the beginning of the block, the constructor call doesnt   happen until the sequence point where the object is defined because   the identifier isnt available until then. The compiler even checks to   make sure that you dont put the object definition where the sequence   point only conditionally passes through it, such as in a switch   statement or somewhere a goto can jump past it.p blockquote  pAnd then the author gives an example as followingp  precodeclass X  public   X   XX   void fint i    ifi lt 10      goto jump1  Error goto bypasses init      X x1   Constructor called here  jump1   switchi      case 1        X x2   Constructor called here       break    case 2   Error case bypasses init       X x3   Constructor called here       break       int main    f9   f11  codepre  pI dont understand why the above code is OK According to my understanding, codex2code can be bypassed initialization if codeicode is not code1code.p  pemstrongSupplementemstrongp  pThis sentence Ita actually more likely that the compiler will follow the practice in C of allocating all the storage for a scope at the opening brace of that scope. also confused me.p  pAccording to the authors description, at the opening brace of the codeswitchcode, the compiler has already allocated space for codex2code and codex3code. If this is the case, there is an opportunity for codex2code to be uninitializedcase 1 is not satisfied.p

Negative 9002 pI have been using the codeBatchSqlUpdatecode class successfully for a while. The only annoyance using it is that named parameters need to be registered before running any query using the codedeclareParametercode or codesetParametercode methods. This means that the type of the parameters has to be declared as well. However, Spring also provides a codeNamedParameterJdbcTemplatecode class which has a very convenient codebatchUpdatecode method that takes named parameters as input an array of maps or codeSqlParameterSourcecode objects strongwithout the need of declaring them firststrong. On top of that, this class can be reused easily and I also believe its threadsafe. So I have a couple of questions about thisp  ul liWhats the recommended way to perform multiple batch updatesli liWhy is this feature duplicated across two different classes that also behave differentlyli liWhy does codeBatchSqlUpdatecode require declared parameters if codeNamedParameterJdbcTemplatecode does notli ul  pThanks for the thoughtsp  pGiovannip

Negative 9002 pI am planning how I to write a GUI Java application that displays a form to the user to add information about themselves.  One of the things I want to include is the ability for the user to add a picture to the form. Upon submission the picture and the rest of the info will then be saved to a database. Being new to java I was hoping for some instructional Links or tips as to how to accomplish this.  I was thinking of setting one of my columns in my table as a BLOB type and then saving them to it, but that is just a shot in the dark.  I really dont know what the column type should be byte, blob, ect..., or how to code so that the picture will be saved to my database for display later.  I guess my question is how to get and save a picture to a database from a form.  I am going to attempt this using eclipse, and am still unsure what I will use for the database.  Sorry about any confusion, and thanks for readingp  pDrewp

Negative 9002 pI am currently trying to make a method that can handle reading in large XML files. All i need is a method that would loading in say 1000 lines at a time or in small batches.p  pI have been looking at streamreaders, xmlreaders and filestreams, I have seen some mentions of just keeping the stream open while processing data to get what i need but i cant seem to get my head round it.p  pI have spent a long time checking the similar questions but can seem to find anything that will help me.p  pps. first thought i was thinking of doing a for loop around the readline to a counter of 1000 but cant seem to figure out how to continue from that 1000 lines to reading another 1000 etc until the end of the file.p

Negative 9002 pI am working on a MATLAB Engine application.  In order for it to work, MATLAB needs to be added to the PATH environment variable so that the Engine application can find certain DLLs libeng and libmx.p  pWhen MATLAB is registered as a COM server, it writes its location into the registry and I can access it.  Using this information, is there a simple way to allow the Engine application to work without having to add MATLAB to the PATH  The Engine application could theoretically read the location of these DLLs from the registry, but the problem is that it wont even start up without those DLLs when compiled the standard way, according to MATLAB Engine compilation instructions.p  pI am not very familiar with winapi and not at all familiar with COM.p  pIs there an easy solution to let the problem find its DLLs based on the information from the registryp

Negative 9002 pI need a function which takes a list and return unique element if it exists or [] if it doesnt. If many unique elements exists it should return the first one without wasting time to find others. Additionally I know that all elements in the list come from small and known set A. For example this function does the job for Intsp  precodeunique  Ord a gt [a] gt [a] unique li  first  filter 1.length group.sort li     where first []  []           first xxs  x  ghcigt unique [3,5,6,8,3,9,3,5,6,9,3,5,6,9,1,5,6,8,9,5,6,8,9] ghcigt [1] codepre  pThis is however not good enough because it involves sorting n log n while it could be done in linear time because A is small.  Additionally it requires the type of list elements to be Ord while all which should be needed is Eq. It would also be nice if amount of comparisons was as small as possible ie if we traverse a list and encounter element el twice we dont test subsequent elements for equality with elp  pThis is why for example this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3710976countinguniqueelementsinalist37138863713886Counting unique elements in a lista doesnt solve the problem  all answers involve either sorting or traversing the whole list to find count of all elements.p  pThe question is how to do it correctly and efficiently in Haskell p

Negative 9002 pI am working on a project with class hierarchy as in the image. It has many classes but i am showing some of them. The problem is that there are some attributes that repeat in many classes but not in all classes. I want to reduce the occurance by creating a new class with common attributes, and use the class as Instance variable in all the classes. This way i can maintain my class instead of maintaining all the occurances all over the code. These attributes has no operation, and class also have methods so it does to fulfill the definition of class. The class has many levels of inheritance and if create subclasses, it has yoyo problem then, so i do not want them to be further subclassed.  I want to know is there any other way or any better way to do it. p  pimg srchttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu53204737LabelObjects.png altClass diagramp

Negative 9002 pI have multiple view helper paths, some of which might contain view helpers with the same name as other registered paths.p  pFor example codeviewhelperpath1code might contain codemyViewHelpercode, while codeviewhelperpath2code may also contain a emdifferentem view helper, but with the same name codemyViewHelpercode.p  pObviously I might run into some problems when calling codethisgtmyViewHelpercode I cant rely on getting the view helper I want, as this is dependent on which path is at the top of the stack.p  pIs there a way that I can specify which path I want to use at any given time A fully qualified path, if you like.p  pThanksp

The form must allow the user to edit codeTblcode data, so I cant just build a form based on a join query, as Access doesnt allow you to edit the results of a join.  In addition, the form must be sortable based on the codemaxDatecode column.p  pI built a separate codemaxDatecode aggregate query, then added a control to codeTblFormcode and set its ControlSource asp  precodeDLookUpmaxDate,maxDate,Item amp [Item] codepre  pBut in the resulting datasheet, I cant sort based on this column I assume thats because its not part of codeTblFormcodes record source.  So I tried building a query that includes the DLookUpp  precodeselect ,DLookUpmaxDate,maxDate,Item amp [Item] as maxDateField from tbl codepre  pThe form based on this query is extremely slow.p  pAny ideas on how I can build what Im looking forp

One table called Consumers with about strong200 fieldsstrong including one called METERNUMBERS. And then one other table called CustomerInfo with about 30 fields including one called Meter. These two meter fields are what the join or whatever method would be based on. The problem is that not all the meter numbers in the two tables match and some are NULL values and some are a value of 0 in both tables.p  pI want to join the information for the records that have matching meter numbers between the two tables, but also keep the NULL and 0 values as their own records. There are NULL and 0 values in both tables but I dont want them to join together.p  pThere are also a few duplicate field names, like Location shown in the graphic. If its easier to fix these duplicate field names manually I can do that, but itd be cool to be able to do it programmatically.p  pstrongThe key is that I need the result in a NEW tablestrongp  pThis process will be a one time thing, not something I would do often.p  pHopefully, I explained this clearly and if anyone can help me out thatd be awesomep  pIf any more information is needed, please let me know.p  pThanks.p

Negative 9002 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12928435csharpblockingwaitforresponseThis questiona asked how to communicate queries and receive responses.  I too want to send requests for action and information.  Some of these requests will take parameters, most will not.  And of the replies, almost all will send back OK but others send me information.  The two ends of the link know nothing about each other, except for this command protocol.  The OP got his answer, in telling him how to wrap his code.p  pI have been overwhelmed with such responses telling me what technologies to use, how to wrap the code, etc. and since I am doing brand new development with the latest tools, I have found and accepted that I want to use TAP, as Jon Skeet replied to OP of that question.

That form exists.  And the second strategy, not yet written, is for the two ends to communicate over the network between computers.  The server will be a Windows service, the command module a form that will send commands in response to manufacturing line automation.p  pIt does not help me to say, Use RPC, or use a socket.

Negative 9002 pWe are moving from coldfusion 9 verity to coldfusion 10 solr in an application that searches PDF files that have metadata attached to them. We get very different results in testing. We eventually found that solr is searching the file contents very differently than verity. Is there something we can tweak to make solr searching more efficient or get them to search the same We sometimes get very different results searching on a single word, not just multiple words.p  pEdit I found that the PDFs I was using were mostly really old and after doing a batch save in Acrobat to resave them as another version, I got much better results. That and the default operator in Verity was AND and SOLR is OR, so I changed that in the jetty config file under my collections folder. This all helped, but other than that, Im getting little differences here and there. I hope this helps or helps anybody else that sees this post. Not sure what else I can do to really tune it. p

Negative 9002 pI have a class called PaymentDetail. It has two attributes which are Payment amount and order id. In this class I have a method called getPaymentDetails which connects to a relational database and returns a collectionarray of more than one PaymentDetail a collectionarray of Payment amount and order id from a table. p  pNow in my study of object oriented programming and class diagrams I am quite new to this, I have learnt that a class is an encapsulation of data attributes and methods that work with this data. My question is stronghow does a method, which returns an array, work on the data of an object especially when the data of the object represents a single instance of data for a single instance of an object.strong p  pI intend on looping through the array and working with the data it contains and if possible have the object contribute to this however I dont know if it can. p  pSome of the possible solutions I have thought of is that multiple instances of the object could be mapped to the array however I thought that would be harsh on memory unless the object is recycled to handle the data in the array. I also thought that class names are traditionally not plural thus I didnt name the class PaymentDetails and have one of the attributes of type Array which would work with the array returned from the database. p  pWould someone please kindly clarify.p

I even understand why at least I believed and so I deleted the respective lines in the aLoader object at the end of preload. of course they are loaded within the script tag in my index pagep  precodeaLoader  [  load libsjquery1.10.2.min.js,  deleted this one  load libsjquery.easing.1.3.js,  deleted this one  load libsjquery.rotate.js,  deleted this one  load libsedge.1.0.0.min.js,  deleted this one     test hasJSON, yeplibsjson2min.js,        load templatesChart  workChart  Pageworkedge.js,        load templatesChart  workChart  PageworkedgeActions.js] codepre  pbecause I cant see why it would be necessary to load them more than once. Yet, after doing so only the first animation runs, the second does not any longer. But why I checked in the browser and see that jquery1.10.2.min.js is in the page so why cant or seems so the Edge files use it any longer The same for the other ones rotate etc.. I also tried to suppress these two lines from the function abovep  precodewindow.AdobeEdge  undefined AdobeEdge  undefined codepre  pwithout any result though. Where is the trick to avoid reloading those basic needed .js files Any ideas Thank you so much for advice Garavanip  pstrongJamiestrongp  pEDIT So ,hello Jamie I was so curious about your solution that I dropped everything else and tried it. Sadly it does not work in the situation I tried to explain as exactly as possible in the lines above this edit. To avoid any misunderstandings here my changed code following your instructions very good explanation by the wayp  pedgePreload.js in my version it has no filename addition and lies in my lib folder that is accessed by each new animation after the method by Andrew  see above p  precodewindow.AdobeEdge  window.AdobeEdge   window.AdobeEdge.

When I replace all in the aLoader again at least it works without showing errors concerning the new inserted lines. But I have no result. Yet, would be soooooooooo cool Did I miss something Did you really check thoroughly what I did in my initial lines abovep  pI am curious to hear your ideas Thank you so far for your interest and willing to share your knowledge of this complicated edge material not much discussed  for good reasons I guess  here in stack overflow.    p

Negative 9002 pIm using jarX that has embedded dependencies that conflict with my own dependencies, so Im creating a classloader to isolate jarXs dependencies from my main classloader.p  pjarX is outside my apps classpath, but my classes that use jarXs classes are in my classpath, so when I instantiate my classes loaded via the custom classloader, I run into the class identity crisis in the form of ClassCastException as the JVMs version of my classes are considered different from those loaded by my custom classloader.p  pI found a hrefhttpgiallone.blogspot.ca201301javahandmadeclassloaderisolation.html relnofollowthis blog posta where they solved a similar problem by only interacting with the custom classloader loaded classes via reflection, which seems to solve this problem.  p  pIt just feels like it should be easier than this.

Negative 9002 pI wrote some code in order to turn a string read in with getline into an array of cstrings. The problem Im having is that the items Im reading is not being stored in the array properly. I originally parsed the input based on the number of spaces in between them, and then going on from there, but that also got me the same problem. So I changed my parsing into whats below me, and Im getting the same exact problem, suggesting to me that my parsing works, but somewhere in the process of reading whats parsed into the char array, something is going wrong.p  pMy codep  precodeint i  0 unsigned inputSize  input.size unsigned int prev  0 prev as in previous space position whileprev  input.find , prev lt inputSize      i    prev          char charArray[i  2] memsetcharArray, 0, i  2   stringstream ssinput string buffer forint a  0 ss gtgt buffer a      charArray[a]  constcastltchargtbuffer.cstr  codepre  pWhat Im doing is that Im counting the number of spaces of my input, and making a char array of that number  2 2 because I need to end it with NULL. After that, I parse my input and read it into the array. I am using ss  buffer as my termination clause because I will not end up allocating memory outside the allocated memory for charArray. buffer.cstr gets me a const char, so I constcast it in order for me to store it into the nonconst array of char.

However, once I call codebuiltincmdargvcode the line codeprintfsn, argv[0]code prints absolutely nothing as if the argv was empty.

Negative 9002 pSo Ive been digging around AOSP trying to figure out how an android app is installed. So far this is where Im atp  pThe apk File will be sent from PackageInstallerActivity to InstallAppProgress where it invokes the PackageManager method stronginstallPackage.strongp  pThe previous call to PackageManager gets directed to the PackageManagerService, with the magic of AIDL took some time for me to understand this.p  pIn the core method stronginstallPackageWithVerificationstrong an instance of the PackageHandler gets created and the message passing takes place in a robust way with the usage of a bunch of status codes like INITCOPY, PACKAGEVERIFIED etc.p  pBased on the status codes of the messages received in the Handler the ops takes place. To start of with strongINITCOPYstrong  adds the package to the list of pending installs and invokes message with code strongMCSBOUNDstrong.p  pThis copies the basic files extracted from the apk files like the data files.p  pAnd somewhere down in the lane come the message with flag strongCHECKPENDINGVERIFICATIONstrong, which takes the package from the pending list parses the entries, especially the AndroidManifest file. Verifies and validates stuff like package signature, packageName etc etc.p  pThen a call is made to strongupdateSettingLIstrong which in turn makes 3 more important function calls eventually.p  ul listrongmoveDexFilesLIstrongli listrongsetPermissionsLIstrong  extracts dir res files, resources.arsc, Manifest.xmlli listrongupdatePermissionsLPwstrong  calls grantPermissionLPw  and adds the groupids of the permissions parsed from the manifest fileli ul  pAt this point of time the Package object has the respective groupids so until now I was able to figure out basically how Permissions gets transformed into groupids. Pardon my rant, I thought this might be useful for someone dubugging PackageManagerService, especially the scanPackageLI method it is easy to get lost in code.p  pNow the actual question, I know figuratively in android each app is nothing but a linux process controlled with its own uid and gids. We have the gids from the above I want to know how from the PackageManagerService this gets transformed to a linux process.p  pI know installd also plays a crucial role in the install process. strongBut I was unable to find the link where the permissions or access rights according to linux teminology is set for the package process in linux being installedstrongp  pKindly help me out.p

Now in this branch i changed the text to codeHi this is not it.code I committed this code too. Now i switched to master using codegit checkout mastercode and then merged the codenewbcode branch using git merge codenewbcode.

Negative 9002 pI am attempting to connect my Launchpad device to the Pololu MinIMU9v2 9DoF sensor via the I2C bus.  I am working in a Linux environment, compiling with armnoneeabigcc, and I have downloaded the swektm4c123gxl zip file from the Texas Instruments website.p  pIn digging through the drivers download, I identified a folder examplesperipheralsi2c that contains 3 demonstrations each in a single C file for using the I2C bus.  One runs the Launchpad as a slave, the next configures it as a loopback, and finally, there is one that interfaces the Launchpad with an Atmel I2Cbased memory device using what it refers to as soft I2c.p  pIm assuming that the soft part of this means that its software based, utilizing interrupts and all.  Im looking for a simpler solution, preferably without interrupts.  The loopback example worked like a charm, for instance, but in modifying it, I cant seem to get it to communicate with the MinIMU9, no matter what I try.  The documentation for the MinIMU9 is pretty clear, but I think Im just lacking an understanding on how to use this driver software.p  pFinally, I dont want to reinvent the wheel, but I cant seem to find any one else talking about I2C and the stellaris or tivac launchpads.  Am I way off the mark in trying to implement this in this way  If not, is there an easier way to go about this  And, if not, where can I learn more about whatever it is that Im missingp

Negative 9002 pemBackgroundemp  pLinqToObjects has the extension a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb338038.aspx relnofollowmethod codeCountcodea the overload not taking a predicate. Of course sometimes when a method requires only an codeIEnumerableltout Tgtcode to do Linq, we will really pass a richer object to it, such as an codeICollectionltTgtcode. In that situation it would be wasteful to actually iterate through the entire collection i.e. get the enumerator and move next a whole bunch of times to determine the count, for there is a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary5s3kzhec.aspx relnofollowproperty codeICollectionltTgt.Countcodea for this purpose. And this shortcut has been used in the BCL since the beginning of Linq.p  pNow, since .NET 4.5 of 2012, there is another very nice interface, namely codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgtcode. It is like the codeICollectionltTgtcode except that it only includes those member that emreturnem a codeTcode. For that reason it can be covariant in codeTcode codeout Tcode, just like codeIEnumerableltout Tgtcode, and that is really nice when item types can be more or less derived. But the new interface has its own property, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh881496.aspx relnofollowcodeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgt.Countcodea. See elsewhere a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12622539on SO why these codeCountcode properties are distinct instead of just one propertya.p  pemThe questionemp  pLinqs method codeEnumerable.Countthis sourcecode does check for codeICollectionltTgt.Countcode, but it does not check for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgt.Countcode.p  pGiven that it is really natural and common to use Linq on readonly collections, strongwould it be a good idea to change the BCL to check for both interfacesstrong I guess it would require one additional type check.p  pAnd would that be a breaking change given that they did not remember to do this from the 4.5 version where the new interface was introducedp  pemSample codeemp  pRun the codep  precode    var x  new MyColl     if x.Count  1000000000                var y  new MyOtherColl     if y.Count  1000000000           codepre  pwhere codeMyCollcode is a type implementing codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode but not codeICollectionltgtcode, and where codeMyOtherCollcode is a type implementing codeICollectionltgtcode.

Same result is seen in 4.5 and 4.5.1.p  hr  pstrongemUPDATEemstrong after comment elsewhere on Stack Overflow by user codesupercatcode.p  pLinq was introduced in .NET 3.5 2008, of course, and the codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode was introduced only in .NET 4.5 2012. However, in between, another feature, emcovariance in genericsem was introduced, in .NET 4.0 2010. As I said above, codeIEnumerableltout Tgtcode became a covariant interface. But codeICollectionltTgtcode stayed invariant in codeTcode since it contains members like codevoid AddT itemcode.p  pAlready in 2010 .NET 4 this had the consequence that if Linqs codeCountcode extension method was used on a source of compiletime type codeIEnumerableltAnimalgtcode where the actual runtime type was for example codeListltCatgtcode, say, which is surely an codeIEnumerableltCatgtcode but also, by covariance, an codeIEnumerableltAnimalgtcode, then the shortcut was emnotem used. The codeCountcode extension method checks only if the runtime type is an codeICollectionltAnimalgtcode, which it is not no covariance. It cant check for codeICollectionltCatgtcode how would it know what a codeCatcode is, its codeTSourcecode parameter equals codeAnimalcode.p  pLet me give an examplep  precodestatic void ProcessAnimalsIEnuemrableltAnimalgt animals      int count  animals.Count   Linq extension Enumerable.CountltAnimalgtanimals      ...  codepre  pthenp  precodeListltAnimalgt li1  GetSomeHUGEListOfAnimals ProcessAnimalsli1   fine, will use shortcut to ICollectionltAnimalgt.Count property  ListltCatgt li2  GetSomeHUGEListOfCats ProcessAnimalsli2   works, but inoptimal, will iterate through entire Listltgt to find count codepre  pMy suggested check for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgtcode would repair this issue too, since that is one covariant interface which is implemented by codeListltTgtcode.p  pConclusionp  ol liAlso checking for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltTSourcegtcode would be beneficial in cases where the runtime type of codesourcecode implements codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode but not codeICollectionltgtcode because the underlying collection class insists on being a readonly collection type and therefore wishes to emnotem implement codeICollectionltgtcode.li linew Also checking for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltTSourcegtcode is beneficial even when the type of codesourcecode is both codeICollectionltgtcode and codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode, if generic covariance applies. Specifically, the codeIEnumerableltTSourcegtcode may really be an codeICollectionltSomeSpecializedSourceClassgtcode where codeSomeSpecializedSourceClasscode is convertible by reference conversion to codeTSourcecode. codeICollectionltgtcode is not covariant.

Negative 9002 pIn my app, I store about 6 different keys in an NSDictionary and store that dictionary as a file so that it can be sent to other users of the app. Three of my keys are numbers that I store as strings for examplep  precode NSString altitudeData  [NSString stringWithFormat1.50f,altitude]  [mutableDict setObjectaltitudeData forKeyaltitude]  [mutableDict writeToFilefilePath atomicallyYES] codepre  pI zip it up with some relevant media files and send it.p  pUsually everything works fine. The app receives the zipped file, unzips it, reads the NSDictionary file which is basically an XML and creates an object based off of the information it just received.p  pHowever things do not work right consistently.

Most of the documentationcode I looked through download videos or images and I have following questions...p  ol lipIf we use Background Fetching or Silent push notifications, do we need to download data using a separate backgroundSessionConfiguration  Or can we do this by utilizing existing defaultSessionConfiguration  Because I can reuse the existing method rather than having a separate method for background downloads.pli lipIs it possible to use background transfers to download large set of data other than file assets pli lipAs I know background background fetch only allows about 1 minute to complete the task , is it possible to use a background transfer inside the fetch to extend that period   I mean, if we start a background transfer inside that background fetch request does the app execute it and complete the job.

Negative 9002 pI am writing a automated bot for an mmorpg, one of the necessary pieces of information is the players current heading.  The way the cameras view angles are stored in memory is rather complicated. I have access to three variables which I have named CamX1, CamX2 an CamY. p  pCamY is a floating point value ranging from .91 to .91, 0 is perpendicular.  A tricky thing though is the values is adjusted from its percentage to this value by passing it through a base 10 logarithm, you can see what I mean by looking at the code below that turns the value back into a percentage by using an inverse logarithm.p  pCamX1 is also a floating point value ranging from 1 to positive 1.  When looking due W or due E the value is 0. When looking south the value is negative, when looking north the value is positive.  This variable is extremely concluded because the value is passed through a base 10 logarithm but also the max value when looking due N or due S varies from .41 to 1 based on the current value of Y.  You can understand this better by looking at the code for converting CamX1 to a percentage.p  pCamX2 is the same as CamX1 except rotated 90 degrees, so instead of 0 when facing W or E it is 0 when facing N or S. Positive when E and negative when W. it is at its max value when facing W or E but that maximum value varies like CamX1 based on the cameras current Y view angle.p  pThe code below works with the exception of when you are facing within 10 degrees of any cardinal direction, for example when facing 350  360 degrees the value is always 350, one you cross over due north the value jump to 10 degrees and does not change until you pass 10 degrees, if you are facing 80 degrees  90 degrees the value is 80 degrees, 90  100 degrees is 100 degrees but 101 is 101 and so on.  The same issue exists with the Y value but only when within 10 degrees of 0, the value from 10 to 0 is .1 and once you cross 0 the value is .1 until you pass 10 degrees and then it increases correctly.  If you can explain the problem just with the Y variable I can most likely apply that to the problem with the X values and have a complete solution. Here is the codep  precodefloat GetYFactor      float yAsPercent  pow10,absCamY.9110     if yAsPercent gt 1 yAsPercent  1     return 1yAsPercent.59   float GetX1ViewAngleAsPercent      float x1AsPercent  pow10,absCamX1GetYFactor10     if x1AsPercent gt 1 x1AsPercent  1  GetX2ViewAngleAsPercent     return x1AsPercent   float GetX2ViewAngleAsPercent      float x2AsPercent  pow10,absCamX2GetYFactor10     if x2AsPercent gt 1 x2AsPercent  1  GetX1ViewAngleAsPercent     return x2AsPercent   float GetCurrentHeading      float deg  GetX1ViewAngleAsPercent  90      ifCamX1 gt 0 ampamp CamX2 gt 0 Q1         deg  90  deg     ifCamX1 lt 0 ampamp CamX2 gt 0 Q2         deg  90  deg     ifCamX1 lt 0 ampamp CamX2 lt 0 Q3         deg  180  90  deg     ifCamX1 gt 0 ampamp CamX2 lt 0 Q4         deg  270  deg       return deg  codepre  pThe reason for the code such asp  precodeif yAsPercent gt 1 yAsPercent  1 codepre  pis probably related to this problem, at the near maximums the value of the percentages would increase past 1 and go up to about 1.15, and that was my attempt at a quick fix. but it doesnt really fix the problem entirely.p  pI know this was a long read so thank you for your time, any help supplied would be greatly appreciated as i need accuracy of about 2 degrees so these 20 degree gaps are rather frustrating, also no need to worry about the case where any of the three values that we start with are exactly 0, it has never happened, try as I may. I believe this has do do with passing values lt .01 into the inverse logarithm function 10.009 but I dont have enough experience with this type of math to understand whats going on.p

I want to remove the title marked with red circle of the SettingsPanel because its already highlighted in the TabbedPanelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyVME7.png altScreenshot of DemoAppp  pWhats the easiest way to remove that titlep  pSetting the title to an empty string would be one option but then the label of the title is still there and the gap between the tab name and the first setting would be too large.p

This is necessary so that the user can save their items temporarily in the server side using session data. Something that you would expect for a shopping cart.p  pThen when the user is ready to move forward the application will then display the login screen and the user can authenticate themselves to checkout their items.p  pHowever, I cant seems to figure out yet how to do this using simpleauth. If I create a custom authenticator that just fetches token id from the server, it will mark the session as authenticated and will not ask for login on the authenticatedRoute. p  pIn general what Im trying to do arep  ol liCustomer visit the websiteli liThe application fetches session token from the serverli liCustomer clicks around and saves item into the shopping cart. The data is synced with the server using the session tokenli liCustomer ready to checkout and navigates to checkout pageli liThe application intercepts the route and redirect the customer to login route, where the customer can login and resume checkout.li ol  pI hope the above information is clear enough. Any hints and help will be much appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 9002 pI am developing a desktop application in Scala which has several dozen configuration options that users can configure. The options are defined as a trait so that there can be separate implementations for unit testing and the runtime applicationp  precodetrait Config    var showNotifications Boolean   var showOverlay Boolean    ...several dozen similar options  codepre  pThe implementation for unit testing is straightforwardp  precodeobject TestConfig extends Config    var showNotifications Boolean  true   var showOverlay Boolean  false    ...  codepre  pHowever the implementation for runtime use is more complex because it needs to persist changes and notify various listeners. I define the getters and setters directly to achieve this each getter and setter refers to a standard method like this p  precodeclass UserConfig extends Config     class BooleanPrefval key String, val default Boolean      def get          ... load configuration option ...          def setvalue Boolean          ... save configuration option ...            val prefShowNotifications  new BooleanPrefshowNotifications, true   def showNotifications Boolean  prefShowNotifications.get   def showNotificationsvalue Boolean  prefShowNotifications.setvalue    val prefShowOverlay  new BooleanPrefshowOverlay, false   def showOverlay Boolean  prefShowOverlay.get   def showOverlayvalue Boolean  prefShowOverlay.setvalue     ... repeated several dozen times ...   codepre  pThis results in a lot of boilerplate code, which seems like it should be unnecessary. Both the getter and setter have to be mapped individually for each configuration option even though they all work in exactly the same way. p  pIs there any way in Scala to define both a getter and setter at the same time  ie. instead of having thisp  precodeval prefShowNotifications  new BooleanPrefshowNotifications, true def showNotifications Boolean  prefShowNotifications.get def showNotificationsvalue Boolean  prefShowNotifications.setvalue codepre  pIs it possible to assign an object or function that implements both the getter and setter, something likep  precodeval showNotifications Boolean   something here codepre  pOr is there some other way to avoid defining getters and setters individuallyp

Negative 9002 pUsing Spring Integration 4.0.3.RELEASE, I see in the documentation that customization of the DefaultHttpHeaderMapper instances is supported but I am finding some unexpected results from doing so. p  pI have created a DefaultHttpHeaderMapper instance that allows for our proprietary header prefix in addition to the standard ones.p  pFor example responsep  precodeprivate static final String[] RESPONSEHEADERNAMEPATTERNS  DefaultHttpHeaderMapper.HTTPRESPONSEHEADERNAMEPATTERN, MYHTTPPREFIXPATT ... mapper.setOutboundHeaderNamesRESPONSEHEADERNAMEPATTERNS codepre  pI have done similar for the request side of things.p  pThere are methods to set exclusions on the instance as wellp  precodepublic void setExcludedOutboundStandardRequestHeaderNamesString[] excludedOutboundStandardRequestHeaderNames public void setExcludedInboundStandardResponseHeaderNamesString[] excludedInboundStandardResponseHeaderNames codepre  pIt appears the only place the exclusions might be processed in the class is in the codeshouldMapOutboundHeaderString headerNamecode method. strongHowever, the exclusion pathway does not execute if customization has been done.strong p  pLine 419 codeif this.outboundHeaderNames  HTTPRESPONSEHEADERNAMEScodep  pLine 431 codeelse if this.outboundHeaderNames  HTTPREQUESTHEADERNAMEScodep  pEven though I also included the standard header set, these conditions arent true since I also added my own header pattern. The effect is some standard headers that I need to be to be excluded e.g. codeContentLengthcode for response, as set by default via the codeHTTPRESPONSEHEADERNAMESINBOUNDEXCLUSIONScode field are not being excluded.p  pIt seems odd to me that headers can be set and exclusions can be set but if you dont use one of the static factory methods to create a completely unaltered instance, youre not going to get those exclusions removed.p  pI can think of a couple hacky ways around this, but since this seems like a simple enough use case just adding my own header pattern I am led to believe that I am not using the correct construct.p  pAny clarity on how Ive misunderstood the use of this class or suggestions for another way would be appreciated.p  hr  pstrongThe use case is about preserving the correct default management of standard headers e.g. http even if proprietary headers are also needed.strongp  pMy use case seems pretty standard recognizing that I am likely bias Server and client pass messages back and forth via http gateways. The messages themselves can have 3 types of headers p  ol liStandard headers for http functioning  li liMy proprietary headers for specific serverclient communication my prefix  li liHeaders that can be added during internal processing but should be stripped out before going across the wire to the other side.li ol  pThe issue surfaced when I upgraded from Spring Integration 2.1.0.RELEASE  4.0.3.RELEASE.  After the upgrade the codeContentLengthcode header was not being handled properly so the payload of the servers response was getting truncated request payload was smaller.  Some research showed things likep  ul lia hrefhttpsjira.spring.iobrowseINT2006 relnofollowhttpsjira.spring.iobrowseINT2006ali lia hrefhttpsjira.spring.iobrowseINT2744 relnofollowhttpsjira.spring.iobrowseINT2744ali ul  pThe DefaultHeaderMapper of the 2.1.0.RELEASE didnt have the exclusion logic indicating that this ContentLength situation was being handled elsewhere so my custom instance didnt have any ill effect.  In 4.0.3.RELEASE it seems that proper functioning of the ContentLength header relies on the exclusion logic now present in DefaultHeaderMapper. Since this doesnt get invoked because I had added my header pattern, the http communication does not work response is mangled.p

Negative 9002 pWhile playing about with optimisation settings, I noticed an interesting phenomenon functions taking a variable number of arguments code...code never seemed to get inlined. Obviously this behavior is compilerspecific, but Ive tested on a couple of different systems.p  pFor example, compiling the following small programmp  precodeinclude ltstdarg.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  static inline void testconst char format, ...    valist ap   vastartap, format   vprintfformat, ap   vaendap   int main    testHello sn, world   return 0  codepre  pwill seemingly always result in a possibly mangled codetestcode symbol appearing in the resulting executable tested with Clang and GCC in both C and C modes on MacOS and Linux. If one modifies the signature of codetestcode to take a plain string which is passed to codeprintfcode, the function is inlined from codeO1code upwards by both compilers as youd expect.p  pI suspect this is to do with the voodoo magic used to implement varargs, but how exactly this is usually done is a mystery to me. Can anybody enlighten me as to how compilers typically implement vararg functions, and why this seemingly prevents inliningp

Negative 9002 pI have built a Windows application for a touch screen using FPS Virtual Keyboard for WPF from FPS Components as my onscreen keyboard. This keyboard has a button for cycling through any keyboard languages installed in Windows, and everything works great throughout the application. The problem Im having appears with one aspect of the application where it can link to other locally networked panels running the same application and display some info entered from the first. If the user switches the keyboard language to, say, Arabic, the string sent to the remote panels is displayed as , I assume because the languages arent matching.p  pIs there a relatively simple way of determining what keyboard language was used to type a string, then display it properly From an application standpoint, the receiving panels dont need to actually change their local keyboard setting, so I would prefer to just be able to display the incoming string properly regardless of language, unless its a requirement of Windows that the local setting change.p  pThe panels are all running with Windows 7.p

Negative 9002 pI am using JSON.NET 6.0.3.

So the result could be a list of 5 cars from two unique manufacturer objects. I am expecting the JSON result to list each manufacturer only once fully serialized and then subsequent uses of the same Manufacturer to be ref ID to the originals id. That is not happening.p  pEven though I cant find a single piece of documentation that speaks about how equality is established for the ReferenceResolver, Ive implemented IEquatable along with override of base.Equals and base.GetHashCode with no luck. p  pId like to avoid implementing my own a hrefhttpjames.newtonking.comjsonhelpindex.html relnofollowIReferenceResolvera because have very similar object graphs working as expected in the same project.p  pThe only thing I can think of is that I am using factory objects and instead of creating each unique CarManufacturer first, then creating the instances of CarFromManufacturer passing in CarManufacturer... i am creating a new instance of the CarManufacturer. This would explain why the objects arent equal, but thats why I implemented IEquatable and overrides of base.Equalsobject and base.GetHashCode.p  pIve looked into the a hrefhttpsgithub.comJamesNKNewtonsoft.Jsonblobee170dc5510bb3ffd35fc1b0d986f34e33c51ab9SrcNewtonsoft.JsonSerializationDefaultReferenceResolver.cs relnofollowsource for DefaultReferenceResolvera and it uses the a hrefhttpsgithub.comJamesNKNewtonsoft.Jsonblobee170dc5510bb3ffd35fc1b0d986f34e33c51ab9SrcNewtonsoft.JsonUtilitiesBidirectionalDictionary.cs relnofollowdefault constructor of BidirectionalDictionarya which uses EqualityComparer.Default which, from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms224763vvs.110.aspx relnofollowMSDN documentationa, uses the Ts implementation of IEquatable if it exists, or otherwise uses Ts base.Equals implementation.... all of this would lead me to believe that IEquatable in CarManufacturer should fix my problem. However, placing breakpoints in CarManufacturer.Equals and GethashCode never hit..p

Player moves around and the snake is static, but it rotates around its center to follow players movement.p  pAt some point snake spits a fireball which is a dynamic body with CircleShape sensor fixture attached.

So it seems that even though provided linear velocity value is always small, sometimes box2d engine processes this incorrectly...p  pI also tried to make fireball radius bigger just in case it was to small to calculate or smth, but it did not matter.p  pBox2d coordinates are kept between 0 and 10 units as advised in the manual.p  pWhat can cause this problemp

Negative 9002 pIve seen many guides and there always seem to be something missing.p  pstrongIf someone can post here a complete idiots guide it will be greatstrongp  pIn any case, I will provide here what Ive tried to do so far Ive tried to download stronglibjpegstrong and got confused with all the configerations needed and makefiles. Ive downloaded stronglibjpegturbostrong, and currently Im linking Successfully to jpeg.lib and including jpeglib.h.p  pIm using this code that I found on the web after doing some small modifications to it cause it wont compile, which gives me runtime error a buffer overrun has occured when the block ends when the last  is calledp  precodevoid TestModel3DwriteJPEGfilechar  filename, int quality, int w, int h       This struct contains the JPEG compression parameters and pointers to      working space which is allocated as needed by the JPEG library.      It is possible to have several such structures, representing multiple      compressiondecompression processes, in existence at once.  We refer      to any one struct and its associated working data as a JPEG object.          struct jpegcompressstruct cinfo      This struct represents a JPEG error handler.  It is declared separately      because applications often want to supply a specialized error handler      see the second half of this file for an example.  But here we just      take the easy way out and use the standard error handler, which will      print a message on stderr and call exit if compression fails.      Note that this struct must live as long as the main JPEG parameter      struct, to avoid danglingpointer problems.          struct jpegerrormgr jerr      More stuff      FILE  outfile      target file      JSAMPROW rowpointer[1]     pointer to JSAMPLE row[s]      int rowstride      physical row width in image buffer          Step 1 allocate and initialize JPEG compression object        We have to set up the error handler first, in case the initialization      step fails.  Unlikely, but it could happen if you are out of memory.      This routine fills in the contents of struct jerr, and returns jerrs      address which we place into the link field in cinfo.          cinfo.err  jpegstderrorampjerr      Now we can initialize the JPEG compression object.      jpegcreatecompressampcinfo       Step 2 specify data destination eg, a file       Note steps 2 and 3 can be done in either order.        Here we use the librarysupplied code to send compressed data to a      stdio stream.  You can also write your own code to do something else.      VERY IMPORTANT use b option to fopen if you are on a machine that      requires it in order to write binary files.          if outfile  fopenfilename, wb  NULL          fprintfstderr, cant open sn, filename          exit1          jpegstdiodestampcinfo, outfile       Step 3 set parameters for compression        First we supply a description of the input image.      Four fields of the cinfo struct must be filled in          cinfo.clientdata  voidampoutfile       cinfo.imagewidth  w   image width and height, in pixels      cinfo.imageheight  h     cinfo.inputcomponents  3       of color components per pixel      cinfo.incolorspace  JCSRGB      colorspace of input image       Now use the librarys routine to set default compression parameters.      You must set at least cinfo.incolorspace before calling this,      since the defaults depend on the source color space.          jpegsetdefaultsampcinfo      Now you can set any nondefault parameters you wish to.      Here we just illustrate the use of quality quantization table scaling          jpegsetqualityampcinfo, quality, TRUE  limit to baselineJPEG values        Step 4 Start compressor        TRUE ensures that we will write a complete interchangeJPEG file.

Negative 9002 pI have an iPhone application most of which is portraitonly, but with one view controller a video player screen that has to support both portrait and landscape this is for iOS 8 only. To achieve this, I have set the apps plist to support portrait and both kinds of landscape, then subclassed codeUINavigationControllercode in this subclass I overridep  precode BOOLshouldAutorotate      return YES  codepre  pand p  precode NSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations       if [self.visibleViewController isKindOfClass[MyVideoPlayerScreen class]]          return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAllButUpsideDown      else          return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait        codepre  pThis emmostlyem works as expected the initial screens are all portraitonly, and remain in portrait even when the device is turned to landscape. The video player, when initially presentedp  precodeMyVideoPlayerScreen newVC  [MyVideoPlayerScreen new] [self.navigationController pushViewControllernewVC animatedYES] codepre  pis also in portrait but will then rotate to landscape when the device is turned  all good so far.p  pThe problem is that if I turn the device to landscape, the video player goes landscape as well, but then when I dismiss the video player screen via the back button, the underlying view controller which is supposed to be portraitonly is now also in landscape. If I rotate the device back to portrait the view controller rotates back to portrait as well, and it is then correctly locked in portraitonly from that point on.p  pstrongHow can I get the original view controller which is supposed to be portraitonly to automatically go back to portrait when the landscape view controller above it is poppedstrongp  pThis question has been asked a million times, but it seems that the fixes that were posted for it are all hacks that dont work in iOS 8 any more.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I have found a sortof fix for this that does work in iOS 8. In my codeUINavigationControllercode subclass, I handle the codeltUINavigationControllerDelegategtcode protocol. I implemented this methodp  precode voidnavigationControllerUINavigationController navigationController didShowViewControllerUIViewController viewController animatedBOOLanimated       if [viewController isKindOfClass[MyVideoPlayerScreen class]]            if the current orientation is not already portrait, we need this hack in order to set the root back to portrait         UIInterfaceOrientation orientation  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]         if orientation  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait                HACK setting the root view controller to nil and back again resets the navigation bar to the correct orientation             UIWindow window  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow]             UIViewController vc  window.rootViewController             window.rootViewController  nil             window.rootViewController  vc                   codepre  pThis at least leaves the UI in the state I want it to be in. The problem is that when the toplevel view controller is dismissed and animated offscreen, the underlying view controller is still in landscape then it suddenly jumps to portrait. Not ideal, but better than nothing.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I should have added that I am pushing the second view controller like sop  precodeViewControllerPortraitLandscape newVC  [ViewControllerPortraitLandscape new] [self.navigationController pushViewControllernewVC animatedYES] codepre  pstrongUpdate 3strong OK, this is totally doable, in a way that works for iOS 6 and up. The fix even kind of makes sense, although the reason for its working does not seem to be in the documentation anywhere. Basically, in the view controller that you need to be reset to portrait when the toplevel view controller is dismissed while the device is still in landscape, you just need to add thisp  precode NSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations      return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait  codepre  pAlthough my subclass of codeUINavigationControllercode is entirely responsible for the rotation calls, breakpoints show that codesupportedInterfaceOrientationscode is called on the underlying view controller just embeforeem the toplevel is dismissed, and its called on the navigation controller emafterem the toplevel is dismissed. So Im inferring that this call to the view controller itself is made by iOS in order to determine what orientation the underlying view controller should be in and it does not ask the nav controller for this if its not explicitly overridden it will return the allbutupsidedown parameter, so iOS just leaves it where it is, in landscape.p

So in our specific example above again we would have 16 combinations for a set of 4. p  pIs there an algorithm that already does this If not would anyone have some logic to implement this in Javap  pThanks,p
Negative 9002 pI am trying to write a code that make it so that an element will come to the front using a higher zindex when clicked, which I seem to have figured out, and I am trying to make that element maintain a different color identifying it as the current page. I would like to allow a mouseover function though to change the color of the other elements to identify them as other buttons, and these elements look like file tabs so it looks mush better this way. Unfortunately, I added a javascript code so that the elements will go back to the original gradient color when another is clicked, but I cant seem to figure out how to get a mouseover function to work for each individual element.

Negative 9002 pBefore I place my question, I must confess that I am a total newbie to both Java and Spring and hence my question may sound completely nonsensical. I have a Spring based Java application and my job is to write integrationacceptance tests for it. Now when I scanned through the project structure I could see that there are multiple Beans spread across different modules which I will need to instantiate to build my test case. A quick look through Spring tutorials also told me that I have to load the Application Context xml before doing any meaningful work with the beans. So, I loaded the Application Context XML of the module that I wanted to test. But when I execute the test, Spring complains that it was not able to locate a bunch of other beans. Now, I know that these bunch of beans are there in other modules with their wiring information in some other Application Context xml files. My question is, in a Spring projectp  ol lipWould there be a parent level Application Context xml file that I should be loading instead of module specific onespli lipIs it possible that I create an Application Context xml for my test project and import all the other Application Context xmls inside thatpli lipAny other solution...pli ol  pAny help is highly appreciated p

I want the toast to always show the end of the string but cut of the beginning if the text is too much to display at one time in the toast. Is there an easy way to do this pleasep

I can manually run codecordova plugin add ltplugingtcode for each cordova plugin and when building and deploying the missing functionality shows up but the process seems a bit inefficient and prone to error if someone forgets to add a plugin.p  pVarious guides have suggested running codecordova prepare ioscode but this doesnt seem to do much.p  pThis a hrefhttpjbavari.github.ioblog20140624managingcordovapluginswithpackagedotjsonandhooks relnofollowblog post by Josh Bavaria suggests some hacking around to automate the process, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21791323cordovacliusinggitandsavingpluginsplatformsthis post talks about something similara but theyre half a year old now.p  pAm I missing something obvious here, or is the manual codecordova plugin addcode process a normal part of dev workflow Cheers.p

Negative 9002 pIm new to JSF and Im trying to write a simple DB Explorer using PrimeFaces and Wildfly. I want a Tree component for browsing the data, with a GridPanel to show details when something is selected from the tree. Nothing too complex, just to get grips with syntax and logic.p  pMy problem is this when I select something from the tree, the callback method is correctly called in the ManagedBean, but the GridPanel does not show up. Its bound to be shown when the selected value in the ManagedBeans is not null.p  pindex.xhtmlp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml     xmlnsuihttpjava.sun.comjsffacelets

Negative 9002 pHy,p  pI use alert dialog to display some annotations to navigation through application.

As stated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23467994errorsmanagingtheunityplayerlifecycleinanativeandroidapplicationherea, mUnityPlayer.quit completely kills the process it is running in. So basically what happens is that the entire app exits when I switch fragments i.e., switch tabs in the NavigationDrawer, because that calls the onDestroy of the UnityPlayerNativeFragment.p  pI do NOT want this. Ideally, the user would switch to another tab in the NavigationDrawer, and when heshe comes back to the tab of the Unity scene, it is exactly where heshe left it. As though they used the Android multitasking to change apps and return  nothing changes.p  pIf this were an Activity, it would be possible to open it in a different process than the main app by adding the codeandroidprocessUnityKillsMecode line in the Manifest file, but this isnt possible for a fragment. So, my questionsp  ol liHow can I open the UnityPlayerNativeFragment in a new process, so that the .quit function doesnt kill my entire app, and so that I can relaunch the fragment when the user leaves the tab and then returns to itli liEven if I can achieve Q1, there remains the issue of state. Quitting and then reloading the Unity scene will recreate it anew, starting from the default view, and losing any properties it had e.g. imagine it was a game, then all the data would be lost.

Negative 9002 pConsider the usage with codestdmultimapcode, where I am given a range of iteratorsp  precodestdunorderedmultimapltstdstring, MyObjectgt mymap  autoamp range  mymap.equalrangesomekey for autoamp thepair  range   codepre  pNow, the code above does not compile, but I am using it for demonstration purposes. Is it possible to use rangebased for loops with a pair of iterators like this I dont imagine it is possible directly, so I guess my question is really about whether or not there is an adapter class in STL for this use case. I could probably write my own but this seems like a common case.p  h1Updateh1  pIf this is not a common case and STL does not provide such a proxy or adapter for this type of usage, what is required to implement them I was thinking that Id need to overload the free functions codebegincode and codeendcode and also define an adapter iterator class for codestdpairltT,Ugtcode. Im just taking a conceptual stab at it, but please let me know Thanks in advance everyone.p

Negative 9002 pSorry for the lousy title. Its hard to describe my problem.p  pIm programming a user interface with jbuttons controlled with gaze. And I want the user to dont see the cursor moving around inside a jbutton, i.e. if the cursor is within the jbuttons bounds I want it to beseem still. Another way of looking this is like a magnetic behaviour...the cursor should be attracted to the center of the nearest jbutton. And when it is, animate it with a sort of loading bar.p  pHoping the problem was understood, the possible ideas I thought of are 1 when the cursor enter the jbutton make it invisible and start filling the jbutton as a loading bar the goal is to click the jbutton after it has been hovered for a few seconds 2 when the cursor enter the jbutton make it invisible and paint a running clock over it similar to the above, but the implementation may be differentp  pwhat do you think its more doablep  pps I hope I will be improving the question with help of your answersquestions.p

There is a filter included that allows a user to search the results using a text input, and codesliceResultscode is a custom filter for my a hrefhttpangularui.github.iobootstrappagination relnofollowAngularUI paginationa it determines the offset and limit of results to display based on the current page of the pagination.p  precodelttablegt     lttr ngrepeatresult in ctrl.results  ctrl.persons  filtersearchKeywords  sliceResults ctrl.paginationOffset  ctrl.paginationLimitgt         lttdgt index1 lttdgt         lttdgt result.firstName lttdgt         lttdgt result.lastName lttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt  Results   ctrl.results.length  codepre  pstrongSituationstrongp  pAt the end of the code, codectrl.results.lengthcode returns the amount of results realtime, and changes accordingly when a user fills out the text input to search through the results.p  pHowever, when the amount of results change, my pagination does not change accordingly and therefore shows an incorrect amount of pages e.g. it can still show 3 pages while there is only 1 page. The amount of pages is based on a variable in my controller codethis.paginationTotalItemscode.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I update the variable codethis.paginationTotalItemscode in my controller as soon as the amount of results codectrl.results.lengthcode change in my view Or, what alternative way is there to update my paginationp  pstrongWhat I triedstrongp  pI am far from being an AngularJS expert, so dont laugh at me I tried to put a function in codengchangecode with the result count, which failed because apparently it requires codengmodelcode and I dont see that working with codengrepeatcode.p  pI also tried to use codewatchcode on the codectrl.resultscode variable, but that results in a massive console error because it aborts after x iterations. Also, Id rather not use codewatchcode because I read it only works with codescopecode, which Id rather not use I use the controller as syntax.p  pThanks in advance, Ill accept the answer that helps me solve my issue.p

Negative 9002 pMy problem is the following I want to add cuda code into an already existing c library and reuse my existing code as much as possible. In order to use polymorphism, I use template classes and template kernels. As such, everything is implemented in .cpp, .h and .cuh files. No .cu file is involved, and therefore nvcc is not used and the c compiler chokes on the ltltlt  kernel invocation syntax.p  pI have already seen  [a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18200952howtoseparatethekernelfilecudawiththemaincppfile][1]How to separate the kernel file CUDA with the main .cpp filea and [a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17774217howtocallacudafilefromacheaderfile][2]How to call a CUDA file from a C header filea but I cannot find any design that would solve my problem.p  pThe files involvedp  pmain.cppp  pInstanctate a bunch of my already existing classes, pass them to a CudaPrepare class that composes them and is responsible for preparing the data to be passed to cuda code with only primitive types.p  precodeinclude CudaPrepare.h include CudaSpecificType1.h include A.h already existing classes  include B.h already existing classes  void main      A a...

CudaClassrun cannot be moved to a .cu file since the class is templated.

In particular, A.h and B.h contain a lot of enum classes...p

Negative 9002 pI normally do that a lot but this time, something mightve gone wrong. After installing Ubuntu 14.04 to dual boot with windows, I couldnt get the chance to boot into windows anymore. Its like the windows boot files or something are missing. I installed Ubuntu by assigning a logical drive from the free space as swap area, then assigning the partition space that I wanted as Logical ext4 assigned as  or root. Normally what it used to do was to give you the choice to choose whether to boot via windows or ubuntu at start, but now it just logs to Ubuntu. I installed boot repair and got the following link a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com10869754 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com10869754ap  pI know it is a problem with the windows boot files, but I dont know how to exactly fix it from inside ubuntu. p  pExtra Details Windows should possess around 440450 GB of storage while I assigned 5060 GB of storage to Ubuntu.

Negative 9002 pI am trying to figure out if the following scenario is possible, and would like suggestions as to how I can go about it.p  pI would like to fork process P1, and create process P2. The process P2 should not impact the state of process P1 in any way. The stacklocal variables, and heap memory is normally copiedonwrite by the call to fork, hence that should not be a problem. However, any changes made to the disk by P2 will be visible to P1 as well. p  pI am looking for a solution to create the new cloned process P2, which instead of running on the original filesystem, is able to run on a cloned filesystem. I assume that such a functionality could be possibly created using ZFSBTRFS or other similar file systemsp  ul li The end result should be that any write operations done by P2, should not impact process P1. I understand that any stack variables in that process are managed anyhow. However, any operations being done on the disk by P2, can potentially impact P1, which is what I am trying to avoid ltli ul  pI wonder if anyone with experience in these can give suggestionsp

Negative 9002 pSay you have to carry out a computation by using 2 or even 3 loops. Intuitively, one may thing that its more efficient to do this with a single loop. I tried a simple Python examplep  precodeimport itertools import timeit  def case1n     c  0     for i in rangen         c  1     return c  def case2n     c  0     for i in rangen         for j in rangen             for k in rangen                 c  1     return c  printcase11000 printcase210  if name  main     import timeit      printtimeit.timeitcase11000, setupfrom main import case1, number10000      printtimeit.timeitcase210, setupfrom main import case2, number10000 codepre  pThis code runp  precode python3 code.py  1000 1000 0.8281264099932741 1.04944919400441 codepre  pSo effectively 1 loop seems to be a bit more efficient. Yet I have a slightly different scenario in my problem, as I need to use the values in an array in the following example I use the function coderangecode for simplification. That is, if I collapse everything to a single loop I would have to create an extended array from the values of another array whose size is between 2 and 10 elements.p  precodeimport itertools import timeit  def case1n      b  [i  j  k for i, j, k in itertools.productrangen, repeat3]     c  0     for i in rangelenb         c  b[i]     return c  def case2n      c  0     for i in rangen         for j in rangen             for k in rangen                 c  ijk     return c  printcase110 printcase210  if name  main     import timeit      printtimeit.timeitcase110, setupfrom main import case1, number10000      printtimeit.timeitcase210, setupfrom main import case2, number10000 codepre  pIn my computer this code run inp  precode python3 code.py  91125 91125 2.435348572995281 1.6435037050105166 codepre  pSo it seems the 3 nested loops are more efficient because I spend sometime creating the array codebcode in codecase1code. so Im not sure Im creating this array in the most efficient way, but leaving that aside, does it really pay off collapsing loops to a single one Im using Python here, but what about compiled languages like C Does the compiler in this case do something to optimize the single loop Or on the other hand, does the compiler do some optimization when you have multiple nested loopsp

Negative 9002 pIve been working on a kernel module that simulates a page replacement algorithm. p  pIt consists of a number of page replacement algorithms FIFO, LRU, Clock, LFU that run concurrently each with its own view of main memory and each with its own page table. Only one algorithm emeffectivelyem runs, while the others continue to run on their view of memory, affecting their page tables. After a certain interval, a emswitcherem is called that compares the page fault counts of the algorithms for that interval and designates the one with the lowest page fault count as the emcurrentem algorithm. The idea is to try and dynamically switch to an algorithm that is performing better.p  pIve got the module up and running. It reads page access data from previously run programs which consists of pairs of the form virtual address, pid.p  pMy question is If I was to try and implement this scheme in the Linux Kernel, where would be a good place to start Ive been going through a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgdocgormanhtmlunderstand relnofollowMel Gormans booka but have only gone through the first couple of chapters. Could you suggest some other resources that maybe helpful for this particular endeavorp  pEDIT Sorry, this is a very broad question. Could you point out the specific parts of the memory manager I would need to look intop

But if I use codepointercode and I think the compiler does not copy arrays, vectors and other large data structures  it implicitly works with pointers, the situation changes.p  pIn codefoocode I allocate memory for vector and create pointer to it codevec2code. Then, I create second pointer to this memory sector codevec1code and immediately delete pointer codevec2code because function codefoocode was ended.p  pOn the second iteration of the codewhilecode, I allocate a new sector of memory in codefoocode and change pointer codevec1code to this area.p  pSo, what happened with that first allocate sector I didnt make it free on any step. But I dont see any leak when I watch memory the used by the process.p
Negative 9002 pIm creating a RESTful API with Yii2 and have successfully setup a model named Contacts by following the Quick Start Tutorial. I love how records can be created, listed, updated and deleted without creating any actions. p  pHowever I cant see how to filter results. I would like to only return contacts where contact.userid is equal to 1 for example as it currently will reply with all records. Is this possible without creating the actions p  pI am unsure also how I can limit results. From what Ive read I feel it should append the URI with limit5.p  ul lia hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comdoc2.0guiderestquickstart.html relnofollowhttpwww.yiiframework.comdoc2.0guiderestquickstart.htmlali ul

Negative 9002 pIm new in this area and a little bit confused about my current thoughts on a webservice implementation for my application. I want to synchronize all connected clients with the current data on a MySQL DB. I came up to use webservices as for coordination purposes, but I got stuck.p  pThe way I tried to implement it is...p  pThe webservice is running a deamon to checklisten on CRUD operations affecting DB data. Once an CRUD operation has been occured it undetakes to notify all the connected clients and each client in turn refreshes the JTable with current DB data and informs the user with the change that took place on the DB.p  pThis is where Im stuck...p  pThe way Im thinking its maybe wrong, since conceptually webservices are awaiting for client requests and then send him the corresponding response. But here, there is no client requests. The webservice just sends a response noification, which must multicast since its unaware of a calling client theres no request.p  pTherefore, in order a client to send a request it must cron all the time the webservice if a change on the DB has been occured. Then the webservice responts as true or false with the CRUD details CRUDEventFiredeventtype, eventdetails. But, this is not optimal as it will create big and much of time useless traffic especially when there is no CRUD operation occured. Also, there will be two different deamons one in webservice and the other in clientapp that checklisten for the same type of event and thats redundant.p  pAlso, with that implementation it seems that theres no need for a webservice at all and the code to check the DB for changes could be implemented in the client. On the other hand setting the client responsible for the DB changes would require to code the same functions in different platforms desktop, ios, android, etc, while setting the webservice as the coordinator for data synchronization between clients would require to code only once the appropriate function and each client simply implement its own NotificationListener.p  pIs it wrong the way Im thinking using webservices How it should be changed Do I even need to use webservicesp  pI attach my diagram for your convinience.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comBioL2.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBioL2.png altdiagramap

Negative 9002 pSo I have been creating a timer in javascript. It counts down from five minutes and changes colors on certain intervals of time.

Negative 9002 pIm working on a ecommerce project. I would like the customers of the ecommerce site to be able to add items to the shopping cart and checkout without having to login.p  pTo do this, I have decided to store the items that the customers would like to add to the shopping cart inside a Collection. e.g.p  precodeCartItems  new Mongo.Collectioncartitems codepre  pIn order to differentiate this customers shopping cart items from other customers, I have decided to add a extra fieldp  precode var sessid  Meteor.defaultconnection.lastSessionId codepre  pe.g.p  precode     id  HCo7JYsaruYBNQuC9,     qty  1,     productid  hAajzGxpLK4zJ3pXW,     session  uqTiaeqiawsxLMu7A  codepre  pto the document added to the CartItems collection.p  pThe problem with this solution is that whenever the page is REFRESHED, the last session Id changes and therefore the cart becomes empty again even though the same user is still using the page.p  pAlso, the documents added to the Collection does not get cleaned up deleted as I have no way of detecting if the session is going to be ended by the browseruser.p  p1. Whats the ideal solution to this problemp  p2. How do I implement the shopping cart for it to know that even though the page has been refreshed the user using the site is most likely the same person and therefore it should still keep the same items in the shopping cart  With my current solution of using session ids to differentiate one cart item from another seems to be not the suitable solution for this...p  p3.  With my current solution of using last session ids, the Collection will eventually be full of cart items with session ids from the past and I would like to provide a automatic cleanup functionality within the app for this.  Whats the best way to do this cleanup Is there a way to detect an end of sessionp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 9002 pWhile going through the book by Dennis Ritchie , I found that it is better to storing the value returned by codegetcharcode function in C in integer type variable rather than character type variable.

While implementing it practically, there was no such difficult in storing the return in char type variable. And What does getchar function originally returns , the charcter or the ascii value of the characterp

Hence, the interp1 command gives an error since some values in the Y vector are repeated.p  pTherefore, my question is How do I recognize and subsequently interpolate non monotonic increasing data automatically in Matlab.  p  pHere is a sample data setp  precode 0.999974    0.002176  0.994846    0.002555  0.984945    0.003283  0.973279    0.004131  0.960914    0.005022  0.948350    0.005919  0.935739    0.006810  0.923111    0.007691  0.910478    0.008564  0.897850    0.009428  0.885229    0.010282  0.872617    0.011125  0.860009    0.011960  0.847406    0.012783  0.834807    0.013598  0.822210    0.014402  0.809614    0.015199  0.797021    0.015985  0.784426    0.016764  0.771830    0.017536  0.759236    0.018297  0.746639    0.019053  0.734038    0.019797  0.721440    0.020531  0.708839    0.021256  0.696240    0.021971  0.683641    0.022674  0.671048    0.023367  0.658455    0.024048  0.645865    0.024721  0.633280    0.025378  0.620699    0.026029  0.608123    0.026670  0.595552    0.027299  0.582988    0.027919  0.570436    0.028523  0.557889    0.029115  0.545349    0.029697  0.532818    0.030265  0.520296    0.030820  0.507781    0.031365  0.495276    0.031894  0.482780    0.032414  0.470292    0.032920  0.457812    0.033415  0.445340    0.033898  0.432874    0.034369  0.420416    0.034829  0.407964    0.035275  0.395519    0.035708  0.383083    0.036126  0.370651    0.036530  0.358228    0.036916  0.345814    0.037284  0.333403    0.037629  0.320995    0.037950  0.308592    0.038244  0.296191    0.038506  0.283793    0.038733  0.271398    0.038920  0.259004    0.039061  0.246612    0.039153  0.234221    0.039188  0.221833    0.039162  0.209446    0.039064  0.197067    0.038889  0.184693    0.038628  0.172330    0.038271  0.159986    0.037809  0.147685    0.037231  0.135454    0.036526  0.123360    0.035684  0.111394    0.034690  0.099596    0.033528  0.088011    0.032181  0.076685    0.030635  0.065663    0.028864  0.055015    0.026849  0.044865    0.024579  0.035426    0.022076  0.027030    0.019427  0.019970    0.016771  0.014377    0.014268  0.010159    0.012029  0.007009    0.010051  0.004650    0.008292  0.002879    0.006696  0.001578    0.005207  0.000698    0.003785  0.000198    0.002434  0.000000    0.001190  0.000000    0.000000  0.000258   0.001992  0.000832   0.003348  0.001858   0.004711  0.003426   0.005982  0.005568   0.007173  0.008409   0.008303  0.012185   0.009379  0.017243   0.010404  0.023929   0.011326  0.032338   0.012056  0.042155   0.012532  0.052898   0.012742  0.064198   0.012720  0.075846   0.012533  0.087736   0.012223  0.099803   0.011837  0.111997   0.011398  0.124285   0.010925  0.136634   0.010429  0.149040   0.009918  0.161493   0.009400  0.173985   0.008878  0.186517   0.008359  0.199087   0.007845  0.211686   0.007340  0.224315   0.006846  0.236968   0.006364  0.249641   0.005898  0.262329   0.005451  0.275030   0.005022  0.287738   0.004615  0.300450   0.004231  0.313158   0.003870  0.325864   0.003534  0.338565   0.003224  0.351261   0.002939  0.363955   0.002680  0.376646   0.002447  0.389333   0.002239  0.402018   0.002057  0.414702   0.001899  0.427381   0.001766  0.440057   0.001656  0.452730   0.001566  0.465409   0.001496  0.478092   0.001443  0.490780   0.001407  0.503470   0.001381  0.516157   0.001369  0.528844   0.001364  0.541527   0.001368  0.554213   0.001376  0.566894   0.001386  0.579575   0.001398  0.592254   0.001410  0.604934   0.001424  0.617614   0.001434  0.630291   0.001437  0.642967   0.001443  0.655644   0.001442  0.668323   0.001439  0.681003   0.001437  0.693683   0.001440  0.706365   0.001442  0.719048   0.001444  0.731731   0.001446  0.744416   0.001443  0.757102   0.001445  0.769790   0.001444  0.782480   0.001445  0.795173   0.001446  0.807870   0.001446  0.820569   0.001446  0.833273   0.001446  0.845984   0.001448  0.858698   0.001448  0.871422   0.001451  0.884148   0.001448  0.896868   0.001446  0.909585   0.001443  0.922302   0.001445  0.935019   0.001446  0.947730   0.001446  0.960405   0.001439  0.972917   0.001437  0.984788   0.001441  0.994843   0.001441  1.000019   0.001441 codepre  pFirst column is X and the second column is Y.

Negative 9002 pI am working my way through Java  A beginners guide by Herbert Schildt. I hope this question is not way too ridiculous. It is about a while loop condition, where the while loop is located inside a for loop. The code example is this onep  precodepublic static void mainString[] args       int e     int result      for int i  0 i lt 10 i           result  1         e  i          while e gt 0               result  2             e                      System.out.println2 to the   i   power is   result           codepre  pI dont understand the decrementing of e, within the scope that is written after codewhile e gt 0code. Since e  i, and i is incremented, i believe e should be larger than 0 after the for loop has been performed the first time. If e is not decremented, the program will not run properly. Why is decrementing e necessary in this examplep

These are irrelevant for this question as all the namespace prefix declarations are unique and my goal is only to move them higher in the tree.p  pIve reviewed the MSDN documentation for XML but there doesnt seem to be a simple way to manipulate namespaces like this. One of the solutions Ive tried is interacting with the XML as an XElement and collecting the namespaces based on XAttribute.IsNamespaceDeclaration, replacing each element with its local name and finally creating a new root element with the collected list of namespace XAttributes. That line of experimentation caused a bunch of errors about redefining prefixes, though, and Im not sure if Im moving in the right direction or not.p

Negative 9002 pI am trying to write an algorithm that operates on a grid. It is similar to Dijkstras algorithm, but slightly different.p  pEach point in the grid is either occupied or free. I want to examine ALL of the reachable points that are less than a certain distance away from a starting point.p  pI am assuming that I can travel parallel to the grid lines or diagonally at a cost of 1 and sqrt2, respectively.p  pThe easiest way to do this would be if I had a map that was sorted by value. This way I could set the key to be the coordinates of each point, and the value to be the sofar calculated distance to the point. I would just have to pop the entry with the smallest distance and then find and update the sofar distance of the neighbors points.p  pSuch a container doesnt exist, so Ive been thinking about which containers I could combine in order to give me the same behavior, but I am having trouble coming up with anything that works.p  pI was thinking that I could have an unorderedset or unorderedmap which allow for fast retrievable of sofar distances for each point. For the unorderedset I could defined a gridNode object which contains both location and sofar distance of the point.p  pThen, I could have a vector that I would sort and use to find the shortest distance.p  pI am just not sure how to keep these two containers consistent. Would the vector contain pointers to the entries in the unorderedset Could the vector contain the coordinates of the grid points and I could write stdsort so that it uses the unorderedmap to sort correctlyp  pAny thoughts on this would be appreciated.p

This state codeobjectcode is passed to the codeBegincode API, but in the APM pattern, the state codeobjectcode is for private use by the caller.  So, it shouldnt matter what state codeobjectcode is passed to the codeBegincode API by codeFromAsynccode.p  pThe MSDN article linked above has a section titled Providing Custom State Data which recommends capturing any required state in a continuation delegate and passing codenullcode for the state object to codeFromAsynccode.  However, this does not explain why the codeFromAsynccode methods require a state object to be given.p  pWhy is a state codeobjectcode required to be passed when it is not accessible to the returned codeTaskltTResultgtcodep

I know it would be better to use a nuget solution rather than a folder of shared binaries, but this legacy project environment wont allow that.p  pThe problem that we have is that some other versions of these shared binaries already exist on engineers machines installed into the GAC I assume. Consequently when they add a reference they occasionally choose the system GAC instance rather than the project instance.p  pThen when we deploy to the remote targets that dont have their GAC version of the DLL installed, the applicationweb page doesnt work.p  pIve seen how references are added to the codecsprojcode XML file but I dont quite recognize how to determine if the reference will result in a GAC or not.p  pIs there a method in Visual Studio to determine if the DLL is coming from the GAC or from our shared library folder If not within Visual Studio, is there a VS command line options for this How about a way to conclusively recognize this in the code.slncode or code.csprojcode filesp

Sometimes it takes over a minute for the app to receive the ping message, sometimes it responds immediately. I dont understand why it is so random. Sometimes this undesired behaviour starts after mere minutes in standby mode, sometimes it goes alright for a while but breaks after 20 minutes, sometimes all messages from the server arrive at once as soon as I unlock the device.  p  pPush notifications and voip push notifications could be a solution, but they are also slightly unreliable.

Negative 9002 pIm writing Karma to test some AngularJS code. In order for the tests to run correctly, certain modules have to be run before others. Controllers and services come after the module instantiation.p  pThe way my code is structured right now grossly simplified is I have an app folder which contains another folder called controllers.p  pInside app, I have an app.js file.
