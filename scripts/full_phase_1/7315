Positive 7315 pI have to use this exact XSD, so no changes are possible. I could narrow down my problem to the following codelocalisationNameTypecode.  When publishing the webservice without the codelocalisationNameTypecode all works fine and soapUI can generate a request. When adding the type it simply makes an empty project. Accessing by browser the wsdl can be opened. It is no proxyproblem because I ran it on the localhost.p  pI also tried with soap 1.2 and 1.1 so that cause can be excluded as well.  When trying to create a codeWeb Service Clientcodeout of the Eclipse Wizard Axis I also get an error message which tells mep  precodeIWAB0399E Error in generating Java from WSDL  java.io.IOException Element httpwww.ech.chxmlnseCH01293localisationDescriptionIndex is referenced but not defined. codepre  pWhen removing the codelocalisationDescriptionIndexcode it simply takes the next field as invalid with the same error codeexception.

Positive 7315 pthe last days I was looking for an solution for my jaxb problem, but it was not successfully... So I hope that maybe someone here could help me. p  pThe base is an xsd schema from an external partner that is as is, i.e. I can not change it. The classes are generated with xjc without problems, but the enums are not java compatible.  Some of the values are nummeric or alphanumeric so that it was neccessary to set the attribute typesafeEnumMemberNamegenerateName in the binding. p  pJaxb generates then the enum keys like VALUE1, VALUE2 and so on. My problem is now, that some of the enums have lt 250 entries and only the javadoc of the entries says information about the value.  That is not realy comfortable and can force errors because the value VALUE1 of the following MandatType enum has the value E and not 1.... xsdp  precodeltxsdsimpleType nameMandatTypegt     ltxsdannotationgt         ltxsddocumentationgt     ltxsdannotationgt     ltxsdrestriction basexsdstringgt         ltxsdmaxLength value1gt         ltxsdminLength value1gt         ltxsdenumeration valueEgt             ltxsdannotationgt                 ltxsddocumentationgtErinnerungltxsddocumentationgt             ltxsdannotationgt         ltxsdenumerationgt         ltxsdenumeration value1gt             ltxsdannotationgt                 ltxsddocumentationgtKlageltxsddocumentationgt             ltxsdannotationgt         ltxsdenumerationgt         ltxsdenumeration value2gt             ltxsdannotationgt                 ltxsddocumentationgtBeschaffungltxsddocumentationgt             ltxsdannotationgt         ltxsdenumerationgt         ltxsdenumeration valueZgt             ltxsdannotationgt                 ltxsddocumentationgtStornoltxsddocumentationgt              ltxsdannotationgt         ltxsdenumerationgt     ltxsdrestrictiongt ltxsdsimpleTypegt codepre  pclassp  precodeXmlTypename  MandatType XmlEnum public enum MandatType             Erinnerung                   XmlEnumValueE     VALUE1E,             Klage                  XmlEnumValue1     VALUE21,             Beschaffung                  XmlEnumValue2     VALUE32,             Storno                  XmlEnumValueZ     VALUEZZ,      ...  codepre  pThe only solution I have found is to define for each enum value in the binding the enum key.

Positive 7315 pIn my Java Maven project Im using a hrefhttpsjaxb.java.net relnofollowJAXB 2.2.11a to rebuild instances of a class from an XML payload received by our servers.

I do like having the functionality of said a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comschemaelall.asp relnofollowcodexsallcodea tagp  blockquote   pThe all element specifies that the child elements can appear in any   order and that each child element can occur zero or one time.p blockquote  pHowever, I dont want to get a parsing error while processing an XML payload that contains extra attributes.

Also, the way codeJAXBcode treats the codeanycode or the codeanyAttributecode is very interesting, because it puts all the unknown nodes into a map, so I can log it saying emHey We are receiving an attribute that we dont really care about as of now, but maybe youll find it somehow useful in the futureemp  pIve read about a hrefhttpsxsom.java.net relnofollowXsoma, that supports XSD 1.1, but apparently, it doesnt return an eminstanceem of the class you want, but more generic set of hashmaps and lists, therefore losing my type checking, which is something I dont want to.p  pSo...

Positive 7315 pAs in question I need to differentiate in JAXB code on the server side when in SOAP message optional enum field is not present and when optional enum field is present, but with wrong value.

How do you override the way saxSource or xmlReader looks up the entities so it will go to the ones I have stored in memoryp  pEDIT Just to be clear, SAX isnt a requirement for this project, but JAXB is.  So stripping SAX out in favor of something else will be just as good as long as its faster.p

Negative 7315 pAre they any helpful guidelines to describing what a Turing machine does if you already have the pseudo code for the algorithmp  pIm taking a course on complexity theory and it takes me a while to describe a Turing machine that decides or accepts some language states, transitions, etc. even though I know how I could code it in something like C or even assembly. I guess I just havent had enough practice with Turing machines working on it, but I appreciate any suggestions.p  pstrongeditstrongp  pI dont want to make a Turing Machine simulator, I want to describe a Turing Machine on paper alphabet, states, transitions for deciding some language.p  pHeres a trivial example of what I mean, say I need to write a Turing Machine that goes over a string of 0s and 1s and changes all the 0s in it to 1s. For example, if you start with 11010 on the tape input it halts with 11111 on the tape output. Now in a high level language you know its something likep  precodeGo over every character on tape     If character is 0 change it to 1 codepre  pThe Turing machine description is informally something likep  blockquote   pYou have two states, q and halt. When   you are on state q and you see a 1, go   to the right without changing it. If   you see a 0, change it to 1 and go to   the right. If you see the blank symbol   end of tape then go to the halt   state.p blockquote  pFormally you will have something like q, halt for states. q, 1  q, 1, R, q, 0  q, 1, R, q,   halt, 0, L for transitions.p  pNow this problem is trivial, but there are others which are more involving add unary numbers or recognize a language with equal number of as, bs, and cs. I could easily write the pseudocode for them, but writing the Turing Machine is far more challenging takes me a long time and I was wondering if there were some tips, resources, or guidelines that help me become better at solving problems like that.p

Sometimes, however, my pictures are narrow and high, so the thumb can have unclickable dimensions of like 5x80.

Negative 7315 pThis is a specific gcc related question. I have a library compiled with g 4.1.2 that I want to give the user. The user can use our API in their code and link our library to create the final executable.p  pThe question I have is related to g version compatibility. Some of our users are using g 4.4.3, others 4.3.3, and still others 4.2.1. Is the library compiled with 4.1.2 compatible with all these g versions My guess is they should be because they are ABI compatible. But some of our customers dont agree. I really dont want to ship four different versions of the same library. If they are incompatible is there a concrete reason or is there a way to avoid the incompatibilityp
Negative 7315 pI recently discovered WebSockets and their possible usage in my project. Currently, I use raw web sockets, but I have been exploring the possibility of making a custom transport bindingchannel that would handle everything and allow me to host it in IIS.p  pIve started work on this, but Im having issues figuring out how to get IIS to forward the appropriate requests to me. Ive been reading through the UDP transport example from Microsoft, but it doesnt host it the same way I do, so its not very useful in that regard. The example creates a UDP Socket in the WCF code itself, which doesnt seem like the proper way to do it. I could make my binding manually create a port to listen to, but then Id have to reimplement things that are covered by IISASP.NET.p  pAs a WebSocket starts out as a normal HTTP request then escalates to a protocol similar to HTTP, I need to get IIS to give me a stream that I can read from and write to.p  pIve been using .NET Reflector to look through the webHttpBinding to see how they do it. They seem to use httpapi.dll to PInvoke HttpCreateRequestQueue. Is this what I wantp  pThis is very similar to the webBindingSocket in the way that it generates client proxy JavaScript, but I will automatically generate callback methods to allow the server to easily invoke methods on the browser.p  pExamplebr  http localhostWebSocket.svc  Service Metadata Stuffbr  http localhostWebSocket.svcjsdebug  JavaScript Client Proxybr  http localhostWebSocket.svcstream  Where the WebSocket is locatedp  pIm sorry if my question seems confusing, but Ive just been staring at tons of code trying to figure out how it works. Basically I want to make it easier to use WebSockets in my code, instead of having to worry about serializing messages tofrom the server and calling the right method, Im going to handle all that in WCF.p  pThanksp

Negative 7315 pI have a data model in Doctrinesymfony. I have a Course which has many Lessons. For each lesson I need to calculate the order by date that the lesson appears. For example, the Course Java for beginners might have 10 lessons during October, I need to retrieve the order of these lessons so that the first one is called Java for beginners 1 etc.p  pCurrently I have a getTitle method in my Lesson model that queries the database to establish the number. This works fine. However, when there are 400 lessons on screen this is a typical use case it results in 400 queries.p  pI have read about Doctrine behaviours and as I understand it, I could add a behaviour for each time a lesson is added, edited or deleted I can recalculate all the sequence numbers  storing them in the database.

Negative 7315 pI have a DataGridView that I am binding to a POCO.  I have the databinding working fine.  However, I have added a combobox column that I want to be different for each row.  Specifically, I have a grid of purchased items, some of which have sizes like Adult XL, Adult L and other items are not sized like Car Magnet. p  pSo essentially what I want to change is the DATA SOURCE for a combobox column in the data grid.  Can that be done p  pWhat event can I hook into that would allow me to change properties of certain columns FOR EACH ROW  An acceptable alternative is to change a property when the user clicks or tabs into the row.  What event is that p  pSethp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I need more help with this question.   With Triduses help I am SO close but I need a bit more information.   p  pFirst, per the question, is the CellFormatting event really the bestonly event for changing the DataSource for a combo box column.  I ask because I am doing something rather resourcedata intensive, not merely formatting the cell.p  pSecond, the cellformatting event is being called just by having the mouse hover over the cell.  I tried to set the FormattingApplied property inside my strongifblockstrong and then I check for it in the strongif teststrong but that is returning a weird error message.   My ideal situation is that I would apply change the data source for the combo box once for each row and then be done with it.p  pFinally, in order to set the data source of the combobox colunm I have to be able to cast the Cell inside my if block to a type of DataGridViewComboBoxColumn so that I can fill it with rows or set the datasource or something.   Here is the code I have right now. p  precodePrivate Sub ProductsDataGridCellFormattingByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs Handles ProductsDataGrid.CellFormatting      If e.ColumnIndex  ProductsDataGrid.ColumnsSizeDGColumn.Index Then  AndAlso Not e.FormattingApplied Then         Dim product As LeagueOrderProductInfo  DirectCastProductsDataGrid.Rowse.RowIndex.DataBoundItem, LeagueOrderProductInfo         Dim sizes As LeagueOrderProductSizeList  product.ProductSizes         sizes.RemoveSizeFromListparentOrderDetail.SizeID          WHAT DO I DO HERE TO FILL THE COMBOBOX COLUMN WITH THE sizes collection.

Negative 7315 pI havent found any information on MSDN regarding this problem.p  pIf we create an codeExpressionltFuncltTgtgtcode and call codeCompilecode on it does CLR cache compiled results, so any subsequent calls of codeCompilecode on the same expression wouldnt have much impact because CLR would return previously compiled codeFuncltTgtcode from internal memory cache p  pAFAIK lambda expressions are immutable, so internal caching would actually make sense.p

Negative 7315 pI am working on a script to translate an old Rails 2 application database into a new Rails 3 application.  The new application is a rewrite and simplification of the database schema.p  pI have created a standalone ruby program independent of Rails to do the heavy lifting and am leveraging the adapter pattern with Ruby modules to manipulate two database connections and move the data from one system to the other. p  pI have successfully implemented ActiveRecord using include activerecord in my translator models and all my find and validations are working as expected.

Negative 7315 pI have a series of images within a ViewController.p  pI am floating them by transforming their individual layersp  precodeimg.layer.transform  CATransform3DMakeTranslation0.0f, 0.0f, myZ codepre  pThis gives the effect of making the layers float above the screen  in the Simulator, there would be no visible effect which is correct.p  pWhat I want to do is have an effect where moving a device leftrightforwardor back would make it look subtly like the layers are floating.  When you tilt the device to the left, it should angle the entire view to the right.  This will make it feel like moving the device lets you see around corners  i.e. it will give a feeling that the images really are floating above the screen, because they would move at different rates based on their zindex.p  pI have made a test project a hrefhttppushplay.netmediademofloatdemofloatdemo.zipproject file herea which has a sample project that demos this.p  pMy problem is that I am not a math person, so I am struggling with the best way to simulate the subtle floating effect.

I am hoping to extend this to something a friend and I are working on with face detection so it would move the parent view based on the movement of a persons face  even while they keep the phonedevice perfectly still.p  pI realize I will get people answering just use OpenGL.  Thats not the answer I need  unless you post a chunk of code that shows how to integrate it within this project.  Im not looking for new problems to solve.  p  pAgain, the full project is here a hrefhttppushplay.netmediademofloatdemofloatdemo.zipiphone floating viewsa for anyone who would like to see the effect as it is right now.

Negative 7315 pI am in the process of designing my data access code, the data is going to be stored in RavenDB, and I am trying to see if my current design has too much abstraction with the number of interfaces I am going to have.p  pI am going to have DTOs that will just hold the data and then I am going to have Entity or Model, Business, or whatever you call them objects that will have extra functionality.  I am also going to have an interface per entity defining what data it needs to have.  So for examplep  precodeinterface IUser      string Id  get      string Username  get      string Password  get      bool ResetPassword  get    class UserDTO  IUser      public string Id  get set      public string Username  get set      public string Password  get set       public UserDTO              Id  null         Username  null         Password  null         ResetPassword  false        class User  IUser      public string Id  get set      public string Username  get set      public string Password  get set       public User              Id  null         Username  null         Password  null         ResetPassword  false           public UserIUser user              Id  user.Id         Username  user.Username         Password  user.Password         ResetPassword  user.ResetPassword           public ResetPassword              Id  null         Username  null         Password  null       codepre  pThe reason I want to have an interface for each entity is because I want to make sure the both codeEntityDTOcode and codeEntitycode have the required shared data.p  pNow for retrieving and saving the data, I am going to use the repository pattern.  I am going to have one generic interface called codeIDataRepositorycode and then each entity is going to have is own repository interface.  For examplep  precodeinterface IDataRepositoryltTgt      bool SaveT entity     bool DeleteT entity   interface IUserRepository  IDataRepositoryltIUsergt      IUser Loadstring key     IUser LoadByLoginstring username, string password   class UserRepository  IUserRepository      bool SaveT entity              save code           bool DeleteT entity              delete code           IUser Loadstring key              load code           IUser LoadByLoginstring username, string password              load code       codepre  pThe reason I want to have a repository interface for each entity is so that I can if I need to use different data storage options for different entities.p  pDo this seem like too much abstractionp

Negative 7315 pWhat Im looking for is a TestRunner implementation for running a suite of Java JUnit tests within a browser.  The intention is that nondevelopers can execute the tests by visiting a browser page.  Test results should be dynamically updated to the browser page with something like AJAX after each test andor suite has completed. p  pIve seen a few attempts at this, but the ones Im aware of execute all of the tests before showing any results to the browser.  Take a hrefhttpmistletoe.qos.chmanual.html relnofollowmistletoea for example.p  pIdeally, the implementation would be inspired by the JUnit testrunners found in IDEs such as a hrefhttpwww.jetbrains.comideaindex.html relnofollowIntelliJ IDEAa or a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.org relnofollowEclipsea.

Negative 7315 pIm working on this method which deals with collision detection. Im having an issue with the direction bool being initialized to true. Sometimes, when firing an object, the angle is reversed, because its expecting the bool to be false.  p  pIf the object is initially aimed towards the left between 0 and 350 in my code, the bool should be true. If its aimed towards the right between 350 and 700, the bool should be false.p  pHow can I set the initial bool to the appropriate truefalse value without interfering with subsequent collision detectionp  pI think the problem is when I try to check what the direction should be then set it, Im inadvertently imposing constraints onto the objects. I cant figure out how to separate the two. Ideally, the between 0 and 350 check, and the between 350 and 700 check should only happen once, but they are being checked every time the method is called and this is causing the issue.p  precodeMove bubble     public void MoveBubbleBubble bubble, Vector2 distance              if bubble.stop  false                      velocityX  speed  distance.X             velocityY  speed  distance.Y              bubble.X  velocityX              Problem section             if bubble.Y gt 0 ampamp bubble.Y lt 350                 direction  true              if bubble.Y gt 350 ampamp bubble.Y lt 700                 direction  false             End Problem section              if direction  true                 bubble.Y  velocityY              if direction  false                 bubble.Y  velocityY              if bubble.Y lt 0  bubble.Y gt 350                 direction  direction                   codepre  pFixed codep  precode    Move bubble and reverse its velocity if it collides with a wall     internal void MoveBubbleBubble bubble, Vector2 distance              if bubble.stopped  false             if bubble.Y lt 0  bubble.Y gt 350                 bubble.velocityY  bubble.velocityY              bubble.Y  bubble.velocityY             bubble.X  bubble.velocityX      codepre

Negative 7315 pIn the past I have used asp.nets built in Resource files for handling localization. Its worked pretty well and we find it easy to use and maintain in our business.p  pThere is one big drawback though  our clients support teams cant update the resource files themselves. We have a big project starting soon and the option to allow the external support team manage localization is a main requirement. Up until now we have had clients just contact us, we get the piece translated and then roll the updated resx file to the live server.p  pI know that updating a resx file causes the application to recompile and I dont like the idea of allowing non techies download and mess around with a resx file not to mention having the site uncompiled in a live environment so Im wondering if there are any other options available to us other than going down the database routep  pIf we do have to build this type of localization functionality into a few database tables, does anyone have any good templates for starting offp  pNot sure if it helps knowing or not but the site were talking about building here would be localized into about 15 different languages including chineese and arabic. The translations would be applied onto the aspx pages and in the XML that would leave our system to third parties.p

Negative 7315 pI just want to know if my thoughts concerning REST are right. Lets imagine we have a shopping site. With a conventional approach the shopping cart would be stored in the users session so that the server has to manage many items for user User1 item1, item2, item3 User2 itemA,itemB, item3,.... So the server has to have lots of memorycomputing power if there are more than thousand users browsing on the site and adding items to their shopping cart.p  pIn a REST approach there is no session, so the client has all information about the items in the shopping cart. This means that the server doesnt need to have such big memory requirements and i can easily scale this. p  pNow if I add an item in the nonRESTapproach to the shopping cart it would it would go directly in the session. If I add an item in the RESTapproach I have to update the entity in the database shoppingcart1234 and this would take a bit longer since I have to go one level deeper clientserverdatabase. p  pIs this correct so far or am I missing or misunderstanding a pointp

Negative 7315 pIve just implemented an interface with a third party payment service, for subscriptions to the site Im busy with.  The service is called emPayFastem, sort of like a local PayPal.  I am currently saddled with umpteen items in my strongAppSettingsstrong config node with keys prefixed with PayFast, so Im exploring options to factor these out of the main web.config file.p  pThe simplest that comes to mine is to use an external .config file for these service specific settings, but this is cumbersome and Im constrained by the keyvalue structure of the emaddem elements.  I would rather implement a custom section handler, section group, and sections, for each payment service I plan to add PayPal later as well, and possibly more.p  pHow should I structure this custom section handling so I can have multiple sections, one for local mocking of the service, one for online testing of the service, one for live use of the service etc.  I think the outermost element should have attributes that determine which one of the inner sections to use, mock, test etc.  I dont have much trouble doing this in XML, and maybe a tool that could generate handlers from XML would be useful.p  pAs an added bonus, I would ideally like the top level structures for each payment service to be grouped in a general PaymentServiceProviders node as well, but that is mere wishful thinking at the moment.p

Obviously, this means that the ListView will always be 280dip, but is there a way to make it so that the ListView can change its size so it can always fit the button below it no matter the screen sizedimensions I dont want to fill the parent of the height in the dialog because I dont want the dialog to be stretched out all the way in portrait mode. Im sure there is a simple solution to this, but I wasnt sure how to word it in a manner that was more general.p

Negative 7315 pDo Oracle VARCHAR2 types interpret any kind of escape sequences Im working with a system that has a UI that contains a date of birth field, but the DB saves it as a VARCHAR2. Were seeing strange text in this field on the database side letters such as FF, B, EG that seem inexplicable. The date field can take date values such as 8AUG2011 or lines of numbers such as 121234. These get converted into dates. The UI does not allow text such as FF or EG to be entered. So were a little confused as to how these are getting in the DB.p  pHas anyone seen a similar issuep

Below is the button code in the Test1 MXML Component filep  precodeltsButton idbtn1 labelButton1 clickcurrentState  State2gt codepre  pIn the MXML Application file I have 2 States called State1 amp State2.  I have added the following to this file as wellp  precodeltlocalTest1 includeInState1 x0 y0gtltlocalTest1gt ltlocalTest2 includeInState2 x0 y200gtltlocalTest2gt codepre  pI have also added the states to all 3 filesp  precodeltsstatesgt      ltsState nameState1gt     ltsState nameState2gt ltsstatesgt codepre  pWhen I run the application, I see Test1 as I would expect since State1 is the first state listed.  When I click the button in Test1 labeled Button1, I would expect it to now show the Test2 MXML component since I am changing the currentState to State2, but it does not.  Test1 is still displayed with Button1 showing.p  pCan someone shed some light as to what I am doing wrong  Or propose a better or proper way of doing thisp  pThanks in advancep

So the kernel sends out an ARP request. The application I am writing forwards the arp request via a raw socket on a physical eth device and gets an arp reply. This arp reply is forwarded back to the tap device, but the kernel refuses to accept this. If I add an arp entry manually, no arp request is generated and there is two way ip packet exchange mozilla is happy.p  pWireshark is able to receive the packet and finds no errors. Same is the case with ICMPv6 packets neighbor solicitation amp advertisement. Any application listening on the device gets the packet intact. But the kernel does not process it for ARPICMP.p  pMy question is, why doesnt the kernel accept the arp replyICMPv6 msgs Is there some ioctl call that we need to callp  pstrongEditstrongp  pHere is the details of packet captured tshark output at the tap device ethgressp  precode  9  16.548328    fc0012 gt ff021ff001 ICMPv6 86 Neighbor Solicitation  10  17.243247  fc001100 gt fc0012    ICMPv6 86 Neighbor Advertisement  11  17.548652    fc0012 gt ff021ff001 ICMPv6 86 Neighbor Solicitation  12  17.668736  fc001100 gt fc0012    ICMPv6 86 Neighbor Advertisement codepre  pThis is the ifconfig output for ethgressp  precodeethgress  Link encapEthernet  HWaddr 000102030405           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU1500  Metric1           RX packets0 errors0 dropped0 overruns0 frame0           TX packets83 errors0 dropped0 overruns0 carrier0           collisions0 txqueuelen10000           RX bytes0 0.0 b  TX bytes7062 6.8 KiB codepre  pAs can be seen, the kernel is refusing the accept the ICMPv6 packets as received. But the tx packets are incremented.p  pThe tap device ethgress is configured with IPv6 address fc0012 and it an application wants to communicate to fc0011. fc0011 is at the same interface as fc001100 which is responding with the neighbor advertisement the target ip is fc0011 in that packet with proper mac address. Tcpdump is able to capture it and wiresharktshark is able to decode it without and says its a properly formed packet. But Rx counters are not incremented by the kernel, nor does it update its arp cache. Same is the case with ARP packets.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pThe network looks like this. There are two external boxes which are configured to be redundant. Only one of them will be active. They are connected to a pc via a physical NIC each. The application I am writing runs on this pc and opens a raw socket on each of the NICs. It also opens a TAP device. The NICs are not configured with an IP address. The TAP device is configured with both IPv4 and IPv6 address. A standard application, say mozilla, opens a socket via the tap device and wants to connect to the active box. For that the kernel generates an ARP requestNeighbor solicitation message on the tap device. The application reads this message and forwards it to both the NICs. The active box responds to the ARP request with an ARP reply which the application reads and writes it to the TAP device. This arp reply packet is captured by tcpdump, but the kernel doesnt update its arp cache. The mac address of both NICs and the TAP device are the same.p  pOther parameters asked for.p  precodecat procsysnetipv4confalllogmartians 0 cat procsysnetipv4confallrpfilter 1 cat procsysnetipv4confallarpfilter 0 codepre

I am looking for information on how navigational properties are treated by EF 4.2 POCO.

Printing the typeid.name as seen in the code gave the possible explanationp  blockquote   poutofrange  FN4tags12outofrangeEvE p      pother exception  N4tags12outofrangeEp blockquote  pWe can see the names dont match, and if I understood it correctly, when the classes are in different modules the names are actually string compared for dynamic casting. p  pSo somewhere I then read try with adding fPIC, and suddenly it worked meaning i caught an outofrange exception, although printing the names still give the same result. I thought position independent code didnt matter any longer, and looking in the g man pages about fPICp  blockquote   pThis option makes a difference on the m68k, PowerPC and SPARCp blockquote  pAnd I use an x8664. I really dont see how code positioning could make any difference in this case Also, if the typeid names are string compared I thought I would still end up in the stdexception clause, as they are still different even with fPICp  pSo the question Why does fPIC make any differencep

Negative 7315 pMy overriding question is this  In Android codePreferenceActivitycode, how can I write an codeOnClickListenercode which will have the same functionality as pressing the Android back button as I navigate through codePreferenceScreencode defined menus  That is to say, I would like users of my App to explicity see a menu choice Back which will bring them to the previous menu, or bring them out of the menu activity to their previous activity if they are at the root of this particular codePreferenceActivitycode session.  p  pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidpreferencePreferenceActivity.html relnofollowandroid developer documents tell usa p  blockquote   pNote that this XML resource contains a preference screen holding another fragment, the Prefs1FragmentInner implemented here. This allows the user to traverse down a hierarchy of preferences pressing back will pop each fragment off the stack to return to the previous preferences.p blockquote  pAnd they are correct about that.  I navigate happily through my menus by clicking on codePreferenceScreencode items to get to that screen, and using the Android back button to go Back up a level.  But Im not sure a casual user really understands the Back button, I know I didnt until I read about it in Developer docs.  SO I would would like them to have an explicit codePreferencecode defined menu choice whos codeOnClickListenercode duplicates the function of the Android back button.  p  pSo I tried to put in a Preference in my menu that would go back.  Having determined that a not Overriden codeonBackPressedcode in a my subclass of codePreferenceActivitycode just referred back to codeActivity.onBackPressedcode which merely calls codefinishcode, I tried this codeOnClickListenercodep  precodeprivate OnPreferenceClickListener clickFinishesSuccessfully  new OnPreferenceClickListener      Override     public boolean onPreferenceClickPreference preference          finish         return true       codepre  pAs it turns out, this did NOT do the same thing as pressing the back button  Pressing this button always took me out of the codePreferenceActivitycode entirely, back to the codeActivitycode from which I had called my codePreferenceActivitycode.  Specifically, it did NOT navigate back through my menus no matter how deep I was when I clicked it.  p  pI am guessing here When I have gotten to a submenu by clicking an onscreen preference which is really a codePreferenceScreencode, I am no longer in my own codePreferenceActivitycode.  I must be in some other Activity  p  pSo my functional question what can I put in my OnClickListener of my Back codePreferencecode to get the same function as the Android Back button navigating through my menusp

Negative 7315 pIll need to expose a bit of background before going further I have a project that uses nHibernate and some generic repository to forward predicates and return entities as followsp  precodepublic abstract class GenericRepositorylt T gt  ...     public virtual T Single Expressionlt Funclt T, bool gt gt predicates                Get object from nHibernate session object         var retObj  Session             .Querylt T gt             .Where predicates .SingleOrDefault          return retObj      ...  codepre  pI can then for example get an entity this wayp  precodevar entity  Context.MyGenericEntityRepository.Single e gt e.Id  id   or var entity  Context.MyGenericEntityRepository.Single e gt e.Name  name  codepre  pBut, I also have some entities that because of the nature of the project arent saved to the database but to the file system bunch of files.

So when the solution is first started, I have a singleton called CustomDatabase that gets initialised, creates the DataTables in memory, adds relations between the DataTalbes, and adds them to a general DataSet before scanning the file system to populate the tables.p  pUsing this, I can now query my DataTables instead of scanning through the file system tree every time. I then set up some events in my CustomDatabase so whenever a row is addeddeletedupdated, the changes are reflected onto the file system.p  pSo... This is it for the background, sorry for the length...p  pMy question is now fairly simple, Im looking for a way to somehow translate the lambda expression forwarded by the repository to my DataAccess class, so I can then analyse it and select from my DataTables accordingly...p  pFor example, a call to the repository such asp  precodevar entity  Context.MyNotGenericEntityRepository.Single e gt e.Id  id   or var entity  Context.MyNotGenericEntityRepository.Single e gt e.Name  name  codepre  pShould be translated within the DataAccess asp  precodeDataRow entityRow  CustomDatabase.Tables[ EntityName ].AsEnumerable.Where e gt e.Fieldlt Guid gt Id   id  or DataRow entityRow  CustomDatabase.Tables[ EntityName ].AsEnumerable.Where e gt e.Fieldlt string gt Name   name codepre  pOrp  precodevar entity  from myRow in CustomDatabase.Tables[ EntityName ].AsEnumerable              where myRow.FieldltGuidgt Id   id              select myRow  or var entity  from myRow in CustomDatabase.Tables[ EntityName ].AsEnumerable              where myRow.Fieldltstringgt Name   name              select myRow codepre  pI have absolutely no idea how to do this, Ive been looking all over the net, but the problem is that I dont really know how to name this problem so I havent found much so far... p  pAny help is appreciated since Im expecting therell be several ways to tackle this problem p  pThanksp

So I want to create a enteredValuenotvalid exception class how do I do that I cant even think of how to do that, mainly because this is a seprate class itself and then the Jform is a seprate class so if error happens here then i have to get the exception from the enteredValuenotvalid class.p  pthe only thing I can think of is extending the enteredValuenotvalid class, or is there a better way to do that.p

Technically, there is no difference. If I may rephrase the wording of my question and eliminate the word semantic, then the new question has already been answered and elaborated upon here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma66459151268003httpstackoverflow.coma66459151268003ap  pstrongButstrong, the semantic part is my dilemma and what I hope this thread could shine some light on. Due to it being semantic, there can be no objective answer and my question is admittedly on the borderline of not being valid according to the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comfaqFAQa of Stackoverflow. However, I can argue for the validity of this question which just might happen in the comments. For now, lets move on.p  h2Defining the problemh2  pThe absolute vast strongmajoritystrong of all JavaScripters out there seems to use codeexample 2code. Actually, I havent yet found one exception to that rule or where have I been lately. jQuery plugin developers in particular, write code like sop  ul lipemExample 3em see a hrefhttpcoding.smashingmagazine.com20111011essentialjquerypluginpatterns relnofollowexample of an exampleap  pcodefunction   jQuerycodepli ul  pMy bible, a hrefhttpshop.oreilly.comproduct9780596805531.do relnofollowJavaScript The Definitive Guidea , doesnt use this practice at all  not once.

Then, may I ask, clarify whatp  h2My reasoningh2  pWhen writing a closure in JavaScript, were defining a local variable in a function that is not supposed to be accessible from code outside. For the most part and due to context, our function is an anonymous one that isnt bound to an identifier. Like sop  ul lipemExample 4emp  pcodefunction   var local  Local variable codepli ul  pAgain due to context and what is usually the practice, we want to execute that snippet of code at once. So we throw in a couple of parenthesis. This will tell the JavaScript interpreter to run the functionp  ul lipemExample 5emp  pcodefunction   codepli ul  pTo clarify this in code, best practice is to add a couple of parenthesis, in a way this also clarifies the closurep  ul lipemExample 6emp  pcodefunction   codepli ul  pThis is an exact replica of codeexample 1code. My reasoning thus gives that codeexample 1codeis the way we should write code. Whenever I choose to use codeexample 2code, I only clarify the use of a closure, not the fact that our anonymous function is executed at once. But by the smallest of efforts to place our clarificationparenthesis on the outside of the entire code snippet, we can catch both.p  pemYes I can critique my reasoningem. In codeexample 3code, I find it appealing to think hey, outside reference is copied to an alias on the inside. The alternativep  ul lipemExample 7emp  pcodefunction   jQuerycodepli ul  p..isnt as clear in this particular regard. However, codeexample 2code doesnt use this passbyvalue technique. Personally, for the most part when I write closures, I dont have to pass anything in. And still, if we are allowed to be fundamentalist about it, the jQuery plugin practice never clarifies the immediate execution of our anonymous function. p  h2Example 1 usersh2  pIf my reasoning holds true, why is it then that the entire community out there use codeexample 1code Is their sole intention to only cast one of two clarifications Maybe just maybe, they dont even have a purpose but are following the lead of a mere tradition of which purpose we might not be able to explain I havent yet written a jQuery plugin, or used codeexample 2code because I began my career reading the bible.

Negative 7315 pemShort versionemp  pWhat is the easiest way to make a branch equal to codemastercode again, discarding any differences Up until now, I simply used codegit branch D wipcode, followed by codegit checkout b wipcode, but that seems a bit silly. p  pemMotivationemp  pI often have a codewipcode branch alongside my codemastercode branch, for work in progress. Sometimes the work on such a branch gets left behind and when I rediscover it, I find I no longer want it. This rediscovery often happens when I want to use the branch to store a new set of work in progress and I find I simply want to discard any differences with codemastercode, so the new work in progress fits on top. Figuring out the differences is not worth the trouble the solution described above works fine for me. Any better solutions to address this use casep
Negative 7315 pIs there a way to force a class to be instantiated on the stack or at least prevent it to be global in Cp  pI want to prevent global instantiation because the constructor calls C APIs that need previous initialization. AFAIK there is no way to control the construction order of global objects.p  pEdit The application targets an embedded device for which dynamic memory allocation is also prohibited. The only possible solution for the user to instanciate the class is either on the stack or through a placement new operator.p  pEdit2 My class is part of a library which depends on other external libraries from which come the C APIs. I cant modify those libraries and I cant control the way libraries are initialized in the final application, thats why I am looking for a way to restrict how the class could be used.p

Negative 7315 pI am using the type expressionp  precodetype dbSchema  SqlDataConnectionltConnectionStringNameX1, ConfigFileApp.configgt codepre  pThis works great at compile time I have full access to all the db types, but it fails at run time. I presume its because the config file generated in the console applications codebincode directory is named something else, such as codeMyAppName.exe.configcode, and therefore the codeApp.configcode file is not found.p  pCertainly, for an emASP.NET MVCem type app that uses codeweb.configcode, theres no issue because the compile and runtime config filenames are the same.p  pFortunately, placing a duplicate codeApp.configcode in the codebincode directory does remediate the problem, but is that what we are expected to do Any thoughtsp

Negative 7315 pOur web app is being cached so aggressively in ios 6 app mode that the only file being requested from the web server every time is the cache manifest. We have changed a bunch of scripts and html, but the app never requests the new files. How can I fix this if nothing is requested from the web server Is there a way that I can fix this in the cache manifest Bear in mind that we are only using the cache manifest to cache images, fonts, etc and not the js itself. Any help would be much appreciated, Im stumpedp  pEdit 1p  pThe content of the cache manifest has changed. I even put a guid in the cache manifest each time just to ensure that it is different. Ive run charles and see that the page keeps requesting the manifest repeatedly, with 200 respone.. Seems to be something really weird going on with the ios 6 native app mode wrapper. p

In this case, it would be any i, j in all of North and South America minus any surrounding islands.p  pThe motivation behind this is that Im trying to implement an SIR infection model in c in parallel.p  pMany thanks for your help.p  pstrongEditstrong Id also be interested if there are any approximate methods Im not overly fussed if some tiny offshore islands were included by mistake., perhaps by a meshing method like quadtrees Thanks again.p
Negative 7315 pIm a C programmer and Im not familiar with the .NET database model. I usually use codeIDataReadercode codeOdbcDataReadercode, codeOledbDataReadercode or codeSqlDataReadercode to read data from database. Sometimes when I need a bulk of data I use codeDataAdaptercode, but what should I do to achieve the functionality of scrollable cursors that exists in native libraries like ODBC hr Thanks all of you for your answers, but I am in a situation that I cant accept them, of course this is my fault that didnt explain my problem completely. I explain it as a comment in one of answers that now removed.p  pI have to write a program that will act as a proxy between client side program and MSSQL, for this library I have following requirementsp  ul liMy program should be compatible with MSSQL2000li liI dont know all the tables and queries that will be sent by the user, I should simply add some information to it, make a log, ... and then execute it against MSSQL, so it is really hard to use techniques that based on ordered fields of the query or primary key of the tableAll my works are in one database but that database is huge and may change over time.li liOnly a part of data is needed by the client, most DBMS support codeLIMIT OFFSETcode, unfortunately codeMSSQLcode do not support it, and codeROWNUMBERcode does not exist in the codeMSSQL2000code and if it supported, then again I need to understand program logic and that need a parse of SQL commandActually I write a parsing library with codeboostspiritcode but thats native code and beside that Im not yet 100 sure about its functionality.li liI may have multiple clients but most of queries that will be sent by them are one of a few predefined queriesof course users still send custom queries but its about 30 of all queries, So I think I can open some scrollable cursors and respond to clients using that cursors and a custom cache.li liServer machine and its codeMSSQLcode will be dedicated to my program, so I really want to use all of the power of the server and DBMS to achieve my functionality.li ul  pSo nowp  ul liWhat is the problem in using scrollable cursors and why I should avoid themli liHow can I use scrollable cursors in .NETli ul

Negative 7315 pThe sort of classic Springs and Struts, aka Anchor and Align, or Autosizing masks is the only sort of resizemanagement I understand.  However in XCode 4.6, autolayout using constraints as introduced in iOS 6, is the default, and it makes certain simple things harder, while making a whole world of new arrangements possible, once you learn how.  emTo be clear, some users might only care to get a simple view working without fighting autolayout battles, so a workaround was suggested early on by Matt, of turning off Autolayout, which is reproduced  belowemp  piOS 6 Layout Constraints, the Interface Builder system of editing constraints, I do not understand.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeyGBq.png altenter image description herep  pWhere XCode Interface Builder automatically creates constraints such as at the edges of the view it seems to behave in a way I understand.p  pWhat I dont understand is why in the .xib shown here, and also available a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B07SrKpE8ErmYWM2dGFtOU9DVmsedituspsharingherea, why I cant get the green and magenta regions to maintain a constant border the white area between them that gets no thicker and no thinner, no matter what happens to the size of the view.  p  pThat means I need the green area not to resize vertically and only resize horizontally, but its insisting on anchoring itself to the bottom of the form, and although starting from a new blank nib again, will restore interface builder so it will notice adjacency of the green and magenta views again, once interface builder has gone stupid it insists on only defining the green views bottom edge in terms of its distance from its parent views bottom edge, and wont for any amount of fiddling do otherwise using mere drag and drop operations. I have also experimented with the Pin commands and havent found a pin command that works. p  pNo amount of fighting with interface builder menus or dragging and dropping seems to be enough, to get it to let go of one of the constraints.  I cant figure out what Im supposed to do. Delete a constraint How  Constraints cant be deleted at all as far as I can see, either from the IB Objects pane or from the Utilities  Size inspector. There is a delete option but its grayed out in the drop down menu that appears when you click the gear icon button in the constraints area.p  pIdeally Id love it if the green area resized as the view gets wider, but not as it gets taller or shorter. I thought this was obvious in every other tool, but in XCodeAutolayout, its either not resize at all, or resize in all four directions. I cant delete or remove the constraints that are doing things I dont want to do.  Do you have to have four constraints on each view that is inside another viewp  pUpdate 1 You can not remove any constraint that would result in an ambiguous or unspecified layout.p  pUpdate 2 Sometimes if a uiview pane wont snap to a sibling, deleting that uiview and trying again will allow it to naturally snap to a sibling, and the constraint will be made relative to a sibling view object instead of a parent.p  pUpdate 3 Matt deleted his workaround, Ive reproduced it below.p  pWorkaround for people who didnt want Autolayout in the first place, and who just wanted the old springs and struts backp  h2Step 1 Turn Off Autolayouth2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGyMQQ.png altenter image description here  p  h2Step 2 Select the Correct Autoresizing Masksh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEMDyb.png altenter image description here p

I have created the following specificationp  precodeclass TestSpec extends Specification   def crazy closures      def mockDao  MockCustomDao     def idSet  [9,10]      given An initialized object         def customService  new CustomService         customService.customDao  mockDao      when createOutput is called         def outputSet  customService.createOutputSet      then the following methods should be called         1mockDao.getIds gtgt              return idSet                   for int i0 iltidSet.size i              int id  idSet.geti             1mockDao.getModelByIdidSet.geti gtgt                  def tmp  new Model                 int tmpId  id  idSet.geti                 return tmp                            and each compute package is accurate         2  outputSet.size         9  outputSet.get0.getId         10  outputSet.get1.getId    codepre  pNotice that in here I test two things. First, I initialize the dao with my mock, verify that the daos are correctly called and return the proper data, and then I verify that I get the proper output i.e. codeandcode.p  pThe tricky part is the for loop, in which I wanted to return models from the mock dao that are related to the method parameter.  In the above example, if I use a simple codefor  in idSetcode, the models only return with id 10  codeoutputSet.get0.getId  outputSet.get1.getId  10code.  If I use the traditional for loop, and set the model with codeidSet.geticode, I get an codeIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode .  The only way to make this work is by retrieving the value in a local variable codeidcode and setting with variable, as above.p  pI know this is related to groovy closures and I suspect that spock captures the mock calls into a set of closures before executing them, which means that the model creation depends on the outer state of the closure. I understand why I would get the IndexOutOfBoundsException, but I dont understand why codeint id  idSet.geticode is captured by the closure whereas codeicode is not.p  pWhat is the differencep  pNote this is not the live code but rather simplified to demonstrate the crux of my challenge. I would not and do not make two subsequent dao calls on getIds and getModelById.p

Negative 7315 pWe have a Wpf application with an Hwndhost element we use for rendering 3d content via DirectX.  We expose a Panel interface to clients which contains a MouseEnter and MouseLeave event.  For the Hwndhost panel we simulate a MouseEnter event when we first receive a WMMOUSEMOVE event to the HwndHost.WndProc since win32 does not have a WMMOUSEENTER event.  Also, for the HwndHost we request a WMMOUSELEAVE event via TrackMouseEvent which simulates the MouseLeave event on our panel interface.  p  pstrongThe problem is that when the user moves the mouse very rapidly to, or from the HwndHost panel we receive the enter event from the panel the mouse is moving to before we receive the leave event for the panel the mouse is moving from.strong  This does not happen when both the source and destination panels are both wpf elements, only when the hwndhost element is involved.  Also, if there are two of these HwndHost elements next to each other the same behavior occurs, so that it looks like win32 is not sending messages in the order they occur.p  pstrongDoes anyone know of

Negative 7315 pIve been struggling with a Rails project recently where essentially every page of the project needs to be accessible both via regular navigation for older browsers and via AJAX without a layout. I recently found a solution to the problem by putting this at the top ApplicationControllerp  precodelayout proc  request.xhr  false  application  codepre  pThis line should cause all the controller actions to render with a layout when accessed normally, and without a controller when accessed via AJAX, but it seems a bit too good to be true.p  pI was wondering if there may be any security or performance downfalls of this approach that Im forgetting Is there a better way of doing it Is there any possibility that some obscure, old browser may render without the layout when it should be accident, or visa versap  pBasically, am I overlooking anything Could this be dangerousp
Negative 7315 pI am using MSAccess Database for my application. now I want to store current date in DB from JAVA. Following Code Segment stores date data in Database but it stores the incorrect value 661905. The datatype in MSAccess is DateTime. I used following code segment for setting current datep  precodedata.setModifyDatenew Datenew java.util.Date.getTime codepre  pThe type of modifyDate is java.sql.Date. The insert query is as followsp  precodeString query  INSERT INTO testTableid, tName, modifyDate                             VALUES data.getId,                                     data.getTName,                                     data.getModifyDate  Statement s  conn.createStatement s.executequery codepre  pTimeStamp is not supported in MSAccess 2007. So, how can I store the correct date valuep
Negative 7315 pi am trying to update an Entity inside a transaction, first i select the entity using its primary key, then lazily loaded its child entities and made changes to its properties through setter methods. After that when i merge the parent object, automatically all its child objects with OneToMany relations gets updated. Although this is the required functionality, but i am little confused with this behavior because i didnt specified any cascade options for the child entities. In order to make sure, i even tried a nonrelational table, just queried using find JPAQL and changed its properties. When the transaction commited after the merge operation of the main entity, this nonrelational entity also gets updated along with others. I am not sure this is the correct behavior, or its the problem of understanding the JPA and merge operation inside transactions.p  pMy Parent classp  precodeclass Student Id GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY Basicoptional  false Columnname  id, nullable  false private Integer id  private String name OneToManymappedBy  student private ListltSubjectsgt subjects  public Integer getId return id  public void setIdInteger id this.idid  public String getName return name  public void setNameString name this.namename  codepre  pMy Child classp  precodeClass Subjects  Id GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY Basicoptional  false Columnname  id, nullable  false private Integer id  JoinColumnname  student, referencedColumnName  id, nullable  false ManyToOneoptional  false private Student student  public Integer getId return id  public void setIdInteger id this.idid   public String getCourse return course  public void setCourseString course this.coursecourse  codepre  pNonRelational Entity is just an Entity class without any relations with this selected entity classes. I added it to just to check whether the updations happened due to any relations specified in the entity classesEven without cascade options.p  pMy Transactional Update function.p  precode    Object obj1  this.transactionTemplate.executenew TransactionCallback  public Object doInTransactionTransactionStatus status   Category categoryfindById2 NonRelated entity with Student or Subject category.setNamenew category  Student studentfindStudentById1 forSubjects subjectsstudent.getSubjects subjects.setCoursetest  student.setNamestudent1 entityManager.mergestudent     return true       codepre  pso the final outcome after merging and transaction commit is that, all the tablesStudent, Subjects and Categoryupdated.p
Negative 7315 pI have an ADO Recordset containing a table of products. I have a list of products used to filter the table  dynamically building a Filter like this but longer p  precoders.Filter  productType  product A    or productType  product B    or productType  product C  codepre  pThis worked fine for me, I copied the filtered rows into a separate worksheet, all fine.p  pThen new project requirements meant I needed to get the emexcludedem items as well.  Very well, I did some boolean algebra, and ran the same query with an opposite filter p  precoders2.Filter  productType ltgt product A    and productType ltgt product B    and productType ltgt product C  codepre  pThis also worked fine.  I copy the excluded items into a different worksheet, so now I have both the included and the excluded items.p  pBUT a new requirement means I have to cope with a special case  product B will only be included on specific dates.  Now, this works fine for the positive filter, the one to find emincludedem items p  precoders.Filter  productType  product A    or productType  product B and expiry  16082013    or productType  product C  codepre  pbut I run into problems with the negative filter the one to find the excluded items.  The following is not allowed due to the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1510860problemswithrecordsetfilter16155401615540restriction on nested ORs in ADO Recordset Filtera p  precoders2.Filter  productType ltgt product A    and productType ltgt product B or expiry ltgt 16082013    and productType ltgt product C  codepre  pIs there an alternative solution E.g. some way to get the complement of a Filter i.e. just the rows that it excludesp  pI should stress  the list of products to include is built up dynamically, its not available to me when writing the code.p

My current approach does this matching, but unfortunately gives me a single long list, instead of the list of lists I described.p  pHeres what i havep  precodeimport re regexLines[[]b[], a[][], [][]c, foobarbaz, wx[][], []xyz] targetLines[wxyz, abc, foo, foobar, foobarbaz]  compiling the regex lines matchLines[re.compilei for i in regexLines]  matchMatrix[i.matchj for i in matchLines for j in targetLines]  matchMatrix [None, ltsre.SREMatch object at 0x04095368gt, None, None, None, None, ltsre.SREMatch     object at 0x0411A3D8gt, None, None, None, None, ltsre.SREMatch object at 0x0411A410gt, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, ltsre.SREMatch object at 0x0411A448gt, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None] codepre  pI instead want something that looks like this, with each row representing the matches for a phrasep  precode[[None, ltsre.SREMatch object at 0x04095368gt, None, None, None, None],  [ltsre.SREMatch object at 0x0411A3D8gt, None, None, None, None, ltsre.SREMatch object at 0x0411A410gt], etc. etc. codepre  pI could write out a verbose loop that could do what I want, but my inkling is that theres a concise, Pythonic way to do this.p

Negative 7315 pThis is a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19575095cseleniumnewwindowhandlesdisappearinginiecantswitchtonewwindowa previous questiona that I asked here.p  pI previously encountered an issue with switching windows in Internet Explorer 10 using Selenium 2.37.0. My C program would navigate to a page, click a button that opens a link, and attempt to navigate to the new window to perform additional tasks. My program kept failing, and I determined that this was because of Seleniums window handles. After opening a new window, the number of window handles codedriver.WindowHandles.Countcode increases from 1 to 2, as expected, but after some amount of time, the number of window handles drops back down to 1.p  pI have created a minimal sample webpage that reproduces this issue. Simply save the following code into a file called codetest.aspxcode on your desktopp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml gt ltbodygt     ltinput idbtn typebutton valueLink  langjavascript     onclickwindow.opentest.aspxgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is my C code a Console project in Visual Studio 2010 called codeTestWindowSwitchingcode that opens this page, clicks the button, and prints some outputp  precodeusing System using System.Threading          Needed for Sleep using System.Diagnostics        Needed for Stopwatch  using OpenQA.Selenium using OpenQA.Selenium.IE  namespace TestWindowSwitching      class Program              static void Main                      IWebDriver driver  new InternetExplorerDriver              driver.Navigate.GoToUrlCUsersyourNameHereDesktoptest.aspx              try  driver.SwitchTo.DefaultContent              catch  Thread.Sleep10               Console.WriteLineInitial number of window handles   driver.WindowHandles.Count              Stopwatch sw  new Stopwatch              try  driver.FindElementBy.Idbtn.Click              catch  Thread.Sleep10                Wait until number of window handles becomes 2             while driver.WindowHandles.Count  2                               Do nothing                           sw.Start               Wait until number of window handles changes from 2             while driver.WindowHandles.Count  2                               Do nothing                           Console.WriteLineNumber of window handles has dropped to   driver.WindowHandles.Count                                      in   sw.ElapsedMilliseconds   ms              sw.Stop              Console.WritePress Enter to close...

I simply get the Javascript command in this case, codewindow.opentest.aspxcode and use it directly to navigate to the page without opening a new window.p  pHowever, as I mentioned in my previous post, I feel that others may have encountered this issue a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18767109howtoswitchtoanewwindowusingseleniumexample 1a, a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsgseleniumusersJ7bV14i6kkEeWsqV5UzkCUJ relnofollowexample 2a, so if this is in fact a bug in Selenium, it is worth investigating.

Negative 7315 pIm developing a mecanism for Cassandra using Hector.  What I need at this moment is to know which are the hash values of the keys to look at which node is storedlooking the tokens of each one, and ask directly this node for the value. What I understood is that dependeing on the partitioner Cassandra uses, the values are stored independently from one partitioner to other. So, are the hash values of all keys stored in any table In case not, how could I implement a generic class that once I read from System Keyspace the partitioner that is using Cassandra this class could be an instance of it without the necessity of modifiying the code depending on the partitioner I would need it to call the getToken method to calculate the hash value for a given key.

Normally when this module is enabled, after logging in once the module sets codeHTTPLOGINcode to the username. But I want to configure my webserver in such a way that I have a fall back option. My idea was to set an environment variable in the Apache config indicating which SSO solution is currently active. I checked this and it works as intended. The web application sees the new environment variable.p  pBut I also want to force codeHTTPLOGINcode to a predetermined value readonly. When set codeHTTPLOGINcode unconditionally, this works as expected, but I want codeHTTPLOGINcode conditionally set whenever codeSSOSOLUTIONcode is set to codenonecode.p  precodeSetEnv SSOSOLUTION none SetEnvIf SSOSOLUTION none HTTPLOGINreadonly codepre  pThis doesnt seem to work, but I understood from the a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modmodsetenvif.htmlSetEnvIf relnofollowApache documentsa that it should.

Negative 7315 pIve been investigating the answer to this question for a while but cannot find an answer, so I thought of asking it here.p  p.Net C offers two ways of rounding double values, both with a call to Math.Round but specifying a different MidPointRounding option, either ToEven or AwayFromZero. So far so good. p  pIt turns out that the AwayFromZero method might now always perform as expected for certain values, such is the case when rounding 2.135 to 2 decimal places, where the result is 2.13 when the expected result would be 2.14. This error is well documented in the .Net documentation under the Note to callers section a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryf5898377.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryf5898377.aspxap  pRounding the same value with the ToEven method also rounds it to 2.13.p  pHowever, when displaying the original value to screen 2.135 with the help of the codeToStringCcode method, which converts the value to string rounded to 2 decimal places, the displayed value is 2.14. p  pIt turns out that rounding with codeToStringCcode rounds values correctly away from zero without the errors found in the Math.Round, the only problem is that the result is a string, and I do not want to have to parse the result again to have a number properly rounded.p  pDoes anyone which rounding method uses codeToStringCcode method internallyp  pDoes anyone have any explanation for this behaviorp

Negative 7315 pIm wishing that codeMKMapViewcode inherited from codeUIScrollViewcode just like codeUITableViewcode and codeUICollectionViewcode are.

For example if youre in mid scroll and lift your finger, the map keeps going and slows down then eventually stops. p  pWhat Im doing is rendering some offscreen annotations in an overlay on top of my map another codeUIViewcode using core graphics. Its working great except for the deceleration problem. p  pAll I need to know is that the map has moved. The parameters I need I can query straight from the map itself. p  pHas anyone found a technique to get callbacks while decelerating I mean I suppose I could use a timer when the gesture ends to fire repeatedly for a half a second or so. p

Negative 7315 pIm trying to wrap my head around how to use VAOs appropriately for instanced rendering specifically in Qt 5.2, using OpenGL 3.3. My understanding is that VAOs save the state of the VBOs and associated attributes so that you dont need to worry about binding and enabling everything at drawing time, you just bind the VAO. But with instancing, you often have multiple VBOs. How do you get around needing to bind them all Or do I just need to use a single VBO for both my per vertex data and my per instance datap  pIve been looking at a couple tutorials, for example a hrefhttpogldev.atspace.co.ukwwwtutorial33tutorial33.html relnofollowhttpogldev.atspace.co.ukwwwtutorial33tutorial33.htmlap  pIt looks to me like what he does is use a VAO for his per vertex data and NOT for his per instance data. Ive tried doing the same thing with my Qtbased code, and its not working for me probably because I dont entirely understand how that works... shouldnt his instance data still need to be bound when drawing happensp  pSome dummy code... this is a bit silly, Im just drawing a single instance of two triangles, with a perspective matrix as a per instance attribute.p  pglwindow.cppp  precodeinclude

Negative 7315 pI have a Maven project that runs all unit tests fine locally, but when the same project is run on our Jenkins server, some unit test or other occasionally starts failing after a completely unrelated change.   Its like its running the tests in random order and not resetting the inmemory HSQLDB database before each test, so the output of one randomlyselected test is getting fed into the input of the next test.     I thought the resetting of test data was part of the automatic JUnit process.  p  pAnybody know whats causing this, and more importantly, how to cure itp  pThe Jenkins setup for the project is Jenkins ver. 1.534,  Maven 3.1.1, Java 1.7p  pThe test thats currently failing is set up like sop  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationlocationsclasspathtestcontext.xml public class MyAppStatusServiceTest       Autowired     MyAppStatusService service      Test     public void createTest          MyAppStatus test  new MyAppStatus         test.setStatusCodeY         test.setStatusDefinitionTest Data         test  service.savetest         assertEqualsTest Data,test.getStatusDefinition           Test     public void readTest          MyAppStatus test  service.findOneApplicationStatus.PENDING.getCode          assertEqualsPending,test.getStatusDefinition            Test     public void updateTest          MyAppStatus test  service.findOneApplicationStatus.PENDING.getCode         test.setStatusDefinitionNew Value         test  service.savetest          MyAppStatus readme  service.findOneApplicationStatus.PENDING.getCode         assertEqualsNew Value, StringUtils.trimreadme.getStatusDefinition       codepre  pThe error that comes back is the failure of the second test as follows  p  precodeorg.junit.ComparisonFailure expectedlt[Pending]gt but waslt[New Value]gt codepre  pso it appears the bottom test is getting run, the datas not getting reset, and then the middle test is running and failing.

Negative 7315 pSheetTime.php is the main page. When the user goes to SheetTime.php, they are redirected to Login.php if their login is successful there, they will then be directed to the actual content of the SheetTime.php. p  pThe problem is with the logout button that I have. When the user clicks the logout button, they are always redirected to the SheetTime.php page appears to just refresh rather than being actually logged out and directed back to the Login.php. I have tried to change the location in Logout.php to Login.php and checked the URL, but I had the same result. p  pMy theory to why this problem occurs is that because I set the location in Logout.php to the SheetTime.php, it goes back to Login.php, then back to SheetTime.php, etc. Pretty much seems to be caught in a loop here and I dont have much experiences with these kinds of loops. p  pWhen the user clicks the logout button, I want them to be logged out of the site and back to the login page so they can login to the site again.

I am new to OpenCV I have worked through the tutorials that come with the documentation, but that is it  any advice about how to go about this normalization would be extremely helpful. p  pThanks p  pHere is my attempt p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv Mat sourceImage, I const char redWindow  Red Color Channel const char greenWindow  Green Color Channel const char blueWindow  Blue Color Channel   ifargc  2    cout ltlt Incorrect number of arguments ltlt endl   Load the image  sourceImage  imreadargv[1], 1 ifsourceImage.data    cout ltlt Image failed to load ltlt endl    First, we have to allocate the new channels  Mat rsourceImage.rows, sourceImage.cols, CV8UC1 Mat bsourceImage.rows, sourceImage.cols, CV8UC1 Mat gsourceImage.rows, sourceImage.cols, CV8UC1   Now we put these into a matrix  Mat out[]  b, g, r   Split the image into the three color channels  splitsourceImage, out   I  r  b  g3   addb, g, I addI, r, I I  I3  Mat red  rI Mat blue  bI Mat green  gI   Create the windows  namedWindowblueWindow, 0 namedWindowgreenWindow, 0 namedWindowredWindow, 0   Show the images  imshowblueWindow, blue imshowgreenWindow, green imshowredWindow, red  waitKey0 return 0  codepre

Negative 7315 pCurrently I am working on a Swing application in Java. Lets call this program Simulator. My task is to deliver packages to their destination by trucks. I have a thread which calculates scheduling of the truckswhich package when to deliver.This thread can run in some cases very long. In a second threadcalculator thread I am calculating the step of simulation. These two threads should communicate with each other. The algorithm thread sends  plans and trucks to the calculator thread and  calculator thread sends back free trucks to the algorithm thread. The simulation ends when the calculator thread ends its work. My question is related to drawing of the simulation. Where should  a call the drawing of the components In the same thread where the steps are calculated Third thread for drawing Any other possible optionsp

Negative 7315 pNote Although this question is about store, the load case has the same issues and is perfectly symmetric.p  pThe SSE intrinsics provide an a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7ek6y8w1vvs.90.aspxcodemmstoreupdcodea function with the following signaturep  precodevoid mmstoreupd double p, m128d a codepre  pSo if I have vector of two doubles, and I want to store it to an array of two doubles, I can just use this intrinsic.p  pHowever, my vector is not two doubles it is two 64bit integers, and I want to store it to an array of two 64bit integers. That is, I want a function with the following signaturep  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64 int64t p, m128i a codepre  pBut the intrinsics provide no such function. The closest they have is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryw1k1k29tvvs.90.aspxcodemmstoreusi128codeap  precodevoid mmstoreusi128 m128i p, m128i a codepre  pThe problem is that this function takes a pointer to codem128icode, while my array is an array of codeint64tcode. Writing to an object via the wrong type of pointer is a violation of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions98650strict aliasinga and is definitely undefined behavior. I am concerned that my compiler, now or in the future, will reorder or otherwise optimize away the store thus breaking my program in strange ways.p  pTo be clear, what I want is a function I can invoke like thisp  precodem128i v  mmsetepi64x2,1 int64t ra[2] mmstoreuepi64ampra[0], v  does not exist, so I want to implement it codepre  pHere are six attempts to create such a function.p  h2Attempt 1h2  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64int64t p, m128i a      mmstoreusi128reinterpretcastltm128i gtp, a  codepre  pThis appears to have the strict aliasing problem I am worried about.p  h2Attempt 2h2  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64int64t p, m128i a      mmstoreusi128staticcastltm128i gtstaticcastltvoid gtp, a  codepre  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1863069Possibly better in generala, but I do not think it makes any difference in this case.p  h2Attempt 3h2  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64int64t p, m128i a      union TypePun          int64t a[2]         m128i v           TypePun pu  reinterpretcastltTypePun gtp     pugtv  a  codepre  pThis generates incorrect code on my compiler GCC 4.9.0, which emits an aligned codemovapscode instruction instead of an unaligned codemovupscode.

The typepunning via union trick, although a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11373203technically undefined in Ca, is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions346622widelysupporteda. But is this example  where I pass a pointer to an element of a union rather than access via the union itself  really a valid way to use the union for typepunningp  h2Attempt 5h2  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64int64t p, m128i a      p[0]  mmextractepi64a, 0     p[1]  mmextractepi64a, 1  codepre  pThis works and is perfectly valid, but it emits two instructions instead of one.p  h2Attempt 6h2  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64int64t p, m128i a      stdmemcpyp, ampa, sizeofa  codepre  pThis works and is perfectly valid... I think. But it emits frankly terrible code on my system. GCC spills codeacode to an aligned stack slot via an aligned store, then manually moves the component words to the destination. Actually it spills it twice, once for each component. Very strange.p  p...p  pIs there any way to write this function that will a generate optimal code on a typical modern compiler and b have minimal risk of running afoul of strict aliasingp

Negative 7315 pI have a button that I want to use on my screen. However when I resize my desktop window, the touch coordinates messes up itself.

Its kind of hard to explain but I will try my best. The scale is working properly. However, since I am using Fitviewport, when I call Gdx.graphics.getHeights or .getWidth, its getting the height and width of the entire screen including the black areas when I increase one side only. Thus, this makes my scale for my input proportional to the entire screen. While the images are being illustrated via Fitviewport and being resized proportional to its original size. This makes my input position where the button responses to be too far left or right or up or down compared to the images that are drawn. I have also tried cam.unproject.

Negative 7315 pIm relatively new to node.js, and Ive been tasked with writing a simple message queue app  basically, the app will receive a post containing some message data and the clients mac address, which we decode and then insert into a sqlite database, to be posted later by a separate process.p  pEverything works fine, but were experiencing what may be a memory leak. Using the memwatch module, Ive narrowed the leak down to our code handling incoming posts, which Ive included belowp  precodeapp.route     .postfunctionreq, res     var mac  decodeURIunescapereq.parammac.replaceg, 20     var data  decodeURIunescapereq.paramdata.replaceg, 20         req  null      db.runINSERT INTO queue mac, data VALUES ,, [mac, data], functioner         ifer              res.writeHead500, Insert to queue failed, ContentType texthtml             res.end          else              res.writeHead200, OK, ContentType texthtml             res.end                  res  null         mac  null         data  null       codepre  pIm unable to find anything in here that looks incorrect, but when we post 10000 requests to the app we almost always trigger a memory leak event in memwatch. Im looking for a nudge in the right direction here are we simply misinterpreting memwatch, or is there a leak here Im missing somehow As I understand it memwatch considers heap growth over 5 or more V8 garbage collection attempts consecutively to be a leak  it seems possible that with 10000 posts at once like this that that sort of heap growth would be expected, but I havent yet found a definitive answer and need to rule it out. Any help, even if you just point me in the right direction, would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7315 pThis is a long one.p  pI have a list of usernames and passwords. For each one I want to login to the accounts and do something things. I want to use several machines to do this faster. The way I was thinking of doing this is have a main machine whose job is just having a cron which from time to time checks if the rabbitmq queue is empty. If it is, read the list of usernames and passwords from a file and send it to the rabbitmq queue. Then have a bunch of machines which are subscribed to that queue whose job is receiving a userpass, do stuff on it, acknowledge it, and move on to the next one, until the queue is empty and then the main machine fills it up again. So far I think I have everything down.p  pNow comes my problem. I have checked that the things to be done with each userpasses arent so intensive and so I could have each machine doing three of them simultaneously using pythons threading. In fact for a single machine I have implemented this where I load the userpasses into a python Queue and then have three threads consume that Queue. Now I want to do something similar, but instead of consuming from a python Queue, each thread of each machine should consume from a rabbitmq queue. This is where Im stuck. To run tests I started by using rabbitmqs tutorial.p  psend.pyp  precodeimport pika, sys connection  pika.BlockingConnectionpika.ConnectionParameterslocalhost channel  connection.channel channel.queuedeclarequeuehello  message   .joinsys.argv[1] channel.basicpublishexchange,                       routingkeyhello,                       bodymessage connection.close codepre  pworker.pyp  precodeimport time, pika  connection  pika.BlockingConnectionpika.ConnectionParameterslocalhost channel  connection.channel channel.queuedeclarequeuehello  def callbackch, method, properties, body     print  [x] received r  body,     time.sleep body.count.      ch.basicackdeliverytag  method.deliverytag  channel.basicqosprefetchcount1 channel.basicconsumecallback, queuehello, noackFalse channel.startconsuming codepre  pFor the above you can run two worker.py which will subscribe to the rabbitmq queue and consume as expected.p  pMy threading without rabbitmq is something like thisp  prunit.pyp  precodeclass Threadeddostuffthreading.Thread     def initself, userqueue         threading.Thread.initself         self.userqueue  userqueue      def runself         while True             login  self.userqueue.get             dostuffuserlogin[0], passlogin[1]             self.userqueue.taskdone  userqueue  Queue.Queue for i in range3     td  Threadeddostuffuserqueue     td.setDaemonTrue     td.start   fill up the queue for user in listusers     userqueue.putuser   go userqueue.join codepre  pThis also works as expected you fill up the queue and have 3 threads subscribe to it.

Negative 7315 pI have a large set of 8 series of data over time, and currently I have two working graphs, one that has a range selector allowing you to slide a bar to select which dates to show, and the other has the ability to click on the chart legend to choose which of the series to show and which of the series to hide.p  pI havent been able to combine them together, though, into one unified dashboard that does both together. This particular code allows you to filter the date, but hidingshowing a series doesnt work.

Negative 7315 pI am using a hrefhttpsws.apache.orgwss4jdownload.html relnofollowWSS4Ja to create a soap request signer with a certificate from the keystore. My keystore format is .pkcs and everything works with the first signing, but if I try to run the program to sign more than one document and it doesnt find the certificate in the keystore. It seems to me that the certificate is possibly consumed during signing, which means that it no longer exists for the current environment. If the program stops and starts again it will sign the first request but the second request fails. I have stepped through multiple times and cannot figure out what the cause is. This code is the last thing being called before the certificate disappears from the keystore codethis.certUri  getWsConfig.getIdAllocator.createSecureIdX509, certs[0]code this is found on line 556 in codeWSSecSignature.classcode.

Negative 7315 pIm trying to understand where is the right place to put codeEnableTransactionManagementcode annotation in case of multiple JavaConfig contextsp  pConsider following scenario I have JPA config in JPAConfig.java and AppConfig.java with set of service beans. Then I compose overall application config in RootConfig.java.p  pI define transaction manager within JPAConfig.java as well as enable scanning for JPA repositories  as those expose transactional behavior, I put codeEnableTransactionManagementcode over JPAConfig and it works.p  pHowever, some of service beans also need to have transactional methods e.g. accessing several repositories within single transaction. Should I also put codeEnableTransactionManagementcode over AppConfig as well Looking into implementation of this annotation is seems to me that such approach would cause redefinition of some beans. And actually doing so doesnt seem to work for me.p  precodeConfiguration EnableTransactionManagement EnableJpaRepositoriescom.mypackage.repositories public class JPAConfig    ... here are EntityManager and PlatformTransactionManager beans    Configuration ComponentScancom.mypackage.services  EnableTransactionManagement    public class AppConfig    Configuration ImportAppConfig.class, JPAConfig.class public class RootConfig   codepre  pAppreciate any advices.p
Negative 7315 pSo, Ive been using the .NET framework for a little while now. There have been many times when Im calling some static function or an instance method of Listlt where I wonder what the relative performance cost of these operations are. In this case, I was wondering how terrible the static method Enum.GetValues is. Is there any place where I can figure out relatively the run time of a .NET operation If not, how do you know which methods can safely be called often and which ones you should avoid Will I just have to test every method with a timer please God no.. Or is this something Im being overly concerned aboutp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 7315 pI was looking at Leader Election Pattern from Cloud Design Pattern a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn568104.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn568104.aspxa. It uses an approach that was described in other places as well a hrefhttpblog.smarx.compostsmanagingconcurrencyinwindowsazurewithleases relnofollowhttpblog.smarx.compostsmanagingconcurrencyinwindowsazurewithleasesa and mentioned in at least one other question on Stack Overflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13259120windowsazureleaderinstancewithoutsinglepointoffailiureWindows Azure  leader instance without single point of failiurea.p  pIn general the election process boils down to processes competing for Blob Storage lease. Lease itself is exclusive so only one process can hold it at a given point in time. In the Leader Election Pattern the lease is initially acquired for a predefined period of time between 15 and 60 sec and renewed by a background thread running on the process holding a lease.p  pWhat I was wandering is whether this solution does not suffer from a possible race condition. Is it not possible that if for some reason a current leader does not manage to renew lock in time extensive load, network delays a different process in the distributed system may assume that it is a leader as wellp  pAs far as I could understand the approach is used in EventProcessorHost for Event Hubs partition leases.p  pEditp  pI think this a hrefhttpredis.iotopicsdistlock relnofollowhttpredis.iotopicsdistlocka explains how to be sure there are no two procesess that both think they are leaders in case of partitioning. In short the algorithm assumes that proces will stop immediatelly after figuring out that it cannot renew lock. If it tries to renew lock long enough before lease expires there will be no other proces that can grab the lock.p
Negative 7315 pI have a 3D matrix of size emX, Y, Zem which is stored in a data structure as emZem matrices, each emX x Yem in size. I would like to reslice these matrices to obtain emXem slices, each emY x Zem in size. In other words, I want to reslice a 3D matrix stored as XY slices in the YZ plane. The use case is to reslice axial CT images into sagittal images. I am working inside a strongbrowser environment.strongp  pHeres an example of what I am trying to achievep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comprSnW.jpg althttpieeexplore.ieee.orgieeepilotarticles06ttg2009061407assetsimgarticle1fig2large.jpg]series[enter image description herep  pI have implemented the naive iterative solution in Python, which takes OY  Z per slice. I havent even bothered writing out the corresponding JavaScript implementation, because this approach is too slow by several orders of magnitude.p  precodeimport glob import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.misc import imread  height, width, depth  512, 512, 100  volume  np.zerosheight, width, depth  s  0  for filename in glob.iglob..jpg   volume[,,s]   imreadfilename[...,0]255.0   s  1  reslice  np.zerosdepth, height, width  for s in xrange0, width   current  np.zerosdepth, height   for i in xrange0, height     for j in xrange0, depth       current[j,i]  volume[i,s,j]   reslice[,,s]  current codepre  pThis algorithm seems to be amenable to parallelization. For example, in CUDA, one could load the 3D data into global memory, create one thread per pixel, then iterate for every slice in the new direction, and on each iteration ask the right pixels to fire in order to fill out the current slice. This would be a trivial kernel to write, and would be approximately O1 per slice. However, I dont have access to CUDA in the browser.p  pMapping from CUDA to WebCL is relatively straightforward, but WebCL is out of question given inexistent vendor support ATM. Therefore, Im thinking WebGL is the ideal solution.p  pIm not too sure how this would be done in the WebGL paradigm, but Im sure it can be done, and I suspect it is fairly trivial as well. I cant seem to find where to start, however, and resources on doing generalpurpose computations with OpenGL are extremely scarce. How would I go about using OpenGL to speed up reslicing of a 3D matrix inside the browserp

Negative 7315 pI am using light table for python development. While typing in the editor if I want to open the command window using ctrlspace, it doesnt work. I have to first press AltV to open the command window from the menubar at the top. Is there another way to open command window using a keyboard shortcut while typing in the editorp  pNote that I have activated emacskeybindings in light table.p  pAlso note that AltV is a keybinding that has to be handled differently by light table and emacs. While in editor light table seems to be handling it whereas its operation in emacs scroll up is disregarded.p  pIn this sense I would actually like to ask how can I handle keybindings that are handled differently by emacs and light tablep

Negative 7315 pRecently we moved classic asp application vb6 com components from W2K3 server to W2K8 server. The only change made in the vb6 component is upgrade from MSXML 2.0 to MSXML 6.0. These vb6 components are compiled into dlls and registered as COM components on the server. The issue we are facing right now is that asp pages are taking a lot of time to load. The functionality which used to take 810 sec is now taking around 40 seconds. We inserted the logs and found that all the functions in vb6 code which are related to MSXML 6.0 upgrade have caused the slowness in the application.p  pOn further research, we found that vb6 modules which uses 64 bit version of MSXML6.0present under CWindowsSystem32 to load XML documents takes over two times longer to load an xml doc which uses 32bit version of MSXML6.0. present under CWindowssysWOW64p  pMicrosoft has provided a hotfix for this.

Negative 7315 pI have a form which has fields like emailid, username etc that need validation. There are errors like email doesnt exist in our company, email already has a account registered, username not avaiable.  To validate these errors, it requires me to do database query. So the email field looks like this  p  precodeltpinputText idemail requiredtrue validatorMessageInvalid EmailId  EmailId must end with soemthing.com requiredMessageMandatory Field size25 valueaccountBean.email titleYour Emailidgt       ltfvalidateRegex patternwsomething.comgt       ltpclientValidator eventblur gt       ltfajax eventblur listeneraccountBean.validateEmailgt ltpinputTextgt codepre  pSo when emailid loses focus, I validate the field using ajax request. So if users emailid is not valid or already exists, I show that error on the page. Same thing I am doing it for username and other fields, that need to be validate through database query. But I do not want to again use these validation, through database query, when user is submitting the form. I want to keep record of all these errors and when the user submits the form, I can show FacesMessage that these errors still need to be resolved and not go for submission of form.p  pI thought of keeping the errors record in some stringBuffer. So whenever error occurs, I append the error to the StringBuffer. So on submit I check if StringBuffer is empty and if its not, I show the errors. But problem is if user makes two errors and both are appended to StringBuffer then If user corrects one error, there is no way to remove that specific error from StringBuffer. So that wont work.p  pRight now I am using one boolean per type of these errors that require database validation. So at the submit I check, what error booleans are still true and return the messages according to these errors. But to have one boolean per error doesnt look good to me. So any suggestions p

Negative 7315 pI have a Microsoft Access database that contains a table with a field of type Numeric double precision. This field however, contains no actual floats but only integers. The external tool reading these integers from the Access database somehow manages to convert them to the actual values they represent, but I cannot figure out how it does it. The following values on the left represent the value on the rightp  precode135701  0.001 135803  0.01 135671  0.1 136655  0.2 131479  0.5 144655  1 141447  1.5 154687  2 1015711  88 872543  100 codepre  pThese are just some of the values Ive managed to track down. Seeing as how its a table of approximately 110.000 records and the fact that there are no other tables the integer on the left links to, Im guessing they are either being calculated to their correct float value or somehow encoded into an integer. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to calculate back to the actual value and cannot access the source code of the tool that does it. Changing the integers around in the database does change the values, so they are somehow derived from them.p

Negative 7315 pI keep finding sites talking about CSSShapes where the idea is that instead of rectangular I can use CSS to create texts that take a number of shapes such as circular. But the websites I find, have codes that do not work. And then when I look at their own source code since they have the examples on their very website, it turns out all the examples they have are images  as opposed to real code. So I am asking here. Is this CSSShape real yet I want to render a text inside a semicircle. Thats how I discover about CSSShapes.p

Negative 7315 pI am making a shiny app that simulates an AB test. I want to input the parameters and display the test graphically. Everything works fine except for one small thing. Scroll down to the bottom of server.R below. I am pretty sure something is going wrong with the inputVisitors inside the ggplot. When I change that to the default value of Visitors the plot shows up and it works. However, I need that value to vary with the scroll bar. With that in there, I get this error Error in evalexpr, envir, enclos  object input not found.

Negative 7315 pI am quite new to groovy, and I have found out that by making a field public, groovy provides getters and setters by default.

Negative 7315 pI have an odd problem where I am receiving computer generated equations as a string where multiplicationsdivisions with zero or one and lone zeros are occasionally present. These equations are to be presented to a user in string form. p  pI know that I can remove these redundant parts of the equation by implementing a kind of parser, but I was curious as to whether a regular expression could be used to remove them.p  pI came up with the following before I finally gave up on my quite limited regex skillsp  precode[]0001,[]11g codepre  pIt seems to work only ifp  ul lithere are no nonzero numbers with a zero in them ie. no 10s,20s,etc.li lithere are no negations.li ul  pIt also doesnt work well with parentheses. Unfortunately parentheses are quite common.p  pNote that removing the redundant portions stated above may result in redundant parentheses or zero parentheses ie it could turn out like codexcode, which is equivalent to code0xcode. The redundant parentheses are not as much of an issue, but I assume the zero parentheses could be removed by a second pass similar to the first looking for codecode. If either of these could be done in the same regex as the one that solves the problem I would be extremely impressed.p  pSo I turn to you regex gurus of Stack Overflow.

Negative 7315 pIs there a way for the app to wake up in background when remote push notification received and prevent iOS 78 from displaying notification alert similar to what can be done in Android using codeWakefulBroadcastReceivercode and  codeLocalBroadcastManagercode I was hopping that codedidReceiveRemoteNotification fetchCompletionHandlercode will allow to accomplish that, but looks like it is not designed for that purpose. With the realtime systems, servers sometimes have to push multiple notifications to the app and I want to prevent multiple alerts appearing on a users device, since only the last one matters.

V8 isolates have completely separate states. Objects from one isolate must not be used in other isolates. When V8 is initialized a default isolate is implicitly created and entered. The embedder can create additional isolates and use them in parallel in multiple threads. An isolate can be entered by at most one thread at any given time. The LockerUnlocker API can be used to synchronize.p  pexp 2 a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comv8getstarted relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comv8getstartedap  pAn isolate is a VM instance with its own heap.p  pOK, I see. Isolate is an isolate thread that can operate seperately. Followings are my questions.p  ol lipIt looks like just thread for me, except that it has its own heap. is there any differencepli lipI think Isolate can be used for implementing concurrent GC. The definition above says that each Isolate cannot be used in other Isolate. But concurrent GC should checkor mark the mainor other threador Isolates live objects. How can it be possiblepli lipHow can it be possible to protect their own objects Isolate is a thread not a process. So other thread can access that threads object if it knows the address. How could protect it And I cannot understand the meaning of own heap. Because it can be accessed by other thread if other thread knows the address. And normal thread can have their heap in memory space. Since address space of heap is not seperated exactly but if one thread malloc a memory, how could other thread use it unless others know the address Whats the difference each thread just malloc their own heap space and Isolate have its own heap spacepli ol  pMy questions can be easily summarized that what is the role of the Isolate and how can it be possible to have their own heap space and why does it have to have its own heap.p  pIt will be very helpful if someone shares some good documentations of Isolate. Thanks for reading.p  p Make the question clear  The key point of my question is that Q What makes google to implement isolate in V8 whats the benefit of isolate and what would be a good example of using isolate in V8 What are theyisolates executing concurrentlyp

So,  I tried adding an arc on top of the chart and adding a gaussian blur to it, but there are 2 issues with it it doesnt transition with the rest of the chart and the highlighting extends above the chart, I cant seem to get it to stay within the edges of the chart.p  pHeres an example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethf3adsj5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethf3adsj5ap  pThe code Im using to try to add the highlighting is as followsp  precodevar arc2  d3.svg.arc     .innerRadiusinnerRadius     .outerRadiusouterRadius     .startAngleMath.PI4     .endAngle712Math.PI  var filter2  defs.appendfilter     .attrid,highlight  filter2.appendfeGaussianBlur     .attrin,SourceAlpha     .attrstdDeviation,2     .attrresult,blur filter2.appendfeColorMatrix     .attrin, blur     .attrtype, matrix     .attrvalues, 0 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 1 0     .attrresult, whiteblur filter2.appendfeOffset     .attrin,whiteblur     .attrdx,3     .attrdy,3     .attrresult,offsetBlur  var feMerge2  filter2.appendfeMerge  feMerge2.appendfeMergeNode     .attrin,offsetBlur feMerge2.appendfeMergeNode     .attrin,SourceGraphic  svg.appendpath     .attrd,arc2     .stylefilter,urlhighlight codepre  pIs there a way to do this without adding the extra arc Or at least get it to transition like the drop shadow doesp

Negative 7315 pI know this has been asked a number of times but I cant figure out the answer from the answers here on StackOverflow or on the BioConductor install page a hrefhttpwww.bioconductor.orginstall relnofollowherea. I have installed and updated R to the latest 3.1.3 version which is explicitly stated to work with BioConductor 3.0 on the install page.p  pI then installed BioConductor and made sure everything was up to date using the following commandsp  precodesourcehttpbioconductor.orgbiocLite.R biocLiteaskFALSE biocLiteBiocUpgrade codepre  pEverything up to this point works just fine, but then when I go to install any of the BioConductor packages using, for examplep  precodebiocLitecflowCore codepre  pI will get a handful of errors like the followingp  precode1 In install.packagespkgs  pkgs, lib  lib, repos  repos, ...  installation of package robustbase had nonzero exit status codepre  pMy understanding is that this error is indicative of a version mismatch between R and the package and yet it sounds like everything from BioConductor should work with the R version 3.1.3.p  pWhen I try to install the the packages listed in the errors manually using, for examplep  precodeinstall.packagesrobustbase, dependenciesTRUE codepre  pAnd I will get the same type of error as above with the nonzero exit status.p  pDoes anybody know the best way of getting around this I assume I dont need to downgrade to a previous version of R or anything but Im really not sure what to do at this point.

Negative 7315 pCould someone suggest the best format to store geolocation coordinates into a websql database, would it be better to grab the values from an array and store in the format 52.8165972, 2.1174389000000247,52.8165972, 2.1174389000000247,52.8165972, 2.1174389000000247, with each bracket representing a set of coordinates lat,lng, or would it be better to separate lat and lng values into their own separate columnsp  pPlease bear in mind i will be using the coordinates stored within this database to plot a polyline onto google maps. The reason i currently have the structure stated above, is because google maps expects the format of the path values to be lat, lngp  pThe current concern is outputting from the database column, all the values in that format, so for example if its possible to output as 52.8165972, 2.1174389000000247, it may be possible to work with it easier.p  pAny advice would be highly appriciatedp  pEDIT Additional Information of the whole projectp  pI am building an application that is intended to track a users location whilst on walks. The mechanics behind the tracking and drawing a polyline in realtime all work perfectly. Upon finishing the walk, the user is taken to a second screen where additional details can be added such as walk titles, descriptions. Information such as the polyline path is output from an array onto the map so that the user can see it. Upon saving from this page, all the data is collected both from the arrays for that session and any information entered on that page and stored into its own auto incremental row in the table.p  pThere is another page where the users can view all the walks they have undertaken, this will list out all the individual walk details, and also display a map with that particular walks polyline added.p

However, it creates the codeall1bc649be34b1e6afc9b2419687cde016.jscode file under codewebassetscode. Yii creates a code.gitignorecode to ignore everything in that directory. None of the files will make it to Heroku. Even if I use codeheroku run yii asset assets.php configassetsprod.phpcode it will only create ephemeral files that are not accessible to the web dynos. As suspected it does fail in production.

Negative 7315 pIm working on a search engine using AWS CloudSearch although I think my question is relevant to search engines in general. Lets say I have a document to be indexed that has a text field called strongemNameemstrong with the value codeSomecompanycode. Currently, if I run a query such as codeSomecompanycode, then of course I get that document in the result. p  pHowever, if I run a query like codeSome companycode, then I dont get that same result. I have some basic understanding of search engines and an inverted index. I know that the reason Im not getting the document in the result is because the search engine index is strongonlystrong mapping the document with the token codeSomecompanycode. There might be separate document mappings in the index for the token codeSomecode and for the token codecompanycode, but regardless my document is not mapped to either of them and I wouldnt expect it to be.p  pIs it possible andor practical to index the search engine is such a way as to make the codeSome companycode search query find the codeSomecompanycode document that Im looking forp  pI would also like the reverse situation to work. So, if the document is indexed using the text field codeSome companycode, then Id like the query codeSomecompanycode to find that document.p  pThere is a solution that Ive been thinking about, but I suspect it might go against the principles of an inverted index and be very inefficient. If I index all my documents with an additional field that contains the strongemNameemstrong value compressed every character except letters and numbers removed, and preprocess every query by compressing the value in the same way, then it should work all my queries would be prefix searches.p  pMy concern with this solution is that the inverted index will be filled with unique tokens that only map to a single document. Is that a problem Is there an alternative solution p

Negative 7315 pI have an codeiPadcode app that uses thousands of codeUITextFieldscode and codeUITextViewscode throughout it. When text is being entered into these elements, the iOS default codekeyboardcode is used. However, because my app does not provide codedictationcode support, it crashes whenever the user attempts to dictate. Some research into the subject has shown that it isnt possible to disable the codedictationcode feature on the default codekeyboardcode. p  pInstead, I found that it is recommended to use a change the type of codekeyboardcode to one that doesnt offer a codedictationcode option.
