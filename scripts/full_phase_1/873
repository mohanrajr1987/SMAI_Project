Positive 873 pI am using Laravel as backbone of my web project. I want to create a notification system like the Facebook does for messages and notifications at the top. After reading, I found out that I can achieve what I try to do with Socket.io. However, I couldnt perfectly understand how to setup the logic.p  pLets say there will be different types of notification types, such asp  ul liUserX started following you,li liUserY wrote on your wall,li liUserZ sent you a messageli ul  pFirst, as far as I understand, the socket.io setup on client side [codeio.connectcode] should be called on every page master.blade in my case. On the server side, when a user connects to the server, it requires channel and message parameters to complete communication cycle.p  pHere is where I get confused. How is the logic works for my case I can understand the logic of public chat use, but couldnt figure out for notification system.p  pIs it like are all these sending notification info data function supposed to be triggered when inserting it to database with unique channel name maybe UID and preset messages for predefined actions eg. UserX started following youp  pBy that, I am planning to use Bootstrap dropdowns and appending the notification data in that dropdown with javascript.p

I would like to switch the colour, text, and href of Add Friend according to friendship table.p  pSo, if I am not friend with a person, when I go into persons page Add Friend will appear. This is done.

How can I access this columns, so I can make this if statement workp  pSecond question As you can see in the else statement, I use render to display buttons. So, after I make this if statement work with the help of you, I need to pass variable or somehow manipulate render from helper.

Positive 873 pIm trying to implement a serial addersubtractor in VHDL, Ive done it the ripple carry way before but now Im supposed to implement the same functionality by just using one full adder cell instead of Namount of cells so I have to shift the bits from the vectors in to the full addersubtractor and store the result in another vector which I just shift the index for as well... The logic behind it is very easily understood, you just have a counter for the index and so on. But I obviously encounter problems since Im probably still thinking a bit too much software programming I guess...p  pThe problem I have is that the counter increases to 1 right away when it enters the process so that when I try to add the vectors a  0101 0101 and b  1010 1010 I get y  1111 111X and the carrys  0000 000X.

Positive 873 pI have a logic question and I cannot figure out how to do it. First of all, I am working on an social networking site, and I completed the site in pure PHP, but now I am rewriting the backend in rails.p  pMy questions is, I generated UsersController, it has new, create, show, edit, update, delete, and destroy.p  pI thought I could use new to display sign up page, create to process sign up, show to display profile page, edit to display account settings and update to process edit.p  pI might have a logic problem here, maybe I should put new and create in a signup controller. This where I get confused. The problem with the first logic I said, I have 2 layouts, one of them is for before login, and the other one is for after login. You can imagine Facebooks header before login, and after login.p  pSo, when I have 2 different layout, I cannot use 1 controller in 2 layout. Because sign up page has before login header design and account settings and profile has after login header design. And as you can guess I define layout in controller.p  pI dont know if I explained well. Thank you.p

Positive 873 pThis is NOT about stored procedures or at least i dont think it is.p  pLets say i have a database. A database has some cities in it and events that take place in those cities. Some people are going to use this site and they want to get notified about certain events, when they enter the site. br  The rules for specifying what events they want to be notified about are supposed to be general.p  pFor example, i would want user to be able to say I want to be notified about all events, that will take place on sunday, in city that was founded between year 1200 and 1400, in the country which name starts with the letter F or which is in South America, which would be translate in pseudologiccode ofp  precode     event.date.day  Sunday    and    event.city.foundeddate.year.between1200, 1400     AND       event.city.country.startswithF   or   event.city.country.continent  South Africa    codepre  pThe rules like continent is, day is, foundation date is between et cetera are to be predefined, user will choose it, but i want to be able to add new rules in future.p  pWhat is the best way to store such logic The only solution i can come up with is a NotificationGatherer model. It would contain id of a user, and a string with json. I would create a json binary tree, for this particular case, the capitalized AND would be a root with two children  the inner and and inner or. The first children would have two simple conditions, which would reflect the actual conditions as abive.p  pThen i would have a method thats called on users request, which would eitherbr p  ol lipEvaluate the value truefalse of this conditions set for all upcoming eventsp  porpli lipForm a queryset with filters, which would fetch all the upcoming events that satisfy given conditions much more difficult and much more efficient.pli ol  pNow, is this even a good approach, or should i try something else It seems rather complex I already see how painful it would be to test it, and i can imagine that a lot of people could have needed something like this in the past, yet i cant find any suggestions, because any searching for logic in database automatically points me to articlesquestions about stored procedures.p  pIf that makes any difference, Im using django and mysql.p

Positive 873 pIm working on a pointofsale system that uses unique alphanumeric UPC codes as an identity column in the database. The user is allowed to enter any alphanumeric UPC code that they want. I want to implement an autogenerate option for the UPC using C and Linq to Entity, but am having some trouble with the logic. Im trying to get it into the format A0000000010, where A would denote the product type, and the numbers after are either random, or a counted number, they really dont matter. Heres my basic schemap  precodeproductID    description    UPC    1          ItemNum1     12345    2          ItemNum2     ABCDE codepre  pI can easily create a random number and attach it to the letter, then check if it exists in the database, and if it does, try it again, and again and again, but a brute force method seems like it could take a lot of time down the road, so Id like to avoid this.p  pI also thought I could grab the last productID column 2 in this case, increment it now its 3, attach the requisite 0s 0000000003, and then attach the correct letter A0000000003, but since users can create their own UPCs by hand, or by scanning, they could easily type in a UPC like A0000000015 that would affect this down the line. p  pTo get around that, I could do something where if the UPC already exists, decrement the id so A0000000003 would become A0000000002, and try again, and again, and again, and now were back at the brute force method, albeit a much faster one.p  pMy question is Is there a way, using C and Linq to Entity, to generate a string that is guaranteed not to exist in the databasep

Negative 873 pI have a set of ComboBoxs in an MS Access 2003 DB that are all bound to fields in a single table.

Negative 873 pI have written a C library which has a method to count words from multiple passages of text in parrallel.  The passages of text are given as character streams where there is a random delay each time codegetnextcharcode is called.  My library method has to take an array of these character streams and return a combined wordfrequency count.  To do this I have a safely shared wordfrequency data structure and a thread to read each character stream and update the shared collection.  When all the threads have completed then I return the data structure to the client application.p  pThe client application needs interim results of the combined word counting every 10 seconds. To do this I use a delegate to call back the client every 10 seconds with the results untill all of the worker threads have completed, after which I return the final results to the client.p  pMy problem is that when I callback the client with the interim results I have to lock my shared data structure and wait for the client application to return from the callback before I can unlock it. Whilst the callback is executing all of the worker threads are blocked waiting for the lock on the data structure.  This doesnt seem like a sensible thing to do, because I dont think I should rely or trust the client code to return promptly or even at all. However they only other way I can think of doing it which does not rely on the client code is to make a copy or snapshot of my data structure and pass that to the client through the callback.  This is at the expense of memory and computation but once the copy is made the workers can continue updating the shared collection and the callback can do whatever it wants.p  pMy question is two fold p  p1 Which is the lesser of two evils, allowing the possibility of a bad client callback implementation to block the workers, or periodically performing an expensive operation.  p  p2Is there a way to solve this problem which doesnt do either of the above p

Negative 873 pI am looking to introduce a logging framework into our existing Oracle application to replace the use of DBMSOUTPUT. p  pThe framework will be used primarly to aid debugging and would detail such things as starting x procedure, details of parameters, ending procedure x etc. It should also have the functionality to be turned on for all or just one program unit, various levels of trace in fact what is pretty much standard logging functionality.p  pImplementing these requirements should be relatively straightforward, however where I would like your help is how best to turn this functionality off and on. What I am trying to achieve is the smallest possible performance hit when the trace is turned off.

Unfortunately I have had to grudgingly abandon this idea as most of the application is built using standalone procedures amp functions so turning on a logging functionality could potentially invalidate a lot of code. p  pI have had look a several existing opensource and others frameworksfunctionality for inspiration p  pstronglog4plsql a hrefhttplog4plsql.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttplog4plsql.sourceforge.netastrong p  pAPCs review a hrefhttpradiofreetooting.blogspot.com200506oraclelogginginplsql.html relnofollowherea  especially under acceptable impact gives me concerns.p  pstrongOraLog project a hrefhttporalog.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttporalog.sourceforge.neta strongp  pNo updates since 2007p  pstrongPLVISIONstrong a hrefhttpwww.toadworld.comDownloadsExclusiveToadWorldSoftwaretabid78TID158cid64Default.aspx relnofollowhereap  pLooks quite old, no changes since Oracle 8ip  pstrongAsk Tom Instrumentationstrong a hrefhttpasktom.oracle.complsasktomzpurlASKTOM2Edownloadfile3Fpfile3D5466674809774155519amppcatinstrumentation.zippcompany822925097021874 relnofollowhereap  pstrongUpdate 01042014strong a hrefhttpasktom.oracle.complsapexfp1001103a3a3a3aP11QUESTIONID54174245781686 relnofollowTom Kytea now recommends Tyler Muths a hrefhttpsgithub.comtmuthLoggerAPLSQLLoggingUtility relnofollowLoggerap  pI would be really interested to hear your experiences if you have introduced some form of logging into your Oracle application, how you implemented it and especially how you control it.p
Negative 873 pIm working on some C code for an embedded system.  The IO interface the code uses requires that the size of each message in bytes is a power of two.  Right now, the code does something like this in several placesp  precodepragma pack1 struct Message     struct internal           unsigned long member1       unsigned long member2       unsigned long member3        more members      internal    char pad[64sizeofinternal]  pragma pack codepre  pIm trying to compile the code on a 64bit Fedora for the first time, where codelongcode is 64bits.  In this case, codesizeofinternalcode is greater than 64, the array size expression underflows, and the compiler complains that the array is too large.p  pIdeally, Id like to be able to write a macro that will take the size of the structure and evaluate at compile time the required size of the padding array in order to round the size of the structure out to a power of two.p  pIve looked at the a hrefhttpgraphics.stanford.eduseanderbithacks.html relnofollowBit Twiddling Hacksa page, but I dont know if any of the techniques there can really be implemented in a macro to be evaluated at compile time.p  pAny other solutions to this problem  Or should I perpetuate the problem and just change the magical 64 to a magical 128p
Negative 873 pI know that ARM actually has some support for Java and SUN obviously, but I havent really references seen any chip vendor supporting a .Net JIT compiler.  I know IBM and Intel both support C compilers, as well as TI and many of the embedded chip vendors.  When you think of it, all a JIT compiler is, is the last stages of compilation and optimization which you would think would be a good match for a chip vendors expertize.  Perhaps a standardized Plug In compilation engine for the VM would make sense.p  pMicrosoft is targeting .Net to embedded Windows platforms as well, so they are fair game.  p  pPetep

Negative 873 pIt gets basicaly to this  I have a canvas container xnameContainer  to reffer later to, with some other controlse.g. I have a Button 30x60 in size and I want to scale the Container to fit the button, without having to resize anything. just using scaleTransform  If I set a slider binded to the Container Scale, I can slide it to fit the button, but the value is 1.1343 and I want to be able somehow to compute this value programatically, because all the controls inside Container are of different sizes, and resizable in adition.  The question is is there a way to scale the Container so that a Control from the container is displayed on the entire Container surface Also the position will have to be adjusted, so that the scrolling vierew of the Container should be positioned over the control, but that is done already.p  pThank you in advance,  Danielp

Negative 873 pThe java meomry model mandates that codesynchronizecode blocks that synchronize on the same monitor enforce a beforeafterrealtion on the variables modified within those blocks. Examplep  precode in thread A synchronized lock     x  true    in thread B synchronized lock     System.out.println x   codepre  pIn this case it is garanteed that thread B will see codextruecode as long as thread A already passed that codesynchronizedcodeblock. Now I am in the process to rewrite lots of code to use the more flexible and said to be faster locks in codejava.util.concurrentcode, especially the codeReentrantReadWriteLockcode. So the example looks like thisp  pemEDITem The example was broken, because I incorrectly transformed the code, as noted by emmatt bem. Fixed as followsp  precode in thread A lock.writeLock.lock    x  true  lock.writeLock.unlock   in thread B lock.readLock.lock    System.out.println x   lock.readLock.unlock codepre  pHowever, I have not seen any hints within the memory model specification that such locks also imply the nessessary ordering. Looking into the implementation it seems to rely on the access to volatile variables inside codeAbstractQueuedSynchronizercode for the sun implementation at least. However this is not part of any specification and moreover access to nonvolatile variables is not really condsidered covered by the memory barrier given by these variables, is itp  pSo, here are my questionsp  ul liIs it safe to assume the same ordering as with the old codesynchronizedcode blocksli liIs this documented somewhereli liIs accessing any volatile variable a memory barrier for any other variableli ul  pRegards,   Steffenp  pp  pComment to Yanamonp  pLook at the following codep  precode in thread a x  1 synchronized  a   y  2  z  3   in thread b System.out.println x  synchronized  a   System.out.println y   System.out.println z  codepre  pFrom what I understood, the memory barrier enforces the second output to show 2, but has no guaranteed affect on the other variables... So how can this be compared to accessing a volatile variablep

Negative 873 pI need to visualize a graph of a hrefhttpyfrog.comizgraph1mjthis kinda. I dont know how to name it by the way, if you know  Ill appreciate if you tell me. It would be ideal for graph elements to be clickable so that when user clicks on a block, I can handle an event with the element id specified but I can survive even without any interactivity. I may like to be able to focus on a particular node and layout all others to view from its perspective. Are there any components available good for this task If no, what should I look for to help me to develop an algorithm for drawing such a graph with visuallycomfortable layoutp  pPractical nature of this graph is pretty common each block represents a derivation from 2 operands. Orange circles are references to 2 operands, green circles are connection points to consumers. It can be significant to distinguish an operand position left or right, for example if a derivation represents a mathematical operation of difference or division in this particular case a block can be triangular, but in other cases an operand itself can make use of being aware of for what blocks is it a left operand and for what blocks is it a right. Another common application is intersecting sets with complex relations.p

When we build COM DLLs, we still rely on the traditional DLL export methods to lead us to the internal COM coclasses. p  pIf COM is for component reusing at the binary level, I think the traditional DLL can achieve the same thing. They both expose functions, they are both binary, so whats the point of turning to COM approachp  pCurrently, I have the feeling that the traditional DLL expose methods in a strongflatstrong manner, while the COM DLL expose methods in an strongOOPstrong hierarchy manner.

At the moment, the Template listens for the click mouseevent and then uses a switch statement to get the initial target of the event, egp  precodeprotected function onTitleBarClickeMouseEventvoid    switch e.target     case titleBar.settingsButton             addSettings             break            etc..        codepre  pWould there be any advantage or is it desirable to port this into a custom event system, either extending the native Event class or maybe even as3signals so that the titlebar itself has the click listener and then dispatches an event that TemplateMain picks up and then acts accordingly One negative of this I can see is that, along with mouse click listener, Id end up with another six listeners for the custom events.p  pLike I said, maybe it doesnt matter but Id like to know how others handle this very common situation.p

Negative 873 pI am trying to create an app that will perform actions on specific times much like the Windows Task Scheduler. I am currently using Process.Start to launch the file or exe required by the task.p  pI am initiating a process by calling a file an .mp3 and the process starts WMP since it is the default application.  So far so good. Now I want to kill that process. I know that it is normal behavior for the Process.Startstring, string to return nothing null in C in this case.p  pSo I am asking how can I close WMP when I called it through Process.Startstring, stringp  pEditp  pPlease note that I am not opening WMP directly with Process.Start and this is the line with which I run the processp  pBlockquoteVB Me.procs.AddProcess.StartMe.procInfop  pC this.procs.AddProcess.Startthis.procInfoBlockquotep  pprocInfo is a ProcessStartInfo instance. procInfo.FileName is CroutemyFile.mp3. That is why WMP opens. In any case, all of the Start methods, except for the instanceone which returns a boolean, return nothing null in C, because WMP is not the process that was directly created please note that WMP is run and the song does play.p

Negative 873 pSeparation between API design and their implementation is often recommended in large software implementations. But somewhere, they have to be reconnected i.e., the implementation has to be reconnected to the API.p  pThe following example shows an API design and an invocation of its implementation via the INSTANCE objectp  precodeimport java.util.List  public abstract class Separation       public static final Separation INSTANCE  new SeparationImpl       Defining a special list     public static interface MySpecialListltTgt extends ListltTgt          void specialAddT item            Creation of a special list     public abstract ltTgt MySpecialListltTgt newSpecialListClassltTgt c       Merging of a special list     public abstract ltTgt MySpecialListlt extends Tgt specialMerge         MySpecialListlt super Tgt a, MySpecialListlt super Tgt b       Implementation of separation     public static class SeparationImpl extends Separation           Override         public ltTgt MySpecialListltTgt newSpecialListClassltTgt c              return ...

Even if we separate API code from implementation via separate files, one often has to import implementation code at least the class name in the API.p  pThere are techniques to avoid such references by using a string representation of the fully qualified name. The class is loaded with that string and then instantiated. It makes the code more complicated.p  pMy question Is there any benefit to completely separate or isolate API code from implementation code Or is this just a purists attempt to reach perfection with little practical benefitsp

I dont want to display this at the bottom of the table because several users add rows to that table frequently and they destroyed the formulas on a regular basis.p  pstrongProblemstrong whenever a user adds data to the end of the table, one would need to update the SUM and SUBTOTAL formulas to expand the range which  needless to say  is mostly forgotten.p  pI could myself extend the formulas to cover all rows up to say row 500 and hide the remaining rows, so a user would need to insert rows when the visible end of the table is reached  which in turn would update the formulas, but I dont regard this as a very safe way ... knowing my users.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a way to create SUM and SUBTOTAL from X6 strongemto the end of column X wherever that isemstrongp  pstrongCONCLUSIONstrongp  pI used SUMOFFSET...., taking the height parameter from a new field in the header that displays the number of records by a codeCOUNTAAA1code 1 for the column heading text that is counted as well, as it is clear from the business context that a key value must exist in column A for any valid data record and no blank rows are allowed I can train uses that much at least  plus the user benefit of not only seeing the SUM but now as well the COUNT of records in the header frozen pane.p

Negative 873 pI have set up a site using Wordpress as my CMS. I am using the site as a portfolio to show off my frontend web dev skills and have another area of the site for a blog. I got around the issue of having 2 blogs on the site by giving posts a category of either Projects or Blog.p  pThe front page of my site contains thumbnails and links to Recent Projects. When you click through you are taken to a Project Detail page which uses Single.php to display a single post. The TwentyTen theme which I have edited comes with pagination so that when you are on the Project Detail page you can also click through to the next or previous post. However there does not seem to be any restriction on the category so you can also click through to Blog posts. I want the user to only be able to click through to other Projects.p  pI have googled around this issue and seem to find suggestions to use custom queries but none of the solutions suggested seem to work. p  pI only want to display one post at a time on Single.php and have pagination which lets me link to the next or previous Project post.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 873 pI am writing a library that includes an interface to returnreceive codesharedptrcode objects.p  pEverything seemed just dandy until I was reminded that an application using my library could have a different CRT version as well as STL version.p  pthis begs two questionsp  ol lipif STL versions differ between my .lib and the app using it, how can I make sure the same version of codesharedptrcode is being used across my lib and app STL doesnt provide binary compatibilitypli liplets say I solved question 1 by copying STLs header defining codesharedptrcode and renaming it to codemysharedptrcode or in any way that now gives me the same codesharedptrcode implementation across my lib and the app. since this is a template class, and CRT versions differ, how can I make sure a codenewcode has the matching codedeletecode If my lib compiles codemysharedptrltSomeClassgtcode and the app compiles codemysharedptrltSomeClassgtcode, each compilation sticks in its own codenewcode and codedeletecode according to the CRT version. Now when I create and hand a codesharedptrcode from the app to my lib to destroy when done with it, mismatching codenewcode and codedeletecode might be called.pli ol  pAm I right to assume two instantiations of codemysharedptrltSomeClassgtcode are to be compiled, one by the .lib and one by the appp  pThanks for any help, Leop

Negative 873 pI ran into a problem when making a carousel with jQuery. It works just fine with Chrome, FF, IE7 and IE9. IE8 is the only one with problems.p  pThe carousel has items floating side by side, and when an item is clicked, its width is extended to show the content. And if clicked again, it retracts back to its original width.p  pThe problem is that when I click one of the items item1 it doesnt work. And when I take a look at it with IEs dev tools, I can clearly see that it is in fact open. It just doesnt render the change. Then if I click the element right of the item1 item2, item1 jumps to the extented width without animating. If I click item1 again, it retracts back to original width and this is where the problem occurs. Item2 is still far to the right when it should be right next to item1.p  pI replicated this problem with a much simpler example than my original project, since its quite big.

The way I do this is to create an entry in the DB together with the path and then use the LoadControl method.p  pI can see I can do this with partial views, but partial views have no code behind. If Ive potentially got 100 controls that people can drop onto a page, does this mean that the ViewBag in the controller needs to cater for all 100 controls just in case they are used on the view For example, a web forms user control will contain logic rptItems.DataSource  blah rptItems.DataBindp  pWith MVC, Im assuming that logic will be in the view controller and the view would access it by the ViewBag Im a little confused at how to do this.p  pSecondly, how would you handle deep routingp  pEG p  pStoreProductsCategory is fine, but what about StoreProductsCategoryDeliveryUK  Would I need to set up a route in global.asax for each route I need In web forms, I just called the ReWritePath method and handled the routing myself using regular expressions.p  pThanks for the time to read this, and hopefully answer some of my queriesp

Negative 873 pI know that A algorithm implementation problems are relatively common on stackoverflow Ive been through a lot of other postings. I have been trying for the past couple of days to implement a simple C A system. I am only allowing movement in four directions no diagonal checking, so this should be an especially simple task this is also why I only have a heuristic as my cost. Also, I have stepped through the code and, for all starting positions, an object is able to successfully find a valid path to the target. The issue, however, is that I am unable to step back through the parent pointers and store the path  movement sequence.

Now if a and b are NOT empty and c  100 and the ListStyle  3700, I want to change the value of ListStyle to 3699 so that when I print out a result loop, rows that match the condition code a  , b  , c  100 and ListStyle  3700code will then be shown above the rows that have the ListStyle of 3700p  pI cant simply edit the data in the database, even though that would be an easy solution. The data has to stay as it is.p  pI originally tried doing this in php. While its easy enough to change the value of the ListStyle using if statements, I dont know of an easy way to then actually order my results without sticking everything into an array and then sorting through it.

Negative 873 pI have a bit of a strange question. First let me tell you i cannot change the way the database is made. Some people before me made a really good job of messing some things up pretty bad.p  pIts a news site and there are editors in that can edit the news posts that others post. also editors can post news them self.p  pNow the question.p  precodeI have a table for news.  id     newsusername    who post news   newstext Table  newsid    username    newstext     Here user can be editor of the news or a person who  posted news  User Table  username   title  codepre  pIn that table there is a news id and a news username. The username being the username of the user posting the news. there are also allot more fields inside the table but they are not important.p  pThen there is a table newstext and within it the text for the news is placed. This table has a newsid and username field. This time the username is the field of the person who posted the news OR the username of the user that edited the post.p  pThen i have a user table with also a username field and a title field with the title for the user. In this p  pHope your still with me.p  pIn short if a user posts a news article the text will be inside the newstext table and when an editor edits the post the altered text will be inserted as a new text for the same article. This is done to let the original poster see what was altered to his post.p  pnow comes my challenge. I need to figure out how i can get the number of edits that an editor made. BUT because the editor itself can post news that means that i need to search for all news where the username is not equal to the original poster and where it is look for duplicates in the newstext table to see of the editor has edited his own post.p  pi really hope people understand a little of what i need to do. hope you can help me.p  hr  pin the comment  Marcus Adams pointed me at the how the latest edit was used on the website.p  pThis is don through a datetime field. When an edit is placed the edit will be inserted into the newstext field and there will be datetime stamp for the new edit. And with that it will determine witch text to grab for the news item.p  phope this is clearp

How do I tell EF not to join just because there is a relationship. Basically I just want a simple row from that table. p  pOr do I need to use a different type of retrieval.

I turned off LazyLoading and turned it on and didnt really notice too much of a performance difference there.

ListltMyCustomDataSource.Jobsgt myJobs  MyCustomDataSource.Jobs.GetJobs1031  codepre  pI fully understand that Entity Framework is doing way way more than a standard SqlConnection, but why all this hype if it is going to take at a minimum of 25x more memory for a result set. Just doesnt seem worth it.p  pMy solution is not to go with EF after all. p

Negative 873 pstrongThe Back Storystrongp  pA little while back, I was asked if we could implement a mass email solution in house so that we would have better control over sensitive information.  I proposed a two step plan Develop a prototype in ExcelVBACDO for user familiarity, then phase a .NetSQL server solution for speed and robustness.p  pstrongWhats Changedstrongp  p3 Months into the 2nd phase, management decides to go ahead and outsource email marketing to another company, which is fine.  The 1st problem is that management has not made a move on a company to go through, so I am still implicity obligated to make the current prototype work.  p  pStill, the prototype works, or at least it did.  The 2nd problem came when our Exchange 2003 Relay Server got switched with Exchange 2010.  Turns out that more safety features are turned by default like Throttling Policies, which I have been helping the sysadmin iron out a server config that works.  Whats happening is that the after 100 emails get sent, the server starts rejecting the send requests with the following errorp  precodeThe message could not be sent to the SMTP server. The transport error code is 0x800ccc67.  The server response was 421 4.3.2 The maximum number of concurrent connections has exceeded a limit, closing transmission channel codepre  pUnfortunately, we only get to test the server configuration when Marketing has something to send out, which is about once per month.p  pstrongWhats Nextstrongp  pI am looking at Excels VBA Timer Function to help throttle my main loop pump to help throttle the send requests.  The 3rd problem here is, from what I understand from reading, is that the best precision I can get is 1 second on the timer.  1 email per second would be considerably longer  about 4x5x longer as oppossed to the 5 emailsec we have been sending at.  This turns a 3 hour process into a an all day process past the hours of staff availability.  I suppose I can invert the rate by sending 5 emails for every second that passes, but the creates more of a burst affect as opposed a steady rate if had more precision on the timer. In my opinion, this creates a less controlled process and I am not sure how the server will handle bursts as opposed a steady rate.  strongWhat are my optionsstrongp

Negative 873 pConsider the followingp  precodepublic class SomeService      public Task StartAsync              return Task.Factory             .StartNew gt DoStartup           public Task StopAsync              return Task.Factory             .StartNew gt DoShutdown       codepre  pThe problem with the above is that if multiple calls to either codeStartAsynccode or codeStopAsynccode are made then multiple tasks will be created to startstop the service. Realistically, one would only want a single startstop task active at any one time. To that end, I usually do something like thisp  precodepublic class SomeService      private readonly object startSync  new object     private readonly object stopSync  new object     private Task startTask     private Task stopTask      public Task StartAsync              var startTaskLocal  this.startTask          if startTaskLocal  null                      return startTaskLocal                   lock this.startSync                      if this.startTask  null                              return this.startTask                           this.startTask  Task.Factory                 .StartNew gt DoStartup                 .Thenx gt                                              lock this.stopSync                                                      this.stopTask  null                                                            return this.startTask                    public Task StopAsync               similar pattern to above       codepre  pNow whilst this works, its kind of ugly. Before I get too far ahead of myself in trying to encapsulate this pattern into something small and reusable, Im wondering whether there is an already established way of doing so that I am unaware ofp  pPS. I extend this idea even further by having codeStartAsynccode wait for any outstanding codeStopAsynccode call, and viceversa. That means that only one start OR stop operation can be in progress at any one time. This is pretty easy to do via task composition. If I can first find out whether theres an established way of neatly achieving the above, I can then figure out whether it fits in with this extended behavior.p

I was thinking I am looking at it the wrong way. p  pI realize the title of my question might be wrong, I dont really know how storing data this way is called.p  pstrongHere is the solution I used based on Matthews answerstrongp  pHere is what I ended up with   p  precode SELECT          o.title,         o.id,         op1.value AS startdate,         op2.value AS enddate    FROM object o    JOIN objectmetavalues op1 ON op1.objectido.id AND op1.objecttypemetaid28    JOIN objectmetavalues op2 ON op2.objectido.id AND op2.objecttypemetaid29    WHERE objecttypeid  11    AND 12      lt op1.value AND op1.value lt  16          OR 12       lt  op2.value   AND op2.value   lt 16          OR op1.value lt 12        AND 16        lt op2.value   codepre  p.

Negative 873 pI have a need for a pattern interpretation and rule generating system.

Lets say i have an HTTP header which looks likep  precodeGET httpswebsite.comapi1.0download8hqcdzt9oaq8llapjai1bpp2q27p14ah2139379149 HTTP1.1 Host website.com UserAgent net.me.me2.7.1OSiOS5.0.1AppleiPad 2 GSM Accept  AcceptLanguage enus AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate codepre  pThe parser would run through this and outputp  precodereqhdrpattern GET[ ].api1.0downloadSTRINGauthtokenSTRINGid[].website.com codepre  pThe above rule contains a modified version of regex. Each variable e.g STRINGauthtoken or STRINGid is to be extracted.p  pFor parsing through the textheader in this case i will have to tell the parser that it needs to extract whatever comes after the download. So basically there is a definition of a set of rules which this parser will use to parse through the text and eventually output the final rule.p  pNow the question is, is there any such module available in python for pattern matching,detection,generation that can help me with this This is somewhat like a compilers parser part. I wanted to ask before going deep into trying to make one myself. Any help p

Negative 873 pEDIT I changed the CDI injections points from using EJB to using Inject as indicated in my below comments. Just an FYI.p  hr  pI have two EAR projects, both basically the same.  The only difference they have are a few client specific implementations, where required.  My having problem, however.  p  pThis is what I havep  pEAR 1 contains the following modulesp  precodeweb.war  ejbdefault.jar ejbclient1.jar codepre  pEAR 2 contains the following modulesp  precodeweb.war ejbdefault.jar ejbclient2.jar codepre  pIn ejbdefault contains the followingp  precodeSingleton Startup public class ApplicationSettingsBean implements ApplicationSettingsBeanLocal codepre  pNow, for EAR 1, the ejbclient1.jar might be empty, so any EJB injections should use whatever is in ejbdefault.p  pFor EAR 2, however, I want to override the default implementation with a client specific one.  For examplep  precodeSingleton Startup     Alternative public class ApplicationSettingsBean implements ApplicationSettingsBeanLocal  codepre  pI also created the following beans.xml entry in ejbclient2p  precodeltbeans xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee        xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance        xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee httpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeebeans10.xsdgt     ltalternativesgt         ltclassgtcom.client2.ejb.ApplicationSettingsBeanltclassgt     ltalternativesgt ltbeansgt codepre  pI would expect that the Alternative implementation would be injected when such an implementation exists.  If Default is specified at the injection point, then the default implementation ejbdefault should be injected.  Though, that doesnt happenp  precode     Inject the alternative implementation     Inject     private ApplicationSettingsBeanLocal appSettingsBean codepre  pWith this CDI, the default is being injected, not the alternative.  Thats not the expected behavior.p

When you click the right side of a column header, a down arrow appears indicating theres a menu.  When you click that arrow, a menu drops down.  In any other HTML application based menu or desktop app menu, you can either hover over a [sub] menu option or click the [sub] menu option and the next sub menu pops out.  In the case of the Ext.grid.Panel, when you click a menu option on the main header menu hoping to expand the nested submenu, the entire root column header menu disappears.  This would be represented as an enhancement by Sencha since there is a workaroundthat being dont click on the menu option Columns.  It still works if you dont click, but its just not intuitive.  Who is bright enough to fix this in the extjs 4 framework code  p

I also do not wish to duplicate the rules in my style sheet for either newTable or some new class applied to newTable.p  pHow can this be accomplished  Thank youp  pCSSp  precode.general some CSS .general thead some CSS .general thead th some CSS  originalTable some CSS originalTable thead some CSS originalTable thead th  some CSS codepre  pHTMLp  precodelttable idoriginalTable classgeneralgt     lttheadgt         lttrgt             ltthgtH1ltthgt             ltthgtH2ltthgt             ltthgtH3ltthgt         lttrgt     lttheadgt     lttbodygt         lttrgt             ltthgtB1ltthgt             ltthgtB2ltthgt             ltthgtB3ltthgt         lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegt  lttable idnewTable classgeneralgt     lttheadgt         lttrgt             ltthgtH1ltthgt             ltthgtH2ltthgt             ltthgtH3ltthgt         lttrgt     lttheadgt     lttbodygt         lttrgt             ltthgtB1ltthgt             ltthgtB2ltthgt             ltthgtB3ltthgt         lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegt codepre

Negative 873 pIm having some issues with a website that only occur in Safari. Im running version 5.1.7 7534.57.2 on a Mac. p  pYou can view the site here a hrefhttpmcad.eduannualreport201112 relnofollowhttpmcad.eduannualreport201112a. p  pThe website is parallax scrolling, with a relative positioned content div that holds everything, including the 3 parallax scrolling backgrounds which are all fixed, top and left set to 0. p  pWithin the fixed parallax background containers, colorized images fade into full color images when a user mouses over them. For each image, there are two divs stacked, each with background images that are positioned by backgroundposition. The div on the bottom has the colorized image. The div on top has the full color image as a background and has its opacity set to 0 until mouseover. The fade is achieved using a CSS transition on the opacity property so that the top div becomes visible.p  pSo, in Safari only, when I mouse over any of these divs, the transition occurs smoothly but all of the content in the same parallax scrolling background div shiftsjumps in the process. If I remove the CSS transition, this does not occur.  p  pI think that it might have something to do with the transitionwebkittransition property not playing nicely with a fixed position container in Safari. However, all of the issues Ive found that relate to that are from 2010 and mention a Safari bug that I assume has been fixedtwo years later. But maybe not. p  pTheres also another issue with the Catalyst section 3rd dot down on the right navigation. These animated images work as links in Chrome, Firefox and Opera, but not Safari. Any ideasp

Negative 873 pI would like to speed up the process of validating a batch of XML files against the same single XML schema XSD.

Negative 873 pIm building a TCP client based on BoostASIO lib. I used codereadsomecode from Boost to read the response from the server. I want to implement a time out logic in it, which send a ping command if there has been no communication for 10 seconds. The problem is p  precodelsocketgtreadsomeboostasiobufferthisgtreply,sizeofthisgtreply,error codepre  pseems to block the program execution when there is no data to be transferred to the read buffer. So is there any way out of it I didnt want to use the codeasyncreadsomecode as I need this thread to sleep if there is no data has been transferred in to the buffer, that was easily done in codereadsomecode as it returns the size of data transferred. The main thing is even during timeout I dont want to close the connection, but to check if the server responds to a ping command, if it doesnt I would move to reconnection. So this is more or less checking if the server is still there connected, when no data is transmitted over a time period.p

Negative 873 pIve been recently using embedXcode for some Arduino related projects. Those who are familiar to Arduino knows that a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiIntellisense relnofollowcode sensea is not an option you can get in the Arduino IDE. Thats why embedXcode gives you the freedom to get the code sense of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXcode relnofollowXcodea along with the other functionalities in Arduino IDE.p  pNow the problem Im having is even though the standard C code are recognised by Xcode, it cant yet recognise the Arduinospecific codes. For example, in codevoid loopcode, codevoidcode is highlighted but not codeloopcode. In the same way while typing pinMo... Its not showing any suggestions. As it was mentioned in the embedXcode tutorial, after running the automatic project configuration, the code sense should work. But I couldnt figure out any solution. Am I doing something wrong or is there any little tweak Im missingp

This also works for me.  I also want to find positional coordinates of the display relative to the desktop area.  Looking at the information in Windows Dev Center on the DEVMODE structure, I see there is also a dmPosition parameter that is a POINTL structure.  This has been left out of the DEVMODE type definition above and when I add it, dmPelsWidth and dmPelsHeight no longer retrieve the right info.p  pWhy was dmPosition omitted above, and why is the retrieved info no longer working when I include itp  pLink to the example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7785835findsizeofexternalmonitorinexcelvbafind size of external monitor in excel vbaap
Negative 873 pIm working on a Durandal SPA, and Ive setup some views and viewmodels.  Im unclear how I should be creating model objects on the client side.  For instance, lets say that I want to define and create Person model object.p  pEverything else in my app is defined AMD style.  This allows DurandalRequireJS to automatically load up the files it needs.p  pSo, my first thought was that I might define my Person model type in a modelsperson.js file, like thisp  precodedefinefunction       var id  ko.observable0     var firstname  ko.observable     var lastname  ko.observable      return           id id,         firstname firstname,         lastname lastname,       codepre  pHowever, I dont think this is right, because from here I dont think theres a way to actually create individual Person objects.  For instance, lets say I wanted to create two Person objects.  DurandalRequireJS will happily load in my Person module, but its just one objectand I may want to create another instance of the Person type, or five more instances, etc.p  pWhats the appropriate way to do this  Thanks for helping clear up my confusionp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Ive gotten some responses that explain some ways to do this.  I think my confusion stemmed from the fact that a module is not a type, or a class.  Its more like a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSingletonpattern relnofollowsingleton objecta.  So if you want to define a type, and put it inside a module, you need to create module that is, essentially, a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFactory28softwareconcept29 relnofollowfactorya.p  pIs that rightp  pA factory makes sense in this case.  But, I have a clarifying question is this a factory the accepted method for defining model types in a DurandalRequireJSAMD style JavaScript app  Im sure Im not the first person to run into this issue.  Im wondering how it has been solved before, and especially if there is an accepted convention in the AMD world on how to define reusable types.p

Negative 873 pIm new to AngularJS, so forgive me if this is a noob question. The documentation is pretty terse, so I may have missed something obviousp  pIm considering migrating a bunch of custom inhouse code to Angular, and I have to make Angular work with our REST pattern, in which an input looks like thisp  precodefoo     value 100,    min 50,    max 150  codepre  pValue becomes the value displayed in an codeinputcode element, and min and max are currently bound to min and max attributes. These are later picked up by a validation function. If value is outside of the minmax range, it is adjusted back into that range.p  pAnyway, Im trying to do something likep  precodeltinput typetext ngmodelfoo mybind gt codepre  p... and override codengModelcode with a directive named codemyBindcode to manage the relationship, so that the value is read and written to codefoo.valuecode. p  pI would then use a custom validator later to handle the minmax attributes.p  pCan anyone provide an example of how I might achieve such a binding Ive not had much luck making it work so far.p  p... or maybe my whole approach is stupid I do have to work with the data structure above though, I cant change that in the near future.p

Negative 873 pWorking on a data warehouse and am looking for suggestions on having numerous dimensions versus on large dimension with attributes.  p  pWe currently have DimEntity, DimStation, DimZone, DimGroup, DimCompany and have multiple fact tables that contain the keys from each of the dimensions.

Performance and maintainability are important.  These dimensions do not change often so looking for guidance on the best way to handle such dimensions. p  pFact tables have over 100 million records.  The entity dimension has around 1000 records and the others listed have under 200 each.p
Negative 873 pI have a very weird session issue  some odd cross session problem that has me baffled.p  pBasically I have an express 3 app in which I have 2, seemingly unrelated things  one is a standard contact form that someone can use to email me and the other is an API call to mailchimp to add subscribers when they place an order. These are 2 completely different callsactions.p  pAt the top of my contact form I have a check for the variable error which I can use in my controller code to say something such as invalid email or other error message. My contact form has 2 controller actions  one for GET which shows the form and one for POST which submits and shows errors if any.p  pThe issue is this  when I load the contact form initially I see this message Error someoneexample.com is already subscribed to list General. Click here to update your profile. which is a MailChimp message  not only unrelated to the process but unrelated to my session  This error can happen if a returning customer places and order and they are already subscribed. I dont ever show them this message not, as far as I can tell, actually store it. So I am confused.p  pOne thing to note is that the order part is called from the node server upon receiving an xml file from the payment gateway so not a regular session user  so maybe there are some session internals I am not understanding.p  pThe code is below but heres a summary of the issue. A node server, without a user session active, is making an API call to mailchimp to add a subscriber using this a hrefhttpsgithub.comgomfunkelnodemailchimpmodulea  It is common that the same email will be subscribed twice so mailchimp will reply with an already subscribed message which I emdo noemt store or load in Expresss error locals.  Then a user visits the site, goes to contact form which checks if there are any error messages from that user trying to submit the form with say missing fields  and they see the mailchimp message showing another persons email address. p  pHeres the relevant code.p  papp.jsp  precodevar express  requireexpress, flash  requireconnectflash  ...  app.useflash  ...  app.usefunctionreq, res, next    var msgs   msgs  req.session.messages  []   res.locals.messages  msgs   res.locals.hasMessages  msgs.length   req.session.messages  []   return next   ...  app.getcontact, express.csrf, routes.main.contact app.postcontact, express.csrf, routes.main.submit codepre  pcontact form controllerp  precodeexports.contact  functionreq, res      res.locals.token  req.session.csrf     res.rendermaincontact   exports.submit  functionreq, res     var send  functionmessage, fn      var sendgrid  new SendGridsettings.sendgridusername, settings.sendgridpassword     sendgrid.send       to settings.contactemail,       from message.email,       subject Contact Message,       text message.message     , fn       var validate  functionmessage      var v  new Validator,       errors  []             v.error  functionmsg        errors.pushmsg           v.checkmessage.name, Please enter your name.len1, 100     v.checkmessage.email, Please enter a valid email address.isEmail     v.checkmessage.message, Please enter a valid message.len1, 1000      return errors       function render      res.locals.token  req.session.csrf     res.rendermaincontact, locals       var message  req.body.message,     errors  validatemessage,     locals           if errors.length  0      sendmessage, functionsuccess        if success          locals.error  Error sending message         locals.message  message        else          locals.notice  Your message has been sent.              render         else      locals.error  Your message has errors     locals.errors  errors     locals.message  message     render     codepre  pcontact formp  precode if error or notice  ltdiv idmessage classalert alert if error error else success endif  gt   ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissalertgtltbuttongt   lth4gt if error  error  else  notice  endif lth4gt    if errors    ltulgt    for e in errors      ltligt e ltligt    endfor    ltulgt    endif  ltdivgt  endif   ltform methodpostgt ... codepre  porder form controller called by payment gateway api on successful order  never called directly by userp  precodevar joinNewsletter  functiondata     try        var api  new MailChimpAPIsettings.mailchimpapi,  version  1.3, secure  false        api.listSubscribe         id settings.mailchimplistid,         emailaddress data.email,         mergevars            fname data.first,           lname data.last         ,         doubleoptin data.optin  false       , function     catch error        console.logerror.message      ...  joinNewsletter     email order.email,     first order.fname,     last order.lname    codepre

Negative 873 pI have a Django app with a MySQL database which allows answering of questions on an HTML page. The answers get sent to the server via AJAX calls. These calls are initiated by various JavaScript events and can often be fired multiple times for one answer. When this happens, multiple save requests for one answer get sent to the server.p  pIn order to avoid duplicate answers, each answer has a clientside ID generated the first time it gets saved  codeclientidcode. Before creating a new answer serverside, the Django app first checks the DB to see if an answer with such a codeclientidcode exists. If one does, the second save requests updates the answer instead of creating a new one.p  pIn Chrome, when a text input field is focused, and the user clicks outside of the Chrome window, two save requests get fired one after the other. The server receives them both. Lets say that for the sake of the example the codeclientidcode is 71.p  pThe first request checks the DB and sees that no answers with a codeclientidcode 71 exist. It creates a new answer and saves in the the DB. I am debugging with breakpoints and at this time, I see in my external MySQL database viewer that indeed the answer is saved. In my IDE, when I execute codeAnswer.objects.filterclientid71code I get the answer as well. I let the debugger continue.p  pImmediately my second breakpoint fires for the second AJAX save answer request. Now a curious thing happens. In my IDE, when I execute codeAnswer.objects.filterclientid71code I see no answers My external tool confirms that the answer is there. So my code creates a new answer and saves it. Now if in my IDE I execute codeAnswer.objects.filterclientid71code I see two answers with that codeclientidcode. p  pI am guessing that the DB connection or MySQL uses some kind of timebased method of keeping views constant, but it is causing me problems here. I would like a live insight into the state of the DB.p  pI am not using any transaction management, so Django should be doing autocommit.p  pHow can I instruct the DB connect to refresh or reset itself to take into consideration data which is actually in the DB p

Negative 873 pI have an ADO.Net Data Access layer in my application that uses basic ADO.Net coupled with CRUD stored procedures one per operation e.g. SelectmyTable, InsertmyTable. As you can imagine, in a large system like ours, the number of DB objects required by the DA layer is pretty large.p  pIve been looking at the possibility of refactoring the layer classes into EF POCO classes. Ive managed to do this, but when I try to performance test, it gets pretty horrific. Using the class below create object, set Key to desired value, call dataselect, 100000 runs of data loading only takes about 47 seconds there are only a handful of records in the DB. Whereas the Stored Proc method takes about 7 seconds.p  pIm looking for advice on how to optimise this  as a point of note, I cannot change the exposed functionality of the layer  only how it implements the methods i.e. I cant pass responsibility for context ownership to the BO layerp  pThanksp  precodepublic class DAContext  DbContext      public DAContextDbConnection connection, DbTransaction trans          baseconnection, false              this.Database.UseTransactiontrans            protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              base.OnModelCreatingmodelBuilder          Stop Pluralising the Object names for table names.         modelBuilder.Conventions.RemoveltPluralizingTableNameConventiongt          Set any property ending in Key as a key type.         modelBuilder.Properties.Whereprop gt prop.Name.ToLower.EndsWithkey.Configureconfig gt config.IsKey            public DbSetltMyTablegt MyTable get set    public class MyTable  DataAccessBase       region Properties      public int MyTableKey  get set       public string Name  get set      public string Description  get set      public bool Active  get set      public int CreatedBy  get set      public DateTime CreatedDate  get set      public int ModifiedBy  get set      public DateTime ModifiedDate  get set       endregion      region constructors      public MyTable              Set Default Values.

Negative 873 pUsing Backgrid to show tables with two backbone Collections CollectionA and CollectionB which could contain large data maybe several thousand models.  Now that Ive got Backgrid handling the two collections nicely, I need to add a checkbox that will cause a filter to be applied to the Collection.  The filter involves some calculating its not just like color  red.p  pI could create a second, filtered copy of each Collection backgrid displays a collection, but Id rather not have to add listeners to handle new data that comes in from time to time.  Also, memory, copy time etc because the filtered version isnt necessarily small.  p  pQt has a thing called a ProxyModel which in my case would look like a Collection so Backgrid could connect to it but really goes between the Collection and Backgrid or any other View.

Negative 873 pConsider a web service that exposes a strongsearchstrong endpoint. Any operation on that endpoint would be a good candidate for the GET method as it would be idempotent. The complexity of the search parameters however may result in extremely long URLs that may not be handled properly despite the RFC not specifying a hard limit by the client, the proxies, or even the server.p  pSo the only alternative would be to use POST and pass the search criteria in the body of the request. It wouldnt be a big deal if it it wasnt for the fact that the response is now strongnot cacheablestrong it is not possible to define its cacheability on the basis of its URL, some of the headers Accept and the strongfull bodystrong where the actual search criteria are.p  pAm I right in thinking that HTTP1.1 is lacking in this respect and there is no elegant and simple solution to the problemp  pThanksp

Negative 873 pIm going to make some web applicatiob using RailsPostgreSQL, and I need your advice about a piece of database structure. There are 2 tables shops and feebacks. Shops must store some basic info name, address, etc. Feedbacks must store info about feedback description, users rating for store.  The web app must show shops and their average ratings. I can store all info about ratings in feedbacks table and calculate average values using SQL functions get all feedbacks by shopid, sum it and divide to number of feedbacks. But may be it is good to have 2 additional fields rating, countoffeedbacks in shops table in order to do it faster Please, give me advice. p

Negative 873 pIm am trying to find a method of adding a specific number of working days to a date in Business Objects  either a universe object or report object is acceptable. This is not a case of calculating business days between 2 dates but taking a start date and adding X working days to get a result date, taking into account weekends and bank holidays we have a calendar table which flags working days but notably does not have a countable ID field. Essentially i need a direct copy of the NETWORKDAYS function in Excel. p  pAgain I stress this is about adding working days to a start date, not calculating between 2 days, for which there are a number of solutions already available. If anyone has some suggestions or can point to a solution id be most gratefulp  pFor info we are using Business Objects XI 3.1 sp5 and our database is Oracle 9.p  pRegards,p  pChizo Ejindup

Negative 873 pIm new to JavaScript, and for school I have to automatically make every lth1 on my page generate into an ol with in every li a link to the place on my page where that header is placed so in the end I have a table of contents with links on every li. So I should be able to just write text and not worry about the table of contents.

Negative 873 pI have an application Im building that is basically just an online spreadsheet. Ive been wondering how I should start building this. My primary tech stack is with Rails, but I can change depending on the job, though Id prefer to keep at least the backend with Rails and then maybe a backbone frontendp  pThe application isnt exactly a spreadsheet though, instead of columns going by A,B,C like they do in Excel, users will be able to create names for columns. So for example they could create a column called strongRevenuestrong and have the rows 1,2,3 have values of em1000em, em2000em, and em3000em. Users will also be able to sort the columns ASC or DESC. p  pI thought about just having a Mysql table with say 30 fields where 15 are the values, and 15 are the corresponding column names. Except wont this be an incredibly inefficient method Not to mention there would have to be a hard limit on how many columns a user could put in. p  pSo is there a better method Or the method I just described the best way. p

Negative 873 pI have a dynamic web project that Ive created with Maven in Eclipse Kepler. I need to use an applet in my web application. But, deploying applet with web content in Eclipse is problem, actually Eclipse deploys applet files to webinf files but we can not access WebInf files directly in web application. For that reason, I exported that applet to my WebContent folder. If I dont use external classes in applet, there is no error. I mean, if I do not import any external classes, there will not be any problem.p  pBut I need to import some other java classes. When I export applet to jar, other java classes that applet needs are not exist in the jar. I figured out that if I export applet to runnable jar, other classes will be exist in jar package.p  pIn Eclipse, I can not export applet to runnable. There is configuration in run configuration, under Applet tab, I can run it in Eclipse. But when I export it to runnable jar, launch configuration is always blank. I deleted my configurations, everything is same.p  pHere is my configurations  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhJ4e9.png altLaunch Configuration in Export img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com326YQ.png altRun Configurationp

Negative 873 pHi in a practice paper for revision Ive been given this question.p  pThe class BinaryTree in Question 3 stores integers in a binary tree structure, and method isInOrder tests whether the top label of the tree is greater than the top label of the left subtree and smaller than the top label of the left subtree. A generic form of that class could store instances of any class that implements the Comparable interfacep  precodepublic interface ComparableltTgt      public int compareToT o  codepre  pWhere instance.compareToarg returns a negative value if instance is less than arg, 0 if instance and arg are equal, and a positive value if instance is greater than arg. For example, class Integer implements Comparable with instance.compareToarg returning instance  arg.p  pa Give a generic version of class BinaryTree that stores instances of a type parameter E, with the requirement that E extends Comparable. Note that you will need to change the code in the isInOrder method so that it uses compareTo. Do not include a main method in your answer.p  pThe code from the earlier question is here a hrefhttppastebin.comx2p7q3wy relnofollowhttppastebin.comx2p7q3wyap  pIm really having trouble wrapping my head around what I have to do for the question and most of the information I have been able to find on generics has just confused me. If anyone could help me with this question or give me a good introduction to generic classes I would be very thankful.p
Negative 873 pI am developing an ASP.NET MVC 5 application and I need to manage some global parameters, which are basically just a set of keyvaluepairs. My requirements are the followingp  ol liInitial values are read from a server config file.li liParameters are available in every controller for both readingwriting and addingdeleting like a new parameter can be added if certain controller is executed.li liParameters should surface subsequent request either residing in codeSessioncode or serialized in codeQueryStringcode.li liI should be possible to see and easily manage them CRUD using a special admin webpage.li ol  pMy brute force approach for this would be just to implement a static class with codeListltTupleltstring,stringgtgtcode to keep the settings, use codeSystem.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManagercode to populate initial values, use static properties to store and retrieve the list in a session variable and design a separate controller and view for managing the settings.p  pBut this looks like reinventing the wheel to me. Is there any not necessarily fullfledged preexisting solution in ASP.NET, or as a NuGet package I might rest my efforts upon Or maybe I am missing something fundamental in ASP.NETp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Depending on the nature of the parameter, some of them might have the lifetime of the codeApplicationcode, whereas some of them are bound to the current user session. Therefore they need to be either preserved in a codeSessioncode object or passed through in every request.p

Negative 873 pIve launched a CentOS 6.4 AMI and configured it to act as a base instance for our application. Im now trying to create an AMI from this which can be brought up as required. p  pUnfortunately when a new instance is created from the AMI the root users key pair remains that which was assigned to the original template instance when it was created from a CentOS AMI. I was hoping that AWS would be able to assign a new key pair to each instance of the AMI as its created. Although we wont be using the root key pair for daytoday work on the instances, Id prefer they didnt all share the same key.p  pDespite creating a new key pair at launch time Im only able to log in using the original key.

Negative 873 pIm struggling with a retaining issue between two of my UIViewControllers. The view controllers are never deleted causing my app memory to keep growing memory consumption.p  pUITitleScreenViewController is my initial view controller. When I go from it to UIChooseAntViewController a choose player screen I want to relinquish ownership of UITitleViewController but as you can see in the instruments below the controller is still retained after the transitionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY9Ber.png altsnapshot 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQISQZ.png altsnapshot 2p  pThe second image is the retainrelease history. All entries prior to 133 were issued on the app startup. I believe 133 and 140 are pairs created by the storyboard segue. So whose responsibility is to issue that extra release to destroy the controller I tried to set self.view  nil on my willDidDisappear method but no deal.  p  pNot only it is not releasing the controllers but it is creating new instances of them each time a transition. For instance, when I come back from ChooseAnt to Title it creates another instance of UITitleViewControllerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comy9DKl.png altsnapshot 3p  pThings that are important to sayp  p1 NSZombies flag is not ticked in the target scheme 2 There are no blocks in my UITitleViewController, and I commented out all blocks in UIChooseAntController. In fact these controllers are very simple. UITitle is entirely defined via storyboard just a view with a background and two buttons performing seguesp  pwhile UIChooseAnt is a control that presents a background and a swipe interface to display available characters and radio buttons. The segue is performed programatically by calling [self performSegueWithIdentifier]p  p3 I dont know if this matters but the segues are defined as modal and have no animation. p  pEDIT 4 None of the the controllers reference each other.  p  pBelow is the source code for the TitleViewControllerp  pThis problem is driving me crazy. If anyone could shed some light on it.

I am relatively new to javascript so some of the syntax may be wrong.p  pI am dynamically creating an HTML list of distinct values for every column in a table then putting them in a menu that opens when you click the header of the column functions like a table in Excel.

The part that takes long is the .append function call. This goes very fast in Firefox, but in IE 10 it takes about 1.5 seconds when I am working with about 2200 items in the items array. Since a couple of columns have this many items and I have 12 columns, this takes a long time. I have tried individually appending each list element though I figured that wouldnt work and I have tried setting the innerHTML instead of .append but none of it works.p  pIs there some sort of bug in the IE engine for this kind of thing and, if so, is there a workaround for this situation Or is there just a more efficient way to do thisp  pThanks, in advance.p

Negative 873 pI am using Play framework 2.1 which uses logback. However, I have my own native library which can bind to slf4j. Since slf4j can bind to single binding which appears higher in the class path, it is picking up logback rather than mine which is lower in the class path.p  pHow can I configure play class path so that my library is higher in the class path than logbackp
Negative 873 pHey guys one of the aspects of a program of mine opens .txt files via the OpenDialog javax command.  My bufferedreader works fine in my developing environment but when I try to export the project to a .jar my program doesnt seem to load in the data.  I can still access the openDialog subview, pick the file, etc. but the file wont load and Im not sure how to debug a jar so Im unsure on whether the error is a bufferedreader or from the dialog itself.  Like I said the program works fine when I compile and run BLueJ but for some reason when I create the .jar it stops after opendialog.  Anyone familiar with this type of errorp  pFor explanation, the method adds a deck of cards from a text file already shuffled.

I have tried both GridInlineEditing and GridRowEditing, but each are causing issues.p  pI need to calculate values based on the value of a cell. So lets say I update cell A, then cell B should update to reflect this value. Similarly for editing cell B, then cell A should update.  As well as this, I need to validate my changes before submitting.p  pGridInlineEditing  CompleteEditEvent fires each time tab is pressed and I can work out which values have changed based on storing previous value and lookng at Store.Record.getChange, so this works.

The conflict occurred in database testdb, table dbo.Product, column ProductID. codepre  pWhats happening is when my application triggers the update stored procedure, it deletes all images from the ProductImage table based on the ProductID, and then adds them back in depending on what images the user selects.p  pSo first, it updates the main tablep  precodeUPDATE Product SET.... etc. codepre  pThen it deletes all images associated with that productp  precodeDELETE FROM ProductImage WHERE ProductID  ProductID codepre  pThen, it adds them back in based on the delimited string... image1.jpgimage2.jpgimage3.jpgp  precodeWHILE LENImages gt 0 BEGIN     INSERT INTO ProductImage  ProductID, ImageFile  VALUES  ProductID, LEFTImages, CHARINDEX, Images 1          SET Images  STUFFImages, 1, CHARINDEX, Images,  END codepre  pThis does not work when I have the FK setup on the tables... However, Im able to open a new query window in SSMS and do a delete from the ProductImage table and an insert right back into it with an existing productID from the Product table.p  pMaybe Im missing something silly. I hope so.p  pThank youp  p EDIT p  pAdding more clarity of steps...p  pAfter creating the two tables and inserting data into the product table.p  pI right click over the ProductImage table, and select Design. I right click over the design area and select Relationships. I click Add and then expand tables and columns, and click the little ... button to use the interface to do it. For the primary key table, I find the Product table and select ProductID for the Column. The foreign key table I select ProductID from the ProductImage table... then I saved the table.p  pSo when a product is edited through the application, it uses a stored procedure to update the data. p  pWhen it gets to the images, it attempts to delete all images from ProductImage table that are associated with the ProductID.

Negative 873 pstrongWhere did the questionstrongp  pWe are using RabbitMQ as task queue. One of specific tasks  sending notices to Vkontakte social network. They api has limit to request per seconds and this limit based on your application size. Just 3 calls for app with less then 100k people and so on. So we need to artificially limit out request to they service. Now this logic is application based. It simple while you can use just one worker per such queue, just set something like sleep300ms and be calm. But when your should use N workers this synchronization becomes not trivial.p  pstrongHow to limit throughput with RabbitMQstrongp  pBased on story above. If it were possible set prefetch size not only message based but time based to this logic can be much simple.

Negative 873 pIve been working with strongCQ5.6strong for about a month now and our test site is almost done in terms of components. p  pHowever when we try to validate the pages we run into problems because AEM puts codeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgtcode above all our pages. p  pNow, I cant find any place where the Doctype is explicitly declared in our code. Nor is the HTML tag in our code, so i presume AEM wraps these around everything.p  pFirst I tried deleting the import of the doctype in our page component and replacing it with codeltDOCTYPE htmlgtcode but then we ended up with 2 doctype declarations. First the XHTML one, then a wrapped codelthtmlgtcode tag and then my HTML5 one.p  pIve read in the docs that you can set the doctype using the cqdoctype property, but no clue where I should add that property to.p  pI also tried putting this above the head tags in our page components, but to no availp  precodelt Doctype doc Doctype.valueOfHTML5    doc.toRequestrequest gt  lt Doctype.fromRequestrequest.getDeclaration gt  codepre  pCould anyone explain to me how or where I could strongset the doctypestrong to HTML5 for our projectp

Negative 873 pI am trying to find a simple solution to a required input type of scenario. I have multiple small forms that all send on one button save on the bottom of the page. What I am trying to accomplish is something like ngRequired, however across the whole controller, not just the individual forms. So the desired effect is pretty simple  if any of the inputs arent filled out  set a boolean or something to false that disables the save button at the bottom.p  pSo my first attempt is like this  p  pI have a model on each of the required items  there are 10 itemsp  pthen I have a function that checks when you try to click the button how many are chcked like this p  precodeifscope.modeltracker1     if there is anything inside model 1 add 1 to the tracker     scope.modeltracker  1  codepre  pand if the counter is not 10, dont do anything all required are not filled outp  precodeifscope.modeltracker  10     do nothing because all required are not filed out else     run save, all required all filed out   codepre  pSo   I feel like there should be a much easier solution than my first attempt here. Maybe something along the lines of checking if any individual one of these required fields is false, dont fire I know that ngRequied would be great for this, but unfortunately the way this has to be structured, it cannot be one large form. There has to be a much easier way to accomplish this task with angular. p  pAny input would be much appreciated, thanks for readingp

Negative 873 pIm creating a program which extracts a docx file, displays it in a Javafx graphic interface with buttons in place of flags put in the docx, and when one puts on it, it modifies the docx taken in input.  Im using the docx4j API for extracting and modifying the document. The problem is that the program fails if i take in entry a docx generated from Microsoft Word. Im forced to use an artifice.p  pIm taking my docx made on Word, then i load it in Google Docs and I use the Download in .docx format option. If i directly put the docx from Word in my program, it fails.p  pI noticed my Word file was two times lighter after being passed trough google doc. Same, if I tale a docx file downloaded from Google Docs, if i open it in Word and modify one letter and save it, he becomes two times heavier. For the record i use word 2008.p  pThats it, so Id like to know if someone know what explains this difference.p  pThanksp

Negative 873 pedit im using jdeveloper 11.1.2.4 and deploying on weblogic 10.3.6 having the patches for jsf2.0 applied.p  pI ran into this issue when Im using cascading depending autosuggest behaviour in a jsf page. It seems that the suggestion popup remembers caches previous selections based on the string used to  obtain initial value. This suggestion text then appears to all the other fields as well, it doesnt even invoke the methods to recalculate said suggestions.p  pIve made a simple example to showcase this error as I cannot post code from my project.p  pUse case I have 3 input text  country, county, cityp  pUser writes something in the country field, he gets suggestions based on a query countryname startWith searchStringp  pUser writes something in county field, gets suggestions based on query countyName startWith searchString AND countryIdthe previous countryIdp  pUser writes something in city field, gets suggestions based on query cityName startWith searchString AND countythe previous countyIdp  pIt all works great, unless the start of the search string for any fields is the same as the one used for the other fields. p  pExample I write R in countries, I then select a country starting with R. I then move to the county field and again write R because I know I have a county starting with that letter or more in the database. What happens is that the popup for the autosuggest shows the same result it showed for the countries field. It doesnt even recalculate the value does not enter the method in the bean.p  pIn order for me to be able to select the proper county I have to use more than 1 letter such as Ra. Then it works, but the problem persists if my initial string for countries was also Ra.p  pThis is the code in the viewObjectImpl classes, used to get the data which will populate the autosuggest for each field they are all exposed as client interface methods from their corresponding viewObjectsp  precodepublic List FindCountryString countryName        ListltCountryRowImplgt result  new ArrayListltCountryRowImplgt       this.setBindCountryNamecountryName       this.setApplyViewCriteriaNameCountryViewCriteria       this.executeQuery       RowSetIterator rsIterator  this.createRowSetIteratornull       rsIterator.reset       while rsIterator.hasNext            CountryRowImpl row  CountryRowImplrsIterator.next           result.addrow              rsIterator.closeRowSetIterator       return result       public List FindCountyInteger countryId, String countyName        ListltCountyRowImplgt result  new ArrayListltCountyRowImplgt       this.setBindCountryIdcountryId       this.setBindCountyNamecountyName       this.setApplyViewCriteriaNameCountyViewCriteria       this.executeQuery       RowSetIterator rsIterator  this.createRowSetIteratornull       rsIterator.reset       while rsIterator.hasNext            CountyRowImpl row  CountyRowImplrsIterator.next           result.addrow              rsIterator.closeRowSetIterator       return result       public List FindCityInteger countyId, String cityName        ListltCityRowImplgt result  new ArrayListltCityRowImplgt       this.setBindCountyIdcountyId       this.setBindCityNamecityName       this.setApplyViewCriteriaNameCityViewCriteria       this.executeQuery       RowSetIterator rsIterator  this.createRowSetIteratornull       rsIterator.reset       while rsIterator.hasNext            CityRowImpl row  CityRowImplrsIterator.next           result.addrow              rsIterator.closeRowSetIterator       return result    codepre  pBelow  is my code in the backing bean which doesnt always get executed.

I have looked at above 10 frameworks and I still couldnt match all my criteriap  ol liMature project with community supportli liDefinition of mappings by annotations or XMLli liBidirectional mappingli liPossibility of tuning generated mapping codeli liPossibility of creating mappings basing on comprehensive conditions wildcards, regexps, logical conditionsli ol  pMy current candidates are Dozer annotations, mature project, MapStruct generated code, possibility of building comprehensive conditions, Moo annotations, friendly SQLlike syntax or doing it manually  unfortunately none of these matching all criteriap  pCould you share with me your experience in this subject Maybe you met with similar problem and have better approach.p  pThank you.p

Negative 873 pI have one question regarding transaction isolation level and locking in mysql.p  pI have one query keeps getting the lock timeout errorp  precodejava.sql.SQLException Lock wait timeout exceeded try restarting transaction codepre  pThe queries basically try to delete records with a specific dateid. BTW, the dateid is indexed as well. But most of the times, there are no records match, i.e. it will delete nothing.p  pAfter some investigation, I found it may be caused by a culprit longrunning query, which do a range select on the same table. However, what confused me is both transaction run at isolation level of READ COMMITTED. So I have no clue why a lock is needed and why it could timeout especially consider there is no matching record to deletep  pThank you in advancep
Negative 873 pIve been playing with a generic usb camera to take snapshots every few seconds. With the help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14298250vbnetandwebcamselectvideosourcedialogthis SO questiona, I was able to get the camera working however, when you click the button to connect to the camera, a dialog box appears.p  pThe difference between the other question and my question is that I have two video sources a built in webcam and a usb camera. I also intend to have multiple cameras connected, all taking pictures. It appears that when you have multiple devices, you always get the dialog box where you have to choose the device. Im trying to automatically choose the camera and eventually cameras, plural without this dialog box.p  pThere are other pieces of sample code that I have played with  samples that have a device listbox that is populated I thought this was what I needed and Id just remove the listbox control and process the list and what to connect to in code, but every one of these samples populates the listbox with Microsoft WDM Image Capture Win32 instead of the devices listed in the dialog after attempting to connect to this device.p  pSurely theres a way to automate the webcams Im connecting to instead of having to choose it from a dropdown in a Windows dialog, right How would I go about doing thisp

So the solution that works for one case doesnt for the other.. p  pMy current and extremely verbose solution see below works, but its ugly, long, and annoying to maintain to add or remove an additional file. strongIs there way I can optimise this method, possibly with new voodoo from NIO package for instance by just loop over the files in the coderescode folder and just copy them all to the new location.strong Im not sure how to avoid specifying the filenames and paths for codegetResourcecode would work in that scenario.p  precodeprivate void loadRes throws IOException      get styling resources from the jar file      File htmlRes  new Filetopfolder, res     ifhtmlRes.exists  htmlRes.isDirectory             htmlRes.mkdir      File cssfile  new FilehtmlRes, style.css,          bulletfile  new FilehtmlRes,i.gif,           bannerfile  new FilehtmlRes, banner.png,          bgfile  new FilehtmlRes,bodybg.png,          imgbg  new FilehtmlRes,buttonbg.png,          hovbg  new FilehtmlRes,buttonhoverbg.png,          visuimg  new FilehtmlRes,visu.png,          pcimg  new FilehtmlRes,pc.png,          ascgif  new FilehtmlRes,asc.gif,          descgif  new FilehtmlRes,desc.gif,          bggif  new FilehtmlRes,bg.gif      URL cssurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresstyle.css     URL bulleturl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresi.gif     URL bannerurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresbanner.png     URL bgurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresbodybg.png     URL image1url  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresbuttonbg.png     URL image2url  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresbuttonhoverbg.png     URL visuurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresvisu.png     URL pcurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourcerespc.png     URL ascurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresasc.gif     URL descurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresdesc.gif     URL bggifurl  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresbg.gif      FileOutputStream fos  new FileOutputStreamcssfile     Resources.copycssurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreambulletfile     Resources.copybulleturl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreambannerfile     Resources.copybannerurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreambgfile     Resources.copybgurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreamimgbg     Resources.copyimage1url, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreamhovbg     Resources.copyimage2url, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreamvisuimg     Resources.copyvisuurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreampcimg     Resources.copypcurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreamascgif     Resources.copyascurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreamdescgif     Resources.copydescurl, fos     fos  new FileOutputStreambggif     Resources.copybggifurl, fos       scripts and finish head     URL sortscript  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresscripts.js     URL funcscript  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresjquery.tablesorter.min.js     URL scinotparser  ExportUtils.class.getResourceresjquery.tablesorter.scinot.js      File divjs  new FilehtmlRes,scripts.js     File jquerysorttable  new FilehtmlRes,jquery.tablesorter.min.js     File jquerystscinot  new FilehtmlRes, jquery.tablesorter.scinot.js      fos  new FileOutputStreamdivjs     Resources.copysortscript, fos      fos  new FileOutputStreamjquerysorttable     Resources.copyfuncscript, fos      fos  new FileOutputStreamjquerystscinot     Resources.copyscinotparser, fos   codepre

Negative 873 pWhen you create a viewbased table view in Xcodes interface builder, it automatically adds an codeNSTableCellViewcode control, inside of which is an codeNSTextFieldcode control. You better add constraints to your text field control, otherwise it wont resize properly when you resize a column.p  pBut it turns out that codeNSTableCellViewcode controls are unnecessary. You can just use a codeNSTextFieldcode control, or any view that you like, in its place. And you wont need to add constraints the control will resize automatically. So what it is the point of using an codeNSTableCellViewcode controlp

Negative 873 pI have successfully implemented MvxAutoCompleteTextView that is configured on an MvxItemTemplate.  I had to extend the DataModel object in order to get it to work.  Another requirement was that the autocomplete might not be the only item in the textview, so I coded it to only look a the last word when considering matches and replaced the last word once the selection was made.  The problem is that every time I pick something from the list, the cursor starts back at the beginning of the line.

That would allow the currently installed task server to finish running its tasks while the new server starts excepting new one.p  pMy question is is there something built into the deb system that I can take advantage of, or do I need to do this using pre and post install scripts If I need to use a scripts, how would I ensure that the package is installed into a properly versioned directory e.g. taskserver1.2p
Negative 873 pI have a weird system and I wondered how Id lay it out in a class diagram, this is an system for a small college projectp  pFor simplicity, I have two halves of my system, a Members side and a Race side, the members side is used by Member Secretaries, and the Race side is used by Race Secretaries, the chairman of the company can access the whole system whereas each Secretary only has one respective half of the system they access via a GUI.p  ul lipThere is a BaseRace class which stores all race information, but not the functions that modify this information.pli lipThere is also an Organiser, which extends the functionality of Race Secretary, but has limited functionality not as much methods accessible to thempli lipThere is also a BaseMember class and this has three subclasses which hold member information, these are members and they have a lower permissions level than Secretaries Junior,Senior,Supportpli ul  pThe way I set out the separate Race and Member interaction strongmethodsstrong was, I made a RaceFunctions class and a MemberFunctions class which store both the member functions add, remove, edit and the race functions add, remove, edit.p  pThis way, the chairman can access both classes, and the Secretaries only access one.p  ul liIs this correctli liIf so, how would I lay these out in a class diagramli ul  pPlease keep in mind I have no code yet and this is my initial class diagram.p

Negative 873 pright now I want to implement a border on hover on a button.p  pThat button is in a div together with 3 other buttons. However, as soon as I hover over it, the border is being displayed, but at the same time the button expands the size of the added border as well, which is not what I have in my mind.p  pI made a fiddle to demonstrate the problem a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netL9dfg74f3Click meap  pI read up about this topic here, and I indeed found a solution, by adding codemargintop 3pxcode to the hover classes, however, that squeezes the button, which is not what I want.p  pInstead, I want the button to not look compressed or anything, but rather simply with a 4px border overlaying the top 4 px of the button.p  pAny advicep  pThanks in advancep

If they have, then I show the Test Fragment, otherwise I show the Login Fragment.p  pSo when the user first logs in, I use the interface callback to notify the Activity that the user has logged in and show the TestFragment. Also, if the user goes away from the app and then returns, I check in the onCreate method if the user is logged in by checking the access token.p  pWhen the user first logs in, it works as desired. But the problem Im facing is that if I kill the app or remove it from the Recents list, I lose the access token. AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken always returns null. Is this not the right way to handle it p

Negative 873 pIm writing a very simple pipeline for processing uploaded files and Ive opted to keep the state of the pipeline on the file system instead of a database. The pipeline itself is very simple because files are processed in temporary locations and then atomically moved into a folder that indicates a specific stage of the pipeline is complete. Once the file is moved into a folder for the next stage the file from the previous stage is deleted. The pipeline is a single process and there is only one of it active at a time so there are no race conditions or crash scenarios to worry about. At worst we repeat work that was done previously and waste some disk space.p  pThe problems are with the very first step of the pipeline. The server that is handling the file uploads moves files into a specific folder to make it available for clients to access and at the same time it creates a symlink in another folder to indicate to the pipeline process that there is work to be done. Since there is a race condition here Im using file locks to create and delete the symlinks. The pipeline process locks the symlink, processes the file, deletes the symlink, and releases the lock. The upload process does the same thing except it does it for creating the symlink. This takes care of the race condition between deleting the symlink and creating it but there is still a bug here.p  pIt is possible that the upload process will crash after moving the file into place but before creating the symlink to indicate there is a file that needs to be processed. I would like to know what is the best way to handle this case. I can in theory create a file at the beginning of the upload process and then delete it upon successful creation of the symlink to indicate successful creation of the symlink but this again leads to the same locking problems as before because there are multiple upload processes that need to coordinate between each other.p  pIs there a simpler way to handle the case of the crashed upload processp

Negative 873 pPreviously, I tried NVML by using the function nvmlDeviceGetUtilizationRates. I test it by this way, while the collection is running, I excute a DFT  the Kernel is organised as lt7,32 on Tesla C2070 which have 14 SMs, on my thought, there were 7 blocks excuted on GPU at the same time, and the utilization should be 50, but the API gave the result as 99, which means GPU be used completely.  Then, I read the documents of NVML, the nvmlDeviceGetUtilizationRates can only return the pecent of time that over the past sample period during which one or more kernels was executing on the GPU. How can I get the active SM numbers while some kernel is running on GPUp

Negative 873 pI am trying to follow DDD for my current project. My question is specifically regarding POST request that contains values for my domain model.

I first map Person to PersonEF using AutoMapper which sets the Id to 0 in PersonEF and hence the INSERT in database fails. So to fix these my options arep  ol lipName Id as something else in Person. If I do this then I would have to write custom mapping just for Id for GET requests.pli lipMake Id nullable int in both Person and PersonEF and this way auto increment will work, but having key as nullable int doesnt sound like a good idea in itself.pli ol  pSo please suggest the best way to do this. p  pEDITp  pMy bad.

When the user inputs, say B, I want to now perform operations on Object2. p  pHere is essentially what I have.p  precodestring getOption      string option      cout ltlt Option Menu ltlt endl     cout ltlt A  Option 1 ltlt endl     Object1     cout ltlt B  Option 2 ltlt Lendl    Object2     cout ltlt C  Option 3 ltlt endl     Object3      cin gtgt option      return option codepre  pNow that I have the input, I want to perform numerous options on the object. Something likep  precodevoid modifyFooStringfoo userSelectedObject       Local variables     string userInput       userInput  readInput  Function that reads valid input      userSelectedObject.setMethoduserInput  codepre  pBut with numerous functions. Its in a while loop, so I need to modify the object and then reprompt the user if they want to make changes to a different object.p  pWhen I look at this problem, I think a pointer can be used. For examplep  precodevoid getOptionFoo ampchoice      string option      cout ltlt Option Menu ltlt endl     cout ltlt A  Option 1 ltlt endl     Object1     cout ltlt B  Option 2 ltlt Lendl    Object2     cout ltlt C  Option 3 ltlt endl     Object3      cin gtgt option      if option  A         choice  ampObject1      else if option  A         choice  ampObject2      if option  A         choice  ampObject3  codepre  pSo ideally, I can use the pointer now in the functions proceeding the codegetOptioncode function to modify the selected object. However, when I try to implement it like this, its just not working. p  pHow do I return a pointer that can be used to modify a selected objectp  pThanksp

Negative 873 pIf the Attendee accepts or declines an appointmentmeeting request choosing the Respond with Comments option, then is there a way to capture these comments via EWS java api  Could not find any other API which might help except Searching the inbox of the Sender for AcceptedDeclined comments based on the Subject or Body of the sent item. But even this approach does not work as it would rely that the SubjectBody to be unique. However in outlook I do see that the meeting responses are grouped together along with original sent item.

Negative 873 pI wish to find a better way of handling responses than the method I was taught by the company that I worked for.p  pI was taught to use a generic HttpClient, that used volley to send the requests. The client had a static method that would be given a generic listener, ResponseListener, which would make the callback to the context when a volley response came through. The ResponseListener would keep track of all the request types . That is the code given to the client so that the context can differentiate between requests.p  pIs there any other way of keeping track of all the request codes without having to keep one big directory type interface file It becomes quite overwhelming to look at when you get past 100 requests.

Negative 873 pHow would you solve thisp  blockquote   pYou have 2 arrays, each with n numbers, n lt 500.  You can choose one number from   the first three in first array and multiple it with first number in   second array. Continue doing this until every number is used.

Best option is to choose 2. Sum is now 3  2  6br    For second number from second array  8  you can choose from 16,6,10 number 2 is   already used. Best option is to choose 6. Add 8  6 to sum, so sum is   now 54.br   For third number from second array  12 you can choose from   16,10 number 2 and 6 are already used. Best option is to choose 16.   Add 12  16 to sum, so sum is now 246.br   For last number from second   array  9  you can choose only 10.Add 9  10 to sum, so sum is now   336.p blockquote  pI had few ideas, but every one of them was wrong. For example I tried to sort both arrays and then biggest number in second array multiply with biggest possible number in  first array because 1. number in second array can choose only from 1.3. position in first array, second number can choose only from 1.4. etc., but this isnt right. Also I have some more solutions, but too hard for me to explain them, because I dont know how to express it in EnglishBut I could post a code and try to explain it , and they also arent right.br EDIT I have found some algorithms that may be solution for my problem.

Negative 873 pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netPointy2xr0chrp8 relnofollowHere is a JSFiddle that demonstrates what I describe belowap  pIve been trying to track down a weird Edge rendering issue. I have not been able to reproduce the problem, but I have been able to reproduce some odd behavior that I think is directly related. Ive got a background trick I use on some full pages and some page headers that involves creating a bunch of random codeltdivgtcode elements with very low opacity that is, almost transparent and then randomly transforming them around. Its sortof dumb but its been working for me without any issue in Firefox and Chrome for a while.p  pI recently started testing in Edge general testing nothing specific about the background, which I dont spend any time thinking about normally, and very soon noticed that, randomly, mousing over things with simple codehovercode style shifts like, darkening button background color would cause a nearlyopaque gray box to show up covering the element. The gray box would stick around for an unpredictable amount of time, and then go away randomly. It happened sometimes on just a few elements on the page, and sometimes not at all.p  pThat as you can imagine has been making me crazy, partly because I cannot reproduce it in a CodePen or JSFiddle. While trying to investigate, I started noticing that typing into an input field on one affected page the login page in fact was extremely sluggish. Im using a VirtualBox VM for this not a factor, I dont think, as a coworker with native Windows 10 sees exactly the same problems so I originally thought it was just latency through that, but after a while it became clear that it wasnt.p  pOn one of several attempts to randomly change something to see what was going on, I disabled the random codeltdivgtcode background, and both the gray box problem and the sluggish input problem went away.p  pThe fiddle linked above is a little simpler than the real setup, but not much. Its simple markupp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltinputgt     ltbrgt     ltbutton classtogglegtToggle Backgroundltbuttongt ltdivgt codepre  pand then some CSSp  precodebody      backgroundcolor blue     textalign center  .container      position relative     display inlineblock     margintop 100px  .shape      position absolute     backgroundcolor white  .noshapes .shape      display none  codepre  pThe JavaScript to make the shapes is also simplep  precodefor var i  0 i lt 2000 i      ltdivgt,          class shape,         css              transform translate  Math.random  1000  px,   Math.random  1000  px,             opacity Math.random  5  100,             height Math.random  200  px,             width Math.random  200  px              .prependTobody  codepre  pOn my real page, I only make about 100 random elements.p  pOn Firefox and Chrome, the input box is completely unaffected by the presence or absence of the background elements. However, in Edge, theres a distinct lag when typing into the input field when the elements are visible. Its as if the renderer is trying to do some sort of collision calculation as it updates the codeltinputgtcode display as the value changes.p  pI wish I could reproduce the even weirder gray box problem, but I havent been successful. Its clearly a rendering bug, much like many Ive seen over the years with predecessor IE in that the manifestation involves a lot of randomness, and seemingly uninteresting events like the window losing focus, or random mouse movements even trigger changes. Its a little odd that Edge would suffer from such an issue, but then maybe not. Does Edge still have the weird hasLayout thingp  pIll probably end up just sniffing for Edge which seems really sad because I cant think of any feature detect approach for the problem.p  pAnybody else seen this  I havent found mention of it so far.p  pemeditem I think I see the slow input issue in IE11, but I cannot reproduce the gray box problem there.p
