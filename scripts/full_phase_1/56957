Positive 56957 pI am using the Javascript SDK to log in to facebook and request publishactions permissions for my application.  I have everything working and can post photos to my application no problem.  I use my own dialog to let them set a comment and set privacy setting to Just Me, Friends or Public.p  pWhen a user first attempts to connect to facebook from my web app, they are asked to set the privacy setting level when posting photos Just Me, Friends, Public, etc.  The issue I am having is that I want to be able to get that information later when the user posts a photo through my app so I can see what privacy setting are available for my dialog.  For examplep  pA user logs in to my app and for publishactions chooses Friends as the privacy setting.  Later on if they are running my app, I give them a choice to pick Only Me, Friends or Public but I need to know that Public is not allowed for that user.  Currently if they choose public it will default back to Friends since that is what was picked when they connected through my app initially.p  pI have found examples of accessing the permissions in the privacysetting table using FQL but not for a particular app also that looks to be going away with versions after 2.0 according to a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencefqlprivacysetting relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencefqlprivacysettinga.p  pI have not been able to find an end point in the Graph Api to provide the apps privacy setting for a given app.p  pWould appreciate if anyone knows how to get this.p

Positive 56957 pI need to post messages on a Facebook page. Specifically I want to post via codecroncode.p  pHeres what the API docs sayp  blockquote   pPage Access Token  These access tokens are similar to user access tokens, except that they provide permission to APIs that read, write or modify the data belonging to a Facebook Page.

Positive 56957 pIm trying to create a Javascript application that has a filterable listing of certain kinds of public Facebook events. The thing is, the FB Graph API requires that you provide a User Access token in order to use the search for public events. I really dont want to make people log in to facebook in order to use the website, especially because ANY facebook users credentials are sufficient to query the events I want to query ie the search is independent of any user credentials, I just need them because the fb api requires me to have a user access token.p  pDo yall have any suggestions for a work around Im thinking about providing my own credentials securely, and just using them to make the actual queries. The thing is I would potentially need to be doing A LOT of queries per minute, so this might not be terribly realistic. Any suggestions would be helpful.p

I emdontem want to implement the whole workflow, the login dialog etc. and even if I did, the Facebook Web Sharing documentation doesnt seem to cover regular desktop apps so I wouldnt know how to.p  pIve already uploaded the image to cloud hosting and have a direct link. Lets assume there is a default browser properly configured in the operating system, and the user is logged into FB in that browser. Is it possible to trigger sharing the image by simply requesting a specific Facebook URL via this browserp  pIf not, what options do I havep
Positive 56957 pSo here is the challenge that I have.p  pI have a bunch of backend controllers which get the request and generate some responses. I know the frontend people can use those responses and generate the required social meta tags dynamically. For example they can produce the following snippet in their templates p  precode    ltmeta propertyogurl content gt     ltmeta propertyogdescription content gt     ltmeta propertyogimage content gt codepre  pBut my question is, is there anyway that I can send the social tags via URL.  In other words I dont want to have a template with some placeholders for social tags. I just want to generate them on the fly when a specific URL was requested and passing them via the URL.p  pSomething like a hrefhttpexample.comapiactionogimagesomeimage.png relnofollowhttpexample.comapiactionogimagesomeimage.pngap  pThank you.p

Negative 56957 pWhen your application takes a few  5 configuration parameters, and the application is going to be used by nontechnology users i.e. a hrefhttpen.wiktionary.orgwikiKISS relnofollowKISSa, how do you usually handle reading configuration options, and then passing around the parameters between objectsfunctions  multiple modulesp  pOptions examples input and output directoriesfile names, verbosity level.p  pI generally use codeoptparsecode Python and pass around the optionsparameters as  arguments but Im wondering if its more common to use a configuration text  file that is read directly by all modules objects but then, isnt this like having global variables, and without anyone owning the state.p  pAnother typical issue is unit testing if I want to unit test each single module independently, a particular module may only require 1 out of the 5 configuration options how do you usually decouple individual modulesobjects from the rest of the application, and yet still allow it to accept 1 or 2 required parameters does the unit test framework somehow invoke or take over the configuration functionalityp  pMy guess is that there is not a unique correct way to do this, but itd  be interesting to read about various approaches, or wellknown patterns.p

Negative 56957 pOK, so I am implementing an SVN repository to track development on a Dot Net project. I have defined the repository directory in accordance with the following structurep  precodeproject      trunk      branches         systest         production    tags         productionyyyymmdd codepre  pMain development is committed to the trunk of the project, and development is performed based on Change Requests CRs from the client. For the moment, I am happy to exclude the problem of overlapping CRs ie a file that is changed by more than on CR. My problem is how to manage the process of migrating only the file changes associated with a single CR from trunk to systest and from systest to production. The promotion process as I have it at the moment is take migrating from systest to prod as an example  p  ol liCreate a tag productionyyyymmdd based on the current production branch this is used to allow retrieving a particular version if you like  li liUpdate from production to a local Migration location eg CBuildProjectName  li liMerge bselectedb changes from systest to local Migration locationli liCommit changes back to production  li ol  pThe problem I have is with step 3. How do I tell SVN which files to merge to the Migration location. I do bnotb want to merge all changes from systest to prod and I might not even want to merge all changes in a particular revision from systest to prod, only changes in specific files.  p  pEdit I should also clarify that all the repository access is being done from a Windows client. Im not running commands on the SVN server. For interests sake, the SVN server is running on Linux, but that makes no difference to the problem space I believep  pCheersbr Richardp

Negative 56957 pIm trying to create a search engine for all literature books, articles, etc, music, and videos relating to a particular spiritual group.  When a keyword is entered, I want to display a link to all the PDF articles where the keyword appears, and also all the music files and video files which are tagged with the keyword in question. The user should be able to filter it with information such as authorartist, place, datetime, etc.  When the user clicks on one of the results links book names, for instance, they are taken to another page where snippets from that book everywhere the keyword is found are displayed.  p  pI thought of using the Lucene library or Searcharoo to implement my PDF search, but I also need a database to tag all the other information so that results can be filtered by authorartist information, etc.  So I was thinking of having tables for Text, Music, and Videos, and a field containing the path to the file for each.  When a keyword is entered, I need to search the DB for music and video files, and also need to search the PDFs, and when a filter is applied, the music and video search is easy, but limiting the text search based on the filters is getting confusing.p  pIs my approach correct  Are there better ways to do this Since the search content is limited only to the spiritual group, there is not an infinite number of items to search.

I tried using VisualVM to profile my Application but, although I can successfully connect to the Glassfish server as well as my context root, VisualVM doesnt seem to profile my own classes in the com.test. namespace. I see lots of Sun classes and other dependencies such as Lucene being accessed, but not a single instance of my own classes.p  pMy question is thus am I doing something wrong or is this a shortcoming of VisualVM and should I therefor try a different profiling toolp
Negative 56957 pI have a PHP site which as every other site has some hidden errors. The question is what should happen when an error occursp  pI see lots of PHP and other sites where in case of an error the page is a bit broken, sometimes even an internal error message is dumped to the page, but usually the site stays partly usable.p  pThe other approach which I follow is to terminate page rendering instantly and show an error message to the user.p  pWhich is the more user friendly approach in your opinion Let the application continue regardless of the error, so that some part of the page may still be rendered and usable Or terminate control flow immediately, because its worse to show a halfbaked page to the user and a proper error message should be shown insteadp  pUpdate its not about 404 pages, rather about those cases, when the page is found, but problems occur during generating it.p

Negative 56957 pI am building a web application that uses PHP 5, MySQL 5 and Javascript with jQuery and AJAX.p  pThe application is a quite complicated selection process with several pulldown menus that the user can select from in any order. Each select in a pulldown will give some more selection critera, that will limit the choices in the other pulldowns and finally give a limited result set.p  pI am using Javascript on the client side with AJAX connecting to PHP on the server and the MySQL database, the idea is that each time the user selects something from a pulldown I send a AJAX request to update all the other pulldowns. When all possible parameters have been set a result set will be presented.p  pI do want to keep the logic on the server side for various reasons, therefor using AJAX.p  pNow, I am not sure what is the best way to handle this iterative process for each userp  pI have a table with all the criteria that each selection result in. Since each pulldown selection will result in a set if selection criteria I could store a query string on the server that is being added to for each selection.  I then run the currently stored query string to find out what should go into each pulldown, send that data to the client, then store the query for later when more criteria will be added, run, send etc, etc... Then I have to store that query string on the server for each user, perhaps in a text file. Or perhaps as a stored procedure, see below....p  pAnother approach would be to just run the query with the new criteria when a selection is done, send the data to update the pulldowns, then store the selection in a temporary table that I run the next query on etc etc. So the temporary table will then shrink for each selection until I present the result.p  pThe app can have several users working at the same time, so must probably identify the users by cookiesession ID somehow....p  pAnd the stored query or temp table must die away after some time when each user leaves....howp  pSelection methods to add more and more criteria to select from a table, allowing for complicated calculations for selectionp  ul lipUsing joinpli lipUsing a temporary table that is being more and more limited as records are removed when new criteria are added.pli lipUsing subselections.pli ul  pStorage methods to keep on track between each step for each userp  ul lipStore parameters in a server file, and insert them into sql or stored procedure for each selection step, doing a new query on the whole database for each step, but each time with more criteria added.pli lipStore a sql query in a files, and extend it for each step....pli lipStore a sql query in a tablefield.....pli lipStore a sql query in a stored procedure .....pli lipStore the actual limited result set of previous selections for each user in a temopary table that will be smaller and smaller as more and more records are removed for each step.pli lipStore the parameters on the client side during the session, resending them all to the server for each selection pli ul  pCould anyone help with this decisionp  pRgds PMp

Negative 56957 pOur company started out with a single product, a rails app backed by some java services, then decided they wanted another product that was initially considerably different than the first, but as time has gone on weve realized they are starting to converge, and making a code change to one requires a similar code change to the other for a new featurebug fix.  This is obviously becoming a pain.  p  pIn some cases we have gems that share some of this functionality but it goes beyond ruby into javascript, css etc..p  pSo Im tasked with merging these two apps into one codebase.  I think eventually wed like it to be a single app with permission based role access but that will come much later.p  pMy first thought to quickly put them together is to create two rails engines and share common libs between them.  I think this is the quickest way to combine the code, find common sections and start sharing.p  pMy first problem though is how to route between the apps.  One app uses a single domain name that never changes, the other app has many domains.  Can someone suggest how I might route a particular request to a particular app so they can remain separate to start whilst sharing a common codebase of libsp  pOr, if anyone has other suggestions as to a way to combine these apps Im all ears.p  pTheyre both Rails 2.3.10 apps running JRUBY 1.5.3, but were open to possibly upgrading to Rails3 if that would make things significantly easier or cleaner ie with better Rack integration p  pI havent done any Rack programming but never hurts to learn if that will make our lives easier.p

Negative 56957 pIm doing some crazy multiple documents inside a single window stuff with the documentbased architecture and Im 95 done.p  pI have this twotier document architecture, where a parent document opens and configures the window, providing a list of child documents.  When the user selects one of the children, that document is opened with the same window controller and it places a codeNSTextViewcode in the window.  The window controllers document association is changed so that the edited dot and the window title track the currently selected document.

Negative 56957 pIm trying a little experiment at pushing a data set which is not geospatial but fits it quite well and am finding the results somewhat unsettling. The data set is genomic data e.g. the Human Genome where we have a region of DNA where elements like genes occupy specific start and stop coordinates our X axis. We have multiple regions of DNA chromosomes which  occupy the Y axis. The goal is to bring back all the items which intersect two X coordinates along a single Y coordinate e.g. LineStringSTART 1, END 2.p  pThe theory seemed sound so I pushed it into an existing MySQL based genome project and came up with a table structure likep  precodeCREATE TABLE spatialfeature    spatialfeatureid int10 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   externalid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,   externaltype int3 unsigned NOT NULL,   location geometry NOT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY spatialfeatureid,   SPATIAL KEY sflocationidx location  ENGINEMyISAM codepre  pstrongcodeexternalidcodestrong represents the identifier of the entity we have encoded into this table amp strongcodeexternaltypecodestrong encodes the source of this. Everything looked good and I pushed in some preliminary data 30,000 rows which seemed to work well. When this increased past the 3 million row mark MySQL refused to use the spatial index and was slower when it was forced to use it 40 seconds vs. 5 seconds using a full table scan. When more data was added the index started to be used but the performance penalty persisted. Forcing the index off brought the query down to 8 seconds. The query Im using looks likep  precodeselect count from spatialfeature where MBRIntersectsGeomFromTextLineString7420023 1, 7420023 1, location codepre  pThe data going into this is be very dense along the Y dimensions think of it like youve  recorded the position of every building, telephone box, post box and pigeon on a very long road. Ive done tests of how RIndexes behave with this data in Java as well as others in the field have applied them to flatfile formats with success. However no one has applied them to databases AFAIK which is the goal of this test.p  pHas anyone out there seen a similar behaviour when adding large quantities of data to a spatial model which is not very disparate along a particular axis The problem persists if I reverse the coordinate usage. Im running the following setup if thats a causep  ul liMacOS 10.6.6li liMySQL 5.1.46li ul  pHelpp  pAlso bringing in explain plan inp  precode  id  selecttype  table            type  possiblekeys    key   keylen  ref   rows     filtered  Extra           1  SIMPLE       spatialfeature  ALL   sflocationidx  NULL  NULL     NULL  3636060     33.33  Using where   1 row in set, 1 warning 0.00 sec codepre  pThe rewritten SQL looks like the followingp  precodeselect count0 AS count from arabidopsisthalianacore7609.spatialfeature where intersectsgeometryfromtextLineString7420023 1, 7420023 1,arabidopsisthalianacore7609.spatialfeature.location codepre  pStill not highlighting why this querys performance is so poorp  pAfter reading the article posted by Fraser from a hrefhttprickonrails.wordpress.com20090330bigolemysqlspatialtableoptimizationtricksrickonrailsa it seems like the problem is all to do with the index not being in memory. If I apply similar techniques to those mentioned in the article making key buffer very big indeed and I then force the query to use the index query times plumet. We still see a lag between querying a region amp then searching for a subset of the region but its all pointing to getting the load of the indexes correct.p  pWhats the moral of the story RIndexes in MySQL have quite poor performance until they are in memory and then they have excellent performance. Not really a good solution for what I wanted to do wit them but still it provides an interesting angle on MySQL.p  pThanks for all the help people.p

Negative 56957 pIm designing a multithreaded server with a thread pool.  This system is designed to use persistent TCP connections, as clients will maintain connects close to 247.  The problem I run into is how to manage shutdowns.  Currently, a connection comes in through acceptlistenfd.... and gets assigned to a work order struct.  This struct is dumped onto the work queue, and is picked up by a thread.  From this point on, this thread is devoted to the current connection.  My code inside the thread isp  precode Function which runs in a thread to handle a request  void  handlereq void in    ssizet n   char read    Convert the input to a workorderptr    workordert workorderptr  workordert in    while servshutdown         ampamp nrecvworkorderptrgtsockfd,ampread,1,0  0        printfRead a character cn,read      printfPeer has shutdown.n     Free the workorder memory    closeworkorderptrgtsockfd   freeworkorderptr   return NULL  codepre  pWhich simply listens to the socket and echos the characters indefinitely, and operates correctly when the client terminates the connection.  You see the servshutdown part in the while loop  this is my attempt to get the thread to break out of its loop on a shutdown signal.  When a SIGINT is caught, the global variable is set to 1.  Unfortunately, the program is currently blocking on the recv statement, and wont check this flag until another character is read.  I want to avoid that, since it could be an arbitrary amount of time before another character is sent on this connection.p  pAlso, I read on another post here that its better to use select than accept to wait on a socket connection, but I didnt quite understand.  Would you do a select to wait, and then do an accept right after that  Im not sure how select creates a socket connection.  I ask this, because if my understanding of select is cleared up, maybe it applies to the question I am askingp  pAlso also, how do I detect the case where a connection simply times out  p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I think I may have finally found a solution, after further diggingp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2486335wakeupthreadblockedonacceptcallWake up thread blocked on accept callap  pBasically, I could create a global pipe and have each thread do a select on its own socketfd as well as this global pipe.

Negative 56957 pI have a list of elements containing a few particular special elements and I need to find the neighbors of these elements in constant time. This sounds easy using a doubly linked list simply store references to the nodes containing these particular elements and check their previous and next nodes. I also prefer using a linked list since I constantly remove and add elements. The list is large and performance is particularly important.p  pHowever, it seems that Javas LinkedList does not allow me to store the node containing an element. Is that right If so, is there a clean way of doing what I need to do This shouldnt be hard, but I didnt find a solution.p  pThis needs to work with the list changing constantly and I prefer not having to update anything during the changes for example, if I used an array, I would have to constantly update their indices whenever they moved in the array. Furthermore, I might need in the future to traverse the list starting from that special node without wasting time to find that node which would also be easy in a lowlevel implementation of linked list, so Id be even more thankful for a solution that also solved that.p  pEdit Thanks for the answers. I was hoping for a solution that didnt involve implementing my own version of a linked list, though. Is there onep

Negative 56957 pI am in a situation where I want to dynamically generate getters and setters for a class at runtime in a similar manner to what NSManagedObject does behind the scenes.  From my understanding, this is possible using resolveInstanceMethod on a specific class.  At this point, you would have to use classaddMethod to dynamically add the method based on the selector.  I understand this at a theoretical level, but I havent delved much into the objc runtime, so I was curious if there were any great examples of how to do this.

Negative 56957 pI am writing an embedded application designed to run at about 37 MHz so speed is CRITICAL. also the device only has 32K of RAM. strongDynamic memory allocation is NOT and option.strong That said...p  pI am writing a buffering program which requires circular buffers with different queue lengthsp  ul li4x 1024 int  meaning more than this is wanted if availableli li4x 256 intli li1x 256 int with a different application than the one aboveli li1x 2048 int  meaning more than this is wanted if avaliableli ul  pI have implemented it in the following code. You will note that I have created 2 of the buffers as an array of size 1, this is because I want to access all buffers using the same ReadBuff and WriteBuff functions. My problem is that when you pass a structure pointer to a function, the compiler expects that the pointers datatype is the same. Passing a pointer to a BuffType2 datatype to a function that is expecting a BuffType1, however, is somewhat illegal in C and may or may not work properly even though the structure of the structures is exactly the same with the exception of the queue size. The only way I can see to solve this problem is to dynamically allocate the size of my queue after I create the various structure arrays that I need. p  pIt would also be good for you to know that I have designed the buffers to read from the tail and write to the head and it is designed such that when the head and tail indexes pass the buffer size it overflows to 0.p  pHere is a bit of codep  precode     Macro Definitions    The following sizes MUST be 2n define BUFFTYPE1SIZE    0h400   1024     define BUFFTYPE2SIZE    0h100   256  define BUFFTYPE3SIZE    0h100   256  define BUFFTYPE4SIZE    0h800   2048      define BUFFTYPE1QMASK  BUFFTYPE1SIZE0h1   all ones  define BUFFTYPE2QMASK  BUFFTYPE2SIZE0h1   all ones  define BUFFTYPE3QMASK  BUFFTYPE3SIZE0h1   all ones  define BUFFTYPE4QMASK  BUFFTYPE4SIZE0h1   all ones     Error Codes define ERRORBUFFEMPTY    1      The buffer is empty  define ERRORBUFFDNE      2      The buffer does not exist       Test for Buffer Empty define BUFFEMPTY      Buffer.Head  Buffer.Tail   Test for data in buffer define BUFFNOTEMPTY  Buffer.Head  Buffer.Tail    Test for Buffer Full define BUFFFULL Buffer.Head  1 amp Buffer.Mask  Buffer.Tail       Structure Definitions    Buffersqueues  These need to be global to allow use in interrupts typedef struct BuffType1          int Head         0     int Tail         0     int Mask         BUFFTYPE1QMASK     char Full    false     char Empty   true     int Q[BUFFTYPE1SIZE]      typedef struct BuffType2          int Head         0     int Tail         0     int Mask         BUFFTYPE2QMASK     char Full    false     char Empty   true     int Q[BUFFTYPE2SIZE]      typedef struct BuffType3          int Head         0     int Tail         0     int Mask         BUFFTYPE3QMASK     char Full    false     char Empty   true     int Q[BUFFTYPE3SIZE]      typedef struct BuffType4          int Head         0     int Tail         0     int Mask         BUFFTYPE4QMASK     char Full    false     char Empty   true     int Q[BUFFTYPE4SIZE]            Global Variables    FIFO Ring buffers  These need to be global to allow use in interrupts struct BuffType1 MyBuff1[4]     struct BuffType2 MyBuff2[4]     struct BuffType3 MyBuff3[1]     struct BuffType4 MyBuff4[1]           Functions     int ReadBuffstruct BuffType1 BufferPtr Parameters     struct BufferPtr                         this is a pointer to the buffer you wish to read Returns        int                         if empty     error code                         if not empty  The value that was popped off the buffer Description    This function returns the value at the tail of the                     buffer or an error if the buffer is empty.

Negative 56957 pIve got a Launch Daemon that runs as root outside of the user context.  This Daemon is always running and monitoring a server.  On occasion, my Daemon will get a command from the server telling it to display something to the user. Obviously I cant do this from a Launch Daemon since its not running in a WindowsServer environment  so the other option is to spawn a separate process for each user that has access to be able to display a GUI.p  pOne option I have is to make a Launch Agent and have the OS start it up for me. The launch agent could then communicate with the Launch Daemon to determine when something needs to be displayed.p  pThe problem is this though the server will sometimes provide updates of the actual binary files. So the server would send the Launch Daemon a series of files which it is expected to copy out on top of the existing files. If I have a Launch Agent running, how can I shut it down so that the agent itself can be updated Likewise, how could I start the Agent back up after the update is donep

Negative 56957 pA little background about my usage casep  pI am a lifelong writer and artist who has recently taken the first steps into making a career of it independently. Essential to my plan is having a single website that represents me on the internet, as a hub for all of my endeavors.p  pIve taken care of the planning phase for the most part. Ive made a mockup of the front page to solidify my design concept, and I know the functions of the four areas of the site. The front page is a blpg where I will post information pertinent to my work. A smaller second column to the right will have a box that cycles through displaying the five most recent content updates, and a box which gives visitors the opportunity to donate if they wish.p  pA projects page will provide a listing of my ongoing projects, displayed with an image, a title and a brief description the image will serve as a link to more indepth information in the form of either an individual page for the project, an overlay, or an expanding form. Ive not decided which and am open to suggestions, certainly.p  pThere will be a forum which Id customize to match the sites minimalist, readabilityfocused design, and which Id use to cultivate a persistent community. Finally, there will be a store through which visitors may buy my productsinitially ebooks, eventually music, prints, physical books and moredirectly from my site.p  pAll that being said, what language is optimal for the purpose Obviously, people will have varying definitions of optimal. In my case, though I have only two years of coding experience, I am a quick study when it comes to programming languages, so I am willing to undertake a language that might be considered more difficult if it yields the rewards I want. Ideally, the language in question would provide the granularity to produce the site as described without having to compromise on features, but would also be maintainable as all areas of the the site will frequently be updated with new content. Keeping the resource overhead of the site low is also a plus.p  pPlease provide detailed answers, and feel free to ask for further specifics if it will help refine your answer.p  pEDIT I have experimented with various CMSsSquarespace, Wordpress and Drupaland have been disappointed with the experience. I would rather learn a programming language and have the skill than continue to fight someone elses code to get it to do what I want, while receiving radiosilence from their communities.p
Negative 56957 pThis may be better directed to Microsoft support, but was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to why this is happening.p  pI created a simple C DLL like the followingp  precodesimpledll.h class simpledll    public     declspecdllexport simpledll     declspecdllexport simpledll   someheader.h include ltstringgt const stdstring SomeStringLIm Leaking  simpledll.cpp include simpledll.h include someheader.h some code to generate memory leak debug messages simpledllsimpledll code to register for memory leak debug messages simpledllsimpledll codepre  pNext, I make a generic MFC SDI single document interface application using the default settings in VS 2010. In MainFrm.h I include simpledll.h and create a member variable simpledll mSimpleDLLp  pHeres where it gets interesting. If I compile both the DLL and the MFC application targeting v100 both using the MDd switch, simply starting and then closing the application generates a memory leak. If I change the Use of MFC setting in the MFC app to use MFC in a static library, the leak goes away. Then, if I recompile the DLL targeting v90 and recompile the MFC app using the DLL version of MFC, no memory leak. Switch the DLL to use v100 and the MFC app to use v90 and no memory leak. In fact, the only combination that seems to generate a memory leak is when both the DLL and the MFC app target v100 and the MFC app is using MFC as a shared DLL. I even tried this with the VS11 developer preview and when targeting v110, everything worked fine.p  pHas anyone run into this issue Is it limited just to the SDI MFC app in VS2010 What could be causing these leaks Im assuming it has something to do with the DLL being terminated prior to calling the destructor of the SomeString constant, but why would using MFC as a DLL affect thatp

Negative 56957 pI have spent the last week or so updating my web application to a couple of plugins from JQuery UI, such as autocomplete and dialog. In the past, I have used separate plugins to achieve the same like autocomplete and jqModal. The thing is, the more I play with JQuery UI the more I find issues and complexities that didnt exist in other plugins. Yes, its modular and allows one to build upon the core plugins and interactions, but it seems to lack features that were just built in to other plugins that are distributed individually. Also, it seems to me that JQuery UI adds another layer over of development JQuery and my current application, especially with its own theming and complicated CSS classes.p  pSo I am thinking of moving back to just combining separate plugins in to one minified JS file. Is that the wrong path to choose Is it not okay to combine individual autocomplete, form, modal window, datepicker plugins etc.p

Negative 56957 pIm having a heckuva time finding this, but Im pretty sure I did it before a dozen years ago and I know other apps do it, like procmon.  I want to monitor a certain API call, or handful of calls, and see whos making them.  Specifically RegSetValue and RegSetValueEx.  Ive put in a system hook with WHCALLWNDPROC and can pick up calls by other apps, and track back to the app that makes them, so I have the app name, but I dont know which calls theyre making.  p  pSo, right now I get a callback.  The CallWndProc callback gets a CWPSTRUCT structure that has a message , but Im not exactly sure what to equate it to, when its an API call and not a message call.  I can look up the process and get the process name, and know some call was made, and see the parameters, but what actual call it was, Im not sure how to identify.  For instance, how do I identify it as RegSetValue, and not, say, LoadLibraryp  pWhat am I missing herep
Negative 56957 pIm building a classifieds website of adverts where I want to store a count of the number of views of each advert which I want to be able to display in a graph at a later date by day and month etc.. for each user and each of their adverts.  Im just struggling with deciding how best to implement the mysql database to store potentially a large amount of data for each advert.p  pI am going to create a table for the page views as follows which would store a record for each view for each advert, for example if advert id 1 has 200 views the table will store 200 recordsp  pAdvertid unique id of advertp  pdatetime date and time of viewp  pipaddress  unique ip address of person viewing advertp  ppagereferrer url of referrer pagep  pAs mentioned I am going to create the functionality for each member of the site to view a graph for the view statistics for each of their adverts so they can see how many total views each of their adverts have had, and also how many views their advert has had each day between 2 given dates and also how many views per month each advert has had.  Ill do this by grouping by the datetime field.p  pIf my site grows quite large and for example has 40,000 adverts and each advert has on average 3,000 page views, that would mean the table has 120 Million records.  Is this too large  and would the mysql queries to produce the graphs be very slowp  pDo you think the table and method above is the best way to store these advert view statistics or is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 56957 pI am currently working on a project that needs to save out the users scores and whatnot to a PDF file. It also needs to be able to be saved in several different languages, such as English, Spanish, Turkish, Japanese, etc.p  pThe text that gets saved out is read from multiple XML and text files that are all saved with UTF8 encoding. Those files need to be encoded that way for ease of use when working with them directly in other languages, and to work with the GUI system implemented before I started working on the project.p  pCurrently, the project uses libharu to save out the PDF files and even though it works for what we have now, it needs to be expanded to include Japanese, Chinese, etc. This is where the problem arises. For now lets say that I am trying to get Japanese to work.p  pIn my research to get libharu to play nice, I found that Visual Studio converts the text from whatever encoding to ANSI. So the files went from being UTF8 to ANSI and I found that libharu does not display the text in the PDF correctly when this happens. I discovered that it only worked when the translations were converted from ShiftJIS to ANSI.p  pUnfortunately, this does NOT work with our GUI system. The GUI system needs the translations converted from UTF8 to ANSI and since we cant have every file saved twice, one in UTF8 and one in ShiftJIS, I need to get Unicode to work with PDFs. I have searched all over on how to get Unicode to work with PDF but the closest I have gotten is people saying Unicode doesnt work with PDFs and to Use other programs that have already done the work.p  pFor the life of me, I cant seem to find these programs that are only mentioned in passing. So I guess the real question is Does anyone know of a library I can use with C that will take UTF8 encoded Japaneseand other such languages that has been converted to ANSI and saves it correctly to a PDFp

Negative 56957 pThis is a weird one. p  pI have a script running under Apache 1.3, with ApachePerlRun option of modperl. It uses the standard CGI.pm module.

Of course the script cant handle that action and outputs nothing.p  pWe have some automated test scripts running to see how often this happens, and its not every time. To throw some extra confusion into the mix, after an Apache restart, the problem seems to initially disappear completely only to come back later. So whatever is causing it is somehow relieved by a restart, but we cant see how Apache can possibly take the request from one user and mix it up with another.p

Negative 56957 pFirst up we are emnotem doing TPH table per hierarchy, that would make this a lot simpler.p  pI have about 20 POCOs that all have similar properties in some cases.  The similar properties I care about are code.CreatedDatecode and code.UpdatedDatecode.  For some of the POCOs, codeUpdatedDatecode doesnt make sense, so they dont have that property.  codeCreatedDatecode will always exist, codeUpdatedDatecode may be null.  Sometimes theres a third field as well.p  pThe query to retrieve objects from the database always looks the same, regardless of which of the 20 POCOs Im querying.  However, the query was duplicated 20 times, one for each type of the object.  I was able to break out the retrieve part to an extension method off of codeIDbSetltTgtcode to do the initial lookup and joins, leaving the date range filtering as an exercise to the consumer.  Im now wanting to consolidate 20 nearlyidentical looking date range filters into one, but running into problems with query comprehension.p  pThe date filtering logic, per POCO, is that UpdatedDate should be checked and its value compared to a threshold.  If UpdatedDate was null or the property didnt exist, then CreatedDate should be used instead.p  pltbackgroundgtp  pI started by creating a static property getter on each POCO, which I named DateFields.  Its typed as an codeIEnumerableltExpressionltFuncltT, DateTimegtgtgtcode that looks like thisp  precodeget      yield return x gt x.UpdatedDate     yield return x gt x.CreatedDate     yield return x gt x.Date  codepre  pThese fields are returned in the order I want them checked, and are unique to each POCO.p  pI then created a predicate to check each value against a high and low rangep  precodepublic static bool DatesBetweenltTgt T value, IEnumerableltExpressionltFuncltT, DateTimegtgtgt dates, DateTime dateFrom, DateTime dateTo      var firstDate  dates         .Selectexpression gt expression.Compile         .FirstOrDefaultfunc gt funcvalue  null      if firstDate  null         return false      var minDate  dateFrom.GetValueOrDefaultSqlDateTime.MinValue.Value     var maxDate  dateTo.GetValueOrDefaultSqlDateTime.MaxValue.Value      var actualDate  firstDatevalue      return minDate lt actualDate ampamp actualDate lt maxDate  codepre  pHowever, as expected, when I try and use this in my codeIQueryablecode, I get a runtime exception, because theres no translation to DatesBetween in SQL.  I was hoping that by keeping the expression tree, I could ... I dunno ... keep EF happy.  The whole thing is used like thisp  precodereturn Entities     .GetEntitiesBySomeFieldfield  magic value     .Whereentity gt RepositoryExtensions.DatesBetweenentity, MyPOCO.MyDates, dateFrom, dateTo codepre  pIs what Im asking clear, and is there a way to accomplish this kind of generic filtering without doing an AsEnumerable   which does work, but doesnt accomplish my goal of filtering on the DB.p

Negative 56957 pIn my application I have several areasviews which should be accessible only for these users who have certain privilages. IF currently logged user do not has right to see given view a popup window should appear. In this moment user can give some additional information in order see the view. The point is that the user cant leave current view untill heshe provide this information. So far I think I could do this that way. First of all I defined custom AuthorizeAttribute.

Now the view which supposed to be inaccessible for user is rendered and the popup is shown.

Next, in each of the view controllers where Im displaying the objects I run some pretty similar code...p  precodeRKObjectManager objectManager  [RKObjectManager sharedManager]  objectManager.inferMappingsFromObjectTypes  YES  [objectManager loadObjectsAtResourcePathjsonnews delegateself blockRKObjectLoader loader      loader.objectMapping  [objectManager.mappingProvider objectMappingForClass[News class]] ] codepre  p...enough background. Together all this code loads zero news and zero photos. If I comment out the photos mappings, all of my news items populate and if I comment out the news mappings then my photos appear in the store.p  pRestKit cant match together each feeds content with its mapping. The keypaths specified in setMappingforKeyPath wont work because the feeds dont have anything specified. I thought maybe objectManager.inferMappingsFromObjectTypes  YES would have RestKit inspect what each feed had and choose the proper mappings, but it didnt. Also, I assumed objectMappingForClass would automatically pickup the correct mappings, but no. Does anyone have any ideas how to make this workp  pUPDATE Actually, even though RestKit is reporting that no items had been loaded when the app runs the first time, if I stop and run again I now see all 20 news items and 20 photos loaded from cache. I confirmed this by running it once, seeing the message Caching all 0 News objects to thread local storage and then immediately opening the .sqlite file and seeing all 20 items as expected.p

Negative 56957 pI am making a win32 application using c. When using the default font, the system takes care of displaying non English symbols, such as characters in Hindi. However, for some special symbols, such as the Indian Rupee symbol , it only displays a square which I think indicates that the current symbol cannot be displayed. I have installed the Rupakara font, which is capable of displaying the symbol.br I wanted to know is there any way by which I can mention that if the symbol is from the currency Range, I wish to use the Rupakara font, else the default system font. Thus, the appearance will be that whatever the user types, he gets the correct symbol for the same. I know I can individually check the values are within that range, but I want to have an API call that will set it to use this font for this range, as I can use this later for setting other fonts for different ranges as well.br Please let me know if any further details are required, or is there some other way to do the same without explicitly checking each character which range it belongs to and setting the font for the same.br Thanksp
Negative 56957 pIm working on my first android app and am having a problem trying to implement the Vibrator. What Im trying to do is have the AlertDialog display a message, and because the user might not actually have been running the app at the time, play an alarm and vibrate the phone until they close the alert. First I had it working just fine without the vibrator, then when I implemented the vibrator it stopped the alarm sound, and it no longer displayed the AlertDialog. I found out I was able to fix the problem with the alarm by executing it in a new Thread, but still no AlertDialog.

Negative 56957 pAfter watching NDC12 presentation Crafting Wicked Domain Models from Jimmy Bogard a hrefhttpndcoslo.oktaset.comAgendahttpndcoslo.oktaset.comAgendaa, I was wandering how to persist that kind of domain model.br This is sample class from presentationp  precodepublic class Member      ListltOffergt offers      public Memberstring firstName, string lastName              FirstName  firstName         LastName  lastName         offers  new ListltOffergt           public string FirstName  get set       public string LastName  get set       public IEnumerableltOffergt AssignedOffers           get  return offers            public int NumberOfOffers  get private set       public Offer AssignOfferOfferType offerType, IOfferValueCalc valueCalc              var value  valueCalc.CalculateValuethis, offerType         var expiration  offerType.CalculateExpiration         var offer  new Offerthis, offerType, expiration, value         offers.Addoffer         NumberOfOffers         return offer       codepre  pso there are some rules contained in this domain modelbr   Member must have first and last namebr   Number of offers cant be changed outsidebr   Member is responsible for creating new offer, calculating its value and assignment p  pIf if try to map this to some ORM like Entity Framework or NHibernate, it will not work. So, whats best approach for mapping this kind of model to database with ORMbr For example, how do I load AssignedOffers from DB if theres no setter   p  pOnly thing that does make sense for me is using commandquery architecture queries are always done with DTO as result, not domain entities, and commands are done on domain models. Also, event sourcing is perfect fit for behaviours on domain model. But this kind of CQS architecture isnt maybe suitable for every project, specially brownfield. Or notp  pIm aware of similar questions here, but couldnt find concrete example and solution.p

Thing is, i guess were dealing with a best practise type situation, and none of the few beginner books i have really helped with it, so i hope you guys can.p  pSo, i have two forms, one is a splashscreenstartup form and the other is the main game window.

Negative 56957 pI am in the Beginner phase of learning Java. In all docs I have read till now, its mentioned that Java uses secure references to access objects instead of memory pointers.

Negative 56957 pI am developing a full system for my company. I have VERY LITTLE understanding of jquery and this is my first time working with it significantly. I clearly need to get a book and start reading about it. Until then, please help me get this working. p  pI have a check in page where staff members will be checking in the received orders. Because an order can have multiple items, and one form the php looks through for each item to check in. p  pIf an item is received BUT not the proper item there is a field to search for the item received. The ajax then lists the search results which can be selected. There is also and ajax portion that checks to see if the device has a valid ESN IF it is in the array. p  pI built the page without the form tags. Once I completed the page and started testing, my ajax calls for the product search and check esn field were posting instead of performing their function. Before the form tag they performed perfectly. So, I then modified the product search ajax. It worked PERFECTLY and only runs itself on an enter. However, after doing the same thing to the ajax call for checking esn it WOULD NOT work. So I reverted back to the old code. The ESN check should be performed on change.. so after an enter or they tab to the next field etc... where as the product search can be just enter or on change.p  pLastly, I was trying to hide the drop down for each item my page displays once the product search returns results. Once the user selects the radio, the drop down will be shown by slideDown. You can see that commented out at the bottom but it did not work. I assume it has to do with it being an ajax call.p  pSo, basically 3 times.

Negative 56957 pI am in process of developing custom GUI generator tool its new GUI tool like glade and to achieve that i am using rubygtk2. I am a newbie to the world of ruby and gtk, so i need a help in a problem which i am struck regarding adding background image to a widget.p  pLet me explain in detail, the application i.e.,GTKwindow has two sections say left section and right section section can be frames,layouts,panned window or equivalent. Left section has a list of all widgets like Button, Label, CheckBox and so on as images. So user who needs to design the GUI will drag and drop  any widgets from left section to right sections, on dropping to right section it i.e., widget should be resizable and also draggable across right section.p  pCurrently i am adding all widgets to eventbox so that on drag n drop on right section i will get all the controls of events like dragstart, dragmotion, dragend etc..But  how can i add an image as background to eventbox, so that i have button image added to eventbox and also handle resize and drag. Concept is user should be able to resize the properties of widget that drops to right section. Need help in implementing this, i know i am missing something to achieve this. Awaiting any suggestions.p

Negative 56957 pI am using the universal framework from the link a hrefhttpsgithub.comkstenerudiOSUniversalFramework relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkstenerudiOSUniversalFrameworka. It am including the core data managed object model and other model classes inside the framework itself. But, I am having serious trouble to migrate the model. I have a single momd file like Model.xcdatamodeld and inside it are versioned model which are named like 1.xcdatamodel, 2.xcdatamodel, 3.xcdatamodel and so on.  I have also included the model in compile sources in the build phases inside the library.p  pI have also the options set for the model to infer the migration automatically. Although the model is inside the framework, it needs some reference inside the main application bundle and so I have created a link to point the file inside the framework. But, I could not get migration working. Is there some thing serious, I am missing or is it not possible to reference the modal inside the framework to migrate automatically. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 56957 pI have a situation where I am using two libraries which have duplicate header file names. For example codetimer.hcode exists in both libraries. I think the normal solution to this would be to explicitly specify the directory in the include like codeinclude ltdir1timer.hgtcode or codeinclude ltdir2timer.hgtcode so that the compiler has a clue as to which I am specifying. However, my problem is that one of the libraries I am using is not in a sub directory of my project. It exists somewhere else at a higher level. That is...p  ul liRoot ul liLibrary1li liProjects ul liProjectFolder ul liLibrary2li ulli ulli ulli ul  pThis was done so that multiple projects could reference Library1. It seemed like a good idea at the time. However, now that I have the name conflict of Library2 it creates issues. One other important detail is that I often use two different workstations. The absolute location of Library1 on these workstations is not the same, nor is the relative location with respect to the project folder the same between the two. What I have been doing to this point is adding both absolute locations to the search path of the preprocessor.p  pAnyway, Id appreciate any guidance you might offer.p

Negative 56957 pOkay, so Ive seen a lot of questions like this here, but none of the provided answers seem to work for my particular case.p  pI have a game simulation program written in two parts I wrote the actual functionality first, and then the GUI to display it all. I figured that when I was done Id just implement calls back and forth to make the two talk to one another. The backend used JOptionPane in the meantime to get user input.p  pMy problem is that now that I want to display things in the GUI, I cant figure out how to pause the running of the program to wait for that to happen. For example, I had this in my original versionp  precodeprivate static void runAttackerTurnTeam off, Team def   int counter  0 while counter lt 4 ampamp off.whoHasIt  null      Do some stuff     active  getActiveoff, def, counter     select  StringJOptionPane.showInputDialognull,                      Who Would   active.getName   Like To Attack  n                      off.whoHasIt.getName   has the ball,                     Turn   turnCount      teamName   Attacker Turn ,                     JOptionPane.INFORMATIONMESSAGE, null,                     attackerOptions, attackerOptions[0]     target  getTargetoff, def, select, counter     attackForwardactive, target         More stuff     counter    codepre  pAnd it worked just fine. But when I have a GUI that Id like to use instead of JOptionPane it all breaks down. The GUI has a codeJPanelcode containing a codeJLabelcode for the text, a codeJComboBoxcode for the list options, and a codeJButtoncode to confirm. What I would like to do is have the program pause, effectively, and wait for the user to hit the button, then take the selected item, put that in codeselectcode and continue on.p  pI cant break the method up into two parts, as I originally tried, because I need to send other things besides just the result of codeselectcode into the second part. p  pAlso, it might not be apparent from the above, but I do this about twenty or thirty times in different methods over the course of the program, so I really need a general solution rather than a quick fix.p  pI thought doing this with multiple threads might work, but I cant seem to get that right the main thread stops executing too early  the button doesnt even show up to be clicked and anyway, Id prefer something simpler.p  pAlso, in case this isnt perfectly clear, what I am really trying to do is simulate the modal property of JOptionPane within a JPanel thats embedded in the GUI, and make the method wait for the user input before continuing.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 56957 pI am attempting to use vertex arrays to render about 2097152 cubes with LWJGL no not all of them at once.  I have implemented numerous types of polygon culling to enhance my performance from around 2 FPS to about 60 FPS.  Throughout this project, I have been working with Immediate Mode rendering, and I think it is time for an upgrade.  And here is where vertex arrays come in.p  pI dont want to use VBOs so I have been experimenting with VAOs for now.  I cannot seem to get a practical or efficient rendering method down.  Everything I try gives me worse FPS than Immediate Mode, sadly to say.  Every frame I load up a FloatBuffer for every cube that has visible polygons then draw them using the common vertex array methods.  This setup gives me headaches because I get less FPS than while using Immediate Mode and not culling any polygons.p  pI think I am doing something wrong.

Negative 56957 pThis question stems from a job interview I had. The interviewer asked me about a website I had built.  I was fresh out of school and was still doing a lot of things wrong because I didnt know any better and  had no one to ask. When I laid out the website for my interviewer on the whiteboard he was surprised that I didnt use a web service to access my database. He suggested that this was not secure but didnt go into detail. They thought had never occurred to me to do this as a security measure and I thought I was wrong for not doing it. My code was all one one page. No MVC, my php connections and all my phpmysql select, inserts, etc were all written in php on the same file as my html  javascript and everything else wrong for various reasons but not the topic at the moment.  My page was protected by https and I thought that was enough. Also looking back on it he may not  have known my database was on the localhost. The confusion in the question steams from my lack of knowledge at the time and now. p  pSo the real question I guess should be, did I need to have a webservice like Soap acting as an in between  my database to make my site secureeven though it was a localhost My assumption being that the soap server would do all of the mysql statements and return the values I was interested in. Or alternatively the SAOP Sever would  get the Mysql database to execute mysq functions and the values which would I think add real security value.  I thought that because I was using server side php and https that I would be secure other than things like a mysql injection but I had other things to account for that like mysqlrealescapestring and some other stuff.p  pIn Short My question is would using soap to separate things between the main page file and the file that  actually did the php mysql select statements on a localhost add any security value vs https. Couldnt I just get the php to connect and then use the Mysql server to execute some mysql functions with the pages protected with https  Wouldnt that be secure      p  pAside from me not using an MVC model can you offer some sage advice on the https vs SOAPp  pI am trying to do some selfstudy in php.  I am working in another language now mainly writing scripts. I have a really passion for php and I want to learn but dont know where to reliably turn. p  pThanksp

Negative 56957 pHow can I generate a stencil for a ddnx operatorp  pI am writing a program that needs to calculate line derivatives in an image. If we want to calculate the simplest derivative approximation with regards to ddx, we can run the following operationp  precodediff[x]  1.0  image[x]  image[x1] codepre  pIf I want a more precise calculation of the derivative, I can increase the size of the stencil, and possibly recalculate asp  precodediff[x]  3.2  image[x]  2image[x1]  1.2  image[x2] codepre  pI have been using the finite difference method in obtaining these coefficients.p  pNow suppose I want to take the derivative in regards to dd3x, I could simply stretch the original stencil like thisp  precodediff[x]  1.0  image[x]  image[x3] codepre  pHowever, here I am not using the information from image[x1] and image[x2] and so the derivative approximation can be greatly improved. How can I generate a stencil that WILL use this information and hence be more accuratep

Negative 56957 pI am programming an app with a MinSdk of 8 and Target of 10.  In my Activities I use a BroadCastReceiver to react to the intent action of Intent.ACTIONSCREENOFF.  Pretty standard coding as per all examples.   p  pI was playing around with updating the Target API to 17 and found that when I do so, the Intent action is not broadcast, or at least not received.  Seems to only be working for me if I use a Target of 10. Even using Api 11 causes this intent action to not be broadcastreceived.  This action is NOT in my manifest and placing the registerReceiver code in either onStart or onResume did not make a difference in this case.p  pAnyone else run into this issue or is there a different method to use to catch this event for API 11 and newerp  pThanksp

Negative 56957 pWhen building our site, we found that loading web fonts significantly slowed down page rendering on mobiles, so we disabled them on smaller devices. Ive since heard you can get around this problem by saving the web font in HTML5 local storage. A friend who works at the Guardian has told me their a hrefhttpm.guardian.co.uk relnofollowmobile sitea saves its font in local storage as a base64 encoded string.p  pI can understand easily enough how to save the font, but Im trying to figure out the best way to load it into the browser when I retrieve it. Using Javascript I could append the base64 string into a style tag in the head of my page, but then Id be adding to the data size of every page when I need to be careful about page weights. Is there a more efficient way I can load the fontface CSS declaration For example, if it was in a separate CSS file the browser would cache it.p  pEDIT p  pIve figured out this example.. If the device has a small screen I check localStorage for the font data. If it doesnt exist in localStorage I do an ajax request, append the data into the head of my page and store it in localStorage. If it does exist, I just append it.

Negative 56957 pI asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17267772correlatedsubqueryinactiverecordorsqueelnearly the same questiona in probably the wrong way, so I apologize for both the near duplicate and lousy original phrasing.  I feel like my problem now is attempting to fight Rails, which is, of course, a losing battle.  Accordingly, I am looking for the idiomatic Rails way to do this.p  pI have a table containing rows of user data which is scraped from a third party site periodically.  The old data is just as important as the new data the old data is, in fact, probably used more often.  There are no performance concerns about referencing the new data, because only a couple people will ever use my service I keep my standards realistic.  But thousands of users are scraped periodically i.e., way too often.  I have named the corresponding models User and UserScrapep  pTable codeuserscode has columns codeidcode, codenamecode, codeemailcodep  pTable codeuserscrapescode has columns codeidcode, codeuseridcode, codecreatedatcode, codeaddressidcode, codeawesomesaucepreferencecodep  pNote These are not the real models  userscrapes has a lot more columns  but you probably get the pointp  pAt any given time, I want to find emthe most recentem codeuserscrapescode values associated with the data retrieved from an external source from a given user.  I want to find out that my current codeawesomeaucepreferencecode is, because lately its probably lamesauce but before, it was saucysauce.p  pI want to have a convenient method that allows me to access the newest scraped data for each user in such a way that I can combine it with separate codeWHEREcode clauses to narrow it down further.  Thats because in at least a dozen parts of my code, I need to deal with the data from the latest scrape.p  pWhat I have done so far is this horrible hack that selects the latest codeuserscrapescode for each user with a regular codefindbysqlcode correlated subquery, then I codepluckcode out the codeidcodes of the scrapes, then I put an additional codewherecode clause in any relevant query that needs the latest data.p  pThis is already an issue performancewise because I dont want to buffer over a million integers yes, a lot of pages get scraped very often then try to pass the MySQL driver a list of these and have it miraculously execute a perfect query plan.  In my benchmark it took almost as long as it did for me to write this post, so I lied before.  Performance is emsort ofem an issue, but not really.p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pSo with my codeUserScrapecode class, how can I make a method called current, as in codeUserScrape.find1337.current.whereaddressid 1234.awesomesaucepreferencecode when I live at addresses 1234 and 1235 and I want to find out what my codeawesomsaucepreferencecode is at my latest addressp

Negative 56957 pI have a collection of small helper scripts for a more complex shell script, and while this works well, I decided I wanted to reduce this into a single script for a variety of reasons.p  pSo Im thinking Ill use here documents so that I can create nested shell scripts for running either locally or remotely as appropriate. This works well enough as I can do the followp  precodebinsh nestedscriptcat ltlt NESTEDSCRIPT      Script commands NESTEDSCRIPT  echo nestedscript  sh codepre  pNot the most functional example, but the fact that I can send it to codesshcode instead makes this very useful.p  pHowever, the problem Im having is that I cant figure out how to also supply arguments to the nested script, as if I add anything to the codeshcode command then it interprets it as a file to run and ignores standard input entirely.p  pOn my local machine I can do codeecho script  sh devstdin foo barcode and it will work perfectly, but I dont believe the remote machines Im working with support the use of codedevstdincode in that way.p  pAre there any other solutions Currently Im forcing the arguments into the script string using codesedcode but that isnt a very nice way to do it.p  pFor those wondering the reason Im trying to do this this way is that my nested scripts may be running locally, or may be running remotely, depending upon whether a host is supplied. I dont really want to create files on the remote host to run but would rather just run the commands remotely, which this method seems like it would enable if I could get it to work like I want.p

Negative 56957 pI am running a website and exporting my content via XML to many real estate portals, my problem is that when i search for my own properties titles in google, he displayes some of these portals before my results in SERP, with consistente loss of traffic, because once an user lands in their site, he will continue searching for properties in their site, and not mine.p  pI already have delayed the xml exportation, meaning that the last 10 properties published in my site are hidden from xml feeds I send to portals, in order for google to have time to index my content before their content, with the hope of google understand that this content is mine, but i had no luck. So now I thought that I could remove N number of words from the description of each property I send via xml feed, so Google will understand that the content in my page is more complete than the one i send them.p  pI have the following code in my xml p  precode        descCuted  substrrowgttext,0,261               ifstrposrowgttext,  , 261  261                             desc  descCuted             else             cuteString  strrposdescCuted,  , 1               desc  substrdescCuted,0,cuteString                        line .   ltDESCRIPTIONgtlt[CDATA[.desc.... Veja a descrio completa no site mysite.com  Codigo .rowgtref.]]gtltDESCRIPTIONgt . crlf codepre  pbut it is not ok because there are some descrpitons that are very short, so I cant just specify a number of allowed characters in a description starting from the beginning, i need to start from the end, in order to remove words even in short descrptions.. and in order not to cut words in the middle, i need to be able to specify the number of words to cut from the end of the description, I know this is a bit confusing, but I have been thinking a lot about it and i am sure this is the only thing I can try. Thanks for any help. p

By flicker I mean that the deleted row briefly shows after the animation finished. p  pI suspect that something funky was happening with the animation listener, so I ended up doing the following done in the order given p  ol liDo the animation and make it persist by setting setFillAfter and setFillenabled to true li liMake the view invisible when the animation endsli liDelete the row in the databaseli liReset the animationli liReload the listviewli liMake the view visible but wait an additional 300 msli ol  pThe result deletes the row without jerkiness or flicker BUT it now feels sluggish because of extra 300 ms wait. Im also not sure if this delay works across all devices.p  pUpdate I should point out that the 300 ms delay is what makes it work. Thats weird because by that point the animation was reset and the listview has the latest data. There should be no reason why making the view visible makes the old row briefly show, rightp  pI also tried using a ViewPropertyAnimator as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16521356usinganimationonaviewpagerandsetfillafterUsing animation on a ViewPager and setFillAftera but for some reason the onAnimationEnd listener was called at emeveryem step of the animation. p  pI also read that we should implement a custom view and override its onAnimationEnd listener.

After mimicking his code, it still didnt work. The problem is now the LoaderI use a Loader to delete rows asynchronously. The Loader seems to force an additional draw call to the ListView...embeforeem the row has been deleted in the backend. And thats another cause of the flicker. Still havent figured out a workaround though.p

Negative 56957 pIm creating an app that contains a ListView with 2 columns.

Negative 56957 pThe implementation of codewcsftimecode that ships with the Visual Studio CRT seems to have a completely unbelievable bug It just doesnt support unicode, as far as I can tell.p  pInternally, it translates to singlebyte using the current singlebyte codepage, then calls codestrftimecode, then goes back to multibyte. What a joke Why do they ship a wide version if its no better than the narrow onep  pIf I call codewcsftimeLmlaut code, the umlaut works because its contained in Latin1 but the scedilla wont it comes out as codeLmlaut code.p  pAll I want is to write a wrapper around codewcsftimecode that returns UTF8 data, but I cant seem to get the full range of Unicode out of codewcsftimecode let alone codestrftimecode, no matter what I do.p  pAre these functions just fundamentally broken in the CRT Do I have to ship my own implementation just to get codestrftimecode format strings working in my crossplatform applicationp

I have assumed this probably happens when it flushes the buffer, that is actually writes to file. Please correct me if this assumption is not correct.p  pThis results in dropping the frames that arrive during that time again, I assume, based on the video result, which in turn results in a pause in the recorded video after every N frame.p  pWhen I comment this statement out, then iterations of offerEncoder method takes roughly equal time.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pHow can I solve this issue such that writing to file is smooth.Has anyone else encountered this problem. I see that many people use this code, but no one has complained so far about this issue or at least I did not find one.p  pThanks.p
Negative 56957 pFirst the big picture Im trying to synchronize two external devices through a console program on Windows 7 64bit. That is, Device 1 should trigger Device 2. For the curious, Device 1 is the NI USB6525, and Im using its Change Detection function.p  pIm using GetMessage in a while loop to wait for a message thats triggered by Device 1. Since I didnt write the software for that hardware, I cant change the fact that I have to read this message. Once that message is read, it is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms64493428vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowdispatcheda. This dispatch results in a callback to a function that performs a measurement using Device 2 and sets measurementComplete to codetruecode. Once the callback returns, the loop ends. Then I perform cleanup and the application exits.p  pThe problem is, the user should also be able to abort while waiting for the message, for example by pressing a key.

Im programming in the CodeBlocks 13.12 IDE and using the GCC. I dont have MFC or any paid products like that from Microsoft, so I cant use MFC functions or classes. Unfortunately, many of the answers I found to similar questions included MFC functions.p  pFrom my research on this issue, it seems that the keyboard messages might not have a window to go to. I tried to create a messageonly window such as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16448437howtoreceivemessagesusingamessageonlywindowinaconsoleapplicationherea, but I always get codeError 18 There are no more filescode upon calling CreateWindowEx. I can provide that code if requested, but Im not even sure that I really need to create a window. When I run codeFindWindowExHWNDMESSAGE, NULL, NULL, NULLcode, I can see that such a window already exists. I dont know whether the window that was found by that function is one that was somehow automatically created by my binary or whether its a messageonly window that was created by another program running on my computer. Besides, dont I already have a window the console windowp  pDoes anyone have any tips for how to direct keyboard input to the messaging system in my console application Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 56957 pIm new to C and typically code in Java.  I am having a difficult time understanding how the containers in C are the same and different than Im used to in Java.p  pFor the project I am doing right now, I have made my own data structure called a solarbody.  Each of these contains a name, mass, radius, and 3 data structures I made called positiont, velocityt, and accelerationt.  Hopefully these names are self explanatory.p  pI am using a vector to hold the collection of solarbody objects in my program.  I seem to have found an issue using the foreach loop I know from Java and was hoping someone could explain what happened.p  pI run a loop through the vector calling the update method solarbody.update on each object.  This calculates the new velocity and position based on the current acceleration for that iteration.  When I first set this up, I did my forloop like thisp  precodefor solarbody body bodies    body.update  codepre  pWhen I do this and print the variables, the velocities and positions are updated.  However, during my next whileloop iteration, the new values are gone and they are back to the same old values.  It seems as if the foreach loop is operating on a copy of the solarbody object and not the original.p  pOut of curiosity, I changed my for loop to thisp  precodefor int i0 iltbodies.size i    bodies.ati.update  codepre  pThis worked as I would have expected.  In Java, there is really no difference in practice in using these two loops.  What happened in this situation that I dont understandp  pThanks in advance for the help.p

Ive inserted it in the equivalent position of the Carousels navbar, changing navbarleft to navbarright .  Unfortunately, the search box overhangs the right hand side of the navigation bar by about 1520 pixels Ive also removed the Submit button from the above example, but if I put it back in, the submit button overhangs the navigation bar in the same way.  What have I done wrong herep  pEdit included the whole navbar section as requestedp

Negative 56957 pI have a UIViewController designed in Interface Builder Storyboard that contains a UISearchBar.  The UISearchBar has an auto layout constraint to pin it to the top layout guide.  In my UIViewController subclass I have an codeIBOutlet NSLayoutConstraintcode connected to the constraint so that I can adjust it in code.  Depending on user events, I hideunhide the UISearchBar by modifying the constraints codeconstantcode property between 0 and 44, which also slides up the views which are placed below the UISearchBar.  I have used this technique before and all works well.  p  pMy problem is that I am now using 4 instances of this UIViewController within a parent container UIViewController with a UITabBar.  When the UITabBar tab selection is changed, I swap in the appropriate instance using codeinsertSubViewcode.  The problem is that the UISearchBar only slides up in one of the tab page instances.  In the other 3 none of the views move.  I have used codeNSLogcode to monitor the value of the constraints codeconstantcode property and it is being changed in each instance, just not affecting the view positions.  Im guessing its something to do with the IBOutlet only recognising being connected to one instancep  pIm using Xcode 5.1 and my app is targetting iOS7.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve now realised that its only the first child view controller tab page where the repositioning of views doesnt work, the following 3 pages all work.p

Negative 56957 pI seem to be having issues with my code. I am attempting to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for my Java class. It requires this JOptionPane input type and also requires a try catch to handle exceptions. The input options are also a requirement. I cant find anything wrong with my code and I even added a System.out.println of the value in question to confirm it is the correct input when its passed to the if statement. The issue is that no matter what the input is, correct or incorrect, the exception for an incorrect input is always thrown.

The class looks like thatp  precodeclass EmailSettings       String emailAddress      static constraints            emailAddressblank false, nullable false, email true        codepre  pMy problem is I do not get the saved email addresses out of the codeemailAddressescode Object. I tried it with codelistcode, codegetEmailAddresscodelike codeemailAddresses.getEmailAddress.toStringcode, which is codenullcode, even though in the db ARE email addresses saved under this domain object, but it does not work or I get an exception.p  pAny suggestion how to get the email addresses, which are saved in the db as an arrayp  pI appreciate your answerp

Negative 56957 pThe problem is actually quite simple to formulate I need to know current CPU and memory consumption of the whole system from kernelmode driver under Windows.

In practice this means it gets called as users login to our webapp.  There can be more than one user logged in at any given time.p  hr  pThis is done using a jpa repository and some querydsl predicate.p  precodeUserDetails userDetails  userRepository.findOneLoadedUserPredicates.hasUserNameEqualsIgnoreCaseusername codepre  pThen comes the bit that is confusingp  precode    Division division  divisionRepository.findDefaultDivisionUser userDetails     User userDetails.setCurrentDivisiondivision codepre  pAnd thats it.  The setter just sets a field which is marked as Transient and then none of the code in this stack uses this value.p  pIt does have usages scattered throughout the project however, which would presumably fail there arent any tests so that could actually be the case if it was null.p  pWhat is happening here  How long do these assignments last  And I suppose on a related note, how long are the other objects lasting for  Is my mental model of this stuff as just being static method calls to read and write to the database wrong  It might explain why the application guzzles so much memory  Im assuming a cached version of each row of the database isnt hanging around  is it something more like an in memory dictionary of key value pairs for each row that gets assigned to it when they get loaded from the databasep  pWere trying to refactor away from some of nastier parts of this stuff and this has made me a bit worried that theres more magic I dont know about yetp

Negative 56957 pI have a linux application that streams data to files on a directlyattached SAS storage array. It fills large buffers, writes them in ODIRECT mode, then recycles the buffers i.e. fills them again etc.. I do not need to use OSYNC for data integrity, because I can live with data loss on crashes, delayed writing etc. Im primarily interested in high throughput and I seem to get better performance without OSYNC. However, I am wondering if it is safe if ODIRECT is used but not OSYNC, when exactly does the write system call returnp  ul lipIf the write returns after the DMA to the storage arrays cache has been completed, then my application is safe to fill the buffer again. The array itself is in writeback mode it will write to disk eventually, which is acceptable to me.pli lipIf the write returns immediately after the DMA has been initiated but not yet completed, then my application is not safe, because it would overwrite the buffer while the DMA is still in progress. Obviously I dont want to write corrupted data but in this case there is also no way that I know to figure out when the DMA for a buffer has been completed and it is safe to refill.pli ul  pThere are actually several parallel threads, each one with its pool of buffers, although this may not really matter for the question above.p

Negative 56957 pDue to issues with CORS, I cannot send cookie information through headers, so instead I need to send cookies within my body post.

Negative 56957 pHi I have a little question about these product combinations in prestashop. We are implementing a integration for our Warehouse Management System that imports products from prestashop via Webservice.p  pNow to the problem. Lets say there are a tshirt with different sizes Small, Medium, Large.p  pIf i import with apiproductsdisplayfull I got only one id for the sizes. How should i Map for example a tshirt Small with a unique id. p  pSome example i thaught of was if it was possible to combine the product id for example 1 with combination 14 than it will be 114. But its not a safe way because it may be a product id 11 with combination 4.p  pAnd in order import i got product attribute id. How to map it to correct combinationp

Negative 56957 pIve read plenty of supertypesubtype threads and Im pretty sure I am not asking the same one.p  pI have the following tables in my database. Note thatbr 1. Some security types only need Type but require no SubType, such as stocks and bonds.br 2. Securties.TypeId is a foreign key pointing to Type.ID.br 3. Securties.SubTypeId has no foreign key relationship to BondType or DerivativeType tables. And currently the data integrity is maintained by C code.p  pSince lacking of foreign key relationship is bad, I want to refactor this DB to have it. Given that this DB is already in production, whats the best way to improve it while limiting the software risk i.e., one way to do it is to combine all XXXType tables into a single table and have all SubTypeIds rearranged, but clearly that involves updating tons of records in the Securites table. So its considered a more risky approach than another one which doesnt require changing values.p  precode[Securites] ID     Name         TypeId     SubTypeId  1     Stock1       2          NULL  2     Fund1        3          NULL  3     Bond1        1          3  4     Deriv1       4          3   [Type] ID     Name  1     Bond  2     Stock  3     ETF  4     Derivative  [BondType] ID     Name  ...  2     GovermentBond  3     CorporateBond  4     MunicipalBond  ...

Negative 56957 pI have configured one Biztalk Server to run the Microsfot UDDI server. I configured one Active Directory group to be the administrators group for the UDDI.p  pWhen I use the UDDI Web User interface, I can create providers, and also I can view the data providers, tmodels, etc owned by other user using the View data owned by button.p  pI used the Microsoft.Uddi3.dll API in C to create a Windows form dialog to manage the UDDI entries in a client remote application, and I can use it to see the providers created by other users, but any modification on the providers owned by other users are throwing the Microsoft.Uddi3.UserMismatchException The entity uddixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is not owned by the publisher because Im not the real owner, even when I am an administrator within the UDDI. If I use it against the Provider created by me, the edition is working fine. The problem occurs when my user is not the one that created the provider.p  pI saw that the Web UI is using a Method called ViewAsPublisher.Setstring username under the UDDI.Web.DLL that sets the user owner you want to see its data, but I used it on the client machine with unsucessful results. I think this DLL was developed to be used in the server and have no sense to use in clients, but I need some funcionality similar to the one allowed in the Web User Interface.p  pThe Microsoft.Uddi3.dll also providesthe capability to transfer the ownership, but I only need to have the same behavior that in the Web UI, I mean modify the provider directly acting as if I were the real owner just if I belong toan administrator, publisher or coordinator group.p  pI dont know if it is a configuration problem, or it is a limitation on the Uddi3 API methods.p  pCan anyone help mep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 56957 pIn a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6749section4.1.2 relnofollowSection 4.1.2a of the OAuth 2.0 spec, there is the following set of sentencesp  blockquote   pThe authorization code MUST expire   shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A   maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is   RECOMMENDED.  The client MUST NOT use the authorization code   more than once.  If an authorization code is used more than   once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD   revoke when possible all tokens previously issued based on   that authorization code.p blockquote  pMy question is why must the authorization code be used only once This seems to force implementers of the authorization server to use an ACID database, which introduces scalability issues. Relaxation of this constraint would allow storage to be dispensed with completely.p  pI can see that allowing reuse of the auth codes would mean that if a malicious agent could get hold of an unexpired code, they could gain access to the protected resource. But OAuth 2.0 mandates TLS for some transactions and recommends it for all, which reduces the risk of code theft, and assuming that there is an agent which can listen on the channel this requirement introduces the possibility of denial of service the agent could simply submit any auth code they found. DoS can be a greater or lesser threat than breach of confidentiality, depending on the circumstances.p

Negative 56957 pMost of the classes in Javas Collections Framework are unsynchronized by default, but can be made into something synchronized if you need them to be threadsafe. The synchronization has a performance penalty, so if youre writing something that doesnt need to be threadsafe, youre better off with the unsynchronized version.p  pBut codeConcurrentSkipListMapcode doesnt follow this scheme. There is no unsynchronized version. Why is there not a faster unsynchronized codeSkipListMapcode for applications that dont require thread safety, in line with the rest of the Collections Frameworkp  pAll I can think is that the simplest implementation of a Skip List is already threadsafe, so there would be no performance penalty for having a synchronized version. This would make some kind of sense, but a look at the source code doesnt quite bear that out. Although there are no codesynchronizedcode blocks in the code, the Javadoc does start withp  blockquote   pThis class implements a concurrent variant of SkipLists...p blockquote  pwhich suggests that its going out of its way to modify the algorithm to make it threadsafe. Later on, we readp  blockquote   pThe basic idea in these lists is to mark the next pointers of deleted nodes when deleting to avoid conflicts with concurrent insertions...p blockquote  pwhich also sounds as though there is some kind of overhead involved.p  pIs it just that this overhead is so small that its not worth having a nonthreadsafe codeSkipListMapcodep

Negative 56957 pI am new to AngularJS, so forgive me if this is obvious, but I am looking for someone who can answer this tricky question.  I am implementing an application, and need to pass some parameters to a particular view to display details about a book.   Basically I would like to be able to use the following routing expressionsp  precodebookApp.config[routeProvider, functionrouteProvider      routeProvider.         whencatalog,              templateUrl cataloglist.htm,             controller catCtrl         .         whenbooktitlechapter,              template chapterdetail.htm,             controller chapterCtrl         .         otherwise             template oops ... do not understand that route,              ] codepre  pThe expression codebooktitlechaptercode should allow me to pass in the name of the title of a book.  I am expecting to be able to pass ANY title of any book in there.  To make sure that things are properly delimited, I am going to URL encode the title value, so that in the encoded value there will be no slashes and the value will be clearly delimited by the slash characters.   This is the normal way to construct URLs that contain values.p  pThe problem is that there exist book titles that contain the slash character e.g. codeThe 35 solutioncode   This is URL encoded as codeThe32F5Solutioncode.  So can construct a URL like thisp  precode appbookThe32F5SolutionThe20Beginning codepre  pHowever, my experience seems to show that the entire value is URL decoded BEFORE it is broken into parameters   This means that any data value with a slash in it, will be emmisinterpretedem as two values, and the pattern matching of the route parameters is broken, and only the first half of the value is passed in.  Furthermore, the chapter might have a slash in the name as well.p  pIf I was making a REST service, I would URL encode the value, and the URL will be parsed into pieces BEFORE each piece is decoded.  For example, I can use query parameters in a URL like thisp  precodeapp.jsptitleThe32F5SolutionampchapterThe20Beginning codepre  pand this will work correctly.  Using URL encoding, I can pass ANY string value in the title.  I would have expected route parameters to do the same thing ... but I already mentioned I am NEW to AngularJS.p  pTo decode the code2Fcode into a slash BEFORE determining the pieces seems like a very serious bug.

Negative 56957 pSo, I have a base class that I want to extend most but not all of my domain classes from. The goal is that I can add the six audit information columns I need to any domain class with a simple codeextendscode. For both creation and updates, I want to log the date, user, and program based on request URI. Its using a Grails service called CasService to find the currently logged on user. The CasService then uses Spring Security and a database call to get the relevant user information for that field.p  pThe trouble is, if I do this, then Im going to have to Mock the CasService and request object in any unit test that tests a domain that uses these classes. That will also impact unit tests for services and controllers that use these domains. Thats going to make unit testing a bit of a pain, and increase boiler plate code, which is what I was trying to avoid.p  pIm fishing for better design options, and Im open to suggestion. My current default is to simply add the same boiler plate to all my domain classes and be done with it.

For this would it be best to write on code that assigns every grid point a set of angles theta, phi and then plot with e.g gnuplotp  pAny help is appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 56957 pI am writing a PHP  JavaScript application. On some page loads, an AJAX request is made to obtain the data to populate the page. These AJAX requests use tokens to prevent CSRF, and are stored in PHP sessions.p  pTokens are checked when a request is made, and if they are valid they then get deleted. So my set up is a token is generated in PHP, applied to the HTML body tag and then obtained and stored in a variable using JS. I only generate one token, so the same token is used for forms. Therefore a dilemma I now face is that if a page has a form and fires AJAX requests on load, the token gets deleted once it has been checked and deemed to be valid via the AJAX request. So the form will fail submission because the token its using is not valid anymore. I am seeking a suitable and sensible fix solution.p  pI have two ideas first I just use a separate token for AJAX requests, which means I have two sessions dedicated to tokens. Or second, I could add some additional logic to my token class which would not delete the token on AJAX requests, so it remains valid. The second option would also allow for multiple AJAX requests using the same token too, so I could do stuff like infinite scrolling using the same token. However, I am not sure if the second solution is very secure or sensible.p  pSo my question is, does either of my two solutions sound like a good fix or is there a better way to handle my token verification problem And can my application become exposed to any security flawsp  pCheersp

Negative 56957 pIm seeing some occasional missing data with a datagram channel in a tool Im developing. UDP is part of the requirement here, so Im mostly just trying to troubleshoot the behavior Im seeing. The tool is being developed with Java 7 another requirement, but the computer on which Im seeing the behavior occur is running on a Java 8 JRE.p  pI have a decorator class that decorates a call to DatagramChannel.send with some additional behavior, but the call effectively boils down to thisp  precodepublic int send ByteBuffer buffer, SocketAddress target  throws        some additional decorating code that cant be shared follows      int bytesToWrite  buffer.remaining     int bytesWritten  decoratedChannel.sendbuffer, target      if bytesWritten  bytesToWrite           log the occurrence         return bytesWritten       codepre  pThere is an additional bit of decoration above this that performs our own fragmentation as part of the requirements of the remote host. Thus the source data is always guaranteed to be at most 1000 bytes well within the limit for an ethernet frame. The decorated channel is also configured for blocking IO.p  pWhat Im seeing on rare occasions, is that this routine and thus the DatagramChannels send method will be called, but no data is seen on the wire which is monitored with Wireshark. The send routine always returns the number of bytes that should have been written in this case too so bytesWritten  bytesToWrite.p  pI understand that UDP has reliability issues for which we have our own data reliability mechanism that accounts for data loss and other issues, but Im curious about the behavior of the Datagram channels implementation. If send is returning the number of bytes written, should I not at least see a corresponding frame in Wireshark Otherwise, I would expect the native implementation to possibly throw an exception, or at least not return the number of bytes I expected to write p

Negative 56957 pThere are plugins to format code using the Eclipse formatter from Maven, and its not hard to find instructions to run it from the command line. However, this formatter does not organizeoptimize the import statements.p  pThe reason I want to do this is that I have generated some code, using a single pass over a template. It would be complex to work out up front what imports are needed and what are not, so I end up importing a lot of stuff that ends up not being used. A formatter that cleans up unused imports afterwards would solve the problem neatly.p  pSpecifically, I want to remove unused imports automatically, but not from within the IDE. How can I do thisp

Negative 56957   pHello,p  pIm currently working on a word prediction in Java. For this, Im using a NGram based model, but I have some memory issues...p  pIn a first time, I had a model like this p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class NGram implements Serializable      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L      private transient int count     private int id     private NGram next      public NGramint idP          this.id  idP       codepre  pBut its takes a lot of memory, so I thought I need optimization, and I thought, if I have hello the world and hello the people, instead of get two ngram, I could keep in one that keep Hello the and then have two possibilty  people and world.p  pTo be more clear, this is my new model p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class BNGram implements Serializable      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L     private int id     private HashMapltInteger,BNGramgt next     private int count  1      public BNGramint idP          this.id  idP         this.next  new HashMapltInteger, BNGramgt       codepre  pBut it seems that my second model consume twice more memory... I think its because of HashMap, but I dont how to reduce this I tried to use different Map implementations like Trove or others, but it dont change any thing.p  pTo give you a idea, for a text of 9MB with 57818 different word different, but its not the total number of word, after NGram generation, my javaw process consume 1.2GB of memory... If I save it with GZIPOutputStream, it takes arround 18MB on the disk.p  pSo my question is  stronghow can I do to use less memorystrong  Can I make something with compression as the Serialization. I need to add this to a other application, so I need to reduce the memory usage before...p  pThanks a lot, and sorry for my bad english...p  pZiMathp

Negative 56957 pI am writing a method that returns one double number based on an input parameter. Since some inputs will not have valid return values, I want the method to indicate failure, and to use NSError to provide details on the error.

Negative 56957 pI am creating an app for android and how i have set it up is that i have a login activity thats lets you login, but it also checks if you have a saved token first and if it does immediately starts the main activity and finishes, so to the user it looks like they were taken straight into that app. Then in the main activity i make a call to make sure the key is still good, and if it passes nothing happens but if it doesnt the user is logged out. p  pSo here is the issuebr This works really well except for when i get to the notifications. I have set the pending intent to launch the login activity because thats what the flow of my app starts with but the issue is, onNewIntent never gets hit because if the user is logged the login activity finishes as soon as it is created, thus not allowing me to pass it on the main activity where i would like to handle the logic. Whats the correct course of action here should i have the notification just launch the main activity i would like to avoid that because i would have to redo a lot some of the logic of my app. my app already works as wanted. if someone opens the notification while in my app the notification bar is just dismissed. and nothing happens, and if they are outside the app it launches the login activity and correctly starts the app.p  pcreating the notification inside my service  p  precodemNotificationManager  NotificationManager                 this.getSystemServiceContext.NOTIFICATIONSERVICE          Intent i  new Intentthis, LoginActivity.class         i.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP                  Intent.FLAGACTIVITYSINGLETOP         i.putExtratype,type         PendingIntent contentIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitythis, 0, i, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT           NotificationCompat.Builder mBuilder                  new NotificationCompat.Builderthis                            .setSmallIconR.drawable.microphonenotififcationicon                         .setLargeIconBitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources,R.drawable.iclauncher                         .setAutoCanceltrue                         .setContentTitleYapTap                         .setStylenew NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle.bigTextmsg                         .setDefaultsNotification.DEFAULTSOUND                         .setTickermsg                         .setNumbernum                         .setContentTextmsg          mBuilder.setContentIntentcontentIntent         mNotificationManager.notifyNOTIFICATIONID, mBuilder.build codepre  pin my login activity  p  precodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     ifuserLoggedIn        if user is logged in start next activity and finish         Intent i  new Intentthis, MainActivity.class         i.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP         startActivityi         finish        Override protected void onNewIntentIntent intent      super.onNewIntentintent     Notification intent received here correctly  codepre

Negative 56957 pI have an IIS rewrite rule that Im trying to use. When I set the Action to redirect its working fine. Likewise, if I select Custom response and set some arbitrary status code, Im getting that back in the HTTP response, so I know the rule is matching for my URL. However, I need to rewrite this to act as a reverse proxy but as soon as I change the action to Rewrite it doesnt take effect.p  pI have installed the Application Request Routing Module and enabled the proxy under Server proxy settings as per this page a hrefhttpwww.iis.netlearnextensionsurlrewritemodulereverseproxywithurlrewritev2andapplicationrequestrouting relnofollowhttpwww.iis.netlearnextensionsurlrewritemodulereverseproxywithurlrewritev2andapplicationrequestroutinga.p  pIve tried everything from restarting the sites, the server, IIS, the W3p process and nothing takes effect. Ive added the rule at a server level as required and confirmed in the ApplicationHost.config file that it is there and correct.p  pAny ideas what isnt causing this to fire Ive seen a few similar posts here on SO, but none of them either have a solution or work for me in this instance.p  pstrongEDIT OK, so if I change the application pool from integrated to classic, the rule seems to fire which is weird as the rule is at a server level. However, My site requires integrated mode to function. Anyone know whats going on herestrongp

Negative 56957 pI am creating a notification app, which will alert user after they set a reminder notification. My current implementation logic isp  ol liCreate a Service, which starts running in background when user opens their app.li liIn onCreate method of service, I am implementing a Timer task which will repeat after 5000ms interval and will call a method, which will check all reminders set by user and notify user if any reminder is set for current time.li liI use broadcast receiver  to run the service on BootCompleted event, if in case user turns off their phone. li ol  pThis implementation is working good, I have faced no issues with it, but my concern is that is this a good practice Keeping in mind that service running and checking every 5 secs will consume battery. Also if user turns on Stamina Mode, Power saving mode or any such mode, will OS kill my service. Is there anything I can do to give priority to my Service not to be killed.p  pIf there is any other more efficient way to implement this sort of task, I want to implement that in my project.p  pLooking forward for suggestions.p  pMuch Appreciated.p

Instead it results in recursion since at least one clicks event occured and inBasketStream is updated on operation completion. Zip wont help much as well since in basket stream might be changed from another place and theres, hence, a scenario for stacking multiple boolean values, which will make zip take obsoletejust the next one, while there could be more values already stacked upon value on next click event. p  pSo, I need a way to get strongthe laststrong value from the boolean stream and use it whenever click event happens. Of course, I could use a boolean field for that subscribe to inBasketStream and update it onNext but I dont feel that it complies with functional and there has to be a composition to handle this issue without additional fieldsvariables. p  pThanks.p  pP.S. both observables are hotp

Now I have the main parts of the page looking how I want them to look, but the bootstrap navbar also received the CSS changes, so the font size and many other aspects of the navbar are now changed, causing inconsistency with the rest of the site.p  pQuestion Is there a way to tell the page not to apply the internal style to the navbar so it uses the external style insteadp  pPardon me if this is an ill formed question, or just something you cant even remotely do  shouldnt do with CSS, Im very new to using CSS with HTML and still gaining my bearings.

I want to be able to have an option to say restart this PC but run the program after the PC restarts.p  pAlternatively, If I could actually just write the patch directly to the JAR file in the runOnce without having to use a batch file, that would be even better. I tried putting start java jar etc... into the runOnce but it doesnt work.p

Negative 56957 pI am wanting the scroll position of the document element in JavaScript, since I cannot use jQuery.p  pstrongQuestionstrong What would be the JavaScript code for getting the documents vertical scroll position  I need to make it compatible as far back as IE 8 and all modern browsers. p  pstrongUPDATE 1strong  I reviewed the 2 answers given as duplicates of this. The first one does address my problem though its not focusing on a crossbrowser solution, but the second one is way off what I need. I need the vertical scroll position of document and not scrolling to the top of document. The second post talks about using a link or going step by step to top of document, which does not address my question.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Based on the answer provided by minitech, I came up with following functions to determine scroll positions that works across all modern browsers as well as upto IE 8.

Negative 56957 pI am a M.Sc CE student, and My thesis is about server load balancing using SDN. I am very much Obligated to you if answer my question. p  phow can I do tcp session migration is this possible with TCPRepair  You can find some information about TCPRepair here a hrefhttpslwn.netArticles495304 relnofollowTCP connection repairap  pMy scenario is something like this I have server farm and I want to Implement Layer 7 load balancer Contentaware load balancer. For this, I need to get first 4 packet and then allocate a client request to appropriate server in my cluster according to HTTP GET header. I need to establish a TCP connection between client and SDN controller I have done this part, and I have received HTTP GET message from the client.I already have some information about the content that client need to get like content name, content length and so on. Next, I need to migrate this TCP connection to one of my servers with have this content and have better status in term of bandwidth utilization and maybe other parameters and change flow table of switch to forward the rest of the packets to this server.  Is it possible with TCPRepair I am so confused If yes and if it is possible for you, Please send me a sample code that indicate using TCPRepair. Regardsp
