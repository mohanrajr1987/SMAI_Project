Positive 2433 pLogEvent represents information like log level, message, user, process name, ... Some of these properties values require pretty much effort for generation, e. g. the process name. Those properties generated values are emusuallyem not changed, BUT despite this fact it should be possible to change them. p  pI considered the prototype pattern starting with a protoype, whose generic properties are preallocated. The protoype stays the same object during the lifetime of the application, but its properties values might change as described above. New LogEvent objects should use the current prototypes values, objects created before the change should continue using the old values, that means, referencing the prototype from the real LogEvent object is not an option.p  pHowever the real LogEvent requires some properties to be not null, whereas this requirement is not useful for the prototype. I would like to prevent invalid objects of LogEvent. However if I use usual protoype pattern I would have to add a constructor to create the prototype, but this constructor would not create a valid object and I want to avoid, that an invalid object the prototype itself or a clone of it is used accidentally.p  pI spent some time on searching a solution, but the approaches listed below are pretty ugly.

Positive 2433 h2What I want to doh2  pI want to include logging in my tests preferably using System.Diagnostics such that each test case writes to its own log file lets say the format is testcasename.log. strongThe catchstrong is that the logging statements will not be in the test methods themselves, but in a separate class hierarchy, which the different test methods will share. An examplep  pTest classesp  ol liBaseTestClass abstractli liDerivedTestClassFirefox BaseTestClass has test methods like TestAFirefox,TestBFirefoxli liDerivedTestClassChrome BaseTestClass has test methods like TestAChrome, TestBChromeli ol  pOperationClass includes basic actions done by tests and has the logging statements Lets say it has methods OperationA, OperationB, etc. Now different test methods can share these operations. So if OperationA has codeLogger.LogInfoDoing operation Acode, then this message should go to the correct log file according to what test called it. The tests need to be able to run in parallel. I will be using MSTest if it matters.p  h2My current solutionh2  pI made a static Logger class like below   p  precode    public static class Logger              stores tracesource objects against tracesource names same as test method name         entries are added in this by the [TestInitialize] method in BaseTest, as it has access to the calling test method name from TestContext         private static Dictionaryltstring, TraceSourcegt TraceSourceMap  new Dictionaryltstring, TraceSourcegt         automatically determines which log file the message should go to         from the stack trace and test method naming conventions         private static string GetCallingTestName                      StackTrace stackTrace  new StackTrace              StackFrame[] stackFrames  stackTrace.GetFrames              foreach StackFrame stackFrame in stackFrames                              if stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithfirefox                      stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithchrome                      stackFrame.GetMethod.Name.ToLower.EndsWithie                                      return stackFrame.GetMethod.Name                                           return null                   private static TraceSource GetTraceSourceObject                      string traceSourceName  GetCallingTestName             TraceSource ts  TraceSourceMap[traceSourceName]             return ts                  public static void LogInfostring logMessage                                            TraceSource ts  GetTraceSourceObject             ts.TraceInformationString.Format[0] 1n, DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay, logMessage               codepre  pThe [TestInitialize] method in BaseTestClass sets up TraceSource with the name as the calling test method name, adds the listener a log file with same name as test name and then adds this object in Logger classs dictionary.p  pThe strongissuestrong is that this design completely depends on test naming. The tests must have firefox, chrome, etc. in the end, and none of the other methods can end like this, because then itll be impossible to tell through stack trace what is a test method or what is an operation unless I impose further pattern in test method naming. On the other hand, this is very less code and will work perfectly even if I run tests in parallel.p  h2Problem Questionh2  pI want to know in what other way I can achieve the same result and if this design is actually that bad. One idea might be to create a logger object in [TestInitialize] of BaseTestClass recall that before this I dont know what the logging file will be as it depends on test name, so cant do this at constructor time and then somehow pass this logger to OperationClass. But then there is only one instance of logger object for the whole test class and this would be a problem if I want to run tests in parallel right As each test method logs in a different place, so each test method needs its own version of logger object.

The App is connected via Websocket to a server and I have a lot of cross realtions of vars as you can see in the drawing.p  pMy question is now How to design and split up the party in a nice way. How can I react on events in the application, so for example change the JS value of vars inside the site1 widget and the other way.. how to send for example xy via the websocket to the server..p  pThank you very much p
Positive 2433 pI am preparing an architecture for a Financial ERP, especially GL, Account Receivables etc. on ASP.Net MVC 5. I need to inject some extensibility points so that external systems can be integrated easily in future. These extensibility points can be stored procedures, scripts, performance counters, external logging and many more. You can consider this scenario as writing extension points or custom routines to Dynamics AX or Oracle EBS.p  pI know about ASP.Net filters but I dont foresee it a flexible way to provide extension points to external users. It requires modifications in code and break the Open For ExtensionClose For Modification principal. p  pI would appreciate if someone points me to some good and relevant articles or give some suggestions. p  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 2433 pThe model pretends to represent a Watch and it suppose to make all by its own, like increase the value of a watchhand, I have to apply two design patters here but Im not sure I use them correctly.p  pI tried to use the template method in the abstract classs called WatchHandTemplate where I pretend implements the method getTime, this method will use the abstract method getValue so it will be  I guess  an implementation of the template method.p  pOn the other hand I think that could be interesentig having a IncreaseI that will represent de stategy method, the idea is that as the watch always has the minor watchhand so this one needs a timer because for example the firs one could be in seconds but it also could be in minutes so the timer would help to control the real time it supposed to wait before it increase.p  pI know this is kind of hard but I really appreciate your help I need to know if its fine or how could I use these design patter in my modelp  pPS Sorry about my writing I dont speak english I do my best Thanks A lot p  pPs As Im new here I cant post images so HERE its the link to the image that contains the model p  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B6DJlt0R9X4bE43TWpnR0hQRFEviewuspsharing relnofollowhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B6DJlt0R9X4bE43TWpnR0hQRFEviewuspsharingap

Positive 2433 pLooking to figure something out about the singleton pattern.p  pIf I implement a singleton pattern like the below, what could I do so that other classes could update and see updates to fields someString and someIntp  pFrom what I read about the Singleton pattern, immutability was not one of the prerequisites. So technically could I have setter methods for the fields and change them and have these changes visible to other classes For example if I have another two classes implementing Runnable and printing Foos fields every few seconds.

Positive 2433 pI want to make a small application which will return me a pizza based on the inputs given. I want to make a medium size pizza with different inputs  1. like white dough or brown dough 2. cheese toppings of different types, say white or brown cheese 3. different toppings of onions or tomato or mushroomsp  pSo how do we decide which pattern to choose here, Builder or Decorator I feel we can use builder pattern to make pizza first and then one we can use decorator pattern and decorate the pizza based on the different toppings we choose.Am I correct in this understanding As I understand, decorator pattern is used to decorate any already existing object. To create this existing object, we would use builder pattern first.p

Positive 2433 pHi I should use strategy pattern to write code of this game. I create Country class and Character Interface. But im little confused i dont know where should i add abilitiesp  pplayer first has to select a country for his country, which could   be Latveria, Ecotopia,Dinotopia. After  selecting the country, player has to assign a class for hisher character by selecting one of the following King,Queen,Troll and Knight. Depending on its class a character   can have    different abilities a  Knight  can handle anybr kind of weapon  easily, which includesBow and Arrow, Swords, Knifes and Axes. King doesnt use any weapon, he can make strategy. Queen uses speacial Magic. Troll uses Knifes and Axes.  All types of characters can fight using its specific abilities.

Positive 2433 pIve recently started to use codeRequireJScode, which enables me to organize my code in  a nice way. So, codedefinecode and coderequirecode became my best friends.

Positive 2433 pSo I have this class Im testing. Its a helper that pulls stuff out of some  XML classes. The XML classes are kind of a Russian Doll arrangement where you have to dig through many levels to get the right thing you need. Problem is that the class under test calls many of its own methods. This makes it pretty hard to test without a bunch of redundancy. This is to say that I dont want to retest any of those low hanging fruit methods that retrieve objects from shallow locations if I can avoid it. I smell an opportunity for a refactor here but Im unsure what it should be. Note that there are often 6 and 7 levels to our Russian Doll. My intuition says that I should maybe refactor the class under test to a hierarchy of classes, roughly one for each level in our Russian Doll. Then maybe I could test one at a time without redundancy. p  pQuestions What are the patterns I should be looking at for this Is there an approach for doing this which is Composition rather than Inheritance basedp

Positive 2433 pWhen the Gang of four introduced the singleton pattern, they also had to explain, why not to use static class fields and method instead. The reason was the possibility to inherit. For Java it had sense  we cannot normally inherit the class fields and methods.p  pLater the Effective Java book appeared. And we know now that the existence of reflection destroys the singularity of the singleton class with private constructor. And the only way to make a real SINGLEton is to make it as a single item of an enumeration. Nice. I had done some myself this way.p  pBut a question remains While we cannot inherit from enumeration, what is the use of this singleton Why we dont use these old good staticclass fields and methods p  pEdit.

Since I cannot share the entire diagram on the site.p  pI need a good design and wanted to know what is the correct design for this scenario.p  pKindly let me know if you need more design information in this regards to understand the scenario more.p  pJust a note, I am actually not aiming at improving the performance, but only a very clean design concept for such a scenario.p  pAny Help is most welcomep  pThanks in Advance  Cheersp

Negative 2433 pA couple of years ago, we had a graphic designer revamp our website. His results looked great, but he unfortunately introduced a new unsupported font by the web browser. p  pAt first I was like, What... since most of our content is dynamic and there was no real way to premake all of the images. There was also the issue of multiple languages since we knew Spanish was on the horizon.p  pAnyway, I decided to create some classes to autogenerate images via GDI and programatically cache them as needed.

Negative 2433 pIm trying to figure out how to correctly use Javas Executors.  I realize submitting tasks to an codeExecutorServicecode has its own overhead.  However, Im surprised to see it is as high as it is.p  pMy program needs to process huge amount of data stock market data with as low latency as possible.  Most of the calculations are fairly simple arithmetic operations.p  pI tried to test something very simple codeMath.random  Math.randomcodep  pThe simplest test runs this computation in a simple loop.  The second test does the same computation inside a anonymous Runnable this is supposed to measure the cost of creating new objects.  The third test passes the codeRunnablecode to an codeExecutorServicecode this measures the cost of introducing executors.p  pI ran the tests on my dinky laptop 2 cpus, 1.5 gig ramp  precodein milliseconds simpleCompuation47 computationWithObjCreation62 computationWithObjCreationAndExecutors422 codepre  pabout once out of four runs, the first two numbers end up being equalp  pNotice that executors take far, far more time than executing on a single thread.  The numbers were about the same for thread pool sizes between 1 and 8.p  pQuestion Am I missing something obvious or are these results expected  These results tell me that any task I pass in to an executor must do some nontrivial computation.  If I am processing millions of messages, and I need to perform very simple and cheap transformations on each message, I still may not be able to use executors...trying to spread computations across multiple CPUs might end up being costlier than just doing them in a single thread.

Negative 2433 h2Backgroundh2  pI have a custom authentication back end for our django applications that refers to an LDAP server.p  pAs soon as I authenticate someone, I have a wealth of information that our network infrastructure guys put in the LDAP server about the user  their last names which can change, for instance, if they marry, their emails which can also change, plus other company specific information that would be useful to transfer to the Django codeauthusercode table or profile table for local reference. p  pTo take advantage of this data, as of now, in our custom authenticate method Im looking up if it is an existing user logging in or creating a new if a new user that never logged in to our Django apps user, making any changes to it and saving it.p  pstrongThis smells bad to me.strong Authentication should be about saying yay or nay in granting access, not about collecting information about the user to store. I believe that should happen elsewhere p  pemBut I dont know where that elsewhere is...emp  pstrikeMy current implementation also causes a problem on the very first login of a user to one of our Django apps, becausep  ol liNew user to our apps logs in  coderequest.usercode now has a user with no codeuser.idcodeli liMy custom authenticate method saves the user information. Now the user exists in the DBli licodedjango.contrib.auth.logincode kicks in and retrieves the coderequest.usercode which still has no codeuser.idcode and no idea that authenticate saved the user and tries to save an update to last logged in date.li liSave fails because there is already a row in the database for that username unique constraint violationli ol  pYes, this only happens the very first time a user logs in the next time around it will be an update, coderequest.usercode will have a codeuser.idcode and everything is fine.strikep  pEdit Im investigating the strikedout area above. The login code clearly only uses the coderequest.usercode if the user is None which, coming out of the validation of the AuthenticationForm it shouldnt be. I probably am doing something wrong in my code...p  pstrongBut it still smells bad to have the authentication doing more than just, you know, authenticating...strongp  h2Questionh2  pWhat is the right place to plug in changes to the user instance during the login processp  pIdeally I would be able to, in my custom authenticate method, state that after login the information collected from a LDAP server should be written to the user instance and potentially the user profile instance.p  p  I do this local caching of the ldap information because I dont want to depend on it being up and running to let users log in to my systems if ldap is down, the last username and password in codeauthusercode are accepted.p

Negative 2433 pBack in my ASP.NET days, I used a hrefhttpurlrewriter.net relnofollowURLRewriter.NETa to do dynamic URL Rewrites.  Basically, its an HTTPModule that intercepts page requests and rewrites the URLs according to rules that you define, very similar to MODREWRITE.  However, it also lets you define a Custom Transform, a class with a single method that does URL translations for you onthefly.  You can have this method hit the DB, access the Application[] collection, pretty much do anything your heart desires.  p  pIs there any equivalent to this in the J2EE world  I want to be able to rewrite URLs dynamically and delegate this rewriting to some Java code.  I do NOT want to just set up a list of static rewrites.  Likewise, it needs to do actual URL masking, and NOT 3XX redirects.  p  pIf there isnt anything out there that does this, how would I go about building this functionality myselfp

Negative 2433 pI am working on a web application using ASP.NET 3.5.  The application has hundreds of tables. I was told in a seminar that I should use one .DBML file for the entire application instead of using multiple .DBML files there was also a post in stackoverflow that said the same thing.  Given that I have so many tables does using one .DBML file make sense or am I better off creating multiple .DBML files that are logically grouped  p  pFor instance,  I was thinking of creating the following .DBML files   p  ul liCustomerli liVendorli liEmployeeli liSales Orderli ul  pOne of the concerns that I have about using multiple .DBML files is how I would handle updates across .DBML files. For instance, if I had to update a field on the customer table when a new sales order was entered.  How would I handle that  I certainly dont want to include the customer table in both the Customer and the Sales Order .DBML files.  Could I wrap the operations in a TransactionScope    p  pI dont know if the following has any impact on the answer, but my plan is to use the repository pattern and POCO classes so that references to the table definitions in the .DBML file will be local to my data access layer.  p  pThanksp

I think I have it set up right, but it is not masking out the nonstenciled parts. Below is an extraction of code for what Im doing.p  precodegl.glEnableGL10.GLSTENCILTEST gl.glClearStencil0 gl.glClearGL10.GLSTENCILBUFFERBIT gl.glColorMaskfalse, false, false, false gl.glDepthMaskfalse gl.glStencilFuncGL10.GLALWAYS, 1, 1 gl.glStencilOpGL10.GLREPLACE, GL10.GLREPLACE, GL10.GLREPLACE  drawMask I have confirmed this draws to the correct location by allowing colour to show. Trust that this draws the mask to the correct location.  gl.glColorMasktrue, true, true, true gl.glDepthMasktrue gl.glStencilFuncGL10.GLEQUAL, 1, 1 gl.glStencilOpGL10.GLKEEP, GL10.GLKEEP, GL10.GLKEEP  drawItems Draw everything. Only items inside the masked area should be drawn. But everything is drawn with this code...  gl.glDisableGL10.GLSTENCILTEST codepre  pAnyone spot anything wrong with this What it does basically is draw a box for say, half the screen this works if I had colour enabled which is setting the stencil buffer to 1 for that area. And at the end I draw to the whole screen. I want it to draw to the top half only, but it draws everything.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2433 pI have a somewhat complex custom user control, created in C .NET, which is essentially a tree structure. The control , ctlGroup, contains a list of fields which are also custom user controls  ctlFields and a list of child groups. The datalist containing the child groups creates new instances of the same ctlGroup control, because each of the children can have a list of fields and a list of children, and so on. Whew.p  pThe number of children each group can have is finite, and each child group is an entry in a database, so infinite recursion is not possible. The controls are created fine, and displayed fine, until a postback occurs. I have been able to persist all the data pertaining to each dynamically created control pretty well on post back, with one exception. The part I am having trouble with is maintaining the visibility of certain panels on the controls through postback. Each child group has a button that expands and collapses part of the body. I can collapse this portion once, but as soon as I click the button again i.e. cause a postback, the control is persisted and its previous visibility setting is lost. p  pI seem to be struggling with coming up with a way to store this information. I tried saving the state of the visibility in the viewstate, but it seems this information does not carry over when the control is recreated. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas for how to do this Am I missing somethingp  pedit I should clarify that the ctlGroup controls that are created in the datalist are created dynamically because they are recursive calls. I dont know any other way to call a control from itself, but if t here is a better way, I would love to hear it.p

I have to strongquicklystrong create a simple WCF service and I have created all the classes I need decorated with the DataContract and DataMember attributes and I have created a custom exception class and everything is working.

Negative 2433 pGood dayp  pWhat difference between these librariesp  pI read MPIs docs and have small experience with asio. For me its different  implementations of network communication and no more.p  pBut each of them introduces different abstractions  Im not sure about same level  of these abstractions  which leads to different application design.p  pWhen I should use one library or another What I must to know for choosing right  decision in each separate situationp  pYes, Asio is good for several nodes and very generic framework in general, but why MPI is less better for such tasks I dont think that dependency on MPI C library is restrictive or MPI is hard to understand and what about scalability With Asio we can implement things like broadcasting and others and from another hand MPI doesnt forbid to write simple network applications. Is it conceptually difficult to rewrite Asiospecific logic with MPI if neededp  pWhat about socketlike communications if its mandatory, we can encapsulate such one in module on Asio or any other framework and still use MPI for other communications.p  pFor me sokets and MPI standart are different network services and its not clear what is fundamental in real world, where distance from simple clientserver pair to some medium computations is one step. Also I dont think that MPI has notable overhead in comparison with Asio.p  pMaybe its bad question and all we need its something like ICE Internet Communications Engine Different languages support and again as assures ZeroC great performance.p  pAnd, of course, I never seen in any documentation topic like dont use this library for it.p  pI simply cant take such disunity in one case its sockets, in another  asynchronous messages and finally heavy middleware platform. Where is clarity in lifecycle of development Maybe its not fair question, but for starting to reduce this zoo we need some point.p

Negative 2433 pCAAnimation provides the removedOnCompletion property which defaults to YES.p  pLets recognize these factsp  pA Core Animation only affects the Presentation Tree, but not the Model Tree. When an animation is done, you end up seeing whatever is set in the Model Tree. You can set a fillMode to kCAFillModeBoth for example, which will swap the value from the Presentation Tree over to the Model Tree once the animation is done. This causes your animation to not revert back which is most likely what you want.p  pB I did an experiment. removedOnCompletion  NO will emNOTem have the same effect as kCAFillModeBoth or kCAFillModeForwards. To be more precise It has absolutely no effect on how the result looks like when the animation is done. Wether it is removed or not, it seems to not affect the Presentation Tree at all.p  pTo explain what removedOnCompletion really does, the documentation is too weak in this regard. I dont get it. Can anyone explain what exactly would be removed, and whats the benefit of not having it removedp  pMy guess is that Apple is talking about the animator object itself, which is added to the layer with addAnimationforKey ... but again Whats the point of keeping it aroundp

However, I have seen an alternate method in a a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBapplicationsLCTDNNModDev.aspx relnofollowtutoriala which instead defines an codeltaspObjectDataSourcegtcode in the controller, and this seems to allow the Designer to do more intelligent things, such as add functioning Delete buttons through a checkbox.

Negative 2433 pIm building a website and my payment methods will be Google Checkout and Paypal. There will be linksbuttons which will redirect the user to the secure GooglePaypal sites for processing the payments. This means I do not need the 150year added expense and complexity of installing SSL certificates for my site.p  pHowever I would like to encrypt users passwords as they are logging in so that if they are on a network some malicious person running FireSheep etc cant read the users actual password as it is being sent to the server. The rest of the site doesnt need encryption as its not really sensitive data and would probably slow the user experience down significantly.p  pMy thoughts are this could be implemented with public key cryptography. Lets say the process goes something like thisp  ol liPublic key is in the JavaScript external file, private key in PHP on the serverli liUser enters their username and password into the form and clicks submitli liThe JavaScript runs and encrypts the password, storing it back in the text fieldli liForm is submitted to server and the password is decrypted with PHPli liPlain text password in PHP is salted amp hashed then compared to hash in database.li liPossible similar process for the registrationchange password functions.li ol  pIm thinking something like RSA would do the trick. But Ive hunted around the net for a working JavaScript library to do it but none seem to be compatible with the PHP libraries available. At any rate it needs to generate a set of keys that are compatible with the JavaScript and PHP.p  pAnyone know of an actual working solution for this If not how about we write one then open source it. Unfortunately writing encryptiondecryption code is pretty complex so I dont really know exactly what the existing libraries are doing and how to modify them to make it work. I already have protection for session fixationhijacking so Im not interested in that. Just interested in encrypting the data before it gets to the web server.p  pstrongNB Please dont post a bunch of links to standalone Javascript or PHP encryption libraries, Ive found those already on Google. Thats not actually useful. What I need is code for JavaScript encryption AND PHP decryption that actually works together harmoniously to produce the intended result outlined above.strongp  pstrongAlso if you could refrain from posting comments like just use SSL. Id actually like a solution to this exact problem even if its not best practice, it would be interesting none the less.strongp  pMany thanksp

This works great when running the TCPTestClient in a normal javaapplication The connection is established when calling connect and closed when calling close and the waiting readLine inside the InputHandler will fail because of a SocketException saying that the socket was closed codejava.net.SocketException Socket closedcode. This is the behaviour i expected.p  pBut when i run this code on Android, the conection will not be closed readLine still blocks without throwing a SocketException and the server does not show the client disconnectedmessage.p  pHere is my activityp  precodeimport java.io.IOException  import android.app.Activity import android.util.Log  public class Foo extends Activity      private TCPTestClient mClient      private static final String TAG  Foo      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.foo          mClient  new TCPTestClient192.168.1.2, 3456           Override     protected void onPause          super.onPause         Log.dTAG, onPause          try              mClient.close          catch IOException e              Log.dTAG, Disconnect failed, e                    Override     protected void onResume          super.onResume         Log.dTAG, onResume          try              mClient.connect          catch IOException e              Log.dTAG, Connect failed, e                codepre  pSo when the Activity is startedresumed, the connection will be established. And when the user clicks on the BackButton, the connection should be closed. However, onPause and close is called, but the socket is not closed because the BufferedReader still blocks waiting for Input. A call like codemReader.closecode inside the closemethod blocks, too.p  pDoes anyone know how to fix this issue so that the connection will be closed successfully when the Activity is pausedp

Negative 2433 pI converted a 100 ASP.NET driven form to using nearly all AJAX based architecture except that it doesnt submit the data using AJAX call, yet.  It does a full page postback.  And because the button submissions are still tied to so much functionality its a global button custom control with multiple buttons, I chose not to convert them over to AJAX yet.p  pEvery piece of data submits fine, except for one usecase.  Its a dropdown that is dependent from another dropdown.  strongSo now, when the value of dropdown 1 changes by the end user, dropdown 2 gets rebuilt from AJAX calls JavaScript.  Note, dropdown 1s options NEVER change in the life of the application.  When the form is submitted after that workflow, we lose the value of dropdown 2.strong  Hopefully this is making sense.  If dropdown 1 doesnt change, dropdown 2 still has the same options from when the form was built in the code behind, so the value in the viewstate can be found when its posted.p  pRight now, I have a hidden field to keep track of that value that was selected and works fine for now, but is a bit clumsy.  Before I did this development, both dropdowns had the AutoPostback attribute turned on.  That caused the form to get resubmitted without submitting the form, just so the dropdowns could get rebuilt.  p  pIs there a better approach to this problem without making the button perform an AJAX call to submit the datap

Negative 2433 pIm writing a vertical scrollable calendar applicationlistview that is always showing 1 month at a time. Whenever the user scrolls a certain amount of dip either up or down the I want the calendar to jump either to the next or previous monthdepending of the direction of the scroll.p  pI do the jump with the setSelection method. My problem is that for some reason setSelection calls getView twice. First it calls for position 0 then for position 1  always. So basically whenever I want to scroll to an adjacent month getView is called 3 times. First it is called because the list needs to show the topbottom of  the nextprevious month and after that  as I said  it is called twice because of setSelectionfor position 0 and position 1 always.p  pI have two problems with this. First I have a textview that keeps refreshing every time I scroll to a new month. I provide the data for this textview based on calculations I do in getView and since the getView is called 2 additional times with false datasfor position 0 and 1... in other words the very first and second month the calendar is capable showing my date textviews shows wrong date sometimes.to be more exact it shows the first month of the list whenever I scroll really fast instead of the actual monthp  pOf course I could solve this somehow e.g. I put a counter integer in the getView method or something like this but my other problem is that the calendar is a bit laggy. Instead of scrolling smoothly it needs about a second to load the next month whenever I start the scrolling motion. If somehow I could avoid setSelection thatd solve both of my problems. Ive tried using scrollBy but it doesnt generate the next month.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advancep

Negative 2433 pMy very first Q. on StackOverflowp  pI have a database originally generated using code first in Entity Framework 4.1.  Another team and the DBA have asked that we move to databasefirst design for a number of good reasons.  The database originally generated uses table per hierarchy inheritance in a variety of places.  We attempted to generate a model .edmx based on the preexisting database but the resulting model did not figure out the inheritance hierarchy this may be impossible.  p  pThe only solution we currently may have seems extremely time intensive  it appears we will need to create each inherited entity, set to abstract the base classestables in the model, delete every association to base classes and recreate them to the inherited classes.  Then validate the generated POCOs generated via ADO.NET DbContext Generator template against the emoriginalem POCOs used when we were using the codefirst approach.p  pThis will be very time intensive given the amount of inheritance utilized in our model and prior to investing this time, wed like to know if there is an easier way to get to a model that includes the inherited entities and appropriate associations  navigation properties.p  pThanks Matt p

Negative 2433 pIve spent a long time trying to work this out, but no success thus far.  Basically, there will be a JSON dataset coming via a jQuery GET or similar, which will differ in the number of columns and column names.  Datatypes will vary.  One time it may be NameBob, Age50 etc while next time it may be name, address, and occupation.p  pAll Id like to do is present that in a grid in my MVC view, which ideally provides some pagingsorting etc.  Column names should be derived from the labels in the JSON.  Im happy to pay for such a component if needed.p  pThats it  If I fail I guess Ill just have to render HTML and do without the other features.p  pThanksp  pPS.  The actual data will come from anonymous collections, generated by LINQ queries in the controller.  Binding to such a type would be the perfect solution if anyone knows how on demand paging would be great but no luck yet.  2 Days of getting the Telerik MVC grid to bind to an anonymous type or any conversion of it dynamics, tables, etc has been unsuccessful so far.  Ive added telerik MVC and Jqgrid as tags in case there are gurus monitoring those sections who know the answer.p

Negative 2433 pThis is related to a jsp web application..  Can I store object of some class as a context parameter and then write a listener for the context to initialize the object. How can I do this p
Negative 2433 pwe are developing a system that tracks the locations of several users. The users upload their locations at a server and then these locations are stored in a database. For now the database is MySQL. We want to make queries like tell me which users are at a specific square or circle or tell me which 5 users are closest to user Tom etc.p  pI have the basic knowledge of databases and MySQL but I am not specialized in databases, so as a first thought was to answer the above queries by using MySQL queries and some maths. With a small search I found that there are db systems like PostGIS that include many operations that we need. Especially for PostGIS there are many programs that use it as backend like Quantum GIS that we will be for me very convenient. p  pMy questions now Pp  pI read that PostGIS is an extension of PostgreSQL, that means that i can use at the same time PostgreSQL for manipulating other data e.g usernames, time etc and PostGIS to manipulate the users locations or I have to create two different databasesp  pMy deadline unfortunately is very tight... So it is easy to pass from MySQL to PostgreSQL or notp  pAny other ideas are welcomep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2433 pThis question might sound fool, because I know there are bunch of frameworks that does it for you. What I want is actually get in touch with low level C API deeply and able to write a program that sits on computer and intercepts packets between local machine and outer spaces.

Binding architecture tends to establish a tight copuling between xml structure and class structure. Good implementations like moxy let you loosen this coupling, but there are cases in wich the two structures simply dont match. In those cases, the DTO used to adapt them would be more work than using DOM. p

Negative 2433 pI have a large webs ervice API which is documented with XML documentation and parameter descriptions. The page which is automatically generated by the .asmx file which lists the methods and provides sample calling pages is just okay.p  pIs there a tool or platform where I can get a nicer and themed API page that clients can use to see the documentation and call the methods Ideally this would be something that takes my documentation xml file from visual studio in combination with the dll using reflection and a template and generates an attractive, professional and well documented site. Everything is in there with the dll and xml file, I just need it formatted nicely and automatically. I tried googling but couldnt find anything that accomplishes this. p

Negative 2433 pHow can the theoretical peak performance of 4 floating point operations double precision per cycle be achieved on a modern x8664 Intel cpup  pAs far as I understand it take 3 cycles for an sse codeaddcode and 5 cycles for a codemulcode to complete on most of the modern Intel cpus see e.g. a hrefhttpagner.orgoptimizeinstructiontables.pdfAgner Fogs Instruction Tablesa . Due to pipelining one can get a throughput of 1 codeaddcode per cycle if the algorithm has at least 3 independent summations. Since that is true for packed codeaddpdcode as well as the scalar codeaddsdcode versions and sse registers can contain 2 codedoublecodes the throughput can be as much as 2 flops per cycle. Furthermore it seems although Ive not seen any proper doc on this codeaddcodes and codemulcodes can be executed in parallel giving a theoretical max throughput of 4 flops per cycle.p  pHowever, Ive not been able to replicate that performance with a simple cc programme. My best attempt resulted in about 2.7 flopscycle.

Negative 2433 pIn my codebase I recently came across a design decision made by the team where keyvalue pairs are stored in a formatted manner within a databaseRelationalmysql column.

Negative 2433 pI am trying to fiddle a bit with ClojureScript, but it is more cumbersome than I would like.p  pI am able to get browserconnected REPL and interact with a live page. The problem is that I am not able to recover from exceptions. I often make typing mistakes which result in exceptions.

It happens that these functions contain mistakes, and when I load these modules I get other exceptions.p  pThe only thing I am able to do in this situation is stop everything with CtrlC. Which is painful, since before I can get anything done, I have to start the REPL again, which involves starting the JVM, something that is not exactly quick.p  blockquote   pIs there a way to recover from exceptions in the REPL without losing all the context so farp blockquote

Negative 2433 pim programming a system which records users achievements in games by collecting Trophy data which is uploaded to the system, it got it to work fine but i have started to think about one part of the system i can do in 2 different waysp  pthis part of the system gathers a Trophys rank Bronze, Silver, Gold, Crystal, Jade and how many points its worth, each user as a record in a games table, each field apart from the tables primary key and the userid foreign key represent each trophy that can be obtained in the exact order they are listed, this means they arent sorted in any way which a machine can easily search thoughp  phow i have combat this is that there is another table which each record contains the game and a string which lists the rank order of the trophies separated by s so when i use explodeSTRING, i get an array and each index of the array is a single character, it can look something like thisp  pbbsgcgsjp  pthat is just the trophy rank, the point value is done though function where i pass the game id and trophy id and a switch case statement will first check what game i have passed while nested switch cases in each case will check the id, in each case of these they return the point value of a trophyp  pnaturally i didnt plan out my code, the rank string above originally didnt have the  and i didnt do the point values like that cause unlike the rank, a score value van very between 1 and 3 digits, now i know i can do the same with the point value as i did with the rank orderp  pi want to know which method is more efficient for the web server and for browsers, pulling a string from a database and using explodeSTRING, and intval to convert the point values from strings to integers, need them like that for calculations or calling a function with switch case statement like a look up table or if what i already have is efficient enoughp  pim not really interested in trying to do what i am doing in a completely different way just to make it even more efficient as these methods perfectly fit the nested loops in which i am using them inp

Some are 32 wide and 64 tall, like a plant. p  pI am shipping them to the gpu just one .png at a time similar to the way that the XNA tutorials author does tile mapping.

Negative 2433 pSo I had a general question.  Often, while traversing different tree elements I find that the JQuery selector that I think I need ends up selecting something else, or much worse, it seems to select nothing.  p  pFor example sometimes using code.childcode or code.siblingcode it is easy to lose track of what is actually being selected.p  pSometimes I can use codealertcodes or a codeconsole.logcode to isolate the problem.  Sometimes though even that doesnt do the trick.  strongI was curious whether anyone knew of any good tricks to know what if anything the selector I am using has actually selected.strong  I dont know if there is any firebug tools, or something else that is useful.p  pAny suggestions  Thanks alot.p

Negative 2433 pSo I have this setup project in Wix and wanted to have a shortcut on the desktop. This must be easy you might think. But that is not the case. All the code snippets found on the Internet did not work. After a few hours of struggling and reading the documentation I finally got it right, so I am sharing it with you here.p
Negative 2433 pAs part of my plan to improve my programming skills, I have decided to attempt to sort a large array of strings lexicographically which later on I plan to do so using threading.  I have researched different sorting algorithms and I have tried to implement a Merge Sort my self from what I understood. For now I plan to sort a few simple strings.p  pI am inputting the following strings to be sorted in the below methodp  precode string[] stringsArray  new string[]  cixymn, adfxij, adxhxy, abcdef, iejfyq, uqbzxo, aaaaaa   string[] stringSorted  MergeSortstringsArray    For display purposes  foreach string s in stringSorted                      Console.WriteLineItem at index   Array.IndexOfstringSorted, s   is   s          codepre  pThe result I am getting is the followingp  precodeItem at index 0 is aaaaaa Item at index 1 is abcdef Item at index 2 is adfxij Item at index 3 is uqbzxo Item at index 4 is  Item at index 4 is  Item at index 4 is  codepre  pSince to implement the merge sort, you must first divide the array into two, I can easily understand that in this case, the left part is being sorted successfully whereas the right part is being ignored. I am under the impression that this is happening because I am comparing the characters of each string from the left side of the array in every recursion thus possibly ignoring the right.

I am running a program that needs to find cycles on a sparse graph 4v edges at maximum, and according to my calculations, I need v2 or better.

Negative 2433 pIm trying to create a perspective projection of an image based on the look direction. Im unexperienced on this field and cant manage to do that myself, however. Will you help me, pleasep  pThere is an image and an observer camera. If camera can be considered an object on an invisible sphere and the image a plane going through the middle of the sphere, then camera position can be expressed asp  blockquote   px  d cos cosp      py  d sinp      pz  d sin cosp blockquote  pWhere  is latitude,  is longitude and d is the distance radius from the middle of the sphere where the middle of the image is.p  pI found these formulae somwhere, but Im not sure about the coordinates I dont know but it looks to me that x should be z but I guess it depends on the coordinate system.p  pNow, what I need to do is make a proper transformation of my image so it looks as if viewed from the camera in a proper perspective. Would you be so kind to tell me a few words how this could be done What steps should I takep  pIm developing an iOS app and I thought I could use the following method from the QuartzCore. But I have no idea what angle I should pass to this method and how to derive the new x, y, z coordinates from the camera position. p  precodeCATransform3D CATransform3DRotate CATransform3D t, CGFloat angle,     CGFloat x, CGFloat y, CGFloat z codepre  pSo far I have successfully created a simple viewing perspective byp  blockquote   ol   liusing an identity matrix as the CATransform3D parameter with .m34 set to 11000,li   lirotating my image by the angle of  with the 0, 1, 0 vector,li   liconcatenating the result with a rotation by  and the 1, 0, 0 vector,li   liscaling based on the d is ignored I scale the image based on some other criteria.li   ol blockquote  pBut the result I got was not what I wanted which was obvious . The perspective looks realistic as long as one of these two angles is close to 0. Therefore I thought there could be a way to calculate somehow a proper angle and the x, y and z coordinates to achieve a proper transformation which might be wrong because its just my guess.p

Negative 2433 pHaving just finished the first part of my schooling Im looking for work. I went to an interview for a C.net developer. During the interview I was asked to create a class with two properties. Then in a asp.net form create an object from that class. So I created a class with a constructor that took two strings, setting the properties of the object. In the asp.net page I added two text boxes and a button. In the buttons click method I put in the line codeClass whatever  new Classtextbox1.text, textbox2.textcode p  pSo after I finish I look at the gentlemen that are interviewing me and wonder why they are looking at me like Im crazy. So I ask, You dont think that will work They replied, Run it and well see. Ok, so I ran the program, entered some text into the text boxes and clicked the button. Guess what, nothing happened lol. At which point I said, If you want, I can output the object to some labels or something if you want. They said as they were looking at me like Ive done something wrong, No, just put a break point on this line and run the program again. So we run the program again, the break point shows that the object was created with the text. Then I hear Hmmm, that worked. At which point I tuned to them and said, Are you guys messing with me or did you really think that that wouldnt work They replied that what I was was just a really old way to create an object.

Negative 2433 pWithin a a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgguidedirectiveAttributes relnofollowdirective definitiona, theres an API for accessing element and attrs, so you can refer back to the element from which the directive was called. How would I access element and attrs when calling a custom function using a standard directive like ngclassp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong I understand that this is not an idiomatic approach. This question is applicable to rapid prototypes, which is a great use for many of Angulars features. Just not the ones that are all about sustainability, separation of concerns, etc. My primary concern is velocity. Thus, being able to bang something out quickly with the builtin directives and a quick controller method can, in fact, be a virtue, and can win the opportunity to do a fuller and more proper implementation down the road...p  hr  pIn this case, Im just adding a contextual code.activecode class to a nav element, based on the value of codelocation.pathcode, as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12592472howtohighlightacurrentmenuiteminangularjsthis posta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12592472howtohighlightacurrentmenuiteminangularjsthis onea. However, in those examples you need to explicitly and redundantly pass a copy of the contents of the codehrefcode attribute as an argument to the codegetClasscode function youre calling from codengclasscode. But isnt there a way to programmatically access the codehrefcode attribute from within codegetClasscode and avoid redundantly passing identical content as an argp  pFor example, a controller with a codegetClasscode function the way Id imagine it could workp  precodefunction navCtrlscope, routeParams      scope.getClass  functionelement, attrs          if location.path.substr0, path.length  attrs.href              return active          else              return                 codepre  pWhich you could then call simply and elegantly withp  precodelta ngclassgetClass hreftasksgtTasksltagt codepre  prather thanp  precodelta ngclassgetClasstasks hreftasksgtTasksltagt codepre  pI recognize another option is to create a custom directive that does this, but for now Id just like to figure out if its possible to access attrs andor element from within a controller function thats been called by a directive.

Negative 2433 pI am facing a strange problem. p  pI am trying to access a server from Samsung Galaxy Nexus.

Negative 2433 pI love the effect that the initial smoothHeight has when the page loads. I hate the way it slowly reacts to a page resizing after the initial load. I would love to keep the effect for the initial page load, and then fall back to the default resizing without animation. I have been chasing this for hours. By setting the smoothHeight variable back to false at the end of the smoothHeight function itself I can switch the variable back to false after the initial animation, but this disables any resizing of the height after the initial load.  This feels like a very simple operation, but I cant figure it out. Thanks ahead of time for any ideasp  pBasically, when this block is executed once, it sets the height so that, even once the variable is changed back to false, the height is no longer flexible.p  pcodesmoothHeight functiondur          if vertical  fade            var obj  fade  slider  slider.viewport           dur  obj.animateheight slider.slides.eqslider.animatingTo.height, dur  obj.heightslider.slides.eqslider.animatingTo.height                codep
Negative 2433 pWhen I build an EC2 instance m1.small for example, by deafult I get 30gb instead of 160gb.p  pIve seen in google that I need to add ephemeral storage  instance stored storage.. To my question Is there a way to add the ephemeral storage using the java sdk If I create an instance using the sdk with a standard volume of 160gb, I get charged as if I was creating a regular instance and attached a new volume to itp  pAnd more generally, so when they write that an instance has 160gb,  that means I only have 30gb and another 140gb that I should only use for temporary files which i dont mind to losep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2433 pMy Android app uses a WebView to display a bunch of HTML code that I generate on the fly.

Note that Im not loading an actual HTML file, Im merely creating a string that represents some hopefully valid HTML and load it in the WebView. p  pAnyway, the HTML I generate the part in the getThreadBody method contains named anchors, for example like thisp    precodeltdivgt     lta name949823gtAnchor 1ltagt     ltdivgtAll kinds of stuffltdivgt      lta name895984gtAnchor 2ltagt     ltdivgt...ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNow in some cases I want the WebView to navigate to one of those anchors as soon as I load the HTML. As far as I understand the WebView supports navigating scrolling in this case to named anchors, but the catch is that nobody is clicking any hyperlinks to those anchors, I want the WebView to scroll when it is loaded it is no problem if there is a short delay between loading the HTML and scrolling, my point is that it should not require user interaction.p  pI believe the behavior can be achieved by using the WebViews loadUrl method and supplying a URL with the anchor in place, egp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodewebview.loadUrlfileandroidassetpage.html895984, ... codepre  pHowever, since I am not saving the HTML to any file I cannot use this method...

Negative 2433 pI have this situationp  pIm using Nhibernate to map an Entity strongUserstrong that is mapped on a large table in Sql, for perfomance reasons Ive created a lightweight entity strongLightweightUserstrong that has only a small set of properties and is strongNOTstrong mapped in a hbm file or whatever, Im using the strongNhibernate Projectionstrong technique to wire the strongLightweightUserstrong entity. Both entities are deriving from a simple class Entity that contains an Id property.p  pThe above implementations works fine, sql query is smaller  faster.p  pBut in my Nhibernate SessionFactory I have also injected a strongNhibernate Intercerptorstrong.  The strongOnLoadstrong method of the Interceptor is called when Im getting a strongUserstrong entity from the NHibernate Dao, but when I get the strongLightweightUserstrong entity from the NHibernate Dao the Interceptor is strongnot triggeredstrong OnLoad method.p  pThis is probably related to the fact that NHibernate SessionFactory has no knowledge of my LightweightUser entity.

The are named, for now, codeSimpleProtocolcode, codeParallelProtocolcode. I wanted to persist those object so I used JSON.NET and everything works fine. Except when I am trying to deserialize them it works perfectly when I know the type they are supposed to be, for instancep  precodeSimpleProtocol p  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltSimpleProtocolgtmyJsonData codepre  pHowever, I am now in a situation where I want to load the JSON data and get an codeIProtocolcode back, but that is, understandably, not allowed by JSON E.g., something like this does strongnotstrong workp  precodeIProtocol p1  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltIProtocolgtmyJsonData  does not work IProtocol p2  IProtocolJsonConvert.DeserializeObjectmyJsonData  also, does not work codepre  pSo, looking up the a hrefhttpjames.newtonking.comprojectsjsonhelpindex.htmltopichtmlOverloadNewtonsoftJsonJsonConvertDeserializeObject.htm relnofollowAPIa I found this method signaturep  precodepublic static Object DeserializeObject     string value,     Type type  codepre  pwhich looks just like the thing I needed, so trying out by also persisting the type in a string and retrieving itp  precode test Type protocolType  Type.GetTypeMyApp.Protocols.SimpleProtocol IProtocol p1  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectmyJsonData, protocolType codepre  pI get an error that it is impossible to cast a codeNewtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObjectcode to codeIProtocolcode. This is weird and I dont know how to solve this.p  pIt is impossible to pass the Type object in a generic method, so I am basically stuck here. Is there a method to solve this, preferably without using Reflection It looks to me that this is a perfectly normal use case.p  pWhat I can do, but it seems a bit dirty to me, is to create a simple wrapper class which holds an IProtocol instance in it and serialize  deserialize thatp

Negative 2433 pI have setup a network monitoring system at my office that monitors activity over my network and shoots me an email at certain triggers that i have setup. I have put together an application that quickly does the job for me custom made for the kind of monitoring that i need and rules that i have setup. Now everything is fine and i have setup the emails to be sent using gmail smtp using swift mail plugin. p  pThe problem is gmail is locking my gmail account if a burst of emails is sent or atleast that is what i think. What happens is sometimes theres a lot of activity and the system sends like 50 or 60 emails over a short span of time like in a minute or two. Immediately gmail blocks access to the account and when i open the account in my browser it asks to verify my account. Even after unblocking it the server is still not able to open to gmail account using smtp or imap. p  pThis is getting annoying and i would like to know if there is a way to stop gmail from blocking access to an account if it knows that the access is from a specific IP or if there is a better way to send lots of emails. p

Negative 2433 pSolution Foundp  pProblem description I was using an old C library and had a class that was receiving a const char  as an argument in a function. The function was creating a dynamic object and storing it in a linked list using the const char  as an argument.p  pThe problem was that after doing so, the const char  that was passed to the function was modified in memory outside of the class. This destroyed the data in the Node.p  pThe Solution Use stdstring as the data types in the Classes. When the const char  is passed to the string as a value the string takes care of the memory management for you.p  pWhat I learned When using C always use Strings and ONLY use char  with a string.cstr if it is needed in some C library.p  pThanks guys. You saved my weekend. p
Negative 2433 pI am designing a SDL game  where the playerhuman can place  nets on a NM grid such that each net covers a single element of the grid only There are NM elementscells on the grid. Now in each round of the game the game currently has 10 rounds ,the player can place nets on the grid by purchasing nets with each net costing NetCost which is subtracted from the players score in order to catch balls falling. Also the player can move move the nets at start of any round to a cellelement sharing an edge ie up,down,left,right. Now balls fall in each round each round is instantaneous theoritically although in the visuals of the game it lastss  2 seconds The playerss nets catch these balls such that a net placed at  a cell catches all balls that fell at that particular cell. For each ball missed there is a penalty on the score B. The player starts with a fixed score. The computer player and human player play the same round separately such that choices made by human player dont affect computer player and vice versa.br Now I have to design an efficient computer player for single player mode .The computer player will also start from the same score as the human player. The purpose of the computer player is to get maximum score possible on the same grid using the same nets available to the  user. These inputs to the computer player  will be the balls falling in each round R at the starting of the round R along with their grid location. How can I design an efficient computer player for this game p  pNote the grid size is constant for each round and is 30x30. The starting score is fixed at 100,000 for both players.However net cost and the ball drop penalty maybe chosen by the user at the start of the game ie before round 1 .These costs remain constant for all the rounds The number of nets may be limited to lets say 200 for each round. I am not sure what algorithm I can apply here. Can someone please guide me in the right direction p

Negative 2433 pstrongFirst questionstrongp  pSuppose I need to launch a kernel with 229080 threads on a Tesla C1060 which has compute capability 1.3.p  pSo according to the documentation this machine has 240 cores with 8 cores on each symmetric multiprocessor for a total of 30 SMs.p  pI can use up to 1024 per SM for a total of 30720 threads running concurrently.p  pNow if I define blocks of 256 threads that means I can have 4 blocks for each SM because 10242564. So those 30720 threads can be arranged in 120 blocks across all SMs.p  pNow for my example of 229080 threads I would need 229080256895 rounded up blocks to process all the threads.p  pNow lets say I want to call a kernel and I must use those 229080 threads so I have two options. The first one is to I divide the problem so that I call the kernel 8 times in a for loop with a Grid of 120 blocks and 30720 threads each time 22908030720. That way I make sure the device will stay occupied completely. The other option is to call the kernel with a Grid of 895 blocks for the entire 229080 threads on which case many blocks will remain idle until a SM finishes with the 8 blocks it has.p  pSo which is the preferred option does it make any difference for those blocks to remain idle waiting do they take resourcesp  pstrongSecond questionstrongp  pLets say that within the kernel Im calling I need to access non coalesced global memory so an option is to use shared memory.p  pI can then use each thread to extract a value from an array on global memory say codeglobalarraycode which is of length 229080. Now as I understand correctly you have to avoid branching when copying to shared memory since all threads on a block need to reach the codesyncthreadscode call to make sure they all can access the shared memory.p  pThe problem here is that for the 229080 threads I need exactly 229080256894.84375 blocks because there is a residue of 216 threads. I can round up that number and get 895 blocks and the last block will just use 216 threads.p  pBut since I need to extract the value to shared memory from codeglobalarraycode which is of length 229080 and I cant use a conditional statement to prevent the last 40 threads 256216 from accessing illegal addresses on codeglobalarraycode then how can I circumvent this problem while working with shared memory loadingp

Negative 2433 pWe have a smallish, 40k rows, thus far transactional table with an index enabled on a single column. This index is extremely valuable to us as the reads to the table tend to be quite frequent.p  pAt certain times, multiple bulk insert statements are performed on this transactional table, quite often 100s of mini bulk inserts lt 50 rows in say an hour or two. Then it might lie idle for a while. Whilst each individual insert tends to work quite well, these concurrent INSERT statements tend to break i.e. fail after a while and wont work unless we restart the instance.p  pIs this because of the index How can we work around that limitation Is cursor.executemany preferable over cursor.execute in this case Would sending these INSERT queries to a task queue make a difference p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Elements are not deleted over the 24 period, just new elements keep getting inserted.p  pThen at end of period the set is cleared, and new elements start getting added again for another 24 hours.p  pDo you think a fast pool allocator would be useful here as to reuse the memory and possibly help with fragmentationp  pThe set grows to around 1 million elements.

Negative 2433 pHere is the problem I want to place a view with dynamic height which will be calculated at runtime according to the width lets call it center view between two views. The tricky part is that the top and bottom views should adapt their height to fit the space left after center view measurement and layout, and their height shouldnt be less that minHeight. I managed to put all three views in vertical linear layout, where top and bottom have weight  1 and center view is some fixed height, but when the center view height is becomes bigger than some value it covers top and bottom views and their minHeight param is ignored.

Negative 2433 pI have a ComboBox that has an ItemSource bound to a an ObservableCollection and its SelectedItem property is bound to a property of T.  Both properties live on my view model.  Everything works great except for one issue that is causing me to tear my hair out.  When I set a property on the object bound to the SelectedItem, the ComboBox binding stops working.  VS 2012 output window does not report any binding errors and no exceptions are thrown.p  pXAMLp  precodeltComboBox ItemSourceBinding PathConnections, ModeOneWay           SelectedItemBinding PathSelectedConnection, ModeTwoWay           DisplayMemberPathNamegt ltTextBlock TextBinding PathConnectionName, ModeTwoWay gt ltTextBlock TextBinding PathConnectionGroup, ModeTwoWay gt codepre  pView Modelp  precodeprivate void SaveChanges       this.SelectedConnection.Name  this.ConnectionName     this.SelectedConnection.Group  this.ConnectionGroup        Save the changes  codepre  pNow all of that works just fine.  But as soon as SaveChanges completes the ComboBox starts acting funny.  It looks like everything is fine, but if you attempt to change the selection nothing happens the same item is selected and the setter for SelectedConnection does not fire.  I tried systematically commenting out code in SaveChanges and if I leave only a single line that is setting any property on SelectedConnection I see this failure happen.p  pI also added an event handler in the code behind of the control to handle the SelectionChanged event on the ComboBox.  After the break happens, any time I try to change the value via the UI or in Code the event handler fires twice in immediate succession.  The first has the event args AddedItems set with a single value which is the value I just selected and would expect.  However the event fires again immediately with only a single item in the RemovedItems collection of the event args.  That collection also contains the item I just selected.p  pI have tried setting the SelectedConnection property to null and then after the method finishes, setting back to the object in question.  No luck.p  pI also saw an old bug post about moving the ItemSource property after the SelectedItem property on my XAML mark up but that had no effect either.p  pIm trying to avoid creating a shadow list and trying to keep everything in sync as that was going to be my next try but that is just getting ugly to do something so simple.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. p  pIf it matters, this is Visual Studio 2012 building to the 4.5 framework.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve now also tried just completely removing the modified object from the ObservableCollection after setting its properties.  It still shows as if it was the selected value its name is immediately visible in the ComboBox but it no longer shows up in the drop down list.  It also will still not allow itself to be unselected even though it doesnt exist in ItemSource any more.p  p UPDATE p  pI changed the method in question to completely null out the ObservableCollection that is bound to the ItemSource and then restore it once the process is over with like sop  precodeprivate void SaveChanges      var selected  this.SelectedConnection      var name  this.ConnectionName   bound to fields on the view     var group  this.ConnectionGroup      this.Connections  null     this.RaisePropertyChangedConnections   SelectionChanged fires as expected      selected.Name  name     selected.Group  group      this.repository.SaveChanges      this.Connections  new ObservableCollectionltConnectiongtthis.repository.AllConnections     this.RaisePropertyChangedConnections   SelectionChanged event doesnt fire     this.SelectedConnection  selected    SelectionChanged event doesnt fire  codepre  pAfter that is done the ComboBox once again allows me to change the value as you would expect.  However the selected item does not actually appear as selected even though it is correctly set in the View Model.  So yeah, its a really ugly workaround and it creates its own issue as well.p

Negative 2433 pI have a task to see if an algorithm I developed can be ran faster using computing on GPU rather than CPU. Im new to computing on accelerators, I was given a book C AMP which Ive read thoroughly, and I thought I understood it reasonably well I coded in C and C in the past but nowadays its mostly C.p  pHowever, when going into real application, I seem to just not get it. So please, help me if you can.p  pLets say I have a task to compute some complicated function that takes a huge matrix input like 50000 x 50000 and some other data and outputs matrix of same size. Total calculation for the whole matrix takes several hours. p  pOn CPU, Id just cut tasks into several pieces number of pieces being something like 100 or so and execute them using Parralel.For or just a simple task managing loop I wrote myself. Basically, keep several threads running num of threads  num of cores, start new part when thread finishes, until all parts are done. And it worked well p  pHowever, on GPU, I cannot use the same approach, not only because of memory constraints thats ok, can partition into several parts but because of the fact that if something runs for over 2 seconds its considered a timeout and GPU gets reset So, I must ensure that every part of my calculation takes less than 2 seconds to run. p  pBut thats not every task like, partition a hourlong work into 60 tasks of 1sec each, which would be easy enough, thats every bunch of tasks, because no matter what queue mode I choose immediate or automatic, if I run via parralelforeach anything that takes in total more than 2s to execute, GPU will get reset.p  pNot only that, but if my CPU program hogs all CPU resource, as long as it is kept in lower priority, UI stays interactive  system is responsive, however, when executing code on GPU, it seems that screen is frozen until execution is finished p  pSo, what do I do In the demonstrations to the book NBody problem, it shows that it is supposed to be like 100x as effective multicore calculations give 2 gflops, or we amount of flops that was, while amp give 200 gflops, but in real application, I just dont see how to do it p  pDo I have to partition my big task into like, into billions of pieces, like, partition into pieces that each take 10ms to execute and run 100 of them in parralelforeach at a timep  pOr am I just doing it wrong, and there is a better solution I just dont getp  pHelp pleasep

Negative 2433 pI have been tasked with creating a sort of global error handling solution, so Im creating an codeHttpModulecode to be dropped into an existing ASP.NET solution.  Sometimes these existing web apps will have their own error handling trycatch that might do something specific.  p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong When an app encounters an exception, does the codeOnErrorcode in my codeHttpModulecode fire last since it has more of a global scope than a specific trycatch inside the app  Will it fire last every single time  Will codeOnErrorcode catch every single application exception, handled AND unhandled  When I say handled I mean if an error is already handled in some section of my code somewhere in my app, will it wind up in codeOnErrorcodep

I have it in the form of a libFoo.a file.p  pId like to extract the classes and methods that are contained within the library, similar to the output of classdumpz.p  pIve tried using codeotool tVcode as suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2334072decompilingobjectiveclibraries titleSO question Decompiling ObjectiveC librariesherea.p  pHowever, the output is very verbose and includes lots of things other than just the interface declarations.p  pPer comment from H2CO3, I tried RuntimeBrowser, which seems like an excellent tool. However, opening the .a files from File  Open didnt seem to do anything. Could be because I was using the Mac version and trying to inspect an iOS library.p  pIve also tried running classdumpz against the static library but it doesnt appear to workp  precode   This header is generated by classdumpz 0.2a.   classdumpz is Copyright C 2009 by KennyTM, licensed under GPLv3.     Source null   codepre  pTried regular classdump but got this error messagep  blockquote   pError Fat file doesnt contain a valid MachO file for the specified   architecture i386.  It probably means that classdump was run on a   static library, which is not supported.p blockquote  pI downloaded the evaluation version of IDA for Mac 6.4.1303322 and so far its been the best yet. Very usefuljust pop open the static library and you can see a list of the classes and it understands ObjectiveC 2.0 syntax and you can see the methods.p  pThat being said, Id still love to see a way to get the output in the same format as classdumpz.p  pAnyone know of a way to extract the classes and methods that are contained in an objectivec static library I can see them in the stack when I stop in the debugger and when I use code[NSThread callStackSymbols]code so I know the debugging symbols are present.p

That part is working fantastic. p  pHeres where I have a problem, Instagram only provide their videos as .mp4 which doesnt work in all versions of Firefox lt21. After a fair bit of investigation on the Mozilla blog it appears that mp4 isnt supported due to patenting issues, and it looks like its going to stay that way.p  pJust to make it clear that resavingencoding the videos as .oggwebm isnt practical as Im purely relying on Instagram hosting the videos and then providing the source url to the video.p  pSo I require a fallback. Can a flash player be used to play mp4 videos I tend to steer well clear of Flash so Im very unfamiliar with it. p

Negative 2433 pI am trying to use ajax to compare two arrays to see if a particular value set is  the same or not, so I filled both arrays with the same values and when i tested them  my test says that they are not the same.  The first array was made on fileA.php with a while loop pulling directly from a databaseand uses ajax to send it as a url variable to fileB.php the responding file. On fileB.php I then use a GET to get the array , and create another array with a while loop pulling the exact same values directly from the database and compare the two . At this point the two arrays should be the same, but as I said earlier my test says they arent .So I did a vardump of both arrays and they looked different for some reason.p  pfirst array dumpp  precode    array2    [0]gt   array0       [1]gt    string6     ,2,2,1   codepre  psecond array dumpp  precodearray3   [0]gt  array0     [1]gt  string1 2   [2]gt   string1 2   [3]gt   string1 1   codepre  parray 1 is made on fileA.phpp  precode      while row  mysqlfetchassocres        iState[]  row[state]  end while codepre  pthen i use ajax to send to fileB.phpp  precode   jsarraylt echo jsonencodeiState gt     var urljsarrayjsarray.join,      xmlhttp.openGET,fileB.phpistate urljsarray,true xmlhttp.send codepre  pthen in fileB.phpajax response file i retrieve the arrayp  precode    iStateValues[] GET[istate]  codepre  pthen I create array 2 on fileB.phpp  precode     while row  mysqlfetcharrayres           currentiState[] row[state]        end while codepre  pthen I compred the twop  precode   echonnsame testn    ifiStateValuescurrentiState    echo same    else    echo not same codepre  pThe vardumps of the two arrays are different but they were created the exact same way .

Negative 2433 pI like tables since text align is pretty nice there. If we have a text inside a codelttdgtcode like codelttdgtSample Textlttdgtcode, it doesnt matter how much height the cell have, the text will be vertically aligned on center. The text will be automatically re aligned if there is less space in the cell for the text to accommodate. But, if I have a span inside the td, having the same height of codetdcode, the text will be aligned on top. I can give a fixed padding inside span for the text to align vertically, but then at the time of resizing, it wont pull the text upward inside the cell, leaving a permanent top padding.p  pWhat I want is to make the text behave inside a span which is inside a td, to behave exactly as it is inside a codetdcode.

How would I be able to break the event loop after a specified idle time I do type codejjcode once in a blue moon, and Id still like the flexibility of a timeout.p  pIs there any other way which I am unaware of to achieve what I want p  pEDITp  pOrigionally, this question was about the minibuffer in general. codekeychord.elcode seems to work fine with codeminibufferlocalmapcode. It does not, however, work with codeisearchmodemapcode. Binding a command to a single regular key like codejcode does work in isearch. This is what Im trying to solve.p

Negative 2433 pI wanted to read a file and process each line of the file. I have used the readStream to read the file and then invoke the processRecord method. The processMethod need to make multiple calls and need to make the final data before its written to the store. p  pThe file has 500K records. p  pThe issue that Im facing is that, the files are read at a significant pace and I believe the node is not getting enough priority to actually process the processLine method. Hence the memory shoots upto 800MB and then slows down. p  pAny help is appreciated. p  pThe code that Im using is given below  p  precodevar instream  fs.createReadStreamCdata.txt var outstream  new stream  var rl  readline.createInterface     input instream,         output outstream,         terminal false  outstream.readable  true  rl.online, functionline    processRecordline         codepre

Negative 2433 pFrom the FluentValidation a hrefhttpsfluentvalidation.codeplex.comwikipagetitleCustomising relnofollowdocumentationa I learned that I can abort validation by setting the cascade mode.p  precodeRuleForx gt x.Surname .CascadeCascadeMode.StopOnFirstFailure .NotNull .NotEqualfoo codepre  pThat way if the property strongSurnamestrong is null, the equality check wont be executed and a null pointer exception prevented.

Negative 2433 pI am running a MapReduce job in Hadoop. My reducer function for simplicity outputs the key, and count of the keys occurrence. p  pThe next step in my pipeline is to send this data to a MySQL databasespecifically an RDS instance, but I have run into issues with the reducers trying to access the jdbc driver. This is probably because the driver is not being sent to all the reducers and is only packaged in my jar. p  pFor this program I believe instead of trying to debug the reducer, it will be easier to right another program that simply cats the data from hdfs and sends line after line to the database. p  pDoes having each Reducer connecting to the database improve the process through the parallelization I expect In which case, is it worth spending the time to wrestle with the Reducers jdbc driverp  pSample Output hdfsuserhadoopoutpartr0000p  precodeKey1     150 Key2     214 codepre

Negative 2433 pMy board has a Cavium Octeon NPU, running Linux kernel 2.6.34.10 that acts as a PCIe Root Complex. It is connected to PCIe switch, as are some other peripheral devices Endpoints, among which there is Marvells 9143 PCItoSATA controller based SSD. p  pWhen PCIe is initially enumerated, PCI driver on Octeon adds up the sizes of all the prefetchable memory resources and programs the PLIMIT and PBASE registers on the upstream switch port accordingly. In my case that address range is 0x80000000  0xEFFFFFFF.p  pAfter that, I would expect that address range to be inaccessible to kernel memory manager allocating for DMA buffers etc. And yet, I see the kernel, at some point starts sending SCSI requests to the SSD device, where scattergather list elements fall within this address range. I confirmed this, by looking at PCI analyzer trace. Naturally, when SSD controller receives such an address, it tries to access it DMA read or write, and fails, because upstream switch port refuses to forward this request upstream to Root Complex, because it is programmed to think that this address would be downstream from it. Interestingly enough, it mostly happens when I manipulate large files, I see that kernel allocated buffer addresses grow downward, until they dip below 0xEFFFFFFFp  pHence, the question shouldnt PCI enumerationrescan code, tell the kernel  these are PCI devices register addresses and therefore are offlimit for DMA buffer allocation Or is it responsibility of each individual device driver to reserve its prefetchable memory Marvell driver I use reserves regular memory BAR, but not the prefetcheable one. Is that a problemp  pThanks in advance and apologies for lengthy description.p

However, I am inheriting from a purely virtual class Animal which requires me to define the function with the Animal parameter.p  pI know that having a parameter as Animal causes the function DogEat to think that the parameter is an Animal and not a Dog. However, considering that the data for the object to be represented as a Dog is still emthereem I am pretty sure that there is a way to establish cast, etc the Animal as a Dog, I just dont know how and I am not quite sure how to search.p  pSo I am wondering how I would do this. I am pretty sure that you can use a dynamic cast or a reinterpret cast, but I am under the impression that you typically want to minimize the use of these casts emif you canem. I am pretty new to Object Oriented within C since I used to mainly use only C.p

Negative 2433 pI am looking for a good portable technology that would allow for unified way to package software that runs on five different platforms. The platforms are Solaris10SPARC, Solaris10X86, Solaris11SPARC, Solaris11X86, and RHEL6.4X86. About 95 of the software is portable Java applications but there a small amount of middleware that is platformspecific. Instead of building five different distributable images that are 95 identical one for every platform, I want to produce a single universal image for all five. If I follow this route, it makes sense to unify the packaging format to have identical look and feel to the installation process and to keep everything neatly arranged in the distributable image. Oh, and different software components in the image are individual packages, much like a distro comprised of a bunch of RPMs.p  pIn a search for a portable packaging mechanism I looked at RPM, which is a pain to build for Solaris and I need four different builds. I also read up on dpkg and a few other exotic packaging and installation suites. None of them seems to be as portable as I would like it to be. I wish there was a Python version of RPM that does not require anything but Python interpreter, but I could not find anything of this kind.p  pI would really appreciate any hints as to what existing freeware and portable packaging and installation solutions there are. I can always design and build my own but I would rather rely on somebody else who went this route before me.p  pThank youp

Negative 2433 pI have written a Console application that makes an HTTP POST to a ASMX Web Service within Sharepoint that I am looking to invoke remotely with WinRM. I have written a PowerShell process that bundles up the built application, moves it to the destination server, and executes it locally. The process works completely fine ie moving copying, whathaveyou, but fails when it gets to the Web Service call. Looking at logs on Fiddler, the HTTP Post request has no credentials in it at all, even though the application is being ran with an account that has all the proper permissions. p  pSince the application is moved to the destination server locally, I can run it locally, which I have done, and it works completely fine, as the Fiddler logs show the correct credentials in the header.p  pI am not sure where the issue resides, but I am having a hard time thinking its my code, since it works fine when ran locally. It may be  with the WinRM process, but the exact same process works for other environments this project is part of a larger deployment solution that deploys databases, ssis packages , etc.p  pI am happy to provide code of certain pieces if needed, and any basic troubleshooting advice would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe user credentials I specify in a xml file that contains the username and a hashed password, like this in Powershellp  precode powershell.exe version 3.0 ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned command amp  credImportClixml CREDENTIALFILENAME  cred.PasswordConvertToSecureString cred.Password  CredentialNewObject System.Management.Automation.PsCredentialcred.UserName, cred.Password  invokecommand computername MACHINE filepath Result Credential Credential  codepre

Negative 2433 pThe question arose while I was researching the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25385464howistheimplicittypeconversionprioritydeterminedthis SO questiona. Consider the following codep  precodestruct A     operator char const return a      operator int const return 10    struct B      void operatorltlt int     int main      A a     B b     b ltlt a  codepre  pThe conversion of codeacode to codeintcode can be either via codea.operator charcode followed by an integral promotion, or codea.operator intcode followed by an identity conversion i.e., no conversion at all. The standard says that 13.3.3.1 [over.best.ics]p10, footnote omitted, bolding mine all quotes are from N3936p  blockquote   pIf several different sequences of conversions exist that each convert   the argument to the parameter type, the implicit conversion sequence   associated with the parameter is defined to be the unique conversion   sequence designated the emambiguous conversion sequenceem. For the   purpose of ranking implicit conversion sequences as described in   13.3.3.2, the ambiguous conversion sequence is treated as a userdefined sequence that is indistinguishable from any other   userdefined conversion sequence. strongIf a function that uses the   ambiguous conversion sequence is selected as the best viable function,   the call will be illformed because the conversion of one of the   arguments in the call is ambiguous.strongp blockquote  pHere, codeBoperatorltltintcode is the only viable candidate  and hence is the best viable candidate, even though the conversion sequence for the parameter is the emambiguous conversion sequenceem. According to the bolded sentence, then, the call should be illformed because the conversion of one of the arguments in the call is ambiguous. p  pYet no compiler that I tested g, clang, and MSVC actually reports an error, which makes sense because after the function to call is selected through overload resolution, the functions parameter 8.3.5 shall be initialized 8.5, 12.8, 12.1 with its corresponding argument 5.2.2 [expr.call]p4. This initialization is emcopyinitializationem 8.5 [dcl.init]p15, and according to 8.5 [dcl.init]p17, results in a new round of overload resolution to determine the conversion function to usep  blockquote   pThe semantics of initializers are as follows. The emdestination typeem   is the type of the object or reference being initialized and the   emsource typeem is the type of the initializer expression. If the initializer is not a single possibly parenthesized expression, the   source type is not defined.p      ul   li[...]li   liIf the destination type is a possibly cvqualified class type [...]li   liOtherwise, if the source type is a possibly cvqualified class type, conversion functions are considered. The applicable conversion   functions are enumerated 13.3.1.5, and the best one is chosen   through overload resolution 13.3. The userdefined conversion so   selected is called to convert the initializer expression into the   object being initialized. If the conversion cannot be done or is   ambiguous, the initialization is illformed.li   li[...]li   ul blockquote  pAnd in this round of overload resolution, there is a tiebreaker in 13.3.3 [over.match.best]p1p  blockquote   pa viable function codeF1code is defined to be a better function than another   viable function F2 if for all arguments codeicode, codeICSiF1code is not a worse   conversion sequence than codeICSiF2code, and thenp      ul   lifor some argument codejcode, codeICSjF1code is a better conversion sequence than codeICSjF2code, or, if not that,li   lithe context is an initialization by userdefined conversion see 8.5, 13.3.1.5, and 13.3.1.6 and the standard conversion sequence from the return type of codeF1code to the destination type i.e., the type of the   entity being initialized is a better conversion sequence than the   standard conversion sequence from the return type of codeF2code to the   destination type.li   ul      pemExample and remainder of the list omittedemp blockquote  pSince the standard conversion sequence from codeintcode to codeintcode Exact Match rank is better than the standard conversion sequence from codecharcode to codeintcode Promotion rank, the first beats the second, and there should be no ambiguity  the conversion defined by codeoperator intcode will be used for the initialization, which then contradicts the sentence in 13.3.3.1 [over.best.ics]p10 that says the function call will be illformed because of ambiguity.p  pIs there anything wrong in the above analysis, or is that sentence a bug in the standardp

My problem is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17756396rhowtogetmany2000rowsfromanrdataframebyrowname1775643817756438this questiona, but the answer does not quite work for me.p  pI have a matrix with 1.7modd rows, and at this point 20 columns. For the purposes of this excercise I only need to extract 20 rows from this matrix, but will need to do more than a 1000 later on. I would like to be able to import a list of all the rows I would like to subset into a smaller matrix for further analysis, and keep I hitting my head against the wall.p  pI have created a smaller matrix with just 2 columns of interest, and set the row names to the animal IDs. The animal IDs are unique.

Extracting the animals onebyone hasnt been too much of a problem, but typing a 1000 names onebyone will be eventually.p  pI dont know it it would be more effective to keep the animalIDs in a column of its own though i.e., make a matrix of 1.7m x 3 instead of 1.7m x 2 and try to subset according to the column animalID. My biggest concern is that list that I want to import and use for subsetting.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2433 pWe are using CrossRider to develop an extension for Internet Explorer. We have an object which is downloaded from a hrefhttpjsons.[partoflinksuppressed].com.s3.amazonaws.comselectors.json relnofollowhttpjsons.[partoflinksuppressed].com.s3.amazonaws.comselectors.jsona. I found out that when this object is sent to a callback, arrays are converted to objects with integer keys. Why are arrays converted to objects and is there a way to prevent it I know we can codeJSON.stringifycode the object and codeJSON.parsecode by the calling function, but is there a way to send arrays without converting them to strings I checked and even code[a,b,c]code is converted to an object code0a,1b,2ccode when calling a function with it.p  pIm using Internet Explorer 11 but this extension should work on all versions of Internet Explorer.p  pstrongEdit 1strong I tested debug mode in Internet Explorer 11 and Google Chrome.

But in our extension ID 43889, if we codeJSON.stringifycode the object and then codeJSON.parsecode it, then its still an array I didnt find how to reproduce it with a simple extension.p  pBy the way, if I type in the console codeJSON.stringify[a,b,c]code in Explorer or Chrome, I get the same result  code[a,b,c]code.p  pI also found another irritating bug  CrossRider converts my staging extensions to production, and I have to switch again to staging manually. It happened at least 5 times with both extensions.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I tried to use codeappAPI.JSON.stringifycode instead of codeJSON.stringifycode and now I receive the correct results in Explorer in extension.js code[a,b,c]code, but background.js is not loaded at all in debug mode and keeps displaying the old contents.

Negative 2433 pI am just learning OOP in Python 2.7 and I want to put together a class that handles frequency data with the following structurep  precodeFreq    Device 1    Device 2    etc.....  100        90           95  500        95           100   .          .            .   .          .            . codepre  pMy first thought was to use a composition of a dataframe to represent the data above along with a units attribute to track the units ex Volts vs milliVolts.  p  pI want to be able to use all of the built in functionality of pandas, like being able to merge DataFrames together, slicing, indexing, plotting etc. I also want to keep track of the units of the data so that when I merge, plot, etc. I can adjust values so they are congruent. p  pIf I create a class based on composition, I find merging is difficultp  precodeclass FreqDataobject     initself, dataNone, indexNone, columnsNone, dtypeNone,                     copyFalse, unitsNone         self.df  DataFramedata, index, columns, dtype, copy         self.units  units codepre  pThen my merge method looks something like thisp  precode    def combineself, fds, axis1          try             chkunits  self.units  fds.units             fds  [fds]         except AttributeError             chkunits  all[self.units  f.units for f in fds]          combinedfd  FreqData         if chkunits             combinedfd.units  self.units             dflist  [f.df for f in fds]             dflist.insert0, self.df             combinedfd.df  pd.concatdflist, axis1             return combinedfd         else             raise TypeErrorOne or more of the FreqData objects measurement                         types does not match codepre  pIs there an easier way to do this using composition or should I try using inheritancep  pAlso, I want to use slicing methods like df[], but Id like to be able to do this on the FreqData object rather than having to write a method likep  precode    def getitemself, key         fd  FreqData         fd.df  self.df.getitemkey         fd.units  self.units         return fd codepre  pThis seems like a bunch of redundant code.

Negative 2433 h1Overviewh1  pIm running some scientific simulations and I want to process the resulting data in Python. The simulation produces a custom data type that is not used outside of the chain of programs that the authors of the simulation produced, so unfortunately I need what they provide me.p  pThey want me to install two filesp  ul liA module called codesdds.pycode that defines a class that provides all user functions and two demosli liA compiled module called codesddsdatamodule.socode that only provides helper functions to codesdds.pycode.li ul  pI find it strange that theyre offering me two modules that are so inextricably connected, it doesnt seem like good coding practice to me, but using their code is probably better than rewriting things from scratch. Id prefer not to install them directly into my path, side by side. They come from the same company, theyre designed to do one specific task together access and manipulate SDDStype files.p  pSo I thought I would put them in a package. I could install that on my path, it would be selfcontained, and I could easily find and uninstall or upgrade the modules from one location. Then I could hide their unPythonic solution in a morePythonic package without significantly rewriting things. Seems elegant.p  h1Detailsh1  pThe package I actually use is found here p  pa hrefhttpwww.aps.anl.govAcceleratorSystemsDivisionAcceleratorOperationsPhysicssoftware.shtmlPythonBinaries relnofollowhttpwww.aps.anl.govAcceleratorSystemsDivisionAcceleratorOperationsPhysicssoftware.shtmlPythonBinariesap  pUnfortunately, they only support Windows and Mac OS X right now. Compiling the source code is quite onerous, and apparently they have no significant requests for LinuxUnix. I have a Mac, so thankfully this isnt a problem for me.p  pSo my directory tree looks like thisp  precodeSDDSPython                   My toplevel package     init.py               Designed to only import the SDDS class     sdds.py                   Defines SDDS class and two demo methods     sddsdatamodule.so         Defines sddsdata module used by SDDS class. codepre  pMy codeinit.pycode file literally only contains thisp  precodefrom sdds import SDDS codepre  pThe codesdds.pycode file contains the class definition and the two demo definitions.

What is going on I can only assume this is happening due to something in the codesddsdatamodule.socode file But how can a module affect its parents namespace like that Im rather lost, and I dont know where to start. Ive looked at the C code, but I dont see anything suspicious. To be fair I probably dont know what something suspicious would look like, Im probably not familiar enough with programming C extensions for Python.p

Negative 2433 pEdit I dont know why the hate for this question but maybe its because of the confusion about my question. I purposely used code ORDERED code to control the order of execution and changes the ordering of the tables in the codeFROMcode clause. I was wondering WHY the execution time can change. Is it because of the join order is it because of the table size Hope this clears out the confusion. p  pSo I was just playing around SQL queries and realized the following If I change the ordering of tables in the FROM clause, the execution time can be very different. The following query runs in about 0.966 sec. But if I move codeOrderDetails dcode to the last of the codeFROMcode clause, the execution is only 0.573 sec Any reason behind this I was using ORACLE SQL Developerp  precodeSELECT  ORDERED      su.CompanyName, CategoryName, ProductName, c.CompanyName, c.country,     FirstName, LastName, Quantity, d.UnitPrice, sh.CompanyName FROM      OrderDetails d, Suppliers su, Shippers sh, Categories t, Products p,     Employees e, Customers c, orders o WHERE      t.CategoryID  p.CategoryID      AND c.CustomerID  o.CustomerID      AND e.EmployeeID  o.EmployeeID      AND o.OrderID  d.OrderID      AND p.ProductID  d.ProductID      AND sh.ShipperID  o.ShipVia      AND su.SupplierID  p.SupplierID      AND LOWERProductName Like lager      AND LOWERc.city IN vancouver, london, charleroi, cunewalde      AND d.Quantity BETWEEN 5 AND 100      AND RequiredDateShippedDate gt 10 ORDER BY      c.CompanyName codepre

Negative 2433 pI am creating basically a shopping cart app and I am trying to populate a listView with images of the items. So currently everything else is displayed just fine like the size, store, description, price, etc. All this information is being retrieved from my existing database and put into the listView. For the images, I have put the names of the images into a column in my database called ID and I have put the actual images into my drawable folder. To make the images show up with their respective item, I am using the getResources method, but for some reason, it isnt working, it wont show the image. I have posted the code below, and youll see the getResources method in my ListItemAdapter.java.

Negative 2433 pThis is my first question so I hope this is the proper way to ask about my issue with the PNEV512B Blueboard by NXP. Basically, it is usually associated with the LPCXpresso LPC 1769 but it comes with a microusb port, which you can set up by soldering jumpers on the board.p  pThe point is that I want to be able to connect it directly using its microusb port to my laptop, which is equipped with an Ubuntu 12.04 distro. But, apparently, there is no library I can use to do that libnfc doesnt support  PN512, and even the library NXP provides in the explore NFC bundle only works with the Raspberry Pi board.p  pMy question is is there a way to change something to one of those 2 libraries the libnfc or NXPs in order to be able to use PNEV512B Blueboard with my Ubuntu Or maybe is there a library I dont know about which supports it p  pthe ending scope of this is to be able to connect it to a generic linux board  Arduino like  so I need to make it work with a broadlysupported libraryp

Negative 2433 pI am using Facebook analytics to track purchase of Inapps in my app for iOS. I have also been using another tool for analytics named, Distimo. The issue I had is that the purchases shown by Distimo and those shown in Facebook developers site for my app differ and by a huge number. I have made sure that the Purchases event gets fired only once from my app when an purchase actually happens. Distimo takes the data for analytics from the App Store. p  pOne scenario which I am aware of is that Facebook shows the events according to the Pacific timezone while Distimo shows data by taking the date which the App Store gives it.  For instance, Say, two downloads occur at the same timep  ul li1 in Japan at 100 on 20130905li li1 in Europe at 1800 on 20130904li ul  pIn Distimo The downloads happened at the same time, but on a different day because of the timezone difference. In this case, the download in japan would count towards the 5th while the download in europe would count towards the 4th.p  pIn Facebook The download in Japan would count towards 4th at time 900 am and the download in Europe would count also count towards 4th at time 900am.p  pHowever, the difference in the number of events seems to be huge. Is there something I am missing here I also cannot get the event logs against which I could validate the number of purchases shown in Facebook.p

Negative 2433 pI am searching for a way to add dynamically  and strongsmoothlystrong new nodes to a force map. While children exist, the click on a node evokes popping them out.

Negative 2433 pI am very new to angular and working on some code that I wanted to upgrade the angular version from 1.2.3 to 1.3.15 which I have also never done before. When I did, the navigation links on my index page stopped working rather it seems like the router.js falls through to my routeProvider.otherwise case and redirects to home you can see the refresh in my jumbotron.  However, I also notice that when I click on the links, my url goes from codelocalhost8888homecode to codelocalhost8888homecode or codelocalhost8888homehomecode or codelocalhost8888homeinfocode, but the page routes dont work the home page gets refreshed instead  like the route is just appended to home and it doesnt know what to do.p  pWhen I remove the deep linking  hash  pound    from the links in index.html, the code appears to work again, but I dont really understand why.  Its highly likely Im misunderstanding something in the breaking changes from 1.2 to 1.3, but the documentation made it seem like using  is still supported in 1.3.p  pBy upgrading I replaced my codeangular.jscode, codeangularresource.jscode, and codeangularroute.jscode in my project with their newer versions.

Negative 2433 pIm trying to serialize a generic class to json, using implicits.p  pMy problem is that the generic class has a non generic superclass which I also want to serialize.

Negative 2433 pI am working on a project where I need to use the SWT DateSpinner on a RAP application webpage. I brought the entire Datespinner API into my project and have made changes to accommodate it in the application. I am trying to dispose the calendar widget when the user clicks anywhere on the page outside the bounds of the calendar dropdown.p  pTo accomplish this I tried adding a focus listener to the widget and the actual date spinner but the onFocusLost method is never executed whenever the datespinner or the calendar composite lose focus.

Negative 2433 pI have a frustrating problem that only manifests itself when plotting filled contour plots on 3D axes and only in certain situations.p  pHere is an example of the issue I am experiencingp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comUnC1b.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUnC1b.png altenter image description hereap  pandp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comjhrqc.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjhrqc.png altenter image description hereap  pThese are the same data at different contouring intervals. Youll notice on the left side of the domain there is misfilling occurring.  This is a plot with the Z points squished into the Z0 plane, via a plotting command likep  precodeax3d.contourfX, Y, dbz[z25,,], zdirz, offset0, levelslevels, cmappymeteoradar, alpha0.50 codepre  pThe miscontouring happens regardless of alpha level or colormap used, but is sensitive to the number of levels.  The use of codezdircode and codeoffsetcode do not effect the miscontouring the artifact just occurs on the Z surface.  If I do not fill the contour, there is no miscontouring.  I can also alter the domain to sometimes make the issue better or worse, but I have many plots to make within the same domain so that is not a fix.p  pThis issue does not occur when the same data is plotted on 2D axes, e.g.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comtRfkI.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtRfkI.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThis plot has some extra data on it, but you can

My data is regularly gridded and for the domain in question is uniform in X and Y.  In this case the misfilling will go away if the number of contour levels is reduced.  In some other cases this does not always help or just changes the visual appearance of the error.  In any case, even at very coarse contouring I still get errors in a subset of my plots.p  pHas anyone seen this before and found a fix for it  Am I overlooking something Im open to workarounds that dont involve lowering my contouring level which does reduce the errors overall.  If others are in agreement that this could be a bug in the mplot3d, I will file a bug report with them a hrefhttpsgithub.commatplotlibmatplotlibissues4784 relnofollowIssue opened herea.

Negative 2433 pI write a C Windows Universal App where the user can copy a file into the clipboard. But if the App is closed the clipboard content gets lost.

Negative 2433 pI am not sure whether norm and Euclidean distance mean the same thing. Please could you help me with this distinction. p  pI have an codencode by codemcode array codeacode, where codemcode  3.

Negative 2433 pIm currently refactoring a project used by two applicationprojects and facing following problemp  pThe old project should be split up into three new projects A, B and C, because its growing and getting confusing.p  pSo project A is implementing classes used by application 1, project B is implementing some other classes used by application 2 and rest of the classes which are used by both applications 1 and 2 should be implemented in project C.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com8GvGSJ2.png althttpi.imgur.com8GvGSJ2.pngp  pI already began the refactoring, so the structure is existing and working.

In eclipse manually I can select the classname of every java class and go to references  workspace and check the results but I hope someone has a better idea p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 2433 pIm currently making a web game that connects to a php file on the server to get certain values this is to hide some codes from endusers.

Negative 2433 pI have an application deployed to OpenShift as a jbossews2.0. The application has stopped working and as far as Im aware Ive not changed anything. I dont use it very often, but I think it worked after the last change I made.p  pWhen I look in the Tomcat access log every url I send invokes a 404 response. The obvious thing to do is to reinstall the application, but before I do this I would like to find out why its not working.p  pI would like to invoke the Tomcat console to check the status of the application. I used rhc portforward and then entered 127.0.0.18080 into the browsers. This was recorded in the access log but return a 404. This could be due to not having a relevant Tomcat user. In tomcatusers.xml I addedp  precodeltrole rolenametomcatgt ltrole rolenamemanagerguigt ltuser usernametomcat passwordtomcat rolestomcat,managerguigt codepre  pin p  pNote While doing this I made some errors, which showed up in the logs, so Im fairly sure Im changing the correct file.p  pYet again entering 127.0.0.18080 resulted in a 404 error in the access log.p  pI have 2 questionsp  p1 Should the changes I made to tomcatusers.xml allow me to invoke the Tomcat console in the way Im attempting to.p  p2 Can anyone identify what my problem may be or how I can debug the issue.p  pNote When I start the gear I get the followingp  precodeStarting gear... Starting MySQL 5.1 cartridge Starting jbossews cartridge Found 127.13.135.1298080 listening port codepre  pI dont recall if the final message is purely informational. It could imply that the port was already in use and is not available for Tomcat, but I would have expected an error to be reported in a log somewhere and I did not find one. This could explain the symptoms Im getting.p  pI would like to understand why this has happened, as it would cause an issue in a production system. No doubt it is something Ive done wrongp

A team is using it to store large archive files mostly 1.6GB, sometimes 4.5GB and that has been mostly fine, but now they are getting strange behaviour where they get a 504 Gateway Timeout on files that definitely exist. After some time, the files will become available, as if they have been downloaded. It might be recent uploads, or from several days ago, it seems fairly random. p  pI understand this error occurs with proxy repositories if the remote repo is slow, but this is hosted How can it have a timeout error retrieving a file on diskp  pThese errors do not appear in the logs at all, are shown in a box in the GUI, and it seems like its coming from some kind of frontend talking to a backend which is slow. There are no other relevant entries in the log file that explain why hosted files were slow to retrieve. Is there some kind of loading or hashing happening that would cause this, and can we turn it off or at least monitor it p  pThis is causing builds to break frequently in a major project and we cant even monitor when and how often it happens because there is no logs. p  pOur Nexus version is a bit old, 2.6.402, is upgrading likely to fix We need a solution that is either fast or has a good chance of working. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 2433 pemHi all After years using Stackoverflow, I am posting my first question. Here it isemp  pI am creating an application that performs social media analytics for several customers. Everything was easy when my codeNodeJScode app was only dealing with a single customer, because I could use codeSocket.iocode to connect to  codeTwittercode and codeInstagramcode real time APIs, do some calculations and return data to the browser also using codeSocket.iocode.p  pNow I need to scale this solution, and I was wondering if its feasible to refactor the App, so on startup, it loads the configuration for all the customers using it social media account details, basically, and use threads or clusters to have dedicated processes for each customer.p  pEach client would open a socket to the server, with an identifier, and they would get their data from that specific threadcluster. Also, some processes can be running for days i.e. analysing a marketing campaign impact on Twitter for a week. So I definitely cant block another customers processes. And I could be opening real time streams from Twitter using different api keys, searching for different things.p  pI bet it must be quite complex to achieve this, specially when the number of customers grows. If there was no real time data, I could just have a Rest API and a single process serving all requests. But the main feature I would like to have is true realtime data, to display it in interactive dashboards.p  pIve seen this a hrefhttpsgithub.comeladnodeclustersocket.io relnofollownodeclustersocket.i0a It seems interesting, but since I am quite new to codeNodeJScode, maybe that approach is not quite what I need.p  pAny advise, suggestion or solution when implementing a similar solution using codeNodeJScodep

The problem is that the JPanel has a lot of content, so I had to use a JScrollPane for scrolling. Still, I want to print it into a PDF, probably using separate pages and, of course, without the scrollbar because I dont think I can create a PDF that uses it. How can I split this JPanel into small JPanels for fitting into pages of a PDF which I create using iText   p

Negative 2433 pIm making a bar graph that looks something like this does not show the problem a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net8ywf45s1 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net8ywf45s1a.p  pThe Problem In Firefox theres this thing that happens where the bars look like they become dissociated from the base line, as opposed to running smoothly like in Chrome.

The bars that dissociate differ per data set, but they are consistently the same for that specific data set.p  pIm not sure this is enough information for anyone to provide help.  The entirely of the project is a bit large, and it reads .csv data to generate the info for the bars so it could take a while to get an example of the problem up and running.

Negative 2433 pI want to create a modular process which will merge the devel branch upon each successful build to the master branch, and it will also create a tag. Is there any way to do it using Jenkins and Git plugin rather than writing code. If yes, is there any option to provide Git plugin the repository URL as a parameter, so it will be as modular as possible. The job that I want to create will be performing only the merge codegit merge nocommit X theirscode operation and it will create a tag the tag name will be provided as a parameter as well.This job will be triggered by other jobs.p
