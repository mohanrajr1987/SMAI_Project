Positive 49 pIm trying to build a form for a like button. This like model is polymorphic to different types of Models comments  posts  etc. and belongs to a certain user.p  pWhen this user is viewing a blog item for instance, I want to show a like button below the post. Ive setup my routes in a way that the like routes are always nested inside the polymorphic object for which they are destinedp  pSo for posts for instancep  precode routes.rb   resources posts do    resources likes, only [create, destroy]   end codepre  pSo a post link would look like postspostidlikes method Postp  pIn the controller I create a new Like object, assign it to a user and save it. This works perfectly.p  pThe problem is when Im trying to create delete form. I really have no clue how to create that, I know the link should be postspostidlikeid method Delete, but configuring it this way results in an errorp  pI think the form could also be refactored, but I have no clue on how making forms for these kind of complex relationships.p  precodesharedlikebutton.html.haml   if not post.islikedby currentuser    formforpost.likes.build, url postlikespathpost do f    f.submit  else    formforpost.likes.findbyuserid currentuser.id, url postlikepathpost, html method delete do f  f.submit codepre  pEDITp  pI think the main problem is that postlikepathpost doenst get rendered correctly because Im not aware of the id of the like. So I keep getting an ActionControllerUrlGenerationError in PostsControllershow error when trying to build the link.p

Negative 49 pI have a library written in C for which I need to readwrite representations of my objects to disk or to any Stream in a particular binary format to ensure compatibility with CJava library implementations. The format requires a fair amount of bitpacking and some DEFLATEd bytestreams. I would like my library, however, to be as idiomatic .NET as possible, however, and so would like to provide an API as close as possible to the normal binary serialization process. Im aware of the ability to implement the IFormatter interface, but being that I really am unable to reuse any part of the builtin serialization stack, is it worth doing this, or will it just bring unnecessary overhead. In other wordsp  pImplement IFormatter and co.p  pORp  pJust provide SerializeDeserialize methods that act on a Streamp  phr p  pA good point brought up below about needing the serialization semantics for any case involving Remoting. In a case where using MarshalByRef objects is feasible, Im pretty sure that this wont be an issue, so leaving that aside are there any benefits or drawbacks to using the ISerializableIFormatter versus a custom stack or, is my understanding remoting incorrectlyp

Negative 49 pI need a command line that can check the port status on a remote host.  I tried ping xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx161  but it doesnt recognize the host.  I thought it was a good answer until I did the same command against a host I know has that port open.  This is for a batch file on Windows that will check the status of the remote port then run a command that uses that remote port for information, then the remote port check command again, then the command that uses that port on the next server for information, and so on. Ive looked everywhere and thought the ping might do it, but there must be various versions of ping, I suppose as the server I am doing this on does not show that option.p  pJust for chuckles, I tried a webbased remote port checker from a website  and the results were correct for both the problem server and the correct server.  However, I cant use that in a batch run with 500 server IPs in it.  p  pIs there something I can do that is simple  My perl skills are extremely rusty use it or lose it, dont know any other windows based langs except DOS.

Negative 49 pSo, Id like to hear what you all think about this.p  pI have a project where three different inheritance paths need to all implement another base class.

Then I have the same code in each of the three abstract classes.p  pI could use a single interface, but I would still need to duplicate the code. p  pI could make some kind of static class that implements the code and then reference that in each of the 3 abstract classes.  It would eliminate the duplication, but, I am not sure how I feel about this.  I could implement Extensions methods on the interface, but then the interface itself would be empty and the extension methods containing the duplicate code would be in a totally different file, which seems not quite right.  Plus I cant implement properties in extension methods...p  pHow can I factor out the code duplication herep  pEDIT, inheritance treep  precodeclass Class1  3rdPartyBaseClass1   class Class2  3rdPartyBaseClass2   class Class3  3rdPartyBaseClass3   codepre  pI have code I want to be in each of the above Classes, but I cannot add it to the 3rdPartyClasses.p

Negative 49 pI have a problem with  a socket library that uses WSAASyncSelect to put the socket into asynchronous mode. In asynchronous mode the socket is placed into a nonblocking mode WSAWOULDBLOCK is returned on any operations that would block and windows messages are posted to a notification window to inform the application when the socket is ready to be read, written to etc.p  pMy problem is this  when receiving a FDREAD event I dont know how many bytes to try and recv. If I pass a buffer thats too small, then winsock will automatically post another FDREAD event telling me theres more data to read. If data is arriving very fast, this can saturate the message queue with FDREAD messages, and as WMTIMER and WMPAINT messages are only posted when the message queue is empty this means that an application could stop painting if its receiving a lot of data and useing asynchronous sockets with a too small buffer.p  pHow large to make the buffer then I tried using ioctlsocketFIONREAD to get the number of bytes to read, and make a buffer exactly that large, BUT, a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb192599 relnofollowKB192599a explicitly warns that that approach is fraught with inefficiency.p  pHow do I pick a buffer size thats big enough, but not crazy bigp

Both the numerator and denominator can be any integer number. The numerator can never be greater than the denominator and is never negative.  Therefore, the result is always from 0100.  Right now, this is done by simply using floating point math and is somewhat slow, since its being calculated tens of millions of times.  I really dont need anything more accurate than to the nearest 0.1 percent.  And, I just use this calculated value to see if its bigger than a fixed constant value.

Negative 49 pI was working with a WPF application and I decided that the controls and graphics I wanted to display on the grid might look better if it was a silverlight component.p  pI thought this way because of all the cool silverlight controls that look very flashlike.  p  pBut now that I have gottem my Visual Studio 2010 set up with SIlverlight, it seems that every silverlight app I can make are ASP.NET in nature.

Negative 49 pFor the last couple of Days I have been working on a small web application.  I decided to use ASP.NET MVC.  I made this decision mostly because I think it is the best way to really control the web frontend and render valid HTML pages.  However, I know that MVC can be much more.p  pEven though my App is quite small, I am focusing on my applications architecture.  It is important to me to have several layers, two of which should be switchable at any time the user interface Web  Desktop  Webservices and the data access logic to support several databases. I thought that in a Model View Controller pattern this would be possible. p  pIn this case will it be possible to replace my web based frontend with a Win32 or WPF front end Is this possible or did I understand something wrong I couldnt find a way to do this. p  pThe only way I found to do this is to create an MVCLayer, BusinessLogicLayer, BusinessObjectLayer and a DataAccessLayer.  In that case all generic stuff which can be reused by a WPF App for example I put into the business layer, all the MVC specific Stuff I put in the MVCLayer, and most what my Controller does is calling BL Methods and building a ViewModel and returning it to the view. I am not sure if this is a correct interpretation and would be thankful for suggestions about better practices.p

Am I correct in my judgement I am just confused since its not a new object, would it cause any problems in disposing an object that simply is a reference pointer to the commandp  pMany thanksp

The only properties which I need restricted to filenames, and their contents data.p  pThe files maxlength is 100MB, most of them are less than 1MB. The ability of removing files is required, and both writing and reading speeds should be a priority  while low storage efficiency, recovery or integrity methods, are not needed.p  pI thought about NTFS, but most of its features are not needed, while cant be disabled and considered to be an overhead concern, a few of them are creation date, modification date, attribs, journal and of course permissions.p  pDue to the native features of a filesystem which are not needed, would you suggest Ill use SQLITE for this requirement or theres an obvious disadvantage that I should be aware about one would guess that removing files will be a complicated taskp  pSQLITE will be via the C apip  pMy goal is to use a more suited solution to gain performance.

Negative 49 pImagine two common situations combined A JDialogor JFrame which closes on VKESCAPE set as key binding on the root pane and an inner JPopupMenu which is supposed to close on ESC as well. The problem is pressing escape always closes the dialog  event if the popup is visible. Apparently the popup doesnt even receive the key event so it cant be consumed by the popup. Is there any way to get this working correctly, so that on the first ESCevent the popup is closed and on the second the dialog closes By the way It does work with a JComboBox, which by default closes when escape is pressed.p

Negative 49 pI am trying to use a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comelasticmapreduce relnofollowAmazon Elastic Map Reducea to run a series of simulations of several million cases.

Whats the good practice that covers things like that In general, what should I think about constructorsinit methods that take a list of values Should they leave it intact Am I allowed to reuse the list and whose fault is it when it leads to an errorp  pI mean, I obviously can do something like that p  precodevar triangle  new Trianglenew ListltVertexgtvertices codepre  pbut shouldnt it be done by the creators of the codeTrianglecode class alreadyp  pI would like to know some guidelines on that.

Negative 49 pWe have flat files CSV with 200,000,000 rows, which we import into a star schema with 23 dimension tables. The biggest dimension table has 3 million rows. At the moment we run the importing process on a single computer and it takes around 15 hours. As this is too long time, we want to utilize something like 40 computers to do the importing.p  pMy questionp  pstrongHow can we efficiently utilize the 40 computers to do the importing. The main worry is that there will be a lot of time spent replicating the dimension tables across all the nodes as they need to be identical on all nodes. This could mean that if we utilized 1000 servers to do the importing in the future, it might actually be slower than utilize a single one, due to the extensive network communication and coordination between the servers.strong p  pDoes anyone have suggestion p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe following is a simplification of the CSV files p  precodeavalueanothervalue bvalueevenanothervalue avalueevenanothervalue avalueevenanothervalue  bvalueevenanothervalue avalueanothervalue codepre  pAfter importing, the tables look like thisp  pdimensiontable1p  precodeid  name 1   avalue 2   bvalue codepre  pdimensiontable2p  precodeid  name 1   anothervalue 2   evenanothervalue codepre  pFact tablep  precode  dimensiontable1ID       dimensiontable2ID     1                      1     2                      2     1                       2     1                       2                   2                       2     1                       1 codepre

Negative 49 pI do a networking app using iPhones and their limited memory is something I must consider. My codeMessagecode class holds both a image and a video.

Negative 49 pI am building a JavaScript application, and primarily testing it in Chrome. The application involves a fair share of DOM manipulation and building.p  pMy problem Under certain circumstances, the application suddenly becomes several times slower. It appears to be a boolean thing, and predictable each time I do a certain action, it will become slow, and stay so until I do one of specific other actions, upon which the performance returns to the normal.p  pWhat puzzles me is that there is nothing I can see in the code that would suggest a reason for this. Sorry, the code is too complex to give a sample, especially given that I cant isolate what causes this.p  pOne of the actions that speeds it back up is clicking in the document even the empty areas, even if I dont register any relevant mousedownclick handlers, somehow a click magically restores the application to health. In contrast, programmatically clearing focus with codedocument.find.blurcode, nor focusing an unfocused element with codesomebutton.focuscode do not help.p  pI also tested on Firefox and Opera. I have pretty severe performance problems in Firefox its DOM manipulation is much slower Firebug says it spends most of its time in codejQuery.attrcode  not relevant here, but it appears that I do not get slowed down by this particular bug the performance is the same before and after the action that would trigger the slowdown in Chrome. Opera is also not affected.p  pI havent yet tried Safari, and I cant test on IE heavy reliance on SVG, and other issues.p  pSo Does anyone have any ideas what could be impacting my performance Or at least, an idea about what effect could a click have if it is not caught by the handler, and if programmatic focus change does not do the same Ive run out of ideas for debugging this thing.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I guess I can isolate the code anyway. codefileBrowsercode is a codeformcode later made into jQuery UI modal dialog.p  precode  var fileBrowserSubmit  functionevt       trigger the big render  either 300ms or 3s      var chooseDocument  functionevt       set up variables pertaining to the selected tr,      style the tr as selected      var chooseDocumentAndSubmit  functionevt      chooseDocumentevt     fileBrowserSubmitevt      fileBrowser.     submitfileBrowserSubmit   fileBrowser.findtr.     clickchooseDocument.     dblclickchooseDocumentAndSubmit codepre  pIf I click on a codetrcode, then click codeOKcode thus submitting the form, no slowdown the code called from codefileBrowserSubmitcode gets executed in 300msp  pIf I doubleclick on a codetrcode, slowdown the rendering function will run for 3s on the sample data I am testing on.p  pIt can be seen that the executed code in both cases is almost identical codechooseDocumentcode followed by codefileBrowserSubmitcode.p
Negative 49 pI am looking for the best way in which you would setup navigation in an Android game a best practice for Android Game Activity Navigation. I have the following scenariop  ul liA Main Menu Activity Greets the User on Start and gives them options li liA RunLever Activity This runs a level of the gameli liA Transitional Menu Activity This appears between levels and shows scores and stuff like that while providing a button to go to the next levelli ul  pTherefore, if the player starts the game and completes two levels they might have an activity stack that looks something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDdMXO.png altDiagram of possible program flow.p  pThe problem that I have here is one of expectations when the back button is pressed p  ul liIf I was on the last In Between Menu and I pressed back then I would expect to go back to the Main Menu. Instead it would probably take me back to the level that I just won.li liI would not expect the last levels that I have played and previous In Between Menu activities to stay sitting there in the Back Stack. I would only expect the Main Menu, the Current Level I am playing and one instance of the In Between Menu to be sitting in the back stack at any one time.li ul  pAs far as I can tell everything else will work properly and as the user expects. I guess I just want to know what the best options are to solve this kind of problem. To make sure that the activities in this game occur as expected. Should they even be separate Activities Thanks.p

Negative 49 pI used to work on IronLua in my spare time. Lexing and parsing is currently done. I kind of stopped working on it out of frustration since implementing Lua coroutines in .NET without resorting to dirty threading hacks is not easy. This is tied to how I compile Lua functions, and its a problem I need to solve early while designing the compiler.p  pIve been researching coroutine implementations, and it turns out that my initial feelings about continuations were correct.p  pSince coroutine creation, yield and other operations are not language keywords, but functions in the coroutine table, I cannot statically switch to CPSstyle compilation as the coroutine table might have been overwritten by a previous script. While I understand that scripts overwriting the coroutine table are a rare occurrence, Id like to be on the safe side and approach the issue as cleanly as possible.p  pMy plan is to use continuationpassing style for every expression, no matter if were in a coroutine or not. Everything would be followed by a continuation.p  pBesides the obvious difficulty of writing a compiler in the first place, and adding CPS transform on top of it, Im troubled by this design decision and its performance implications.p  pIm looking for advice about Lua coroutine implementation in .NET.p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 49 pIs it possible to specify the struct packing size in a C implementation of a COM interfacep  pI know how to do it when the struct is emdefinedem on the managed side, but my question is about when its defined on the unmanaged side and emimplementedem on the managed side.p  pIve got a COM type library that defines a struct type and an interface method that returns an array of those structs. Ive got a C server and an unmanaged C server that both implement this interface, and a C client that consumes it. The C server and the C client both pack the struct to 4 bytes in a 32bit build, and to 8 bytes in a 64bit build.p  pBut the C server always packs to 4 bytes, regardless of platform x86, x64, AnyCPU. Is this normal Can it be overriddenp  pThe struct looks like thisp  precodetypedef [v1enum] enum  blah...  HandlerPriority struct HandlerInfo  BSTR MessageName HandlerPriority Priority  codepre  pThe Visual Studio C and MIDL compilers use a default packing of Zp8. In a 32bit build both members of the struct are 4 bytes wide, and so they are not padded. In a 64bit build the string pointer is 8 bytes and the enum 4, so the enum is padded. Naturally, this causes problems when the C client sends unpadded data.p  pI can fix work around the problem by specifying Zp4 to remove the padding, and everything seems to work fine. But I wonder whether thats the best solution.p  pI imagine the default packing is Zp8 for performance reasons only. As I understand it, by default on x64 the hardware traps and handles alignment exceptions and so at least we wont crash. And in this particular situation I dont care about the performance penalty because the interface function is only called at system startup. And even if I did care I might still accept it as the cost of COM.NET interop. But Im a little uneasy because it feels wrong coming from a C background, I suppose.p  pOn the other hand, if its simply not possible to change the packing on the managed side, then Ill live with it.p  pCan anyone give me some advicep

Negative 49 pIm working on a card game that will have hundreds of connected clients, each playing a 4 person game. It has a lobby, as well as a lobby chat.p  pTherefore, what i do not need is a library that tries to send packets very quickly Like for an FPS game. What I would like is a library that handles authentication, lobbying, server discovery, compression, encryption and other high level, often application level or dependent tasks. p  pMaybe not all of those features, but those are the ones that ENet lacks. Im considering using enet if I cannot find better, but I feel then like Ill be reinventing the wheel a lot which is error prone.p  pIdeally, it could handle things like disconnection gracefully and be very event driven this way I do not have to make and manage a thread for it. p  pThis is for commercial use zlib, BSD, MIT, etc, as long as I do not have to pay or forced to dynamically link it.p  pThanksp

Then 2 levels would be fine but I have not been able to work out how to do that.p  pThe code I have at present recurses manually for three levels from the starting organization but what I want is to recurse through all related records.p  pSo it would start with an Org and add Orgs array of children board members. Then fetch all of the boards other than current Org for each board member and add those as children of the board member.p  pThis would continue until each trail dead ends  presumably at a board member who only belongs to one board.p  pAnyone have advice on how to create this array and avoid duplicatesp  precodeboard  centergtboard  top[id]  centergtID top[name]  centergtOrg top[children]  array if board      foreach board as b          child[id]  bgtID         child[name]  strlentrimbgtLast gt 0  bgtFirst .   . bgtLast  Unknown         child[data][orgname]  centergtOrg         child[data][relation]  bgtRole         child[data][occupation]  bgtOccupation         child[children]  array         childboards  bgtboards         if childboards  foreach childboards as cb               gchild[id]  cbgtID             gchild[name]  cbgtOrg             gchild[data][orgname]  strlentrimbgtLast gt 0  bgtFirst .   . bgtLast  Unknown             gchild[children]  array             childboardmembers  cbgtboard             if childboardmembers  foreach childboardmembers as cbm                  ggchild[id]  cbmgtID                 ggchild[name]  strlentrimcbmgtLast gt 0  cbmgtFirst .   . cbmgtLast  Unknown                 ggchild[data][orgname]  cbgtOrg                 ggchild[data][relation]  cbmgtRole                 ggchild[data][occupation]  cbmgtOccupation                 ggchild[children]  array                 gchild[children][] ggchild                          child[children][] gchild                  top[children][]  child        top[data]  array top[data][description]  centergtDesc echo jsonencodetop codepre  p Edit 2011.10.24  In Re hakre response My data structure is a table of Organizations with unique IDs, a table of People with Unique IDs, and then a bridging table for the two specifying Organization Entity and Person and the Role the Person is playing in the Entity.

Negative 49 pIll describe you my development teams and the software delivery phasesp  pWe have some Java JAR files that contains the Services logic but shared but two main development teams who attend different business areas. We both share the use and responsibility of these services and often receive requirements to implement changes on the same modules at the same time. When development phase is over, the jar is passed to Quality Assurance and then to Production if everythings OK with it.p  pWe use Subversion recently migrated from CVS and we create a new branch per requirement received so the concurrent developments for the same jar do not impact each other. The problem is when these two or more concurrent developments go to QA and they get in the queue to be tested. When one of these requirements go to Production phase it merges to the main root branch and the others working on changes for the same jar must be notified in order to update their branches with the new production version so when they go to QAProduction they dont override the recent changes.p  pIn conclusion, I want to know if Im using version control correctly, if Im using the most suitable version control flavor Subversion for my concurrent developments and if theres a better way to forkmerge branches used in concurrent developments.p
Negative 49 pOf late, Ive been designing sites that are more responsive and Ive been using these media queries pretty frequently.

Negative 49 pWhat is most efficient way to compare date range in case of open end date i.e. optional end date I want to compare effective date and optional end date given by user with any existing overlapping effective date and optional end date in database.If they overlap I want to display error message. Effective date is required and end date is optional.p  pImportantp  peffective and end date situation can be implemented in two general ways.p  p1 By having end date as DB column  For example, Mortgage or saving account rate. The rate becomes effective at certain point of time and then it stays in effect till next rate becomes effective and ends previous rates effect.At given point of time at least one record will be in effect.p  p2 By not having end date in database  For example, Discount, coupoun, promotion or special offer. These all can become effective and end at certain point of time. It is possible that at given time no special offer or discount is running.p  pScenario 1 is easy to implement. Every time you insert or edit the record you have to check there is no equivelent record in db with exact same effective dateand time.p  pScenario 2 may have two further flavors.p  p2.1 End date is always required.user entered or default with year 9999 In such case, if you find any record that has start1 lt end1 and start2 lt end2 then you have overlap.p  p2.2 End date is optional in that case null means positive infinity. User can enter end date or leave it blank. This can be tricky to validate as more possible combination. You may need to generate query dynamically based on user has given end date or notp  precodeifuserEnd  null    query.appenddbStartltuserEnd  query.appenddbEnd is null  dbStartgtuserStart ampamp dbEndgtuserStart codepre  pIf this query finds any result then you are overlaping range. Going one step further if you have requirement to automatically end date previous record if previous records end date is null then you may want to modify above query as below to pass validation.p  precodeifuserEnd  null    query.appenddbStartltuserEnd  query.appenddbEnd is null ampamp dbStartgtuserStart  dbStartgtuserStart ampamp dbEndgtuserStart codepre  pDepending on other requirements you may need deleteDate to mark record invalid.

Negative 49 pI have a stack of images, absolutely positioned on the same place and I only have one image visible at a time by setting zIndex1 for all images but the visible one. On another side of the page I have a list of all the image names and when I hover on a specific image name I want that image to become visible by fading in and the previously visible one to fade out. I do this with this code p  precodethis.hover  visible and hover below are variable names           visible.cssopacity 0,zIndex 1 the previous image diassapears         hovered.css zIndex 1, opacity 1 the new image fades in      codepre  pand by transitioning the opacity property through css. The problem is that when I hover over a new image name, the old image just disappears without fading out and the new one starts to fade in. I suppose that the old image does indeed fade out, yet it does so in the background due to zIndex1 becoming immediately effective. I would like to ask the best way to solve this. Please, notice that I want to do this without using jQuery animations and only using pure css animations just to take advantage of the minimally higher speed of css animations. So a solution that puts almost no computational overhead so that a css animation in this case still remains advantageous would be preferable.p

Negative 49 pThis is my first post on Stack Overflow, and I have a relatively simple beginner SQL question. My task is to find the number of occurrences of late timesheet submissions for each employee in our database. There are two tables which I have primarily been looking at, but Im having trouble putting the two together and coming up with a decent view of the COUNT of occurances and the employee ID for which they are associated with. p  pI have created this query which provides me with the codeEmployeeIDcode for each occurence.p  precodeSELECT db.Employee.EmployeeID  FROM db.LateTimesheets INNER JOIN db.Employee ON Employee.LastName  LateTimesheets.LastName AND Employee.FirstName  Late Timesheets.FirstName codepre  pNow, with this simple query I have a view of the codeEmployeeIDcode repeated however many times these incidents have occured. However, what I ultimately want to end up with is a table that displays a count for each occurance, along with the codeEmployeeIDcode for which this count is associated with.p  pI would assume I would need to use the codeCOUNTcode function to count the amount of rows for each codeEmployeeIDcode, and then select that value along with codeEmployeeIDcode. However, Im having trouble structuring the subquery correctly, and everything I have tried thus far has only generated errors with MS SQL Server Management Studio.p  pAny help would be appreciated.

For any page in our domain, theyll add a special url argument like codeampmykeytopleveldomain.comcode, telling us what the pages top level domain is.p  pOur filters pick up the partner TLD, if provided, from the URL, and validate it against a whitelist.  If its on the list, we ship the codeXFrameOptionscode header with value codeALLOWFROM topleveldomain.comcode and add a cookie for future clicks.  If its not on our whitelist, we ship codeSAMEORIGINcode or codeDENYcode.p  pThe problem is it looks like sending codeALLOWFROM domaincode results in a noop overall for the latest Firefox and Google Chrome.

Right after the 5th of 5 boxes that should be showing content, is a box that should NOT be showing content, but which is.

The requirements are The table shall capture a minimum of 12 recent years hopefully more of incepted claims. Each claim shall have a valuation date for each monthend occurring between claim inception and the current date. Typical claim inception volumes range from 50k100k per year. p  pAdding all this up I project a table with a row count on the order of 100 million, and could grow to as much as 500 million over years depending on the businesss needs. The table will be rebuilt each month. Consumers will select only. Other than a monthly refresh, no updates, inserts or deletes will occur.p  pI am coming at this from the business consumer side, but I have an interest in mitigating the IT cost while preserving the analytical value of this table.

Negative 49 pI have an app which is based on a codeUINavigationControllercode.  There is a menu screen with buttons that segue push onto navigation controller stack to one of 9 other subscreens.  None of these subscreens segue to any other screen. When a user is done inputing data on a subscreen they can press a done button which will pop back to the original menu screen.  If youre having difficulty picturing this, imagine a tree like storyboard where there is one root ViewController and then 9 leaf viewControllers.p  pOk, so with that setup I have a few questions about how codeviewDidLoadcode works.p  p First, is codeviewDidLoadcode supposed to be called every time we transition to a subscreen. For example, suppose I go from the menu screen to subscreen B, back to the menu screen and then back to subscreen B. Should Bs codeviewDidLoadcode method be called twice If not, why might mine be getting called twicep  p Second, assuming that it will get called each time, what do I do if I have a lot of long operations that need to be performed exactly one time for each subscreen Where should I put them if I put them in codeviewDidLoadcode it would happen multiple times if the user kept going back and forth between this page and the menup

When I deploy my application to the AdminServer, all is good. I see 3 log files in the domain directory. Goodness.p  pWhen I deploy to my other WebLog server in the same domain. All the log messages are pumped to the server.out file.  The server.out file, from what I read, is where nodemanager puts all logging messages for the server for stdoutstderr. Obviously, we need to deploy to the NonAdminServer...but our log files from log4j are not there.p  pI am racking my brain trying to figure out what is different between and AdminServer and a nonAdmin Server in WebLogic...and why it is confiscated my log messages.  The only diff I can see is the server is startedmanaged by nodemanager...p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 49 pI understand how keystores work for private keys. Basically you create a keystore, generatesignstore the keys and based on the alias the container JBoss, tomcat, WebLogic or WebSphere will load the appropriate keys during initialization. My question has to do with the truststores. If the container makes a request to an external website, which has a key signed by say Thawte, how does the container know which public key to supply from its truststore to allow the ssl handshake to complete  The truststore definitely has an alias but when the container invokes a connection to a remote site, I really doubt if it uses an alias to find the matching public key.p

Negative 49 pI have a wxLua Gui app that has a Run button. Depending on selected options, Run can take a long time, so I would like to implement a Cancel buttonfeature. But it looks like everything in wxLua is working on one Gui thread, and once you hit Run, pressing Cancel does nothing, the Run always goes to completion.p  pCancel basically sets a variable to true, and the running process regularly checks that variable. But the Cancel button press event never happens while Running.p  pI have never used coroutines if the Run process regularly yields to a Cancel check process, will the Cancel event happen thenp  pOr is there another wayp

Negative 49 pIm using iTextSharp 5.3.2.0 to add information to an existing PDF file that contains a W2 form.

If I look at the temporary file thats been streamed down through my browser, the PDF file written by iTextSharp is approximately 150K.  However, when I answer Yes to the Save Changes question asked by Acrobat Reader, the resulting file is approximately 80K again.  iTextSharp is definitely doing something unexpected to this file.p

Negative 49 pI have some C code that Id like to debug. As its often the case, my bug appears only in certain conditions that cannot be reproduced with tiny datasets, and it appears after going through multiple functions that I am sure work.p  pIn particular, I first need to put all my data in an codestdsetcode which is very slow in debug mode and reasonable in release, even when using an codeITERATORDEBUGLEVEL 0code preprocessor directive. As such, I was thinking that there might have been a way to execute part of the code in release while only executing the relevant buggy part of the code in debug mode.p  pI tried doing something like p  precodeifdef DEBUG undef DEBUG define MODIFIEDDEBUG define NDEBUG endif   build my expensive datastructure etc. etc.  ifdef MODIFIEDDEBUG undef MODIFIEDDEBUG undef NDEBUG define DEBUG endif   execute my buggy code codepre  pHowever, this is still as slow as in debug mode. I there any easy way to get the speed of the release mode only for part of my code  Especially since the slowness is mostly due to the STL.  I guess I could compile a .lib that builds the datastructure in release and use the library in my code in debug mode, but thats quite a pain just to debug a program. Alternatively, is there any trick like the codeITERATORDEBUGLEVEL 0code definition to speed up the STL in debug mode  I am using Visual Studio 2010.p  pThanksp

Negative 49 pI have a form which has two sections, both of which contain a particular field that is business required. In my current scenario the first of these sections is hidden, while the second is visible. Basically, which of the two is visible is set in JScript and depends on the value of a drop down list.p  pThe problem is that if the user does not enter a value for the mandatory field and then hits save, the form attempts to validate it on the first of the two occurrences, i.e. the one that is not visible. When it discovers that the user has not filled this value, it then brings the hidden section into view despite the fact that the same offending field is already in view further down the form.p  pIs there any way I can stop it doing this, or workaround my issue in another wayp  pstrongEditstrongp  pOK, from the answers below, I think maybe I didnt make the situation clear enough. I dont think setting the field to be nonmandatory, or filling it with a token value, will do the trick because I do want the mandatory status to be validated if the user has not filled in the field.p  pThe issue Im having is that having validated it, it is showing the user the version of the field that had been hidden, rather than the one that is already visible.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0REQD.png altImage depicting the scenario. When the form is validated, the hidden section shown with red border appears, because the quotConsultantquot field is not filledp  pAs far as I know the simple API, to set the field to mandatory or not, applies equally to any occurrences of that field on the form, not one specific one.p

Statistics is the followingp  precodeWeek from join Week 1  Week 2  Week 3  Week 4  Week 5 Level up       5      15     40     30     10 codepre  pThat is, if during this week we had some people joined the game, 5 weeks after all of them will pass to the next level some will give up and leave, but for the simplicity I do not include that factor in the list of conditions.p  pAs for every game, the number of current players matters. To keep the game popular and exciting, there should be definite strongminimalstrong number of players on each level. Obviously, this value is changing constantly new people come, while others move to the next level. However  and thats where the action begins  this strongminimal value of current players is NOT constantstrong and may wary depending on many factors. For the simplicity it means that for future 1015 weeks theres a set of predicted minimal amounts of players for each week that should be achieved this is based on collected statistics, but for the given task this is a strongknownstrong set.p  pSo far so good, the picture looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comanTOK.png altSample 1p  pWhile in the leftmost column there are numbers of people strongjoined the game each weekstrong, row of bold numbers under each week is the number of people strongpassed during this week to the next levelstrong.p  pHaving numbers of newcomers, the calculation of total resulting level ups for each week is trivial. The opposite is not at all such easy well, at least for me  and that IS the question stronghow to predict the required number of newcomers for each weekstrong leftmost column  to obtain the desired number of people who will pass to the next level during next weeks bold row in the bottomp  pI still cant find an appropriate and accurate solution for 2 weeks so far. I tried all possible options  from complex amp array formulas to Solver addin, but no luck I always have more unknowns than equations.

However, in case in January we actually got 80 new players each week  it means hard work for February For certainty checkpoint strongsubtotals are calculated every 10 weeksstrong. In any case, any low values must be compensated during several upcoming weeks.li liThe opposite is also true if we have strongmore newcomers than expectedstrong for the given week  we may attract less players during next weeks to meet the next subtotal goal.li listrongThe flow of players is infinitestrong  picture sample is given just for the purpose of clarity and better understanding.

Negative 49 pIm applying my limited Haskell knowledge to the Snap web framework and seeing what I can build. Im trying to get a possibly nonexistent parameter and parse it into an int. Obviously Maybe is what Ill be wanting.p  pIn the code below codeAppHandlercode is defined as codeHandler App Appcode a monad with two levels of state I think, although I cant find anything in the tutorial now. The codeB8code is codeByteString.Char8code and codereadIntcode returns codeMaybeInt,ByteStringcodep  pThe code below works, but presumably there should be a way to chain the maybe calls together via a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagesarchiveMaybeT0.1.2dochtmlControlMonadMaybe.html relnofollowMaybeTa presumably, since Im in a Monad already. The chaining makes particular sense because the next step will be to fetch a row from the database based on the parsed id, so of course that will return a Maybe a too. Clearly thats a pattern thats going to be very common.p  precode Given a parameter name, return the Int it points to  or Nothing if there is some problem maybeIntParam  ByteString gt AppHandler Maybe Int maybeIntParam pname  do     rawparam lt getParam pname     let mbib  maybe Nothing B8.readInt rawparam     case mbib of         Nothing    gt return Nothing         Just p, gt return  Just p codepre  pI tried applying runMaybeT but with no real understanding of what types need changing frankly I was making random changes in the hope the error goes away. It didnt, although it changed and moved around from line to line.p  pIm treating this as progress, since Im now completely lost at a much higher level than I was when I started exploring Haskell...p  hr  pstrongEditstrong walking through kosmikus answer, hopefully Ive understood it...p  precode1 maybeIntParam  ByteString gt AppHandler Maybe Int 2 maybeIntParam pname  do 3     rawparam lt getParam pname 4     return  do 5       param  lt rawparam 6       p,  lt B8.readInt param 7       return p codepre  pI think I was trying to inch towards this but kept trying to force codegetParamcode inside the same block as the other steps.p  pOn line 3, the call to getParam is taking place in the AppHandler. Weve got rawparam which is a codeMaybe ByteStringcode. On line 5 were in a nested do, so the binding is taking place inside the Maybe monad and codeparamcode will either be a codeByteStringcode or we get codeNothingcode and the rest of the doblock will shortcircuitsupsup. Likewise on line 6, p is either an Int or we shortcircuit.p  pAll being well, on line 6, codepcode contains an Int say 42, and line 7 will return codeJust 42code. Back at line 4 that becomes codeAppHandler Just 42code. Dont need to care what an AppHandler is at the moment  the types are all happy.p  pHere are some variations that also typecheck and may prove of use to those trying to think this through.p  precodemaybeIntParam1  ByteString gt AppHandler Maybe Int maybeIntParam1 pname  do     rawparam lt getParam pname     let mbintparam  do         param  lt rawparam         p,  lt B8.readInt param         return p     return mbintparam  maybeIntParam2  ByteString gt AppHandler Maybe Int maybeIntParam2 pname  do     return  return 27  maybeIntParam3  ByteString gt AppHandler Maybe Int maybeIntParam3 pname  do     return Just 27 codepre  pThe nondo variation actually seems simpler in this case. the only bit that needs thinking about is the codeltgtcode which if Im reading right is just codefmapcode and applies the codefstcode to codeMaybe Int,ByteStringcode so we can get codeMaybe Intcode.p  hr  psupsup If I understand correctly, each subsequent line must be visited but just returns Nothing, so not actually a gotostyle shortcut. strongEdit2strong see kosmikus comment below  laziness  rightnesting means we dont need to evaluate each line.p

Negative 49 pIm looking to support rendering SVG images as Bitmaps, Im using librsvg.  So far it works well and draws using Cairo, hooray  However Ive run into an issuep  pWe have a control that is similar to Windows Explorer, e.g. it creates thumbnailsized images of files in a directory, so the product would be extended to generate thumbnails of SVGs.p  pIt uses background threads to generate the thumbnail images so the UI isnt frozen as its working.  The code has been in production for a long time so no problem as far as concurrency issues go.  But it seems when rsvghandlenew is called from a thread other than the main thread an Access Violation occurs, when its not I have no issue working with librsvg.p  pLooking at the stack trace the crash appears to be occurring in libxml2 which is a dependency of librsvg at xmlSetGlobalState, the problem seems the same as reported here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3127472libxml2crashonseconduseonwindowslibxml2 crash on second use on Windowsa  which doesnt seem to have a resolution.  I would limit my use of the library to the main thread only if I could, but Im stuck with this existing architecture which produces the thumbnails off the main thread.p  pI found a hrefhttpwww.xmlsoft.orgthreads.html relnofollowhttpwww.xmlsoft.orgthreads.htmla which suggests calling xmlInitParser in the main thread first which seems to be called by librsvg during the RsvgHandle creation I think.p  pSo Im not sure if its really a libxml2 problem, a problem with the way librsvg is using libxml2, or a problem with the way Im trying to use librsvgp  pAny libxml2 or librsvg expertsp

Negative 49 pI am working on a POC for RabbitMQ for an M2M solution. I have a large number of physical devices that will be publishing data simulating clients using the Java client for now  eventually over MQTT. I want top  ol lisubscribe and journal all raw data to the databaseli lisubscribe to subsets of the data by data type so I can scale solutions for those types of data independentlyli lipublish new events through the exchange e.g. take a raw event, make it more useful and resubmit it through the systemli ol  pEach message has a routing key like keyvalue.keyvalue.keyvalue.messageType1 and data from the devices has an extra key of FROMDEVICE.MESSAGETYPE1.keyvalue... etc. The subscriber that saves the raw data from the device builds a queue from the exchange with the routing key .FROMDEVICE. case 1 above. The subscriber that takes a specific message type and valueadds it builds a queue with the routing key .MESSAGETYPE1. case 2 above and submits a new message to the same exchange removing FROMDEVICE from the routing key and replacing .MESSAGETYPE1 with .MESSAGETYPE101 case 3 above. There is then an independent subscriberqueue for the new message type.p  pEverything is fine except my subscriber that should only receive the data from the devices is also getting the value added data MESSAGETYPE101 even though the routingKey it should be searching for does not exist in the republishedvalueadded message.p  ul liFROMDEVICE.MESSAGETYPE1   ul lishould match routing key .FROMDEVICE.li lishould match .MESSAGETYPE1.li ulli liMESSAGETYPE101 ul lishould match routing key .MESSAGETYPE101.li lishould NOT match .FROMDEVICE. but doesli ulli ul  pCode to subscribe to data from devices onlyp  precodepublic class HandlerWriteEverythingFromDevice   private final static String EXCHANGENAME  logsTopicDurable private final static String QUEUENAME  fromDevice    Writes all data from device to a data store.   public static void mainString[] args throws java.io.IOException, java.lang.InterruptedException      ConnectionFactory factory  new ConnectionFactory     factory.setHost192.168.56.101     Connection connection  factory.newConnection     Channel channel  connection.createChannel      channel.exchangeDeclareEXCHANGENAME, topic, true     channel.queueDeclareQUEUENAME, true, false, false, null      System.out.println [] listens for messages from devices  durable      channel.basicQos1      String routingKey  .fromDevice..toUpperCase      channel.queueBindQUEUENAME, EXCHANGENAME, routingKey bind to all selected messages     System.out.println [] subscribing to   routingKey      System.out.println [] Waiting for messages.

Negative 49 pI am currently using an AWS micro instance as a web server for a website that allows users to upload photos. Two questionsp  p1 When looking at my CloudWatch metrics, I have recently noticed CPU spikes, the website receives very little traffic at the moment, but becomes utterly unusable during these spikes. These spikes can last several hours and resetting the server does not eliminate the spikes. p  p2 Although seemingly unrelated, whenever I post a link of my website on Twitter, the server crashes i.e.,Error Establishing a Database Connection. Once restarting Apache and MySQL, the website returns to normal functionality.p  pMy only guess would be that the issue is somehow the result of deficiencies with the micro instance. Unfortunately, when I upgraded to the small instance, the site was actually slower due to fact that the micro instances can have two EC2 compute units.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 49 pIm getting some odd behaviors loading breezejs in an application that also uses requirejs.p  pThe main issue is that if I setup require to load breeze plus its dependencies q and jquery, breeze fails to load unless knockout is setup as a dependency of breeze.  p  blockquote   pUncaught Error Module name ko has not been loaded yet for context   . Use require[]p blockquote  pThats fine if I actually wanted to use knockout, but Im using angular.  I guess it doesnt break anything to load knockout too, but its a waste of time to download if its never going to get used.p  pSo, my first question is why does breeze require knockout just because Im using requirejs  Seems like a bug to me.p  pThe other odd behavior WRT breeze and require is that if I load require and then breeze without using require, then breeze fails to load.  p  blockquote   pUncaught Error Mismatched anonymous define module...p blockquote  pSeems that breeze makes the assumption that if require is loaded, that breeze will be loaded by require.  But, this seems like a leap to assume.  I ran into this issue since I first discovered the previous issue.  I thought Id just load breeze myself instead of having require do it.  Of course, was still loading require since other parts of the app rely on require.  p  pSo, my second question is why does breeze have to be loaded before require  Just seems odd since the two libraries dont depend on each other.  Why is there a required load orderp

Negative 49 pIm building a custom content part that fetches its information from an external repository, mostly following the advice found  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4727843howtochangeorchardrecordrepository titleHow to change Orchard record repositoryHow to change Orchard record repositorya and using a custom handler to fetch the data.p  pWorking with external data stores opens up the possibility of all sorts of network exceptions, etc., which would cause the underlying record not be saved. However, if theres an exception thrown in the codeContentHandlercode, its swallowed up by the codeInvokeltTEventsgtcode method so that unless its a fatal exception the user wouldnt know about the exception and would be notified by the codeAdminControllercode that codeYour 0 has been saved.code, when in fact it hasnt been.p  pA workaround thats obvious to me is to intercept the error somehow and notify the content driver for my content part, which exposes the executing codeAdminControllercode. At that point, I can hook into the controllers codeModelStatecode and introduce an error, which would then be caught and then Id be notified of an error without any false positive notifications.p  pAre there any other extensibility points available in Orchard that would handle this kind of external access better than altering the controllers codeModelStatecode via a content driverp

Can anyone confirm, refute, andor explain My reasoning follows below.p  pMy test data is a count of patents issued to a firm in one technology class in each of 15 years.p  precodetestpats lt c2,1,2,0,1,4,1,1,2,4,2,6,1,3,3 codepre  pRunningp  precoderuns.testtestpats, plot.itT, alternativepositive.correlated codepre  pfirst of all, produces the following picture of the runs. wont let me post images so here is my recreation. p  precodeB B B B A B B B A A A B A A codepre  paccording to the documentation observations which are less than the sample median are represented by letter A, and observations which are greater or equal to the sample median are represented by letter B.p  pThe sample median of testpats is 2. So if the documentation were correct, the image should look likep  precode               B A B A A B A A B B B B A B B codepre  pClearly this is very different, so I have no idea what runs.test is using for the sample median.p  pSecond, the test statistic given by the function outputp  precode        Runs Test  Positive Correlated  data  testpats  Standardized Runs Statistic  0.4877, pvalue  0.3129 codepre  pIs very different from what I would calculate by hand using the methods described at a hrefhttpwww.itl.nist.govdiv898handbookedasection3eda35d.htm relnofollowhttpwww.itl.nist.govdiv898handbookedasection3eda35d.htma p  precodemymid lt mediantestpats runsdummy lt ifelsetestpats gt mymid, 1, 1 n1 lt lengthwhichrunsdummygt0 number of values above or equal to the median n2 lt lengthwhichrunsdummylt0 number of values below the median sr2 lt 2n1n22n1n2  n1  n2n1n22  n1n21 standard deviation of the number of runs Rbar lt 2n1n2n1n2  1 expected number of runs R lt 9 observed number of runs  how do I automate Z lt RRbarsr2 runs test statistics Z codepre  pgivesp  precode[1] 0.2508961 codepre  pNote that this hand calculated test statistic bears no resemblance to the 0.4877 provided by runs.test.p  pAlternately, I could use the small sample version of the test explained in a hrefhttpprojecteuclid.orgDPubSRepository1.0Disseminateviewbodyampidpdf1amphandleeuclid.aoms1177731494 relnofollowSwed and Eisenharta. The small sample method just uses the number of above and below observations and the number of runs.p  pGiven n1  5 n2  6 R  9p  pthe onesided pvalue should be 0.976.p  pAgain, this is not even close to the number produced by runs.testp  pSo, what gives Do I completely misunderstand how to use runs.test Ive tried using the function after transforming the data into abovebelow indicators e.g. 11, and I still get strange results.p
Negative 49 pI want to be able to easily set a benchmarking programs file write rate. Its a python program that Im using to test another system. Id like to be able to control the rate of file creation. One method I have thought of is to have a function with an argument for the number of files to create. This could be called in a loop which keeps track of the clock and only calls the function every second. This would fulfill the requirement of creating a certain number of files every second. The problem with this is that there could be a chunk of dead time milliseconds, but still. Id like a continuous load.p

The collision logic between the Ball and the two EdgeShapes works, but collision between the Ball and anything else in the Box2D world crashes the program.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6opFU.gif altenter image description herep  pThe stack trace p  precodeException in thread LWJGL Application java.lang.NullPointerException at com.ckq3r.Pong.screens.GameScreen2.beginContactGameScreen.java491 at com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d.World.beginContactWorld.java876 at com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d.World.jniStepNative Method at com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d.World.stepWorld.java602 at com.ckq3r.Pong.screens.GameScreen.renderGameScreen.java99 at com.badlogic.gdx.Game.renderGame.java46 at com.ckq3r.Pong.PongGame.renderPongGame.java236 at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication.mainLoopLwjglApplication.java204 at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication1.runLwjglApplication.java112 codepre  pThe problematic codep  precode    Box2D contact listener private void createContactListener      world.setContactListenernew ContactListener           Override         public void beginContactContact contact              Fixture fixtureA  contact.getFixtureA             Fixture fixtureB  contact.getFixtureB              Gdx.app.logbeginContact, between   fixtureA.toString   and   fixtureB.toString              iffixtureA.getBody.getUserData.equals1 ampamp fixtureB.getBody.getUserData.equals2  fixtureA.getBody.getUserData.equals2 ampamp fixtureB.getBody.getUserData.equals1                 Gdx.app.logHIT, goal1 contact                 score1                 score1String  score1                             iffixtureA.getBody.getUserData.equals1 ampamp fixtureB.getBody.getUserData.equals3  fixtureA.getBody.getUserData.equals3 ampamp fixtureB.getBody.getUserData.equals1                 Gdx.app.logHIT, goal2 contact                 score2                 score2String  score2                                  Override         public void endContactContact contact              Fixture fixtureA  contact.getFixtureA             Fixture fixtureB  contact.getFixtureB             Gdx.app.logendContact, between   fixtureA.toString   and   fixtureB.toString                   Override         public void preSolveContact contact, Manifold oldManifold                    Override         public void postSolveContact contact, ContactImpulse impulse                       codepre  pNotes p  ol liWhen I comment out the two conditional statements within the beginContact method, the code runs.

Negative 49 pWe need to assign a ADODB.RecordSet from our .NET class objects and I am not sure if I am doing it right. Lets say I have a List called orderList which consists of objects of class codeOrdercode, and I need to generate a RecordSet from this list I have adodb as reference. My code looks like thisp  precodeDim rs As Recordset  New Recordset rs.Fields.AppendID, DataTypeEnum.adInteger rs.Fields.AppendSender, DataTypeEnum.adBSTR rs.Fields.AppendReceiver, DataTypeEnum.adBSTR ... rs.Open  For Each o In orderList     rs.AddNew     rs.FieldsID.Value  o.ID     rs.FieldsSender.Value  o.Sender     rs.FieldsReceiver.Value  o.Receiver     ... Next codepre  pIn my test, when the list has 10000 objects, it takes relatively longt ime over 3 seconds. This is slow since the number of orders could be as even over a million. I doubt I am using the codeRecordSetcode properly because as far as I learned the codeRecordSetcode normally perform direct connection to a table. It doesnt feel right to assign the records one by one. But this is the only way I can come up with and some link suggests this. Although it doesnt mention about the performance there. We have our own Data Access Layer library and most of the target objects exist in the memory all the time, thats why we dont want to use RecordSet directly to database. p  pSo my question is, how should I modify my code to make it run fast The source doesnt necessarily need to be a codeListcode. It can be any .NET type. But the target is I must have a codeRecordSetcode object since thats the input requirement from another component.p

Negative 49 pOk heres the problem if you had some trouble understanding the title. Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comInferisViewDeck relnofollowthisa library here and it is represented by the codeIIViewDeckControllercode.p  pI init it with simple left and center codeUIViewControllerscode p  precodeFTPhoneHomeViewController home  [[FTPhoneHomeViewController alloc] init] FTPhoneSideViewController side  [[FTPhoneSideViewController alloc] init]  IIViewDeckController vdc  [[IIViewDeckController alloc] initWithCenterViewControllerhome leftViewControllerside] [self.delegate changeRootViewControllervdc] codepre  pcodeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode and codeFTPhoneSideViewControllercode are just subclasses of codeUIViewControllercode. The last line removes the current coderootViewControllercode from the window and adds the codeIIViewDeckControllercode.p  pNow in the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode I add another codeUIViewControllercode with the codeaddChildViewControllercode method p  precodeFTTileViewController tileViewController  [[FTTileViewController alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake5.0, 50.0, 469.0, 310 tileData[FTTileFaker prepareTileData] defaultTileConfig[FTTileFaker prepareTileConfigs][0] andTileConfigs[FTTileFaker prepareTileConfigs]] tileViewController.tileSpacing  9.0 [self addChildViewControllertileViewController] [self.view addSubviewtileViewController.view] [tileViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself] codepre  pI did this because this codeFTTileViewControllercode manages a bunch of tiles and from an architectural point of view, this logic is best contained in its own seperate codeUIViewControllercode.p  pWhen I use the codeIIViewDeckControllercode as a coderootViewControllercode from the window, my codeviewWillAppearcode event in the codeFTTileViewControllercode is not called. But it is called in the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode Now when I dont use the codeIIViewDeckControllercode and just add the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode as the coderootViewControllercode of the window, my codeFTTileViewControllercode does get the codeviewWillAppearcode event...p  pMaybe its a bug with the codeIIViewDeckControllercode and I should also post it there. But I dont see what Im doing wrong here. Anyone has any thoughts about thisp  pAnd if anyone could check my general assumption around codeUIViewControllerscode  p  pAdding codechildViewControllerscode to another codeUIViewControllercode is not a requirement to get view cycle methods like codeviewWillAppearcode to be passed onto another codeUIViewControllerscode view. These events are passed when you add another codeUIViewControllerscode view with the codeaddSubviewcode method. But you use the codeaddChildViewControllercode methods for example, to get rotation events and to maintain the codeviewControllerscode hierarchy through your application.p

All has been well. Today I got a new notebook with Windows 8 and IE 10 and am getting tons of javascipt errors. If I run it in IE 9 compatability mode via the developer console it works fine. Why is  it working in every browser except IE 10 Is this a common issue If it matters it seems to be an issue when both jQuery and the ASP.NET server control a hrefhttpwww.basicdatepicker.com relnofollowhttpwww.basicdatepicker.coma which appears to use this javascript library a hrefhttpwww.datejs.com relnofollowhttpwww.datejs.coma are on the same page being rendered.p  pIve been looking around the net and have noticed there are sites that says javascript is not enabled when I view them in IE 10.

Negative 49 pSo Im having a little issue in iOS 7 with something that was working pretty much fine in iOS 6 I know this gets said a lot but this one is just weird. So anyways, I have a Storyboard App and the TableView has some Prototype cells, one section has several labels and then a TextView for entering a response. Now in iOS6 when a user would click on the TextView the table would scroll to make room for the TextView to be seen above the keyboard, but now in iOS 6 and only on the 4s iphone since it has the smaller screen the keyboard slides up and the TableView only slides enough so that the whole TableViewCell is still visible which makes the TextView halfway behind the keyboard. This becomes troublesome because after typing in a single line of text the user has no idea of what else is being entered since the TextView is blocked by the keyboard. This is even worse on the first cell of the section since the TableView scrolls only enough to make the Cell and Header visible. I dont know if seeing the code would help but Ill post it below also by default the Cell is is only tall enough to display the labels and then when the user clicks on a cell the height is expanded on that cell to reveal the TextView and Buttons below the labels p  precodeif [indexPath section]  1          if [btrArray count] gt 0              BTRCustomCell btrCell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierBTRCell]                Check if BTR Row has been selected to expand View             if row  btrSelectedRow                  CGRect extended  btrCell.reasonLbl.frame                 extended.size.height  70                 btrCell.reasonLbl.frame  extended                 btrCell.responseTV.hidden  NO                 btrCell.ackButton.hidden  NO                 btrCell.replyButton.hidden  NO                          else                  CGRect normal  btrCell.reasonLbl.frame                 normal.size.height  30                 btrCell.reasonLbl.frame  normal                 btrCell.responseTV.hidden  YES                 btrCell.ackButton.hidden  YES                 btrCell.replyButton.hidden  YES               leaving out the lines that just add text to labels btrCell.responseTV.textColor  [UIColor lightGrayColor]             [[btrCell.responseTV layer] setBorderColor[[UIColor lightGrayColor] CGColor]]             [[btrCell.responseTV layer] setBorderWidth2.3]             [[btrCell.responseTV layer] setCornerRadius15]             btrCell.responseTV.tag  kBTRTextView  row             btrCell.responseTV.delegate  self              Add Keybar to TextView             UIToolbar keyBar  [[UIToolbar alloc] init]             [keyBar setTintColorMobileThemeColor]             [keyBar sizeToFit]              UIBarButtonItem flexButton  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItemUIBarButtonSystemItemFlexibleSpace targetself actionnil]             UIBarButtonItem doneButton  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItemUIBarButtonSystemItemDone targetself actionselectorresignKeyboard]             doneButton.tag  kBTRDoneButton  row             NSArray itemArray  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsflexButton, doneButton, nil]             [keyBar setItemsitemArray]              [btrCell.responseTV setInputAccessoryViewkeyBar]              Add Targets To Buttons             [btrCell.ackButton addTargetself actionselectorAcknowledgeButtonPressed forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]             btrCell.ackButton.tag  kBTRAckButton  row             [btrCell.replyButton addTargetself actionselectorReplyButtonPressed forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]             btrCell.replyButton.tag  kBTRReplyButton  row              return btrCell codepre  pIm not quite sure how to fix this or what is causing it. Im pretty much rewriting the app since the original was built back for iOS3 and then just minor updates were made to support iOS6, so ARC wasnt being used and neither was Storyboards and AutoLayouts which are pretty much a better way of working with an app and so this code was copied over right from the previous version to this one, but like I said it was pretty much working fine prior to iOS7. I dont know if its just part of the new behavior in iOS7 thats not scrolling the TableView all the way up to view the TextView or something I did wrong in the setup so any help would be great. p

Negative 49 pIm looking an efficient way to do this. A way that hopefully needs one string. I want the data presented like the followingp  prow1br  row2br  row3br  row4  p  pThe reason I want to try and use one string is because I may call the same query from different tables and it will have a different number of rows. One might have 10, the other 8. So I cant specifically use 8 strings when there might be a table of 10. p  pIs there a way I can do it so that it simply collects one columns worth of data then I can format it to be like abovep  pWhat I have at the moment does it but uses multiple strings.

Negative 49 pThis is a random one, so Ill try to get as clear as possible. I just burned about 3 hours trying to figure out whats going on and I cant even figure out where I should be looking.p  pWe used a method I found from you that will allow us to include JS files directly in one single Jade file. We use this as a sort of manifest for all of our vendor libraries and app source code. Essentially, it worked so that there is one big JS file serving up all of the application libraries and code. p  pHeres a little of that manifest, called codeapplicationjs.jadecodep  precodeinclude ....publicjavascriptslibmodernizr.min.js include ....publicjavascriptslibjquery.min.js include ....publicjavascriptslibprettydate.js include ....publicjavascriptslibjquery.easing.min.js include ....publicjavascriptslibjquery.isotope.min.js include ....publicjavascriptslibjquery.ui.1.9.2.min.js include ....publicjavascriptslibjquery.cookie.js codepre  p..and so on.p  pOur express app is set up to simply render this filep  precodeapp.getjavascriptsapplication.js, functionreq, res    return res.renderjsviewsapplicationjs  codepre  pWe recently updated a few packages and such, but Im confused because now, when we hit the url codedomain.comjavascriptsapplication.jscode each one of these include files is now strangely wrapped in a codeltscriptgtcode tag and pushed into the codeltheadgtcode of the document. Before, it would return a page of straight up javascript, which worked wonderfully.p  pI know this isnt really the best practice but its been on our production app for about 6 months now and is good enough...trust me, Id much rather see this thing in coderequire.jscodep  pLet me know if you need to see our codepackage.jsoncode file or anything else, happy to help.

Negative 49 pBefore submitting a form, i use javascript code surrounded in PHP in order to make locally some controls but sometimes javascript may not be enabled clientside.p  pThe fact is that I have to check by patternregex each control of the form for example checking email, phone number,.. format so that user cannot enter anything haphazardly.

I guess one more step would be to ask Windows API the user name. emUpdateem just did it, it also returns normunds. p  pAny ideas of how to approach this issuep  pEdited What I think is happening is that Domino runs servertasks as separate processes impersonating the user that the server has been started with. In this way it closes down access to remote resources that would have been available if it ran servertasks with delegation level of impersonation. p  pNow can this situation be changed by modifying some security policies or registry As far as I understand network access in this situation happens as NullSession anonymous user, so I assume one solution would be to enable share access by anonymous on remote end and allow NullSession to access this share locally. Edited does not seem to help either p  pOther, pretty wild solution, would be to log in from the agent using LogonUser Windows API to log in the same user again but with full rights not sure if this is feasible and even if it is, imo it means to store somewhere usernamepassword  And yes, it would limit us to the LotusScript solution, unless we want to install JNI wrapper all this should actually sit in XPage the agent is just an example of the problemp  pThird solution would be to use UNC pathes instead of mapped drives and access the path with appropriate usernamepassword or anonymously  allowing NullSession access, but this solution kind of beats my purpose to discover the mapped drives and do this or that depending on which ones are available.p

Negative 49 pIm looking for an algorithm to construct Boolean rules based on simplified input. What I basically want is to define the rules very shortly without getting into the if statements directly. Instead the algorithm should read in the input and construct the statements.p  pFor input I thought about using array structures as followingp  precodestruct Point      string Label     bool Activity   Point array[4]  array[0].Label  AB array[0].Activity  0  array[1].Label  CD array[1].Activity  1  array[2].Label  EF array[2].Activity  1  array[3].Label  GH array[3].Activity  0 codepre  pThe array contains the differen parameters together with their necessary Boolean value if 1, the parameter has to be true for the general statement to be true. If 0, it has to be false. This array structure could then be compared to the samples. The problem is that with this approach there is no way to use the operator or. I prefer not to use mulitple structures as this would again get pretty complicated for dozens of or constructs.p  pI also thought about using a .txtfile as input and importing it as one big string. The text in the file would be formattedwritten in such a way that I could work on it with pointers to extract the relevant operators and parameters. I would really prefer such an approach as I believe it could work much more efficiently. Because Im sort of new to programming and the especially the pointers in C I could not really think of a more elaborate beginning p  pI hope I could get my point across and that theres somebody able to help. p  pCheers, Zuupp  pEdit  What I am targeting to construct is a Boolean network every node consists of a Boolean value that and every connection describes a relationship. If parameter AB is true, parameter CD is false. If parameter AB and EF are true and CD is false, parameter GH is true.p  pThose relationships I described as Boolean rules. Those should somehow be created by my program.p

Negative 49 pIm trying to do text preprocessing on Tweets. What Im interested in is to match tokens from tweets text to that of a lookup table. For example I have a tabledictionary of sentiments words and I want to check if a tweet contains one of those words.p  pMy text preprocessing at the moment is the followingp  ol liStore the tweets text in a String.li liTokenize the text at whitespace characters codeString.split code and remove all numeric and weird characters tokens. Also I remove all mentions and stopwords. Then store the tokens in a String array.li ol  pThis approach leads to some problems and here is the explanationp  ul liOne straightforward approach is just to compare the tokens with the strings in the table and check if they match. That is okay but this leads to the next problem.li liI also want to check for if the text contains emoticons which are also stored in a dictionary. Now that I already removed all weird characters tokens, I cant simply do the previous comparisons approach. One could say ok, then just dont remove the numeric and weird characters tokens, but this leads to the following problem.li liI also want to cluster the text, so keeping the numeric tokens or urls is not an option since it screws the clustering quality.li liKeeping two versions of the tokens has a memory problem since everything is duplicated.li ul  pI was wondering if there is a way to match stuff that doesnt require duplicating stuff. Maybe using regexp

Negative 49 pHeres an odd issue I cant seem to find any information on. p  pIm working on an Android app with a friend who uses Eclipse  I use Ant and the Android commandline tools. Sometimes when I checkout code that was written by him and the project.properties file gets pulled into my local workspace, Ill have to change the path to the libraries back to where theyre at on my machine, as it gets automatically set for him via Eclipse. This may be of use to know in light of what just started happening when I try to launch monitor as Ive always done I get this error dialog box that pops up and says An error has occurred, please see the logfile homeuser.androidmonitorworkspace.metadata.logp  pSo I did. It was, after Id tried to launch monitor several times to no avail, a really long logcatlike file of Java traces. I cleared them out, thinking that perhaps it had run over its own max size for internal monitor data, but that didnt stop it crashing. A new set of errors just gets appended. p  pThis is the first time this has ever happened, and unlike essentially every other Android problem Ive had, I cant seem to find any existing information on it. The device monitor now seems to want to be integrated into Eclipse. I dont use Eclipse so Im not sure how the monitor runs within it, or whether Im correct in assuming that some configuration file somewhere needs to have a line changed or whatever.p  pHeres the content of the logfile a hrefhttppastebin.comJitCWrGg relnofollowhttppastebin.comJitCWrGgap  pCould anyone lend a word of advicep  pMany thanksp

The app currently references images and fonts hosted on an external server.

Some of it seems outdated, and either very sketchy or unfocused on the particular issues I need to work out.p  pThanksp

My first problem is that when you click on that button, the footer should double in size because the edit button then becomes an add button and a done button, instead of just one button. What would be the best way to make the size of the footer bigger. I have tried changing the frame of the footer through codeself.tableView.tableFooterView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 320, 88code but this does not work.p  pMy second problem is that I would like the footer to always scroll with the table, like it is just another cell. It should just be located at the bottom of the table no matter what. If the user scrolls down, it should not stop at the bottom of the screen and stick, it should just keep scrolling with the rest of tableview. How would I fix thisp  pHere is how I am creating the footerp  precode CGFloattableViewUITableView tableView heightForFooterInSectionNSIntegersection      return 48    UIView tableViewUITableView

Negative 49 pIve got problem with version of dependency that I set manually.br  Note I use bAutomatic restoreb within Visual Studio.brbr When I set Version1.3.12.5 for my dependency in packages.config I expect that restore will install package and it will be referenced in next build I trigger. But it is not true. Package is installed and placed in packages directory but build does not use this downloaded packages as csproj is not changed automatically.p  pDo you know possible scenarios to workaround this problemp  pI tried to use Proget Client Tools but it turned out that it is not possible to use local directory feed with this. I need local and remote feeds support also, so it is additional requirement.p  pSo, paraphrasing my question is... How to easily change referenced version of package without touching csproj which is hard to edit in visual studio Editing version twice one in packages.config, two in csproj is also an overkill.p

Negative 49 pIm pretty new to both PHP and MySQL and Im trying to build a small library of singers  quotes. Id like the user to be able to search for a quote by typing a part of the quote itself, the singers name or the singers band, if any.p  pNow, that part I pretty much nailedp  precodequery  SELECT  FROM quotes WHERE quote LIKE .searchstring. OR singerName LIKE .searchstring. OR bandName LIKE .searchstring. codepre  pThis works, although it alors returns results where the searchstring is in the middle of a word if I type her, it will return every quote containing other or together. If I drop the second  from the query, it wont return quotes where the searchstring isnt the very first word, which I want it to do.p  pAnyway, what Id also like to do is give the possibility to filter the results. Lets say I want the user to be able to only show quotes in English, German or Both, via radio buttons. By default, Both is selected, so the query above is still valid. However, if the user selects English, it should also say something like codeAND language  ENcode.p  pFor now, I tried adding to the query this wayp  precodeif POST[language] EN    sql .  AND language  EN  codepre  pIt works, but it can be a real hassle, as I also want the user to search for quotes using only the filters, without entering a search query they would be able to look for quotes in English by singers in Band, for example. So, I also have thisp  precodeif strlensearchstring lt 1    sql  SELECT  FROM quotes  codepre  pBut then, the codesql .  AND language  ENcode wouldnt be correct anymore, as AND should be WHERE. So Ill have to have another if clause to modify the string, and another one for every filter I decide to apply.p  pMy question is then how should I build my query, given that there are emoptionalem filters, and that the search should also be possible using the filters emaloneemp  pThanksp

Negative 49 pHaving some issues with certain parts of my Parallax Scrolling in my website and not sure why, heres the link to the website. The parallax Ill attach show screenshots to show what I mean, the Lift and the Gillons are the only one which correctly show up the same in both FireFox and Chrome the rest are way off when fully in browser. FireFox shows correctly and funny thing is if you open the files offline from the desktop in Chrome they show up correctly but when on the web files open totally different... I put code below all the Screenshots for HTML and CSS... I only put some of the HTML just related to those sections. Theres other CSS files but dont think they are effecting it, I believe has something to do with starting points but not sure, any help would be much appreciated.p  pThis is the link incase anyone needs to see how it works...p  pa hrefhttpmodocom.camodoupdate relnofollowa hrefhttpmodocom.camodoupdate relnofollowhttpmodocom.camodoupdateaa p  pFireFoxp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwSydU.jpg

Negative 49 pI would like to know which approach to take to prevent Hibernate 4.3.4 with Spring and Hibernate Vaidator from flushing dirty entities.  In my code, i use a manual implementation of Hibernate Validator a .validate method within the instance itself, which gets called just before saving an entity. The validate method returns a list of errors, if any are found, otherwise a Session.update is called to store the entity, followed by a commit of the transaction. p  pThis works, but when the instance itself is manipulated posted request parameters are set in the entity the entity and corresponding Hibernate session are marked dirty and the entity is stored with the next Session.flush. p  pIn my case, i would like to have explicit control over the entities which may be stored and prevent any dirty entity from being stored, how would i achieve this p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI know i can manually regulate this by evicting an entity or clearing and reintroducing an entity via a merge, but this is not my aim. Rather than having to regulate the persistency manually, i would like to have the offset situation that no entity which was not explicitly saved and of which the transaction was not explicitly committed, will not get stored to the database e.g. via an interceptor.p

Negative 49 pI am building a Ruby on Rails 4.1 app that has the following models that should make sense when you see the model namesp  pDomains, Teams, Users, Meetings etcp  pNow, a Team belongs to a domain and a User to a team, also meetings belong to a user. A domain is simply an organisation or company that is using the software.p  pAfter the creation of an admin user that user has to initially create a Domain, then create the first team, then other users can sign up.p  pAs you can probably anticipate, in the process of creating the initial Domain and Team which is done in the newcreate of the Team and Domain controllers I am having to access and change references in all three. So, for example, creating the first Domain will have to associate the admin user, creating a Team will involve linking it to the user, then also the parent domain.p  pSo, its all getting a bit mixed up, with the controller needing to access several models.p  pMy question is, where does this logic belong In the spirit of thin controller you would normally farm it out to the model, but it involves more than one model. Is this where the new Rails 4 concerns become useful or should I just put it in the controllerp  pI am relatively new to rails, so please keep that in mind if you are kind enough to reply  thanksp

Negative 49 pI just am trying to replicate my distributed C project structure to WIX setup projects. Now there is the following problemp  pstrongLIBstrong a C library solution that builds AnyCPU .NET dlls from several C projectsp  pstrongAPPstrong the dlls from LIB are referenced as file references by this main application solution. Additionally there are platform dependent libs included in this application solution, therefore it is important to being able to create setups for the two specific target platforms x86 and x64.p  pNow I started to create a wixsetup project within the APP solution which works fine. Then I proceeded with creating a wixlib within the LIB solution that references the LIB .NET dlls into the wixlib.p  pstrongNow the problemstrongp  pThe wixlib references the AnyCPU .NET dlls within a DirectoryRef which seems to be platform specificly tagged when creating the wixlib. Therefore I have to go back to the LIB solution, build the project with one platform target, copy the built files via SVN externals mechanisms to the APP solution, build this project with the exact same target platform as the wixlib was created with and repeat this procedure for creating the other platform.p  pIt may seem that this is kind of complicated, but doable. Due to the fact that I omitted several other library solutions for which the same problem applies and the fact that all those libraries are used in multiple application solutions and  finally  everything has to run on our build server automatically as well, it is clear that this will not work.p  pstrongI know of the following solution, thoughstrongp  pDouble the .NET dll references within wixlib to assign them to different DirectoryRef INSTALLDIR and INSTALLDIR32 e. g. and to implement those different directory references in the wixsetup. But this would complicate things as well and is not my preferred solution therefore  if there is an alternative.p  pIf there is no smart alternative, just tell me and I will do things as described in the last paragraph.p

Negative 49 pIm creating a C program that uses RapidXML to read data from xml files. Because RapidXML allocates pointers to the xml content to be used to access it, it needs the content of the file to live on as long as it is parsed in further steps.p  pSo I had several files parsed successfully, but at the beginning of every parsing of a file, I always had all of the ifstream and allocating going on. I came up with the idea to create a function that would take in the file path, pointers to the xmldocumentlt instance and so on and return the root node of the xml file. What I then realised was, that I might hit scope problems with the  dynamically allocated char array containing the xml content to be parsed and later pointed to.p  pI then tried the following technique, where I allocated a char, xmldocument and xmlnode and invoked the function to retrieve the root node.p  pThe functionp  precodebool readXMLconst char  path, char  buffer, xmldocumentltgt  doc, const char  rootNodeName, xmlnodeltgt  rootnode  Open file     ifstream filepath, iosiniosbinary     if file.isopen   errERRFILENOTFOUND,path    return 0     Get length     file.seekg0,file.end     int length  file.tellg     file.seekg0,file.beg  Allocate buffer     buffer  new char [length1]     file.readbuffer,length     buffer[length]  0     file.close  Parse     docgtparselt0gtbuffer   Get root node     rootnode  docgtfirstnoderootNodeName     if  rootnode   errERRFILEINVALID,path return 0      return 1  codepre  pThe code where I use the function reading Hersteller.xml  initializing classp  precodebool loadHersteller  v4      Declare     char  bfr     xmldocumentltgt doc     xmlnodeltgt  rtnode       Get root node     if readXMLconcatURLPFADDATEN,Hersteller.xml, bfr, ampdoc, Hersteller, rtnode return 0       Extract     if initHRSTrtnode return 0  Works fine on its own initializes a class     toConsoleHrst  Works fine on its own prints data back to console       Clean up     delete[] bfr     doc.clear     return 1   END loadHersteller codepre  pNow what I get from that is a blank console and a crash with it, returning an interger. I am very certain that the problem is the scope or lifetime of the char array. The goal of this function is to do all the work of retrieving xml files  allocating the buffer for me and passing me the root node which Ill right pass to another function. As said, the char array needs to stay alive in the scope where the function was invoked from, so it can be accessed via the pointer structure built by the parser.p

Negative 49 pMy goal is to create a function that uses the list monad inside either a ReaderT WriterT stack, or a RWS stack. More generally, how do I use the list monad inside mtl typeclasses such as MonadReader, MonadWriterp  pWhy am I trying to do this This problem is an exercise in a hrefhttpwww.apress.com9781430262503 relnofollowBeginning Haskella. It asks me to use functionality from both MonadReader and MonadWriter wrapping the base list monad. To check that the function is general, use two different monads to [test] the requested functionality codeReaderT r WriterT w [] acode and codeRWST r w s m acode  So the book implies this is possible.p  pI cant figure out how to tell the compiler to use the list monad.

My best attempt so far looks something like codepathImplicitStack  MonadReader [Int, Int] m, MonadWriter [Int] m, MonadPlus m gt Int gt Int gt m code  I know this isnt right, the list monad is probably missing. Also, I think MonadPlus might be useful in the type signature, but Im not quite sure.p  pThis line codedo  s0, e0 lt ask gtgt liftcode is the one giving me trouble.

Negative 49 pI currently have a structure that declares a copy constructor, and a destructor, and keeps a reference count to a pimpl object. This allows me to pass this structure around by value. I need to refactor it because I want it to have a POD interface because its part of a library that now needs to be used from code that uses an older C flavor. Because of this, I have to remove both the copy constructor and the desctructor. I cant figure out how I can keep this nice pass by value, multiple ownership mechanism after I have removed that. Shared pointers are not an option because the structure is used as parameter to the method of other classes that also need to be seen as POD from the perspective of the user of the library.p  precodestruct Foo    Fooconst Fooamp   const Fooamp operatorconst Fooamp    Foo private   void pimpl   struct MainLibrary     void DoSomethingFoo param  codepre  pThe user code now is likep  precodeMainLibrary ml    Foo a   ml.doSomethinga  codepre  pat this point, the a variable can be kept for a long time inside the main library. For efficiency, the internals of Foo cant be deep copied each time, thats why the pimpl implementation keeps a reference counter that is incremented each time the instance of Foo is copied, decremented each time the instance of Foo is destroyed.p

Negative 49 pI have a strange issue which I have not seen before when using the WCFSQL adapter on a set of receive locations.p  pThe set up is one receive port in BizTalk 2010 with 3 separate receive locations. Each receive location calls the same stored procedure with a different parameter and execute statement looks like thisp  precodeEXEC dbo.StoredProc WELLNESS EXEC dbo.StoredProc DIABETES EXEC dbo.StoredProc SCREENINGS codepre  pThe stored proc works exactly as expected when passing the parameters and returns XML using FOR XML PATH. Everything here works fine.p  pThe issue I am running into seems to be in regards to the pollDataAvailableStatement in these receive locations. No matter what I do all 3 return a 1 to BizTalk which kicks off all 3 processes. The polling statements are as followsp  precodeSELECT Count1 FROM XXX.XXXXTable WHERE FileType  TP  GAPS IN CARE DIABETES AND FileStatus  READY SELECT Count1 FROM XXX.XXXXTable WHERE FileType  TP  GAPS IN CARE WELLNESS AND FileStatus  READY SELECT Count1 FROM XXX.XXXXTable WHERE FileType  TP  GAPS IN CARE SCREENINGS AND FileStatus  READY codepre  pSo when I set the flags appropriately in the table its polling to see if it should run and returning true to execute the stored proc. Even if I only set the flag for the WELLNESS receive location in the database the polling statement returns true for all 3 and I am baffled as to why. Ive never run into this before and I am using the same exact setup in many other BizTalk applications with no issue.p  pOther pieces of information, I am using XmlPolling. Ive tried to set the pollWhileDataFound to both True and False and notice the same behavior. The polling interval is 600 seconds Ive also tried 3600 seconds. And all the SQL timeouts are 40 minutes.p

Negative 49 pI was wondering about the best way to deliver private web service instances to lots of users, so the user would always be able to connect to their own offline version of a service, just like running a web service from visual studios while debugging. I was struggling with setting this up in VS2013 even with the many online tutorials, but I am not sure if its not working because it was never supposed to work this way.p  pI have provided this indepth explanation of my issue as i am not sure i am going about this in the right way and would appreciate feedbackp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a web service to interface with an engine. This deals with the frontend and builds a set of commands for how to make a CAD model. These commands are for controlling the 3rd party CAD softwares API. Therefore the engine can be seen to have two main functions  p  ol lipBuild the CADs API instructions, which can be saved for later pli lipExecution, where it strongcatches the instance of the CAD software     running on the same computerstrong and it builds the model.pli ol  pThe second part is restricted for the general public. Only our inhouse users should be able to use it. However, they want to have an otherwise identical frontend and user experience.p  pThe problem is, if they connect to the same engine as the public, which exists on our main server, then the engine will be looking for an instance of the CAD package on the emsame machine as itselfem  i.e the server, as stressed in the emboldened point above. What should happen is the engine finds the CAD  instance running on the machine that the controlling UI is based on and it uses that for its target. I have spoke to the CAD API support and they say they do not know how to do that.p  pAnd so we get to my solution of providing an offline stand alone of my web service on each of the employees computers. This means the frontend will check at the start of the session if a localhost connection is available. If not it will use the main address, which takes it to my server. Otherwise it uses the local engine which will look perform the default behavior of looking for a CAD package on the same machine as itself. Because its locally installed that is now the right machine and it will find the CAD instance of the user successfully.p  pstrongFinal pointsstrongp  ul liThe engine cannot be accessed by the UI directly as i am using Unity3D for the frontend and there is .Net compatibility issues. li liI need a completely self contained version of the software in thebr future anyway, so eventually i have to deal with having the enginebr accessed locallyli ul

Negative 49 peveryonep  pIm trying to add an item in every page of my application in oracle APEX. As there are many pages in my application, for convenience, I created a Global Page, and added a region in which the item was created. Although, this can meet my requirement of adding an page item in every page, but it will lead to an unnecessary region display in every page.p  pI also tried to create an item plugin in shared components, and tried to add the plugin in Global Page. However, when I tried to add an plugin type region, apex told me that there is no plugin installed.

Negative 49 pI have a simple stored procedure that returns a Description and a Name when you give it a ID.  I need to enable this inline in multiple Excel Sheets.  Something like codeItemLookup12345code that would then return the aforementioned info.p  pI have not done a lot with Excel programming and am simply wondering what my options are for tackling this.  Is this a VBA thing or should this be an external DLL that I COM register  Both felt like overkill but then I realized I had no idea if they were.  I really wanted to use VSTO for this but it sounds like that is not possible for Cell level UDFs without having to modifiy each Workbook with some VBA.p

Negative 49 pThis has been asked before with no responses, so I will try to phrase the question  a bit differently. What are the various ways to pass some data to an Android codeServicecode without being able to bind to it or start it myselfp  pHeres the issue  I have a codeHostApduServicecode that is started by the operating system on every NFC card transaction. It requires the permission codeandroid.permission.BINDNFCSERVICEcode, which is a system permission, so my application cant bind to it. I dont want to leave data at rest so anything that gets written to the disk is a nogo. I thought of a few possible solutions, but they are either messy or insecurep  ol liPut the data in our apps SharedPreferences. This presents a DAR issue.li liBroadcast information to the codeServicecode. The codeHostApduServicecode runs for the duration of the card transaction, so I cant reliably time the broadcast to reach the service before it starts working.li liPut the information I want to pass in into a codestaticcode field somewhere. This is messy and could potentially cause concurrency issues, but is what Im currently using.li ol  pAny other ideas Thanks in advance.p

Negative 49 pI have several 3rd party DLLs which are super flaky. They can sometimes hang and never return or sometimes throw weird exceptions which can bring down the whole process.p  pI want to move these DLLs and load then in a separate Child process. That way instead of having to do nasty Thread.Abort I can just bring down the process cleanly and later respawn it when required.p  pSo my parent application receives a list of files that need to be processed by certain third party DLLs. I essentially need to pass these to the new child process, let it process the file and then communicate back to the parent that it was successful. I must also be able to bring down the process if sht hits the fan and respawn. These files come as constant stream so spawning a process everytime i get a file is not possible, id want it to hang around and just accept requests. p  pRight now im spawning the child process from the parent and then attempting to use Memory Mapped Files to share the fileswork. Would it be easier just passing the location of said file and somehow getting a response when its processedp  pWhat would be a good strategy here...p

Negative 49 pI am looking for a fast and efficient way to compute the problem described below. Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advancep  pI have a couple of very large csv files that have different information about the same object, but in my final calculation I need all of the attributes in the different table. I am trying to calculate the load of a large number of electrical substations, first I have a list of unique electrical substationsp  precodeUniqueSubstations lt data.frameName  cSubA, SubB, SubC, SubD codepre  pIn another list I have information about the customers behind these substationsp  precodeCustomerInformation lt data.frame   Customer  10011010,    SubStNm  sampleuniqueUniqueSubstationsName, 10, replace  TRUE,    HouseHoldType  sample12, 10, replace  TRUE  codepre  pAnd in another list I have information about the, lets say, solar panels on these customers roofs for different yearsp  precodeSolarPanels lt data.frame   Customer  sample10011010, 10, replace  TRUE,    SolarPanelYear1  sample1020, 10, replace  TRUE,    SolarPanelYear2  sample1520, 10, replace  TRUE  codepre  pNow I want see what the load is for each substation for each year. I have a household load and a solar panel load normalised for each type of household or the solarpanelp  precodeSolarLoad lt data.frameLoad  c0, 10, 10, 5 HouseHoldLoad lt data.frameType1  c1, 3, 5, 2, Type2  c3, 5, 6, 1 codepre  pSo now I have to match up these listsp  precodeMLSubStCust lt sapplyUniqueSubstationsName,                          functionx whichCustomerInformationSubStNm in x  TRUE  MLCustSolarP lt sapplyCustomerInformationCustomer,                           functionx whichSolarPanelsCustomer in x  TRUE codepre  pHere I use the codewhichxxx in x  TRUEcode method because I need multiple matches and codematchcode only returns one matchp  pAnd now we come to my big question but probably not my only problem with this method at last. I want to calculate the maximum load on each substation for each year. To this end I had first written a for loop that looped through the UniqueSubstations list, which is of course highly inefficient. After that I tried to speed it up using codeoutercode but I dont think I have properly vectorized my function. My maximum function looks as follows I only wrote it out for the solar panel part to keep it simplep  precodeGetMax lt functioni, Yr    maxsumSolarPanels[unlistMLCustSolarP[MLSubStCust[[i]]], use.names FALSE,Yr]SolarLoad  codepre  pIm sure this is not efficient at all but I have no clue how to do it in any other way. p  pTo get my final results I use a outer functionp  precodeResults lt outer1nrowUniqueSubstations, 12, VectorizeGetMax codepre  pIn my example all of these data frames are much much larger 40000 rows each or so, so I really need some good optimization of the functions involved. I tried to think of ways to vectorize the function but I couldnt work it out. Any help would be appreciated.p  pEDITp  pNow that I fully understand the accepted awnser I have another problem. My actual codeCustomerInformationcode is 188k rows long and my actual codeHouseHoldLoadcode is 53k rows long. Needless to say this does not codemergecode very well. Is there another solution to this problem that does not require codemergecode or for loops that are too slowp

Negative 49 pI am trying to put together a query to fetch data for a report.p  pI am not a newcomer to SQL, but I will admit that I really only make very light use of it. I have a small bag of tricks which I manage to make go a long way.p  pI have a feeling that I might be needing a nested query to accomplish my goal this time, which  I have never attempted to use before.p  pThis is an extremely simplified version of my problem.p  pI have 2 tables codeemployeeheadercode and codeemployeedetailscode.p  pThe is a one to many relationship between these tables 1 header to many detailsp  pThe header contains contact information about the employee, one row per employee, each employee with an codeidcode  the primary key.p  pThe details table contains multiple rows per employee, each representing a record of a codetrainingtypecode achieved by the employee. Each row references the employees codeidcode from the header table.p  pMy goal is to SELECT a list of employees and their training types WHERE the employee has multiple codetrainingtypescode... i.e. the employee has both trainingtype1 and traingtype2p  pI guess the thing thats tripping me up is that there can be an arbitrary number of training types, so instead of each training type having its own column, they instead have their own row.p  pIve tried to make my problem as clear as possible, and simplify it enough to make it attainable... the truth is that its actually one part of a much more complex preexisting query that also performs several date operations on the detail row to see whether the training is valid, expired, or archived an expired training item that has been reattained since expiry.

But I still dont understand how to call this, although Ive tried many different methods.p  pThis is my codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  enum playerposition GoalKeeper, Midfielder, Defender, Striker   class FootballPlayer  private     string Name     int Age     int Points     playerposition Ppos  public     FootballPlayerstring name  aname, int age  20, int points  50, playerposition ppos  Striker              Name  name         Age  age         Points  points         Ppos  ppos           FootballPlayerstring str[4]     lt This Constructor is the one , i cant seem to call into the main.              cin gtgt str[0]         Name  str[0]         cout ltlt Name         cout ltlt str[0]         int a  atoistr[1].cstr         cout ltlt a         int b  atoistr[2].cstr         cout ltlt b         str[3]  Ppos        int main        Please dont take any of the info as biased, these are just random.

Negative 49 pOK. I have searched for days for a suitable answer to my question, but I cannot find a relevant answer. Its possible that I have overlooked many things, but I am basically new to coding 1 month. p  pI am working on an Angular  FirebaseAngularfire project that requires a todo app. It sounds fairly simple, but I am adding some extra features to it. One of the features that I have been having trouble with is filtering todos that are unfinished and those that are finished from one template to another. p  pWhat I would like to do is move all the todos that are marked done, when clicked, to another table in another template view. So far, Ive written 3 HTML templates home where the todos are entered, completed, and expired I am still working on this one, which is another issue. All of the templates are working when changing views using codeuiviewcode and a navigation button. p  pAt the moment of the templates contain the same HTML table, so, of course, I am getting the same data in the tables when the data is placed in the home template.

Negative 49 pBasically, the problem is simple. I want to manipulate a file which is in a strange encoding settings file for a program Im using. I can manipulate it by hand using Notepad such that what I want to happen happens. However, the file is full of NUL bytes, and R does not approve.p  pUsing hexView I am able to read the file as hexadecimals, however, I am unable to export it or manipulate the file such that the necessary byteshexas are changed. Are there any methods around this or am I destined to write my own package to do thisp

Negative 49 pHTML5 introduced a variety of new semantic tags such as codeltheadergtcode, codeltfootergtcode and codeltarticlegtcode to replace codedivcodes and similar generic tags where appropriate. This seems like a good thing.p  pIve been experimenting with Polymer, and the Web Components spec seems like the future, albeit a little ahead of its time. In particular, its custom tag names and ability to separate data from layout makes pages of HTML extremely semantic and readable.p  pThe components have codetemplatecodes that form the shadow DOM, and the templates are populated using codecontentcode tags that codeselectcode data elements based on their tag names. Putting HTML5s semantic tags and codeltcontentgtcode tags together seems like a nobrainer, distributing uniquelynamed elements rather than trying to insert three codeltdivgtcodes in three different places and relying on declaration order.p  pIn particular, it would be great if we could use custom semantic tags for data, and use those semantic names for selection. For example, a name card component could have codeltcontentgtcode tags that select data elements such as codeltnamegtcode and codeltdescriptiongtcode rather than using attributes.p  pHowever, codeltnamegtcode and codeltdescriptiongtcode are not valid tags in HTML5. Browsers treat all unrecognised tags as codeltspangtcode elements, so there would be no implementation problems with allowing custom tags in the DOM. They would carry additional semantic information for readers of the code, and potentially search engine crawlers as well. Code might be less consistent, but arguably better.p  pIf this is too vague a question, Ill make it explicit is there a definitive reason why tags such as codeltnamegtcode are not valid HTML5p  pstrongEDITstrong I just tested the codeltcontentgtcode selection, and verified that you can in fact use selectors other than just tag name in the codeselectcode attribute. I hadnt seen this in any tutorials, but it mostly satisfies my practical desire for semantic tags. For my example, you could instead use codeltcontent selectp.namegtcode and codeltcontent selectp.descriptiongtcode.p  pIm still interested from a theoretical perspective, however.p

Negative 49 pOnce again I started to experiment with Android things. Im trying to create a small simple game, which uses a hexagonal board. I know the math behind the hexagonal calculations, but the problem is how to actually implement such board in Androidp  pAt first I thought of using a grid view where every other line is displaced by half step and then use these square grids as my board and just draw a hexagonal shape over the square boxes. However, the regular grid view doesnt seem to allow me to do that.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyfBCV.png altDisplaced square gridp  pSo I thought that maybe I need to create a custom view with either hexagonal grid or a custom view with square displaced grid.p  pIm not familiar with Android custom views.

Negative 49 pI recently had a task to iterate over a big table 40KK records in PostgreSQL using Propel and encountered performance issues, both memory limit and execution speed. My script had been running for 22 hours.p  pThe task was to retrieve records based on some criteria not active for the last 6 months and archive them move to another table and all related entities from other tables.p  pThe primary table, my script is working on, has several columns codeidcode, codedeviceidcode, codeapplicationidcode, codelastactivitydatecode and others, that dont have any significant meaning here. This table contains information about applications installed on device and their last activity dates. There may be several records with the same codedeviceidcode and different codeapplicationidcode. Here is a sample from the tablep  precode     id     deviceid  applicationid    lastinitdate            1          1               1  20130924 170901          2          1               2  20130919 203623          3          1               3  20140211 000000          4          2               4  20130929 201254          5          3               5  20130831 194105 codepre  pSo, the device is considered to be old enough to be archived, if the maximum codelastactivitydatecode for the particular codedeviceidcode in this table is older than 6 months.

Well im a fresh dude in the field of javascript and node.js and heres my problemp  pIve created an application based on the tutorial of socket.io  Heres the link to the completed project of their a hrefhttpsgithub.comrauchgchatexample relnofollowchat example.a everything is working as it should, but I would really need to trigger somekind of a command while node server is running... command should be triggered via strongphpstrong script. p  pThe command should trigger an emit event  so every client in our case would see a new message sent via php.p  pI saw couple of suggestions to do it from another server with phpusing strongcURLstrong. The problem is that I dont know how to fetch POST data sent from php to node.js server.p  pAny solution to command node with php is more than welcome and again im sorry to bother you  p

Negative 49 pA God Namespace is the uncommon term for an antipattern analogous to the God Object, when you stuff a metric ton of stuff mostly methodsfunctions that is not related or not closely related to each other into one huge namespacecodestatic classcode just so that it can be used in multiple sections of your project.p  pWhen following that antipattern, you often end up, as a C example, with something like a codestatic class Assetscode with tons of methods mostly unrelated to each other, but used across multiple places in your projects.p  pI usually approach this problem by letting the next codeAssetscode grow for as much as I can bear it, and then desperately try to sort its contents out into several smaller ones based on the criteria which seems most legit, like codeMathAssetscode, or codeBitmapAssetscode, or codeRNGAssetscode, and then end up forgetting what did I put where... and make a new codeAssetscode for several new methods which dont fit into either of the codeSomethingAssetscode already cluttering up the project.p  pAre there any other ways of clearing up the God Namespace Or will I just have to live with good old codestatic class Assetscodep

Negative 49 pIm debugging a codeUITextViewcode which logs my operation.p  pe.g. If I press a special button on the screen, this codeUITextViewcode will show which button I just pressed. It will log more as I pressed more buttons, so I can easily scroll the codeUITextViewcode to see my past operation.p  pBecause the codeUITextViewcode itself doesnt scroll with increasing text, so I try to make it scroll to the last line when something is logged into it. I try to use the strongscrollRangeToVisiblestrong method belowp  precodehistory.scrollRangeToVisibleNSMakeRangecounthistory.text  1, 1 codepre  pHere history is a codeUITextViewcode outlet.p  pThe problem is, this method always makes the codeUITextViewcode to scroll from the beginning to the designated codeNSRangecode. More specifically, it will reset the view to the beginning of the text and then scroll down to wherever the codeNSRangecode is. I want it to codescrollcode directly down, p  pCan someone solve this problem Thanks a lot.p

Negative 49 pI have angular application, and first thing to note is that it recently had its build process moved not by me from grunt to gulp. I suspect that when his happened, something was lost in the build process, but I am at my wits end figuring out what.p  pIn the old version of the app, I could run the following code from the JS consolep  precodevar app  angular.elementdocument.querySelector[ngapp], [datangapp] var injector  app.injector codepre  pAnd what I got back was an injector object. However, now that we are using gulp instead , the variable injector is now set to undefined. The app variable is fine, it finds my app instance, and it has an injector method, and it does not error, it just returns an empty value. p  pIf it helps, were using ngannotate and uglify to set up dependency inject and minify the code  but I can take both lines out, and do nothing but concat the code, and I still get the same result. p  pHeres the kicker the application itself still seems at first blush to work fine. I only discovered this quirk because Im using the capybaraangular gem in our test process, with selenium, and the selenium chrome driver keeps erring out because it is trying to create an injector using the aforementioned code.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how I might debug thisp

Negative 49 pIm having a problem, and Im not sure if it is lack of understanding on my part, something that Web API 2 cannot do. Im not really versed in XSD validation yet.p  pIm building a Web API project used by clients to get information on people. To make communication with consumers of the API easier, the XML response of the API must validate according to a set of XSDdocuments One main XSD that imports other XSDs for the complex properties on the Person object.p  pI believe the problem lies in the multiple namespaces that are defined in the main XSD for the complex properties, that I cannot get the Web API to create in its response. Specifically the error in validation is codeThe element person in namespace httpurl.comperson has invalid child element address in namespace httpurl.comperson. List of possible elements expected element1 in namespace httpurl.comobject as well as address in namespace httpurl.comaddress.codep  pIt basically says the node Address is invalid in namespace1, but finds it in namespace2.p  pConcrete example The database holds people, and every person has an address as a complex property. The XSD looks something like thisp  precode  ltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema  xmlnsaddresshttpurl.comaddress targetNamespacehttpurl.comperson elementFormDefaultqualified attributeFormDefaultunqualifiedgt     ltxsimport namespacehttpurl.comaddress schemaLocationAdresses API 0.2.xsdgt ltxscomplexType namePersongt         ltxscomplexContentgt             ltxsextension basepartyIndividualgt                 ltxssequencegt                     ltxselement namename typexsstring nillabletrue minOccurs0gt                     ltxselement namebirthdate typexsdate nillabletrue minOccurs0gt                          ltxssequencegt             ltxsextensiongt         ltxscomplexContentgt     ltxscomplexTypegt codepre  pI snipped a lot of what I think is not applicable, of course, so it probably is not valid now, but it illustrates the idea. You see that this XSD imports another XSD for Address, which is below Again, stripped and changed any info thats too much or I cannot show p  precode    ltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsaddresshttpurl.comaddress targetNamespacehttpurl.comaddress elementFormDefaultqualified attributeFormDefaultunqualifiedgt         ltxsimport namespacehttpurl.combag schemaLocationBag API 0.2.xsdgt ltxscomplexType nameInternationalAddressgt         ltxssequencegt             ltxselement nameadresline1 typexsstring nillabletrue minOccurs0gt                 ltxsannotationgt                     ltxsdocumentationgtStuffltxsdocumentationgt                 ltxsannotationgt             ltxselementgt             ltxselement nameadresline2 typexsstring nillabletrue minOccurs0gt                 ltxsannotationgt                     ltxsdocumentationgtMore stuffltxsdocumentationgt                 ltxsannotationgt             ltxselementgt             ltxselement nameregion typexsstring nillabletrue minOccurs0gt             ltxselement namecountry typexsstring nillabletrue minOccurs0gt         ltxssequencegt     ltxscomplexTypegt codepre  pI build an XML validator in my Web Api that does the following, codexsdLocationcode points to the XSD file and codexmlcode is the xml in the response of my web APIp  precodeXmlSchemaSet schemas  new XmlSchemaSet schemas.Addhttpurl.comperson, xsdLocation  XDocument document  XDocument.Loadnew StringReaderxml  bool errors  false document.Validateschemas, o, e gt       Debug.WriteLinee.Message      errors  true  Debug.WriteLineResponse 0, errors  did not validate  is valid codepre  pAnd finally here is the XML that Web API spits out that needs to be validated, again, snipped and modified to only the important parts.p  precodeltperson xmlnsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnshttpurl.compersongt ltaddress xmlnsd2p1httpurl.comaddress ityped2p1InternationalAddressgt         ltd2p1addressline1 iniltrue gt    ltd2p1addressline1 iniltrue gt    ltd2p1region iniltrue gt    ltd2p1country iniltrue gt  ltaddressgt ltnamegtTestltnamegt            ...

However, on the complex properties like codeAddresscode that are validated by another XSD that gets imported it gives the error message mentioned above.p  pI suppose my XML needs another namespace at the top, and needs to namespace that Address node, but I cannot get Web Api to spit out XML that validates, no matter how many [XMLRoot], [XMLElement] or whatever attributes I throw at it. I tried several options found all over StackOverflow of different atrtibutes, IsReferencetrue named parameters on DataContract attributes, almost everything short of writing my own XML serializer.p  pCan anybody help me get in the right direction to validating my XML to this set of XSDs p  pI can do almost anything I want with the Web Api project to mould the XML, but the XSDs are delivered by an external architect and those cannot change.p  pThanksp  hr  pAddendum So I generated an example XML from the XSD using Altova XMLSpy, and I think this illustrated the problem better.

Negative 49 pI am working on a SpringMVC based webapp which uses Cometd for chat purposes. For realtime management of which user is online, we are sending notifications when the user is online.

Lets just keep it for 2 now. So, after 10 minutes we are setting user status to Away from KeyboardAFK.
