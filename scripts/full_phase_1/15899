Positive 15899 pIm pretty new to WPF moving from WinForms. Im trying to transfer some scenario from a WinForms application to a WPF onep  ol liA window has a ListView control with 3 columns.li liThere is a button there to add new rows to that ListView.li liThe first and the second columns contain the ComboBox control.li liThe third column must contain different controls but just one at a time is visible. Which one is visible, it depends on the selected value of the ComboBox at the first column.li liThe content of the ComboBox at the second column changes every time a user selects a value from the ComboBox at the first column.li ol  pThe general scenario is a user selects a type from the list of types from the first ComboBox, after that the second ComboBox changes its content to a list of supported operations for the selected type and the third column at that time must change its content to display a control that supports the input for that type.p  pI know how to implement it using WinForms but I have no idea yet how to do it using WPF.

Websphere portal is made up of LOTS of parts including Websphere Application Server, The portal itself, an express version of db2. The installation never seems to get beyond the W2 disk install, which is where it installs db2 express. The install fails with a pop up that simply says the install failed, check the log file. I did. The log file says that the db2 express install succeeded, but needs a reboot. The installer cannot do this apparently. Now, I am running the install from a user that is an admin on the local machine, but also belongs to the work domain Im in. The installation does warn that there might be issues with doing this during the install, but it never says anything specific and Im yet to find a detailed error on why the install failed.p  pI have verified that the portals user id has a password that abides by our domain rules.p  pIt might also be of note that I have a full version of db2 already installed on my machine but the install doesnt let seem to look for that, nor does it let me disable any of the installation components. I suppose I think this might it because the install process creates a db2user on the windows account. Since Ive already got a full version installed, that user exists already.p  pIf anyone has any thoughts at all as to why this install might be failing, I would love to hear about it.

Negative 15899 pI have an old PowerBuilder application that we are slowly phasing out. We are also moving to a more service orientated. So in order to facilitate this we are using C COM wrappers to call WCF methods so old direct SQL calls can be slowly removed. We also use the C COM wrappers when need functionality is needed in the power builder application. p  pSince we are using COM calls to DLL from PowerBuilder to C, there is no need for an external executable. This means that a app.config file will not be loaded on its own. At least that is what I noticed.  Example Lets say the main DLL that has the wrapper methods is Wrapper.dll. If I had config named Wrapper.dll.config it would not get loaded when the make my call from PowerBuilder to C.p  pThe reason I would like to use a config file is because I would like to start using log4net in the C dlls in order to make debugging easier because it is hard enough with PowerBuilder.  There are other reasons that I would like to load configuration files but the easiest to explain is basically it is easier to set up some stuff using a config file.p  pSo is there a way to load a configuration files into the Configuration manager for a COM call p  pThanks  Tonyp

Negative 15899 pIm trying to create a custom search but getting stuck. What I want is to have a dropdownbox so the user can choose where to search in. These options can mean 1 or more content types.p  pSo if he chooses options A, then the search will look in nodetype P,Q,R. But he may not give those results, but only the uids which will be then themed to gather specific data for that user.p  pTo make it a little bit clearer, Suppose I want to llok for people. The what Im searching in is 2 content profile types. But ofcourse you dont want to display those as a result, but a nice picture of the user and some data.p  pI started with creating a form with a textfield and the dropdown box. Then, in the submit handler, i created the keys and redirected to another pages with those keys as a tail. This page has been defined in the menu hook, just like how search does it.p  pAfter that I want to call codehookviewcode to do the actual search by calling codenodesearchcode, and give back the results.p  pUnfortunately, it goes wrong.

Negative 15899 pI have a managed object that calls a COM server to allocate some memory.

This object implements codeIDisposablecode to help ensure that the correct memoryreleasing COM call is made.p  pIn the event that the codeDisposecode method is emnotem called, I would like the objects finalizer to  free the memory.  The trouble is, the rules of finalization is that you must not access any reference because you dont know what other objects have already been GCd andor finalized before you.  This leaves the only touchable object state to be fields handles being the most common.  p  pBut calling a COM server involves going through an runtime callable wrapper RCW in order to free the memory that I have a cookie to stored in a field.  strongIs that RCW safe to call from a finalizer is it guaranteed to have not been GCd or finalized at this pointstrongp  pFor those of you not familiar with finalization, although the finalizer thread runs in the background of a managed appdomain while its running, at for those cases touching references would theoretically be OK, finalization also happens at appdomain shutdown, and emin any orderem  not just in reference relationship order.  This limits what you can assume is safe to touch from your finalizer.

I added a reference to Oracle.DataAccess which is version 2.111.6.0 Runtime Version is v2.0.50727. I am targeting .NET CLR version 4.0 since all properties of my VS Solution are defaults and this is 2010 RC. I was then able to write a console application in C that established connectivity, executed a SELECT statement, and properly returned data when the table in question does NOT contain a spatial column. My problem is that this no longer works when the table I query has a column of type SDOGEOMETRY in it. p  pBelow is the simple console application I am trying to run that reproduces the problem. When the code gets to the line with the ExecuteReader command, an exception is raised and the message is Unsupported column datatype.p  precodeusing System using System.Data using Oracle.DataAccess.Client  namespace ConsoleTestOracle      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      string oradb  string.FormatData Source0User Id1Password2,                 hostnameservicename, login, password              try                              using OracleConnection conn  new OracleConnectionoradb                                      conn.Open                      OracleCommand cmd  new OracleCommand                     cmd.Connection  conn                     cmd.CommandText  select  from SDO83072DPOINTS                     cmd.CommandType  CommandType.Text                      OracleDataReader dr  cmd.ExecuteReader                                           catch Exception e                              string error  e.Message                             codepre  pThe fact that this code works when used against a table that does not contain a spatial column of type SDOGEOMETRY makes me think I have my windows 7 machine properly configured so I am surprised that I get this exception when the table contains different kinds of columns. I dont know if there is some configuration on my machine or the Oracle machine that needs to be done, or if the Oracle client software I have installed is wrong, or old and needs to be updated.p  pHere is the SQL I used to create the table, populate it with some rows containing points in the spatial column, etc. if you want to try to reproduce this exactly.p  pSQL Create Commandsp  precodecreate table SDO83072DPoints ObjectID number38 not null unique, TestID number, shape SDOGEOMETRY Insert into SDO83072DPoints values 1, 1, SDOGEOMETRY2001, 8307, null, SDOELEMINFOARRAY1, 1, 1,  SDOORDINATEARRAY10.0, 10.0 Insert into SDO83072DPoints values 2, 2, SDOGEOMETRY2001, 8307, null, SDOELEMINFOARRAY1, 1, 1,  SDOORDINATEARRAY10.0, 20.0 insert into usersdogeommetadata values SDO83072DPoints, SHAPE, SDODIMARRAYSDODIMELEMENTLat, 180, 180, 0.05, SDODIMELEMENTLong, 90, 90, 0.05, 8307 create index SDO83072DPointindx on SDO83072DPointsshape indextype is mdsys.spatialindex PARAMETERS sdoindxdims2  codepre  pAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 15899 pAt our company we are developing an application that will consists of several modules. The architecture is pretty much defined but I have seconds thoughts about the presentationlayer and I would really like to hear your opinions. The architecture is as followsp  pForeach module we create several namespaces and those will be compiled in their own class library. So for our CRM module we create the followingp  ul liProductName.CRM.ServiceLayer holds the servicecontracts interfaces of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.ServiceLayer.Implementation implements the servicelayer interfaces of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.BusinessLayer holds the businesscomponents of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.BusinessLayer.BusinessObjects holds the businessObjects of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.DataLayer holds the DAO interfaces of CRM moduleli liProductName.CRM.DataLayer.SqlServer implements the datalayer interfaces of CRM moduleli ul  pWe create the same structure of class libraries for the modules Finance, HRM, Supply, etcp  ul liProductName.Finance....li liProductName.HRM....li lietc. I think you will get the idea for now li ul  pAlso we thought about the Crosscutting Concerns and for that we create the following namespaces and class librariesp  ul liProductName.Framework.ExceptionHandlingli liProductName.Framework.Loggingli liProductName.Framework.Securityli lietcetra...li ul  pSo that is how our architecture is so far and at this moment Im trying to find a proper way for setting up the PresentationLayer. For example, should I make a PresentationLayerlibrary foreach module ProductName.CRM.PresentationLayer, ProductName.Finance.PresentationLayer, etc.. And make an overall ProductName.PresentationLayerlibrary who has references to all the other Module.PresentationLayerlibraries. This overall ProductName.PresentationLayer will then have the LoginMainForm functionality and the ability to start forms that are implemented in one of the modules PresentationLayer. It will be like an entry point of the application to other modules.p  pOr...p  pShould I make just one ProductName.Presentationlibrary that contains all forms for all modules. By doing that that I can easly navigate to other forms and dont have to worry about references between modules when they are going to use each others forms sometimes they will do. p  pThe first solutions sounds good to me. However, when forms from different modules wants to navigate to each other.This kind of functionality will be tough to implement because only one of the two can have the reference to the other.p  pI would really like to hear your opinions about this issue Im dealing with and maybe someone could give me a proper solution or idea that I can use.p  pthanks in advance, Cheersp

Negative 15899 pIm using NSNumber to store various values, but sometimes run into issues when doing calculations with the values and initializing new NSNumber objects for the results. Ive figured out how to overcome it, but I couldnt for the life of me explain why it works and since my grasp on numerical values in computer environments doubles, floats, etc is weak Id like to ask this question to learn. p  pFirst example is when I am converting between different units of measurement, in this particular case its between mmolL and mgdl. Getting an NSNumber which represents a mmolL value, I extract its double value and perform the calculation. Then I create a new NSNumber with initWithDouble and return the result.p  pHowever, I get odd quirks. If the mmolL value is 10.0, the corresponding mgdl value is 180.0 the rate, obviously, is simply 18. But when I later need to let the user select a new value in a picker view and use the NSNumber intValue to get the integer digits of the current value using my own extension for getting the fractional digits, the int is 179 Ive checked all the intermediate double values during calculation as well as the new NSNumbers double value and all is fine 180.00000 is the result. Interestingly, this doesnt happen for all values, just some 10.0 being one real example.p  pThe second example is when I retrieve double values from an Sqlite3 database and store them in NSNumbers. Again, most values work fine, but occasionally I get weird stuff back. For instance, if I save 6.7 in the database checking when it is saved that that is in fact the value, what my NSNumber will show after retrieval is 6.699999. I cant actually remember at the moment of writing if thats whats in the database as well, but I think it is  I can check later.p  pBoth of these instances can be circumvented by using an intermediate float value and NSNumber initWithFloat instead of initWithDouble. So in my conversion, for example, I just do a float resultAsFloat  resultAsDouble and use initWithFloat for the new NSNumber.p  pApologies for the longwinded question and if its just my own knowledge about working with numerical values that is lacking, but I would really appreciate if someone could explain this to mep  pThanks,p  pAndersp  pstrong EDIT 1 strongp  pCode for the unit conversion examplep  precodeNSNumber convertNumberNSNumber aNumber withUnitFCUnit aUnit    if origin unit and target unit are the same, return original number if [aUnit.uid isEqualToStringself.target.uid]     return aNumber   determine if origin unit and target unit are comparable if aUnit.quantity  self.target.quantity     return nil   if so, convert the number...   get bases double originBase double targetBase if aUnit.metre  nil       originBase  [aUnit.metre doubleValue]     targetBase  [self.target.metre doubleValue]   else if aUnit.kilogram  nil       originBase  [aUnit.kilogram doubleValue]     targetBase  [self.target.kilogram doubleValue]   else if aUnit.second  nil       originBase  [aUnit.second doubleValue]     targetBase  [self.target.second doubleValue]   else if aUnit.quantity  FCUnitQuantityGlucose        special case for glucose      if [aUnit.uid isEqualToStringFCKeyUIDGlucoseMillimolesPerLitre]   mmolL gt mgdl          originBase  1         targetBase  0.0555555555555556  since 1  0.0555555555555556  18       else if [aUnit.uid isEqualToStringFCKeyUIDGlucoseMilligramsPerDecilitre]   mgdl gt mmolL          originBase  0.0555555555555556         targetBase  1         find conversion rate double rate  originBase  targetBase   convert the value double convert  [aNumber doubleValue]  rate   TMP FIX this fixes an issue where the intValue of convertedNumber would be one less  than it should be if the number was created with a double instead of a float.

Negative 15899 pI am curious as to how caching works in Google App Engine or any cloud based application.

Negative 15899 pI have made an app which uses a bluetooth barcode scanner. When the barcode scanner is attached, the on screen keyboard will not come up anymore. Therefore I cannot use the on screen keyboard for text input. It is not very handy to do text input through barcodes as I want to input very variable data so I am looking for a way to present the on screen keyboard although an external keyboard is attached. The Apple wireless keyboard achieves that by sending the eject key to the iPad.p  pI have found on the internet that the eject key is keycode 161. I can make an NSString with the eject key as followsp  precode Put the eject key Unicode U23CF in a NSString. Two different ways possible NSString eject  [NSString stringWithFormatC, 0x23CF] NSString eject2  [NSString stringWithUTF8Stringu23CF] codepre  pWhen looking at the debugger, both NSStrings show an eject icon as the contents of the NSString so it seems I am having the code right to fill the NSString with the eject button. But my problem is, how do I send this NSString to the keyboard input system in order to trigger the on screen keyboard to pop up I cannot sent it by making a barcode with the contents u23CF is it is not recognized as a UTF8 string. Setting the text of a UITextField either with or without  the return key doesnt do the job either.p  pCan anybody help me with this problem Am I missing something To my knowledge the only control Apple gives us over the on screen keyboard is with becomeFirstResponder and resignFirstResponder but thats useless when an external keyboard or scanner is attached.p

Negative 15899 pGood afternoon in my timezone.p  pI have a few little doubts regarding the use of this tag library and the actionForm.

I put the information in the request scope request.setAttributereadOnly,data.

Negative 15899 pI have been working with Spring for a while now to realize that not all of the incoming requests I receive in my app are HTTPbased. Some requests are emailbased, and need emailbased responses, others are socketbased receiving notifications when a value changes in my NOSQL store. All of them, though use more or less the same MVC infrastructure. p  pTherefore, I thought that maybe rearchitecting the application, in order to remove the coupling between controllers and the HTTP infrastructure will help.p  pThe dispatcher should no longer call controller methods directly, but rather extract the request parameters, and use them to create an abstract message or event, which it then puts on a message bus. On the other hand, every controller will subscribe its actions instances of the Action class  an implementation of the Command pattern for different events. p  pSince I am quite new to Spring Integration, JMS, and other things like that, I have no idea, which messaging technology to choose. Also, I am pretty sure that an architecture like this has been developed already. Perhaps, I may not even be on the right track.p  pI accept all kinds of suggestions on how to proceed.p

I think that I can see in theory why this happens for this case, because I asked for the data twice  although it could have been done in memory and not by the SQL with an extra join  but in my case I did not ask for data twice, I asked for different columns only once. I did this test to see if the double join is consistent.p  pI also tried runningp  precodeLocationBPNTips     .Wheret gt t.LocationId  33     .Selecttip gt new                   CreatedAt  tip.CreatedAt,             Text  tip.TipText,             LocationId  tip.LocationId,             OwnerName  tip.User.Name     .ToList codepre  pThis one returned clean, single inner join as expected, but it is not what I am trying to dop  pstrongSo the question isstrong Is this a bug am I using the EF incorrectlyp

Negative 15899 pMy company has begun deploying Glassfish as our app server of choice. For anyone whos curious, we love it We have multiple products, so weve taken to setting up one cluster per product. Each node is a rather beefy box, so each node is shared across multiple clusters. p  pAs Ive been working to grow our deployments, Ive begun wondering if there is a limit to the number of nodes that Glassfish will handle. My understanding is that a given cluster can only replicate up to 5 nodes, but I have not found a limit on the number of nodes managed by a single DAS Domain Admin Server.p  pDoes anyone know if such a limit exists While it would be rather neat if we could manage dozens of clusters across dozens of boxes through a single user interface, Id rather start planning for additional DAS instances now if they should become necessary.p  pIve checked the Glassfish docs and asked Google halfdozen different ways, so I emthinkem theres no limit. But Id like to get some sort of confirmation on that.p  pThanks in advance, everyonep  pP.S. Everyone should try Glassfish. If youre still using Tomcat, you dont know what youre missingp

Negative 15899 pI have a page whose layout is fairly simple A button on top showlikes toggles all liked posts. All posts in a foreach loop contains a button with class of .like the like button. When .like is pressed it is liked. For now lets assume this is permanent.p  pI have a variable likestatus which tracks the number of times showlikes is pressed. When likestatus divided by 2 has no remainder, that means all liked posts should be hidden. If there is a remainder, all liked posts should be visible. Pretty straight forward rightp  pOn page load, likestatus is set to 1 and since 1 divded by 2 has a remainder, all liked posts are hidden on pageload. This works in both firefox AND chrome.p  pBecause likestatus is set to 1, all posts the user decides to like SHOULD toggle automatically. This works in firefox BUT NOT chrome.p  pThe question is, whyp  pjavascriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction      likestatus  1 on pageload, likestatus is 1 so all liked posts are hidden.  document.onclick, .like, function                when like button is pressed do this     postID  this.attrid.replacelike,         get the ID of the post       Declare variables     value  1                                            this represents that the post is liked to be stored in a database      myajax                                               send to database      return false   function myajax                                           Send values to database     .ajax         url check.php,                                   check.php receives the values sent to it and stores them in the database         type POST,         data postID  postID  ampvalue  value,       send the post ID and like value         success functionresult              if result.indexOfNo lt 0                  If return doesnt contain string No, do this                 if value  1                            If post is liked, do this                     post  postID.removeClassdislike.addClasslike               sets div class of the post to liked                     likebtn  postID.removeClasslikeimgoff.addClasslikeimgon        changes the image of the like button so it is visibly activated   UP TO HERE, THE CODE WOKS IN BOTH CHROME AND FIREFOX.

Negative 15899 pI have a Document Sequence table with 1 row and 1 column. All it does is have a sequence number. Every time we need to create a new document, we call a stored proc which updates the existing sequence number in this table by 1 and read that and use that for id in the document table. p  pMy question is If multiple requests try to call this stored proc which updates the sequence number and returns it, is there a chance it will give the same number to multiple callers I right now have another stored proc which calls this seq number generator sp in a transaction and then create a document with the obtained id. I was wondering if I had to do it with just entity framework in code and not use the stored proc, is it possible Will Entity framework 4 support transaction by itself so that only one process is calling the seq updater sp at a time p

Instead, it clips the codedtcode elements off.p  pHow can I get the codedlcode element to recognise and expand its size according to the size of the contents of the codedtcode elements accordingly, while keeping their position coderelativecode and codeabsolutecode relationship because I need to position the elements differentlyp

Negative 15899 pSince a week back Im seeing a very annoying behavior from VS2010 As Im debugging a project and the debugger stops on a breakpoint Windows freezes for almost ten seconds. I say Windows freezes because the mouse and keyboard are useless during this time period.p  pThe problem only happens as I debug a specific project and Ive tried it on two diffrent machines with the same result. The project is WPF and I do hook the keyboard at one point not the mouse though but that code hasnt been touched for months while the problem is just a week old.p  pI did install Teleriks big suite of everything trial just before this started to show so my first suspicion was Teleriks VS integration was the culprit. I uninstalled all Telerik VS integrations the JustXXX products but the problem remain.p  pI would be very greatful to anyone being abe to give a hint as to what might be going on here.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDIT 1strong I have now tried building a new solution, moving all projects into it but the problem remains.p  pI then uninstalled everything Telerik, just to make sure, but this also was to no effect.p  pThe next test was to load the exact same solution on a different machine and that did help. That machine has no 3rd party integrations with VS2010 except for reSHarper 6.1.p  pI have also analyzed the issue  bit more and the typical scenario is that the first few times a breakpoint is hit the UI freezes for apeoximately ten seconds. Mousekeyboard stops responding but the cursor keeps blinking in the code editor. The next few breakpoints does the same and often stepping from one line to another will cause a very long delay no UI freeze though.p  pAlso, if the first breakpoint is set very early in my application startup code I might not experience the problem. But as I continue to step through the code the debugger becomes more sluggish as the application initializes itself in separate threads.p  pAs Ive said before this happens for a single application so the code is clearly related somehow. p  pDoes anyone have good knowledge of how the debugger operates Apart from the obvious steps needed whenever a breakpoint is set or the user steps from one line to another refresh stack trace and watch windows what is going on in the background that might freeze up everything and how is it possiblep  pMy last hope is a complete reinstall of VS2010 but I hope I can solve this before that option is required.p

That way, when they save my website, theyll save it with the hash and thus I can check whether they opened up my website through the normal link my.website.com or through their bookmark my.website.comspecialhash.

Negative 15899 pI have a movieClip in my library called blueBox, with a corresponding class, blueBox.as, which holds the blueBox constructor, some variables and a function to handle a MOUSEDOWN event. I also have a movieClip called redBox that needs a almost identical class to blueBox.as. Is it possible to duplicate blueBox.as, changing only the name of the constructor and the value of a variable without doing so manually and saving it as redBox.as It isnt a big problem doing it manually for now, but as this project grows, it will create a meaningless amount of files, all containing the same information and this seems a bit redundant, any insight welcome.p

Negative 15899 pI have a software as a service app that uses JSON communicated via a RESTful API.  p  pSimply stated what are the best practices for capturing and reporting exceptions when using a RESTful API with JSON data interchangep  pMy first thought was to see what Rails does by generating a scaffold, but thats clearly not right.  Heres an excerptp  precodeclass MumblesController lt ApplicationController     GET mumbles1    GET mumbles1.json   def show     mumble  Mumble.findparams[id]     respondto do format       format.html  show.html.erb       format.json  render json mumble      end   end  end codepre  pIn this case, if the JSON code sends a nonexistent ID, e.g.p  precodehttpwww.myhost.commumbles99999.json codepre  pthen Mumble.find will raise ActiveRecordRecordNotFound.  ActionController will catch that and render an error page in HTML.  But HTML is useless to the client that is expecting JSON.p  pI could work around that by wrapping the Mumble.find in a codebegin ... rescue RuntimeErrorcode block and rendering a JSON status  unprocessableentity or something.p  pBut then what if the clients app sends an invalid path, e.g.p  precodehttpwww.myhost.combadtypo1.json codepre  pIs a JSON based app supposed to catch that and return an error in JSON  If so, where do I capture that without digging deep into ActionDispatchp  pSo overall, do I punt and let ActionController generate HTML if theres an error  That doesnt feel right...p

Negative 15899 pIm currently developing a simple P2P network as an exercise. Each node in the network sends heartbeats to a subset of the other nodes to be able to detect nodes that have left the network. Beside the heartbeat packets I send packets when new nodes joinleave the network, when they want to locate a resource small text files, etc. All packets are UDP packets.p  pWhenever I receive a packet I start a new thread that handles that specific packet. I am however concerned with the amount of threads I start during one applications lifetime which adds up to quite a lot Especially because of the heartbeats.  There is also the risk of deadlocks and the like I would like to avoid. p  pI thought about having a queue or something where I put all incoming packets and have a single thread handling all packets one at a time from that queue something like the producerconsumer pattern. I would like the packets to be handled rapidly so the sender doesnt think the packet is lost.p  pWhat is the best way to handle a lot of different incoming packets without having to start a new thread for each of them Should I go with what I have, the producerconsuming or something differentp

Negative 15899 pI want to know what do you think about this. Is recommended to use synchronous requests XMLHttpRequest in a web worker What problems can I findp  pI have been testing this in my app and I havent find any trouble. But Im afraid of this synchronus behaviour because of old experiences with jQuery and AJAX. My app gets a big amount of data from several tables in a database, and this requires a time. For each bunch of data retrieved from a table, I need to instantly process it to not delay the whole thing too much. Meanwhile, the user is interacting with the browser, so it can be blocked, and I thought that web workers would work fine. Do you thing that this is a good solution Or should I try with asynchronus requestsp  pThank you.p

Negative 15899 pI have been playing with the iPhone gyroscope and accelerometer and trying to crate an accurate measurement of the device rotation by using both sensors.p  pFirst I calculate the devices anglular velocity using the gyroscope, then I find the angle using the accelerometer by finding where the gravity is pointing, then using atan2. Then I use them to create a nice estimate of the angle using this formulap  precodeaccAngle  atan2fyAcceleration, xAcceleration  reading from accelerometer gyroAngle  gyroVelocity  timeSinceUpdate  reading from gyroscope estimatedAngle  0.97  estimatedAngle  gyroAngle  0.03  accAngle  filtered angle codepre  pI then use estimatedAngle to rotate a CALayer.p  pIt works like a charm until the device is turned sideways, and the atan2 function jumps from pi to pi and back.

Negative 15899 pIm trying to create an MySQL UDF getFile which is supposed to return the contents of a text file from a certain directory on disk. The problem is that the call works once or twice, but upon calling the UDF for a second or third time the MySQL server crashes.p  pI cant reproduce the error by calling getFile directly from the mysql console, here it seems to work fine  it seems to occur only when I call the UDF from the stored procedure. The error also disappears when I call only the small 2.5 k session file while omitting the bigger mailConfirmation 45 k and mailProtocol 88 k files, so it seems to have something to do with the file size.p  pMySQL version 5.1.493p  pOS Debian 6 Squeezep  pAny suggestions or ideas will be greatly appreciated  thanks in advancep  pThis is the UDFp  precode   Skeleton libary for MySQL.

Tomorrow isntli liAnother day 12 August, another timeli li1208 is another formatli lihave another  081212 could beli lifinally august 12 would beli ul  pWhat I would expect to get from each of these results is 20120801 000000, 20130812 000000, 20130812 000000, 20120812 000000, 20130812 000000.p  pI currently have this codep  precodefrom dateutil import parser print parser.parseToday is August 2012. Tomorrow isnt,fuzzyTrue codepre  pYou will see from this that the date prints as 20120827 000000 because today is the 27th of the month.  What I would want in this example is 20120801 000000.  p  pHow do I force it to always put the first of the month if a day is not given  For example if I give August 2012 it should return 20120801, if I give it 12 August 2012 it should return 20120812.p

I have verified the path to dcpromo, and have even tried running other executables in the System32 folder like ipconfig and whoami.p  pThe service is running as Local System account and the only way I have found to get it to work is save the command to a batch file and impersonate an Administrator to execute the batch file.

Negative 15899 pIm building my first REST API at least trying for a personal project.p  pIn this project there are resources called codeplayercodes which hold can be in a codeteamcode.

I dont see any changes in codeTextBoxMarksInPercentcode. br  strongWhat i am getting wrong br  Why my value isnt updated after comming back from another textboxstrongp
Negative 15899 pI find myself having to create a lot of immutable classes and Id like to find a way to do it with no redundant information. I cant use an anonymous type because I need to return these classes from methods. I want intellisense support, so Id prefer not to use Dictionaries, dynamic or anything like that. I also want wellnamed properties, which rules out Tuplelt. So far, some patterns Ive triedp  precode inherit Tupleltgt. This has the added benefit of giving you Equals and GetHashCode public class MyImmutable  Tupleltint, string, boolgt     public MyImmutableint field1, string field2, bool field3  basefield1, field2, field3       public int Field1  get  return this.Item1      public string Field2  get  return this.Item2      public bool Field3  get  return this.Item3        using a custom SetOnceltTgt struct that throws an error if set twice or if read before being set  the nice thing about this approach is that you can skip writing a constructor and   use object initializer syntax. public class MyImmutable      private SetOnceltintgt field1     private SetOnceltstringgt field2     private SetOnceltboolgt field3      public int Field1  get  return this.field1.Value  set  this.field1.Value  value     public string Field2  get  return this.field2.Value  set  this.field2.Value  value     public bool Field3  get  return this.field3.Value  set  this.field3.Value  value       EDIT another idea I thought of create an ImmutableltTgt type which allows you to  easily expose types with simple getset properties as immutable public class ImmutableltTgt      private readonly DictionaryltPropertyInfo, objectgt values             public ImmutableT obj           if we are worried about the performance of this reflection, we could always statically cache          the getters as compiled delegates         this.values  typeofT.GetProperties             .Wherepi gt pi.CanRead              Utils.MemberComparer is a static IEqualityComparer that correctly compares              members so that ReflectedType is ignored             .ToDictionarypi gt pi, pi gt pi.GetValueobj, null, Utils.MemberComparer           public TProperty GetltTPropertygtExpressionltFuncltT, TPropertygtgt propertyAccessor          var prop  PropertyInfoMemberExpressionpropertyAccessor.Body.Member         return TPropertythis.values[prop]         usage public class Mutable  int A  get set     we could easily write a ToImmutable extension that would give us type inference var immutable  new ImmutableltMutablegtnew Mutable  A  5  var a  immutable.Getm gt m.A   obviously, this is less performant than the other suggestions and somewhat clumsier to use.  However, it does make declaring the immutable type quite concise, and has the advantage that we can make  any mutable type immutable     EDIT Phil Patterson and others mentioned the following pattern  this seems to be roughly the same  characters as with Tupleltgt, but results in many  more lines and doesnt give you free Equals and GetHashCode public class MyImmutable      public MyImmutableint field1, string field2, bool field3             Field1  field1         Field2  field2         Field3  field3         public int Field1  get private set     public string Field2  get private set     public bool Field3  get private set   codepre  pThese are both somewhat less verbose than the standard pattern of creating readonly fields, setting them via a constructor, and exposing them via properties. However, both of these methods still have lots of redundant boilerplate.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 15899 pI do a lot of front end work and was thinking of picking up CSS LESS, but midway through learning it, realized it may not work the way that I thought it would work and might not be able to help me as much. So I think below is how CSS LESS works, could someone who have used it just confirm pleasep  blockquote   pCSS LESS works using the SimpLESS compiler and makes the process of   initial css coding more easy with programming elements implemented.   However, before uploading the css code, it must be converted from the   dynamic .less format to the normal .css format and once uploaded to   the server, can only act as a static .css file.p blockquote  pIs the above correct I ask because I work with a lot of wordpress websites and themes that already have the majority of their stylesheet created, and if I have to compile the .less format to .css format and reupload every single time rather than being able to use it as a dynamic preloaded library like jQuery, then I might not be able to get as much out of CSS LESS as I previously thought it would benefit me.p

This key is added to my JList. Then, when I call the second button Considering what is selected in the JList, I add an element to the ArrayListp  pCode for the second buttonp  precodebtnInsertContent.addActionListenernew ActionListener           Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              mainMethods.attachValueToKeymainList.getSelectedValue, textContent.getText             mainCombo.addItemtextContent.getText             System.out.printlnmainMethods.matrix                codepre  pThe second argument of the attachValueToKey receives the String given by the textField, and I reach the big problemp  pI cant add it to the ArrayList inside the sendKeyToMatrix method, which is obvious, but thats a big problem, because if I declare the variable as a field up there So that I can access it down in the other scope, I get wrong and esoterically misterious results that are unknown to me.p  pResuming this in a simple question How to access the variable inside the other methodp  pIf I declare the variable inside the attachValueToKey, it will create an ArrayList inside of the ArrayList every time the button is pressed. p  pWell, I thank you all for the help. Probably there must be a way to summon the solution through Object Oriented Magic, with instances and the like.p

Negative 15899 pThe Controller in question is my Account controller which has actions to sign in, register, log off, recover password etc.p  pMy application is web based but soon will also available on Android and iOS. p  pMy idea was to reuse Account controller for authenticationauthorization stuff from mobile apps too. With this in mind, I started off with creating Web API Account controller and then ended up creating multiple actions that use same verb. Runtime didnt like it and though I may be able to fix this ambiguity problem by creating multiple routes or may be by some other means, I feel that would be sort of a hack to Web APIs REST based design. p  pOr I can just use good old MVC controller, but then I would need to take care of mobile clients separately.p  pCan someone help me to design this betterp

Negative 15899 pIve pored over the Django docs regarding the contenttypes framework several times, and I simply dont understand it well enough to implement generic relations in my project. Ive looked for online examples or tutorials regarding the matter, but I cant find a single one. Call me dumb, but I need some help on this one please dont answer by simply linking to the docs. Based on the lack of resources online, I believe if you answer this question with a thorough example, your answer may be the most helpful example online to date regarding django generic relations bonus.p  pSo, my question is can someone show a simple example of the models and maybe a couple lines of code showing how to interact with instances of a generic modelp  hr  pAs inspiration, here is what I believe would be a very common situationp  pemA site has media items that are largely treated the same, but are slightly different. For example, lets say there are image and video items, and users can like an item or comment on an item. The likes and comments should be treated the same, regardless of whether they are posted on an image or video item. So, if there is an ItemView for viewing an image or a video in a users album, the following kinds of calls would be possible  codemediaitem.comments.allcode or codelenmediaitem.likes.allcode or codecomment.userwhocommentedcode, without having to know which kind of media item it is image or video.emp  pI believe you would need strongsix modelsstrong for thisp  ul liAbstract codeMediaItemcode classli liTwo different types of media item codeImageItemcode and codeVideoItemcodeli liAbstract codeMediaItemActionscode classli liTwo different types of actions that can be done towards media items codeLikecode and codeCommentcodeli ul  hr  pIf you know how to use this Django feature, please show us a full example I feel like it would be an extremely powerful tool and am aching to use it in my application.

Negative 15899 pemFirst some context we are developing a large desktop WPF application in .NET 4.5 targeting 64 bit Windows 7 and 8. We are using Visual Studio 2012.2 soon to be .3 then probably 2013 and TFS 2012 again .2 soon to be .3 then 2013.emp  pemCurrently this product is all in a single large solution just over 50 projects yielding a WPF exe, a load of dlls and a nice MSI to install it.emp  pemWe use TFS gated and scheduled to build the solution, its installer WiX and run its tests SpecFlow for BDD and MSTest unit tests and this is working very well.emp  pemI have a separate scheduled TFS build that deploys the MSI to physical test rig in a untrusted AD domain via a PowerShell script see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16542441tfs2012labdefault11templatedeployscriptsfailwithteamfoundationserverTFS2012 LabDefault.11 template deploy scripts fail with Team Foundation Server could not complete the deployment taska for details of the challenges involved with thatemp  pOK so thats where I am, now I want to take things to the next step CodedUI tests to drive full app integration test I want to Smoke Test my builds.p  pSo being a simple soul I added a new project to my products solution a CodedUI test project.p  pThis happily runs the locally installed product rather then the just built one as I ultimately want the CUIT to be running on a deployed test rig as a smoke test, and that rig has just installed the MSI I just built and performs some UI tests with assertions.p  pNow strongmy problem is with the CUIT project as part of the products solution a local test run finds and runs my CUIT tests, and this is undesiredstrong. I only want to run the CUIT tests in a lab builds test phase.p  pSo strongis putting the CUIT project into the product solution a bad ideastrong or strongshould it be a separate solutionstrong Splitting them seems wrong somehow as they are related the CUIT project is the full stack integration test for the solutions deployable application.p  pCan I include the CUIT in the products solution and stop the test runner seeing the tests or is it better just to have two solutions p  pWhat are the pros and cons folksp  h1Updateh1  pIn the end we created a new solution containing a coded UI test project and ensured this was built with the same TFS build that built the UI solution. This allows us to load and run the coded UI tests locally without issues, the unit tests in the main UI project are left unmolested. Still seems a little disjointed but on a multiple person team per user test settings were too awkward splitting the coded UI into a different solution was simpler.p

Negative 15899 pI have a strange problem that I am at a complete loss to explain.  In order to describe the problem I need to describe the flow of this particular part of my webapp.p  pImage one device, in this case a desktop PC running a modern browser.  When this user is connected it acts as the master.  This master retrieves the current time in javascript like sop  precodegettime  function                var d  new Date               return d.getTime  this.cache.starttime               We have tried using the modern Date.now method also but to no avail               return Date.now  this.cache.starttime , codepre  pThis time is sent via a websocket into node js and is temporarily stored server side for this particular stream.p  pNow image several other devices, a mixture of mobile phones, tablets and other desktop computers.  These devices in essence become slaves to the master and we require they need to sync up timewise.  In order to achieve this when these slaves connect the ndoe.js server pushes the saves codestarttimecode from the master of this stream into the slaves.p  pThis variable becomes the property codethis.cache.starttimecode as can be seen in the function above.p  pFrom this start time syncopation takes place by subtracting the current time in the slaves browser from the start time.p  pThe reasons for needing to do this are irrelevant to this question and as such I will omit them.  However I will add a little detail by explaining that there is ongoing processing going on on each of the slaves that simply needs to start at exactly the same array index as that which the master is currently processing.  By syncing the codestarttimecode variable across the master and all of its slaves, we can obtain the correct array index and begin time based processing from there.p  pThe problem I have is that in every browser I try with the exception of mobile safari I have tested ios 6 and ios 7 beta2, all of the slaves sync up perfectly with the master.p  pAs you can see in the code above I have tried using the codeDate.Nowcode method instead but to no avail.  From monitoring node.js I can see that the server is pushing the correct codestarttimecode into my iphone, yet the result when modifying the variable in mobile safari seems to come out several seconds different every time.p  pTo make matters more difficult I do not currently have access to an Apple computer and as such am unable to properly debug mobile safari to understand what is going on.p  pI am at a complete loss and cannot understand why or how Apples javascript Date implementation could be throwing back different results to other browsers.  It just doesnt make sense.p  pIs there something I am unaware of with regards to working with mobile safari Are there any known differences with Apples method of getting the current time in javascript  Are there any other suggestions for how I could accurately gather the current time that is consistent across browsersp  pThanks in advance for any suggestions or advice.p  pstrongEDITstrong  Ive just had a rather sobering thought.  When you get the time in javascript does it use the clients system clock  Meaning that if they are out by even a few seconds this will be innacurate  i.e. Master time might be 163122 whereas iphone time might be 163116.p  pIf that is the case then I need a complete rethink about how best to sync up these devices.  If that is indeed the reason for the difference I will of course accept that as the answer.p

Negative 15899 pI am having a big problem in Matlab, because it seems that I want to do something that is not so usual.p  pBasically I am trying to implement a way of group distribution together called Vincentizing.In order to do that I am following the instruction of a paper emRatcliff 1979  Group Reaction Time Distributions and an Analysis of Distribution Statisticsem.  Everything is fine until I have to plot the actual graph. I have an array that contains the quantiles of my dataset. The tutorial I am following says p  pdistribution histograms can be constructed by plotting quantiles on the abscissa and then constructing rectangles between adjacent quantiles such that all the rectangles have equal areas, as in Figure 2 link of the image belowp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimagebtftrd6y7 relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagebtftrd6y7ap  pOnce I calculate the quantiles, I can set the area to some value, lets say 10, and I can therefore calculate the height of each bar. The width of each bar is the distance between two adjacent quantiles, and of course I can calculate that as well. I have all the information I need, but I dont know how to plot a graph. How can, in matlab, plot I graph like the one in figure it seems that I can plot histogram of different width, but with the hist function I cannot actually specify the height. With the bar function, however, I emcanem specify the height but it seems I cannot change the width..p  pEvery help is appreciated. p

Negative 15899 pi have a strange problem with QStateMachine, which i cannot solve for a week.p  pstrongBrief explanationstrongp  pI use QStateMachine in my application for controlling of sending commands to a biomedical device, connected through COM port. The whole state machine is complicated with hundreds of states and frequent substating. p  pMachine is being generated from devices communication protocol, based on users preference. For example, if user wants some reaction from device, this reaction is composed of several subreactions that consist of elementary steps instructions for the device. Application builds whole reaction from these elementary steps and starts it on state machine.p  pTherefore, Ive created class emCompositeReactionControlem inherited from QState which allows to build a composite from particular substates.p  pQSignalTransition instances are used to connect states together.p  pstrongProblem descriptionstrongp  pSometimes the machine does not transit from one state to another, when finish signal of previous state is emitted.p  pstrongNOTESstrongp  ol liI am 100 sure that state is connected.li liI am 100 sure that signal is fired.li liEvent through machine and its states run in separate thread from the rest of application, this particular signal is fired and caught in SAME threadli liIt happens randomly in all reactions there is no particular reaction or substate connected with this problemli liSubstate which caused problem in one run reaction, runs without any problem in other runs of same reactionli liIt happens when StateMachine runs for long time, it never appears before 4th reaction no matter which reactions are chosen by user.li ol  pstrongCODEstrongp  pProblematic parts are marked with comment HERE IS PROBLEM in the following code...p  pstrongAdding of new substate to CompositeReactionControlstrongp  precode   brief Add new reaction control as a child of this composite   param reaction child reaction inherited from QState   return added child reaction   AbstractReactionControl CompositeReactionControladdChildReaction     AbstractReactionControl reaction      Check whether reaction is valid   if reaction  NULL      QString msg  trCannot add NULL subreaction to reaction 1.

Negative 15899 pI have an availability calendar in which I am currently adding in dates one by one, and using a mysql query to determine if there exists a row with a certain date and changing the class of the day to booked Red. p  pI would like to enter in a range into my form, and process it through php or mysql into multiple, individual dates. My date format is MDYYYY, or MMDDYYYY, both are accepted. Unfortunately, when I built my calendar, I did not use the date format in sql for entries, but used varchar.p  pIs there a way to enter into my form for example 112014132014 and have php convert that to 112014, 122014, 132014, and then have a mysql INSERT query to insert multiple values at oncep  precodeif emptyPOST  false ampamp emptyerrors  true  adcpdata  array date      gt POST[date], customer  gt POST[customer], notes     gt POST[notes],              insertadcpadcpdata headerLocation adcp.phpsuccess exit codepre  pthe insertadcp function looks like thisp  precodefunction insertadcp adcpdata      arraywalkadcpdata, arraysanitize     fields   . implode, , arraykeysadcpdata .      data   . implode, , adcpdata .       mysqlqueryINSERT INTO adcp fields VALUES data codepre  pp  pMy workaround and last resort will be to add multiple text inputs and just add multiple dates manually so I only have to submit once. But a range is so much fasterp  pAs a last note, if I could have those multiple entries keep the customer and notes values for each date in the range that would be amazing. I am prepared to lose those fields though to make this work. Thanksp

Negative 15899 pIve played around with this a bit now, but cant get my head around itp  pUsing angular 1.2.2, angularFire 0.5.0 and latest nggridp  pSo I have a firebase and Im using angularFire to extract my data into an nggrid component like thisp  precodeFirst I go get my data, in this case something called grades from ....dbgrades     var promise  angularFirenew Firebasescope.fireBaseUrl, scope, grades When theyre fetched I start up a watcher     promise.thenfunctiongrades      startWatchGradescope, filterFilter, appSettings   Then I bind that grades as a datasource to my nggrid scope.gridOptions    data grades, enableCellSelection false, enableRowSelection true, etc...., codepre  pWorks great and Ive done controls that add new items to grades push and remove items splice and everything gets reflected to the nggrid quite nicely. Like sop  precodeAdding new like this is ok scope.grades.pushsomenewdatahere  Deleting old like this is ok scope.grades.splicerow.rowIndex, 1 codepre  pBut this approach does autogenerated intbased keys to the firebase that change all the time when modified so I wanted to get control of the keys so I changed adding the items to use insteadp  precodevar fbRef  new Firebasescope.fireBaseUrl var newRef  fbRef.pushsomeitemshere codepre  pAnd everything works ok storing the data into firebase with my noninteger ids, but it doesnt bind to the nggrid anymore. Dumping the grades into the console shows all the rows being returned, but it doesnt show up in the nggrid.p  pSo in a nutshell Integer based index generated by angularFire works ok in nggrid, custom alphanumeric created by firebase.push doesnt.p  pI hope it doesnt sound too cryptic. Thought of doing a fiddle, but lets hope its some gotcha Ive overlooked and simple to solve. If not Ill try to patch one up.p  pThanksp

Negative 15899 pThe main running example of the bAngular Dart tutorialb is a bRecipe Book appb. The exercise at the end of the a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularangular.dart.tutorialwikiIntroducingfiltersandservicesexploremore relnofollowbChapter 5b on ifilters and servicesia suggests trying to icreate a [custom] filter that will multiply all the amounts [of each ingredient listed] in the recipesi thus allowing a iuser to double, triple, or quadruple the recipei. E.g. an ingredient of 12 cup of flour would become 1 cup of flour when doubled.p  pI have written such a custom filter it takes a list of codeIngredientcodes consisting of a codequantitycode and a codedescriptioncode and returns a new list of new codeIngredientcodes with increased quantities, but I am getting the following errorp  precode5 digest iterations reached. Aborting codepre  pMy question is bwhat is the required andor permitted behavior of an AngularDart custom filter codecallcode methodb E.g., clearly it is permitted to remove i.e. filter elements from its input list, but can it also add new or replace elements The Dart angular.core a hrefhttpci.angularjs.orgviewDartjobangular.dartmasterjavadocangular.coreNgFilter.html relnofollowNgFiltera documentation simply says that a filter is a class with a call method. I have not found more details.p  pExtrapolating from the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17116114howtotroubleshootangular10digestiterationsreachederrorthis AngularJS posta, it would seem that repeated invocations of codecallcode should eventually yield the same result. If so, this would be a reasonable constraint.p  pYielding the same result could mean that codecallcode needs to be bidempotentb, but in the case of Dart such idempotence should be relative to codecode object equivalence not codeidenticalcode object identity, IMHO.

I am new to Angular and decided to jump in with AngularDart, so any help in explaining the effects of the various flavors of codecallcode, or in finding documentation for the expected behavior of codecallcode, or letting me know if you think such a custom filter simply cannot be written would be appreciated.p

Negative 15899 pSo I have a C struct, which has a static array as a member, and I want to ask for its size in the constructor.  As I understood from this article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary4s7x1k91VS.71.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary4s7x1k91VS.71.aspxa, sizeof can be applied to a static array to find the size in bytes of the entire array, not just its type.

Negative 15899 pI need to save some sessionuser related information in my MVC project. Since it should be unique and available throughout the lifetime of the session, I thought about sessionwide singleton.

Since this sounds like a generally bad idea, I thought about using a hrefhttpcsharpindepth.comarticlesgeneralsingleton.aspxcctor relnofollowthe 4th version of Jon Skeets singletona. In a couple of quick tests I wasnt able to see any violation of the singleton pattern per user session i.e. only one object for every session was created.

Why on earth is this happening Is the splashscreen hiding before everything loads or why I noticed that when I set the splashscreen a value for example 3 seconds, the white flash disappears but I want it to disappear as fast as the device is ready because I have another effect wich starts with the device ready and if I enter the second time in the app, this loads faster and the splashscreen just stays on unnecesarry and the effect happends underneath the splashscreen.p  pSo how to finally solve this thingp  pI also tried p  precodeltpreference nameAutoHideSplashScreen valuefalse gt codepre  pI tried setting the body background to black because the effect I was talking about was a black div that fades out at the start of the application.p  pAnd I also tried making webview blackp  precodeltpreference namebackgroundColor value0x000000 gt codepre  pEverything without luck.p  pHow can I solve this I think that the easyest way out of here is to set the webview to black but my preference command is not working.p
Negative 15899 pIm well aware that there are questions that ask this but I am not allowed to comment on any of them and in any case my question is a little different from those. I am trying to get a custom error message from a validation, where the custom error message does not have to begin with the attribute being validated.p  pMy attribute is called formperson and represents the name of the person filling in a form a legal requirement for the site Im working on. So I havep  precodevalidatespresenceof formperson, message We need to know who is filling in this form your name codepre  pThis used to work, as in the  would cause the message to be added to codeerrors[base]code, but now its not, and I get Form person We need to know who is filling in this form your name, which is... well... less than helpful. Ive seen a solution from like 2 years ago that involves messing around with the localization files, but that is honestly the last place in the entire world that I or any of the rest of our staff might look for a validation message, seeing as were not localized at all. I know I can just write a custom validator method and thats probably what Im going to have to do, but I dont like to do that because its messy and needlessly pollutes the model namespace with extraneous methods. Theres already the codevalidatespresenceofcode method Ive looked all over the rails guides including the edge one and theres no mention of any way of doing this except via custom validator or ugh a custom validation class separate. Just checking for the presence of an attribute hardly seems like an appropriate thing to write a whole separate validator class for, so how can I do this conveniently in one succinct line like I used to be able top

Negative 15899 pI have a java map  that I would like to serialize with my own custom serialization logic. Note that java map itself is the toplevel object.p  ol liI want to output it as a collection rather than map only for above parameterized map type. All other map types should work as default i.e. MyCustomObject could have Map which should work as usual.li liI want to omit certain keyvalue from serialization based on some property value inside MyCustomObject.li liMyCustomObject is already given to me and is not in my control.li ol  pIs there anyway to achieve this in jackson Also, what about deserialization  in this case, I will want a map  back rather than collection.p

Negative 15899 pNo Jquery, just plain XMLHttpRequest.p  pSo the flow is a pretty intuitive one. User has a profile and can change his selection of that form whenever he wants.

Negative 15899 pHow can we achieve a lazylist like appearance for Images coming from Parse.com p  pNormally, in a lazylist, the images would come via a temporary folder on the SDCard through a URL. That gives the active and working feel to the user.p  pWhereas, if we were to attach an Imageview directly with an image in Parse, then it keeps waiting till the complete image is loaded and only then will it show. This gives a slow and breakinservice kind of appearance to the user.p  pAny suggestions on what is the best approach  if we were to go for a Parse based data and image storage.p

Negative 15899 pI just recently started making a VST Host and for that im using the VST.NET library for C. Now im trying to create the routing between the Line in, through the Plugins and to the Line Out. My plan is to record the audio in the host and sent the recorded buffer live when recorded not saving a temporary file to the first plugin. The output of the first Plugin which will be an Effects Plugin will the go live to the next plugin. After it got routed through all necessary plugins it should be routed to an audio output device.p  pFor the recording part i already took a look at NAudio and created the recording part like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15101889hearingtheincomingaudiofrommicthisa. Now i can get the Audio Buffer in my isDataAvailable method in the form of a byte array. Problem being that VST.NET uses the ProcessReplacing method i think to process audio to a plugin and this method requires a buffer in form of an instance of a VstAudioBuffer Array and the constructor of VstAudioBuffer requires a float buffer.p  pNow how should i convert those variables to send them to the plugin Also in the end how can i then convert them back to send to WaveOutp  pAnother question Can i, after i call plugin1.processreplacing to send the recorded data to plugin1 call plugin2.processreplacing with the parameters inputBuffer being the outputbuffer of the processreplacingcall to plugin1 to send the processed audio to plugin2p  pI tried to modify the example from the link and made thisp  precodevoid waveInDataAvailableobject sender, WaveInEventArgs e              if waveProvider  null             waveProvider.AddSamplese.Buffer, 0, e.BytesRecorded         int bytesRead  waveProvider.ReadnaudioBuf,0,e.BytesRecorded         naudioBuf  e.Buffer          unsafe                      fixed byte byteBuf  ampnaudioBuf[0]                              float floatBuf  floatbyteBuf                 for int i  0 i lt e.BytesRecorded i                                      vstBufIn[0][i]  floatBuf  i                                                 cont.PluginCommandStub.MainsChangedtrue         cont.PluginCommandStub.StartProcess         cont.PluginCommandStub.ProcessReplacingvstBufIn, vstBufOut         cont.PluginCommandStub.StopProcess         cont.PluginCommandStub.MainsChangedfalse          unsafe                      float tmpBufL  IDirectBufferAccess32vstBufOut[0].Buffer             byte[] buffer  BitConverter.GetBytestmpBufL             waveOutProv.AddSamplesbuffer, 0, buffer.Length               codepre  pThe setup for WaveIn and Out looks like thisp  precode        WaveIn waveIn  new WaveInthis.Handle         waveIn  new WaveInthis.Handle         waveIn.BufferMilliseconds  25         waveIn.DataAvailable  waveInDataAvailable          waveProvider  new BufferedWaveProviderwaveIn.WaveFormat         waveOutProv  new BufferedWaveProviderwaveIn.WaveFormat          waveOut  new WaveOut         waveOut.DesiredLatency  100         waveOut.InitwaveOutProv          waveIn.StartRecording         waveOut.Play          this.sampleRate  44100         this.channels  2         this.blockSize  4410          cont.PluginCommandStub.SetBlockSizeblockSize         cont.PluginCommandStub.SetSampleRatefloatsampleRate          vstBufManIn  new VstAudioBufferManagerchannels, blockSize  channels         vstBufManOut  new VstAudioBufferManagerchannels, blockSize  channels          vstBufIn  vstBufManIn.ToArray         vstBufOut  vstBufManOut.ToArray          naudioBuf  new byte[blockSize  channels  4] codepre  pIm getting an output and it also gets louder when the input in the mic is louder but its just a weird clicking noise.

Negative 15899 pPython 3 appears to be slower in enumerations for a minimum loop than Python 2 by a significant margin, which appears to be getting worse with newer versions of Python 3.p  pI have Python 2.7.6, Python 3.3.3, and Python 3.4.0 installed on my 64bit windows machine, Intel i72700K  3.5 GHz with both 32bit and 64bit versions of each Python installed.  While there is no significant difference in execution speed between 32bit and 64bit for a given version within its limitations as to memory access, there is a very significant difference between different version levels.  Ill let the timing results speak for themselves as followsp  precodeCPython3464python mtimeit n 5 r 2 scnt  0 for i in range10000000 cnt  1 5 loops, best of 2 900 msec per loop  CPython3364python mtimeit n 5 r 2 scnt  0 for i in range10000000 cnt  1 5 loops, best of 2 820 msec per loop  CPython2764python mtimeit n 5 r 2 scnt  0 for i in range10000000 cnt  1 5 loops, best of 2 480 msec per loop codepre  pSince the Python 3 range is not the same as Python 2s range, and is functionally the same as Python 2s xrange, I also timed that as followsp  precodeCPython2764python mtimeit n 5 r 2 scnt  0 for i in xrange10000000 cnt  1 5 loops, best of 2 320 msec per loop codepre  pOne can easily see that version 3.3 is almost twice as slow as version 2.7 and Python 3.4 is about 10 slower than that again.p  pMy question  Is there an environment option or setting that corrects this, or is it just inefficient code or the interpreter doing more for the Python 3 versionp  hr  pThe answer seems to be that Python 3 uses the infinite precision integers that used to be called long in Python 2.x its default int type without any option to use the Python 2 fixed bitlength int and it is processing of these variable length ints that is taking the extra time as discussed in the answers and comments below.p  pIt may be that Python 3.4 is somewhat slower than Python 3.3 because of changes to memory allocation to support synchronization that slightly slow memory allocationdeallocation, which is likely the main reason that the current version of long processing runs slower.p
Negative 15899 pWPF controls dont seem to have a code.Culturecodeproperty, or any other obvious way of controlling how text is localised.  Worse, on my test machine it doesnt even respect the system locale.  My application needs to work for Germans, so the test machine runs a German version of windows and C respects this.  Thus    p  precodeString.Format0, 3.5  3,5 codepre  pBut if I leave the localisation to WPF, e.g. by binding a numeric property directly to a label or a datagrid cell, I see some kind of American formatting.  So if I format code3.5code as currency then I would see code3.50code onscreen.p  pSop  ul liWhy does WPF use the wrong locale li liHow do I fix it li ul  pIdeally fix means making it respect the system locale by default, while giving me explict control over particular things.

Negative 15899 pThis question is going to be rather long, for which I apologise in advance. Hopefully it will nonetheless be clear I am trying to build a scraper in VBA that extracts patent forward citations from Google Patents. p  pTo do this I have two Excel worksheets. In Sheetsrecentpatents a bunch of patent numbers are storedp  precodecolumn A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 column B 6793915 6797730 6805855 6808712 6812240 6815452 6818218 6818642 6824791 6828324 codepre  pThe second Sheetsrecout contains 7 columns A to G that need be filled with extracted datap  precodeA Progress B Input patent C  fwd cites  D fwdcite E appdate F grantdate G Control Patent codepre  pThe tricky part for me is that every patent gets cited a different number of times so that I have to build a loop that looks for the same data fwdcite, appdate,grantdate in codeinnerHTMLcode and the number of iterations of this loop is always different.p  pSo I thought to split up the problem into two different functions codecitecountcode and codeextractcitescode. The former opens the relevant webpage and extracts the number of forward citations and stores this in the variable codeccountcode while the second function could then loop through 1 to ccount. Both functions are at the moment placed within the codeSub CountForwardCitescodep  pThis I think forces me to to put a codeCall extractcitescode within a loop which always gives me an error. p  pHere is the current code p  precode  Private Sub CountForwardCitesClick  First you need to announce the needed variables  Dim ie As Object Dim patent As String Dim ccount As Integer Dim patentnumber As String Dim theHTMLToParse As String Dim fwdcite As String Dim appdate As String Dim grantdate As String  Worksheetsrecentpatents.Select  Creating an input row where the data is sourced from  inputrow  1  Do  DoEvents  inputrow  inputrow  1  patentnumber  Sheetsrecentpatents.RangeB amp inputrow.Value   Call citecountpatentnumber, patent, ccount, fwdcite, appdate, grantdate    Step 1 Repeat patentnumber ccount times, add control patent, and ccount         Worksheetsrecout.Select             sumcount  Sheetsrecout.RangeBB.Cells.SpecialCellsxlCellTypeConstants.Count  this ensures the code does not always start filling up columns from row 2             countrows  sumcount             If ccount gt 0 Then                 Do                 DoEvents                 countrows  countrows  1                 Sheetsrecout.RangeA amp countrows  Sheetsrecentpatents.RangeA amp inputrow.Value                 Sheetsrecout.RangeB amp countrows  patentnumber                 Sheetsrecout.RangeC amp countrows  countrows  sumcount                 Sheetsrecout.RangeG amp countrows  patent                     Call GetForwardCitestheHTMLToParse, fwdcte, appdate, grantdate                      Step 2 Get the patent citations                     Call extractcitespatentnumber, theHTMLToParse, fwdcite, appdate, grantdate                         Sheetsrecout.RangeD amp countrows  fwdcite                         Sheetsrecout.RangeE amp countrows  grantdate                         Sheetsrecout.RangeF amp countrows  appdate                 Loop Until countrows  ccount  sumcount              Else                 countrows  countrows  1                 Sheetsrecout.RangeB amp countrows  patentnumber                 Sheetsrecout.RangeC amp countrows  ccount                 Sheetsrecout.RangeD amp countrows  ccount                 Sheetsrecout.RangeE amp countrows  NA                 Sheetsrecout.RangeF amp countrows  NA             End If   Loop Until inputrow  22500   End Sub codepre  pStep 1 seems to work fine as it indeed returns the desired values.

I checked that the query params DataTables is sending are correct, and they are, however, the model binder refuses to bind the innermost objects. It correctly allocates the arrays with the correct number of objects ten for columns, one for order, but the objects inside the lists are defaultconstructed, no values are being bound.p  pJust for completeness, heres the actual request DataTables makesp  precodedraw1 columns[0][data]FirstName columns[0][name]FirstName columns[0][searchable]true columns[0][orderable]true columns[0][search][value] columns[0][search][regex]false columns[1][data]LastName columns[1][name]LastName columns[1][searchable]true columns[1][orderable]true columns[1][search][value] columns[1][search][regex]false columns[2][data]Title columns[2][name]Title columns[2][searchable]true columns[2][orderable]true columns[2][search][value] columns[2][search][regex]false columns[3][data]Email columns[3][name]Email columns[3][searchable]true columns[3][orderable]true columns[3][search][value] columns[3][search][regex]false columns[4][data]Organization columns[4][name]Organization columns[4][searchable]true columns[4][orderable]true columns[4][search][value] columns[4][search][regex]false columns[5][data]StateAcronym columns[5][name]StateAcronym columns[5][searchable]true columns[5][orderable]true columns[5][search][value] columns[5][search][regex]false columns[6][data]DateAdded columns[6][name]DateAdded columns[6][searchable]true columns[6][orderable]true columns[6][search][value] columns[6][search][regex]false columns[7][data]DateRemoved columns[7][name]DateRemoved columns[7][searchable]true columns[7][orderable]true columns[7][search][value] columns[7][search][regex]false columns[8][data]ExternalReference columns[8][name]ExternalReference columns[8][searchable]true columns[8][orderable]true columns[8][search][value] columns[8][search][regex]false columns[9][data]9 columns[9][name] columns[9][searchable]false columns[9][orderable]false columns[9][search][value] columns[9][search][regex]false order[0][column]0 order[0][dir]asc start0 length10 search[value] search[regex]false codepre  pDoes anyone have an idea as to why this wouldnt workp  pstrongEDITstrong I just realized that the problem is that the serialized data is in the form codecolumn[i][attribute]code instead of codecolumn[i].attributecode. It serializes correctly when using a codeDictionaryltString, Stringgtcode instead of a specialized model, however I lose all type information. Id still like to make this work with actual models, so I guess my options are either to find a way to make the model binder do it for me or write a custom one, or alter the way the data is serialized on the client side. p

Negative 15899 pHow can I more efficiently write out an emif  elseem conditional that uses the same variable and a huge amount of OR operators p  pIve been banging my head on the desk trying to think of a way around writing out all of these OR operators with the same comparison. emForem loops wont do the trick, and Im pretty certain that a emdo  whileem loop wouldnt do it either.

Negative 15899 pBasic Problem I created a Game with 3 States, each State is started by a method within the same Class. Each Method calls panel.removeAll on the static panel, that shows the game content and then i add the buttons, background etc again to the Panel. In the first Loop by loop i mean the sequence of all 3 States where called once by each other, everything works just fine.p  pWhen State 3 calls State 1 again, so when the second Loop starts the following problem occurs When i hit a JButton, the Action is performed TWICE. In the third loop its performed three timesp  pSo whats my Problem in here Is it so, that i add the buttons multiple times, by removeAll and panel.addJButton againp  pIf so, whats the way around it Should i create different Panels and set them invisiblevisible one at a time Wouldnt that cause heavy Weight on the processor by having all graphics loaded all the timep  pThanks for your Helpp  pEDIT  Here is an examplep  precodepackage sscc  import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener  import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel  public class stuff extends JFrame implements ActionListener       static stuff frame  new stuff     static JPanel panel  new JPanel       public static void mainString[] args         Setting up the Frame in MainMethod.

Negative 15899 pExperts...p  pI have a stored procedure where I am trying to write records to a temporary table.  As a first step I want to unconditionally drop the temporary table it may not exist, then recreate the table based on a ztable table we have.  Essentially, Im after an empty table that is a duplicate layout of one particular table for comparisons later.p  pI tried a simple DROP TABLE but this its a showstopper if the table doesnt already exist. I found a way, from here, to create another stored procedure that looks in MTABLES for the temporary table, and drops it if theres a record for it.  I did that.  All good.p  pThe problem is that my SP to drop the table will drop it, but the CREATE TABLE that comes next reacts as if its still there with SAP DBTech JDBC [288] cannot use duplicate table name.  After several tests, I confirmed the droptable storedprocedure does work as expected.p  pI thought maybe I should add a commit but I get a compile error that the feature is not supported.p  pThese next two lines are the pertinent code.p  precodeCALL SCHEMA1.ZPRDROPTABLESCHEMA2, ZTBCVSCMAGGRFRESH  CREATE TABLE SCHEMA2.ZTBCVSCMAGGRFRESH AS         select  from SCHEMA1.ZTBCVSCMAGGR WITH NO DATA codepre  pstrongThe drop storeprocedurestrongp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE SCHEMA1.ZPRDROPTABLE schemaname VARCHAR250, tablename VARCHAR250 LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT AS BEGIN     declare sch varchar250     declare tab varchar250     declare cnt int  0      sch  trimupperschemaname     tab  trimuppertablename      select count into cnt from PUBLIC.MTABLES where schemaname  sch and tablename  tab      if cnt gt 0 then         exec DROP TABLE sch.tab     end if  End codepre  pMy work around is to run the droptablestoredprocedure manually.

Negative 15899 pI have two applications, a standard javaspring web app and a spring rest api in reality, I have several rest apis, some of which are ideal for sharing across several web apps, but that doesnt change the example. When a user logs into the webapp, I want them to be able to seamlessly also make ajax calls GET and POST to the rest api, which is also secured with CAS. p  pSo far it seems like the suggested approach for this is to get a proxy granting ticket in the webapp, and use it to generate a ticket that could be used to call the rest api. This however means that ajax calls made from the client page have to be proxied through the web app. p  pAre there any other means available to make this happen without the proxy through the webapp Not all the rest endpoints are secured some are meant to be public and I realize I can cut down on the use of the proxy by directly using the rest api for those, but still, it feels heavy having to double the processing for the other requests. p  pOne idea I had, which I dont know if its possible, is instead of proxying through the webapp, what if the webapp could return the proxy ticket to client, and then the ajax calls could me made with that Seems like thats not recommended thoughp

Negative 15899 pIs it possible to manually send codeEPOLLINcode event to codeepollcode for socket file descriptor without writing data to the socketp  pMaybe it is possible to use codefcntlcode or codeioctlcode to stop codeepollwaitcode function, isnt itp  pemUPDATEemp  pI understand that in most cases it does not make sense to do this, but I think it does make sense in my case.p  pIm writing a network plugin for a program, which I cannot modify. The plugin API gives me a socket FD and tells me to write a function to read codencode bytes from the socket. I use codesslreadcode function from the codepolarsslcode library for this, which reads all the data into its own inner buffer, that is more than codencode bytes.p  pWhat happens in the program The program waits codeepollwaitcode when the socket receives data and then tells the plugin to read about 4kB of data. And then it waits for the next data to be received by the socket. When the socket receives 12kB of data, the program calls the codereadcode function within the plugin, which reads all the data with codesslreadcode function. As a result, theres no more data available for the socket, but the codepolarsslcode library has its own buffer, which has about 8kB of data available.p  pSo now I need to tell the program to call the codereadcode function of the plugin, which is not going to read data from the socket directly, but is going to read data from inner codepolarsslcode buffer.p

Negative 15899 pI need to display the status of the ethernet connection eth0 on the GUI, i.e. is the link up or not. I have a Davicom DM9000 PHY.p  pI know there are various ways to skin this cat, like parsing ifconfig, polling sysclassneteth0operstate, etc.p  pHowever, as I will need to monitor other devices also, like USB, I would like to use libudev for this as a more generic implementation.  Furthermore, I would like to use the monitor mechanism using a select  and in doing so prevent having to poll. I have wrapped the libudev functionality in a Qt class and intend on using signalslot mechanisms to indicate events to my program.p  pProblem is, I cant seem to generate UDEV events from eth0 no matter what. I have also tried usingp  precodeudevadm monitor codepre  pbut no events either when unplugging my ethernet cable.p  pI dont think my code is too far off, because I am able to generate events for USB hidraw devices by unplugging my keyboard, for example. Also, I am able to see eth0s attributes using the libudev enumerate mechanism but this is a polling processp  pMy question  is this possible, i.e. to use libudevs udevmonitor functions to catch events on eth0p  pSorry for the long post.p

It recognizes that codevaluecode is appropriately used in the exception message. But, if I acquire the value as a local variable some other way within the method, ReSharper seems to complain about the code it generates, claiming that emCannot resolve symbol valueem. This sort of makes sense, because the codevaluecode is a local variable, so a consumer capturing the exception message has no idea what codevaluecode really is. Is there a more authoritative guideline on what to put in the codeArgumentOutOfRangeExceptioncode from MSDN or ECMA I ask because Im already trying to follow the guidelines when it comes to things such as naming, abbreviations, etc.p

Negative 15899 pSo for an assignment Ive been asked to create a function that will generate an array of fibonacci numbers and the user will then provide an array of random numbers. My function must then check if the array the user has entered contains any fibonacci numbers then the function will output true, otherwise it will output false. I have already been able to create the array of Fib numbers and check it against the array that the user enters however it is limited since my Fib array has a max size of 100.p  precodebool hasFibNum int arr[], int size  int fibarray[100] fibarray[0]  0 fibarray[1]  1 bool result  false for int i  2 i lt 100 i      fibarray[i]  fibarray[i1]  fibarray[i2]    for int i  0 i lt size i      forint j  0 j lt 100 j         if fibarray[j]  arr[i]             result  true        return result  codepre  pSo basically how can I make it so that I dont have to use int fibarray[100] and can instead generate fib numbers up to a certain point. That point being the maximum number in the users array.p  pSo for example if the user enters the array 4,2,1,8,21, I need to generate a fibarray up to the number 21 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21. If the user enters the array 1,4,10 I would need to generate a fibarray with 1,1,2,3,5,8,13p  pQuite new to programming so any help would be appreciated Sorry if my code is terrible.p
Negative 15899 pIBM Worklight 6.2 docs  recommend shutting off access from outside networks to Worklight Console and AppCenter console as a means of securing it.

Trying to access it from the internet returns an Unauthorized error prompting me to enter name and password, but not letting any further.p  pHowever, the installer apps within AppCenter are being accessed through appcenterconsoleinstallers.html. This means in this setup the user will no longer be able to access them. Also, the installer itself uses applicationcenter as its backend, i.e. it should be open. I can open access to this one, but I surely dont want to open access to appcenterconsole. As a workaround, I put a single installer at applicationcenter and pointed applicationcenterinstallers.html to there. The installer is now downloaded without AppCenter being involved and thus not being managed by AppCenter for any updates.p  pAre there any recommended practices to both secure the appcenterconsole and to open access for users to download installers, so that they are managed by AppCenterp  pOtherwise, will the installer app be managed by AppCenter if its installed by a direct download rather than through the AppCenter, but if it also exists in AppCenterp

Negative 15899 pI would love to create a fiddle for this to show but im using php and it wont let me use php in those so im hoping someone will still know whats going onp  pI have a javascript that works completely fine on its own.  It is a HTML click and drag canvas.  The click and drag is constrained to a circle and draws the image to the canvas when you click a button that is next to the canvas.  This button calls a method that draws the image onto the canvas and makes it click and draggable.  I have tested this by itself and it works beautifully.  When I add a simple line of php code my click and drag canvas quits moving the image.  When you click the button to draw the image on, that works, but then you cant move the image.  p  pI am beyond confused because the php that i am using has nothing to do with what is going on in the canvas.  Here is the code p  pits also important to point out that this code works fine in safari but doesnt work at all in chrome so i know it has something to do with chrome i just dont understand what the problem is. p  pMy question is mainly, is there a way that safari loads versus chrome that would affect running javascript and php on the same page since it works fine in one browser and not the other.

Negative 15899 pIm currently trying to benchmark an algorithm that pulls data from a database and performs operations on it, the function takes a little longer then Id like and I would like to benchmark it so I can monitor any performance increase as well as demonstrate it to clients. My issue is that the only documented benchmarking library is scalameter and it doesnt really go into depth of how to use it. Im quite lost in how to make a generator for a custom class called User which generates random users as inputs. Secondly, Im not quite sure how the benchmarking works with scalameter, what exactly is the Parameters type they use and how do you use it.p  pAm I even looking in the right directionp

Negative 15899 pIve written a powershell script that basically calls php WEBROOTdir  and set it to run as as WebJob in Azure  this is on an Azure Website. p  pThe problem I am having is it does not pickup the .user.ini file that is configured and working on the Website. Ive been playing around with powershell in kudu and am at wits end on how to get this to work.p  pIs there anyway to launch php in a away that is can append a user.ini file to the standard php.ini file Otherwise my only solution I can think of so far is to read the entire php.ini in DProgram Filesxxx, copy it, append to it and execute php with my modified version. This isnt an ideal solution and Im trying to get around it if possible.p  pAlternatively, the other way around it is to declare using iniset the variables I want to change at run time but the problem with this not all my vars are set  in particularly errorreporting. If someone can help me work out a way to turn off ESTRICT amp ENOTICE it would also solve my problem. Ive tried errorreporting0 and all the different way but it completely ignores them  it works fine with date.timezone, includepath, etc.p

Negative 15899 pIm using scikitlearns codeRandomForestRegressorcode to build a model for one of my datasets, along with codeGridSearchCVcode to determine model hyperparameters. I evaluate the predictive capability of the model by splitting the total dataset into train and test sets with an 8020 split. Model selection using the grid search is performed on the train set and the best model is then used to predict on the test set. Im consistently seeing that the CV R2 score for the best grid searched model is lower than the R2 score when using that model to predict the independent test data. This persists across multiple random traintest splits.

Negative 15899 pI read that C compilers must allocate 2 bytes for the type emshortem and must allocate 4 bytes for the type emlongem. So, depending on the system the type emintem can have 2 bytes or 4 bytes.

Negative 15899 pTo be brief, I am working on a realtime multiplayer game. In my game, the clients send updated position and velocity data to the server at a frequency of 20Hz. In the example code below, I am converting data from a Lua table into a C struct using LuaJIT FFI. Its a nifty way of transporting data over a networkp  precodeself.dtf  self.dtf  dt if self.dtf gt self.tickf and self.id then     self.dtf  self.dtf  self.tickf      local player  self.players[self.id]     local data             type           packets[playerupdatef],         id             self.id,         positionx     player.position.x,         positiony     player.position.y,         positionz     player.position.z,         velocityx     player.velocity.x,         velocityy     player.velocity.y,         velocityz     player.velocity.z,           local struct  cdatasetstructplayerupdatef, data     local encoded  cdataencodestruct     self.clientsendencoded end codepre  pWhen the server receives the packet, it tries to adjust the data to compensate for the latency between that particular client and itselfp  precodelocal player         self.players[id] player.position      update.position     or player.position player.velocity      update.velocity     or player.velocity  local server  self.server.connection.socket local peer    servergetpeerid local ping    peerroundtriptime  2  1000  player.position  player.position  player.velocity  ping codepre  pOnce the data is normalized, it then broadcasts the updated position info to all other clientsp  precodelocal data       type           packets[playerupdatef],     id             id,     positionx     player.position.x,     positiony     player.position.y,     positionz     player.position.z,     velocityx     player.velocity.x,     velocityy     player.velocity.y,     velocityz     player.velocity.z,  local struct   cdatasetstructplayerupdatef, data local encoded  cdataencodestruct self.serversendencoded codepre  pWhen the other clients finally get the packet, they adjust the data based on their latency with the serverp  precodeif id  self.id then     self.players[id]           self.players[id] or      self.players[id].position  update.position  or self.players[id].position     self.players[id].velocity  update.velocity  or self.players[id].velocity      local ping  self.client.connection.peerroundtriptime  2  1000     self.players[id].position  self.players[id].position  self.players[id].velocity  ping end codepre  pSo herein lies the problem The objects are very jittery.

Negative 15899 pAlright, so my question is pretty straight forward, I want to know how if possible to hide or show an codeAdViewcode from the core project of a LibGDX project. This would be used to only show the ad banner in the Menu screen of the game.p  pNow, before you link the official wiki a hrefhttpsgithub.comlibgdxlibgdxwikiAdmobinlibgdxcontrol relnofollowarticlea explaining how to do it, I want to specify that I did read it, but I dont want to simply do codeAdView.setVisibilityView.GONEcode since it would create bad ad impressions.p  pThe codeAdViewcode is currently added to a codeRelativeLayoutcode along with another codeViewcode which contains the actual game elements. This codeRelativeLayoutcode is set as the content view of my MainActivity.p  pI am hoping there would be a way to remove the codeAdViewcode from the codeRelativeLayoutcode in order to only have the codeViewcode containing the game. Also Im not sure if it would be necessary to destroy the AdView so it doesnt load any ad in the background or if a simple codesetEnabledfalsecode would be enough.p  pEvidently I would like to be able to also do the opposite and replace the codeAdViewcode into the codeRelativeLayoutcode.p

Lets say I send Jonh to the server. Then, my idea is to retrieve data from the datastore so that all the users whose name begins with John e.g. John Doe and live closer to me are rendered first.p  pSo far my query doesnt consider the location perspective and is as followsp  pqry  User.queryUser.Name  givenusername.orderUser.Namep  pI think one alternative would consist in using the Python Search API. If Im correct, then I must first generate a search document, structure data using fields, index the document and, finally, use the mentioned API.p  pDo you think this is the way to go I feel like there is simpler way to address this question. For example, using the list of stored text locations could help, but in this case I wouldve to manually sort, because of the query limitations of GAE, and query to the datastore several times to get all the data.p

Negative 15899 pI have a project to do for my master degree and I need to do a java app which load a file read some attributes and copy the file to a working directory, basically any file, and make the working directory private. By private I mean to hide in a way that directory from any OS well, bascially Windows and Linux. Im not sure that the OS Windows and Linux functions to hide directories work because an adminsuperuser can modify those settings and easily access my files. p  pThe idea for the project is to have exclusive access to those loaded files from within the app and to make them available for the aplications installed locally to openrun them like Open in media player, which should work also when I copy the app to a USB stick. I have 2 options  1 modify each file after loading to make unreadable to the world and undo the modifications each time I press Open from within the app  2 which i think is the best and most simple option Modify the root directory of those files root  the working directory or some subdirectory of it to be unreadableunaccessible to the world while outside the app and readable to the app at the runtime.p  pIve been thinking about something like making a locally encripted copy of filesystem attributes of the directory, delete them while not at app runtime and put them back while at app runtime. But I didnt really played with this before and also WindowsampLinux filesystems arent simple at all. More of it, a USB stick have a FAT filesystem which if Im not wrong belongs to DOS, which is, yeah, another filesystem into the equation.p  pIm almost sure it is not feasible and not secure to simply play back and forth with the filesystem as my pleasure, so I need some ideas to find that breakthrough without actually breaking anything.p  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong Ive found a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase8docstechnotesguidesiofspfilesystemprovider.html relnofollowthisa in the SE8 docs while searching for something helpfull in the java library. As soon as Im not interested of reinventing the wheel of filesystems, just to make some little tricks with mine, it might provide what I need.p

Negative 15899 pTo the Parse user out there. For an iOS app using Parsep  pHow do you solve for Email Address  Phone Number invited versus Email Address  Phone Number signedup problem p  pThe background on the app is that users create groups and can invite new people to the app and group within the app. Say, you invited a user at abcabc.com but they register with xyzxyz.com. How do you then link this users with the group they were initially invited to, and the ghost account that was created on their behalf so they could be used in the group as an entity until they registeredp  pThe only clean solution I foresee is to allow a user account to add multiple EmailSMS IDs in their profile.

Negative 15899 pa newbie to Meteor, but I have created under localhost a simple passenger counter I intend to use on an android app for a passenger survey holding a laptop in an airport isnt a particularly wise idea.

Negative 15899 pIm facing some issues when Im trying to deal with codeIBindingListcode inherited collections that are modified by a nonUI codeThreadcode and are at the same time bound to the codeDataSourcecode Property of some Winforms Controls e.g. an old fashion codeDataGridViewcode.p  pMy point is that codeInvoke  Begincode are not suitable in my solution, cause the collections are not supposed to be really aware of the controls they are bound to.p  pIs there any other elegant solution than passing the UI codeDispatchercode or the appropriate codeSynchronizationContextcode reference to the collection which is going to be modified later onp  pI was thinking about how one can detect whether that the current codeThreadcode is the UI accessing to the collection If could know that,  therefore I could select emto dispatch or notem the collection modifications to the UI codeThreadcode. This solution still does not prevent to pass the reference of the UI codeSynchronizationContextcode or codeDispatchercode, though. p  pIt would be nice to have real static properties which could give access, instead we have codeDispatcher.CurrentDispatchercode and codeWinformsSynchronizationContextcode that actually cannot be accessed from another thread... dont really get the point of the design if we still need to pass the reference from the UI codeThreadcode then. But I guess there is some reasons behind the scenes.p  pI may misunderstood and twist the definitions of some terms, so feel free to correct me if thats the case. I do not want to pretend that Im expert or whatsoever.p  pThe fact that delegating systematically everything to the UI seems a bit too much and might somehow overload the message pump cause in this scenario it would be better to create the collection right beforehand within the UI scope but then it would loose the interest of delegating the modifications among several threads.p  pI know that codeIBindingListcode is going to reflect through codeListChangedcode which is subscribed via the Control bound to a codeIBindingListcode inherited collection the collection changes.  Basically those changes are going to be triggered by the nonUI codeThreadcode and that basically the very bottom line. Although, Im bit frustrated by the lack of elegant solutions.p  pBy the way, I am not willing to use the asyncawait and neither some special events of the BackgroundWorker that automatically Marhsall to the UI Thread when they are triggered. Maybe I should have a look at a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.com relnofollowhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comap  pPlease find below the results of my investigations about the UI Marshallingp  precodepublic static class Program      [STAThread]     public static void Mainparams String[] arguments              var bindingList  new BindingListltRecordgt          ActionltObjectgt action  argument gt                      var synchronizationContext  argument as SynchronizationContext             var dispatcher  argument as Dispatcher              if synchronizationContext  null ampamp dispatcher  null                              throw new ArgumentExceptionargument                          else                              var random  new Random                  while true                                      ActionltObjectgt sendOrPostCallbackAction  state gt                                              var record  new Record                         bindingList.Addrecord                                           var sendOrPostCallback  new SendOrPostCallbacksendOrPostCallbackAction                       WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.Current.SendsendOrPostCallback, new Object                       NullReferenceException                       Object reference not set to an instance of an object...

Negative 15899 pIm trying to create a pure C OpenGL application bundle .app instead of a plain commandline executable. Im trying to avoid directly using ObjC or Cocoa, though I am using GLFW which requires linking with Cocoa.framework.p  pI was able to accomplish this by selecting the emCocoa Applicationem template and gutting everything except Info.plist and replacing main.m with main.cpp, but going through that process is pretty annoying. Plus, could there be important project setting differences between the emCocoa Applicationem and emCommand Line Toolem templates that affect performancebinary size Their build settings are pretty similar, so maybe Im in the clear.p  pAnyway, I have a couple optionsp  ol liKeep doing what Im doing works, but annoyingli liGenerate application bundle from emCommand Line Applicationem template nicer, but not sure if possibleli ol  pIf the answer is 1, Ill probably end up creating a custom target template.p
Negative 15899 pI came out to scala programmin from Java so its not clear to me how we should use relative imports in Scala and what is the exact name lookup rules Suppose I have the followingp  precodepack.age        MyClass.scala  com.age        AnotherClass.scala codepre  pI need to import codeMyClass.scalacode into codeAnotherClass.scalacode.

Here is an examplep  precodemodule Lens  struct   type a, b t       get  a gt b     set  b gt a gt a    end  type car     vendor string   make string   mileage int   let vendorlens     Lens.get  fun x gt x.vendor   Lens.set  fun v x gt  x with vendor  v   codepre  pThe codevendorlenscode allows us to get the value of the field codevendorcode in our codecarcode and to update it  which means returning a fresh copy of the codecarcode differing from the original only by the value of the codevendorcode car.  This might at first sound very embanalem but it is not since lenses are essentially functions, they can be composed and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comavsmocamllens relnofollowLensesa module is filled with useful functions.  The ability to compose accessors is crucial in complex code bases, as it eases the decoupling by abstracting the path from a computation context to a deeply nested record.  I also recently refactored my a hrefhttpsgithub.commichipiligetopts relnofollowGetoptsa and a hrefhttpsgithub.commichipiliconfiguration relnofollowconfiguration file parsera to adopt a functional interface, which makes lenses even more relevant  at least for me.p  h2Generating lensesh2  pThe definition of codevendorlenscode above is nothing more than a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBoilerplatecode relnofollowboilerplate codea and there is really no reason one could not take advantage of PPXrewriters to let us simply writep  precodetype car     vendor string   make string   mileage int  [withlenses] codepre  pand see automagically definition of the lenses we need to work with our car.p  pI decided to tackle the problem and could producep  ol lipa predicate codeisrecord  Parsetree.structureitem gt boolcode recognising type record definitions.pli lipa function codelabeldeclarations  Parsetree.structureitem gt string listcode maybe returning the list of record declarations for a record definition  emyes, we could smash 1 and 2 together using an optionem.pli lipa function codelensexpr  string gt  Parsetree.structureitemcode generating the lens definition for a given field declaration. Unfortunately I discovered a hrefhttpsgithub.comalainfrischppxtoolsppxmetaquot relnofollowppxmetaquota by Alain Frisch after I wrote this function.pli ol  pIt seems to me I have here the essential parts of the PPXrewriter I want to write. Still, how can I combine them togetherp  hr  p  While searching for a PPXrewriter for lenses, I stumbled on not less than five blogs or READMEs involving the very same codecarcode structure. Recycling this example here is a vile attempt to look like a fulltime member of the selective club of lensequipped car drivers.  p

Negative 15899 pI have a NodeJS API web server lets call it WS1 that receives RESTful HTTP requests from clients, and to respond needs to first query another local server lets call it WS2.p  pThe flow is pretty much like thisp  ol liWS1 receives an HTTP request from a client and parses it.li liWS1 sends a request to WS2 for some information.li liWhen WS1 receives the response from WS2, it finishes processing the original request and sends a response back to the client.li ol  pUntil now all communication between WS1 and WS2 has been done through HTTP requests, since the two machines are on the same local network.p  pTo speed things up though Im considering to start using a hrefhttpzeromq.org relnofollowstrongzmqstronga instead. Ive looked at the patterns they show on the docs, but still havent figured out a concurrency problem.p  pWS1 can send many requests per second to WS2, and theres no guarantee that WS2 replies in the same order as it receives the requests, since some async operations can internally take longer than others.p  pSo, using zmq with NodeJS, how do I make sure that when WS1 receives a message from WS2 it knows to what original client request it belongs to Is there a builtin mechanism to take care of itp  pThanksp

Negative 15899 pThis is baffling me. Im trying to use a case statement to create a column that returns either a one or a zero depending on whether a search of two columns for a hospital siteward IS NOT in a list of values in a tablevariable, and if two columns that represent if a journey to said hospital siteward was cancelled for whatever reason. This counting column is called [Journeys Other] as it represents all ambulance journeys that took place to anywhere other than one of 4 other specific sites. This is why the case statement below is asking it to check for any hospitals and sites that arent in the predefined list.p  pThe problem is the query is not doing as I ask it for the second column [From hospital text]. Its returning 1s in the counting column where there is a match to an entry in the predefined list. It works fine for the first column [Requestee Name] as there are no matches. But the second column search might as well not exist. Its driving me mad.p  pIve plucked it out of its much bigger main query to show what Ive done so farp  precodeSELECT [Journey ID]     , [Start Date]     , [Requestee Name]     , [From hospital text]     , [Abort Reason Text]     , [CANCEL REASON TEXT]     , CASE  WHEN  [Requestee Name] NOT IN ISNULLmts.MatchingSite,           AND [From hospital text] NOT IN ISNULLmts.MatchingSite,  OR [From hospital text] IS NULL          AND COALESCE[Abort Reason Text], [CANCEL REASON TEXT] IS NULL THEN 1          ELSE 0         END AS [JOURNEYS OTHER]   From AE.dbo.PTSMDSForReporting1415  mds  LEFT JOIN MatchesReq mts                                             ON mds.[Requestee Name]  mts.MatchingSiteReq  WHERE [ECR Flag]0 AND [Service Type Text]  Pallative Day AND [CCG] in Leeds North Ccg,Leeds South And East Ccg,Leeds West Ccg AND [Start Date] gt 01JULY2014 codepre  pSo when I run this, the [Journeys Other] column created by the case statement has a 1 against rows that should not qualify for it.  p  pHere are some example rowsp  precodeJourney ID   Start Date                 Requestee Name     From hospital text       Abort Reason Text   CANCEL REASON TEXT  JOURNEYS OTHER 6630679      20140708 000000.000    Dales Ward         St Gemmas Hospice        NULL                NULL                1 6633083      20140710 000000.000    Moors Ward         St Gemmas Hospice        NULL                NULL                1 6644723      20140712 000000.000    J84 Thoracics     St James Hospital Leeds  NULL                NULL                1 6676438      20140722 000000.000    Day Unit           Wheatfields Hospice      NULL                NULL                1 6675840      20140722 000000.000    Discharge          Wheatfields Hospice      NULL                NULL                1 6694026      20140728 000000.000    Dales Ward         St Gemmas Hospice        NULL                NULL                1 6693591      20140728 000000.000    Day Unit           Bexley Wing St James   NULL                NULL                1 6693590      20140728 000000.000    Day Unit           Wheatfields Hospice      NULL                NULL                1 6695586      20140728 000000.000    Day Unit           Wheatfields Hospice      NULL                NULL                1 codepre  pAll these rows have a hospitalsite in [From hospital text] that are in the list of hospitalssites in my table variable.

The only constantly correct rows are where the match occurs in [Requestee Name] and then the 2nd AND condition either is true or not IS NULL or is NOT NULL when coalesced together. The minute it has to consider a value in BOTH columns, it doesnt always work for the 2nd of the two.p  pI cannot for the life of me figure out why the case statement doesnt behave as expected to when its comparing the table variable to the [From hospital text] column.
