The data is sent from my model to controller and to this viewp  precodeltdiv classtableresponsivegt     lttable classtable tablestriped tablebordered tablehover iddataTableslistlggt         lttheadgt             ltthgtItemIDltthgt             ltthgtNameltthgt             ltthgtQuantityltthgt             ltthgtIdentifiedltthgt             ltthgtItem Typeltthgt             ltthgtUnique IDltthgt             ltthgtDetailsltthgt         lttheadgt         lttbodygt             ltphp foreach storageitems as storageItem  gt                 lttrgt                     lttdgtltphp echo storageItem[nameid] gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltphp echo storageItem[name] gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltphp echo storageItem[amount] gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltphp echo storageItem[identify] gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltphp echo itemtypes[storageItem[type]] gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltphp echo storageItem[uniqueid] gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltcentergtlta datatogglecollapse dataparentaccordion hrefstoragedetailsltphp echo storageItem[id] gtgtltbutton typebutton classbtn btnprimary btncircle btnsmgtlti classfa faplusgtltigtltbuttongtltagtltcentergtlttdgt                     lttdgt                     ltphp   echo formopenaccountedititem, arrayclass gt forminline, arrayid gt storageItem[id], itemloc gt inventory, acctid gt acctdatagtaccountid gt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd colspan8 classhiddenRowgt                         ltdiv idstoragedetailsltphp echo storageItem[id] gt classpanelcollapse collapsegt                             ltdiv classpanelbodygt                                 ltdiv classrowgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtRefine levelltstronggtampnbspltinput typenumber namerefine classformcontrol valueltphp echo storageItem[refine] gt ltphp if storageItem[type]  4 ampamp storageItem[type]  5  echo readonly  gt gt                                     ltdivgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtBrokenltstronggtampnbspltinput typecheckbox nameattribute classformcontrol value1 ltphp if storageItem[attribute]  1  echo checked  if storageItem[type]  4 ampamp storageItem[type]  5  echo disabled  gt gt                                     ltdivgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtBoundltstronggtampnbspltinput typecheckbox namebound classformcontrol value1 ltphp if storageItem[bound]  1  echo checked  gt gt                                     ltdivgt                                 ltdivgt                                 ltbr gt                                 ltdiv classrowgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtCard 1ltstronggtampnbspltinput typenumber namecard0 classformcontrol valueltphp echo storageItem[card0] gt ltphp if storageItem[type]  4 ampamp storageItem[type]  5  echo readonly  gt gtltbrgt                                     ltdivgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtCard 2ltstronggtampnbspltinput typenumber namecard1 classformcontrol valueltphp echo storageItem[card1] gt ltphp if storageItem[type]  4 ampamp storageItem[type]  5  echo readonly  gt gtltbrgt                                     ltdivgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtCard 3ltstronggtampnbspltinput typenumber namecard2 classformcontrol valueltphp echo storageItem[card2] gt ltphp if storageItem[type]  4 ampamp storageItem[type]  5  echo readonly  gt gtltbrgt                                     ltdivgt                                     ltdiv classcolxs2gt                                         ltstronggtCard 4ltstronggtampnbspltinput typenumber namecard3 classformcontrol valueltphp echo storageItem[card3] gt ltphp if storageItem[type]  4 ampamp storageItem[type]  5  echo readonly  gt gtltbrgt                                     ltdivgt                                 ltdivgt                                 ltphp echo formclose gt                             ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt             ltphp  gt         lttbodygt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre  pThe javascript Im using now to make the table isp  precodeltscriptgt document.readyfunction      dataTableslistlg.DataTable         responsive true,         lengthMenu [ [25, 50, 100, 1], [25, 50, 100, All] ],         searching false,         defaultContent ,       ltscriptgt codepre  pWhere the codelttd colspan8 classhiddenRowgtcode is, is where I want to make the child row drop down UNDER the entry showing the additional information.

Positive 491 pFor some reason, I would like to store a ADO.NET codeDataTablecode inside a codeBsonDocumentcode, but I am surprised that the official C driver 2.0 refuses to serialize codeDataTablecode as array of codeBsonDocumentcodes. I know it is fairly easy to write your own method to do so, but this could be done in pretty generic fashion. Also, the opposite direction is pretty straightforward however since MongoDB is schemaless it could generate a lot of codeNULLcodes.p  pAm I missing something in the default driver that would allow such serialization, or I must write some boring boilerplate code which, I could reuse later, of course p

It calls the very efficient PosEx routine that was originally developed by Fastcode and is now included in the StrUtils library of Delphi.p  pI recently upgraded to Delphi 2009 and my strings are all Unicode. This GetTok function still works and still works well. p  pI have gone through the new libraries in Delphi 2009 and there are many new functions and additions to it. p  pBut I have not seen a GetToken function like I need in any of the new Delphi libraries, in the various fastcode projects, and I cant find anything with a Google search other than a hrefhttpdelphi.about.comcsadptips2002abltip09025F2.htmZarko Gajics Delphi Split  Tokenizer Functionsa, which is not as optimized as what I already have.p  pAny improvement, even 10 would be noticeable in my program. I know an alternative is StringLists and to always keep the tokens separate, but this has a big overhead memorywise and Im not sure if I did all that work to convert whether it would be any faster.p  pWhew. So after all this long winded talk, my question really isp  pDo you know of any very fast implementations of a GetToken routine An assembler optimized version would be idealp  pIf not, are there any optimizations that you can see to my code above that might make an improvementp  phrp  pFollowup Barry Kelly mentioned a question I asked a year ago about optimizing the parsing of the lines in a file. At that time I hadnt even thought of my GetTok routine which was not used for the that read or parsing. It is only now that I saw the overhead of my GetTok routine which led me to ask this question. Until Carl Smotricz and Barrys answers, I had never thought of connecting the two. So obvious, but it just didnt register. Thanks for pointing that out.p  pYes, my Delim is a single character, so obviously I have some major optimization I can do. My use of Pos and PosEx in the GetTok routine above blinded me to the idea that I can do it faster with a character by character search instead, with bits of code likep  precode      while cp gt 0 and cp lt Delim do             Inccp codepre  pIm going to go through everyones answers and try the various suggestions and compare them. Then Ill post the results. p  phrp  pConfusion Okay, now Im really perplexed.p  pI took Carl and Barrys recommendation to go with PChars, and here is my implementationp  precodefunction GetTokconst Line string const Delim string const TokenNum Byte string  LK Feb 12, 2007  This function has been optimized as best as possible   LK Nov 7, 2009  Reoptimized using PChars instead of calls to Pos and PosEx   See httpstackoverflow.comquestions1694001isthereafastgettokenroutinefordelphi  var  I integer  PLine, PStart PChar begin   PLine  PCharLine   PStart  PLine   incPLine   for I  1 to TokenNum do begin     while PLine ltgt 0 and PLine ltgt Delim do       incPLine     if I  TokenNum then begin       SetStringResult, PStart, PLine  PStart       break     end     if PLine  0 then begin       Result         break     end     incPLine     PStart  PLine   end end  GetTok  codepre  pOn paper, I dont think you can do much better than this.p  pSo I put both routines to the task and used AQTime to see whats happening. The run I had included 1,108,514 calls to GetTok.p  pAQTime timed the original routine at 0.40 seconds. The million calls to Pos took 0.10 seconds. A half a million of the TokenNum  1 copies took 0.10 seconds. The 600,000 PosEx calls only took 0.03 seconds.p  pThen I timed my new routine with AQTime for the same run and exactly the same calls. AQTime reports that my new fast routine took 3.65 seconds, which is 9 times as long. The culprit according to AQTime was the first loopp  precode     while PLine ltgt 0 and PLine ltgt Delim do        incPLine codepre  pThe while line, which was executed 18 million times, was reported at 2.66 seconds. The inc line, executed 16 million times, was said to take 0.47 seconds.p  pNow I thought I knew what was happening here. I had a similar problem with AQTime in a question I posed last year a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions332948whyischarinsetfasterthancasestatementWhy is CharInSet faster than Case statementa p  pAgain it was Barry Kelly who clued me in. Basically, an instrumenting profiler like AQTime does not necessarily do the job for microoptimization. It adds an overhead to each line which may swamp the results which is shown clearly in these numbers. The 34 million lines executed in my new optimized code overwhelm the several million lines of my original code, with apparently little or no overhead from the Pos and PosEx routines.p  pBarry gave me a sample of code using QueryPerformanceCounter to check that he was correct, and in that case he was.p  pOkay, so lets do the same now with QueryPerformanceCounter to prove that my new routine is faster and not 9 times slower as AQTime says it is. So here I gop  precodefunction TimeItconst Title string double var  i Integer   start, finish, freq Int64   Seconds double begin   QueryPerformanceCounterstart   for i  1 to 250000 do     GetTokOldThis is a stringthat needsparsing, , 1   for i  1 to 250000 do     GetTokOldThis is a stringthat needsparsing, , 2   for i  1 to 250000 do     GetTokOldThis is a stringthat needsparsing, , 3   for i  1 to 250000 do     GetTokOldThis is a stringthat needsparsing, , 4   QueryPerformanceCounterfinish   QueryPerformanceFrequencyfreq   Seconds  finish  start  freq   Result  Seconds end codepre  pSo this will test 1,000,000 calls to GetTok.p  pMy old procedure with the Pos and PosEx calls took 0.29 seconds. The new one with PChars took 2.07 seconds. p  pNow I am completely befuddled Can anyone tell me why the PChar procedure is not only slower, but is 8 to 9 times slowerp  phrp  pMystery solved Andreas said in his answer to change the Delim parameter from a string to a Char. Ill always be using just a Char, so at least for my implementation this is very possible. I was amazed at what happened.p  pThe time for the 1 million calls went down from 1.88 seconds to .22 seconds.p  pAnd surprisingly, the time for my original PosPosEx routine went UP from .29 to .44 seconds when I changed its Delim parameter to a Char.p  pFrankly, Im disappointed by Delphis optimizer. That Delim is a constant parameter. The optimizer should have noticed that the same conversion is happening within the loop and should have moved it out so that it would only be done once.p  pDouble checking my Code generation parameters, yes I do have Optimization True and String format checking Off.p  pBottom line is that the new PChar routine with Andreas fix is about 25 faster than my original .22 versus .29.p  pI still want to follow up on the other comments here and test them out.p  phrp  pTurning off optimization and turning on String format checking only increases the time from .22 to .30.  It adds about the same to the original.p  pThe advantage to using assembler code, or calling routines written in assembler like Pos or PosEx is that they are NOT subject to what code generation options you have set. They will always run the same way, a preoptimized and nonbloated way.p  pI have reaffirmed in the last couple of days, that the best way to compare code for microoptimization is to look at and compare the Assembler code in the CPU window. It would be nice if Embarcadero could make that window a bit more convenient, and allow us to copy portions to the clipboard or to print sections of it.p  pAlso, I unfairly slammed AQTime earlier in this post, thinking that the extra time added for my new routine was solely because of the instrumentation it added. Now that I go back and check with the Char parameter instead of String, the while loop is down to .30 seconds from 2.66 and the inc line is down to .14 seconds from .47. Strange that the inc line would go down as well. But Im getting worn out from all this testing already.p  phrp  pI took Carls idea of looping by characters, and rewrote that code with that idea. It makes another improvement, down to .19 seconds from .22. So here is now the best so farp  precodefunction GetTokconst Line string const Delim Char const TokenNum Byte string  LK Nov 8, 2009  Reoptimized using PChars instead of calls to Pos and PosEx   See httpstackoverflow.comquestions1694001isthereafastgettokenroutinefordelphi  var   I, CurToken Integer   PLine, PStart PChar begin   CurToken  1   PLine  PCharLine   PStart  PLine   for I  1 to lengthLine do begin     if PLine  Delim then begin       if CurToken  TokenNum then         break       else begin         CurToken  CurToken  1         incPLine         PStart  PLine       end     end     else       incPLine   end   if CurToken  TokenNum then     SetStringResult, PStart, PLine  PStart   else     Result   end codepre  pThere still may be some minor optimizations to this, such as the CurToken  Tokennum comparison, which should be the same type, Integer or Byte, whichever is faster.p  pBut lets say, Im happy now. p  pThanks again to the StackOverflow Delphi community.p

Negative 491 pWere about to set off our first larger WCF project, and were having some concerns on how to layer our application correctly and where all the patterns go.p  pThe services will primarily be consumed by applications on the Intranet, and secondly by customers over the Internet.p  pOur idea was to layer the application this way, inspired by a hrefhttpdomaindrivendesign.org relnofollowDDDa and Microsoft Spains a hrefhttpmicrosoftnlayerapp.codeplex.com relnofollowN Layer Appap  ul listrongInfrastructure layerstrong ul liUsing EF4 POCO, and the repository patternli ulli listrongDomain layerstrong ul liSo far we have a few domain services hereli ulli listrongApplication layerstrong ul liNothing here yetli ulli listrongDistributed services layer WCFstrong ul liThis is where the questions begin to arise.li ulli listrongPresentation layerstrongli ul  pNow we have been reading lots of material, and as an example, Fowler mentions the Remote Facade pattern and Data Transfer Objects as distribution patterns in his book Patterns of Enterprise Architecture.p  pIf I understood facades and WCF correctly, my remote facades will be the service contracts in WCF. However, Fowler has lots of these facades each of their own class like Album Service, but in WCF I only have one service contract and one class Microsoft does it in their N Layer App, calling it IMainModuleService We can of course simulate multiple facades using partial classes, but I dont feel like thats the way if you understand. But is this the way its done in WCF, or do you ignore the Remote Facade pattern completelyp  pFowler suggests that you send DTOs over the wire instead of business entities which sounds reasonable to me. But many samples that Ive seen does not do this. Do you do this in WCFbr Assuming that youre using DTOs in WCF, these would be our data contracts, right Implementing DTOs, Fowler has an example using an Album Service the facade which uses an AlbumAssembler class one pr. DTO for assembling the DTOs using the business entities. I imagine that this is done using services from the applicationdomain layerbr But where are these DTOs assembled Is this done in the application layer where some validation occurs aswell, or where does this responsibility lie I really need some guidance and best practices here which I hope you can give me.p  pThese are some of our questions at the moment which we hope that you can guide us through. Any comments on the overall architecture will also be greatly appreciated. Another question that we havent considered much yet is best practices on how to handle security in WCF using WIF, in enterprise applications. If you have any comments on that matter, please share them.p

Negative 491 pMy application needs to behave slightly differently when it loads if there is already an instance running.p  pI understand how to use a mutex to prevent additional instances loading, but that doesnt quite solve my problem.p  pFor examplep  ul liInstance 1 loads, gets the mutex.li liInstance 2 loads, cant get the mutex, knows theres another instance.  So far, so good.li liInstance 1 closes, releases the mutex.li liInstance 3 loads, gets the mutex, doesnt know that Instance 2 is still running.li ul  pAny ideas  Thankfully it doesnt need to deal with multiple user accounts or anything like that.p  pC, desktop applicationp  pEdit To clarify, the application doesnt need to be restricted to a single instance, just perform a slightly different startup action if theres another instance already running.  Multiple instances are fine and expected.p

Negative 491 pIm building a website. It has groups that users can join.p  pThe difference  between this and normal groups is that membership is temporary  when a user joins a group, he decides the length of membership 5 days, a week, 2 weeks, etc choices are predefined. Or potentially all memberships could be set to be of the same length  say a week  if that makes thing simpler.p  pId like to have a running tally of the number of members of each group. The number doesnt need to be accurate up to the last second. But it cant be emtooem out of date either  say, should be updated once a day.p  pThe obvious way to calculate the number of members seems to be running a cron job, say daily, and go through every member of every group  one by  one. If a membership has expired, remove that member from the group and decrement the groups membership count by 1.p  pThat approach seems very inefficient and not  very scalable. With a large number of groups, it  could take forever.p  pCan you think of  a better way to do this  The membership counts do not need to be  accurate to the latest second. It can be approximate and slightly out of date. Also if it makes a difference all memberships can be set to be of the same length, say a week.p

I was hoping someone here could tell me.p  pThe only real major difference I could see, aside from the php versions and environment, is that the server that the error is on is using the Suhosin Patch. But would that be something that could cause thisp  pThe line in question is codeMagegetModelmymodulemymodelgtbatchcode which is enclosed in an IF statement. codebatchcode is a public function located in my model file. p  pIf you need more code let me know. p  pThanksp

Negative 491 pA very common use case in many web applications is that domain objects can be ordered by a user in the web interface  and that order is persisted for later but Ive noticed that every time I need to implement this, I always end up coming up with a solution that is different and adds considerable weight and complexity to a simple domain object.  As an example, suppose I have the persistent entity Personp  precodePerson     long id    String name  codepre  pA user goes to codemyapppersonscode and sees all people in the system in the order in which they receive compensation or something  all of the people can be clicked and dragged and dropped into another position  when the page is loaded again, the order is remembered.  The problem is that relational databases just dont seem to have a good way of doing this nor do ORMs hibernate is what I usep  pIve been thinking of a generic ordering methodology  but there will be some overhead as the data would be persisted separately which could slow down access in some use cases.  My question is has anyone come up with a really good way to model the order of persistent domain objectsp  pI work in JavaEE with Hibernate or JDBCTemplate  so any code examples would be most useful with those technologies as their basis.  Or any conceptual ideas would be welcome too.p  pUPDATE  Im not sure where I went wrong, but it seems I was unclear as most have responded with responses that dont really match my question as it is in my head.  The problem is not how do I order rows or columns when I fetch them  it is that the order of the domain objects change  someone clicks and drags a person from the bottom of the list to the top of the list  they refresh the page and the list is now in the order they specified.p

Negative 491 pI am writing a scriptable game engine, for which I have a large number of classes that perform various tasks. The size of the engine is growing rapidly, and so I thought of splitting the large executable up into dll modules so that only the components that the game writer actually uses can be included. When the user compiles their game which is to say their script, I want the correct dlls to be part of the final executable. I already have quite a bit of overlay data, so I figured I might be able to store the dlls as part of this block. My question boils down to thisp  pIs it possible to trick LoadLibrary to start reading the file at a certain offset That would save me from having to either extract the dll into a temporary file which is not clean, or alternatively scrapping the automatic inclusion of dlls altogether and simply instructing my users to package the dlls along with their games.p  pInitially I thought of going for the load dll from memory approach but rejected it on grounds of portability and simply because it seems like such a horrible hack.p  pAny thoughtsp  pKind regards,p  pPhilip Bennefallp

Negative 491 pI have a project in visual c 2010, which contains preprocessor directives in a key header file. Actually, it is the ZMQ source code.p  pThe project is normally configured to be a dll, so the header uses DLLEXPORTs status definednot defined. If the project is used to compile a dll, the header can be used by both the dll project or the client code, thanks to the following setup taken from zmq.hp  precodeif defined WIN32    if defined DLLEXPORT        define ZMQEXPORT declspecdllexport    else        define ZMQEXPORT declspecdllimport    endif codepre  pHowever, this does not  support the setup where Im building a static library.

Negative 491 pI am indexing a set of websites which have a very large number of pages tens of millions that are generated from a small number of templates. I am looking for an algorithm to learn the templates that the pages were generated from and to match templates to pages so that I need to store only the variable part and a template reference for each page fetched. p  pThe algorithm need not produce the greatest compression possible, but it should hopefully become better as it sees more pages and it should behave gracefully when faced with a page generated using a previously unseen template.p  pI would greatly appreciate any references to literature or existing libraries.p  pI could run a general purpose compression algorithm on batches of pages. The reason I do not want to do that is that the data of interest to me would be in the variable part of the pages and so the template approach would allow me to retrive it without uncompressing. I want to able to recreate the full page if needed both to ensure future replicability and to guard against bugs in my scraping program.p

Negative 491 pI decided to have a concerted effort to get the excellent a hrefhttpcode.google.compdwscript relnofollowDWScript Delph Web Script DWSa integrated into a simple IDE using a hrefhttpsynedit.svn.sourceforge.netviewvcsynedit relnofollowSynEdita. DWScript is currently being a hrefhttpdelphitools.info relnofollowagressively developeda and has a number of advantages over other Pascal Script libraries, however it does not contain an editor or any IDE example beyond a simple memo control to prove execution capability. It does contain a number of hooks for editor  debugger integration and in fact when DWS was reawakened a while ago, releases did contain an example of a SynEdit  DWS2 as it was then integration. An example can be found in the file a hrefhttpen.sourceforge.jpprojectssfnetdwsreleases relnofollowdws2src2020030907.zipa in the dws2reldwstoolsidedialogsource where there is a miniIDE with editor window, call stack, breakpoint window etc. Really nice. I did get this working some months ago using an old SynEdit and the DWS2 that was included in this file. p  pSo, I have now tried achieve this or a similar ide using the latest SynEdit downloaded from SVN and the latest DWScript also from the SVN. Both libraries are installed fine into XE and their demos run fine. I then tried taking the ide example from the old dws2reldwstoolsidedialogsource and updating the code but much has changed. Frustratingly, not so much has changed that I gave up quickly  I tried searching for the various old type definitions in old source and matching them up with new definitions. Finally though, after several hours mired in code I decided that someone, somewhere must surely have been down this routep  pHas anyone got an example of a DWScript  SynEdit integration using recent DWScript code please Im very happy with something simple that I can learn  build upon. Thanksp

Negative 491 pI want to run a specific task in the background. This task takes few seconds to complete it writes some GPS location data to a file. This task should run once every 1 hour.p  pAs I understand from the SDK, I do not have a way to INITIATE something in the background unless I run Location Services forever. When this service runs, it gives me an event from time to time, and Im able to run my code during these calls. I tried it, and even with the minimal precision possible, my battery goes down very quickly.p  pSo, Im looking for a way to  run Location Services for few seconds every hour.

Negative 491 pI am designing a web application at the moment, and one of the requirements is to secure the user credentials as well as their roles. Now ofc besides the usual pwd hashing  salt .... I was thinking of putting those specific tables in an encrypted H2 database, and the rest of the data ina MySQL db. the advantages of H2 in my case are inmemory storage, so means faster access encrypted db so an additional layer of security in case the server gets compromised.p  pMy question is this a common practice when an additional security layer is demanded meaning is it a good idea to seperate the login info in my case, it is the sensitive data from the other datap  pThanksp
Negative 491 pIve been trying to learn me a Haskell through the online book a hrefhttplearnyouahaskell.comfunctorsapplicativefunctorsandmonoidsapplicativefunctorsLYAHa. p  pThe author describes the behaviour of Functors of the Applicative type as sort of having the ability to extract a function from one functor and mapping it over a second functor this is through the lt function declared for the Applicative type classp  precodeclass Functor f gt Applicative f where       pure  a gt f a       ltgt  f a gt b gt f a gt f b   codepre  pAs a simple example, the Maybe type is an instance of Applicative under the following implementationp  precode    instance Applicative Maybe where       pure  Just       Nothing ltgt   Nothing       Just f ltgt something  fmap f something   codepre  pAn example of the behaviour mentioned previouslyp  precodeghcigt Just 2 ltgt Just 10          evaluates to Just 20 codepre  pso the lt operator extracts the 2 function from the first operand and maps it over the second operand.p  pNow in Applicative types, both operands of lt are of the same type, so I thought as an exercise why not try implementing a generalisation of this behaviour, where the two operands are Functors of different types, so I could evaluate something like thisp  precodeJust 2 ltgt [1,2,3,4]   should evaluate to [2,4,6,8] codepre  pSo this is what I came up withp  precodeimport Control.Applicative  class Applicative f, Functor g gt DApplicative f g where     pure1  a gt f a     pure1  pure     ltgt  f  a gt b   gt g a gt g b       referred below as 1  instance DApplicative Maybe [] where     an instance pair of this class     Just func ltgt g  fmap func g  main  do putStrLnshow x     where x  Just 2 ltgt [1,2,3,4]   it works, x equals [2,4,6,8] codepre  pNow, although the above works, Im wondering if we can do better is it possible to give a default implementation for  lt that can be applied to a variety of f amp g pairs, in the declaration for DApplicative f g itself And this leads me to the following question Is there a way to pattern match on constructors across different data types p  pI hope my questions make some sense and Im not just spewing nonsense if I am, please dont be too harsh Im just an FP beginner up way past his bedtime...p

Negative 491 pWe have a web application written with JSF and are trying to add a mobile version to it. Ideally, wed have a separate folder with templates, CRUD and resources e.g. jQuery Mobile and our landing page would be able to choose the appropriate template based on the useragent attribute of the header.p  pOne way would be to use a scriptlet and redirect to mobileindex.xhtml  end of story, but people dont like scriptlets Dp  pAnother way would be to wrap the content of the landing page includind the templated parts in a panelGroup with renderedmobileDetector.isMobile, having a backing bean perform what the scriptlet would have done otherwise.

However, I found that it still gets instantiated later than some other bindings of nonservlet classes, which were of the formp  precodebindMyInterface.class.toMyClass.class.asEagerSingleton codepre  peven though those other bindings appeared later in the modulesbindings order. Ive looked into it, and found that Guice simply instantiates eager singletons which were bound by the form of bind... to... asEagerSingleton before it does ones of bind... asEagerSingleton, and so I solved it by modifying the line     bindMyServlet.class.asEagerSingleton into     bindMyServletDummyInterface.class.toMyServlet.class.asEagerSingletonp  pand that actually worked. Still, Id rather avoid having a dummy interface just to solve this, so I was wondering if anyone had a better solution for this..p  p3 I have two Guice modules  one ServletModule and one AbstractModule. The ServletModule configureServlets has the following binding in itp  precodeserveaUrl.withSomeServlet.class codepre  pThe AbstractModules configure has the following bindingsp  precodebindSomeImpl.class.asEagerSingleton bindSomeInterface.class.toSomeImpl.class.inSingleton.class codepre  pAdditionally, The SomeServlet class has an injected field of type SomeInterface, and has a Singleton annotation on top of the class.p  pNow, one would expect that upon creating an injector, the SomeImpl class will get instantiated, and the same instance will be injected into the SomeServlet instance. As mentioned before, servlets bounded with a serve... with... statement also seem to get eagerly instantiated, but either way there should still be only one SomeImpl object instantiated. Yet for some reason, I got two SomeImpl objects instantiated when doing this. To get around it, I mixed the two lines in configure a bit, and instead of the above I had there the following linesp  precodebindSomeImpl.class.inSingleton.class bindSomeInterface.class.toSomeImpl.class.asEagerSingleton codepre  pand then it worked fine, and I got only one instance of SomeImpl instantiated. I dont really get why the switch should matter  I can see how the latter way is better, but Id expect both to work correctly, so Im just wondering if Im getting something wrong here..p  pbrbr Sorry about the length,br Thanks for the helpp
Negative 491 pBy default Xtext allows to specify a single extension for DSL files when creating a new project.

Negative 491 pNowadays, I have started working on 3 tier architecture but i have some doubts in my mind.p  pGenerally we bind data control to a objectdatasource and call business objects function to perform select, insert, update or delete operation. I dont have any problem with this way.p  pBut, My problem is that  i have a login part that simply contains 2 textbox and 1 button and i created a business object whose property represent username and password then i called business objects function and that function in turn called data access layers function to return a datarow containing userid from database if username and password are right....p  pso i think that it is not the correct way of working with 3 tier when you are not working with data controls...because here we are unreasonably calling function and function while we can access data even in code behind ...so please tell me that whether i am working correctly or not ... or is there any better way of performing similar operation.p

Negative 491 pAre there any good tools for getting statistics about applications released to testers So far I have found the a hrefhttpwww.hockeyapp.net relnofollowhttpwww.hockeyapp.neta  I went through tutorials and it seems to be nothing more then the crash log collector and new versions notifier. I would like to collect also debug logs, have possibility to configure application, see number of testers, time they spend by testing, get information about devices they used, possibly see the network traces of my application.p  pI understand it of course will need more integration of the service SDK with our code, but this we can accept.p  pRegards, STeNp

Negative 491 pI have a data structure of key value pairs and I want to implement GROUP BY value. Both keys and values are strings.p  pSo what I did was I gave every valuestring a unique prime number. Then for every key I stored the multiplication of all the prime numbers associated with different values that a particular key has. So if key Anirudh has values x,y,z, then I store the number MKey   235  30 as well. Later if I want to do group by a particular value xsay then I just iterate over all the keys, and divide the Mkey by the prime number associated with x. I then check if the remainder is 0 and if it is zero, then that particular key is a part of group by for value x.p  pI know that this is the most weird way to do it. Some people sort the key value pairssorted by values. I could have also created another tablehash table already grouped by values. So I want to know a better method than mine there must be many. In my method as the number of unique values for a particular key increases the product of prime number also increases that too exponentially. p

Negative 491 pIve recently asked a number of questions regarding codeTVarcode, and I still have concerns about livelock.p  pSo I thought of this structurep  ol liEach transaction gets a unique priority perhaps allocated in order of creation.  li liTransactions attempt to get readwrite locks on data they access. Naturally, simultaneous reads are okay, but one write lock excludes all others both read and write.   li liSay transaction A has higher priority than transaction B. If A holds the lock, B waits, but if B holds the lock and A wants it, B is booted from the lock, A obtains it, and transaction B restarts like with codeTVarcode. B however keeps its current priority for the retry.  li liWhen a lock is freed and there are transactions waiting, it goes to the highest priority transaction, and the rest continue to wait.li ol  pThis system I believe prevents deadlocks, but also prevents starvation unlike codeTVarcode. I was wondering if anyone has implemented such a system, as it seems fairly obvious and I dont want to reinvent the wheel.p  pOf course, such an approach could easily be extended to allow the user to specify priorities.p  pPriority could be the pair codeusersuppliedprio, autoincrementcode, with codeusersuppliedpriocode taking precedence, but equal priority tasks resolving in FIFO order.p  pstrongCommentSolutionstrongp  pActually, when I think about it, what I describe already exists in Haskell, simply by using one codeIORefcode wrapped around all the data, and only using codeatomicModifyIORefcode. The codeatomicModifyIORefcode will ensure transactions are applied in sequence. However, one may think that this means that the data structure is sequential i.e. effectively limited to one thread but it is actually parallel due to laziness.p  pTo explain this, consider an expensive function codefcode. We are going to apply this to a codeData.Mapcode to the data with the key foo.p  pThis replaces codefoo gt xcode with codefoo gt futuref xcode. This thread shall continue to work out what codef xcode actually is, but in the meantime we can apply g to bar. Since applying g to bar does not need the result of foo, we can work this out at the same time.p  pNo deadlocks, no starvation, eventually all transactions will be processed roughly in the order they are received.p

I remember seeing a NumericField and there is this NumericComparator.p  pBasically, I am trying a noSQL orm solution that offers indexingon github though the client decides how many indexes per table and the partitioning methodology but you add entites to the index and remove them yourself and can use namedQueries though you have to get the index by name first before the query since one table may have millions of indexes.

Negative 491 pI set up a little machine running Ubuntu Server 12.04 with an Epson TMT88V plugged into it directly. At first I was able to print fine using lp but the autocutter wasnt working. I realized it just wasnt using the correct PPD file that was included with the driver, so once I set the printer to use that cutting started working fine.p  pHowever, once I got it using the right PPD file the text is printing so light its almost hard to read. When I tried to pass ESCPOS commands directly to it it was essentially like Id gone back to the original situation dark text, no cut.p  pThis is really my first foray into thermal printers, so my apologies if Im missing something simple. Am I going about this the completely wrong way Any advice would be greatly appreciated.p  pI originally posted this on SuperUser, but I suppose since the printer is physically working correctly this is obviously a mistake Im making on the programming side.p  pThis is the command Im using to print its Node.js.

How can I efficiently take a state and find out another similar state is present in the list by lookupp  pI can compare the codesomearraycode array of every state element in the list with the given state object. But this will take so many computation ONsize of somearray. How can I do this with minimal computationp  pNote All except one array entitlements will be almost same in each case. So, the look up can go to very deep in the array.p

Negative 491 pstrongEDITstrong  Ive uploaded a video to youtube demonstrating the bug here a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvzkDYlgtX5Hkhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvzkDYlgtX5Hkap  pIve got a really weird bug that I found testing my new web application on a Samsung Galaxy S2 running Android 4.03 ICS.p  pWhat happens is that when you load a form in the default web browser, and then scroll down the page, the hitboxtouchable area seems to stay where it was on screen when the page first loaded, even though the form element itself has scrolled up the screen.  p  pAs far as I can tell with the few testing devices I have available, I think this only happens on the Samsung Galaxy S2 as I have tried it in the Android simulator with the same version of android and was unable to replicate the problem.  I know this makes it a very specific user base that haves the probem however last I checked the Galaxy s2 was the most popular Android handset in my country Australia  so it would be nice to find a fix.p  pI have created a very simple page to demonstrate this at a hrefhttpusers.tpg.com.augeofficatest.htmlhttpusers.tpg.com.augeofficatest.htmlap  pYou can replicate the problem by doing the following p  ol liLoad the page on a Galaxy S2li liScroll the browser so that page completely fills the screen and the address bar is emjustem off the top of the screen.li liWhere the select box is, place your finger to the side of the screen as a marker of where the select list was.li liScroll down the page any distance, while still keeping the select list on screen then touch the whitespace where the select list used to be and the options should come up on screen.  It may take a few attempts to get it but it will happen.li ol  pNow I know you are thinking this is quite tricky to replicate and likely rare that it will happen, but on a form I built for a client because of where the elements were positioned, the hitbox always overlapped the submit button of the form, making it very difficult to hit the submit button. Select lists will also steal touches from other select lists if the hitboxes overlap, making the wrong options appear when touched.p  pIve tried many things but the only workaround Ive found so far is to use the touchstart event to trigger my submit button instead of the click event.  This seems to happen before the click event of the select lists and prevents it from getting in first, but this is far from ideal, and doesnt stop the select lists from stealing clicks from other elements on the page.p  pIve also thought about rolling my own jquery plugin to maybe place the select lists offscreen and then trigger their click events by touching a link or something.  If its a mobile device then the options will come up on screen regardless of the position of the select ilst. This would be quite cumbersome however and I would need to factor in the effect this would have on users coming from a pc or ipad for example which shows the options in a dropdown list instead.  Sounds pretty prolematic to me.  May even require some Galaxy s2 specific browserdevice sniffing.p  pDoes anyone have a real workaround for this, apart from just not using select listsp

Negative 491 pIve read a ton about persistent database connections between PHP and MySQL mysqlconnect vs. mysqlpconnect. Same with PDO and MySQLi.  Its definitely just my lack of understanding on this one, but how can a database connection be persistent between webpages  In this codep  precodeconn  mysqlpconnect server , user, pass  mysqlselectdb dbname  codepre  pIf two users load this page at the same time, with two different dbname variables, will PHP only make one connection to the database or two  I am fairly certain thatp  precodeconn  mysqlconnect server , user, pass  codepre  pwould make two connections.p  pIf pconnect reuses the connection opened by the first user, will the mysqlselectdb call work for the second userp  pIdeally, what I am looking for is a way to have fewer database connections but still be able to set the default database in each PHP script.  I have clients who all use the same PHP scripts, but the data is stored in their own client database hence, dbname is always different, but the MySQL connection parameters are the same  same mysql ip address, user and password.p  pHope that makes sense.  We can use MySQL, MySQLi or PDO, just need to know how to accomplish this the best way without having the possibility for clients to accidently write data to someone elses database Thanks in advance.p

Negative 491 pCan anybody spot what is wrong with the code below. It is supposed to average the frame interval dt for the previous TIMESTEPS number of frames.p  pIm using Box2d and cocos2d, although I dont think the cocos2d bit is very relevent.p  precodevoid update ccTime dt      float32 timeStep     const int32 velocityIterations  8     const int32 positionIterations  3       Average the previous TIMESTEPS time steps      for int i  0 i lt TIMESTEPS i              timeStep  previoustimesteps[i]           timeStep  timeStepTIMESTEPS       step the world     [GB2Engine sharedInstance].worldgtSteptimeStep, velocityIterations, positionIterations      for int i  0 i lt TIMESTEPS  1 i              previoustimesteps[i]  previoustimesteps[i1]           previoustimesteps[TIMESTEPS  1]  dt  codepre  pThe previoustimesteps array is initially filled with whatever the animation interval is set too.p  pThis doesnt do what I would expect it too. On devices with a low frame rate it speeds up the simulation and on devices with a high frame rate it slows it down. Im sure its something stupid Im over looking.p  pI know box2D likes to work with fixed times steps but I really dont have a choice. My game runs at a very variable frame rate on the various devices so a fixed time stop just wont work. The game runs at an average of 40 fps, but on some of the crappier devices like the first gen iPad it runs at barely 30 frames per second. The third gen ipad runs it at 5060 frames per second.p  pIm open to suggestion on other ways of dealing with this problem too. Any advice would be appreciated.p  pSomething else unusual I should note that somebody might have some insight into is the fact that running any debug optimisations on the build has a huge effect on the above. The frame rate isnt changed much when debug optimisations are set to Os vs O0. But when the debut optimisations are set to Os the physics simulation runs much faster than O0 when the above code is active. If I just use dt as the interval instead of the above code then the debug optimisations make no difference.p  pIm totally confused by that.p

Negative 491 pSuppose I have a running Scala application with actors. I suspect one actor does not work, i.e. either it exited or it is stuck or it is running in a loop.p  pNow I would like to know what is exactly going on with the actor. Is there any way in Scala to check actorstheir mailboxes from the outside of the application, e.g. with codeJMXcode p  pI guess if an actor exited because of an uncaught codeThrowablecode the Scala actor library always writes this in the log. Is it correct I can check also if an actor is stuck using a JVM thread dump.p  pWhat else can I use to check if my actor is runningp

The gennotifiercs project is the C plugin wrapper created by Sharpamp. notifiercs is where all my code resides. The two other projects are self explanatory I assume. strongI have referenced the PubNub API in notifiercs, and also have referenced Sharpamp in both notifiercs and PubNub API.strongp  pSo, the objects that need to get serialized are of a class codeSongcode as defined in Sharpampp  precode    public class Song      public string Title  get internal set      public string Artist  get internal set      public string Album  get internal set      public string Year  get internal set      public bool HasMetadata  get internal set      public string Filename  get internal set   codepre  pSo lets say if I have a codesongcode object with song data in it, I would go codepubnub.publishwinamppipe, songcode to publish it and PubNub will automatically serialize the data into JSON.

Negative 491 pI am still new to ST so I am probably doing several things wrong here but I cant figure out where the problems are. p  pstrongProblem 1strong when I use the pull to refresh plugin, I get double the data instead of it just refreshing the data. I have seen to use a propertyId and so I did to no avail. This should be simple so probably something silly Im doing wrong.p  pstrongProblem 2strong I am trying to figure out the most efficient way to use the MVC architecture and I have read through the documentation and many examples. So, I dont know if I am just not understanding clearly or need a better example. I am trying to create a simple app for now with a list that I can tap on an item and get a detailed view of that item. I will later evolve it into a more robust monster but for now I am trying to understand the basics. I finally got my close button to close the detail view when I click a list item but then I can no longer get a detail view when tapping another item. I have read that this is due to autoDestroy off not being present but I tried that, also with no luck. I want to be able to create certain buttons like close that I can put in multiple views and just have to have the logic in the controllers.p  pstrongMain Viewstrongp

Negative 491 pI have a problematic piece of code that uses Wordnik API to fetch word definitions. This code works fine in local trusted security sandbox, but doesnt work online  it produces a security sandbox violation but no common ways of solving sandbox violation helped.p  pIve consulted this with Wordnik API creators and they didnt solve my problem directly but pointed me to a working example. Indeed their example works, but it uses Flex class Application.p  pSame code that doesnt work in a standalone .as class, does work when used in Flex Application.p  pMy question is what are the differences especially security differences between Flex Application class and normal AS3 class extending Spritep  pIm using Flashdevelop to compile. That can be important as Wordnik guys said that it worked fine in Flash Builder  although they didnt provide the details and I couldnt reproduce it.p  pI can attach the code if it is needed.p

Negative 491 pI have the following set upp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjosephbulgerFjmAU relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjosephbulgerFjmAUap  pI have a KOJS view model which has a parent and child relationship. What makes this relationship a little weird, is that the child needs the parent in order to perform one of its computed functions.p  pThis causes all sorts of issues for me, because when I call a save, and I have to reload all my children, the old children are still having their computed functions being fired whenever the parents observable is changed.p  pThis is not the behavior Im going for. What I would like to do, is remove all the children completely before I save, and then add the children back from the server callback. What I mean by this, is that the old children would be completely gone from memory, that they would not fire any of their events any more. However, I dont know how to actually clean them up properly with KOJS. The only thing I know how to do properly at this point is to remove them from the parents child list.p  pWhat is the proper way to dispose of child objects in a KOJS view model completelyp

Although the scrollbar does appear, the bottom extent of it goes beyond the footer and indeed off the edge of the page.p  pIf I decrease the overall page height e.g. by adjusting the horizontal splitter in jsFiddle I can see that the size of the central editor div does decrease the scrollbar grows accordingly. However, its overall resulting height is too big.p  pIncreasing the width of the nav div to the left using the resizehandle also causes the scrollbar of the central editor div to grow accordingly, which is great. Aside from the fact that, again, its overall resulting height is too big.p  pThe contents of the details and toolbar divs should wrap. E.g, if you increase the width of the nav div enough using the resizehandle, youll see the Button1  Button2  etc contents start to wrap and the editor div is displaced down accordingly. The height of the editor div needs to take account of this too.p  pLastly, if I increase the height of the detail div again using the resizehandle I find it has no affect on the central editor div height at all it just gets pushed down beyond the edge of the page and the scrollbar height doesnt change.p  pI think this is happening because the codeheight 100code Ive set on the editor div is using the height of something in its ancestor elements which is not correct, perhaps the body element. But I dont know what to do about it.p  pIdeally Id use a pure CSS solution because if I were to resort to JavaScript Id probably have to handle a number of different events, such as resizing the navigation and detail divs, resizing the screen, page load etc. But I would be open to a JavaScript solution if it were simple.p  pIndeed, simplicity is really what I am after here more than anything.p  pIve seen different solutions to various aspects of this in isolation but nothing which brings them all together.p

Let me explainp  ul liEach line of the inspector property view is implemented by a InspectorPropertyCell which uses only Autolayout.li liThere is a StackPanel custom control which stacks the cells and uses autolayout too. For each group there is a stack panel associated. The Group 04 is inside Group 03. Both are collapsible.li liThere is an outer stack panel that stacks all the groups. This outer stack panel sets the height explicitly by using the frame property.li liThis is all contained inside a NSScrollView.li ul  pSee an imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDB7l4.png altenter image description herep  pEverything works fine but if I resize the window to have its content area smaller that the whole property inspector view so I can scroll the property inspector view, then scroll to the bottom and then collapse the last group Group 04, the property inspector view shrinks and acts correctly. Also, the scroll viewable regions is adjusted accordingly. The problem is that I cant undo the collapsing of group 04. p  pBy setting a few breakpoints in the code, I discovered what the problem is. I just dont know how to solve it. The problem is that while the updateConstraints pass is called because I call setNeedsUpdateConstraints, the layout pass is not called. Even if i force a layout pass by calling layoutSubtreeIfNeeded, the auto layout doesnt seem to be having a effect because the height of some cells that I set to 0 using a constraint, when I do the collapsing, is still 0 when I uncollapse.p  pThe layout pass gets called again If I resize the window. Of course, this is unacceptable.p  pPlease, Help I am about to drop Auto Layout entirely and do custom layout using only Layout...p

Negative 491 pI have been researching and looking for answers here to a problem that I suspect might be solved by a better understanding of design patterns. I think the problem is that I am a selftaught coder and people seem to tend to assume familiarity with a lot of esoteric terminology I have ended up in Wikipedia spirals trying to determine what some phrases mean. That said  on to the codingstructural problem.p  pActually, just before I start, I should point out that I may well be making unknown presumptions in the way the code is structured in my question. If this is the case, could folks suggest alternatives to what Im suggesting Id really appreciate learning how to better code as opposed to simply being told Im doing it wrong. OK...p  pLets say we have a Room class, which has 4 Walls, a Ceiling and a Floor. These are instantiated inside the Room. The Room also has a Table which has 4 TableLegs, again instantiated inside the Table, inside the Room. This, I believe, is Composition, but please correct me if Ive got that wrong.p  pFinally, the problem If someone, somehow, pushes the Table, the TableLegs will need to check the type of Floor theyre standing on to trigger the appropriate sound. This, currently would be my solutionp  pThe Table dispatches an event. The Room listens for that table pushed event, quizes the Floor to determine its type, then passes that type to a method on Table, which in turn passes it to the TableLegs. This, to me, seems fairly inelegant hence my suspicion that knowledge of design patterns might be useful. Is there something fundamentally wrong about the structure Ive described that Im not appreciating If so, what is the alternativep  pFinally, I have heard of the Gang of Four book. If thats my first port of call, is it written in an accessible style or will I have to have studied computer science to grasp it Sorry for the long, designpatternbeginners question.p

As if it werent simple enough, what Im tryin to do is thisp  pThe custom property is actually an INT. I know I declared the dependency right since VS let me compile. Each Pad has this custom property storing an int, and I need to retrieve it to access an array element. The function triggered is thisp  precodeprivate void makeasoundobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e              int x  this.Son         var sons  new[]  sonsfirstsound.wav, sonssecondsound.wav, sonsthirdsound.wav          string target  sons[x]         StreamResourceInfo info  Application.GetResourceStream         new Uritarget, UriKind.Relative         alarm  SoundEffect.FromStreaminfo.Stream         Microsoft.Xna.Framework.FrameworkDispatcher.Update         alarm.Play           codepre  pSo, I declare an array storing URIs for sounds that Id like to playson means sound in french, Im from Belgium. I then use the INT associated with the triggering element to access the URI of a sound, then I play this sound.p  pThe reason I do this is because Id like to let the user change the INT value for each pad and therefore choose what sound each pad plays. The fact that I seem to have no choice but to declare this array each time the function is called otherwise its not in context is not very elegant but I guess I can live with that  array will have 5060 elements in itp  pSo, for those who read this far, my problem is to use a property of the triggering event, which seems to be harder when its a custom property. I put the rest of the logic in case someone had advices.p  pI thank anyone who read this message and who could maybe help me sorting this out.

Negative 491 pI have read that data structures are heavily used in text editors.

Basically, I have a simple text editor with no data structures.p  pIm guessing the data structure for the editing is implemented in the codeJTextAreacode itself. Is this correct Or does the data structure go even lower that is, where the OS accepts the data from the keyboard into the buffer So can some one help me understand that at what level of abstraction the data structure is implementedp

Negative 491 pWhen uploading a photo with the Facebook REST API, I occasionally get a 503Failed to write to server  from Facebook. p  pI see in a capture of the TCP traffic that while I am sending the image with SSL, the Facebook server will suddenly send an Encrypted Alert code21 and shortly after send a bunch of RST flags. This always happens in the middle of the transfer.p  pI have tested with various different images and it seems like the bigger the image, the more likely it is to fail. For example, a 3kb image will have a 100 success rate. A 400kb image will have 50 success rate. A 600kb will have 25 success rate and a 800kb or bigger image seems to fail all the time.p  pI should also add that there are times when even a much larger image 2000kb will upload successfully many times in a row but once one failure happens, the results I mentioned above start to happen.p  pSo my question is, what can be causing this behavior Why would the upload fail on one attempt and succeed on subsequent attempts with the same imagep

Negative 491 pWhile coding a seemingly simple part of a Qt application that would run a subprocess and read data from its standard output, I have stumbled upon a problem that has me really puzzled. The application should read blocks of data raw video frames from the subprocess and process them as they arrivep  ol listart a QProcessli ligather data until there is enough for one frameli liprocess the frameli lireturn to step 2li ol  pThe idea was to implement the processing loop using signals and slots  this might look silly in the simple, strippeddown example that I provide below, but seemed entirely reasonable within the framework of the original application. So here we gop  precodeappapp    process.startcat devzero   buffer  new char[frameLength]   connectthis, SIGNALwantNewFrame, SLOTreadFrame, QtQueuedConnection   connectthis, SIGNALframeReady, SLOTframeHandler, QtQueuedConnection   emit wantNewFrame  codepre  pI start here a trivial process codecat devzerocode so that we can be confident that it will not run out of data. I also make two connections one starts the reading when a frame is needed and the other calls a data handling function upon the arrival of a frame. Note that this trivial example runs in a single thread so the connections are made to be of the queued type to avoid infinite recursion. The codewantNewFramecode signal initiates the acquisition of the first frame it gets handled when the control returns to the event loop.p  precodebool appreadFrame    qint64 bytesNeeded  frameLength   qint64 bytesRead  0   char ptr  buffer   while bytesNeeded gt 0      process.waitForReadyRead     bytesRead  process.readptr, bytesNeeded     if bytesRead  1        qDebug ltlt process state ltlt process.state       qDebug ltlt process error ltlt process.error       qDebug ltlt QIODevice error ltlt process.errorString       QCoreApplicationquit       break          ptr  bytesRead     bytesNeeded  bytesRead      if bytesNeeded  0      emit frameReady     return true    else     return false  codepre  pReading the frame basically, I just stuff the data into a buffer as it arrives. The codeframeReadycode signal at the end announces that the frame is ready and in turn causes the data handling function to run.p  precodevoid appframeHandler    static qint64 frameno  0   qDebug ltlt frame ltlt frameno   emit wantNewFrame  codepre  pA trivial data processor it just counts the frames.

Negative 491 pThe project Im working on has a lot of boilerplate code for passing Repository objects around. The parent object creates a repository, passes it to any utility  helper methods to do some specific work, then in the end the parent object calls commit or save on the repository. And many times these utilityhelper methods calls other methods, which also requires the repository. For one, we are definitely using the Repository Pattern incorrectly, since many of these helper methods really just uses the repositories as a DAO or even just a DB connection, run a quick query and be done with it. My question is what is the best way to avoid having to pass these repositories around p  pThe most primitive way would be to create the repositories in these helper methods, then destroy them using clauses, and there are obvious downsides to that, and its against DRY. p  pI also see examples of people registering these repositories as services, and use them that way. p  pPlease take thread safety into consideration.p  pWhat are the expert opinions on this Any example would be much appreciated. p  pPS.

If I stop the Anthill Agent service and launch the agent manually so that the agent is running in the foreground, I also dont have an issue with the application displaying on the screen. p  pSo I believe this is an Anthill Pro configuration issue, but Im not familiar enough to know what the issue could be or where to look.p

Negative 491 pI think we just take it for granted that whenever we change the DOM elements property or its CSSStyleDeclation objects property, the page will be redrawnp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpeqtL relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpeqtLap  precodedocument.getElementByIdfoo.innerHTML  bar document.getElementByIdfoo.style.padding  30px codepre  pbut to think about it, code.stylecode returns a codeCSSStyleDeclarationcode object, and codepaddingcode returns a property.  Now we simply set a property, and how does that trigger and cause the page to look differentp  pI am thinking, would this be the classic a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiObserverpattern relnofollowObserver Patterna, where the page renderer register with every DOM element and codeCSSStyleDeclarationcode object that, whenever the property changes, notify the renderer to redraw part of the pagep  pOr, isnt it true that, even if we change something, the whole page can be affected for example, the codezindexcode will affect itself and all the siblings cover up order, so we need to redraw the parent node and down the tree, or what if the element has codeposition relativecode or codeposition absolutecode, it can affect any element on the page at all, so the whole page needs to be redrawn.  So in other words, the renderer may not need to register with every DOM elements and its codeCSSStyleDeclarationcode object.  The render just need to register with the top level DOM object either codedocumentcode or the codelthtmlgtcode tag element, which is codedocument.documentElementcode and a simple implementation is, any change to its property or its offsprings property, then notify the renderer to redraw the whole page.  Whenever we simply get the value of the property, the renderer doesnt need to be notified to redraw the page.p  pAnd this observer pattern is internal to the DOM and JavaScript engine  that is, we cant really touch or know how it is done underneathp  pI know the implementation is supposed to be hidden and unknown to the user of HTML and JavaScript, but it is from a programming standpoint that I hope to know what is a practical way that this can be implemented, as a part of a software system.p

Negative 491 pso Im working on some practice problems for my programming languages class, and one of the assignments is to create a script MyEval which allows you to do simple nested addition and multiplication.  So for example the program would be able to do this codeMyEval 1 3 4code or deeper, but without having to do subtraction or more than 2 numbers and an operator. So not so complicated. However my mind is fried and I would love some guidance. This is what I have so farp  precodelang racket define ns makebasenamespace define MyEval lis   cond     [and  neither is a list and can be evaluated      notlist car lis      notlist caddr lis             eval cons cadr lis list car lis caddr lis  ns]      [list car lis      MyEval car lis]      [list caddr lis      MyEval caddr lis]            end of cond   end of define codepre  pbut as you guys might notice this would only solve the last inner parentheses , so if I do codeMyEval 1  1  2code I get 3, not 4. Any guidance or tip is appreciated, I dont know how accurate my title is, but if it isnt appropriate please let me know.p  pThank you p

Negative 491 pAs the time needed for run complete PHPUnit suite raises, our team starts wondering if there is a possibility to strongrun Unit tests in parallelstrong. Recently I read an article about Paraunit, also Sebastian Bergman wrote, hell add parallelism into PHPUnit 3.7.p  pBut there remains the strongproblem with integration testsstrong, or, more generally, tests that interact with DB. For the sake of consistency, the testDB has to be resetted and fixtures  loaded after each test. But in parallel tests there is a problem with race conditions, because strongall processes use the same DBstrong.p  pSo to be able to run integration tests in parallel, strongwe have to assign own database to each processstrong. I would like to ask, if someone has some thoughts about how this problem can be solved. Maybe there are already implemented solutions to this problem in another xUnit implementation.p  pIn my team we are using MongoDB, so one solution would be to programmatically create a config file for each PHPUnit process, with generated DB namefor this process, and in codesetUpcode method we could clone the main TestDb into this temporary one. But before we start to implement this approach I would like to ask for your ideas about the topic.p

Negative 491 pMy question is, is there any way to reliably hold a key down on a mac with applescriptpythonp  pI have search almost everywhere for topics like this, however, none of them cut it. I am attempting to use Python to read serial information from an Arduino, then relay those signals as keypresses. I have seen how to use applescript to send a key down to the system event, as shown in the following codep  precodePython code     def SendDownkey     string  strkey     cmd  osascript e tell application System Events to key down key code   string         os.systemcmd codepre  pThis code works generally, however, I want to control the Google flight simulator. When I attempt to do this, the key presses seem to be way to quick and the flight simulator or the basic google earth map moves fractions of what I would expect.p  pThey way I am using this code is essentially as follows suedocodep  precodeif ArduinoMessage  left     SendDownleftKey leftKey has been set to 123  the code for the left arrow key     etc... codepre  pFrom my point of view, the key down event Im sending is essentially a quick keystroke and the key is not being held down. I tried programming the key event directly in applescript and had a little bit of success. My code looked something like thisp  precodetell application System Events     repeat 50 times             key down key code 123     end repeat     key up key code 123 end tell codepre  pThat code moved the google earth map more than I have been getting, but it took a long time to get it to move a small amount far less than the normal arrow keys. Then I tried to write that applescript into Python and lost all improvement.p  pSo I restate the question  is there any way to reliably hold a key down on a mac with applescriptpythonp  pI was able to get this to work on Windows fairly easily, however, I was able to use a Windows only library called SendKeys that is designed for applications such as this.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pJakep

Negative 491 pThis is my second question today actually but what I want to know...Is it possible to retrieve information from a signal handler.p  pI have a list of items, call it list and each item is in AppA.

Negative 491 pI have a potential client hes a friend of mine requesting the following His company has contractors collecting data of buildings condition, tenants etc.. They want to optimize this process with a web app  native app on a tablet the contractors have with them to input the data they are doing it on paper now and store it in a database. They must also take a picture of the building and attach it to the data set. p  pIm capable of creating a web application for the data entries, but Im wondering what would be the best way to upload the images. You have to consider that at some points, the user will have slow connection or none at all. A server side solution like rails seems not to be the best way, since users will have to wait until the picture uploads before they can continue to work with the app. On the other hand, I would like to avoid creating a native application with a sync button to upload all new data when pressed. Especially because I generally think a browser based tool is always the more flexible and sustainable solution.p  pNow I played a bit with meteor, and to my understanding Im pretty new to web development, meteor will save everything on the client first and will sync it with the server when accessible. Would that be a good solution for the specs described above Or would you prefer a containerapp like phonegapp  pI dont want any detailed instructions but just a general opinion on what would be the best way to approach this issue.p  pThanks in advancep

I can run something like  slugifyString text  and get an output that looks like stringtext which is what I want.p  pWhen I try to add things to the DB instead of a slug I get  or something similar and not an actual slug. I have tried various things like making the title use Text instead of Unicode, or UnicodeText. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pOn a side note, I can get it to work ok with Python 2 the way its set up... but then the query byslug works but only if I first query byid. So both the termid and the slug have to be in the URL to work properly. Not sure if thats related...likely a second questionp

Negative 491 precodeincludeltstdio.hgt  main  char c cgetchar putcharc  cgetchar putcharc  cgetchar  putcharc  cgetchar putcharc  cgetchar putcharc   codepre  pMy 1st question is that whenever we use stronggetcharstrong its create a buffer somewhere in memory and when we press enter stronggetcharstrong starts reading content from buffer and stronggetcharstrong read only one character at time. So in this above program when 1st stronggetcharstrong will execute it creates a buffer in memory and whole line content will store in the buffer suppose I write vik when I hit enter stronggetcharstrong starts reading content from buffer and then v will assign to variable c and then only v will flush from the buffer because stronggetcharstrong reads only single character at a time. Then in next statement strongputcharcstrong prints v on screen. So now ik are left in buffer when 2nd stronggetcharstrong statement execute it will not ask again to user to writing something because unless and until buffer will not flush totally its will not ask again to user to write something rather its read content from buffer. so here ik are remain in butter so in 2nd stronggetcharstrong statement read i from the buffer and then again i will flush from buffer and strongputcharcstrong prints i. Now k is left in buffer when 3rd stronggetcharstrong execute it read k from buffer and assing to c then k also flush from buffer.Now at this point buffer is totally flushed,there is no content is in buffer when 4th stronggetcharstrong will execute its ask to user to write something because there is no content is in buffer so lets suppose I write as and hits enter. strongemNow my main question is that when I give two content as and there two getchar and putcharc are left to execute so why only a will print on screen why not s also emstrongp  pAnd, My second question is that, if we say that when we use stronggetcharstrong its create a buffer in memory  so if we use strongfflushstdinstrong its have to flush the buffer. So according to this in above program when I write strongfflushstdinstrong after the 1st strongputcharcstrong instead of flushing buffer its executes and print same output as above program why p

How do I get past this and allow the user to choose AND allow for method calls I know if I werent using templates I could just declare it before the ifstatements, but with templates the compiler demands I tell it what type I want first.

Negative 491 pI have this website, it is my primary domain, however the folder is actually publichtmlannexation.ca. This part is fine, I have an htaccess rule in my publichtml folder to deal with that, so that it shows up as annexation.ca and not annexation.caannexation.ca.p  pBut I also run a forum off of that website. The problem is that the phpbb software has an autodirect after logon, logoff and in a couple of other instances. And when it does so it generates a URL like thisp  pa hrefhttpannexation.caannexation.cacommunity relnofollowhttpannexation.caannexation.cacommunityap  pThis is not only cosmetically disruptive, but it also impacts the comment section at the bottom of each unique page, where I have Disqus running. What I need is to add a rule to the htaccess file in the root folder that will make these redirects be automatically translated into this againp  pa hrefhttpannexation.cacommunity relnofollowhttpannexation.cacommunityap  pThanksp

Is it necessary to have to create every new shape Also, what if I was to implement the Scanner class into the main class Lets say, the user can type in area values and command back information on subclass shapes and then do this with multiple values of area How would I go about doing that, as I have no idea how with having to create objects in the main class. We just started using the Main method our IDE for the class is BlueJ, which doesnt require it. I hope my question isnt too confusing with its wording and I apologize if I formatted this post wrong, as this is my first post. Thank you.p  pPS I forgot to mention to ignore that square is a rectangle. My professor made a mistake and by accidentally instructed us to extend rectangle from square. p  pPS besides in the main class, where you guys suggested adding each different shape to a collection and then iterating over each and printing out attributes, do you guys have any other alternatives How would I do it with the Scanner class Because in the above situation, I have tl create all the objects. Im trying to get as much practice as possible with main class because Im severely lacking in it due to BlueJ. p

Negative 491 pA project I am working with implements three JAVA script timers from a Master Page to track the session time out and to do a heartbeat check. The setTimerout timer redirects the user to a warning page if the time out count reaches 1 and a half minutes before a session time out will occur.

continue to fire while a browser is on the site. As soon as the user closes the browser or navigates away from the site, even though the web application is still running, the only event that files is the ASP.NET SessionEnd event in Global.asax when the session times out. None of the timers will fire which I am assuming is caused by the fact that the Master Page is no longer loaded so the scripts on the Master do not fire.p  pI dont really care about the setTimeout timer, since there is no need to redirect to a timeout page if the browser is not longer active on the site, so that script can stay on the Master page. However, the two setInterval timers are what I am trying to keep running so the app can detect if the user has left the site and then the app can remove the session data and temp directories for that session.p  pMy question is this Does anyone know of a way to run these two scripts from a service or some other way to implement them so they will continue to fire even though the browser is closed or has gone to another sitep  pThanks Davidp  pPS. A little background The four global variables CurrentSessionTimeout, CurrentHeartBeatTimeout, DefaultHeartBeatTimeout, amp DefaultMissedHeartBeats and the two session variables UseSessionTimeout amp UseHeartBeat are set when the app starts from values stored in an SQL database. However, neither of the handlers use session variables, but instead get any values they need directly from global variables or the database since the session could have ended before the handler fires, that is if a page is still loaded, which goes back to the original reason for this post. p

Negative 491 pI started developing a webapp with angularJS and Im not sure that everything is right secured client and server side.  Security is based on a single login page, if credentials are checked ok, my server sends back an unique token with custom timevalidity. All other REST api are accessible through this token. The application client browse to my entrypoint ex a hrefhttpswww.example.comhome.htmlhttpswww.example.comhome.htmla user insert credentials and receive back a unique token. This unique token is stored in the server database with AES or other secure techniques, it is not stored in clear format.p  pFrom now on, my AngluarJS app will use this token to authenticate to all REST Api exposed.p  pIm thinking on temporary store the token in a custom http cookie basically, when the server verifies the credentials, it sends back a new cookie Ex. p  precodeapptoken  AIXOLQRYIlWTXOLQRYI3XOLQXOLQRYIRYIFD0T codepre  pThe cookie has the a hrefhttpswww.owasp.orgindex.phpSecureFlagsecurea and a hrefhttpswww.owasp.orgindex.phpHttpOnlyHTTP Onlya flags set on.

Negative 491 pI have an existing CC application that communicates with other applicationssystems through several interfaces TCP, DB, shared memory. I would like to run the application once with the real environment and record all function calls and their return values or changes to the buffers passed as parameters. I would record only the calls related with external interfaces TCP, DB with a spy. Then I could run the application again but  using fake functions that should return the previous recorded values. This way I could replay an execution, and check if the results match the original execution.p  pOne important feature is to mock the time functions as well sleep, time, GetLocalTime, because for example the calls to the DB may have the current date or time in the selects. It would be even better to be able to replay all the calls faster than the original execution one day of execution could be replayed in a few minutes. For example a call to sleep1000 should return without waiting, but successive calls to GetLocalTime should return 1 second more. This should take into account that other threads should have consistent values for the time for example the library should allow 1 call to sleep1000 for one thread and 10 calls to sleep100 in another thread.p  pIdeally it shouldnt require a lot of changes or refactoring to the application, just redefining the calls to time functions as well as the calls to the libraries of the external interfaces DB, TCP.p  pI would like to know if there exists some library or framework that implements these features or what could be a good starting point.p  pI have implemented several times solutions for similar problems, but for very simple modules, for example mocking a TCP connection to test a protocol implementation, but I feel like reinventing the wheel each time, and these simple solutions wouldnt scale well with more threads or interactions with more interfaces.p

Negative 491 pIve been using Instruments on an ARC project run on a device to make sure Im cleaning up any abandoned memory.  To this end, Ive been using the allocations generations tool and taking snapshots of my heap for the same action 1020 times.  What Im confused about is the growth.  Some of the time the growth is 0, and then the other, some number of bytes never consistent ranging from a few bytes to a several kilobytes seems to be accruing.  But there is usually at least few iterations where the growth is 0.p  pMy question is if my growth is sometimes 0, does that mean that my memory management is correct  Or do  I still have issues that I need to ferret out  I understand that it might take several cycles for the memory to drain, but what about the memory that is still being allocated and remaining even after 10 iterationsp  pThis seems like a more general question about the interpretation of Instruments, so Ive left out any specific code.  Besides, Ive found this happening in various heap snapshot scenarios pull to refresh, push view controller, etc.p  pEdit Ive included a a hrefhttpi.imgur.comI79353O.png relnofollowsnapshot of my Instruments windowa.p

Negative 491 pYes, I know this is NonOOP but is there some direct or indirect way to access a private object from another class And if not that, is there some method similar to codeField.setAccessiblecode or would I emhaveem to declare it as publicp  pBasically what Im trying to do is access any kind of field whether it be private, protected, or public. Either by setting accessible and then setting it nonaccessible immediately after doing what was necessary with it. I do not want to pass the object as codeFieldcode but as its own object if possible as it would be more efficient.p  pThis class I am making needs this crucial method to function as it is supposed to be fully automatic. The objects class should have no relation to this class except to make a new object of it and is only used by the main class of the program really.p

Negative 491 pI need to read a Microsoft Excel 2003 file .xls from a query in SQL Server 2005, and then insert some of that data into some tables. Reading the file and then using its data is not a problem in itself, but I found that, for a column, sometimes I get a NULL value instead of the value thats shown in the Excel file. To be more specific This column is always just one character long, and it can contain any one digit from 09, or the letter K. Its when the column contains K that the query gives me a NULL value. My assumption is that, since the first few rows contain numbers as the values of this column, the query assumes they will always be numbers, and when it finds a letter it just turns it into NULL.p  pI tried changing the format of the cells in the Excel file to text, and using CAST and CONVERT not at the same time on the value to try to make it a varchar, but it does nothing.p

OK. So what i want to do is to send an email with proper HTML hopefully this same tables that appear in the template. Because this information is different for every bill Factura i cant send and email with static information, it has to show the information of each of the bills.p  pSo how can i do this. Take the info from the database and change the value that appears between the tags to show the correct information for each bill.p  pThank you in advance. I would really appreciate the help or any idea that points me in the right direction. Thank you   p

Negative 491 pI need to add a CALayer to a UILabel, but only after the UILabel has changed its frame. The UILabel changes its frame in the codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode method, and if I add the CALayer there, it will create multiple instances of the CALayers since codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode is called multiple times. Ive tried removing all of the CALayers before adding a new one, but sometimes that removes the text as well. Ive just used codeself.eventAttending.layer.sublayers  nilcode to set the sublayers to null.p  pSo, I think the simplest answer to my issue is to simply add the CALayer after the frame has been adjusted in the codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode, which brings me to my question What method is called after codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscodep

Negative 491 pI am in a software developing team and we are starting a discussion about how can we work together to get better software and software more easily to maintain.p  pOne of the problems that we want to resolve is the dependence of some applications to the person who developed it. In some cases, the code was only implemented by one person and the code is very hard to understand and the documentation not exist or is very poor.p  pTo resolve this problem, someone came with the idea of creating a tool for code generation. This way, all the code will be standardized and will be understand by all the team members.p  pThe main problem is that the generation of the code include the automation for creating interfaces and the majority of the team members sees this as a very good idea. The automation of creation of the interfaces for the final user requires the definition of the ideal interface for the basic uses cases for some group of data, like create, read,  update, delete and listing CRUDL. The idea is to create and automatic process that will generate interfaces for a specific predefined classes of business objects. The only member that opposed to this idea was me. I think this process will resolve the problem of disparity in the code developed but will bring a bigger problem, lower software quality. They argument that the code generated could always being change, but the existence of a tool to generate automatic interfaces will not always detract the user centre design principals This will not lead to an application that only serve to manage data instead of an application that support the uses casesp  pNow I have the task to create a document to convince the team not use this type of approach for creating interfaces. What are the best arguments to persuade the team to use another process for creating applications more user friendlyp
Negative 491 pYes, I actually need to dynamically create variables, and not just use an array, list or dictionary.p  pI am developing a video game using Unity. I have projectiles being fired from a cannon. At first I was having the projectiles dynamically created good so I know it can be done using Unitys Object.Instantiate method. This would cause my game to chunk out while the projectile was loaded into memory.p  pMy solution was to create an Object Cache  Object Pool. The Object Cache uses Unitys Object.Instantiate method to place cacheAmount of game objects into a dictionary before we start playing.p  pThis worked wonders for performance when cacheAmount was less than 64. If cacheAmount was increased above 64 the ObjectCache performed worse than using Unitys Object.Instantiate method.p  pI took a guess and figured that the dictionarys memory space was too large and that the time it took to access the whole block was what was slowing down the game.p  pI decided to split the dictionary up into 8 volumes with 8 objects each, volumes 18 with a total of 64 objects. Having these smaller volumes increased my performance again.p  pI fiddle around for a bit and hard coded 32 volumes with 8 objects. This allowed for 256 projectiles to be fired without a performance impact.p  pOptimally, I would not use a dictionary at all, simply create cacheAmount of variables, and loop through them all. This way I could change cacheAmount,  and cache 256 or more individual objects without having to hard code them 256 times beforehand.p  pso for simplicity sake a I need something like thisp  precodeint cacheAmount  256     for int i  0 i lt cacheAmount i              GameObject dynamicVariablegtilt  GameObjectInstantiateprojectile      codepre  pThen I would have to access dynamicVariable1, dynamicVariable2, dynamicVariable3, dynamicVariable4 etc.p  pHow do I go about this in C or JavaScriptUnityScriptp  ponce again using an array, list, or dictionary, yields a memory space too large and impacts performancep

Negative 491 pIs there a way to check whether a string contains any substring in an arrayp  pSay I have codebadwords  [broccoli, cabbage, kale]code, and codemystring  My shopping list features pizza, gummy bears, kale, and vodka.code I want to check whether codemystringcode has any of the codebadwordscode items within it without using a loopiterator. Is this possiblep  pIt seems like people use codeArrayindexcode to solve this problem, but Im not sure how because, in my tests, it only returns codetruecode if the entire argument matches an entire item from the array codebadwords.index kalecode returns an index but codebadwords.index no kalecode returns codenilcode. So its no good for substrings.p

It was able to retrieve the other attributes that are of integer types, however, without any problems. The same would happen if I tried to set the data in C and C would be able to retrieve it back perfectly but when my C application tried to retrieve the char name, the application would crash. However, in my DLL, I was able to print out the address of the name data being stored, hence eliminating the possibility of it being null.

Negative 491 pI am busy trying to code a ping pong type game into my FPGA Board Altera Cyclone II model and there are two clocks, 50MHz and 27MHz. A clock is required for the game to work. I want to use the 50MHz clock but need to slow it down to 1Hz the ball should only move one LED for every oscillation. I am a very new user to VHDL and FPGA and have done some research online but none have really helped me regarding the slowing down of the clock in VHDL.p  pMy thinking is to use two loops, one for low and one for high and using 25000000 clock cycles for high and 25000000 clock cycles for low which will end up generating a 1Hz clock when using the 50MHz clock. I have no idea how to go about implementing it in VHDL though even though I know the noncode logic for it. p  pI checked a previous similar question a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions23504998clockdividersimulationClock divider simulationa but the person who posted the question did not include comments and I cant really follow what goes on in that code.

Negative 491 pThis is most definitely a very basic question but I am missing something small and not able to find the problem.p  pI have 8 variables coming in as parameters which are put in an array and passed to Datatables Add row function.

Negative 491 pI am working with jqGrid and am having issues with the ui aspect, the sorting icons in particular. It seems that there is some overflow from the span that contains the sorting icons so it cuts the top off.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4cDOR.png altTop sort iconbrThis is an eample of what I mean. As you can see, the grey background is cut off from the top. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEJBVc.png altDesc sortbr The descending Icon comes out fine however. So my question is, is there a way I can remove this grey background from the sort icons I would ideally like to replace the arrows and know how to do that. I am just lost as to removing the grey area. As a side note, there is overlap on the icons too. Is there any way to fix thatp

Negative 491 pI am trying to add a matlab function block to a simulink model available in all matlab installations commcdma2000. Adding a matlab function block slows down the simulation very drastically. I am using the standard malab function block instead of the interpreted MATLAB Function block because it is supposed to be faster. Also all that I do in the matlab function block is to assign the input to the output so there is no complex computation. I would like to add more complex logic within this block as part of my project and hence I pose this question.p

Negative 491 pTo get a sense for how Cs threading constructs work, Ive written a simple test program that performs the same task  sleeping for 3 seconds then returning an object  both synchronously and asynchronously.  Ive set up some stopwatches to get a better sense as to how the code is flowing.p  pThe synchronous call is working as expected theres a 3 sec delay between the before sync and after sync prints.  However, for the async call, the program hangs indefinitely after after async.  Im expecting before async and after async to print quickly in succession since codeExecuteAsynccode just returns a Task, then for awaited async to print three seconds later or rather, at least three seconds later if there was a ton of logic between codeExecuteAsynccode and when that Task is awaited, it might be longer.p  precodenamespace TaskTest      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      doStuff.Wait              Console.WriteLinePress any key to end             Console.ReadKey                   static async Task doStuff                      TestClass tceOn  new TestClasstrue              Stopwatch s  Stopwatch.StartNew              s.CheckpointBefore sync on             tceOn.ExecuteSync             s.CheckpointAfter sync on              Console.WriteLine              s.CheckpointBefore async on             TaskltFoogt fooTask  tceOn.ExecuteAsync             s.CheckpointAfter async on              Foo foo  await fooTask             s.CheckpointAwaited async on                    class TestClass               public bool ShouldWait  false          public TestClassbool tce                      ShouldWait  tce                   public TaskltFoogt ExecuteAsync                      TaskltFoogt output             RunExecuteout output, true             return output                  public Foo ExecuteSync                      TaskltFoogt dud             return RunExecuteout dud                   private Foo RunExecuteout TaskltFoogt task, bool async  false                      Foo outputFoo              ifasync                              task  new TaskltFoogtmakeFoo                 outputFoo  null                           else                              task  null                 outputFoo  makeFoo                           return outputFoo                   private Foo makeFoo                      if ShouldWait                 Thread.Sleep3000             return new Foo                    class Foo    codepre  pTo clean it up a bit, I didnt paste the extension method for Stopwatchs codeCheckpointcode method it just prints the number of ticks so I can get a sense for the time elapsed.p  pemSoem, why isnt this code working as expected  I was hoping this would be a simplest thing that could possibly worktype scenario.

Negative 491 pIm running Wordpress 4.1 with the TinyMCE editor. In the TinyMCE editor, Ive enabled the Advanced Lists plugin, which allows customizing the list style type of list items ex. codeltli styleliststyletype loweralphagtcode.p  pWhen I submit a post with a modified list style, the codeliststyletypecode declaration gets stripped out, but other CSS declarations are just fine ex. codetextaligncode.p  pLooking at the Wordpress source, the CSS is being filtered by the codesafecssfilterattrcode function in codekses.phpcode. In codesafecssfilterattrcode I can see an array of CSS declarations. If I add codeliststyletypecode to that array, I can then save my post, and codeliststyletypecode is no longer filtered out.p  pHowever, editing the Wordpress source isnt maintainable, as itll eventually be overwritten when Wordpress is upgraded.

Negative 491 pI am trying to mix two audio in Windows media foundation. In MATLAB I did it adding sample by sample from each audio. In windows media foundation I can access the samples using codeIMFSourceReadercode and codeIMFSamplecode which gives me a chunk of data for some duration. For example first call to codesourceReadergtReadSamplecode gives me first codetcode duration of data. next call to it gives me next codetcode turation of data. Each t duration of data lies in buffer size of codeLcode.p  pWhen I tried to access the audio samples using media foundation this way I expected that the duration codetcode and buffer length codeLcode would be same each time I call codeReadSamplecode. But I get different t and L each time I call codeReadSamplecode for the audios. For example some times I get buffer length 16384, duration 928798 in 100 nanosecond unit and sometimes I get buffer length 8192 with duration 464399.p  pThis is a huge problem for me as I cannot add two audio with different buffer length and duration.

I think itll be one of the only websites that will have this information in roughly the same format. I also plan to do this with books as well.p  pI originally read about scraping at this website a hrefhttpwww.wiseowl.co.ukblogs393scrapewebsitehtml.htm relnofollowhttpwww.wiseowl.co.ukblogs393scrapewebsitehtml.htmap  pHowever, Id never done anything with the getelementby, so I wasnt sure how they worked. Any help there would be appreciated. After scouring the internet, the following is the best code I could piece togetherp  precode Private Sub cmdTestClick to refer to the running copy of Internet Explorer Dim ie As InternetExplorer to refer to the HTML document returned Dim html As HTMLDocument for iteration Dim i As Integer Dim j As Integer  open Internet Explorer in memory, and go to website Set ie  New InternetExplorer ie.Visible  False ie.navigate httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofArcherepisodes ie.navigate httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofTheSimpsonsepisodes  Wait until IE is done loading page Do While ie.READYSTATE ltgt READYSTATECOMPLETE Application.StatusBar  Trying to go to Episodes ...

I have it currently set to pull the episodes from the tv show Archer. The following codep  precodei  4      For Each ele In html.getElementsByClassNamesummary         SheetsWiki2.RangeB amp i.Value  ele.innerText         i  i  1     Next      i  4      For Each ele In html.getElementsByClassNamemwheadline          SheetsWiki2.RangeA amp i.Value  Leftele.innerText, 8          i  i  1      Next codepre  pis what Im using to pull the text Im looking for. What I need help with is combining these together. I need it to loop through and find each instance of mwheadline and every time if finds that, to look for the class name summary. If it finds summary, then it should display the headlines aka Season inner text in the cell of column A and the summary aka episode name in the adjacent column B cell.p  pThese currently work independently. If you run this code, you get all the episodes of the tv show starting in cell b4 and you get a list of everything with the mwheadline listed in a4. The problem is that mwheadline is not only applied to the season, but to a couple of other things as well, hence the need to check to see if it has a summary class under it. This will also get rid of the instances where it says a tv show has a new season, but under it, it only says that a new season is forth coming. Without the summary tag, it shouldnt list it. Id like the season to be displayed in the A column beside every episode in the B column list, so if there are 10 episodes in each season, then column A would have 10 instances of Season 1, then 10 instances of Season 2 and so on.p  pThanks for the help and for anyone who doesnt know of stumbles on this question in the future, you need to put the following code at the top of your coding windowp  precodeEnum READYSTATE  READYSTATEUNINITIALIZED  0  READYSTATELOADING  1  READYSTATELOADED  2  READYSTATEINTERACTIVE  3  READYSTATECOMPLETE  4  End Enum codepre  pPS  In the code For Each ele in , is ele an undefined variable or is it a vba recognized word that stands for element I got this from a copy and paste job and I dont understand it. Thanks.p

If I write this in jsfiddle a hrefhttpfiddle.jshell.nette4sjtcz relnofollowhttpfiddle.jshell.nette4sjtcza, everything is OK, the draggable object is still draggable after the draggabledestroy.p  pIf I use console.logui.draggable.draggableinstance, it producesp  ul liBefore destroy codeltdiv.... etc.codeli liAfter destroy undefinedli liAfter reattach draggable codeltdiv.... etccodeli ul  pOther info is that if I use ui.draggable.draggableoption,key,value format for setup, everything is fine again. Why I cant use the simple .draggable format in my code and why does it work in jsfiddle I use the same libraryp  pUpdate 1 I see that the destory removes these classes uidraggable uidraggablehandle, and after reattach I dont see them.p  pUpdate 2 If I put the reattach block into a setTimeoutHERE,0, it works. But its not a good workaround... because I dont know why it solved the problem.p

Negative 491 pIve developed a MVC5 application. The database context derives from codeIdentityDbContextcode.  When Im creating an instance of the database context and it calls to the base class, the codeIdentityDbContextcode is calling a codeDatabase.Existscode method.p  pIs there anyway I can stop this because when a user hits the login page, it requires a codeUserManagercode which requires a codeDbContextcode and so it queries the database to see if the database exists.  p  pIn any case on every page, my controller constructors sets this codeUserManagercode so this query is always being sent.p  pThanks.p
Negative 491 pI have an app that displays distances and volumes. I have a SettingsFragment that allows me to choose the units for distance, mile or km, and for volume, gallon or liter. Changing between units works but not right away, I have to flip the phone or reset the app to see the changes. I want the setting change to be reflected right away on the main activity but Im not sure how to accomplish this. I have done some reseach and found a possible solution The settings a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuisettings.htmlListening relnofollowguidea suggest that I should implement the OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener interface to listen for changes. But this is implemented on PreferenceFragment and not on a different activity. This is a similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2633769afterchangingapreferenceasettingtextshowingsettingsdoesntupdatesolutiona.p  pIm confused on what is the proper way to listen for the setting change on the main activity and how, when the change happens, I should refresh the view. Can anyone please clarifyp

Negative 491 pIm using JIRA 6.3.15. Im using codeProjectCategoryChangeEventcode to catch the event of changing project category. When this event is triggered I have to do something like that A custom field X have a context for old project category A and a context for new project category B and if the X context for A is different of X context for B do something. The problem is that the event is triggered after the project category change is done and because of that the contexts will merge and always will be the same. p  pDoes someone know how can I trigger the event before the contexts are mergedp

Negative 491 pI have a report rdlc file made on VS2008 and can work on both Report Viewer 2008 amp 2010. p  pThen I converted the rdlc report file to Report Viewer 2010 by using codexmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comsqlserverreporting201001reportdefinitioncode and using codeltReportSectionsgtcode appropriately inside the file.

The image pdflogo.jpg isbr   160 dpibr   160 x 160 physical pixels in resolution.br   So is 1 inch x 1 inch in size.br p The logs in the above code also returned the following p 0422 115550.607 IApp7856 pdf canvas density  160br 0422 115550.607 IApp7856 pdf UOD logo density  160br p This shows that the image dpi matches the Canvas density as well. However, when the image is drawn onto the pdf document, the image is much larger than 1 inch x 1 inch. It is about double the size , just over 2 inch x 2 inch. p My suspicion is that Android has used the physical resolution of the image 160 x 160 and converted it into the PdfDocument.Page size units, Postscript points which are 172 inch. So 160 Postscript points equates to 2.2 inches  double the size of the original image 1 x 1 inch. p If I halve the size of the image then I get pixelation, as it will effectively be drawing an 0.5 x 0.5 inch image into a 1 x 1 inch space. p I would like to know how I can draw an image as actual size on a PdfDocument.Page, without having these scalingsize issues.p

Negative 491 pweve a persistence archive containing only Entities and the persistence.xml. And weve an ejb module containing the ejb stuff.p  pNow for a specific use case we need to add an EntityListener which has access to some EJBs in the service layer.p  pThe ejb module depends on the persistence module. However to declare the listener in the Entity the persistence module needs to know about the class in the ejb module. A cyclic dependency is not possible and having a third module containing only the JPA listener leads to cyclic dependencies as well.p  pSo the only option I see is to merge the ejb module and the persistence archive into a single module. However that way we loose the flexibility to use the persistence archive in another application to connect to the remote interfaces without carrying the whole ejb jars content.p  pAny ideas on how to solve this and stay modular separate ejb and persistence modules.p  pWere talking about a JEE7 application. p

I can achieve this in a Text Editor with findreplace, by finding a line break followed by the string PART and replace this with a space character.  I need to automate this procedure with a batch file, as I will have around 80 .txt files in a folder that this should be ran against.  Ideally the batch file should create a renamed copy of the original file, leaving the original unedited. p  pAll I have managed to find thus far is how to remove ALL line breaks. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 491 pI have a transparent form, on which I need to place a semitransparent panel. Ive gotten the panel to be semitransparent relative to the forms color, but whenever I set the form to transparent, that semi transparency stops working. It seems it is only blending the color with the color of the control behind it, but when the form is transparent it doesnt do so with any windows that may be behind the form.p  pIs there any way this can be achieved Im not sure if I should be overwriting the forms paint method, the controls, or both.p  pAny help is appreciated Thanksp
Negative 491 pAs everyone knows, everything is an object in Python. What Im wondering about is whether its possible to create an object codexcode such that codeisinstancex, objectcode returns codeFalsecode. I suspect its possible with sufficient abuse of the CPython API, though achieving this with pure Python would be even more interesting.p  pInitially I thought that oldstyle classes would return codeFalsecode since the object hierarchy might not fully apply, but it seems like codeisinstancex, objectcode is indeed codeTruecode for instances of oldstyle classes.p  pWhile this is mostly of theoretical interest, it might be interesting or dangerous if Python allows the creation of a new object hierarchy disconnected from the base codeobjectcode type.p

Error output is p  precodestatusText  [Exception... ltno messagegt  nsresult 0x805e0006 ltunknowngt  location JS frame  httplocalhostsbkchbackendbackendassetsjspluginspacepace.min.js  baa.open  line 2  data no] codepre  pHowever, as soon as I change the name of the controller to Adthisisalongname, things start working as expected. I tried playing around and renamed my controller to Adverts. AJAX stopped working. Other methods are working fine index, etc. I then changed the name to Advendor and AJAX started working again. What seems to be the problem Are Adverts and Ad reserved keywords in Codeigniter I couldnt find any documentation pertaining to the same. Please note that when the AJAX calls dont work, it doesnt even show up in Firebug as request being made to the server in the Console tab. Also, I am not using codeformopencode function.p

Negative 491 pIm using Valgrind to track and debug memory leaks in my application, and Ive come across some odd behavior.  The application seems to have a memory leak coming from an STL vector heap allocation storing byvalue objects, not pointers.  Every instance of new stdvector Ive used is wrapped in a uniqueptr, so they should all be deleted, along with the contained objects.p  pThe odd thing is, Valgrind only reports this leak about 75 of the time.  The other 25 shows no leaks of any kind.  Im not modifying or even rebuilding the application in between trials.p  pAnybody ever come across a Heisenleak like thisp  pEDITp  pThe leak summary shows 7 blocks definitely lost the vector itself along with 7 blocks indirectly lost the memory allocated within the vector.p

Negative 491 pI have a general question regarding the architecture and flow for a login in a mobile app with azure.p  pSo far i created a custom login with an account table id, username....  But i also want to allow the user to login with his facebook account. Azur already provides a login over facebook but how can i combine the facebook login with the account tablep  pAnother thing that i am thinking about is It is a cordova app and there is already a facebook plugin for cordova. Should i forget about it because of the azure mobile service. After the user logged in over facebook i also want to use the facebook api, i guess for that i need the cordova plugin. So maybe it is a good idea to use the cordova plugin login and send the login info to my azur custom login service to store the info to the account table Any other suggestions p  pMaybe somene can help me or knows another resource where this problem has already been discussed so far i didnt find anythingp

Negative 491 pWe are running an event sourced system in Microsoft Azure. The system uses SQL Azure for persistence. There is one table were we frequently insert a lot of data, sometimes with a payload up to 20k.p  pThen there is a worker, which periodically fetches the latest data from the table for processing. It uses the identity column, to fetch the next 512 entries ahead of the previously read.p  pWe have seen that during intensive workloads, it occasionally skips entries. As if certain rows are made available before rows with lower identity value. We havent had this problem running a regular on site SQL Server, but in Azure SQL we periodically see this problem.p  pWhat available options are there, except changing event store persistence solutionp
Negative 491 pThe second argument of the method codeViewGroup.addViewcode is a codeViewGroup.LayoutParamscode. In many cases youd want to use a subclass such as codeRelativeLayout.LayoutParamscode, but annoyingly theres no typesafety in the method  signature, so the following all compile and apparently work.p  precoderelativeLayout.addViewtextView, new ViewGroup.LayoutParamsWRAPCONTENT, WRAPCONTENT  relativeLayout.addViewtextView, new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsWRAPCONTENT, WRAPCONTENT  relativeLayout.addViewtextView, new FrameLayout.LayoutParamsWRAPCONTENT, WRAPCONTENT codepre  pThis worries me slightly as it would be extremely easy to accidentally supply the wrong type. I cant understand why it was designed this way, but that is not my question.p  pObviously when a codeViewGroupcode is laid out, all of the childrens codeLayoutParamscode must at some point be cast to the appropriate type in order to read any extra rules. Can I be sure that for all of the standard subclasses of codeViewGroupcode that all of these casts are checked casts i.e. follow an codeinstanceofcode, so that if I supply the wrong type I will never get a codeClassCastExceptioncode at runtimep

I have also read the differences, but all that techinical mumbo jumbo does not help me to understand the practical differences. It is 2015 and frameworks have matured.

Negative 491 pIn an ASP.NET Web API application, some of the models Im working with contain a chunk of adhoc JSON that is useful only on the client side.
