Positive 77851 pI am in a situation where I need to check if preferredMaxLayoutWidth is set to automatic. Im using a custom subclass of UILabel, and in that subclass, I am setting the preferredMaxLayoutWidth every time the user calls codelayoutSubviewscode or codeintrinsicContentSizecode. The issue occurs in just one of my views, on iOS 9 on an iPhone 5S or earlier, so its a very limited issue.p  pWhat happens is the text gets truncated instead of word wrapping. This seems to be fixed by setting the preferredMaxLayoutWidth to automatic in the storyboard, and removing the manual setting of it in the two methods before, however, this breaks other uses of this UILabel subclass across the app. So Id like to only set it if preferredMaxLayoutWidth is not set to automatic, otherwise Id like to skip over setting it.p  pIve searched and searched and havent found a good way to check if its set to automatic. Checking if preferedMaxLayoutWidth is equal to zero was my first and only thing Ive come across to try, and that didnt work.p  pId prefer to not subclass this subclass for just this one usecase, as this issue may pop up elsewhere across the app, it would be nice to be able to fix it by just setting this one property and having my custom subclass handle that change in properties. Any ideas on how to check if preferredMaxlayoutWidth is set to automatic or notp

Positive 77851 pIve implemented a UIScrollView within a UITableViewCell that enables the user to scroll left and right to reveal buttons in the same fashion as the iOS Mail app. The original implementation that set frames and positions explicitly worked well but Ive refactored the code to use autolayout throughout.

If you create   constraints between the container view and its label and image   subviews, and you dont create any explicit width constraints on the   container or the label, then the label will size itself to fit its   content, and the container will size itself to fit its subviews.

Positive 77851 pIn the .gif below, I have a view that is the same size as the device screen with the beige background.  That view has a subview with the purple background, which Ive positioned using Auto Layout.

Positive 77851 pI am having trouble using UIScrollView with Autolayout with the resulting layout being able to be localized. p  pIn the normal examples, we are told to embed a contentView of type UIView of into the UIScrollview with its sides pinned to the 4 sides of the scrollview. The contentView must have explicit size, and subviews of this contentView will be pinned and sized accordingly. Easy enough.p  pHowever, this doesnt take into account localization. Apples guidelines for localization state that UILabels and other string holding UIView types should not have an explicit width to account for content length. If UILabel subviews of the contentView are not given explicit widths, then the contentView also cannot have explicit width.

Positive 77851 pIm trying to adjust the origin.y value of a UIViews frame.  The problem that Im running into is that the elements arent moving with the frame with negative offsets.  When I give the origin.y a positive value, it works perfectly the view drops down, leaving black above, and the elements shift down as well.  With a negative value, on the other hand, the view moves correctly, leaving black below, but the elements dont change position.  I feel like the problem might be with autolayout, and the elements remaining trapped by the top of the screen, not the top of the UIView.p  pAny ideas on how to fix thisp

Negative 77851 pThis is a question for a WSSSharePoint guru. p  pConsider this scenario I have an ASP.Net web service which links our corporate CRM system and WSSbased intranet together. What I am trying to do is provision a new WSS site collection whenever a new client is added to the CRM system. In order to make this work, I need to programmatically add the managed path to the new site collection.

Research suggested that this may be due to insufficient privileges, I tried running the code within an elevated privileges block using SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivilegesAddressOf AddManagedPath, where AddManagedPath is a Sub procedure containing the above code sample.p  pThis then fails with an InvalidOperationException, Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object.p  pWhere am I going wrongp  pOne workaround I have managed to do is to call out to STSADM.EXE via Process.Start, supplying the requisite parameters, and this works.p  pstrongUpdatestrong whilst developing the web service, I am running it using the builtin Visual Studio 2005 web server  what security context will this be running under Can I change the security context by putting entries in web.configp  pstrongUpdatestrong I think the problem is definitely to do with not running the web service within the correct SharePoint security context. I decided to go with the workaround I suggested and shell out to STSADM, although to do this, the application pool identity that the web service runs under must be a member of the SharePoint administrators.p

Negative 77851 pI have code that handles the LostFocus event of my controls.  It validates the value and in some cases will enable a subsequent control.  For instance, there might be a ComboBox that allows a user to select a country.  The subsequent ComboBox allows the user to select a state.  IF the currently selected country is not the USA, the state ComboBox is disabled.  If the user selects USA and then tabs out of the combo box, the LostFocus code enables the state ComboBox.  However, the State ComboBox does not get focus, instead focus goes to the control that follows the State ComboBox.p  pIve tried using the PreviewLostKeyboardFocus to handle the event instead with no luck.  Im kind of at a loss as to figuring out someway to hack WPF to get this work.  Any suggestionsp

The hiddennow object has been pushed down in the queue too far and should no longer be returned when getentries is called. p  precodethis works SearchObject.findall, order gt id desc  this does not, unless the 20.times loop has sleep1 or something SearchObject.findall, order gt createdat desc codepre  pThis is simplified down a bit, but it looks like the 20.times loop adds things fast enough that the order by clause on createdat cannot distinguish. My questions are, am I doing something fundamentally wrong If not, what is the better approach to writing a test along these linesp

Negative 77851 pI have a html table in which each line codelttrgtcode represents a group of client computers. Each line can be expanded to show the clients belonging to the group. The codelttrgtcode containing the clients are always generated but hidden and showed when clicking the plus button at the beginning of each line.p  pThe clients themselves they are codeltdivgtcode can be dragged and dropped in another group as long as this group is already expanded. So far it works fine.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve now is that the client can be dragged to a collapsed group and after a second or so hovering the group it will be expanded and the client can be dropped amongst the other clients of the group.p  pI programmed the hover using the codeincode and codeoutcodeevents of the codedroppablecode and it expands the group all right, but and now it starts to be hard to explain with words  the behavior of the droppable the client is still as if the table line that appeared were not there  the codeincode codeoutcode and codedropcode events of the droppable are fired on the old position of the elements, and the codeincode codeoutcode and codedropcode events of the newly appeared codelttrgtcode are never fired.p  pIt looks as if JQuery memorizes the position, size etc. of the elements when the drag starts, and these values are not updated if there is a change in the DOM before the drop happens...p  pCan someone confirm this behavior is normal, or can it be caused by another problem in my own code  Any workaround p  pthe question is quite bloated already so I dont include any code but Ill gladly upload it if requiredp  pEdit  I cant add a picture since I am a new user but you can find one here  a hrefhttpimg69.imageshack.usimg6930920100413190123.png relnofollowhttpimg69.imageshack.usimg6930920100413190123.pngap  pVersions  JQuery is 1.3.2 and jqueryui is 1.7.2p

Negative 77851 pA while back, I needed a solution to sanely import libraries in VBScript.p  pVBScript, for reference, has no buildin import capabilities. The traditional method of importing files is to use SSI, which dumps the contents of the includee verbatim into the includer. This is lessthanoptimal for a number of reasons there is no way to avoid multiple inclusion, theres no way to specify a library directory, etc. So I wrote my own function. Its fairly simple, using codeexecuteGlobalcode with a dictionary to keep track of imported modules and wrapping the whole thing in an object for encapsulationp  precodeclass ImportFunction     private libraries      private sub CLASSINITIALIZE         set libraries  Server.createObjectScripting.Dictionary     end sub      public default property get exec name         if not libraries.existsname then              The following line will find the actual path of the named library              dim libpath set libpath  Path.resourcepathname amp .lib, libraries              on error resume next              Filesystem is a class of mine its operation should be fairly obvious              with FileSystem.openlibpath,                  executeGlobal .readAll                 if Err.number ltgt 0 then                      Response.write Error importing library                      Response.write libpath amp ltbrgt                     Response.write Err.source amp   amp Err.description                 end if             end with             on error goto 0              libraries.add name, null         end if     end property end class dim import set import  new ImportFunction   Example import MyLibrary codepre  pAnyway, this works pretty well, but its a lot of work if I dont end up using the library. Id like to make it lazy, so that the filesystem search, loading, and executing are only done if and when the library is actually used. This is simplified by the fact that each librarys features are accessed solely through a singleton object in global scope of the same name as the library. For examplep  precode StringBuilder.lib   class StringBuilderClass ... end class  class StringBuilderModule     public function [new]         set [new]  new StringBuilderClass     end function      ... end class dim StringBuilder set StringBuilder  new StringBuilderModule codepre  pnbspp  precodeimport StringBuilder dim sb set sb  StringBuilder.new codepre  pSo it seems that the obvious approach is for the lazy importer to define StringBuilder as an object that, when accessed, will load StringBuilder.lib and replace itself.p  pUnfortunately, this is made difficult by VBScripts sad lack of metaprogramming constructs. For instance, there is no analogue to Rubys codemethodmissingcode, which would have made the implementation trivial.p  pMy first thought was for the main codeimportcode function to use codeexecuteGlobalcode to create a global function named StringBuilder taking no arguments which would in turn load StringBuilder.lib and then use codeexecuteGlobalcode to shadow itself the function with the StringBuilder singleton. There are two problems with this first, using codeexecuteGlobalcode to define a function which then overrides itself using codeexecuteGlobalcode seems like a rather sketchy idea in general, and second, it turns out that in VBScript, you can only override a function with a variable if the function in question is a builtin. Oooookay.p  pThe next thought I had was doing the same thing, except instead of using codeexecuteGlobalcode to replace the function with a variable, use it to replace the function with another function which simply returned the singleton. This would require that the singleton be stored in a separate global variable. The disadvantages to this approach aside from the inherent unkosherness of the strategy are that accessing the singleton would add function call overhead and that, due to the interpreters parsing eccentricities, the singleton could no longer use default properties.p  pOverall, its a rather sticky problem, and VBScripts odd quirks are of no help. Any ideas or suggestions would be welcome.p

Negative 77851 pI am very confused over something and was wondering if someone could explain.p  pIn PHP i validate user input so htmlentitiies, mysqlrealescapestring is used before inserting into database, not on everything as i do prefer to use regular expressions when i can although i find them hard to work with. Now obviously i will use mysqlrealescapestring as the data is going into the database but not sure should i be using htmlentities only when getting data from database and displaying it on a webpage as doing so before hand is altering the data entered by a person which is not keeping its original form which may cause problems if i want to use that data later on for use for something else.p  pSo for example, i have a guestbook  with 3 fields name, subject and message. Now obviously the fields can contain anything like malicious code in js tags basically anything, now what confuses me is let say i am a malicious person and i decided to use js tags and some malicous js code and submit the form, now basically i have malicious useless data in my database. Now by using htmlentities when outputting the malicious code to the webpage guestbook that is not a problem because htmlentities has converted it to its safe equivalent but then at the same time i have useless malicious code in the database that i would rather not have.p  pSo after saying all this my question is should i accept the fact that some data in the database maybe malicious, useless data and as long as i use htmlentities on output everything will be ok or should i be doing something else aswell.p  pI read so many books saying about filtering data on receiving it and escaping it on outputting it so the original form is kept but they only ever give examples like ensuring a field is only an int using functions already built into php etc but i have never found anything in regards ensuring something like a guestbook where you want users to type anything they want but also how you would filter such data apart from mysqlrealescapestring to ensure it does not break the DB queryp  pCould someone please finally close this confusion for me and tell me what i should be doing and what is best practicep  pThanks to anyone who can explain.p  pCheersp

Negative 77851 pIve been letting UIKit handle the device rotation for me my iOS app has a codeUIViewControllercode that implements codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode and Ive been pretty happy with how straightforward it was to get it all working.p  pIve since been told though that this is slower than doing all the rotation business manually. This hasnt been borne out by my tests, however, either on an iPad iOS 4.2 or an iPod Touch 2G also iOS 4.2.p  pI was a bit surprised to be told there would be a big difference anyway, as judging by how UIKit seems to work it doesnt look like theres any scope for OpenGLES to do a page flip. So code[EAGLContext presentRenderbuffer]code pretty much has to do a copy, which will take basically the same time regardless of rotation state. The overhead of the other aspects of rotation general coordinate transforms, mainly Id imagine to be similarly negligible.p  pThats only my conjecture, though, and I have only my lying eyes to back it up So are there cases where letting UIKit handle the device rotation does actually make a big difference If so, what are they p

Negative 77851 pI did a quick search and could not find anything on this topic.  I am not even sure if this is possible, but I am curious.p  pIs it possible to compile a Java program on a server right before a user downloads the program.  The application that I can think of for this would be to modify a programs source code on the fly before a user downloads it.  This could be helpful in a setup where the program is modified based on user input or settings on a website and those changes are hard baked into the program so what they download is a stand alone program that is customized and fully portable.  The other application I thought of would be if each user were to use a different feature combination in a program so it is compiled only with the feature set they needwant on the fly.p  pI have a few programs ideas that I could test this out with, but this is mostly an academic thought and curiosity of mine.p  pSo long story short, does anyone know of any technologies that could make a system like this work  p

So for example I cant use upload date as a mark for new images. But I think this can be done with comparing ids or dates of latest images of the device and server. p  pAnother point is that I cant control API of the server and dont want to write proxy server which would communicate directly with device. But how I could then check if image was deleted from server Checking every thumbnail I have on the device would take a lot of time. I know, I can perform this check when user try to download full size image... But this doesnt seem to be good idea.p  pAre there any general patterns or methods or frameworks which would help with syncing data on iOS between webservice and device Core Datap

Along the way I get some small problems mostly because there are certain parts of the code Im not getting completely.p  pHow I did it was to bind the ModalDialogManager to a MainWindow property of the Type IDialogViewModel. I then have a WindowsManager class that handles putting the right instance inside this property. One such is EditDialogViewModel that exposes a EditableViewModel to this DialogManager. I set the EditDialog view as a DataTemplate for this EditDialogViewModel but when I show it the new window only shows a part of it.p  pHere is the Viewp  precodeltUserControl.Resourcesgt      ltResourceDictionarygt         ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt              ltResourceDictionary SourceEditDataTemplates.xaml gt          ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt     ltResourceDictionarygt  ltUserControl.Resourcesgt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Height7 gt             ltRowDefinition Height2 gt             ltRowDefinition Height1 gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltContentControl ContentBinding PathViewModel gt          ltTextBlock TextBinding PathViewModel.Error gt          ltUniformGrid Grid.Row2 Columns2gt              ltButton CommandBinding SaveCommand gt              ltButton CommandBinding CancelCommand gt          ltUniformGridgt      ltGridgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pBut the new Dialog window only shows the ContentControl bound to the ViewModel property of EditDialogViewModel it holds the ViewModel being edited.p  pMy guess is it has something to do with this code in the ModelDialogManagerp  precode void Show              if window  null Close          Window w  new Window         window  w         w.Closing  wClosing         w.Owner  GetParentWindowthis          w.DataContext  this.DataContext         w.SetBindingWindow.ContentProperty,  This code here does something I dont fully understand          w.Title  Title         w.Icon  Icon         w.Height  DialogHeight         w.Width  DialogWidth         w.ResizeMode  DialogResizeMode         w.ShowDialog      codepre  pHe is applying the binding there but I guess its only the first ContentControl that gets bound or something. Its quite tricky.p  pAnother problem is that the mouse just doesnt work inside the Modal Dialog. I can tab into the textboxes but not click into them.p  pIs there a way to fix this or a better method to handle Modal Dialog boxes in WPFp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk Im going to admit it. Im a huge idiot. This was so simple I just couldnt see it. I had set Height and Width on the UserControl to a fixed value while I was still messing around with it being a Window.

Negative 77851 pI have a web page with left and right DIVs, both set to overflow auto with content such that both divs have vertical scroll bars.p  pI use a jquery keyboard event handler attached to document to have SPACE keys and move the selection from one item in the right DIV to the next item in the right DIV.  I have a table of options on in the left DIV.  If I click on a link on the left, then hit space, the keyboard handler performs the correct operation in the right DIV, but the left DIV also scrolls down.  If I click on some blank space in the right DIV and hit space again, everything behaves correctly.p  pIt is clear to me that overflowing DIVs and presumably other block elements have focus, but I cant find any discussion on how to manipulate this, nor can I find any information on blocking key events to default handlers.  I know there must be a way because Google Reader doesnt have the same problem, but so far I havent been able to figure out what they are doing to get the behavior I desire.p

Negative 77851 pIm having an extreme amount of difficulty in getting my PXListView and NSScrollView setup to work nicely. Heres the gist of it p  pI have a dashboard page that is to contain 2 PXListViews. One of them gets its data from Core Data, the other from an RSS Feed. Both of these are added to a superview and associated controller I have modes other than Dashboard so this was the most efficient way.  This superview becomes the documentView for my NSScrollView.p  pI can get all of this to work nicely except with the RSS feed based List View. I am getting the feed asynchronously so that it doesnt hold up the UI and once a feed has been received and the List View populated I have it automatically resize itself. This all works great, however I then need to resize my Dashboard View in order to get the scrollbars up. So I send a notification which leads to an autosizeView method I created but it all goes to hell. p  pThe two ListViews start to overlap and the contents of the top one end up in the bottom one. Screenshot below red is the bounds rectangle, blue the frame of each Subviewp  pThis is before calling autosizeViewimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYrojH.png altenter image description herep  pThis is after calling it img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwnxBE.png altenter image description herep  pAnd for good measure, this is what it looks like if I resize the PXListViews and dont call the DashboardViews autosize method img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1Zesx.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, it works fine as long as I dont call autosizeViews but then I dont get the scrollers happening.

Negative 77851 p Im having the following problem I have a view and i want to add borders to it. What Im currently trying to do is to set padding to the view padding from all the sides and set background color to it which will fill the padding.

I.e if i writep  precodeview.setPaddingborder,border,border,border codepre  pthis will set padding only from top and left. In order to set padding from bottom and right I have to writep  precodeview.setPaddingborder,border,0,0 codepre  pwhich wont leave left and top padding and so on. If I try to use margin it moves the whole blockthe view  the padding area, but not only the view, so this doesnt seem to work either.

Negative 77851 pIs there an established best practice for handling external dependencies in TFS working branches What I mean is, we have a project in TFS that contains common thirdparty libraries in this case Im specifically dealing with log4net, which we branch into our other projects as needed. Now were making a significant change that Im doing on a separate working branch, which requires a newer version of the component. It looks basically like thisp  precodeThirdParty   bin     log4net  Product   Main     thirdparty       lognet      lt ThirdPartybinlog4net   Working1        lt ProductMain     thirdparty       log4net     lt ProductMainlognet lt ThirdPartybinlog4net codepre  pPart of the work requires rebuilding log4net against the .NET 4 client profile and bringing in the new version. Normally, when we upgrade a third party component, its checked into codeThirdpartycode in the appropriate folder, then the individual projects are free to merge the latest binary, or not, as they see fit.p  pAs far as I have can determine, in order to get the latest changeset from codeThirdPartybinlog4netcode I need to merge that into codeProductMaincode, strongcheck the merge into TFSstrong, then merge that branch into codeProductWorking1code. Thats exactly what I want to avoid, because I dont want to disrupt the main branch.p  pSo, I guess two questionsp  ol lipIs there a way to get this merge to work without having to check anything into the main branchpli lipIs there a better overall strategy for handling these kind of dependencies while still keeping them in TFS I know TFS isnt meant for binaries, but we like it because of the easy multipleversion and history tracking we get out of it.pli ol

Negative 77851 pIm using the code found a hrefhttpwww.andygibson.netblogtutorialcodelessajaxorderedandpaginatedtablesinseam relnofollowherea for Ajax orderedpagination support for a Seam EntityQuery.  The code itself is working great, and I am able to sort my data with no problem by various parameters.  The entity itself is not a SQL table, but rather a SQL view mapped to a JPA Hibernate Entity.  That, too, seems to be working without issue, so long as I stick to SELECT statements and not try to perform an INSERT or UPDATE.  My backend DB is PostgreSQL 8.4, and I havent implemented any conditional TRIGGERs to allow for VIEW update support.p  pMy problem has to do when I go from one page of results to another using the EntityQuery.next or EntityQuery.previous methods.

Ive overridden the next method in my EntityQuery and that operation goes through successfully.  But, immediately after it finishes and right before the view is rendered the attempted UPDATE occurs.  Since my Entity object cant be updated on the backend DB since its a VIEW I get an Exception thrown.p  pIs there any way to prevent a transaction from being opened when using this EntityQuery  Ive tried annotating my Entity object with ReadOnly.  That didnt work.  Ive tried adding TransactionalNEVER to my EntityQuery.  That didnt work.  Any other ideasp
Negative 77851 pIm currently creating a managed wrapper to an unmanaged dll. Point is the wrapper does a TON of calls to the unmanaged dll but exports very few methods itself. From the research I did this should be safe but I want to make sure I get this correctly. Essentially this is how Im doing it.p  precode[SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity] internal static class SomeAPI      [DllImportbase.dll]     internal static extern bool Somefunc     [...] Other internal DllImports   public class Wrapper  IDisposable      [SecurityPermissionSecurityAction.Demand, UnmanagedCode  true]     public Wrapper              SomeAPI.SomeFunc           public void Dispose              Disposetrue         GC.SuppressFinalizethis           [SecurityPermissionSecurityAction.Demand, UnmanagedCode  true]     protected override void Disposebool disposeManagedResources              SomeAPI.SomeFunc       codepre  pEvery method I add that is protected or public should get the [SecurityPermissionSecurityAction.Demand, UnmanagedCode  true] attribute. And I mean every to avoid an accidental code path that leads to a SomeAPI call.p  pNow any method added to Wrapper that is internal or private is safe. Is that assumption correctp  pSorry if I was unclear. I am writing the wrapper so it wont reformat the hard drive or something like that. The wrapper will be exposed in its own managed dll along with other things. Because one call to the wrapper could result in 100s of calls to the unmanaged dll I dont want the performance overhead of the CLR checking all those calls  thus the use of SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity. The docs mention Use this attribute with extreme care. Incorrect use can create security weaknesses., and thats what Im asking, am I safe again with the above methodology.p

The first contains an codeExpandercode whose codeExpandDirectioncode is codeRightcode.  The second is a codeGridSplittercode.  The third contains a codeDockPanelcode full of stuff.p  pThe goal is that when the codeExpandercode is collapsed, the grid column is the width of its header.  When its expanded, the user should be able to change the width of the expanded area by dragging the codeGridSplittercode.p  pI cant figure out the right way to do this.  Dragging the codeGridSplittercode changes the width of the column, and I dont really want to change the width of the column, I want to change the maximum width of the expander.

But if I had the paging, when you scrolled, it would lock you towards the nearest vertical pane.p  pa hrefhttpwww.nikebetterworld.com relnofollowhttpwww.nikebetterworld.comap  palso, Nike better world is an awesome sitep
Negative 77851 pI would like to ask a question on how I decided to implement the MVC pattern for a simple javaEE application when I say javaEE I mean pure javaEE without any additional framework, so servlet, jsp ejbeans.... My mvc works in this wayp  pActorsp  ul liview  a set of jsp pagesli licontroller  a single servletli limodel  a set of noninstantiable java classes containing static methods.li ul  pFunctioning     each user request is managed by the servlet which decides the correct     static method to call among the classes of the model. In particular,     each form in the jsps contains 3 hidden fields classToCall, methodToCall     and destionationPage. Once the servlet receives the http post, it reads     these 3 hidden fields andp  ol licall the right method in the right class via reflection passing the HttpRequest as parameterli liforwards the user to the correct jsp which displays the result of the computation.li ol  pMy main doubt regards the implementation of the model as static classes since many frameworks tipically handle user requests by creating a bean on the fly and calling an instance method of it, I would like to know if my static model can have any contraindication.p  pThanks a lot for your help, bye Nicop
Negative 77851 pI have two rails applications both now on Rails 3.1.1, and they work nicely. However, I have a dependence between the two. Application codeAcode uses data of application codeBcode by linking to it. These links are created automatically, but they have to be computed by doing a lookup to the data of application codeBcode. Im working on Windows 7 with Ruby 1.9.2 and Thin as web server, and this will not be changed p  pI have tried the followingp  ul liUse just a RESTful resource, so defined a controller, called its action codegetxmlobjcode with some params in it, read the needed values from the XML. Worked, but needs around 0.5s to 1s per call.li liReplaced it by a hrefhttpapi.rubyonrails.orgclassesActiveResourceBase.htmlmethodcfind relnofollowActiveResourcefinda which worked as well, but with the same performance as the solution before.li liI have installed nginx and configured it so, that the connection are keepalive, so that the connection handling should be much faster. But noticed no difference at all when calling codeBcode from codeAcode.li ul  pWhen I compare the time spent, these are typical examples here with 4 references in one web pagep  pApplication Ap  precodeStarted GET taskssearchtask1803 for 127.0.0.1 at 20111102 141104 0100    Processing by TasksControllersearchtask as HTML   Parameters idgt1803 Rendered taskstooltip.html.haml 4529.5ms Completed 200 OK in 4532ms Views 4527.5ms  ActiveRecord 2.0ms cache [GET taskssearchtask1865] miss codepre  pApplication Bp  precodecache [GET servicegetxmlobjkeynoticeampvaluerails] miss  Started GET servicegetxmlobjkeynoticeampvaluerails for 127.0.0.1 at 2011 1102 141105 0100   Processing by ServiceControllergetxmlobj as    Parameters keygtnotice, valuegtrails Completed 200 OK in 6ms Views 3.0ms  ActiveRecord 1.0ms codepre  pand 3 other calls with a similar length lt 10ms.p  pSo is there something I can do to tune the retrieval without accessing the database directly Do you know of any good documentation how to measure and tune the web server and middleware These are only personal applications, so there is no way of deploying them on a decent server.

Negative 77851 pJust got a strange error. Working on project using JUnit and Maven 3.0.3 Ive created in my testsrcjava folder one test class  codeClassifierUtilTest.javacode, with codeTestcodeannotated methods and stuff, and two utility classes, just for the use in the testing env one with few static methods for bypassing private visibility scopes and one mock for tested interface. p  pIt works good under Maven 3.0.3 codemvn testcode, and in Eclipse 3.7 run as  JUnit test, but when someone else tried to codemvn testcode it with Maven 2.2.1 it failed. Apparently it tried to treat those util classes as test classes and failed due to no codeTestcodeannotated methods and more than one constructor.p  pIts not JUnit fault at least it shouldnt be, maven dependency is the same, codejunitjunit4.9code, so it seems to be strictly maven or codemavensurefireplugincode fault. I was wondering if there is some widelyknown workaround for Maven 2.2.1 for this problemp
Negative 77851 pIs it possible to achieve distributed reads from HDSF cluster using an HDFS client on one machinep  pI have carried out an experiment with a cluster consisting of 3 data nodes DN1,DN2,DN3.

Other data nodes DN2,DN3 were showing zero activity judging from debug logs. p  pI have checked that all files blocks are replicated across all 3 datanodes, so if I shut down DN1 then data is read from DN2 DN2 only.p  pIncreasing the amount of data read did not help tried from 2GB to 30GB. p  pSince I have a need to read multiple large files and extract only a small amount of data from it few Kb, I would like to avoid using mapreduce since it requires settings up more services and also requires writing the output of each split task back to HDFS.

Negative 77851 pIm a beginner iOSObjectiveC coder and am trying to understand some details rather than just dumbly following the example code I see.p  pI think I get the gist of a forward declaration in a .h file it tells the compiler that the specified class is a player to be defined later  and then the header is imported in the .m file.p  pWhat I dont understand is why not just import the class header in the header where the class is referenced, rather than use a forward declaration My understanding of import is it wont import the header more than once as would include  which necessitates the ifdef stuff.p  pDo I have this all wrongp

Commonly, we need to just delete tables and let them fully regenerate from the database.p  pThe issue at hand is that we have multiple recursive relationshipsproperties.

Negative 77851 pOut of curiosity emhow does the CLR dispatch virtual method calls to interface members to the correct implementationemp  pI know about the VTable that the CLR maintains for each type with method slots for each method, and the fact that for each interface it has an additional list of method slots that point to the associated interface method implementations. But I dont understand the following how does the CLR efficiently determine which interface method slot list to pick from the types VTablep  pThe article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163791.aspxHow the CLR Creates Runtime Objectsa talks about a processlevel mapping table IVMap indexed by interface ID. Does this mean that all types in the same process have the same pointer to the same IVMapp  pIt also states thatp  blockquote   pIf codeMyInterface1code is implemented by two classes, there will be two   entries in the IVMap table. The entry will point back to the beginning   of the subtable embedded within the codeMyClasscode method table.p blockquote  pHow does the CLR know which entry to pick Does it do a linear search to find the entry that matches the current type Or a binary search Or some kind of direct indexing and have a map with possibly many empty entries in itp  pIve also read the chapter on Interfaces in CLR via C 3rd edition but it does not talk about this. Therefore, the answers to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3262428howdoesnetclrimplementaninterfaceinternallythis other questiona do not answer my question.p

This is all working fine to update the entire form on each change.  The problem Im having is that since Im using serialize to pass the elements to AJAX its saving the ENTIRE form with each change of a form element.  This is ok for smaller pages, but some pages the form can be huge and saving the form 20 times is going to slow things down.p  pWhat Id like to do is just save individual form elements when they are changed instead of the entire form.

For example in the version I posted above Im able to pass the SecID variable and since Im using serialize it will send everything.  But if I only want to send a change to a single form element at a time, but also include the SecID variable or additional variables, how would I change this to accomplish itp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 77851 pHas Groovy a simple solution for comparing two Java beans with nested beans without using their equals, i.e. comparing all primitivejava.lang. fields in them and then do the same recursively for the remaining fields In the case of inequality Id of course like to get a nice report about what was eqaul and what wasnt.

Negative 77851 pThe essence of my question is how to compose these objects see below in a sensible way with MVC3 and Ninject though I am not sure DI should be playing a role in the solution. I cant disclose the real details of my project but here is an approximation which illustrates the issuequestion. Answers in either VB or C are appreciatedp  pI have several different products with widely varying properties yet all of them need to be represented in a catalog. Each product class has a corresponding table in my database. A catalog entry has a handful of properties specific to being a catalog entry and consequently have their own table. I have defined an interface for the catalog entries with the intent that calling the DescriptionText property will give me very different results based on the underlying concrete type. p  precodePublic Class Clothing     Property Identity as Int64     Property AvailableSizes As ListOf String     Property AvailableColor As ListOf String End Class  Public Class Fasteners     Property Identity as Int64     Property AvailableSizes As ListOf String     Property AvailableFinishes As ListOf String     Property IsMetric As Boolean End Class  Public Interface ICatalogEntry     Property ProductId as Int64     Property PublishedOn As DateTime     Property DescriptionText As String End Interface codepre  pGiven that the DescriptionText is a presentation layer concern I dont want to implement the ICatalogEntry interface in my product classes. Instead I want to delegate that to some kind of formatter.p  precodePublic Interface ICatalogEntryFormatter     Property DescriptionText As String End Interface  Public Class ClothingCatalogEntryFormatter     Implements ICatalogEntryFormatter      Property DescriptionText As String End Class  Public Class FastenerCatalogEntryFormatter     Implements ICatalogEntryFormatter      Property DescriptionText As String End Class codepre  pIn a controller somewhere there will be code like thisp  precodeDim entries As ListOf ICatalogEntry                     catalogService.CurrentCatalogDateTime.Now codepre  pIn a view somewhere there will be code like thisp  precodeltulgt For Each entry As ICatalogEntry In Model.Catalog     ltligtentry.DescriptionTextltligt Next ltulgt codepre  pSo the question is what do the constructors look like How to set it up so the appropriate objects are instantiated in the right places. Seems like generics or maybe DI can help with this but I seem to be having a mental block. The only idea Ive come up with is to add a ProductType property to ICatalogEntry and then implement a factory like thisp  precodePublic Class CatalogEntryFactory     Public Function CreatecatEntry as ICatalogEntry As ICatalogEntry         Select Case catEntry.ProductType         Case Clothing             Dim clothingProduct  clothingService.GetcatEntry.ProductId             Dim clothingEntry  New ClothingCatalogEntryclothingProduct             Return result         Case Fastener             Dim fastenerProduct  fastenerService.GetcatEntry.ProductId             Dim fastenerEntry  New FastenerCatalogEntryfastenerProduct             fastenerEntry.Formatter  New FastenerCatalogEntryFormatter             Return fastenerEntry     ...          End Function End Class  Public ClothingCatalogEntry     Public Sub New product As ClothingProduct         Me.Formatter   New ClothingCatalogEntryFormatterproduct     End Sub      Property DescriptionText As String         Get             Return Me.Formatter.DescriptionText         End Get     End Property End Class  ...FastenerCatalogEntry is omitted but you get the idea...  Public Class CatalogService     Public Function CurrentCatalogcurrentDate as DateTime         Dim theCatalog As ListOf ICatalogEntry                                    Me.repository.GetCatalogcurrentDate          Dim theResult As New ListOf ICatalogEntry          For Each entry As ICataLogEntry In theCatalog             theResult.Addfactory.Createentry         Next          Return theResult     End Function End Class codepre  pIMHO, I am not really getting any smells off this code other than having to change the factory for every new product class that comes along. Yet, my gut says that this is the old way of doing things and nowadays DI andor generics can do this better. Suggestions on how to handle this are much appreciated as are suggestions on a better title...p

Negative 77851 pFirst time asking a question on the stack exchange, hopefully this is the right place.p  pI cant seem to develop a close enough approximation algorithm for my situation as Im not exactly the best in terms of 3D math.p  pI have a 3d environment in which I can access the position and rotation of any object, including my camera, as well as run trace lines from any two points to get distances between a point and a point of collision. I also have my cameras field of view. I do not have any form of access to the worldviewprojection matrices however.p  pI also have a collection of 2d images that are basically a set of screenshots of the 3d environment from the camera, each collection is from the same point and angle and the average set is taken at about an average of a 60 degree angle down from the horizon.p  pI have been able to get to the point of using registration point entities that can be placed in the 3d world that represent the corners of the 2d image, and then when a point is picked on the 2d image it is read as a coordinate with range 01, which is then interpolated between the 3d positions of the registration points. This seems to work well, but only if the image is a perfect top down angle. When the camera is tilted and another dimension of perspective is introduced, the results become more grossly inaccurate as there no compensation for this perspective.p  pI dont need to be able to calculate the height of a point, say a window on a sky scraper, but at least the coordinate at the base of the image plane, or which if I extend a line out from my image from a specified image space point I need at least the point that the line will intersect with the ground if there was nothing in the way.p  pAll of the material I found about this says to just deproject the point using the worldviewprojection matrices, which I find straightforward in itself except I dont have access to these matrices, just data I can collect at screenshot time and other algorithms use complex maths I simply dont grasp yet.p  pOne end goal of this would be able to place markers in the 3d environment where a user clicks in the image, while not being able to run a simple deprojection from the users view.p  pAny help would be appreciated, thanks.p  pstrongEditstrong Herp derp, while my implementation for doing so is a bit odd due to the limitations of my situation, the solution essentially boiled down to ananthonlines answer about simply recalculating the viewprojection matrices. p

Negative 77851 pI have no clue if what I am trying to do is possible or not. I am not experienced with blocks, just read a few tutorials, and really like the idea. My class AppointmentView.h and m is extending a ViewController. It contains a few properties which are members of another Class Appointment, which in turn has a few NSArrays. For the purpose of creating a grouped tableview, I check the values of the arrays, and then copy appropriately values that will be displayed nothing too fancy or complicated. Normally I would go with ifelse statements, and control appropriately, however after looking at blocks, it got me thinking if the following is doablep  precode[self setOutcomes [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects                          return [myAppointment.CANCELED isEqualToStringNO]  YES                                                               [[NSString alloc] initWithStringNot Cancelled]                                                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringCancelled] ,                          return [myAppointment.CANCELED isEqualToStringNO]  YES                                                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringNo Cancellation reason]                                                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringmyAppointment.CANCREASON] ,                          return [myAppointment EVENTS].length gt 0                                                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringmyAppointment.EVENTS]                                                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringNo Events] ,                          return [myAppointment SUMMARY].length gt 0                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringmyAppointment.SUMMARY]                              [[NSString alloc] initWithStringNo Summary] ,                         nil]] codepre  pThis code compiles fine, but it crashes when run.

So, I was wondering, is this possible  I know that for this piece of code, I could simply use an ifelse like I normally would and be done with it, but other circumstances, such a dynamic code generation option would be extremely useful.p  pI got the feeling that either NSString does not know how to handle this, and I should therefore extend it with an options lets say p  blockquote   pinitWithBlockp blockquote  pOr I am missing something else here. Or it may just be not possible.... p  pPS I have just seen NSArrays enumerateUsingBlock method, but I am not certain if this would serve my purpose in this case, as each entry in the array is completely different from the other, and a specific block would not fit the criteria.p

Negative 77851 pI am designingdeveloping a web application that will ultimately deploy as a WAR to Tomcat.

I should probably make it known that Im using OpenGL ES 2. Any helpp
Negative 77851 pIm doing a kirbyesque type game and Im having issues with my sprite rotating on during flight as well as falling. Once the sprite is tapped it rotates CCW slightly and then rises.

Negative 77851 pIm working on a baremetal cortexM3 in C for fun and profit.p  pLately I decided to try and use the STL library as I needed some containers. I thought that by simply providing my allocator it wouldnt add much code to the final binary, since you get only what you use. I actually didnt even expect any linking process at all with the STL giving my allocator, as I thought it was all template code.p  pI am compiling with fnoexception by the way.p  pUnfortunately, about 600KB or more are added to my binary. I looked up what symbols are included in the final binary with nm and it seemed a joke to me. The list is so long I wont try and past it.

Negative 77851 pI have two different header files I have to include one is the standard assert.h, both with an assert function. I have no control over these header files so I cant change them.

Negative 77851 pIm trying to use Google Map in Android Application. MainActivity contains EditText, ImageButton and MapView. When user gives some query and taps ImageButton, MainAcitivity is supposed to get some JSON data from a url and then I need to use that JSON data to create Markers and dialogBox when user clicks those Markers. Whenever I run the application, it runs fine. But when I click ImageButton, application stops giving logcat error NetworkOnMainThreadException and StrickModeAndroidBlockGuardPolicy. Ive attached logcat output and MainActivity. Ive run this JSON program creating other test project and it is working just fine. But when I add it to MainAcitivity, it doesnt work. I believe, androids security policies are stopping it from getting data from url.p  pSo what is the reason of this error and how can I make this Activity work Thank You very much friends for paying attention.

Negative 77851 pIve created a Class Mediator in which I want to intersect two policies. Ive created the Class Mediator with Carbon Studio for Eclipse, which automatically adds some predefined libs to the build path of my project.p  pOne of the libs is neethi2.0.4.wso2v1.jar.p  pIf I want to use the intersectmethod I get an exception. If I have a look at the source I see that the intersectmethod just throws an UnsupportedOperationException.p  pSo the given neethi lib is useless for intersection, therefore I want to use the newest Neethi lib aka neethi3.0.2.lib for intersection inside my class mediator.p  pCould you tell me how I can include third party libs, especially in my use case these ones, that should override the once used inside the esb neethi2.0.4.wso2v1.jar.p  pThanksp

Im completely new to FastCGI. I read on the FCGI website that there are two interfaces  fcgistdio and fcgiapp. fcgistdio is a wrapper around fcgiapp, and is aimed at porting legacy cgi apps. Since Im writing from scratch, Id like to skip the middle man and use fcgiapp directly.p  pHowever I do not see how I can initialize it properly. I know that it can use either Named Pipes or Sockets for communication with the server Im writing on Windows at first, and will try Linux later, but there is no initialization function to which I can pass a pipe name or a port number. Neither does it use environment variables, as far as I can tell. Ive studied the code but it makes little sense. The few functions which do take some kind of socket or port parameter usually nullify it at the first line making me wonder why there was a parameter in the first place.p  pSo... how do you do it Or is the library just a starting point, an you need extensive tweaking to get it to workp

Negative 77851 pI know how to program in Python but I am also interested in learning C. I have heard that it is much faster than python and for the programs I am writing currently, I would prefer them to run as quickly and efficiently as possible. I know that a lot of that comes from just writing good code but I was also wondering if using another language, such as C, would help. p  pWhile I was pondering this, I realized that since most of my programs will be mainly using the internet as in implementing Google APIs and using the information from them to submit data to other websites then maybe the speed of the language doesnt matter if the speed of my internet connection is always going to be relatively the same. I have two ways I am connecting to the internet Selenium or some kind of automated browser for things that require a browser, and just HTTP requests. p  pHow much difference would I see between python and a different language even though the major focus of my programs is on the internetp  pThanks.p

I dont need to do a conversion, I just want it written back out the way I read it in p  precode    StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder     string text  File.ReadAllTextfilePath     for int i  0 i lt text.Length i          if text[i]      looking for opening curly brace             sb.Appendtext[i]             continue                   Do stuff          File.WriteAllTextdestinationFile, sb.ToString codepre  pI tried using different Encodings UTF8, UTF16, ASCII, but then it just came out even worse I started getting question mark symbols and Chinese characters yes, a bit of a shotgun approach, but I was just experimenting. I did read this article a hrefhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comarticlesUnicode.html relnofollowhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comarticlesUnicode.htmla ...but it didnt really explain why I was seeing what I saw, unless in C, the reader starts cutting off bits when it hits weird characters like that.

Negative 77851 pI have a file which needs to be parsed. Although the problem is semmingly simple i am not getting any headway.

Negative 77851 pIm building a system that allows an organisations members to refer newsletters they receive to their friends or family.

Negative 77851 pIm a newbie to iOS development and working on my first app for the iPhone and later wanted to convert it to iPad making it a universal app. I have couple of questions thoughp  pa. Is it better to begin with universal or it shouldnt matter. How difficult is it to convert to a universal app. For testing, I tried to add a new View controller both for iPhone and iPad on xode 4.2 and it looks like selecting Targeted for iPad doesnt include iPhone specific view controllers and unchecking it doesnt include one for iPad. How would I add support for both the devices if I wanted to go thru the universal route from scratchp  pb. Im targeting iOS 4 and above and also all revisions of iPhone including 5 and iPad including mini. I have couple of png files in the app that Im using for buttons and also for the other Apple required png files. I couldnt find documentation for what needs to be done when supporting iPhone 5 since it has a 4 inch screen. Also, do the images have be done separately for iPad too as the screen real estate is bigger. Can somebody please explain or point me to some links that educate me on thisp  pc. Im not using Storyboards but wanted to use ARC. Is ARC supported also on devices that are running on iOS 4.0p  pd.

However, I want to make sure that they work OK for logs that overlap the change from standard time and daylight savings time or if I get logs from other timezones.

I found the noteIt is strongly recommended that you do not rely on these names for anything other than display. These names are not official, and many of them are simply the invention of the Olson database maintainers. Moreover, these names are not unique. For example, there is an EST at both 0500 and 10001100.  and elsewhere The short names for time zones are not unique, and so any attempt to determine the actual time zone from such a name involves guessing. Use the long names instead.p  pI have no control over the timezone display I am given, so I dont know what to do now. If I use PST8PDT or AmericaLosAngeles, how do I indicate whether the given time is standard or daylight savings And is there a conversion for the timezones in the US to timezones that DateTime will accept Can someone please help me figure this out My seemingly trivial project of merging log files is taking forever and my boss thinks Im an idiot. p

Negative 77851 pIm writing a noninvasive conservative GC in C and Im having some concerns about the correctness of its stack scanning phase.p  pSpecifically, with no compiler optimizations enabled, it works fine because every local variable which points to an object is predictably allocated on the stack. In codeO3code, the GC misses some valid references, which I believe is due to the fact that the compiler opts to use registers instead of the stack, which the GC scans for some variables and function argument passing and the GC isnt yet programmed to handle that. If you suspect that this still shouldnt be happening and that Im misreading the source of the problem, please let me know.p  pApart from some rudimentary requirements having to use a codeGCmalloccode instead of codemalloccode for GC objects, not pointing to the GC heap from the nonGC heap and, of course, not explicitly calling codefreecode, the GC shouldnt have any more requirements from the client code or the compiler. Therefore, requiring any additional special patterns from the client code is not an option. Similarly, forcing programs that use this GC to be compiled with special compiler flags that suppress stack optimizations should be a last resort option, at best. With these two out of the way, heres the buildup to my question.p  pIm trying to find a way to make the GC handle the codeO3code case with the stack optimizations seamlessly. Heres my train of thoughts assumptions, more preciselyp  ol liNo matter how far GCC or any valid compiler goes with the optimizations, it wouldnt go so far that it would compromise the correctness of the program. li liIf [1] holds, I believe that at least in practical implementations of C if stronga reachablestrong allocated as local at any call level strongvariablestrong is going to remain accessible at all, it stronghas to be either on the stack or in the current register setstrong, but not really anywhere else. li liIf [2] holds, it emshouldem mean that simply dumping all the registers to the stack when the GC cycle starts would guarantee that a subsequent stack scanning would now find the previously missed references as well.li liAdditionally, if [1] and [2] hold, then if the compiler lets any variables be overwritten in the case of registerbased ones, mostly, it means that it has performed some level of code analysis and it has proved that that variable isnt used anywhere else in that function. So, in that sense, if we dont see a variable in the stack or in the register dump, even though its still in scope theoretically, this shouldnt be a cause for alarm for me because the compiler has simply sort of helped out the GC by getting rid of a dead reference.li ol  pstrongQuestion 1strong Are emallem 4 of my assumptions correctp  pstrongQuestion 2strong What is the most portable way to force a register dump Ive found some sources claiming that a simple codesetjmpcode call will have this effect.

Negative 77851 pIm developing an ios app which will invoke a web service operation.  The existing web service is configured with wsHttpBinding security set as TransportWithMessageCredential.  p  pIve used wsdl2objc to generate the implementation files from wsdl and have setup a small app for testing purposes.  Im not able to get the app to talk to the web service correctly though, and from what Ive read it seems virtually impossible with these web config settings wsHttpBinding, Transport and Message security.  p  pIve done quite a bit of research, and with the help of information found on this site and others, Ive managed to find out what SOAP requests should look like.  I basically used WCF Test Client with Fiddler monitoring the traffic.  I also tried soapUI, which wasnt as successful as Id hoped.p  pI did setup a test web service locally and I can successfully consume, but only when the web config has security using BasicHttpBinding or wsHttpBinding security mode  none which I understand is just like basicHttpBinding. p  pMy solution I hope is...what if I write a web service to call this web service  Both web services will reside on the server, but the one the iphone will consume is configured with SSL.  The idea is then to manually encrypt the operation and necessary attributes using an ios security framework HMAC or other hashing algorythm, and have the SSL web service decrypt and then invoke the requested operation from the existing web service.  Does this make sense  Im thinking this seems too simple, that I must be missing something.  Does anyone see any real problem with thisp  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrong I just wanted to clarify my situation a little My app is not able to consume  the existing web service as it is configured.  My thought was to create a web service which will talk with this one.  The new web service will simply decrypt the incoming data and invoke a method on the existing web service.  Once a response is received, the new web service will encrypt the data and send it back to the iphone app.  Sorry if Im not being clear.  p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHere is the soap envelope from Fiddlerp  pcode     ltsEnvelope xmlnsshttpwww.w3.org200305soapenvelope      xmlnsahttpwww.w3.org200508addressing xmlnsuhttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecurityutility1.0.xsdgt codep  precodeltsHeadergt     ltaAction smustUnderstand1gthttptempuri.orgIServiceValidateMeltaActiongt     ltaMessageIDgturnuuid81d7039353564e3ab20949ea53068935ltaMessageIDgt     ltaReplyTogt         ltaAddressgthttpwww.w3.org200508addressinganonymousltaAddressgt     ltaReplyTogt     ltaTo smustUnderstand1gthttpsmibe.stpa.comWCFServiceIVService.svcValidationServiceltaTogt     ltoSecurity xmlnsohttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecuritysecext1.0.xsd smustUnderstand1gt         ltuTimestamp uId0gt             ltuCreatedgt20130210T044818.646ZltuCreatedgt             ltuExpiresgt20130210T045318.646ZltuExpiresgt         ltuTimestampgt         ltcSecurityContextToken xmlnschttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502sc uIduuid0191ec20905d4ef0a8183eced0e02ecf32gt             ltcIdentifiergturnuuid06bd1d3e97e541bcafce3993736f202dltcIdentifiergt         ltcSecurityContextTokengt         ltSignature xmlnshttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsiggt             ltSignedInfogt                 ltCanonicalizationMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200110xmlexcc14ngt                 ltSignatureMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsighmacsha1gt                 ltReference URI0gt                     ltTransformsgt                         ltTransform Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200110xmlexcc14ngt                     ltTransformsgt                     ltDigestMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsigsha1gt                     ltDigestValuegtRpEprwYbnSypHXVFrdxn3nkRoltDigestValuegt                 ltReferencegt             ltSignedInfogt             ltSignatureValuegtya8hHooO129dNOHplhY3xRndoDkltSignatureValuegt             ltKeyInfogt                 ltoSecurityTokenReferencegt                     ltoReference ValueTypehttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502scsct URIuuid0191ec20905d4ef0a8183eced0e02ecf32gt                 ltoSecurityTokenReferencegt             ltKeyInfogt         ltSignaturegt     ltoSecuritygt ltsHeadergt ltsBodygt     ltValidateMe xmlnshttptempuri.orggt         ltmemberIdgt950470173ltmemberIdgt     ltValidateMegt ltsBodygt codepre  pcodeltsEnvelopegt codep

Negative 77851 pThe best iOS keyboard for entering USD currency values pictured below includes numbers 09, the decimal symbol, the comma symbol, and the dollar sign. As far as I know, the only way to emgetem this keyboard on Mobile Safari is to use codeltinput typenumbergtcode.p  pUnfortunately, iOS currently has builtin validation for the codenumbercode input type which screens out commas and dollar symbols. Since this validation feature is embedded in the browser and Mobile Safari hasnt yet implemented the codenovalidatecode directive, there is currently no way to do this validation manually.p  pUsing codeltinput typetextgtcode would obviously solve the validation problem, but it also would bring up the regular alpha keyboard, which is not acceptable for my current project a financial calculator.p  pIm on the verge of doing something crazy, like using JavaScript to quickly switch the codetypecode from codenumbercode to codetextcode after the codeinputcode receives focus.

Negative 77851 pDear stack overflowers,p  pI am not sure if this is the best place for this question, but I figured Id give it a shot.p  pI am currently working on an API that will allow consumers to readwrite data about users. i.e. codenamecode, codeemailscode, codephoneNumberscode, etc. And, as you could guess by the title, I am also storing codeimscode. p  pSince users may contain multiple codeimcode addresses that belong to different services e.g. skype, google talk, AIM, etc., there is a codetypecode attribute associated with each codeimcode address.p  pI am at the point where I am attempting to validate the user attributes, and when I arrived to codeimscode I was unable to find a formal specification, or normative document that dictates how these should be formattedvalidated.p  pMy question is the following p  pIs there a general format that codeimcode URIs followp  pnoteI have stumbled upon a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmldraftietfimppsrv04page4 relnofollow titleRFC 3861RFC 3861a that touches on codeimcode addresses.

Negative 77851 pI have a table called codeeventscode where all new information goes. This table works as a reference for all queries for news feeds so event items are selected from there and information corresponding to that event is retrieved from the correct tables. p  pNow, heres my problem. I have codeEIDcodes in the events table which correspond to the ID of an event in a different table, be it codeTIDcode for codetrackscode, codeSIDcode for codestatuscode and so on... These IDs could be the same so for the time being I just used a different autoincrement value for each table so codestatuscode started on 500 codetrackscode on 0 etc. Obviously, I dont want to do that as I have no idea yet of which table is going to have the most data in it. I would assume codestatuscode would quickly exceed codetrackscode.p  pThe information is inserted into the codeeventcode table with triggers. Heres an example of one p  precodeBEGIN INSERT INTO events action, EID, ID VALUES has some news., NEW.SID, NEW.ID END codepre  pThat ones for he status table. p  pIs there an addition to that trigger I can make to ensure the codeNEW.SIDcode  an codeEIDcode currently in codeeventscode and if it does change the codeSIDcode accordingly. p  pAlternatively, is there some kind of key I can use to reference events when auto incrementing the codeSIDcode so that the codeSIDcode is not incremented to a value of codeEIDcode. p  pThose are my thoughts, I think the latter solution would be better but I doubt it is possible or it is but would require another reference table and would be too complex. p

Negative 77851 pI am creating a little function that will display a notice when a certain condition is met, so if the condition returns true, it appends a div element with a notice to elements with a set class, however, is not working properly in chrome, it only appends the notices as long as there are less than 3 elements. I tested it in Mozilla and Opera and works well.p  psomething like the followingp  precodeif jQuery.notice iframehidden.length  jQuery.notice.appendltdiv classmessagegtHello Worldltdivgt  codepre  ppage HTML samplep  precodeltdiv classnoticegtltiframegtcontentltiframegtltdivgt ltdiv classnoticegtltiframegtcontentltiframegtltdivgt ltdiv classnoticegtltiframegtcontentltiframegtltdivgt ltdiv classnoticegtltiframegtcontentltiframegtltdivgt ltdiv classnoticegtltiframegtcontentltiframegtltdivgt codepre  pWhat the jQuery code does is check if the iframe element is hidden, if it is then it appends the div with hello world message to each element that has the class notice.p  pNow the issue here is that it doesnt work properly in Chrome, it only works as long as there are only 3 elements only.p

Negative 77851 pHi everyone and thanks in advance for reading this first stackoverflow post..yaay p  pIm trying to send a POST request with a JSON payload and a cookie containing authentification information to a REST webservice.

The server works fine with requests sent via curl or this a hrefhttpscode.google.comprestclient relnofollowJava RESTClienta by WizTools.orgp  pWhen looking at the Packet that was sent I noticed that strongthe amount of bytes that are ignored when reading the inputStream is the same amount of data as the description of the accepted Cookies i.e. Cookie2 Version1rnstrongp  pSo what is probably happening is that the requests contentlength is correct for the JSONdata 27 Bytes, but because the inputStream includes the Cookie2 Version1rn 23 bytes only 4 bytes of the JSON String get read before

This JPanel has 2 tables for some reasons, i prefeer to have just one JScrollPanes for both the tables.p  pThe problem is that i should ALWAYS show the two tables headers, and to do this i have to set a proper custom column header for the JScrollPanel.

The final JScrollPanels custom colum header must contain both the table headers, one one the left and the other on the right side visually making a unique headerp  pThank youp
Negative 77851 pI am looking to write a data structure to represent some genetic data. This data can be represented as a list of size codencode, where each entry also has a genetic position which is a real number between 0 and 1. To make nomenclature clear, Ill call the position in the list codeidcode and the genetic position codegposcode. The way I implemented this is as a class with p  precodeclass Coordsobject      def initself, args, kwargs         self.f  listargs, kwargs         self.r  dict         for i,e in enumerateself.f             self.r[e]  i      def setitemself,x,y         self.f.setitemx,y         self.r.setitemy,x      def getitemself,x         return self.f.getitemx      def lenself         return self.f.len codepre  pnow, I have two issues with this. The first one is that the indeces of self.r are floats, which is obviously a bad idea. I was thinking of converting them to strings with a fixed number of digits, but is there a better idea The other issue I have is that I want to implement accessing entries via codegposcode, so if I, for example, would like to access everything between codegposcode 0.2 and 0.4, I would like to be able to do that usingp  precodeimport numpy as np Coordsnp.arange1,0,.1 c.r[0.20.4] codepre  pis there an easy way to define that I was thinking of finding the correct codeidcode of the starting and ending positions using binary search and then access codeself.fcode using these ids, but is there a way to implement above syntaxp

Negative 77851 pI have been tasked with updating the companies outdated build process. It is all done in batch and perl scripts. The current build process isp  ol liSchedule a build through a web interface.li liBuild server takes the build process off the queue.li liBuild server checks out all of the files from the TFS source control.li liBuild server runs a couple of code injection scripts that modify the source before the build.li liBuild server updates versions and signs the code.li liBuild server uses visual studio to compile the projects. li liAfter that is finished the build server zips up the output and drops it in a network share location.li ol  pThe real difficult part is the code injection scripts. They are 3 perl scripts that modify a lot of code. They are also very machine dependent in the way they were designed. So I cant just drop them in the build process without a lot of modification p  pMy end goal is to be able to run the build process on local dev machines and also have CI running on the TFS server. p  pIn my searching it seems that there is no way to emulate a TFS Build on a local machine. So is my only option to use prepostbuild command line scripts in my cs.proj files Or is there a better way to do complex builds on the local machine and run the same builds on the TFSp  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9976987usingtfsbuilddefinitionsonalocalmachineUsing TFS build definitions on a local machinea, but that seems a bit hacky to me. I guess it wouldnt be a horrible solution if there isnt a better one.p

In this case the query execution plan is doing an index scan, but with many users querying the database, i am having the same problem.p

Negative 77851 pWe are using Probuf on a .netcf target.  Everything works well.  I started out using the static [ProtoContract], [ProtoMember, 1].. etc.  My colleage was concerned about adding potential overhead to the class object so I switched to a runtime model with .add ,   which seemed more disconnected from the class in question.  I actually prefer the static tags in the class since names are inherently updated if variable names are refactored later.  Since I do not know how or what protobuf does under the hood, is there any advantage or disadvantage to using the static tags vs. the runtime model in terms of overhead, speed, etc.p  pThanksp

Negative 77851 pI am new to DirectShow. I, like many others, am trying to create a socketbased P2P streaming solution for a WPFbased card game. I want each player to be able to see each other via small video windows.p  pMy questions are twofold. The first is How do I lower the frame sample rate and resolution I believe 320x200 x 15 to 20 fps should be fine. I am using the SampleGrabber callback to grab frame data and send it over the socket which is actually working with no compression at 640x480 resolution.p  pMy second question is, since each frame contains 921,600 bytes, this really bogs down and I get very slow rendering just across my local WiFi connected LAN. I added a simple MJPEG compression wanting to switch to h.264 later and I noticed the bytes drop to around 330360k. Not a bad improvement.p  pOn the receiving end Do I need to create a custom DirectShow Source Pin in order to serve up the bytes received from the socket so I can attach a decoder and render the bytes in a windowp  pI just wanted to ask this first since it seems like a lot of work to create a new COM object havent done that in about 15 years, register it, and usedebug it.p  pIs there perhaps another wayp  pAlso if that is the way to go, should I use a SampleGrabber on the receiving end and create a BitmapSource from the decompressed bytes, or should I allow DirectShow to create a child window Thing is, I want to have more than one other player and I set an extra byte in the socket to tell what table position they are in. How do I render each position in turnp

Negative 77851 pI am developing an application based firewall that intercepts outgoing internet requests launched by apps to inform the user what external servers and ports are trying to be accessed from his device from these apps. This security feature will ultimately protect the user from malware that steals personal data.p  pI am using the Linux Security Modules LSM framework to be able to intercept internet socket requests at kernel level in order to allow or deny the connection. This request is sent to the user through unix domain sockets. Theres an application that acts as deamon, waiting for request alerts unix domain socket server, that displays the request info to the user. This decides to either accept or reject the connection and this choice is sent back to the hook function LSM.p  pUnfortunately, the user is forced to install a new kernel to use this feature, because LSM hook functions are installed at compile time not as a kernel module anymore.p  pIs there any other way to operate with internet sockets in order to allow or deny connectionsp

Negative 77851 pGarbage collected object oriented programming languages reclaim unused memory automatically, but all other kinds of resources i.e. files, sockets... still require manual release since finalizers cannot be trusted to run in time or at all.p  pTherefore such resource objects usually provide some kind of emcloseem or emdisposeemmethodpattern, which can be problematic for a number of reasonsp  ul liemDisposeem has to be called manually which may pose problems in cases when it is not clear when the resource has to be released similar problem as with manual memory managementli liThe disposablepattern is somewhat viral, since each class containing a emdisposableem resource must be made emdisposableem as well in order to guarantee correct resource cleanupli liAn addition of a emdisposableem member to a class, requiring the class to become emdisposableem as well, changes the interface and the usage patterns of the class, thus breaking encapsulationli liThe disposablepattern creates problems with inheritance, i.e. when a derived class is emdisposableem, while the base class isntli ul  pSo, are there any alternative conceptsapproaches for properly releasing such resources Any papersresearch in that directionp

Negative 77851 pstrongPlease Note This question is not about lost keystore.strongp  pI signed an apk with a keystore and uploaded it as draft in Google playstore. Soon I realized that keystore was created with wrong information. Created a new keystore and signed the same apk again. Uploaded it again to playstore. Note that the apk was never published till now. After uploading for second time, published the app.p  pWhen I now try to upload an update, with new keystore, Google says fingerprint not matching. Sign with keystore that was used to sign the first version of appp  pQuestion strongWhy did Google not replace the keystore when I uploaded the app again signed with new keystore Is this a known issuebugstrong I have dropped a mail to Google support but would appreciate if anyone reply. Has anyone encountered the same problem Is there a fix for thisp

Negative 77851 pI have codeViewControllercode and codetableViewcode in it. When I add elements in codetableViewcode blank space above first column appears.

In codesize inspectorcode of codetableViewcode  codeScroll View Sizecode params are all 0. codeDelegatecode and codedata sourcecode are connected to codeViewControllercode.

Negative 77851 pAs part of my course, I have to learn C using Turbo C unfortunately.p  pOur teacher asked us to make a piece of code that counts the number of characters, words and sentences in a paragraph only using printf, getch and a while loop.. he doesnt want us to use any other commands yet.

Negative 77851 pIve been looking at Kevin Beasons path tracer smallpt a hrefhttpwww.kevinbeason.comsmallpt relnofollowhttpwww.kevinbeason.comsmallpta and have a question regarding the mirror reflection calculation line 62.p  pMy understanding of the rendering equation a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRenderingequation relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRenderingequationa is that to calculate the outgoing radiance for a differential area, you integrate the incoming radiance over each differential solid angle in a hemisphere above the differential area, weighted by the BRDF and a cosine factor, with the purpose of the cosine factor being to reduce the contribution to the differential irradiance landing on the area for incoming light at more grazing angles as light at these angles will be spread across a larger area, meaning that the differential area in question will receive less of this light.p  pBut in the smallpt code this cosine factor is not part of the calculation for mirror reflection on line 62. It is also omitted from the diffuse calculation, but I believe that to be because the diffuse ray is chosen with cosineweighted importance sampling, meaning that an explicit multiplication by the cosine factor is not needed.p  pMy question is why doesnt the mirror reflection calculation require the cosine factor If the incoming radiance is the same, but the angle of incidence becomes more grazing, then wont the irradiance landing on the differential area be decreased, regardless of whether diffuse or mirror reflection is being consideredp

Negative 77851 pI have a noncomputing device that needs to send a user of that device to a certain web page based on the current state of the device. The state consists of multiple keyvalue pairs that we encode into a URL e.g. codehttpexample.comdoMyStatusprop1val1ampprop2val2code. All told, this URL may reach 500 characters so we cannot expect the user to type it into her browser manually.p  pInstead, we plan on displaying a QR code with the URL that a user can visit with a smartphone. Due to this, we cannot submit this long URL as a POST request to the server although that would be the best approach.

Ive considered writing a custom URL shortener and having the device submit the URL for shortening before creating the QR code which is a lot more work storing short lived shortened URLs but probably the most practical solution.p

Negative 77851 pHello my first ever question on here, in need of bit of guidance. p  pIm working on a packet sniffer mainly to decode SNMP PDUs, however I am not entirely sure where to go with it.p  pSimply put my packet sniffer can extract information from packets however I am interested in the data payload field. It is written in C and I am using winsock.p  pWhat way should I go about this Are the SNMP fields encoded in basic encoding rules or will I have to delve into ASN.1 p  pI am only looking to decode those SNMP fields within the data payload field into human readable form. They are going to be dumped into a text file. So I will be looking at decoding OIDs also. I am verifying everything as I go along with Wireshark and using GETIF to query my SNMP node. p  pAny guidance is appreciated. p  pEDITp  pThanks user1793963 very well explained. Sorry to all who have marked this as too broad.p  pTo elaborate on my original question could anyone explain the initial part of the PDU itself.p  pExample My program outputs these hex values 30 82 strong00 A3strong 02 01 00, which is SEQUENCE 30, LENGTH 82 and two other values. This is from a GetRequest PDU.p  pThe GetResponse PDU shows these values 30 81 strongB7strong 02 01 00, SEQUENCE, 81 in LENGTH and another value.p  pstrongCould someone explain the values marked in bold. If it uses the simple TLV structure what are the values representing What I know is the start of the sequence 30 and the total PDU length which is 82 and 81 and I know 02 01 00 are INTEGER 1 in LENGTH and VERSION 0 however I do not understand 00 A3 GetRequest and B7 GetResponse. What do these values represent Many thanks.strongp  pemI am also using Wireshark to check values, however they do not state the start of the PDU sequenceemp

Ive put what is below in to a win form project, but codemyRect.Xcode, codemyRect.Ycode, etc. did not have anything in them.

Negative 77851 pI currently have a script that suggest a new url valid of my site when a user goes to a 404 page. The problem is that I have to manually add each suggested url that matches a common 404 page error. For example if the user types codewww.site.commoviethelasstmoviecode this should know it should be  codewww.site.commoviethelastestmoviecode, which currently works if I add the url into the database. The problem is that there are a lot of pages and the process to add 1 by 1 into the db would be massively time wasting.  The question is, is there a method to know a valid url after getting into a 404 error page that is the closest matching p  pPS the current script uses codelevenshteincode PHP function to compare a valid url retrieved from db with the current typed url that generated 404 error page and show the best matching url.p

Negative 77851 pSo, the title may seem vague, so Im going to describe it in more detail here. Im writing a spacethemed textbased game as a project, and Ive reached various problems. Im trying to use multiple files to simply everything, and so, say I have these variables in file 1p  precodeplayerhealth  100  o2  100 codepre  pAnd thats fine and it works and all, but in the first file I have, I have an evergrowing check function available so the player can see game info, so I made another file to handle loops. In the second file, I have this, for examplep  precodewhile True     if o2  0         time.sleep2         playerhealth  playerhealth 1 codepre  pand for the player,p  precode while True      if playerhealth  0      printgameover codepre  pRight now, o2 and playerhealth are set to 100 as variables. Gameover is a string I made, but that doesnt really matter currently. I defined o2 and playerhealth in file 1, say, and when I import file 2, they dont seem to work any more. Remember the While loops are handled in File 2. I could just put it all in one file, but then It would be harder for me to bugfix. The reason Im doing this is so that I can handle the start and the loops and the actual story part separately, and add or remove loops as I see fit without having to sift through tons of code, like I would probably have to if it was all in a single file.p  pTheres a lot of source code, So Ill just post snippets from file one and two. If you want to see all of the source code from both files, I could post it somehow, but there would be a lot.p  pstrongFile One Snippetsstrongp  precodeThis is at the beginning of file one, which is named VortexA o2  100 nitrogen  100 shipstore  [] playerinv  [] These Lists and variables handle levels of life support and storage. air  [o2, nitrogen] shipweapons  [] currency  5 power  0 He3   0  shiphealth  0 playerhealth  100 ship  False  This is at the end of file one.

Im trying to keep my game simple and easy to fix if something goes wrong by having separate files to handle loops and story.. If thats possible. If its not, Im going to have one hell of a messy file...p  pIm just going to have the first file handle a tutorialtype thing, the second handle loops, and the third handle gameplay elements.The way I want it set up is so that the variables are declared during a tutorial, and then the loops are in effect, and then I want the actual game to start. I feel like Im missing something really simple, or what Im trying to do is impossible. I strongly feel that its something to do with o2 and nitrogen being stored in the air list, but that doesnt really explain playerhealth not being able to work. If it wont work at all, Ill see if there is another way to do it, like putting it all in one file.p  pThanks in advance. Any and all help is appreciated.p

Negative 77851 pIm trying to write a test class for a class that has exactly one method.  Its not too difficult of a method, but it does require some my case two, through parameter objects from upper layers.  Problem is that in order to create those objects, other objects are needed and so on and so on.  So I decided to write two inner class which function as placeholder classes for the two parameters, containing only the information I need.  I set for these inner classes values for the attributes Id expect in fully working circumstances.p  pNow Eclipse doesnt let me compile because of the following errorp  pThe method produceTasksIOrder, List in the type AssemblyTaskFactory is not applicable for the arguments AssemblyTaskFactoryTest.IOrder, Listp  pAs you guessed, produceTasks is the method Im trying to test and the arguments are my inner classes.  The error thrown is pretty clear about it it wont accept my inner classes as valid parameters, despite having the same class names because its in fact a different class.  I expected this to work if I used the same class and method names.  Is there a workaround to make this work or what would be the alternative to avoid making a hundred objects just to test one methodp

Negative 77851 pMy ASP.NET MVC 5 application is using my local IIS Windows 7 which worked great until I had to start using the Microsoft.SqlServer.Types NuGet package. Because the package has native assemblies they have to be specialty loaded at runtime.p  pThe problem Im running into though is that after I rebuild the application and access it through the browser IIS loads and locks the native assemblies. If I make the change and rebuild again, Visual Studio fails and says the assemblies are locked by another process, IIS.

Negative 77851 pThe Pure programming language is a hrefhttpcode.google.comppurelangwikiRewritingapparently based on term rewritinga, instead of the lambdacalculus that traditionally underlies similarlooking languages.p  p...what qualitative, practical difference does this make In fact, what emisem the difference in the way that it evaluates expressionsp  pThe linked page provides a lot of examples of term rewriting embeing usefulem, but it doesnt actually describe emwhatem it does differently from function application, except that it has rather flexible pattern matching and pattern matching as it appears in Haskell and ML is nice, but not fundamental to the evaluation strategy. Values are matched against the left side of a definition and substituted into the right side  isnt this just beta reductionp  pThe matching of patterns, and substitution into output expressions, superficially looks a bit like codesyntaxrulescode to me or even the humble codedefinecode, but the main feature of that is obviously that it happens embeforeem rather than emduringem evaluation, whereas Pure is fully dynamic and there is no obvious phase separation in its evaluation system and in fact otherwise Lisp macro systems have always made a big noise about how they are emnotem different from function application. Being able to manipulate symbolic expression values is coolnall, but also seems like an artifact of the dynamic type system rather than something core to the evaluation strategy pretty sure you could overload operators in Scheme to work on symbolic values in fact a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550libsphoenixdochtmlindex.htmlyou can even do it in Ca with expression templates.p  pSo what is the mechanicaloperational difference between term rewriting as used by Pure and traditional function application, as the underlying model of evaluation, when substitution happens in bothp
Negative 77851 pI will explain my situation so that my question makes more sense.p  pI am programming a game using python and pygame. It is a pretty minimalist game without a lot of graphics, and I want each level to be a grid of either black or white squares. I think it makes a lot more sense to have each level be defined as a string of 1s and 0s like sop  precode0000 0101 1010 1111 codepre  pas opposed top  precodelevel1  pygame.Rect0, 0, 100, 100, pygame.Rect100, 0, 100, 100, pygame.rect200, 0, 100, 100, pygame.rect300, 0, 100, 100, ... ... codepre  pand so on and so forth for every single rect. The second way is clunky and awkward, and would make it very difficult to design the levels. Also in python, readability counts, and beautiful is better than ugly. p  pI am planning on using the first way, and having a function that returns a list of pygame.Rect objects similar to the code above where the 0s are black tiles, and the 1s are white tiles. Unfortunately though, pygame.Rect objects dont contain any data about what color they are.p  pNow my question is twofold.p  p1 Is it possible to add an attribute to an existing class In this example, adding the attribute rect.color without going into the source code of the module it came from and changing it yourself Becuase that seems like a REALLY bad idea.p  p2 If the above is possible, is it wise Or are you just shooting yourself in the footp  pUnderstand of course, I realize that this is not the only way to accomplish what I want. If I wanted to do it the tried and true way, I would create a class like sop  precodeclass tile     def initself, x, y, width, height, color         self.rect  pygame.Rectx, y, width, height         self.color  color      def drawself         pygame.draw.rectdisplaysurface, self.color, self.rect codepre  pThis is definitely the obvious way, and works for what I need just fine. But, I would like to know whether or not this is possible. If it is, it seems like it could be very useful in certain situations.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, I took shiplu.mokadd.ims advice and tried using setattr, but that only works with classes that I have defined myself, not imported classes. Here is an examplep  precodeclass pet     def initself, name, species         self.name  name         self.species  species  fido  petFido, Dog setattrfido, breed, Golden Retriever  print fido.breed codepre  pwhich outputs Golden Retriever as expected.

Negative 77851 pIm working on a responsive website. There is one type of navigation element that is an clickable image link. Ive got many of these on the page.  On a normal desktop computer when you mouseover this image it changes color  more, and changes back when you mouseout.  When clicked, you are linked to a new webpage.  Right now this is coded via a simple JavaScript Event handler. p  precodelta hrefhttpmyfakewebsite.comnextpage1.htmlgt        ltimg onmouseover this.src  image1red.png               onmouseout this.srcimage1normal.png          srcimage1normal.png        gt ltagt codepre  pThe issue is when a iPad user taps a clickable event, the following elements are sent.. mouseover, mousemove, mousedown, mouseup and click.  And that mouseover event is definitely causes me troubles. There is a fraction of a second where the image1normal image disappears and you get a visible icon white question mark in box with blue background and white border for a period of time before the site snaps to the new URL.  There is not enough time for the image1red to appear.  The whole affect looks odd. Its noticeable enough that my customer isnt happy.  Is there any way to mitigate this issue  Is there a way in JavaScript to say...p  pcodeif this is a mobile touch device, then skip the whole mouseover thingcode   p  pIs there a way to do this inline via Event Handler, or am i going to have to create event listeners for all of the elements in script en mass p  pSo I did an update to code p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, init, false      function init           var image1  document.getElementByIdimage1nav         var image2  document.getElementByIdimage2nav .. etc...           if ontouchstart in document.documentElement             image1.addEventListeneronmouseover, function                this.srcimage1red.png, false                   if ontouchstart in document.documentElement             alert Mobile device with Touchstart       ltscriptgt codepre  pThe alert test works fine on ipad not on desktop as expected.  p  pNow Im unable to get the onmouseover function to register...

Negative 77851 phere is an interesting question.p  pI have a navigation bar that looks like thisp  precodelt div id  mainnav gt lt ul gt lt li id  Tab1 gt Home lt  li gt lt li id  Tab2 gt Home1 lt  li gt lt li id  Tab3 gt Home2 lt  li gt lt li id  etc gt etc etc lt  li gt ... lt  ul gt lt  div gt codepre  pSo the mainnav has fixed width of 980px with overflow hidden and tabs are inline block. When the screen width decreased in size, the tabs are overflowing and are beyond the screen view, thous are hidden.p  pTo make it fun, I created a property to catch the last tab and see if it is overflowing, if it does, fire the event so the tab changes the from block to something else like responsive design.p  pHere is the codep  precode window .on resize, function resize    function resize  var pageWidth    mainnav .width var elementWidth    tab14 .width var elementLeft    tab14 .position.left  if  pageWidth   elementWidth  elementLeft  lt 0      ul gt li  .css   float left     else    ul gt li  .css   float      codepre  pThe problem The tabs starts flickering as it checks if tab14 is overflown and on refresh you need to resize window to get to that state. p  pThe question 1. Not related to the issue but, what is a good Jquery counter to find the number of the last tab automatically and fill in to the tab NUMBER.widthp  ol liTo avoid flickering, I tried the Timer, none worked. Do any of you know how to Save a Cookie of the Screen Width when the Tab event tab overflowing fired So I can fire the else event only after that screen width reached to return tab to its original shape.li ol  pYour input is very appreciated Thank you.p

And I eventually need to do this for all messages from all folders.p  pI have occasionally gotten the headers using the gmail api, but everything bogged down and the code below crashes my server WTF.p  pI am considering using Zend to get the headers and attachments because it supports oauth, but the getmessageid function of Zend does not use the id that the api gives needs and I havent found how to convert them.p  pAny help would be immensely appreciated.p  precodeltphp    Copyright 2011 Google Inc.

Negative 77851 pEDITp  pA colleague worked out what was wrong. It was because the codeasidecode element had codezindex 2code. Although it is fixed now, Im not sure why that codezindex 2code was causing these issues in the first place. If anybody knows why, Id like to know.p  hr  pIm having a rather odd issue on a website im working on. When on the architecture section, I click on one of the blocks to open the project, and it works. Almost. When one of the projects is open, the codeasidecode on the left does not scroll correctly. It distorts and splits up. Here is a screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrssMZ.jpg altArchitecture sectionp  pBut the odd thing is, the interiors section, which uses the same code, works fine. I have just recently finished recoding the news section with a new design and more features, so it could be something to do with that. But, so far, I have found no connection with other sections on the page.p  pThere are other errors on that specific page too. The Close button and next button hover events dont seem to be firing. However, if I open Dev tools and set the width of the close button to 29px, the hover event works, and the cross goes orange.p  pYou can access the site at a hrefhttpdev.guyhollaway.co.uk relnofollowhttpdev.guyhollaway.co.ukap  pIf anybody has any ideas, Id be very thankful.p  pThis happens on Google Chrome on both Windows and OS X.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 77851 pOkay, once again this is for a school project for which I am not allowed to use java bc idk, it is too advanced and would actually make this a lot more fun... So basically I have this rectangle inside this gigantic massive svg file. Now I want this rectangle to change size when I hover over it. I know there is a way with getbox to determine the center and make it bigger when you hover over it. since getbox is java I cant use it.  So I thought Id put two rectangles on top of each other, one slightly bigger than the other, set the biggers opacity to 0 and then put a style over it that says that the bigger ones opacity changes to 1 when I hover over it, so that it looks like the rectangle is changing size when really it just switches from one rectangle to the other. Only problem is it doesnt work. Now I dont know if it doesnt work bc you cannot put two rectangles on top of each other or if it doesnt work bc it is just plain wrong. p  precode    ltg      inkscapegroupmodelayer      idlayer12      inkscapelabelHobitton Cityicon      styledisplayinline      sodipodiinsensitivetrue      transformtranslate0,4.0044824gt     ltstyle typetextcssgt  lt[CDATA[         rect10023hover opacity 1important          ]]gt       ltstylegt      lta xlinkhref onclickwindow.openprint.html, newwindow, width300, height250 return falsegt     ltrect        stylefill8f1212fillopacity0stroke000000strokewidth0strokelinecaproundstrokelinejoinroundstrokemiterlimit4strokeopacity1strokedasharraynonestrokedashoffset0        idrect10023        width15        height15        x266.97247        y201.43393 gt      ltrect        stylefill000000fillopacity1stroke000000strokewidth0strokelinecaproundstrokelinejoinroundstrokemiterlimit4strokeopacity1strokedasharraynonestrokedashoffset0        idrect10023b        width8.2568808        height6.880734        x266.97247        y201.43393 gtltanimate attributeNamefill begin2s dur2s valuesblack660000 fillfreeze gt     ltrectgtltagt  etc codepre

Right now we just copy each backend database via ftp and store it as usrbackenddbdate.accdb Back end databases contain around 16 tables with most of them containing a autonumber field as a primary key. Further tables are connected with each other referencing the primary key as a foreign key .I would like ideally create a function in vba that lets me select the database and merge all the data from that database to a identical central database. For the initial part, I am thinking of doing something like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15042007howtomergetwoidenticaldatabasedatatooneHow to merge two identical database data to onea with possibly trying to cascade the change in autonumber feild so the refrences remain intact.  I wanted to know if this approach is doable or if any one has any other ideas and suggestion that I can look into. Constant Access to one back end db via internet is not really possible as the users are able to connect to internet network once a day only.p
Negative 77851 pI have a codeRecyclerViewcode populated with codeCardViewcodes. In the codeonLongClickcode method of the codeCardViewcodes, I open a dialog with the option to delete that card, but Im running into problems with the app crashing. If I have multiple cards and delete them one at a time, it will sometimes throw codeIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionscode or codeCursorIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionscode when I try to delete more than one in a row. p  pIts important to note that if I delete one, leave that activity and then return, everything will be fine when I try to delete another. Is this because the adapter is being replaced with a new one p  pIm not sure how to fix the problem. Any advice is appreciated.

Negative 77851 pWe had to implement an ASM program for multiplying sparse matrices in the coordinate scheme format COOS as well as in the compressed row format CSR. Now that we have implemented all these algorithms we want to know how much more performant they are in contrast to the usual matrix multiplication.

Negative 77851 pI have migrated all my image files to the asset catalogue. All of them are pdf vectors of size 1x. They are set to render as a Template. They show up fine everywhere in size and in color. But there is this one custom TableView Cell from a xib that I has 6 UIImageView s linking to 6 of these images from the catalogue. Somehow they dont respect the tint color, neither default nor custom. Tried changing them programmatically but didnt work either. These same images show up fine in another tableview with static cells inside the main storyboard. I am not able to isolate the issue. Interestingly, the tint shows up perfectly fine once the cell is selected and the selection is changed. Then it tends to show the tint as set in IB. Seems to be like a bug to me in xcode.

Negative 77851 pI have a table which contains loans. These loans come from different stores, the stores are in different states.p  pThere is a state requirement that each store location must have a unique numeric code for the loan and that the sequence must not have any gaps. Since this data is in a consolidated table, I was looking for a way to assign a specific sequence for each store. The contents of the sequence may be duplicated across stores, that is, store 10 may have a sequence value of 10 for a transaction as well as store 15. p  pI know that I could use a trigger after insert to look for the last number used for a store and increment it by one, but was looking for something a bit more elegant and error resistant to accomplish thisp

Negative 77851 pOk so I was watching a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvu2okVLCrqgEampt2h14m18s relnofollowa YouTube video about Angularjsa and on one of the lines of code, they were using two filters. It went something like thisp  precodeltdiv ngrepeatitem in event.events  orderBy date  limitTo 2 ...gt codepre  pMy only question is on the order of operations here. This question is NOT about the difference between sorting and then limiting the list of items versus limiting the items first and then sorting them. For further clarification, the question is more about stronghow angular implements this and whether it does any optimizationstrong, so one can decide how to use these filters more effectively. It seems that sorting a list of 100 and then cutting it down to two elements is extremely inefficient when you could maybe outside of angular or with a custom filter find the most recent items, but stop looking when you get to the number of items you want displayed. p  pIn angulars default behavior with the above code, is the entire list of events sorted by date before being cut down to two or does angular do some internal optimization to make this more efficient Or would one have to make a custom filter to achieve this optimization p

And in this we might need to call those databases 300 times, which may hit the performance..p  pPlease suggest what would be the best way to implement this Threading  or anything elsep  pConstraints   Service is hosted in iis  Built in .net 4.0  Using .asmx templatep  precode[WebMethod] public string GetKeystring parameter                 Fetches data from  database 1           Fetches data from database 2          Based on some calculation returns Key1          returns key1       codepre  pabove is existing logic now to get 300 different keys , I may need to call the above Web Method up to 300 times from client which would be a bigger performance issuep  por I may need to implement thread inside the Web Method but then there may be again performance issue due to worker thread of IIS.p  pPlease suggest how should I implement the Web Method so that it can minimum performance impact for generating up to 300 keys. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 77851 pCurrently we have multiple 10 webapps in Tomcat, each of them has to have its own log4j.xml configuration, because p  ul lieach webapp has a different file name for DailyRollingFileAppender li lithere are often 23 appenders infoerror log, audit, statisticsli lion top of may have unique logger level definitions to reduce certain chatty components.li ul  pThe growing challenge is that different parties, who use the logging, want different formats, rules and log levels p  ul lidevelopers want TRACE logging for everything, testers want INFO logging, sys admins for production deploys and so on want an ERROR level onlyli liboth developers and testers are happy with DailyRollingFileAppender, while sys admins want to use a logrotate insteadli lisys admins want to zip the logs, which is inconvenient for developers and testers.li ul  pSo the most obvious solution is of course to have log4j.xml in 3 variants log4j.xml.dev, log4j.xml.test, log4j.xml.prod for each webapp and redeploy the corresponding one somehow. Which looks like a nightmare to maintain or even setup.p  pAnother option to have some location outside of webapps where there will be 1 log4j.xml for all webapps, which is setup once for that environment and not redeployed every time. Seems better, but that big log4j.xml can get messy, and I didnt find any recommendations on whether this is generally a good approach or where the log4j.xml should be placed in such case.p  pSo if someone had a similar dilemma, how did you solve it if you used one of the approaches above, or if you have an idea for the entirely different approach  Id like to hear it. Thanks.p
Negative 77851 pIm fairly new to unit test in Python, but have done a few so I understand the basics of it.

Laravel is using redis to handle sessions. p  pI have plenty of tutorials on hooking up laravel with socket.io, its all pretty straight forward. I can connect, respond and forward messages back down the socket and to the laravel application.  p  pHowever every tutorial avoids the auth part of this setup. Once the message is received within the socket1234 space, how do I forward that message through to laravel while making sure that request is authed. p  pIdeally I would simply share the session, and verify the XSRF token. Because the two applications are on different ports, I cant pick up the session directly. p  pCurrently I am using an alternative approach, it involves the followingp  ul liUpon socket connection in node, I decrypt the cookie sent up on connection using nodes Crypto library and nodes PHPUnserialise library.li liThis gives me the laravel session id from the cookieli liI use this to access the redis laravel sessionli liI then decrypt that session, which in turn, gives me access to the user idli ul  pIt works, but I feel it could be potentially be a security hole, because I am not actually using token to verify the origin. p

Negative 77851 pIm a bit of a noob with MongoDB, so would appreciate some help with figuring out the best solutionformatstructure in storing some data.p  pBasically, the data that will be stored will be updated every second with a name,  value and timestamp for a certain meter reading.p  pFor example, one possibility is water level and temperature in a tank. The tank will have a name and then the level and temperature will be read and stored every second. Overall, there will be 100s of items i.e. tanks, each with millions of timestamped values.p  pFrom what Ive learnt so far and please correct me if Im wrong, there are a few options as how to structure the datap  ol liA slightly RDMS approachli ol  pThis would consist of two collections, Items and Valuesp  precodeItems        id  id,      name  name    Values        id  id,      itemid  itemid,      name  name,            temp or level etc     value  value,      timestamp  timestamp  codepre  ol start2 liThe more document db denormalized methodli ol  pThis method involves one collection of items each with an array of timestamped valuesp  precodeItems        id  id,      name  name     values  [          name  name,            temp or level etc         value  value,          timestamp  timestamp     ]  codepre  ol start3 liA collection for each itemli ol  pSave all the values in a collection named after that item.p  precodeItemName        id  id,      name  name,            temp or level etc     value  value,      timestamp  timestamp  codepre  pThe majority of read queries will be to retrieve the timestamped values for a specified time period of an item i.e. tank and display in a graph. And for this,  the first option makes more sense to me as I dont want to retrieve the millions of values when querying for a specific item. Is it even possible to query for values between specific timestamps for option 2p  pI will also need to query for a list of items, so maybe a combination of the first and third option with a collection for all the items and then a number of collections to store the values for each of those itemsp  pAny feedback on this is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 77851 pI want to give ids to multiple views created programmatically and each id to be a specific integer based on my own logic. Consider the following examplep  ol liI have M colors defined in a sequential way, e.g. using enum, or using an array to put M color values. Which implementationstructure to use is part of the puzzle and suggestions need to be provided for this as well, in order to achieve the final goal described below.li liCreate N instances of a custom Class and store them in a sequential way too e.g. an array of N elements. This custom Class will just have a member mColor where a color for the specific instance will be stored.li liCreate programmatically always N RadioGroups with M RadioButtons for each RadioGroup.li liThe goal is when user clicks the jth RadioButton of the ith RadioGroup, then the ith instance will use as background color the jth color.li ol  pSo, I would like to do something like this when OnCheckedChanged event occurs for a RadioGroupp  precodepublic void onCheckedChangedRadioGroup group, int checkedId      int i  group.getId     j variable is not actually needed here, but is used for concistency     with the description above.     int j  checkedId      assume for simplicity that an array of N elements is used to store     the N CustomCLass instances and an array of M elements is used for      colors     customClassArray[i].setmColorcolorsArray[j]   codepre  pFrom the above, I think it is necessary that specific ids for the programmatically created RadioGroups and RadioButtons need to be set. If there is a way for this to be done, then code will be clear, optimized and no switch statements will be needed for N RadioGroups and M RadioButtons for which, in any case, I have no clue about how it could be implemented too.p  pWhich is the best way to achieve this, firstly with efficiency in mind and secondly, with clear code in mindp  pThank you in advance for any suggestions.p  pstrongEditstrong For clarification, I have read about setting my own ids by using View.setId, but there are many resources on the web which are against this hardcoded approach and I also vote against this if there is another way and many of them suggest using xml resource to put your ids. However, as I said earlier, I think this is not what I want in order to achieve my goal. Example links suggesting this approach a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid75081 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid75081a or also  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8937380howtosetidofdynamiccreatedlayout89374778937477How to set Id of dynamic created layouta. Also, this approach is the suggested one in the android developer documentation a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesmoreresources.htmlId relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesmoreresources.htmlIdap  pLastly, I have also read this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5291726whatisthemainpurposeofsettaggettagmethodsofviewWhat is the main purpose of setTag getTag methods of Viewa which explains the purpose of Tags and the use of setTaggetTag methods. This may be the best approach Ive found so far for what I need. However, it surely introduces more complicated, unsupportable code. In any case, the right way, I think, has to be connected with ids, whose purpose is to uniquely identify views, rather than tags.p
