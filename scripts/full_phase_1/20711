Positive 20711 pIll be heading to some tutoring tomorrow, but Id like to see if I can get an explanation here. Tried to ask a friend from my class, but explanation didnt make sense.p  pIm supposed to take the users input in the form of a structure that holds day, month, and year.p  pHeres all I really have right nowp  precodeenum month          JAN  1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUNE, JUL, AUG, SEPT,         OCT, NOV, DEC   struct datet          unsigned short month         unsigned short day         unsigned short year   int mainvoid          datet date Allocates space for 3 unsigned shorts,         all for the date          printfPlease enter the month as an integer n         scanfhu          printfPlease enter the day as an integer n         scanfhu          printfPlease enter the year as an integer n         scanfhu          return 0  codepre  pSo, heres my issue.p  pI could write an absolutely massive 12x12 144 options switch statement for every single case of month  zodiac sign combination, but thats just insanity. I really dont know what to do here. p  pThe idea is if the user enteredp  precode8 month  28 day  12 year codepre  pMy program should outputp  precodeAugust 28th, 2012, Virgo codepre  pThe main issue is that we havent learned a way to store strings as a variable yet. Thats past what weve done.p  pSo I could make one switch statement with 12 cases one for each month and give each one a different printf statement starting with  Month d, d, date.day, date.yearp  pBut then how do I do the zodiac sign Also, thats 12 cases, that feels a little ridiculous.p  pMy teacher suggested something about converting to Julian dates, and I almost understand how, but it seems like Id need a really complicated for loop with a switch statement or a bunch of ifelses in there.p  pWhat in the world am I doing wrong What is the simpler solution p  pEDITp  pI managed to solve 23 of my problem. Now Im running into a different one.p  pI need to deal with leap years whatever that means and find their sign. Gah. p  pEDIT 2 Figured it out Wish I could show you all the code without making this post absolutely absurdly long. It works though Very happy Now I need to make a menu system for it. p
Positive 20711 pIm very new to PHP and Im developing in the context of WordPress with ACF. Im creating a custom layout builder, I got it working but I want to make my code simpler. Right now is code14 casescode which load a code.phpcode file if is applicable. Here is an example snippetp  precodeswitch getrowlayout       case row1          include templaterow1.php     break      case row2          include templaterow2.php     break      case row3          include templaterow3.php     break     codepre  pKeep in mind I have 14 total cases for now. They are named coderow1 gt row14code and the templates files are also named sequentially.p  pIs there any way of coding this without using so many switch cases What if I include another coderowcode in ACF and I want to avoid coding another switch case. p  pI was thinking a counter which counts the total codelayoutscode inside the codebuildercode and switch case loops through them. Does this makes sense I just want to make my code simpler and avoid the repetitiveness of the statements.  p  pThanksp

Positive 20711 pIs it possible to pass a variable to a switch statement, but conditionally An example is below.

I have all that but when a year put in such as 12311993 is put in, I get the day as 366 which is incorrect because its not a leap year so the day of the year should be 365.

Negative 20711 pI have implemented some tablepertype inheritance in my data model basically have a BaseEntity type with all the base information for my items and a Employer type that inherits from the BaseEntity item.  Everything appears to be set up correctly and when using the Entities either via ADO.net Data Services or via Linq to Entities I can see the Employer type and things appear to be fine.  The issue starts when I create a new Employer entity and attempt to save it.p  pOn the context that doesnt appear to be an .AddToEmployer item only and AddObject or AddToBaseEntity.  If I use AddObjectEmployer, NewEmployer I get and error message of The EntitySet name DataEntities.Employer could not be found. If I use AddToBaseEntityNewEmployer I get an error message of Unable to determine a valid ordering for dependent operations. Dependencies may exist due to foreign key constraints, model requirements orstore generated values.p  pHave I missed a step in setting up the inheritance  Is there some specific way to save objects that are inherited  What am I doing wrong  I assume that the basic issue is that I should have an AddToEmployer, what do I need to do to get that exposed.  It seems odd that it is not an option since I can see the Employer type on the client side and can do things such as var NewEmployer  new Employer  which seems to suggest that I can see the Employer type fine.p

Negative 20711 pI am using Python to read in data in a userunfriendly format and transform it into an easiertoread format.  The records I am outputting are usually going to be just a last name, first name, and room code.  Ip  pI would emlikeem to output a series of pages, each containing a contiguous subset of the total records, divided into multiple columns, each of which contains a contiguous subset of the total records on the page.  So in other words, youd read down the first column, move to the next column, move to the next column, etc., and then start over on the next page...p  pThe problem I am facing now is that for output formats, Im almost certainly limited to HTML and Javascript, CSS, etc.  What is the best way to get the data into this columnar format  If I knew for certain that the printable area of the paper would hold 20 records vertically and five horizontally, for instance, I could easily print tables of 5x20, but I dont know if theres a way to indicate a page break  and I dont know if theres any way to calculate programmatically how many records will fit on the page.p  pHow would you approach thisp  pstrongEDITstrong  The reason I said that I was limited in output  I have to produce the file on one computer, then bring it to a different computer upon which we cannot install new software and on which the selection of existing software is not optimal.  The file itself is only going to be used to make a physical printout which is what the end users will actually work with, but my time on the computer that I can print from is going to be limited, so I need to have the file all ready to go and print right away without a lot of tweaking.p  pRight now Ive managed to find a word processor that I can use on the target machine, so Im going to see if I can target a format that the word processor uses.p  pstrongEDITstrong  Once I knew there was a word processor I could use, I made a simple skeleton file with the settings that I wanted column and tab settings, monospaced font in a small point size, etc. and then measured how many characters I got per line of a column and how many lines I got per column.  Ive watched the runs pretty carefully to make sure that there werent some strange lines that somehow overflowed the charactersperline guideline which shouldnt happen with monospaced font, of course, but how many times do you end up having to figure out why that thing that shouldnt happen is happening anywaysp  pIf there hadnt been a word processor on the target machine that I could use, I probably would have looked at PDF as an output format.p

Negative 20711 pI have a quick and dirty proof of concept app that I wrote in C that reads high data rate multicast UDP packets from the network.  For various reasons the full implementation will be written in C and I am considering using boost asio.  The C version used a thread to receive the data using blocking reads.  I had some problems with dropped packets if the computer was heavily loaded generally with processing those packets in another thread.  p  pWhat I would like to know is if the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs15F385F0dochtmlboost5Fasioreferencebasic5Fdatagram5Fsocketasync5Freceive5Ffrom.html relnofollowasync reada operations in boost which use overlapped io in windows will help ensure that I receive the packets andor reduce the cpu time needed to receive the packets.  The single thread doing blocking reads is pretty straightforward, using the async reads seems like a step up in complexity, but I think it would be worth it if it provided higher performance or dropped fewer packets on a heavily loaded system.  Currently the data rate should be no higher than 60Mbs.  p

Negative 20711 pLets say I have a server program that can accept connections from 10 or more different clients.  The clients send data at random which is received by the server, but it is certain that at least one client will be sending data every update.  The server cannot wait for information to arrive because it has other processing to do.  Aside from using asynchronous sockets, I see two optionsp  ol lipMake all sockets nonblocking.  In a loop, call coderecvcode on each socket and allow it to fail with codeWSAEWOULDBLOCKcode if there is no data available and if I happen to get some data, then keep it.pli lipLeave the sockets as blocking.  Add all sockets to a codeFDSETcode and call codeselectcode.  If the return value is nonzero which it will be most of the time, loop through all the sockets to find the appropriate number of readable sockets with codeFDISSETcode and only call coderecvcode on the readable sockets.pli ol  pThe first option will create a lot more calls to the coderecvcode function.  The second method is a bigger pain from a programming perspective because of all the codeFDSETcode and codeFDISSETcode looping.p  pWhich method or another method is preferred  Is avoiding the overhead on letting coderecvcode fail on a nonblocking socket worth the hassle of calling codeselectcodep  pI think I understand both methods and I have tried both with success, but I dont know if one way is considered better or optimal.p

RToken token  ALLOCRToken   tokengttext  rbstrnew2some text   return DataWrapStruct..., ampfrttokenmark, ampfrttokenfree, token  codepre  pfrttokenmark calls rbgcmarktokentext   and  frttokenfree just frees the token with  freetokenp  pIn Ruby, this code correlates to the followingp  ptoken  input.nextp  pBasically, input is set to some object, calling the next method on it triggers the gettoken C call, which returns a token object.p  pIn Ruby land, I then do something like   w  token.text.scanwp  pWhen I run this code inside a while 1 loop to isolate my problem, at some point roughly when my ruby process mem footprint goes to 256MB, probably some GC threshold, Ruby dies with errors likep  pscan method called on terminated objectp  pOr just core dumps. My guess was that token.text was garbage collected.p  pI dont know enough about Ruby C extension to know what happens with DataWrapStruct returned objects. Seems to me the assignment in Ruby land, token , should create a reference to it.p  pMy workaroundfix is to create a Ruby instance variable in the object referred to by input, and stores the token text in there, to get an extra reference to it. So the C code looks likep  precodeRToken token  ALLOCRToken tokengttext  rbstrnew2tkgttext  added code prevent garbage collection  rbivarsetinput, idcurtoken, tokengttext return DataWrapStructcToken, ampfrttokenmark, ampfrttokenfree, token codepre  pSo now Ive created a curtoken in the input instance variable, and saved a copy of the text there... Ive taken care to removedelete this reference in the free callback of the class for input.p  pWith this code, it works in that I no longer get the terminated object  error.p  pThe fix seems to make sense to me  it keeps an extra ref in curtoken to the token.text string so an instance of token.text wont be removed until the next time input.next is called at which time a different token.text replaces the old value in curtoken.p  pMy question is why did it not work before Shouldnt DataWrapStructure return an object that, when assigned in Ruby land, has a valid reference and not be removed by Rubyp  pThanks.p

The client then sends multiple requests, perhaps codePOST er1batchAcode to update, then codePOST er1batchAapprovalcode to approve, then codePOST er1batchAstatuscode to end the batch.  On the backend, the server queues up all the batch requests somewhere, then processes them in the same backendtransaction when it receives the end batch processing request.  The downside with this is, obviously, that it introduces a lot of complexity.p  pSo, what is a good, general way to solve the problem of performing multiple actions in a single request  General because its easy to imagine additional actions that might be done in the same requestp  ol liSuppress or send notifications to email, chat, another system, whateverli liOverride some validation maximum cost, names of dinner attendeesli liTrigger backend workflow that doesnt have a representation in the document.li ol  pIts also an issue of performance.

Negative 20711 pI have an application in which Im doing some custom drawing, a bunch of lines on a gradient background, like so ignore the text, theyre just UILabelsp  pa hrefhttpprehensile.co.ukoutgoingScreenshot20100609at12.22.32.pnghttpprehensile.co.ukoutgoingScreenshot20100609at12.22.32.pngap  pAt the moment, thats all done by starting a new CGContext, drawing stuff into it with CGContextDrawLinearGradient and CGContextStrokePath, then finally saving the resulting image with UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext. The positioning info is calculated while Im laying out those labels, so itd be a PITA and duplication of effort to calculate it all over again when the containing UIView is drawn with drawRect, so Im drawing it ahead of time into a UIImage. All works fine, so far so good.p  pHowever, I have a sneaking suspicion that it may be more efficient to use CALayers to do this drawing. My cursory understanding of the difference between the two approaches is that a CALayer is more like a bunch of instructions to draw stuff, and so takes up less memory until its actually drawn onscreen, whereas drawing everything into a UIImage ahead of time means that youve got a sodding great bitmap kicking around in memory all the time, whether its drawn or not.p  pIs that a correct understanding What is generally considered to be the best way of drawing custom images on the iPhonep

In the second example, there is one client proxy per method and the client does not have worry about disposing the proxy.p  pIs reusing proxy between different method a good way to go Is there performance hit when you openclose WCF proxy In both examples, assume that ChannelFactory is cached and new channel is created every time via cachedfactory.CreateChannel method. p  pFor example, with the first wrapper I can do something likep  precodeusing Facade1 facade  new Facade1     facade.GetData    ...    ...    facade.GetMoreData  codepre  pIn the second example, I can just instantiate my facade and call the needed methods without worrying about disposing a proxy. p  pThanks in advance,p  pEricp

Negative 20711 pI have a silverlight navigation application, and I thought it would be no problem to add a page thats not part of the navigation app. What I would like to do is move the user from the application to a new fullscreen page where theres only a text covering the page saying, thanks for using....... click here to login again, and that will take the user back to my already implemented login page. p  pThe question is how can I implement a page thats not part of the user, then I guess all I need to do is navigationservice.navigate.. p  pThanksp

Negative 20711 pIm currently putting together a business app for an ipad. It will be talking to a Microsoft SQL server database. p  pMy question is what is the most efficient way to pull relational data over the line. One example is im showing a contact listing in the app. The contact record has a departmentID field which is related to the department table and a ContactTypeID field which is related to the ContactType table. I am hoping that when the user first starts the app I will pull the department and contacttype table data over onto the ipad. Than when i pull the contact listing data I will just pull the IDs for the fields over and pull their related data out of the data i pulled at startup. The user must than be able to click on a record in the listing and bring up the details page for the selected contact. This is a simple example but hopefully it makes my point.p  pHas anyone got any advice on the best approach for this I will be needing to both pull data and push data to and from the server.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 20711 pSo I have hosting that refuses to update to PHP 5.3 which is annoying but fine at the same time Im flexible, but the only thing that is really ticking me off is not having callStatic available.p  pI have modules loaded that Im wanting to consolidate down to a single class i.e. have a class that loads modules, and then accesses those modules functions through calls to the main class callStatic method, but when I uploaded from a local testing server to my server, obviously the callStatic method didnt work.p  pIs there an alternative that is emstillem static I like the clean code look for the double colon i.e. coderegistrysomefunccode instead of coderegistrygtsomefunccode.p  pAnother downside to this is that Im now forced to use the codeglobalcode keyword within functions which by my own preference is very, emveryem messy.p  pThe code was also extremely fast using static methods instead of nonstatic methods, and inturn much more clean.p  pstrongAlsostrong Ive thought about writing the callStatic method as usual with the 5.2 and then calling the methods explicitly, for example coderegistrycallStaticsomefunc, arrayval, val2, val3code and keeping things simpler that way, even being easier to migrate when they do upgrade to 5.3.

How should I refer to codeimgimage.gifcode if I include a link in each filebr The location of codeimage.gifcode changes relative to the location of the file that references it.br Using codeimgimage.gifcode in codesidebar.phpcode will work in codeindex.phpcode, but it fails for the file located at codecontentoverview.phpcode.br The only solution that I can see is to either include a separate codesidebar.phpcode in each subdirectory, or include an codeimgcode directory in every subdirectory.br The best suggestion that I can find is to use the codeltbasecode HTML tag as suggested herebr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions579565changerelativelinkpathsforincludedcontentinphp579746579746Change relative link paths for included content in PHPap  pHowever, in the same link, SamGoody suggests that the codeltbasecode tag strongcodeis no longer properly supported in Internet Explorer, since version 7.codestrong p  pId like some insight on the matter before committing to a course of action.p  pThanks.  p  pEDIT I am using the wrong approach below with code..code  p  pExample   p  prootindex.phpp  precode...   ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.css gt   lttitlegttitlelttitlegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt   ltphp includeincludeheader.php gt   ltphp includeincludemenu.php gt ...   codepre  prootincludeheader.phpp  precode...   ltdiv idheadergt   ltspan classflgtltimg srcimgdun1.pnggtltspangtltspan classfrgtltimg srcimgdun2.pnggtltspangt  ...   codepre  prootcontentoverview.phpp  precode...   ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss href..style.css mediascreen gt   lttitlegtOverviewlttitlegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt   ltphp include..includeheader.php gt ltphp include..includemenu.php gt ... codepre

Negative 20711 pI use ANT to run my JDO application example implemented using Datanucleus solution. When I run it I see a lot of INFO lines generated by Datanucleus. How can I get rid of them It takes a certain property setp  pProblem is that after initialization operations are over, appears a notification message and then wait to receive a response from the user. The first letter keys to enter first, do not reach the application, can not be read. Only after the first ENTER key the application is running as it should. And I think this behavior is caused by these INFO lines from Datanucleus, not sure.p  pExamplep  p[java] 19.01.2011 230258 org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.RDBMSStoreManager initialiseSchema [INFO Catalog AgendaEMail, Schema  initialised  managing 0 classes [java] Continue  YN Y Y [java] Add 1 [java] Edit 1p  pAs shown in this example I had to type the letter Y for 2 times to continue to next step, after the application was ready to start.

Negative 20711 pIm creating a web site that I think must have a client side database.  The other option would be to stick emeverythingem on the server at the expense of increased complexity and decreased scalability.  What options do I have  Must I build a plugin  Must I wait until everybodys HTML5 compliantp  hr  pemUpdateem Theres been a lot of comments about why I would actually need this.  Here are my thoughts.  Tell me if Im being sillyp  ul liThe clients will have a large and complex state that will require something like a database to provide the data interaction that I need.  Therefore I think cookies are out of the picture.  li liThis data is transient, so the client wont care if it gets erased as soon as they close a session.  However they will need to keep the data if they go to a different web page and then come back.  Therefore I think somehow storing the data in some sort of a javascript SQL implementation will not work.li liI can certainly do everything that I want to do on the server, and servers emcanem scale to manage the load Facebook.  emButem I think Id rather build a plugin than pay for the infrastructure to support this load.  This is for a bare bones startup.  The richer the startup is, the barer my bones will be.li ul

Negative 20711 pI have a TcpListener which waits for new socket connections. When a new connection is made, some other code services messages from the remote user. I periodically check for new connections and if a new one is made, the old one should be dropped.p  pPreviously Id just open the new connection which for the most part worked okay. Occasionally though, Id have problems reusing the same port so I figured it would be better to close that connection which I think should also give the old user an indication that the connection died.p  pThe code below is my attempt to do that, but for some reason the Disconnect call seems to block indefinitely.

Negative 20711 pI have a web.py app Im running through modwsgi locally httplocalhost....  Ive gotten to the point of adding authentication to my app and wanted to use web.pys builtin module.  I started with a brief example found here a hrefhttplog.liminastudio.comprogramminghowtouseopenidwithwebpy relnofollowhttplog.liminastudio.comprogramminghowtouseopenidwithwebpyap  precodeimport web, web.webopenid  urls       ropenid, web.webopenid.host,     r, Index   app  web.applicationurls, globals  class Index     def GETself         body           lthtmlgtltheadgtlttitlegtWeb.py OpenID Testlttitlegtltheadgt         ltbodygt             s         ltbodygt         lthtmlgt           web.webopenid.formopenid          return body  if name  main app.run codepre  pThis works well enough running in the terminal and going to a hrefhttplocalhost8080 relnofollowhttplocalhost8080a.  Another example a hrefhttpcfarrell.blogspot.com201011usrbinenvpythonimportwebfromweb.html relnofollowhttpcfarrell.blogspot.com201011usrbinenvpythonimportwebfromweb.htmla does a similar technique but makes more sense to me.  p  precodeusrbinenv python import web from web import webopenid urls   , index, openid, webopenid.host,   ... more code ...  class index   def GETself     oid  webopenid.status     if not oid       return please log in            webopenid.formopenid     else       return you are logged in as                 webopenid.formopenid codepre  pHeres where I get a little lost.  From what I can tell, the argument passed to codeformcode is the return URL after signing in.  For example, if I put httpwww.yahoo.com it will take me there after every login attempt.  I feel like this should point back to my own controller and just check there, but the convention seems to be to use the web.webopenid.host controller, which I guess handles the id and returns to the base  url.  I think Im getting there, but the status returned is always codeNonecode.  p  pFrom what I gather then, this is either a code issue, or theres something in my apache configuration that is keeping the authentication from working.  In web.webopenid, the library creates a .openidsecretkey file in the same directory as the web server.  When I run the example code, this gets created.  When I run my code through apache, it does not at least not in the cgibin.  Somewhere else  Anyway, if this file isnt being generated or being regenerated every time, it will keep me from logging in.  I believe its an apache issue as I tried running my app through the web.py webserver and I did get the file created and I can authenticate.  All I can conclude is this file isnt being written and every subsequent query tries a new file and I can never authentication.  Can any apachemodwsgi gurus explain to me where this file is being written or if this is the actual problem  p

Negative 20711 pI am running an asp.net codebehind that creates a string variable which holds a collection of floats separated by commas. Something like this in C p  precodestring myCString  4.5, 3.1, 6.5, 7.0, 1.3 codepre  pThis variable then makes it into the an asp.net web page where it is assigned to a JavaScript variablep  precodevar myJString  ltmyCString gt codepre  pNow we enter Highcharts where the syntax for a normal series looks like thisp  precodeseries [      name Series1,      data [1.1, 3.8, 5.3, 9.8, 5.0]        ] codepre  pWhat I would like to do is assign myJString to the data field of the series.  I have tried two approaches and both did not work.  The solution is probably trivial but I am far from even being an enthusiast programmer.  It looks like the core of the problem is that Highcharts expects an array of numbers rather than a string.  However, my understanding of the square brackets in JavaScript was that they convert whatever is within to a stringp  pHere is what did strongNOTstrong workp  precodeseries [      name Series1,      data myJString     does not work        ]  series [      name Series1,      data myJString  0     does not work either        ] codepre  pThe second try was from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3183584highchartsvariabledatacausesbrowserlockuphighcharts  variable data causes browser lockupa in retrospect it makes sense that it didnt work since subtracting 0 from a string that is not just a number falls short of the goal.p  pIt also makes sense that the first try didnt work since it seems to want an array of numbers rather than a string.  Now to my actual questionsp  pCan I inexpensively convert my string of comma separated floats in JavaScript so I can use it in the data field, and if so, how do I do that  Would it be better performance wise to do this in the codebehind and pass an array to JavaScript and then try the whole thing with an array This is assuming that the myJString not being an array of floats is the actual problem.p  pThanks in advance for any insight you may be able to provide.p

So, im going to offer a new cms that can really make the job easier for all who have to publish something on the website.p  pTo hit the point im looking for a web application that can realize and manage something like thisp  precodeIndex  Cap. 1    Par. 1.1      Sect. 1.1.1   Sect. 1.1.2   Sect. 1.1.3  Par. 1.2  Cap. 2    Par. 2.1  Par. 2.2 codepre  pAnd obviously manage the possibility to move an element and his son to another parent. etc. etc. but into a graphical UI not just an add son, add parent button. This product will go to people that probably barely knows the basic of M Words so i need something very very intuitive.p  pIm not looking for a readytogo application of course, i know this is a particular request but if someone knows about a project that at least arrange document in an hierarchical structure that would be a very good point to start. Im very strong in php and jsjquery code so if you find something in that languages that would be great, anyway any languages will be ok basic knowledge of java, asp, etc, i just need some more time maybe.p  pThe final goal would be the creation of an automatism that link the document toghether so you can navigate from sect. 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 and vice versa without have to manually write the html code for each web page, assign to every element a preassigned models, and other nice things to make everything very easy to manage even with large web document the medium document production is around 600800 paper pages.p  pI was thinking about some cms but seems that every one use the same old method to link document toghether field form for link, basic html code, etc that will be perfect for little document, like a tech rewiev for example, but not for huge document.p  pAll this words can be very hard to understand due my sleep deprivation for this project P So if something is not clear do not show mercy and tell me, ill gladly explain better as possible.p  pThanks in advance to anyone.p

Negative 20711 pI am having difficulty populating two TableViews with data from two different MutableArrays in one Class.

Negative 20711 pI am currently working on my first android app and first api for my organizations website.  I am attempting to connect to the api from the android app using a secure connection.  Our website has a test port on 8090 that I am attempting to use to test out the api but the problem I am running into is that I have a selfsigned certificate on the website which from what I have read online, android apps dont like.  To make sure there isnt a problem with the api, I have used it with an http rather than https connection and it works great.  I have tried a couple solutions I found online including a couple from this site but none seem to work.

Negative 20711 pA bit of an architectural question...p  pI originally created a Javascript singleton to house methods needed to operate a photo gallery module in a template file for a CMS system.  The original specification only called for one instance of this photo gallery module on a page.  The code below is a gross simplification of what I actually wrote.p  pShortly after releasing the code, it dawned on me that even though the specification called for one instance of this module, this code would fall apart if a page had two instances of the module i.e. the user adds two photo galleries to a page via the CMS.  Now, the HTML markup is safe, because I used class names, but how would I go about restructuring my Javascript and jQuery event listeners to be able to handle multiple modules  You may assume that each photo gallery has its own JSONP file or you may assume a single JSONP file if you think it can be handled more elegantly with one JSONP file.p  pI think my original jQuery event listeners might have to be converted to .delegate, but I have no clue what to do after that and what to do about converting my singleton.  Any leads would be appreciated.  If you offer code, I prefer readability over optimization.  p  pIm not asking this question, because I have an immediate need to solve the problem for work.  I am asking this question to be forwardthinking and to be a better Javascript developer, because I am expecting to run into this problem in the future and want to be prepared.p  pThank you for reading.p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classphotoGalleryModgt     ltdiv classphotoGalleryImgBoxgtltimg srchttpwww.test.orgiintro.jpg altIntro Photo gtltdivgt     ltdiv classphotoGalleryImgCapgtltpgtCaptionltpgtltdivgt     lta href classphotoGalleryPrevImgLnkgtltagt     lta href classphotoGalleryNextImgLnkgtltagt   ltdivgt codepre  pThe Javascript is an external static file and makes a call to a JSONP file via .getSCript, created by the CMS.p  pstrongJavascriptjQuerystrongp  precodefunction      photoGalleryModule           json ,         numSlidesInJson ,         currentSlide ,         updateSlide function argslidNum               Update the slide here          ,         init function argjsonObj              this.json  argjsonObj             this.numSlidesInJson  this.json.photoGallerySlides.length             this.currentSlide  0                    document.readyfunction          .getScript.photogallery.json          .photoGalleryPrevImgLnk.liveclick, functionevent              photoGalleryModule.currentSlide  photoGalleryModule.currentSlide  1             photoGalleryModule.updateSlidephotoGalleryModule.currentSlide             event.preventDefault                   .photoGalleryNextImgLnk.liveclick, functionevent              photoGalleryModule.currentSlide  photoGalleryModule.currentSlide  1             photoGalleryModule.updateSlidephotoGalleryModule.currentSlide             event.preventDefault               jQuery codepre  pstrongContents of photogallery.jsonstrongp  precodephotoGalleryModule.init      photoGallerySlides         [                              type intro,                 pageTitle Intro Photo,                 imgUrl httpwww.test.orgiintro.jpg,                 imgAltAttr Intro photo,                 captionText The intro photo,             ,                              type normal,                 pageTitle First Photo,                 imgUrl httpwww.test.orgiimg1.jpg,                 imgAltAttr First photo,                 captionText the first photo,             ,                              type normal,                 pageTitle Second Photo,                 imgUrl httpwww.test.orgiimg2.jpg,                 imgAltAttr Second photo,                 captionText the second photo,                      ]  codepre

Negative 20711 pI need a way to include an external XML file in PHP which does not use simplexml tags. Furthermore, Id also need it to integrate with other imported XMLs, hence removing file headers as codeltXML version...gtcodep  pBasically have a PHP class which includes methods to dynamically create XML elements based on userinput. For example, I could create a node called test, set id1 as attribute and add child nodes to it. What I basically need, is a way to extract further XML content from other files and have my PHP script recognize it, hence being able to call methods on this imported code. I tried using phps fopen function but, although it would print the imported XML to the screen, it would not validate and signal an error as soon as the imported code began. I cannot use simpleXML extension for two main reasons. Firstly, the entire class is written using PrePHP5 XML handling, and I cannot rewrite the whole thing from scratch as it is part of a teamproject, secondly, such class features methods which could not be replicated with simpleXML extension.p  pThis is the XML I generate codeltxml version1.0gt ltgagtltdsagthealtdsagtltsdagtehltsdagtltgagt ltgggtltdsgtheltdsgtltsdgtehltsdgtltgggtcode And it returns Illegal Content, Line 3 Column 1, highliting the lt of the gg tag...

I think this means that I need my column ULs to expand their height to match the tallest UL, or I need the columnContainer DIVs to expand their height to fill their parent which is surely controlled in height by the tallest child UL.p  pThe amount of content and the number of columns varies dynamically so I cant simply define minmax heights.p  pA sample version of my problem can be found at a hrefhttppastebin.comti5u41Ey relnofollowhttppastebin.comti5u41Eyap  pany and all help most welcomedp

Negative 20711 pIm trying to get a Java Client to communicate with a WCF wshttpbinding WebService. But Ive been unsucesful so far. The call either hangs, or I get SOAPFaultException The message could not be processed. This is most likely because the action httptempuri.orgISampleServiceGetServiceName is incorrect or because the message contains an invalid or expired security context token or because there is a mismatch between bindings. The security context token would be invalid if the service aborted the channel due to inactivity. To prevent the service from aborting idle sessions prematurely increase the Receive timeout on the service endpoints binding. p  pMy Web Service is just the default Visual Studio 2010 generated WCF Service Library Template.p  pMy java client is generated in netBeans 7.0.1 and stubs have been generated using new Other  Web Services  Web Service Client and Im referencing a local WSDL. p  pIve tried adding WebServiceFeature wsAddressing  new AddressingFeaturetrue  in the stub generated but it just throws the exception above.  p  pI see other people with similar problems however, I dont see any true resolution.

Negative 20711 pIt works... it doesnt crash, and it appears to do what I need.p  pThis could be a design flaw of my application but its the easiest way to do what I need. Basically a view is displayed and controls within the object itself determine when it is removed from the superview at which point it needs to be released.p  pAt this point its easiest to do code[self release]code, which appears to work.p  pHowever, Im aware of object ownership, and Im aware that instantiating an object which releases itself is not a good design of object ownership  ie the owner class the one which instantiates the new object should be the one which releases it. This would then, however, require me to write delegate methods calling back to the owner class, all just to release the object.p  pThoughts please p  pThanksp

Negative 20711 pIm using a custom role provider, which to over simplify gets a person object from the database using EF on .net 4 MVC project, and allocates user roles based on some rules around that and other queries.p  pThe data changes regularly, though changes are mode through code elsewhere in the system, not the roles provider.  The roles provider is one way, and simply gets the roles a user is in.p  pWhen I change the database values, the role manager does not pick up on the change of roles until I do a recompile by adding a space in web config for example, or the application otherwise restarts.p  pIve ensured the roles do not cache in a cookie by setting codecacheRolesInCookiefalsecode, which is what most help seems to point to, and presume there is a session cache built into the role manager.  p  pIve modified the EF query which returns the person object to include a time stamp as part of the query.  I can see through profiler the query is actually being called, and the time stamp changes each time, but my debug session shows stale data from the previous state for the person item.  There are other parts of the site that display data from the Person table, which show the up to date state.  p  pI dont really understand how the debugger should behave on cached data.  I dont see why the EF query would fire at all if its a cache issue, but the person data is definitely showing state as per the first run, not as per the current state of the table row.p  pI feel Im missing something obvious.  Does the Role Manager cache data in sessionp

Negative 20711 pI support different languages in my application and also allow the user to swap languages within the application itself. I noticed some problems a few weeks ago with users on version 7 of the SDK having the Hebrew language so I withdrew support for anything before version 8. I therefore stored the strings file in strongvalueshev8strong. However, when I swap to Hebrew on my tablet it doesnt change the language this works fine on my phone.

They are still leftaligned with their rank in the score tables, a full stop and then the name.

From there the UI components are generated that allow that table to be managed within the app. p  pThe problem of course is getting that new table in to the EF model without a recompile of the back end data service. p  pThe concept being that this builds the database and the pages required to manage the various parts of it theres a bigger picture in mind here but i dont want to confuse matters by trying to explain it all. p  pIm thinking that maybe EF is not the right tool to use at the moment .. because it needs a strongly typed set of entities in order to work ... that may not be possible in this case.p  pIm toying with the idea of passing this service Dynamic objects ... e.g. objects of type Something  dynamic p

Negative 20711 pI want to increase my integer primary key by 1 for every new entry in a specific table. I read that i could do that by using AUTOINCREMENT. On the other hand i found the note belowp  pNote that monotonically increasing does not imply that the ROWID always increases by exactly one. One is the usual increment. However, if an insert fails due to for example a uniqueness constraint, the ROWID of the failed insertion attempt might not be reused on subsequent inserts, resulting in gaps in the ROWID sequence. AUTOINCREMENT guarantees that automatically chosen ROWIDs will be increasing but not that they will be sequential.p  pSo my question is, shall i use autoincrement to keep counting my rows in the tablep

Negative 20711 pI always thought I could use SynchronizationContext to marshal a call to another thread.

Negative 20711 pI do some learning of using voip over udp in a small network. I know there are bundles of libraries ready to do and overdo everything I ever need with a few method calls, but as I said I am learning, so need to reinvent the wheel to see how it works.p  pI am currently investigating the DatagramPacket class and Ive noticed that there is no method that would set header informationie packet order sequence number which I need to know to do interleaving in DatagramPacket class.p  pA little code to reflect the environmentp  precodebyte[] block DatagramPacket packet  UDP packet                   x Bytes per block , y blocks per second,    z ms time block playback duration   block  recorder.getBlock  assume I have class that handles audio                                recording and returns speech in a                                uncompressed form of bytes  packet  new DatagramPacketblock, block.length, clientIP, PORT codepre  pFirstly, I assume that because it is UDP, the sender doesnt really care anything whatsoever besides the simple fact that he throws packets somewhere. So that is why there is no such method inside.p  pSecondly, I assume that I need to do it myself  add extra bytes to the byte block to be sent , which would contain a sequence number of a packet However am also concerned that if I do that, then how do I recognize if bytes are header bytes not audio bytes I can make assumption that first byte represents a number, however we know that byte can only represent 258 numbers. Ive never really worked on byte level before. Or there maybe other techniquesp  pShortly saying, to do interleaving I need to know how to strongset up packet sequence numberstrong as I cant order unordered packets  p  pThank You,p

Negative 20711 pstrongNotestrong I have found a solution to my problem so I am posting this for reference purposes, although I would be happy to be educated with a better solution.p  pIm trying to provide strongdouble clickstrong functionality on a Silverlight DataGrid by hooking into the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.uielement.mouseleftbuttondown28vvs.9529.aspx relnofollowUIElement.MouseLeftButtonDowna but when I subscribe to the DataGrid.MouseLeftButtonDown using XAML or the codeDataGrid.MouseLeftButtonDown code syntax, my event handler is not called when I click on the rows within the DataGrid.  If I click on the Header, the event is raised.p  pIf I subscribe to the same event at the parent strongUserControlstrong level, the event handler is called successfully as you would expect based on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc18901828vvs.9529.aspxroutedevents relnofollowSilverlight RoutedEventsa but then I have to detect whether the click occurred on the DataGrid or somewhere else.p  pIf I subscribe to the event using this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms59889928vvs.9529.aspx relnofollowUIElement.AddHandlera syntax, as shown below, then it works as expected based on the handledEventsToo true parameter.p  precodedataGrid.AddHandlerUIElement.MouseLeftButtonDownEvent,                      new MouseButtonEventHandlerdataGridMouseLeftButtonDown                     , handledEventsToo true codepre  pIt seems that the DataGrid implementation is marking these events as handled, prevent event bubbling, by default in one of the child UIElements, which is not what I expected initially. With more thought I can see that the click behaviour drives all sorts of things select item, edit field etc. so perhaps the implementation makes sense.p

Negative 20711 pI am developing a cross platform application using AndroidMonodroid, iPhoneMonoTouch, WP7 and Windows and would like to keep my code base as coherent as possible. The iPhone requires a Mac which is fine I can deal with that but Android allows development in Visual Studio which is great as I can manage three projects under the one solution.p  pNow adding an new android project to a new visual studio solution will allow me to deploy in the emulator just fine. Same goes with a new solution and new WP7 project and corresponding emulator.p  pThe issue I have is that if I setup a new solution with a WP7 project first and then add an new android project to the solution I cannot launch the android project as it always defaults to the WP7 emulator even when I set the android project to active project.p  pFrom what I can gather I think VS2010 will allow an emulator for the solution but will not allow an emulator per project within the solution. Has anyone come across this Is there a work around maybe via command line One workaround would be to have two visual studios open at the same time but I am trying to avoid that if possible.p  pstrongSource of the problem has been identified and solvedstrongp  pWithin the same solution dont give different project type executables the same name as this causes Visual studio a problem when determining which emulator to select.

Added various of my own features and designs and no problems running the project. p  pThen updated to ADT 17 2 days ago and this seriously messed things up for me. Started getting class path errors to name a few. I then reverted back to adt 16 which fixed the errors and my project compiles fine but as soon as i run it it crashes on the test device.p  pI have checked that my compliance level is correct, checked library paths, api versions, manifest xml, basically everything. I do not get how something that use to work perfectly can now just not work.p  pI proceeded to unistall everything and did a reinstall on the sdks ADT and java, but to no avail, even just trying to run the example project just crashes.p  pI have aslo uninstalled the app from the device and rbooted the device and cleared the cache.

Negative 20711 pLet me start off by saying I know how to use codeCausesValidationcode and codeValidationGroupcode. I have bizarre situation where I have an Ajax Tab container. Each tab has a gridview and the rows that generate in the gridviews all have a codeTemplateFieldcode containing an Add button. The buttons in the gridview and tab containers all use codeValidationGroupcode to prevent any cross contamination and all the Add buttons are set to codeCausesValidation  falsecodep  pI just added the last gridview and the Add button triggers all validators on the page. Once more the Add button is set as codeCausesValidation  falsecode so there is NO reason for it to behave in this fashion.

Negative 20711 pOk, for those in the know that are masters in Excel VBA, I have a pull down menu of companies that is populated by a list on another tab. Three columns, Company, Job , and Part Number. p  pWhat I have going on is that when a job is created I need a folder for said company to be created, and then a subfolder created based off of said Part Number.  So if you go down the path it would look like thisp  pcodeCImagesCompany NamePart Numbercodep  pNow if either company name or Part number exists dont create, or overwrite the old one. Just go to next step. So if both folders exist nothing happens, if one or both dont exist create as required. p  pDoes this make sense p  pIf someone can help me with understanding how this works and how to make it work it would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 20711 pI am developing an application where I have a section only for paid users where they purchase for the section using the inapp purhcase system in iOS. I know that I need to keep track of the purchase history myself, and this is where the problem begins. I have a database and I am capable of storing users in my database, with a web service interface. How can I create a system where a URL is pinged strongonlystrong when a user has made the purchase.p  pAs an example, I have the URLp  pa hrefhttpexample.comregisterUserPremiumuserid123456 relnofollowhttpexample.comregisterUserPremiumuserid123456ap  pHow can I get this to be called only when a purchase is made The most elegant way seems like Apple pinging the URL with a special user ID upon purchase, but I cant find a way of doing it. It is obviously not a solution to make the user call that URL within the app, as it can be crackedpirated. What is a good way of providing such a mechanism that is piracyproof. My service is webbased, so if I can get this part done, the rest relies on my serverside mechanism the user will just send a special key that is stored in its keychain, to the server so Ill be able to finish the project. In short, I need a way to call a URL only when a purchase is made. What are some possible solutionsp  pThanks,p  pCan.p

Negative 20711 pI have been reading about making ajax heavy applications more search engine friendly  a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsgettingstarted relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsgettingstartedap  pOne of the solutions I have delivered recently relies heavily upon cross domain javascript widgets. A website that integrates this solution would include a piece of javascript in their website. For examplep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt   var lw  lw     lw.setAccount   00000000000000000000000000000000    lw.widgetType  widgetName   lw.options        function      var scriptsrc  document.createElementscript      scriptsrc.type  textjavascript      scriptsrc.async  true     scriptsrc.src  httphostnameApplicationjs      var s  document.getElementsByTagNamescript[0] s.parentNode.insertBeforescriptsrc, s    ltscriptgt]  ltdiv idwidgetcontainergtltdivgt codepre  pThis request appends to the dom a jQuery wrapper along with relevant application URLs that the widget will use. Note, the source of this piece of javascript is simply an asp.net mvc content result which outputs the relevant contentp  precode[HttpGet] [ActionNamejs] public ContentResult RenderJavascript         java script urls amp jquery wrapper are output  codepre  pNow that the necessary urls are available, the jQuery wrapper that was just appended kicks in and fires off a request to the server with the account information, the widget type and any relevant options. codeASP.net MVCcode is simply acting as a content generator and it returns a codeJSONPcode result where the generated content is appended into the sites content container.p  precodefunction loadWidget      var jsonpUrl  opts.widgetUrl  lw.setAccount     jQuery.getJSONjsonpUrl, lw.options, function data          jQuerywidgetcontainer.htmldata.html       codepre  pThe more I read on making this process more search engine friendly Im at a loss of where to start. Generating the required HTML snapshot is easy enough however, stronghow would I signify to google that a link should be crawledstrongp  pAnother option that seemed somewhat promising was the section on how to handle pages without hash fragments. This would be accomplished by adding a meta tag that is making use of the javascript widgets. p  precodeltmeta namefragment contentgt codepre  pHowever, the problem now is in the fact that this is a cross domain request and again wont lead anywhere.p

This is nontraditional at least to me in the sense that we are providing the purchased audio files for download immediately after payment.p  pAlso, note that there is a lot of Audio files and, if not too difficult, we would like to keep track of sales on each item purchased.p  pHow should I designimplement this situation, while using PayPal.p  pOn a separate note, in the future I would like to keep track of Users and who purchases which items, so that in case something bad happened during the audio download, the user would have the chance to reretrieve the downloaded item.p  pTechnology  ASP.NET 4 MVC 3p

Negative 20711 pIve been trying to understand Javascript closures, and thought I was onto something. I have managed to successfully return an iterated integer generated by a for loop within my inner function. p  pHowever, this function in question also takes a parameter generated by the function itself. Forgive my terminology  but it may be a callaback parameter basically, the parameters value is returned based on the function I send out.p  pThere is more explanation of my problem below, but first of all, here is the code in question with the closure working  [value] is a changing value of i for each iterationp  precodeFB.apimetaggedlimit100, functionresponse   for var i0 iltresponse.data.length i      var taggedId  response.data[i].id     var fromId  response.data[i].from.id     var fromName  response.data[i].from.name      var taggedQuery  new Parse.Querytagged     taggedQuery.equalTotaggedId,taggedId     taggedQuery.first .first returns the first match .find returns all         success functionvalue              return function              console.logresponse.data[value]                      i,         error functiontaggedRecError             console.logerror taggedRecError.message               for  codepre  pSo basically, in the above, Im querying Facebook to get the users tagged posts. I use a for loop to iterate through each result.p  pI then use Parse.js to query whether I have a record saved for this tagged object. p  pI want my code to recognise whether or not I do have a saved object. In Parse I would usually do this using something like the followingp  precodetaggedQuery.first .first returns the first match .find returns all         success functionvalue                  ifvalue                    do nothing                                   else                     do something  e.g. save to Parse data store                             codepre  pSo, as you can see, I use the existence of a returned paramater value in order to decide what to do next.p  pHowever, in the first code block, you can see that in order to get the closure working I have to pass a parameter i directly into the success function in order to get the appropriate value of i for use within the function. However, this then distorts the result we get from Parse  i.e. the returned object comes from me passing in a parameter  not from Parse returning one based on my data storep  pI seem to be in a catch 22 pass in a parameter manually to get successful closure but then lose the returned paramater from the Parse call, or pass in no parameter to ensure Parse returns the correct response based on my data stores but then have the wrong value of i within said function i.e.  no closure.p  pI hope thats clear. If not please let me know. Any help appreciated.p

Negative 20711 pOur Android app connects to an LDAP db for authentication and user data email address, phone number, etc.. Until now, the app has connected to a piece of middleware that opens the connection to LDAP and performs operations for the app. The app just sends a basic request like Authenticate the user, and grant them the role if they dont have it, and the middleware is set up to handle only those possible requests.p  pNow, weve been asked to skip the middleware, and connect to LDAP straight from the app. The issue is that, as far as I can see, theres no way to emnotem hardcode the password of the master LDAP user in the app, and I know .apk files are easy to decompile.p  pIs there any way to securely connect directly to the LDAP from a client app on phones belonging to the general public without using middlewarep

Negative 20711 pI am working on an architecture with 2 CPUs connected only by a shared memory region and some GPIOIRQs. They are completely separate so they dont share any cache. However the plan is to have both executing out of the same Linux OS image in shared memory. I am wondering how would IPC mechanisms like shared memory, signals, etc. work Since the two CPUs are executing out of the same RAM, as long as those mechanisms are kept in RAM then I assume when one CPU went to check the state of a shared memory region it would work as long as there were no coherency problems. How would signals software interrupts work in this kind of setup Is it all handled in RAM Would there be coherency issuesp

Negative 20711 pIm completely aware that a question of similar context has been asked many times in many places including here, and potentially solved  I have definitely made a decent amount of research regarding the matter and have also realized the reason behind the script errors is most likely due to the WebBrowser control using the IE7 platform rather than the latest IE9 in my case  I believe its not really optional what control it usesp  pSomeone did post a work around, however it involves editing the registry via. code something I cannot do as this application is being made out of my own good will for the company I work for, it doesnt mean however that im allowed to do things permitted to Administrators alone, especially tampering with something as delicate as the registry.p  pSo in the end up, I want to ask you guys is there anyway at all you could provide me with a solution that 1. is inclusive and doesnt require any extra work, and 2. isnt just suppressing the errors, but instead adding that functionality back in by making it work as some things that use scripts are quite key.p  pIs there a way of getting the control to use a different browser package, one I could possibly include in the installation setupp  pRegards,p  pHughp

But if i run the above code, although the buffer is correctly filled, the performance is so slow or maybe not  You decide  that i can read those 4194304 bytes in strongalmost 5 secondsstrong, thats strongless than 1MB per secondstrong. Im using Eclipse directly connected to my Optimus Dual smartphone the same time is required for the read even if i put the reading operation in a loop maybe overhead initialization wouldnt take place if multiple reads are performed...Not the case.p  pThis file sizetime relation doesnt change if i reduce or make the file larger 8 megs will be read in almost 9 seconds, 2 megs in 2 seconds, and so on. Ive read that even a slow SD card can be read at a speed of at least 5 MB per second... Note that 4194304 is a power of 2 value, since ive read that this would increase performance. Please tell me your opinion is 1MB per second the actual performance on a modern smartphone, or is there something wrong with my code  Thank youp

Negative 20711 pSo were running into a problem where the container is holding onto instances of DerivedTypeConstructorSelectorPolicy for the duration of the application. This wouldnt be so bad were it not for the fact that the following two lines of code in TypeInterceptionStrategy wraps the old policy into a new one, which then now holds onto two instances or more, every call to Resolve for an intercepted class will compound the problem. You can see this when running .NET Memory Profiler.p  precodeIConstructorSelectorPolicy originalConstructorSelectorPolicy  PolicyListExtensions.GetltIConstructorSelectorPolicygtcontext.Policies, object context.BuildKey, out containingPolicyList PolicyListExtensions.SetltIConstructorSelectorPolicygtcontainingPolicyList, IConstructorSelectorPolicy new TypeInterceptionStrategy.DerivedTypeConstructorSelectorPolicyproxyType, originalConstructorSelectorPolicy, object context.BuildKey codepre  pThis is causing thrashing of the Gen 2 collection when you have a lot of classes being intercepted and then you get holes in memory that the GC cannot reclaim, especially as policies get copied to ensure thread safety. Once you have a sufficient number of items in the policy list, it will get moved to the LOH, which makes the thrashing even worse.p  pI should caveat this with the fact that our application is running in IIS Classic and not Integrated Pipeline and in 32bit mode, double whammy, I know. With more addressable space in 64bit mode, this wouldnt be so bad. But still, were stuck with the virtual memory that is given to us by IIS and this goes quickly as the GC cant find enough space in the VM map to allocate additional memory and requests start dying.p  pThe file only has 3 revisions, with the original revision looking like it did not have this issue. Has anyone else run into this problem or am I missing something that perhaps explains this behaviorp  pA link to a very simple program that illustrates this is posted on pastebin a hrefhttppastebin.comDYG3GXNm relnofollowhttppastebin.comDYG3GXNmap  pUsing .NET Memory Profiler or your profiler of choice and watching for the DerivedTypeConstructorSelectorPolicy, you can watch it grow through each iteration and as it grows, you can examine and see the originalConstructorSelectorPolicy keeps referencing the old instance in a long chain.p  pAs an example of how many classes we intercept, its on the order of about 1300 or so registrations.p  pTIAp

Negative 20711 pI have the following method definition which is intended to search a JSON object for a given key and return either the JSONObject or the String value of that key. To ensure it searches through every level of the JSON object I have made it recursive, but only in the event that a deeper JSONObject can be returned. The compiler complains that this must return an Object because I have declared that return type. Fine. In two cases I am returning an object but I think its problem is that in some circumstances it will not return anything. If I add a final return false, or something, it will pass the compiler check but a call to this method will always then eventually return false making it useless. I am not used to a strictly typed language like Java so I havent encountered a similar issue before.

Negative 20711 pI fall back to CanvasRenderer if users browser does not support WebGL.  I would like to have wireframe only rendering when using CanvasRenderer for performance reasons. However I cannot get overrideMaterial to work with it. Its working with WebGLRendererer quite nicely like thisp  precodescene.overrideMaterial   new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial color 0xffffff, wireframe true    codepre  pIn CanvasRenderer this seems to have no effect, making FireFox unresponsive because the code is just too heavy for all but the simplest models.p  pPreviously I had replaced all object materials directly with wireframe material by traversing the scene geometries and just overwriting the real materials. That kind of works, but  makes material and object management guite messy, as I would like to have the material information present in the models even if they are not rendered.p  pIs it possible use scene.overrideMaterial with CanvasRenderer Or other way to force wireframe rendering Im using r54.p

Negative 20711 pI have a acyclic directed graph with a start vertice and an end vertice and some unknown number of vertices in between. A path starts from start vertice and end at end vertice. It is known that the number of vertices along the any paths between the start vertice and end vertice lt100, but the number of possible vertices could be very large. Each vertice has a cost assigned to it, and the cost of the path is summation of the cost of vertices in between.

Here is my scriptp  precodeimport sys import time   class MyObjobject     def initself, filename         with openfilename as f             self.att  f.read   def myfuncfilename     mylist  [MyObjfilename for x in xrange100]     lenmylist     return []   def main     filename  sys.argv[1]     myfuncfilename     time.sleep3600   if name  main     main codepre  pThe main function calls codemyfunccode which creates a list of 100 objects that each open and read a file. After returning from codemyfunccode, Id expect memory from the 100item list and from reading the file to be freed since they are no longer referenced. However, when I check the memory usage using the codepscode command, the Python process uses about 10,000 KB more memory than a Python process run from a script with lines 12 and 13 commented out.p  pThe strange thing is that the memory leak if thats what it is only seems to occur for files lt128KB in size. I created a bash script to run this script with files ranging in size from 1KB to 200KB and the memory increase stopped when the files size hit 128KB. Here is the bash scriptp  precodebinbash  echo PID RSS S TTY TIME COMMAND gt output.txt  for i in seq 1 200 do     python debugmemory.py datastuffiK.txt amp     pid     sleep 0.1     ps e O rss  grep pid  grep v grep gtgt output.txt     kill pid done    codepre  pHere is the output of the bash scriptp  precodePID RSS S TTY TIME COMMAND 28471  5552 S pts16   000000 python debugmemory.py

In VC, if I enable optimization maximizing speed the above function contains a local variable called c by looking at the generated assembly listing.

Negative 20711 pIn short Is there a supported way to create an Android project for eclipse as you would get via the new Android project wizard programmatically  Or if not supported, then is there any way at all  this is being done within an eclipse plugin p  pIve been trying to do this for a while, and it is turning out to be much more difficult than expected.  I took a look at the source for both the New and the Import wizards for Android projects, and found that they both use the NewProjectCreator class.  There seem to be two ways to use this class one is via the static create method, and the other is to construct an instance of NewProjectCreator and call createAndroidProjects.  However, Im having trouble getting ahold of all the necessary parameters for either of these.  The static method requires both an IAndroidTarget and a ProjectPopulator, neither of which I can find implementations of There is an anonymous implementation of ProjectPopulator in the NewProjectWizard class, but pasting this into my code is disastrous in the number of classes and fields it cant find.  The instance method on the other hand requires an IWizardContainer, but I would like to be able to do this without bringing up a wizard.p  pAt the other end of the spectrum, Ive tried simply adding and Android nature to the project, but this causes all sorts of build errors, since it doesnt actually change the setup of the project to reflect whatever the Android standards are.  I guess another option is to take this route and try to set up the whole project manually, but I dont know if there are any guidelines for this, or whether the project standards are likely to change.p  pDoes anyone know how to do this  Thanks in advancep

Negative 20711 pI have made a textbox with a border in HTML by means of a table. The image that I am tiling for the height of it is 64x64 and only tiles properly when the height is set to a multiple of 64. 128, for example. The text on the inside has its padding set to ten pixels, so that would be 12820 in order to tile properly. When however much text has been typed, the height obviously changes on its own accord to the point that it does not tile properly. Is there a way to make the height increase by sixtyfour pixels whenever more space is needed for the text, or is the only solution to type all of the text and images in advance, count the number of tiles, calculate the height, and use that number for the height I havent found any topics like this online yet, so I look forward to everyones input on having TD height increase in multiples. Thank youp  precodelttrgt lttd stylebackgroundurl64x64VerticalImage.png width64px height64pxgtlttdgt lttd stylewidthauto height108px verticalaligntop padding10pxgtText here.lttdgt lttd stylebackgroundurl64x64VerticalImage.png width64px height64pxgtlttdgt lttrgt codepre  pThe vertical image tiles per sixtyfour pixels, so the height must be a multiple of sixtyfour, minus twenty for the text padding.

Negative 20711 pI recently moved from developing with codeblocks to developing with kdevelop.

Not really sure why, but okay thats what was decided, so Ill live with it.p  pI dont really know anything about cmake. I guess it is like makep  pWhat I really want to know is how do I set cmake to use g with the flag codestdc11code.p  pAccording to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14894852enablecompilerwarningsinkdevelopstackoverflow  questiona, I should be able to use codelistAPPEND CMAKECXXFLAGS CMAKECXXFLAGS stdc11code  but I think this might work only for make and not cmake...p  pAnyone know how to set compiler options in kdevelop Also could anyone explain why cmake is used, rather than most other IDEs which I have encountered before. Im guessing there is a good reason for it.p
Negative 20711 pIm writing an Android application that needs to be able to seek to specific points in a large mp3 audio file 90minutes with good accuracy.p  pCurrently, Im using an OpenSL approach with an audio player object with a URI data source that specifies the mp3 file and MIME information.p  pTo test this out, I use the SLSeekITF interface on the player to seek to specific points specified in milliseconds. However, I find that the seeking performance is poor and inconsistent. Often the audio is 110 seconds off from where it should be. Sometimes ahead, sometimes behind. Performance is a little bit better using shorter mp3 files, but nowhere near close enough.p  pThe Seek modes accurate and fast dont seem to make any difference on SLSeekITF.p  pOn other platforms, I can get the seek position to be very accurate lt 50msec which is barely noticeable, so I know this is possible. p  pDoes anyone know how to get better accuracy out of the OpenSL audio player Are there known issues with this implementation Are there other mp3 decoders available that offer better performancep  pThanksp

Once codebufferFullcode becomes true, the messages codeapplyDSP is Truecode and codebufferFull is Truecode should be diplayed alternatively everytime the infinite loop executes.

I want the logcat output to be streamed to the file as it is streamed to the logcat panel in the android SDK.p

Negative 20711 pI went to interview for a program job recently and they asked me to write some function that would take a vector and a integer as parameters. The task was to count the number of elements in the vector that were above, below or equal to the integer.

They said that passing codeveccode and codevalcode by reference was less efficient than by value. That it would have been better to writep  precodevoid printStatconst stdvectorltintgt vec, const int val  codepre  pTo be honest, I have always written my code using the first version at the top and didnt really have the argument to explain why my method would be better or no different than theirs. Their argument was that passing the argument by reference forces later one to dereference the variable when you want its content, which is slower than if I had passed the variable by value. p  pSo my question is whats the best way, and what would be the reasonp  pBonus Question they also argued that using an iterator in the loop would have been more efficient than using the code[]code operator to access the element of the vector. I dont see any reason for this, particularly as I suspect that codevec[i]code will be in the L1 cache when accessed twice in line 5.p  pThank you.p

Negative 20711 pIm using a media query to set my style content on Iphone. This all looks great except I want to add padding around the wrapper. When I add 20px to the left and right it adds it but its pushing it to the right off the screen. I thought by adding it to the right would push it back in 20px from the left of the browser screen so I would get some nice margins on each side of the wrapper.

Negative 20711 pIm trying to separate this csv file into a 2D list. The problem with my code currently is that it cuts off a few fields on lines with quotes in the data. There are quotes there to signify that the comma within is not part of the comma separation of fields and is actually part of the field. I posted the code, example data, and example output.

Negative 20711 pIm trying to animate a moving meter by rotating it more than 180 degrees, but it wont work. Im using codeCGAffineTransformcode to rotate the meter, which uses a net result to make the rotation. This means that i cannot choose CW or CCW rotation when using this function. How can I modified this code to make it rotate 4 radians.

Negative 20711 pLike many others I have been fighting hard to understand androids fragments in combination with the view pager.p  pHere is setup in portrait mode an activity has a xml layout that includes a viewpager that is bound to a FragmentStatePagerAdaper. This adapter does a good job constraining number of active fragments.p  pWhen the device is rotated the xml layout is very different with only one fragment and no viewpager. It works fine from a user perspective, but from the debugger and the fragment managers debug logging I can see that the last active fragments from the portrait layout is still alive and being resumed in the landscape mode as well. These fragments might perform some intensive data retrieval or other computation, and thus consume non significant resources and I want to get rid of them.p  pThen when device is rotated back to portrait mode I again can see that the fragment from landscape mode is still alive and being resumed.p  pThe fragment in landscape mode is added to the fragment manager by code, and thus I can detect that it is hanging around in portrait mode and remove it from the fragmanager. But I have no clue of how to achieve the opposite i.e. remove orphan fragments managed by the view pager when being in landscape mode. I have seen some hacks that try to remove fragments by a known tag syntax, but the state adapter does not add fragments with a tag as of the source a hrefhttptinyurl.commdcuhk2 relnofollowhttptinyurl.commdcuhk2a and I dont like this hacky idea.p  pI hope someone knows a ways around this.p

Negative 20711 pIm using the First Data E4 Gateway Hosted Payment Pages. p  pUnder Payment Pages  Receipt Page Settings Ive selected Automatic linking to the receipt page including result parameters using HTTP POST method AUTOPOST. Im not use Relay Response right now.p  pEnvironment C, Sql Server, ASP.NET 4.0, Sql Server 2008 R2.p  pIve successfully sent payment transaction form values to the E4 servers and most of the time I receive the receipt transaction values back to my receipt page.p  pHowever, sometimes the form values are not available. This is a problem because with no form values I cant update our database with the results of the credit card transaction and then I cant display our confirmation page because well we dont know if the transaction was successful or not.p  pIve spoken with First Data E4 technical support and they tell me 1 Theyve never heard of a customer not getting the transaction form values, 2 they simply POST the data but dont check if the customers server actually received the data, 3 they have no error logs so they are not able to tell me if there was a problem on our servers.p  pIve enabled Failed Request Tracing but have not seen any failures.p  pIve tried to capture the form values at various points in the page life cyclep  p1 PageLoad 2 PageInit 3 PagePreInit 4 Renderp  pAgain I sometimes get the form values and sometimes I dont regardless of what stage I try to grab the values. My guess at this point is that our server is slow to respond to the request for the receipt page and E4 servers probably give up and thus we dont get the form values.p  pI just added capture of Request.ContentLength to our transaction logs. Im wondering in the cases where we dont get any form values maybe well get a count in ContentLength and perhaps that will give us a clue as to the problem. Ive not received sufficient transaction yet to see where we got a nonzero ContentLength and no form values.p  pThe First Data tech suggested switching to Relay Response to ensure that we eventually get the transaction information so we can update our database. Even if we switch to relay response theres still going to be some cases where we dont get the data on the first POST attempt from E4 servers which means we cant redirect the user to our custom subscription confirmation page.p  pHeres the code for our receipt page.

Negative 20711 pI am running ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I have data in an excel spreadsheet that I wish to import into Postgres, from my windows 7 machine to my ubuntu machine. Someone else, who is very fond of open source software, is consistently telling me about the virtues of open source software as opposed to proprietary windowsbased software, and therefore took it upon himself to set me up a fully functioning ubuntu machine complete with Postgres. I am a windows person, or at least that is my primary operating system with regards to computers.p  pThe data contains fields relating to Field ID, First Name, Last Name, Address, and Zip Code. The spreadsheet has approximately 1500 rows.p  pMy questions, in orderbr 1 How do I determine if Postgres is properly installed and running on my ubuntu machinep  p2 How do I create a database in Postgres which has those field names, and approximately 1500 rowsp  p3 How do I import that data from the .xls file format that it is in right now, into that database that I created, so that those 1500 rows become properly inserted into the Postgres fieldp  pBeing a windows user, my first instinct would be to work in a graphical environment, and use the copypaste functions from one program to the other program. However, I do not think that Postgres is a graphical based program, so I do not think that the pointclick method I have developed within my windows computer use will be very applicable.p  p4 I assume that within Postgres, there are functions which allow me the user to lookup specific fields on the basis of certain elements, and return a list of those elements. So what would the syntax be, lets say, if I wanted to look up all the rows with the last name Obama would it return all rows which had the last name Obama What would the return values look like, and what form would they be output inp  p5 Could the output be fed to the windows environment, or does it have to stay within the ubuntu frame of referencep  p Sorry if these questions show a complete lack of due diligence on my part with respect to open source software and ubuntu, but I am simply not familiar with the nuances of open source software, yet I am told that they are excellent resources to be proficient in, cost less, and are seemingly more capable, with respect to proprietary windows based software.p

Negative 20711 pI need to test the combination of two parameters, each having only a few possibilities. So I want to have a class hierarchy, where each subclass has its own fixed parameter A, while Parameter B can be tested based on that common A.

The problem were having is that the sheer volume of little files ends up wasting large amounts of disk space due to the cluster size.p  pIdeally wed locate the worst offending import processes and put in place some automated archiving on the files into .zip files or something similar. Building a report on this should be a relatively simple problem, but Im struggling to get an accurate size on disk as seen in Explorer. Yes we could just archive everything after X days, but its not ideal and doesnt necessarily help tune import processes that could be adapted somewhat to avoid the issuep  pIve seen answers like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions554010howtogettheactualsizeondiskofafilefrompowershell557890557890How to get the actual sizeondisk of a file from PowerShella but whilst they work well for dealing with compressed folders, I just get the same value as the file length for short files and so underestimate true disk usage.p  pThe files on the volume vary from some small enough to fit into the MFT records, some which only occupy a small percentage of a cluster and others that are very large. NTFS Compression isnt enabled anywhere on the volume, though a solution which could accommodate that would be more futureproof as we may enable it in future. The volume is normally accessed via a UNC share so if its possible to determine usage via the share Explorer seems able to that would be great, but its not essential as the script can always run on the server itself and access the drive directly. p
Negative 20711 pIve created a wrapped up QGLWidget class and am trying to create a basic sprite factory style class that accesses it. In my SpriteMachine think sprite factory class, Im trying to do all of the sprite drawing using VBOs, and a glDrawElements call in my code its just drawElements, accessing a wrapper function in the parent that calls glDrawElements. I get an access violation on drawElements and I cant figure out why. p  pI checked and Im almost certain my vertex data is well formatted. Also, Im calling initializeGlFunctions in the initializeGL method of the parent widget before any drawing happens so I dont think I improperly initialized everything.

Negative 20711 pI am trying to determine the best way to use JSDoc 3 to document the attributes and options arguments to a codeBackbone.Modelcode.p  pIdeally Id like to be able to dop  precode    class    attribute string foo the foo attribute    attribute integer bar the bar attribute    option    bolean baz the baz option    option    string qux the qux option    var MyModel  Backbone.Model.extend     ...  codepre  pHowever there is no codeoptioncode tag in JSDoc 3, and codeattributecode doesnt mean the same thing as a Backbone attribute.  In theory I think one could somehow make custom tags like the ones in my pseudocode, but I couldnt find any existing plugin with these, and the documentation on how to create custom tags is almost nonexistent.p  pSo, since I seem stuck with the builtin tags for now, my question is whats the next best thing to my pseudocode using actual JSDoc 3 tagsp  pNOTE There are several similar questions to this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6438800howtojsdocannotatebackbonejscodeHow to jsdoc annotate BackboneJS codea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15166343howdoidocumentamdbackboneprojectwithjsdoc3How do I document AMD  Backbone project with JSDoc3a but they all focus on the big picture of getting Backbone objects recognized at all.  I couldnt find any that specifically addressed the issue of attributesoptions.p
Negative 20711 pHow I can have an applicationcode with two separate executable sections.

Negative 20711 pI know this issue a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9354966stringsortingissueincsharp93550869355086has been noted beforea, more or less concisely, but I still create this new thread because I ran into the issue again when writing a unit test.p  pThe default string comparison that is the culturedependent casesensitive comparison that we get with codestring.CompareTostringcode, codeComparerltstringgt.Defaultcode, codeStringComparer.CurrentCulturecode, codestring.Comparestring, stringcode and others violates transitivity when the strings contain hyphens or minus signs, I am talking about plain U002D characters.p  pHere is a simple reprop  precodestatic void Main    const string a  fk   const string b  fk   const string c  Fk    Console.WriteLinea.CompareTob   1   Console.WriteLineb.CompareToc   1   Console.WriteLinea.CompareToc   1    var listX  new Listltstringgt  a, b, c,    var listY  new Listltstringgt  c, a, b,    var listZ  new Listltstringgt  b, c, a,    listX.Sort   listY.Sort   listZ.Sort   Console.WriteLinelistX.SequenceEquallistY   False   Console.WriteLinelistY.SequenceEquallistZ   False   Console.WriteLinelistX.SequenceEquallistZ   False  codepre  pIn the upper part we see how transitivity fails. codeacode is less than codebcode, and codebcode is less than codeccode, yet codeacode fails to be less than codeccode.p  pThis goes against the a hrefhttpwww.unicode.orgfaqcollation.html5 relnofollowdocumented behaviora of Unicode collation which states thatp  blockquote   p... for any strings A, B, and C, if A lt B and B lt C, then A lt C.p blockquote  pNow sorting a list with codeacode, codebcode and codeccode is exactly like trying to rank the hands of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRockpaperscissors relnofollowRock, Paper and Scissorsa in the wellknown intransitive game. An impossible task.p  pThe last part of my code sample above shows that the result of sorting depends on the initial order of the elements and there are no two elements in the list which compare equal code0code.p  pLinqs codelistX.OrderByx gt xcode is also affected, of course. This should be a stable sort, but you get strange results when ordering a collection containing codeacode, codebcode and codeccode together with other strings.p  pI tried this with emallem the codeCultureInfocodes on my machine since this is a culturedependent sort, including the invariant culture, and each and every one has the same problem. I tried this with the .NET 4.5.1 runtime, but I believe older versions have the same bug.p  pConclusion When sorting strings in .NET with the default comparer, results are unpredictable if some strings contain hyphens.p  pstrongWhat changes were introduced in .NET 4.0 that caused this behaviorstrongp  pIt has already been observed that this behavior is inconsistent across different versions of the platform in .NET 3.5, strings with hyphens can be reliably sorted. In all versions of the framework, calling codeSystem.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.CompareInfo.GetSortKeycode provides unique codeDeyDatacode for these strings, so why arent they sorted correctlyp

Negative 20711 pI have installed Pentaho Community Edition 5.0.1 and successfully created a new data source from a MySQL database both hosted on my PC.I now want to perform OLAP analysis on this data, but am not entirely sure how to proceed So please provide additional information in the case where it is clear from my questions that I am heading on a wrong path  I am new to OLAP.p  pThe Saiku plugin is installed and I can view the 2 premade cubes SampleData and SteelWheels. I now want to create one or more cubes referencing the data in the data source that I had previously created, which is where I am stuck. As I understand it, I need to create a Mondrian schema which defines the cube, going by a hrefhttpwww.joyofdata.debloggettingstartedwithpentahobiserver5mondrianandsaiku relnofollowthisa I created the shema for the data source as defined on the same tutorial as p  precodeltSchema nametestdbgt   ltCube nameTest Cubegt ltTable nametesttablegt ltTablegt ltDimension nameDategt   ltHierarchy hasAlltruegt     ltLevel nameDate columndate typeIntegergt   ltHierarchygt ltDimensiongt ltDimension nameKey 1gt   ltHierarchy hasAlltruegt     ltLevel nameKey 1 columnkey1 typeStringgt   ltHierarchygt ltDimensiongt ltDimension nameKey 2gt   ltHierarchy hasAlltruegt     ltLevel nameKey 2 columnkey2 typeStringgt   ltHierarchygt ltDimensiongt ltMeasure nameValue columnvalue aggregatorsumgt codepre  p p  pThe tutorial states that this file can be placed anywhere I, assuming in the biserverce folder or sub folders  any best practices on location. When refreshing the cubes by pressing the green arrows icon in Saiku  big surprise  the new cube is not listed, only SampleData and SteelWheels are options in the dropdown Pentaho had been restarted etc, no effect. When inspecting the created schema, there is no reference to the created data source, so I have no idea how it can be linked or used by SaikuPentaho. This is where I think the problem lies, I need to register this file somehow. I have seen references to a data source definition file a hrefhttpdocs.analyticallabs.comsaikudocumentationconfiguration20130815datasources.html relnofollowlike herea which seems to be what I need to do. I cant however find where this file should be placed, what it should be named or any tutorial incorporating such a step. I also find it strange that one has to break out of the usage flow of the Pentaho application to make external files which are needed for following steps  hints that I am doing things wrong.p  pstrongIn summarystrong How to create OLAP cube using Pentaho CE and Saiku from a working data sourcep  pIt has been surprisingly difficult to find well documented help on usage of Pentaho CE with Saiku and warnings on the numerous issues in the setup, I think verbose answers on this question will be of help to the communityp

Unfortunately, I see blank values for every field, meaning the data wasnt actually saved.p  pI tried testing with validations and validating only the title but it didnt work because the values were not saved. On the other hand, when I run rails console, I can create new instances of the games class and they get saved to the database. So I have no idea why it doesnt work on the form.p  pIve tried calling the create method with params[game] and also with strong parameters. It never works, it just returns blank valuesp  pHere is my rake routes filep  precodeGamesApplication.routes.draw do    get staticpagesabout   get staticpagescontact   get staticpageshelp    resources games end codepre  pBy request, I will add my gemfile.p  precodegem rails, 4.0.4  gem sqlite3  gem sassrails, gt 4.0.2  gem uglifier, gt 1.3.0  gem coffeerails, gt 4.0.0  gem jqueryrails  gem turbolinks  gem jbuilder, gt 1.2  group doc do   gem sdoc, require false end codepre  pMy question is how do I get these values to show up when submitting form data Does it have something to do with my routes I declared resources games to link the 7 RESTFUL routes on one line. p  pI know that POST requests are used for the create method. I find it puzzling, that it works in rails console, but not on the form.p  pI searched extensively on StackOverflow and found one answer regarding strongparams. Unfortunately, I incorporated that into my controller, and it still didnt work. I still think my problem lies in how Im using strongparams. p  pI basically cut and pasted the code in that answer so it might not work in this case. I tried reading the documentation as well, but I couldnt understand it.p

Negative 20711 pIm creating a very general annotation processor e.g. xjc which scans my source and generates extra classes based on it.  Ideally the domainspecific library should depend on the annotation processor library which has no knowledge of the domain.p  pTwo of the fields that Im placing in the annotation processor are minVersion and maxVersion.  The code would look something like thisp  precodeProcessMeminVersionVersion.135, maxVersionVersion.15 private Foo fieldFoo codepre  pThe goal would be for the annotation processor to create an object which only does special processing if the version of the request is between 1.3.5 and 1.5.p  pUnfortunately, for this to work, the annotation processor needs to know about codeProcessMecode and codeProcessMecode needs to know about codeVersioncode and codeVersioncode is domain specific.p  pMy original thought was that I would have a VersionInfo interface which Version implements all I need is to be able to enumerate the possible values and compare them.  Unfortunately, even if VersionInfo extends Enum I am unable to specify it in the annotation as annotations can only include primitive, string, class, annotation, enumeration, and 1D arrays of the above.p  pSo, can anyone think of a way to make this work that doesnt require the annotation processor to have domain specific knowledge the version is domain specific because one product may use a completely different versioning scheme than another product.p

I am working on a project which draws a few plane indicators on screenlike altimeter, compass etc. After doing the tutorial from the official google dev site here a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtraininggraphicsopenglindex.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtraininggraphicsopenglindex.htmla I just continued along this path, drawing circles, triangles, squares etc only 2d stuff. I can make the drawn objects move using rotation and translation matrices, but the only way I know how to do thisexcept for how they did it in the tutorial is like this in the onDrawFrame method of my renderer classp  precodeset values for all Indicators try  Thread.sleep1  for roll  pitch ifroll lt 90  roll  1.5f  else roll  0 ifpitch lt 90  pitch  0.5f  else pitch  0  for compass ifcompassDeg gt 360 compassDeg  0 else compassDeg  1 for altimeter ifrealAltitude gt 20000 realAltitude  0 else realAltitude  12 for speedometer ifrealSpeed gt 161 realSpeed  0 else realSpeed  3   catch InterruptedException e  e.printStackTrace  codepre  proll, pitch, compassDeg, speed etc are the parameters the indicators receive and I designed them to move accordingly if compassDeg  0 for example, the compass will point north and so on. These parameters will eventually be received via bluetooth but for now Im modifying them from the code directly because I dont have a bluetooth implementation yet.  I am pretty sure this is not the best way to do it,  sometimes the drawn objects stutter and seem to go back a few frames, then back again and I dont think pausing the drawing method is a good idea in general. Ive seen that in the tutorial I mentioned in the beginning they use something like thisp  precodeUse the following code to generate constant rotation. Leave this code out when using TouchEvents.         long time  SystemClock.uptimeMillis 4000L  float contAngle  0.090f  int time Matrix.setRotateMcontRotationMatrix, 0, contAngle, 0, 0, 1.0f Matrix.multiplyMMcontMVPMatrix, 0, mMVPMatrix4, 0, contRotationMatrix, 0 codepre  pwhich is still kinda weird I think, there has to be a more straightforward way in which to specify how to draw each frame, to rotate and translate objects frame by frame.  So my question is how do I make everything move frame by frame or something like that, or at least how do I find out when one frame has been drawnp

Does anyone have any other methods that I can try to debug this situation, like I said I have other projects that work just fine and Im not able to modify them to exhibit this behavior.p  pAny assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT Full trace from logcatp  precodeWdalvikvm 4371 Class resolved by unexpected DEX Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity0xa501f5e80x94c6a000 ref [Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity] Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity0xa501f5e80x9528b000 Wdalvikvm 4371 Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity had used a different Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity during preverification Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity 282 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity failed Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity 763 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity failed Edalvikvm 4371 Could not find class com.mycompany.myapp.MainActivity, referenced from method com.mycompany.myapp.tests.MainActivityInstrumentationTest.ltinitgt Wdalvikvm 4371 VFY unable to resolve constclass 2880 LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity in LcommycompanymypackagetestsMainActivityInstrumentationTest Ddalvikvm 4371 VFY replacing opcode 0x1c at 0x0000 Wdalvikvm 4371 Class resolved by unexpected DEX Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity0xa501f5e80x94c6a000 ref [Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity] Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity0xa501f5e80x9528b000 Wdalvikvm 4371 Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity had used a different Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity during preverification Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity 282 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity failed Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity 763 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity failed Edalvikvm 4371 Could not find class com.mycompany.myapp.MainActivity, referenced from method com.mycompany.myapp.tests.MainActivityInstrumentationTest.setUp Wdalvikvm 4371 VFY unable to resolve checkcast 2880 LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity in LcommycompanymypackagetestsMainActivityInstrumentationTest Ddalvikvm 4371 VFY replacing opcode 0x1f at 0x0007 Ddalvikvm 4371 GCFORALLOC freed 261K, 10 free 3376K3712K, paused 2ms, total 2ms Wdalvikvm 4371 Class resolved by unexpected DEX Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity0xa501f5e80x94c6a000 ref [Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity] Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity0xa501f5e80x9528b000 Wdalvikvm 4371 Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity had used a different Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity during preverification Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity 282 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity failed Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity 763 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity failed Wdalvikvm 4371 Class resolved by unexpected DEX Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity0xa501f5e80x94c6a000 ref [Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity] Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity0xa501f5e80x9528b000 Wdalvikvm 4371 Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity had used a different Landroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity during preverification Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity 282 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class Landroidsupportv7appActionBarActivity failed Wdalvikvm 4371 Unable to resolve superclass of LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity 763 Wdalvikvm 4371 Link of class LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity failed Idalvikvm 4371 Could not find method com.mycompany.myapp.MainActivity.getWindow, referenced from method com.mycompany.myapp.tests.MainActivityInstrumentationTest.testTextView Wdalvikvm 4371 VFY unable to resolve virtual method 21012 LcommycompanymypackageMainActivity.getWindow LandroidviewWindow Ddalvikvm 4371 VFY replacing opcode 0x6e at 0x0002 Ddalvikvm 4371 GCFORALLOC freed 348K, 11 free 3541K3964K, paused 2ms, total 2ms ISystem.out 4371 Sending WAIT chunk Idalvikvm 4371 Debugger is active ISystem.out 4371 Debugger has connected ISystem.out 4371 waiting for debugger to settle...

And as you had mentioned, after the control gets to the error transformer that flow of retaining the preserved headers gets broken and the aggregating message group processor receives three different instances of temporary channel and hence removes them. I was planning to have a custom message group processor and modify the conflict resolution strategy for aggregating the header and came up with this config.p  precodeltbean idchannelPreservingAggregatingMessageHandler classorg.springframework.integration.aggregator.AggregatingMessageHandlergt     ltconstructorarg nameprocessor refchannelPreservingMessageGroupProcessorgt ltbeangt codepre  pIm yet to test this out though. But based on this discussion, this does not look like a viable solution.p  pAnd looks like my configuration for error handling in gateway is incorrect.  However, Im confused on this statement of yours Instead of forwarding the message directly, simply handle the error on your error flow and return the result normally to the gateway wrapper.

I figure the animation would reduce stutteringjumpiness, which it did in iOS 7. But in iOS 8, when the scrollView is released from dragging, instead of just animating to the contentInset, the scroll view content jumps down from the point of release really quickly, and then animates up smoothly. Im not sure if this is a bug in iOS 8 or what. Ive also tried addingp  precodescrollView.contentOffset  CGPointZero codepre  pin the animation block, which didnt change anything.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas Any help would be highly appreciated.

Negative 20711 pHow do you get the raw descriptor data from a HID device in Windowsp  pBackgroundp  pI need to get the Manufacturer, Product Name, and Serial Number from a HID device in Windows.

My question is very similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22611445howdoigetthevendorandproductstringsincaseofahiddeviceonwindowsto this onea.

However, I KNOW these devices do have the string information in their descriptors because I am able to see it a hrefhttpwww.uwesieber.deusbtreeviewe.html relnofollowusing USBTreeViewa.p  pThe interesting thing is, even for the devices that do return manufacturer and product names, the values Im getting through hid.dll are very different from the values I see using the above tool which gets the raw data from the USB device.p  pFor example, an Xbox 360 controllerp  precodeVia USB Tree View Device Description        Xbox 360 Controller for Windows Language 0x0409           Microsoft Corporation iProduct                  0x02 Language 0x0409           Controller iSerialNumber             0x03 Language 0x0409           0843806  Via hid.dll using HidDGetManufacturerString, HidDGetProductString, and HidDGetSerialNumberString Description               HIDcompliant game controller Product                   Controller XBOX 360 Controller for Windows Manufacturer              FAILS Serial Number             FAILS codepre  pWinUSB is unable to open these devices at all to retrieve this data as they do not use the winusb.sys driver.p  p1 I dont understand why the values returned by the HidD functions do not match the values in the USB descriptor. 2 I cant find any way to access the raw USB descriptor data for a HID device because I cannot access them with WinUSB.p  hr  pEdit 1p  pOkay, so Ive learned a bit more about HID. It seems the data Im getting through hid.dll is driverspecified data, not data coming from the USB device. HID can apply to devices on transports other than USB as well. So thats fine. Ultimately, what I really want to know is how can I get the USB device when I have the HID device and what API do I use for that. Besides WinUSB which doesnt work, the only thing I can find are kernellevel functions IOCTL. I dont know if thats suitable for a normal, non admin application.p

Negative 20711 pThis is not really a question yet but rather sharing something that happened to me last night and the solution was completely different from those found on stackoverflow or google.p  pAfter adding some new functionality to an existing application which resulted on a couple of changes on the model I deployed the application to our development environment without an issue. However, when I deployed it to our production environment I started getting this There is already an object named TableName in the database. error.p  pClearly, Entity Framework was trying to recreate my model from scratch instead of updating it. After trying several solutions including the Global.asax SetInitializernull, resetting migrations, etc. nothing worked and would only lead to other errors.p  pAt some point I just rolled all of my emattempts to fixem changes back and started from scratch looking for a solution.p  pstrongThe solutionstrong was actually to go into the very first Migrations file typically called eminitem or emInitialem and comment out the code that was trying to create the tables. Afterwards, I could see that there was another migration trying to dropfield also generating an equally ugly error something along the lines of Unable to remove field FieldName because it doesnt exist, so I had to comment that line as well.p  pSo basically, after commenting out a few migration lines, strongeverything started working and the model did get upgraded to the latest versionstrong.p  pNow, heres the question. Clearly, Dev and Prd were out of sync DBwise which is fine, to my eyes but this ended up creating migrations that, for some reason, were not compatible with production and this is where I cannot understand how Entity Framework is not able to manage this. I mean, why was EF trying to create a table if it already existed And why was EF trying to drop a field that was not present in the table schemap  pIs this something not covered by EF Or did something happened at some point that messed up the entire EF set up of my projectp

Negative 20711 pOk, I am thoroughly at a loss here and I dont even know how to phrase this as a Stack Overflow question because it is so vague, but Ill give it a shot.p  pIm writing a Django 1.6 app, with an integrated test suite. This test suite runs fine when run on its own. It runs fine on TravisCI as a coverage command. But whenever I try and run the same coverage command as defined in code.travis.yamlcode on my dev machine using the exact same virtualenv, setup with the exact same modules as TravisCI, it fails with an ImproperlyConfigured ImportError on the very first app in INSTALLEDAPPS.p  pIve double checked the virtualenv, and the TravisCI one is setup from coderequirements.txtcode and codesetup.pycode. p  pIve rewritten all the import statements, I cant find any circular imports which commonly cause this.

Negative 20711 pThis is probably a really stupid question, and I am sorry in advance.  Python noob and I am sure this is a cant see the forest for the trees situation.p  pI have some code that works and parses an xml document.  The problem is that during the for loop I need to backup and ref a different spot in the xml in order to grab a value based on an entry name.p  pThis part works fine.....p  precodepxapiply  pan.xapi.PanXapiapikeyapikeyply, hostnameblah.blah.com pxapiply.getxpathconfig unencode  pxapiply.xmlresult encode  unencode.encodeutf8 root  ET.fromstringencode pano  blah for tp in root.findall.sharedprofilesvulnerabilityentry     profname  tp.getname     for texception in tp.findall.threatexceptionentry         signame  texception.getname         for tune in texception.findall.action             for action in tune                 print pano  ,  profname  ,  signame  ,  action.tag codepre  pMy problem is that I need to loop over the xpath configsharedprofilesvulnerabilityentry for various entries creating a CSV.  When I get to the point that I have the signame defined, I then need to ref a different part of the XML in order to get a severity value xpath configpredefinedthreatsvulnerabilityentry.  Based on the signame value I am looking for a specific entry in this second xpath.  Once I have that severity value I want the rest of the for loop to continue and print what you see in the code plus the new value I grabbed.p
Negative 20711 pI think I have a big data N  1e6 and dimension  3  scenario. I require to do some matrix manipulation such as einsum, matrix inversion etc several times in my code. To give an idea I want to do something like below.p  precodeimport numpy.random as rd  ndata, kdata  1e6, 1e5  x  rd.normal0,1,ndata, kdata,3,3  y  rd.normal0,1,ndata, kdata,3,3 codepre  pFor small ndata, kdata following would be efficient and convenient approach,p  precodexy   einsumpqrs, pqsu gt pqru, x, y  codepre  pSince I have large ndata and kdata above approach becomes a memory bound problem so next bet would be the dot product with nested for loop over ndata and kdata as followsp  precodexyloop1  np.emptyndata, kdata, 3, 3  for j in xrangendata      for k in xrangekdata          xyloop1[j,k]   np.dotx[j,k], y[j,k]  codepre  pGiven what I am taught for loops are nasty in python. Also, I want to use benefits of numpy so thought block matrix approach would be preferable something like followingp  precodenstep  200 ndiv   ndatanstep     kstep  200 kdiv   kdatakstep     xyloop2  np.emptyndata, kdata, 3, 3  for j in xrangendiv      ji, jf  jnstep, j1nstep           for k in xrangekdiv          ki, kf  kkstep, k1kstep               xyloop2[jijf,kikf]   einsumpqrs, pqsu gt pqru, x[jijf,kikf], y[jijf,kikf]  codepre  pAlso, I need these xy or xyloop1 or xyloop2 for my further calculation. So I have to write and read it after every computation. Given the bandwidth of system IO do you reckon best approach would be approach 3 as it means less IO and also small number of iterations in compare to approach 2 If you have any other idea or need more info please let me know. p  pI am new to the stack so please be gentle with me . Any help will be highly appreciated. BTW I am trying to solve a mixture modelling problem for a big data. Thanksp

Now we are engaged in a   great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so   conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great   battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that   field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives   that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that   we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate we can   not consecrate  we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living   and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor   power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember   what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is   for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work   which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.  It is   rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before   us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that   cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we   here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that   this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that   government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not   perish from the earth.p blockquote

Negative 20711 pI have heard that one of the recommendations of emModern Cem is to use codeemplacebackcode instead of codepushbackcode for append in containers codeemplacebackcode accept any version of parameters of any constructor of the type storage in the container.p  pAccording to the standard draft a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2013n3797.pdfN3797a strong23.3.6.5 1strong, say thatp  blockquote   pstrongRemarksstrong Causes reallocation if the new size is greater than the old capacity. If no reallocation happens, all the iterators and references before the insertion point remain valid.

If an exception is thrown by the move constructor of a nonCopyInsertable T, the effects are unspecified.p blockquote  pThis specify what happen when no reallocation is needed, but leave open the problem when the container need to grow.p  pIn this piece of Codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt  int main      stdvectorltunsigned chargt buff 1, 2, 3, 4     buff.emplacebackbuff[0]     buff.pushbackbuff[1]     for const autoamp c  buff          stdcout ltlt stdhex ltlt staticcastltlonggtc ltlt ,           stdcout ltlt stdendl     return 0  codepre  pCompiled with strongVC Visual Studio 2013 Update 4strong and strongGCC 4.9.1 MinGWstrong in emDebugem in Windows 8.1.p  pWhen compiled with VC the output isp  precode1, 2, 3, 4, dd, 2 codepre  pWhen compiled with GCC the output isp  precode1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2 codepre  pChecking the implementation of codeemplacebackcode in VC the difference is that the first lines of code, check if the container need to grow and grow if its needed, in the case that the container need to grow, the reference to the first element strongbuff[0]strong received in the codeemplacebackcode method is invalidated and when the actual setting of the value in the new created element of the container happen the value is invalid.p  pIn the case of the codepushbackcode work because the creation of the element to append is made in the parameter binding before the possible grow of the container.p  pMy question is This behavior, when the container need to grow because a call to codeemplacebackcode and the parameter is a reference to the same container is emimplementation defined, unspecified or there is a problem in the implementation of one of the compiler suppose in VC as GCC behavior is more close to the expectedemp

Then I restart celery and all the pending tasks get executed and everything is back to normal.p  pMy questions arep  ul liHow can I debug where to start looking to find out what the problem isli liHow can I create a mechanism that shall notify me immediately after the problem startsli ul  pMy Stack Django 1.4.8 Celery 3.1.16 RabbitMQ Supervisordp  pThanks, andyp
Negative 20711 pI do have an issue with an overloaded generic method. Consider this examplep  precodeclass Foo       func fooltTgtv T          printlnfooltTgtv T          func fooltTgtx Int, v T          printlnfooltTgtx Int, v T          let foo  Foo foo.foo foo.foo1,  foo.foox 1,  foo.foox 1, v  codepre  pThis prints the following to the consolep  blockquote   pfoov Tbr   foov Tbr   foov Tbr   foov T  p blockquote  pThat is, no matter what, only the method codefooltTgtv Tcode will be selected from the overload resolution. Note The compiler passes a tuple codeInt, Stringcode to the first method instead calling the second method.p  pIs this expected behavior p  pWell, I doubt I do concede that the type parameter can hold a tuple, however I would think that the function codefooltTgtx Int, v Tcode is a better match.p  pUnfortunately, I couldnt find a workaround. The generic method codefooltTgtv Tcode seems to fit everything through passing a tuple  no matter what other overloads exist.p  h2Updateh2  pIn Xcode Version 6.1.1 6A2008a, as opposed to emmethodsem functions bound to a particular type overloaded emfunctionsem  do resolve as expectedp  pConsider this code snippetp  precodefunc fooltTgto T      printlnfooltTgtT, o   func fooltTgtx Int, o T      printlnfooltTgtInt, T, x, o   foo1 foo1, a codepre  pThis prints the following to the consolep  blockquote   pfooT, 1br    fooInt, T, 1, a  p blockquote  pThis makes me believe that this is an issue in the compiler. I filed a bug report.p
Negative 20711 pBeen trying to load data from sqlite and display it on viewpager without much success.p  pI have a viewpager with two tabs which should hold data based on the tagid passed as a parameter of newInstance. There is also an action bar navigation spinner with a list of counties that is used for filter data displayed based on the countyid.p  pAm able to fetch data from server and save it in the sqlite db but displaying it is the problem. Data is not dispalyed on the first page of the viewpager but it exists in the sqlite. Data for the second is the only one laoded.p  pBelow is my implementationp  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.HashMap import java.util.List import java.util.Locale import

I get the error about 1 of the time when I attempt to access a new page and I cannot find any similarities between occurrences. I currently am using Firefox, however I have also tried Internet Explorer and experienced similar errors. I am only opening one page at a time and have tried using the same window and completely quitting the driver before trying to access another page and either way the error still occurs.

Negative 20711 pSo in Python 3, you can generate an ISO 8601 date with .isoformat , but you cant convert a string created by isoformat back into a datetime object because pythons own datetime directives dont match properly. ie z  0500 instead of 0500 which is produced by .isoformat .

Negative 20711 pIm seeing a weird linking issue on Linux with a crossplatform library project that uses CMake to create both an OS X Framework and a Linux shared library from the same source tree. The crossplatform aspect of that project has worked well in the past up to about two years ago, but since then, we have exclusively done development work on OS X. The reason for the temporary Linux abandonment was a developer shortage all those who remained used OS X  there was no technical reason for not building the source on Linux for some years. p  pAnd with one potentially relevant exception more on this later, there have been no fundamental changes to our source in the meantime. But of course Linux has advanced so of course there were some minor snags at first when we went back there. Things like the new version of the compiler complaining about things they had not complained about in the past questionable casts, void pointer voodoo, and such. These issues were resolved in short order.p  pThe entire source tree now compiles again on Mint 17.1 with some definitely harmless remaining warnings. But linking fails with a rather bizarre messagep  precodeLinking CXX shared library libltourLibNamegt.so CMakeFilesltfile1gt.c.o11 error stray 177 in program CMakeFilesltfile1gt.c.o11 error stray 2 in program CMakeFilesltfile2gt.c.o11 error stray 213 in program and so on, thousands of times, with seemingly random values in the quotes for all the object files in the library codepre  pTo me, this looks like the linker is accidentally trying to emcompileem the object files one more time, instead of linking them. Switching between gcc and clang made no difference.p  pAs I already said, there was one potentially relevant structural change to the project since it last compiled under Linux it used to be a combination of only C and ObjectiveC sources. It now contains C, ObjectiveC strongemas well as ObjectiveCemstrong source. On OS X, this change has not caused any issues whatsoever, and it is very hard for me to imagine that this addition of some .mm files is causing what we are seeing here. But still  weirder things have happened.p  pAlso, there is a popular issue with several articles on stackoverflow about erroneously including unicode characters in CC programs. This is not the problem here  no such messages appear during the actual compilation. The circus only starts once linking should happen.p  pThe source tree is far too large to post, and the CMake files are also fairly involved, nested, and large i.e. impossible to include here. To add insult to injury, they have worked fine in the past, on Ubuntu 10.10. Which I dont have around anymore, to test if the current tree still works there that would have been far too easy, I guess. The relevant commands in the CMakeList that generate the library under Linux arep  precodesettargetproperties     ltourLibNamegt      PROPERTIES         VERSION    2.0         SOVERSION  2       targetlinklibraries     ltourLibNamegt     ourotherlinklibraries       install      TARGETS         ltourLibNamegt     DESTINATION         lib      codepre  pwhich still looks o.k. to me at first glance.

Negative 20711 pThe codeUIcode elements in the codeMainActivitycode class need to be preserved and the other class file adds a new codeUIcode element to the main codexmlcode layout thats used by both classes to differing degrees. p  pIts understood that you can create a base abstract class and two concrete inherited classes however in this case there a third supporting class for the second other class and it requires a handler to function.p  pFor perspective, a button in codeactivitymaincode is clicked and it should launch an activity while maintaining the codeUIcode elements used codeMainActivitycode. Furthermore the button has its own class file methods and isnt in codeMainActivitycode.p  pWhat happens now The button is pressed and nothing happens. Manifest confirmed so its not that. Or I allow the main activity or the other activity and it works, both need to work simultaneously.p  pBasically codeMainActivitycode needs to act as the base abstract activity for the separate class file.p

Hence, the order of the arrangements strongdoesstrong matter. Let us also say that if two competitors end with the same result of time, they win the same spot.p  pFor example, strongemE3emstrong contains the following sets of arrangementsp  pstrong1,1,1, 1,1,2, 1,2,1, 1,2,2, 1,2,3, 1,3,2, 2,1,1, 2,1,2,2,1,3, 2,2,1, 2,3,1, 3,1,2, 3,2,1.strongp  pNeedless to say, for example, that the arrangement strong1,3,3strong is invalid, because the two competitors that strongsupposedlystrong ended in the third place, strongactuallystrong ended in the second place. So the above arrangement strongtransfersstrong to strong1,2,2.strongp  pDefine strongemkemstrong to be the number of strongdistinctstrong strongpositionsstrong of the competitors in a subset of strongemEn.emstrong  We have for examplep  pstrong1,1,1  k  1strongp  pstrong1,2,1  k  2strongp  pstrong1,2,3,2  k  3strongp  pstrong1,2,1,5,4,4,3  k  5strongp  pstrongFinallystrong, let strongemMn,kemstrong be the strongnumber of subsetsstrong of strongemEnemstrong in which the competitors ended in strongexactlystrong strongemkemstrong distinct positions.p  pWe get, for example,strongemM3,3  M3,2  6emstrong and strongemM3,1  1emstrong.p  precode codepre  h2Thus far is the questionh2  pIts a problem I came up with solely by myself.

For each stronglstrong, the binomial coefficient strongCn,lstrong symbolizes in how many ways we can pick stronglstrong firstplacers out of the strongnstrong competitors. Once we have chosen them, we to need to figure out in how many ways we can arrange the strongnlstrong competitors we have left, which is just strongEnlstrong.

But Im not 100 sure about this because I was not able to compute this approach for large strongnstrong. However, even with precalculating factorials and memoizing the strongEnsstrong, the calculating times for higher strongnsstrong grow very fast. Is anyone capable of verifying the above formula and values Can anyone derive a better, faster formula Perhaps with generating functionsp  pAs for strongemMn,kemstrong.. Im totally clueless. I absolutely have no idea how to calculate it, and therefore I couldnt post any meaningful data points.  Perhaps its strongPn,k  nnk.strong Can anyone figure out a formula for strongemMn,kemstrong p  pI have no idea which function is harder to compute, either strongemEnemstrong or strongemMn,kemstrong, but helping me with either of them will be very much appreciable.p  pI want the solutions to be generic as well as work efficiently even for large strongnsstrong. Exhaustive search is not what Im looking for, unfortunately.  What I am looking for is solutions based purely on combinatorial approach and efficient formulas.p  pI hope I was clear enough with the wording and what I ask for throughout my post. By the way, I can program using Java. I also know Mathematica pretty decently  .p  pThanks a lot in advance, p  pMatan.p

Negative 20711 pWe have a Java EE application running on a weblogic server with a configured datasource that connects to an Oracle database using EclipseLink. The application needed to access some system tables for a monthly report on database state, however the configured datasource user did not have correct permissions, which resultated in an codeORA00942 Table or View does not existcode error message.p  pWe then granted access to the relevant system tables and confirmed in SQL developer that access was working, however the application itself still received the same error  but the database logs showed no actual requests. Only after restarting everything did the problem disappear.p  pThis leads me to the conclusion that the permissions are being cached somewhere.

Negative 20711 pThe title of this question might not be completely accurate sorry i wasnt sure how to put it into words.p  pWhat i am trying to achieve is in my app i have a list of samples, each sample is a core data object and when i create a new sample i want the name to be prefixed with the current count of the list so if i have two samples in my list and i add a new one then the name will be prefixed with 003. I can get it to display the number 3 its getting it to show 003 im having trouble with, i was thinking of having two NSNumbers and adding them so one would be 000 and the other would be the sample count, but since NSNumber is a wrapper i didnt think this was the best approach. Plus i even tried doing this by converting the number 000 to an int and then i could take the count and add them together but when it gets the int value it just returns a single zero unfortunately.p  pI have had a look at number formatters and i was thinking i could add the two 00 before the number but then what happens if the count is ten would it display as 0010 rather than 010 I know this will probably be a simple answer and i have looked around for a solution and tried different approaches but i cant get my head around it.

Negative 20711 pIm using a number of frameworks, boot, hibernate, etc, in our code, including enhancing and generating code.  When I call what looks like a simple method of code it will go through CglibAoPProxy and similar methods before to call the method I want.  This means if I want to look into the next piece of my code I need to either walk through 5 lays of stack trace for code I presume is functional and thus dont care to trace its logic to get to the next method of code I personally wrote, or add breakpoints and where I want to break, hit run, and then remove the breakpoint after.p  pWhat would be nice is if there was an easy way to tell the debugger that I only want to look at my code.  If I step into a method implemented by some library just keep running until it hits the next line of code that is part of a library I wrote.  Is there an easy way to configure the debugger to do this  to only care about code I personally wrote when stepping into somethingp  pLikewise, when I want to move back up the stack trace, to look at an earlier phase state, its very difficult.  With so many levels of methods from libraries its hard to find the ones that contain code I personally wrote.  Is there a way to highlight only your methods say methods from the current working set or something similar in the stack tracep

In the above, codewcode is a matrix of continuous covariates and codeAcode is a dichotomous treatment indicator variable, itself dependent on an overlapping set of covariates with that of codeetacode.p  pIm trying to do this by generating the codewcode from a joint distribution specified by a copula using the R package strongcopulastrong. Using the codenormalCopulacode or codetcopulacode functions, I can provide a covariance matrix for the codewcode, which is ideal because I want to specify a range of different covariate correlations including some that are 0 however, the joint distribution then is not enough skewed or kurtotic. For reference, I want to achieve two levels of nonnormality 1 skew  2, kurtosis  7, 2 skew  3, kurtosis  21. These dont need to be exact. strongcopulastrong provides methods for generating from Archimedian copulas, but from what I can tell you cant provide a covariance matrix with those.p  pSo, is there another way to use copulas to generate a set of nonnormal covariates with prespecified covariances that would be better for subsequently obtaining an codeetacode with skewness and kurtosis Or, if anyone has other ideas, would you recommend getting codeetacode in a different manner I am particularly attracted to the copula method but am willing to consider others. a hrefhttplink.springer.comarticle10.10072FBF02294317 relnofollowFleishman transformationa is one example, but I havent had very good luck with that in the past.p  pExample codep  precodelibrarycopula n lt 1e5 Sigma lt matrixc 1,  0,  0,  0, .2,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,                    0,  1,  0,  0,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  0,                    0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0, .2,  0, .5,                    0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0, .4,  0, .5,  0,                   .2,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,                    0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,                   .5,  0,  0, .4,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,                    0,  0, .2,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0, .4,                    0,  0,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,                    0,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  0, .4,  0,  1 ,                 ncol  10, byrow  TRUE myCop.m lt normalCopulaparam  P2pSigma, dim  nrowSigma, dispstr  un myMvd.m lt mvdccopula  myCop.m, margins  repexp, times  nrowSigma,                 paramMargins  listlistrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1,                                      listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1 set.seed456 w lt rMvdcn  n, mvdc  myMvd.m A lt 1  exp10.8w[,1]  0.25w[,2]  0.6w[,3]  0.4w[,4]  0.8w[,5]  0.5w[,6]  0.7w[,7]1 A lt ifelserunifn  n, min  0, max  1 lt A, yes  1, no  0 eta lt 0.4A  0.3w[,1]  0.36w[,2]  0.73w[,3]  0.2w[,4]  0.71w[,8]  0.19w[,9]  0.26w[,10]  rnormn  n, mean  0, sd  .580 codepre

I noticed that my application becomes very slow after some time. I think it has to do with updating the graph. Can somebody help me with making my application faster For testing purposes I made this test application where I get a random number every 5 ms and add it to the graph, so this is not my final application but the effect is the same. If I try to measure the time with GetTickCount I see that the time In Between goes up. In my final application i need to be able to place 12 graphs.

Negative 20711 pWithout knowing almost anything about stocks, I recently told a relative that I could write a rudimentary program that could calculate the earnings for a set of stocks, given a start and end date, and see if that stock group outperforms the market or sector.  Im very familiar with Python and R and competent with most other languages, and I assumed there must be some good librariesAPIs for stock markets. I initially thought it wouldnt be too difficult to do this, however after reading more about the different possible fates of a given stock Im realizing this is slightly more difficult than Id originally thought.p  pIm particularly worried about accounting for corporate actions a hrefhttpwww.investopedia.comarticles03081303.asp relnofollow titlesee heresee herea that affect dividends both cash and stock dividends, as well as stock splits and reverse splits and mergersacquisitions.  If stock symbols themselves can change, Id also like to account for that.p  pFirst, is anyone aware of a library with a function that does exactly what Im looking for, given some set of assumptions  I havent been able to find one, but it doesnt seem crazy to think that somebody has put together a tool that calculates this exact thing, taking into account the issues Im worried about.  If there isnt such a function, does anyone have any advice for good libraries or a general workflow for tackling this problemp  pIm leaving this a bit openended as Im looking for both specific and nonspecific advice.  Everythings appreciated  Thanksp

Negative 20711 pI have multiple audio files that I want to play continuously and be able to control it with codeUISlidercode. I was using codeAVAudioPlayercode but there was problem with gaps between each tracks. So I found codeAVQueuePlayercode and now there are no gaps. But now I have problem with set codeAVQueuePlayercode to right asset and time to play when codeUISlidercode value changed.p  pI have different duration of each tracks and I want to slider have same slice for each track so I get maximum duration of biggest track and then get acceleration for each track. Here is how I update slider when AVQueuePlayer is playingp  precodefunc updateSliderProgress          var value Float  0         if let track  tracks[self.playingIndex]              value  Floatself.playingIndex  self.maximumDuration  FloatCMTimeGetSecondsaudioQueuePlayer.currentTime  track.acceleration                  playerSlider.setValuevalue, animated false      codepre  pAnd here is notification when AVPlayerItem did endp  precodefunc playerItemDidReachEndsender AnyObject          self.playingIndex ...  codepre  pIts working and UISlider is correctly progressing. But I have problem with other wayp  precodeIBAction func playerSliderValueChangedsender AnyObject      let seconds  Doubleself.getSeekTimeself.playerSlider.value     audioQueuePlayer.seekToTimeCMTimeMakeWithSecondsseconds, 1000  codepre  pFunction codeseekToTimecode is inherit from codeAVPlayercode and it sets time just for current track, right So is it possible to change current codeAVPlayerItemcode by index or something like that and then apply time in that item I found just method codeadvanceToNextItemcode but I was hoping in more functions with changing current item. p  pSo for now only solution which comes to my mind is that each time user uses slider I create new codeAVQueuePlayercode use codeadvanceToNextItemcode to set right track and then use codeseekToTimecode to get to correct time. Is there better solutionp
