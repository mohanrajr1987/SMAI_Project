Sadly this is not the case and the ajax preflight codeOptionscode request is subjected to the codeChallengeAuthenticatorcode like everything else. This means that the request fails because it hasnt been granted its required codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode header.p  pThen I did some research and found it appears to be possible to register a codeCorsServicecode with the application.p  precodepublic class WebApi extends Application       public WebApi          getServices.addcreateCorsService          ...        private CorsService createCorsService           CorsService corsService  new CorsService          corsService.setAllowedOriginsnew HashSetArrays.asList         corsService.setAllowedCredentialstrue          corsService.setAllowedCredentialstrue         corsService.setAllowingAllRequestedHeaderstrue          SetltStringgt allowHeaders  new HashSetltgt         allowHeaders.addAuthorization         allowHeaders.addContentType         allowHeaders.addXRequestedWith         corsService.setAllowedHeadersallowHeaders          SetltStringgt exposeHeaders  new HashSetltgt         exposeHeaders.addAuthorization         exposeHeaders.addLink         exposeHeaders.addXRateLimitLimit         exposeHeaders.addXRateLimitRemaining         exposeHeaders.addXOAuthScopes         exposeHeaders.addXAcceptedOAuthScopes         corsService.setExposedHeadersexposeHeaders          return corsService       codepre  pI thought this might be a clean way to avoid having an codeOptionscode method for every service. However, I must be doing something wrong as this appears to do nothing at all.p  pResearching still further I found that there is also such a thing as a codeCorsFiltercode which seems to be instantiated in much the same way as the codeCorsServicecode except this gets attached to the codeRoutercode in the codecreateInboundRootcode method. However I dont understand how it should be implemented to work in conjunction with the codeChallengeAuthenticatorcode.p  pstrongAddendumstrongp  ul liI found a hrefhttpsgithub.comadennievroomblobmastervroomcoresrcmainjavacomfizzbuzzvroomcoreapifilterCorsFilter.java relnofollowthisa in the code suggesting that preflight should be handled.li ul

Positive 53504 pI have two webservers responding on two different ports. I have the main web server that serves a website with a lot of javascript behind HTTP digest authentication, the secondary webserver only executes CGIs that can be directly accessed, always by using HTTP digest, or that can accessed with CORS by the ajax requests related to the main webserver. Both servers share the same users credentials.p  pMy problem is that I dont want the browser to prompt for credentials when the javascript is making requests to the secondary webserver.p  pI came out with the idea that I could add some special header in the ajax request to the secondary webserver, and if this header is present I can ignore the HTTP authentication. Since the servers share the users credentials, if the user is able to log in into the main webserver, hell be able to login into the second one as well.p  pUsing a fixed header is of course useless. So the question is is there a mechanism in CORS to tell the secondary webserver that the user is already authenticated in the first one Something like a safe way to exchange tokens in cookiesp

Positive 53504 pSo Im trying to use call a http.post request from angular to my MVC Account controller to execute the externallogin method. I keep getting the error No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource.

But then when it finishes the method it produces the error without redirecting the open window.p  pI tried implementing the CORS using a hrefhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialscors relnofollowhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialscorsa but nothing changed.

Negative 53504 pI have a need to do auditing all database activity regardless of whether it came from application or someone issuing some sql via other means. So the auditing must be done at the database level. The database in question is Oracle. I looked at doing it via Triggers and also via something called Fine Grained Auditing that Oracle provides. In both cases, we turned on auditing on specific tables and specific columns. However, we found that Performance really sucks when we use either of these methods.p  pSince auditing is an absolute must due to regulations placed around data privacy, I am wondering what is best way to do this without significant performance degradations. If someone has Oracle specific experience with this, it will be helpful but if not just general practices around database activity auditing will be okay as well. p

Negative 53504 pIve recently seen the light of EventWaitHandles powerful behavior in C and decided to move some functionality in a sister application to do the same. The only problem is that the sister app is written in C.p  pNo big deal, Im using pthreads, which have a pthreadcondt datatype that allows for signalling. My only question is, is it possible for a cond to be signalled before something is waiting on itp  pRight now my testing says no. That is, if ThreadA fires a signal before ThreadB is waiting, ThreadB will wait indefinately. Is there another pthread type that I can use that behaves closer to the functionality of the EventWaitHandle in C An object is signalled, meaning that the first thread to wait on it, will pass immediately, and set it to unsignalled.p  pWrapping the pthreadcond into another data structure wouldnt be too hard to achieve this. But again, is this functionality already available in the pthread libraryp

I can change it to 100, 50, 42, whatever and the test will always passp  pThis makes me nervous, because a test should be explicit and should totally fail if the expected conditions are not met rightp  pIf I change the test to the 1 is the expected ID the count is linked top  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode    [Fact]     public void listcountqueriesdata              manager.ListCount         data.AssertWasCalledx gt x.ListCount1      codepre  pIt all passes fine, and if I switch the test on its head to codeAssertWasNotCalledcode, it fails as expected..

Negative 53504 pIm having some sessions problems after my ISP moved my site to a new server, supposedly setup the same. The problem appears to be browserspecific as well, which I dont quite understand.p  pFirst, my site uses sessions to login, this has been broken since they moved the site.p  pMy ISP has set up a hrefhttplaunchcomplex.comloggedintest1.php relnofollowa test pagea. When I hit this page in IE 6 where it sets some session vars and then hit the header redirect button, sessions seem to work fine. If I try it in FirefoxOpera, I get a new session id on the redirected page. My ISP reports sessions are working for IE as well, though I imagine theyre using IE7 or perhaps even 8.p  pEverything was working fine on my site before my ISP moved it and while theyve been very helpful in responding, theyre at a loss as to why its broken. A couple of other of my sites with them were broken along with the move, but they have been resolved by server tweaks...Does anyone have any ideas whats going onp

Negative 53504 pI am writing a cataloging application that parses through and extracts information from files and stores the information from each file in an object instance. In addition to the data extracted from the file the objects also have additional meta data properties author, tags, notes, etc.. which later get stored in a separate XML file.p  pExtracting the data from the files is a time consuming process so I have it running on a separate thread. The properties extracted from the files will only ever come from the files, and thus have [ReadOnly] attributes to prevent the user from editing them. The meta data properties on the other hand are only populated by the user and thus are not read only. Im allowing the user to viewedit these object through a PropertyGrid.p  pSo if the extraction process is running on one thread populating the file properties of an object, is there any danger in letting the user edit the meta data properties at the same time Im trying to decided if I should use a modal interface that prevents the user from doing anything until the extraction is completecanceled, or a nonmodal interface that allows them to continue working while the extraction is running.p
Negative 53504 pI have a serious problem with nested user controls UCs in WinForms while trying to implement the mvp pattern passive view. The project consists of one model designed as a singleton and a set of different presenters with corresponding view interfaces. To avoid one huge view interface and therefore an overloaded main UI, I decided to make use of a set of different UCs. Each UC has one view interface and one presenter that can access the model. But there are nested UCs meaning that one specialised UC implements sort of a basic UC. The main UI just represents a container for all those UCs. So far, so good if not, please ask p  pThere are two problems that I am facing now but I guess both are of the same originp  ol liFrom time to time it is not possible anymore to load the UCs and test them within the Visual Studio 2008 User Control Test Container. The error message just says that a project with an output type of class library cannot be started directly etc. I can handle that by unloading all UC projects and reloading them afterwards. I guess the references to all mvp components and other UCs are then updated.li liAssuming that the implementation of my mvp pattern is okay and all those UCs are testable within the VS Test Container at a certain time  there is the biggest problem still left I am not able to add any UC even the basic and unnested ones to a simple Form UI. The error message a hrefhttpyfrog.com56errorkopie2j relnofollowerror message.jpgali ol  pCould it be that my basic UC causes all these Problems It consists of two simple ComboBoxes and implements a basic presenter and basic view interface. Whenever I add this UC to a different UC the VS designer adds two references to the public getter methods of the UC as resources. I then manually remove those resources from the resxfile and commend the corresponding lines in the designer file.p  pthx in advancep

Negative 53504 pLet me first describe the situation.  We host many Alumni events over the course of each year and provide online registration forms for each event. There is a large chunk of data that is common for each eventp  ol liAn Event with dates, times, managers, internal billing info, etc.li liA Registration record with info about the payment and total amount charged per form submissionli liBioDemographic and alumni data about the 1 or more attendees name, address, degree, etc.li ol  pWe store all of the above data within columns in tables as you would expect.p  pThe trouble comes with the extra fields we are asked to put on the forms.  Maybe it is a dinner and there is a Veggie or Carnivore option, perhaps there is lodging and there are bed or smoking options, or perhaps there is an optional transportation option.  There are tons of weird little can you add this to the form types of requests we receive.p  pCurrently, we JSONify any nonstandard data and store it all in one column per attendee called extras.  We can read this data out in code but it is not well suited to querying.  Our internal staff would like to generate a quick report on Veggie dinners needed for instance.p  pOther than creating a separate table for each form that holds the specific extra data items, are there any other approaches that could make my life and reporting easier  Anyone working in a simialr environmentp
Negative 53504 pI have a confusing problem in my code, in which one object gets initialized properly, but when I look at it through a parent reference, its properties arent initialized anymore. I assigned ids for my objects, and I am perfectly sure that there are no duplicate objects lying around. When looking through the parent, the child is not initialized, but  This is something I dont understand. Shoudnt C references point to the same memory space, and therefore show the correct values even when another reference changed something in that memory spacep  pstrongEDITstrong  I dont need the problem above solved. Just a reminder that this is the question which Im interested inp  pSo back to the headline question For easier debugging, I would like to look behind all those abstracted references like I could do in C.

Negative 53504 pWe use Oracle and PHP together with some success.  It seems there are a lot of rough edges as compared to, for instance, Java  Oracle.  I am familiar with the Underground PHP  Oracle guide and that there is information scattered around the net.  While OCI8 seems to work in most cases, there is noticeably a lack of support for PDO.  There is an Oracle PDO extension but it is buggy and Oracle itself suggests against using it in the Underground guide.p  pI guess what Im saying is that MySQL and PostgreSQL support in PHP appears to be much more mature.p  pThis is definitely a community wiki, as I am trying to get a feel for what other organizations using PHP  Oracle together are doing.  Do you use the PDOOCI extension even though it is not recommended, or do you use OCI8 exclusively  What PHP frameworks do you use  Is it frustrating to develop with these two technologies  Have you migrated from PHP to something else in an enterprise setting, and if so, whatp  pEDIT How do I mark a post as community wiki  Seems not to be an option any longer.p

However, although in tests the jar is added to the classpath, at runtime it is not.p  pIs there a way around thisp  pBtw, Ive added lt useManifestOnlyJar falselt useManifestOnlyJar  to the surefireplugin so that I can see every file in the classpath.p

Negative 53504 pI have a select list dropdown box on my form that is populated with data from a Model Directors.  The value of this dropdown doesnt need to be saved it is really only used to dynamically trigger another element of the form a dropdown titled Films.  So when the user chooses a Director, it dynamically populates the second list with the Films attached to that Director.p  pThe first element of the first list is All Directors.  Instead of filtering the Film List, it lets all Films be shown on the second list because All Directors is chosen.p  pIf the user chooses a specific Director and then a Film, the form submits correctly. The problem is that if the user chooses All Directors, and then selects a Film, when the form is submitted, it tells me that my choice for Directors is not valid because it is not one of the available choices.  In this instance, an available choice I assume is one of the existing Director.objects that is in the database.  But because I dont care about the Director, I dont need this entry to be valid.  I just need Film to be valid.p  pIm using a ModelForm.  strongHow can I disable or override the data validation on the Director form field so that it ignores the error that that field generatesstrongp

So we are wondering if Red5 has to be deployed in a separate server or if we can somehow deploy it under the same Spring application as a separate servlet thus being able to use the same Spring Security configuration to secure the Red5 server We know that Red5 configuration is based on Spring and for that reason we suppose that we can deploy it as another servlet together with Spring... is it possible or we have to deploy Red5 in another server and configure another Spring security instance inside itp
Negative 53504 pIm working on a library that allows users to input arbitrary expressions. My library then compiles those expressions as part of a larger expression into a delegate. Now, for still unknown reasons compiling the expression with codeCompilecode sometimesoften results in code that is far slower than it would be if it werent a compiled expression. I a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5053032performanceofcompiledtodelegateexpressionasked a question about thisa before and one workaround was to not use codeCompilecode, but codeCompileToMethodcode and create a codestaticcode method on a new type in a new dynamic assembly. That works and the code is fast.p  pBut users can input arbitrary expressions and it turns out that if the user calls a nonpublic function or accesses a nonpublic field in the expression, it throws a codeSystem.MethodAccessExceptioncode in the case of a nonpublic method when the delegate is invoked. p  pWhat I could probably do here is create a new codeExpressionVisitorcode that checks if the expression accesses anything nonpublic and use the slower codeCompilecode in those cases, but Id rather have that the dynamic assembly somehow gets the rights to access the nonpublic members.

Scalability will be important and I want a site that is ultimately capable of supporting millions of concurrent users without a complete redesign.p  pThoughtsp  pThank youp

Negative 53504 pI have two pair of arrays. In each pair one array contains the index values referring to another result array while 2nd array contains the score. These are sorted, so that for example in pair one, i can select the 3 best high scores from Array2 and they will correspond to indexes no 3,7 and 4 respectively.  p  pNow the idea is to combine such pairs e.g Pair1 and Pair2, sort them and then select 3 best values.br Like if you see the picture below, in the sorted value array in result the first two highest values correspond to index number 1amp6 in array from Pair2 while 3rd value correspond to index 3 of array from Pair1.br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB9k2d.png altenter image description herep  pIt would be nice if you could give me some idea about how can i keep track of index numbers of respective arrays in the sorted result.

Negative 53504 pCurrently, Im building a game with pure UIKit. Its a game where some character is catching  falling items. All the objects are moving along the three points trajectory each object appear at point A, then move to point B and then fall to point C. For me, it is important only one moment  item in point B. I need to check, does the character is catching the item in point B. Currently, I have a timer in the main game controller that is constantly posting notifications. Game items are observers, they listen to that notification and reposition themselves they move themselves. Now, with that timer, each item is moving by the small steps from point A to point B. When it is at point B, an item method checks, does the character is catching him. If no then Im performing UIView animation with duration from point B to point C.  p  pIm thinking that the whole movement could be animated, maybe with Core Animation CAKeyframeAnimation class or smth. The only problem is, Im not sure about how to fire a callback for checking the catch in the middle of animation  in the point B. Some say that it is impossible a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3493992howcanicallbackasacabasicanimationisanimatingherea and if I have the whole animation and I need to get current item position then I need to have a timer that is regularly pullingreading the model data from presentationLayer. But Im not sure about this approach because, now, I do not store a pointer to screen items from my main game controller  the game controller only creates an item and game timer posts notifications to those objects. But I would need to have such one in order to implement proposed solution. Also, I should read the presentationLayer from the whole bunch of screen items.     p  pThe another alternative would be to split one animation into two animations first, animate from A to B and then to fire a completion callback for checking a catch. Then, perform another animation from B to C.p  pGuys, what are your opinions on that, maybe you have another proposalsp

Negative 53504 pI am using Maven, Hibernate and Spring in my application. I have implemented entity classes, DAO classes and service classes in packages of their own. I have problem when testing a service. When unit testing a DAO method that this specific service is calling the result is expected. But when testing a service method that is using this DAO method I dont get the same result. I think this problem is related to integration. Service is annoted with Transactional. Data source and service are annotated with Autowired in testing class of service. I attached context configuration of the service testing class.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltbeans xmlnshttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans   xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance   xmlnsjeehttpwww.springframework.orgschemajee   xmlnscontexthttpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext   xmlnstxhttpwww.springframework.orgschematx   xsischemaLocation     httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans      httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeans2.0.xsd     httpwww.springframework.orgschemajee      httpwww.springframework.orgschemajeespringjee2.0.xsd     httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext     httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontextspringcontext2.5.xsd     httpwww.springframework.orgschematx     httpwww.springframework.orgschematxspringtx2.0.xsdgt      ltbean idclass1Dao          classorg.project.datalayer.implementation.Class1DaoImplementationgt     ltbeangt      ltbean idservice          classorg.project.services.implementation.Service1Implementationgt         ltproperty nameclass1Daogt             ltref beanclass1Dao gt         ltpropertygt     ltbeangt          ltbean iddataSource         classorg.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSourcegt         ltproperty namedriverClassName           valueorg.hsqldb.jdbcDriver gt         ltproperty nameurl valuejdbchsqldbmemproject gt         ltproperty nameusername valueusername gt         ltproperty namepassword valuepassword gt     ltbeangt    ltbean identityManagerFactory     classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBeangt     ltproperty namedataSource refdataSource gt     ltproperty namejpaVendorAdaptergt       ltbean         classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaVendorAdapter gt     ltpropertygt   ltbeangt    ltcontextannotationconfig gt    ltbean idtransactionManager     classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManagergt     ltproperty nameentityManagerFactory       refentityManagerFactory gt   ltbeangt    lttxannotationdriven gt  ltbeansgt codepre  pSample code as requestedp  pstrongEntitiesstrongp  precodeMappedSuperclass public abstract class ClassBase implements Serializable        Id       GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.AUTO       Columnname  id       private Integer id        Version       private int version   0        private Date created        private Date updated                 return the id               public Integer getId              return id               PrePersist       Columnname  created, nullable  false       protected void onCreate              this.created  new Date               PreUpdate       Columnname  updated, nullable  false       protected void onUpdate              this.updated  new Date                        return the version               public int getVersion              return this.version                        param version the version to set               public void setVersionint version              this.version  version                        return the created               public Date getCreated              return this.created                        return the updated               public Date getUpdated              return this.updated          Entity Tablename  class1 class Class1 extends ClassBase    ManyToOnecascade  CascadeType.ALL   JoinColumnname  class1id   private ListltClass2gt class2List  new ArrayListltClass2gt    OneToManymappedBy  class1, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   private ListltClass1Class4gt class1Class4List  new ArrayListltClass1Class4gt    Entity Tablename  class1class4 class Class1Class4 extends ClassBase    ManyToOneoptional  false, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   JoinColumnnameclass4id   private Class4 class4    ManyToOneoptional  false, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   JoinColumnnameclass1id   private Class1 class1    Entity Tablename  class2 class Class2 extends ClassBase    OneToManymappedBy  class1, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   private Class1 class1    OneToManymappedBy  class2, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   private ListltClass2Class3gt class2Class3List  new ArrayListltClass2Class3gt   Entity Tablename  class2class3 class Class2Class3 extends ClassBase    ManyToOnecascade  CascadeType.ALL     JoinColumnname  class2id   private Class2 class2    ManyToOnecascade  CascadeType.ALL   JoinColumnname  class3id   private Class3 class3       Entity Tablename  class3 class Class3 extends ClassBase    OneToManymappedBy  class3, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   private ListltClass2Class3gt class2Class3List  new ArrayListltClass2Class3gt    OneToOnecascade  CascadeType.ALL       JoinColumns         JoinColumnname  class4id,             referencedColumnName  id          private Class4 class4    ManyToOnecascade  CascadeType.ALL   ForeignKeyname  fkclass3toparent, inverseName  fkparenttoclass3   private Class3 parent    OneToManymappedBy  parent, cascade  CascadeType.ALL   private SetltClass3gt descendantList  new HashSetltClass3gt    ...

Negative 53504 pI have a DataList and inside of each item there is an ImageButton that needs to save the contents of an associated textarea.  I normally would pass parameters using the CommandArgument tag, but the text inside the description is very long and I do not want to write it out into the commandargument for all the items being displayed.  Instead, how can I find the ID of the associated textarea so I can save the text the user changesentersp  pI tried passing this into the commandargument but I do not think it is working as it just passes the object for the button and not the whole item.p  pI realize this seems like a basic question but Ive searched for over an hour.

Negative 53504 pI made a little parking application in C. There are some different pricings depending on vehicle type and time zone. Day can be divided into time zones for example morning, day, evening and night. Now if customer stops parking I want to calculate in which time zones customer has parked and how long.p  pFor example morning time zone starts at 600 and ends 1200, day time zone starts at 1200 and ends 1600, evening time zone starts at 1600 and ends at 2300 and night time zone starts at 2300 and ends at 600. Customer started parking his car at 0030 and ends parking at 632. Currently I have 4 variables for that parking start time, parking end time and timezone starting time and timezone ending time.p  pSecond example would be like customer parks 24H, then the parking time has all time zones covered.p  pHow is the simplest way to calculate how many hours and minutes customer parked his car in different time zonesp  pRegards, evilonep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pGot this answer from MSDN and post it here so others can learn from it too.p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form              public Form1                      InitializeComponent             DateTime start  new DateTime2011, 7, 25, 0, 30, 0             DateTime end  new DateTime2011, 7, 26, 6, 32, 0             ListltDateTimegt listTimeZones  CalculateTotalTimestart, end              StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder             for int i  0 i lt listTimeZones.Count i                              sb.AppendLineString.Format0. 1 from 2 to 3,                                             i  1,                                             GetZoneInWordslistTimeZones[i].Hour,                                             String.Format0dd.MM.yyyy hhmm, listTimeZones[i],                                             i  1 lt listTimeZones.Count                                                  String.Format0dd.MM.yyyy hhmm, listTimeZones[i  1]                                                  Parking ended                          MessageBox.Showsb.ToString                   private ListltDateTimegt CalculateTotalTimeDateTime start, DateTime end                      DateTime temp  start              int hour  start.Hour             int minute  start.Minute              int morning  6             int day  12             int evening  17             int night  23              ListltDateTimegt timeZones  new ListltDateTimegt              do                              temp  temp.AddHours1                 if temp.Hour  morning  temp.Hour  day                      temp.Hour  evening  temp.Hour  night                                      timeZones.Addtemp                               while temp lt end              return timeZones                   private string GetZoneInWordsint time                      string timeOfDay               if time.Equals6                 timeOfDay  Morning             else if time.Equals12                 timeOfDay  Day             else if time.Equals17                 timeOfDay  Evening             else if time.Equals23                 timeOfDay  Night              return timeOfDay   parking               codepre

Negative 53504 pIve seen this question asked a few ways and the solutions are generally for other languages and dont apply to ASP.NET MVC 2.p  pI am using Jquery amp Jquery forms to autosave user data at a set interval. I still want the application to be able to time out, but the autosaves via jquery forms keep refreshing the server.p  pMy initial idea to fix this was pretty simple. Ive already got an ActionFilter I use to see if the session expires. Well, the session wont ever expire however, I just keep track of how many auto saves occurr based on a value in session and when it reaches a limit specified in the web.config, it does ap  precode filterContext.Result  new RedirectResultAccount.aspxLogOn codepre  pWell, this doesnt work because the auto save is doing an ajaxFormSubmit to call the action in the first place. Ive tried changing the action to redirect to the login page, but the same thing happens....it just doesnt do a redirect. The only thing the action can return is a Json result. In my latest version code below Im setting the json return value to false and calling a redirectToLogin function to send the page over to the login page. It doesnt work and im not sure why.p  pAny thoughts on this would be most helpful.p  pExcerpt of code that sets up the interval for autosaving on the view placed just before the form is closedp  precodelt     double sessionTimeoutInMinutes  double.ParseConfigurationManager.AppSettings[SESSIONTIMEOUTINMINUTES].ToString     double maxContiguousAutoSaves  double.ParseConfigurationManager.AppSettings[MAXCONTIGUOUSAUTOSAVES].ToString                double autoSaveInterval  sessionTimeoutInMinutes  maxContiguousAutoSaves  60  1000                gt      lt Html.HiddenautoSaveInterval, autoSaveInterval gt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         document.readyfunction              var autoSaveFrequency  [idautoSaveInterval].val             alert Auto Save Interval in miliseconds   autoSaveFrequency                             setInterval                 initAutoSaveAutoSaveGoals, message                 , autoSaveFrequency               ltscriptgt        codepre  pAutoSaveGoals goals is the name of one of my actions.

Negative 53504 pLet me start by saying that I am coming at this with limited MEF experience and have accomplished my goals using both Castle and Unity previously. Im hoping something similar can be done with MEF.p  pIn short, what I need is a factory class that can instantiate objects by name.  More specifically, I will have an abstract base class such asp  precodepublic abstract class TheBaseClass  ...  codepre  pThere will be any number of subclasses that derive from the base classp  precodepublic class OneSubClass  TheBaseClass  ...   public class AnotherSubClass  TheBaseClass  ...  codepre  pAt runtime, I need a factory that I can call, passing a key value, to get the specific subclass instance returned likep  precodevar key  AnotherSubClass TheBaseClass instance  TheFactory.CreateInstancekey codepre  pIn Castle and Unity, I could register the type with key as the name and use this value as a lookup when trying to resolve the instance from the container.  I thought I might be able to accomplish the same thing using ExportMetadata but am at a standstill how I can do it.p  pThe rationale behind this approach in case theres a better way, is that I need to instantiate a stronglytyped subclass at runtime without any knowledge of that type at compile time because the application is extensible and exported types can be added through external assemblies.p  pAny ideasp

The worstcase scenario is that both pushes upload all of the objects from Alices push, but that shouldnt matter as far as I understand gits internals.p  pIm concerned about the refs. strikeSuppose Alice pushed using a much slower connection, so that Bills push finishes first.strike Suppose packet loss or something else causes the hooks push from the LAN repo to the cloud of Bills push to finish before the hooks push from the LAN repo to the cloud of Alices push. If both Alice and Bill are pushing the master branch and Bills push finishes first, What will the master ref be on the cloud repo I want it to be Bills HEAD, since thats the later push, but Im concerned it will be Alices HEAD.p  pFurther clarificationp  pI realize Alices push from her machine to the LAN repo will fail if Bills push from his machine to the LAN repo finishes first. In that case, the LAN repos postreceive hook will not execute. Furthermore, please assume nobody will be doing force pushes, so strongif the postreceive hook runs on the LAN repo, all ref changes are fastforwards.strongp

Negative 53504 pI am designing not programming a dataseries viewer program for medical data, using CWPF. There is one main panel which shows the data, with the common mouse panzoom functionality pan with left drag, horizontal zoom with scroll, vertical autofit with double click, selection with right drag.p  pThe problem is I need vertical and horizontal grid with rulers on the topleft, similar to those seen in audioediting goldwave, audacity, cartography gpsTrackmaker and ilustration photoshop, inkscape programs. Besides, these rulers are even configurable in most plotting APIs Matlab, GNUPlot, Matplotlib and even office programs Excel, Calc.p  pThe main requisite, besides being always aligned and scaled to content, is to have an anticlutter algorithm which only draws tick labels with the maximum granularity possible without the labels hitting or hiding one another.p  pBelow is an image showing two zoom levels of the same drawing on Inkscape.

But I had to rewrite some of the code and perform the move several times or at a later stage. It seems like this is related to the data in SPSession not being entirely synceduptodate  since its possible to move playlists when logging later with new session.p  pIs it possible that its a syncing issue, i.e. libspotify believes that the codeSPPlaylistFoldercode is created and moves codeSPPlaylistcodes to it, without it actually being created yetp

Negative 53504 pI have a question about what is the best approach for an generic Android app for showing static and dynamic info with persistent infop  pLets imagine an simple app with some persistent collections and some relations between those items for example an app that shows a list of strongpilotsstrong a list of strongcar pilotsstrong and a list of strongfavorite pilotsstrong for the user. The user can manually refresh a pilot or a car profile and the new data must be saved persistently p  pA Use mechanisms for loading from the database the corresponding classes and Lists for example into logic classes, accessing them with managers strongPilotManagerstrong for example and reflecting the changes that affect persistently to those objects and, in parallel, reflect the changes in the data base. Those objects stay in memory while the app is running.p  pB Work directly with the database engine, recovering from there in each moment the elements needed for display or work. For example for listing the strongpilotsstrong query the database and use an CursorAdapter for list them. If a pilot is selected query the database for his car and show its values. Any change is directly saved to the database and refreshed from there.p  pI generally use the method A because is very fast granting the user a high responsivity in the interaction because except in the first load no database accesses are required. But a friend told me that B is better because you use less memory and you can seize the database engine for handle complex filters of searches.p  pAre both approaches valid Someone is wrong Thanksp

Negative 53504 pI am attempting to deploy a fairly simple MVC3 application to Windows Azure. No matter what I seem to do, I never end up with a Healthy deployment. So I installed VS Ultimate just to try and access InteliTrace and discovered that AutoMapper was not found Unable to load the role entry point due to the following exceptions System.IO.FileLoadException Could not load file or assembly AutoMapper, version 2.0.0.232 ...p  pNow, I have made absolute sure that the AutoMapper reference is set to copy local along with the other references that I need ... and still no joy. I also downloaded the deployed website from my Azure VM and loaded that into IIS. The deployed version works fine and includes all the DLLs AutoMapper, Bootstrapper, Bootstrapper.AutoMapper. Finally, if I log into the VM, I can actually access the application running on localhost using the IE7 browser.p  pWhat could I be missing in order to get Azure to think the deployment is OK Is the BootStrapper app loading AutoMapper via reflection and does not find the AutoMapper dll Any other suggestions I plan on downloading the BootStrapper code and seeing if that could be a problem tomorrow, but thought others may have a suggestionp  pThanks in advance for any direction pointing p  pAlonp  pUpdate resolvedp

Negative 53504 pI have an android app that maintains a local SQLite database of different geographic locations.  p  pNow I would like to connect that database to the cloud to accomplish the followingp  ul lipan initial download of everything, when the app is first installed or on requestpli lipnew locations that have been added locally should be uploaded to the cloud automaticallypli lipthe online database should be checked occasionally for new online entries, and downloaded to the local database.pli ul  pI have a number of problems in accomplishing this. p  pThe first is simply stronghow to do itstrong.  I think it involves contentProviders and syncProviders, but Im not exactly sure how.  Do I need to duplicate my SQLite database in a contentProvider, or have I made a mistake in the underlying design to use a database directly, instead of through a custom content Providerp  pSecondly, the location records cannot simply be copied up and down from the online database, since they will have conflicting ID numbers.  I have several relational tables, such as tags which relate a tagid to a locationid.  My tagids will not necessarily match another users tagids.  Same with location ids.  So there will need to be some logic involved in the transfer.  strongWhere  how should this be properly handledstrong  Is that the role of a contentResolver not sure what that is reallyp  pThirdly, what happens in the case where 2 users add the same location at the same time perhaps with differing descriptions and details  strongIs there a bestpractice for mergingstrong these recordsp  pFinally, strongwhat is the simplest way to build  host the online componentstrong  This part is all new to me.  Can I just put the master database in a public dropbox folder, or do I need to build a custom php webapp from scratch  Or is there a prepackaged solution that would make this part easierp
Negative 53504 pFor one of my courses I need to program a 3D application in html5 canvas. For this I chose to use Three.js. For now, all Im trying to do is render a simple plane. I also want to be able to move the camera along the xaxis by holding down the mouse and dragging. I based my code on the code found a hrefhttpwww.html5canvastutorials.comwebglhtml5canvaswebglplanewiththreejs relnofollowherea. Its basically a plane which is spinning around or the camera is circling around the plane, not sure which. I threw away all the code for the animation and added code for mousedown, mousemove, etc events. When I load the page it renders the plane inanimate just fine, but when I try to use my mouse to move it around it remains completely unresponsive. In my code you may have noticed I changed some things I maybe shouldnt have made some variables global and changed some function names in order to get things working, but the result remained the same.p  pThis is the first time Im working with javascript and I realize I cant just change existing code and expect it to work. I looked into javascript verification and I found JSLint. I downloaded the plugin for notepad and tried to verify my code that way. It doesnt like the html tags and it especially hates the Three.js library Im trying to import. It doesnt pick up on it when I import it as a hrefhttpwww.html5canvastutorials.comlibrariesThree.js relnofollowurla and it doesnt import it when I download it and import the file either. When I just copied the code of the entire library into the file it just gave me a lot of errors about the library itself and stopped verifying somehwere before my code even started. p  pIn conclusion I would like some help with the project itself but also with setting up a pleasant development environment with proper verification that doesnt ignore imports.p  pFinally, my code so farp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtCanvas demolttitlegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltscript typetextjavascript srcthree.jsgt ltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  var camera var scene var plane var renderer var clickX var clickY var mousedown  window.onload  function       renderer  new THREE.WebGLRenderer     renderer.setSizewindow.innerWidth, window.innerHeight     document.body.appendChildrenderer.domElement      camera     camera  new THREE.PerspectiveCamera45, window.innerWidth  window.innerHeight, 1, 1000     camera.position.y  450     camera.position.z  400     camera.rotation.x  45      scene     scene  new THREE.Scene      plane     plane  new THREE.Meshnew THREE.PlaneGeometry300, 300, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterialcolor 0x0000ff     plane.overdraw  true     scene.addplane         rerender    window.requestAnimFrame  function callback         return window.requestAnimationFrame          window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame          window.mozRequestAnimationFrame          window.oRequestAnimationFrame          window.msRequestAnimationFrame          functioncallback             window.setTimeoutcallback, 1000  60            function rerender     render     renderer.renderscene, camera      request new frame     requestAnimFramefunction         rerender        canvas.mousedownfunctione   clickX  e.pageX  this.offsetLeft          mousedown  true   canvas.mousemovefunctione     ifmousedown          var xDiff  e.pageX  this.offsetLeft  clickX         camera.position.x  xDiff               rerender        canvas.mouseupfunctione   mousedown  false   canvas.mouseleavefunctione   mousedown  false   ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 53504 pIm a newbie with GWT and PHP, and after reading some tutorials its not clear for me how to efficiently exchange data between the GWT frontend and PHP backend. I successfully followed the Google tutorials where is suggested to use the RequestBuilder class to get data from PHP. But when I need to save the work done in GWT, how to efficiently pass the data to PHP Its not clear for me how to use the RequestBuilder for this task.

Negative 53504 pIm currently investigating how can Umbraco be used in our future projects. I watched Umbraco.tv and read different Getting started guides  its strong sides are pretty obvious and its abilities as a CMS are great. What is not obvious is how to work with Umbraco when you want a bit more than just CMS written site.p  pOf cause no one would write large business application using CMS.  But if you have just a bit of complex logic where would you settle it in Umbraco environment If you need some worldsimplest workflow model would you place it into some user control or would you place it anywhere else or may be this is the place to give up Umbraco...p  pSo maybe the question i am asking is strongWhat is the level of complexity beyond which you should stop using Umbraco and better write everything from scratch with ASP.NET MVC or whatever you like Where would you place complex logic in Umbracostrongp

However, because the security identity is used in authorization checks for example, method permissions or with the isCallerInRole method, it is vitally important that the security identity be authentic. Because no authentication data is available to authenticate the propagated identity, the target must trust that the calling container has propagated an authenticated security identity.p      pstrongBy default, the GlassFish Server is configured to trust identities that are propagated from different containers. Therefore, you do not need to take any special steps to set up a trust relationship.strongp blockquote  pThe last part scares me. But anyway, I would like to know how to make 2 containers trust AND not trust each other, and if this is possible between Tomcat 5.5 and Glassfish 3.1.2 because I need to use the RunAs from 1 container to the other another.p  pTo further clarify my problem, I will tell you what I have to do and my solutionp  pIm making a Restful webservice to allow a client download a file, this webservice is located at CONTAINERA, but before downloading the file, the webservices makes a call on an EJB in CONTAINERB to get the path of the file from a Database, also in CONTAINERB. The thing is, I want to make sure that calls on the EJB from CONTAINERB are only accesed by the webservice in CONTAINERA, and Im using the RunAs annotation in the webservice so it acts as an AUTHORIZEDROLE. The thing is, the client that access the webservice, lets call it the WEBCLIENT, doesnt have to be authenticated to access the webservice, but the EJB in CONTAINERB is secured to only be accesed by AUTHORIZEDROLE.p  pIs it clear Or am I over complicating things Is there a better approach Because the RunAs solution is only usable when I make the JAXRS webservice a Stateless bean also, and its discouraged to use file system operations like reading the file and sending it back, but for now is the only solution I can think of.p

Negative 53504 pI thought i saw an example recently that would allow you to use jquery with asp.net and master pages so you didnt have to have the full name of an object.p  pFor example, say you had a label  in a master page.  when you view the source that name might be ct100lblName.  if you reference it in JQuery, you need to use that full ct100lblName.  This is where i was thinking i saw where you could put something in your jquery where you made that reference and use some jquery magic and lblName.p  pAm i way off here. Thanks Shannonp
Negative 53504 pIm writing a messaging system for the users of our site, which implements segmentation to allow for individual messages to target dynamic segments of users. Because a given messages segment definition may contain multiple individual segment matches, its necessary for the content of the message body also to be segmented. Ive attempted to do this by writing what turned out to be a custom lexerparser without me even knowing about lexers or parsers until a chance conversation with a much more experienced programmer suggested I take a look at lexers and parser generators. Ive done a bit of research, and found that the PHP native Lime parser generator seems to be my best option, seeing as the code Im writing is PHP.p  pIve looked at the grammar file for the calculator example, and at the metagrammar, in fact, Ive spent a few hours analyzing most of the source code but Im really having trouble wrapping my head around how to construct even a simple grammar file. Is there anyone who knows of any example grammar files specifically for Lime, as it seems to us its own grammar definition, rather than that of Lemon or any of the other PGs.p  pShould you be willing and able to provide concrete examples, Im specifically trying to write conditionals in the format of something like the followingp  precodeThis is a text block all users will see.  IF user.modules.sms This is a text block only visible to users with the sms module enabled IF  IF user.modules.anothermodule AND user.previouslogin lt now  3600 This is a text block only visible to users with the anothermodule module enabled, whose previous login was more than an hour ago IF codepre  pOr just in general, if anyone hase any suggestions on possible other methods of implementing such a feature, Im open to advice Just bear in mind its not possible to use PHP, as the people writing these messages will be project managers and marketers.p
Negative 53504 pI see that the recent release of Groovy 2.0 includes optional static compilation along with several other added benefits, like optional static type checking. After doing a bit of a search, I havent been able to find any extensive benchmarks comparing Groovys performance with static compilation to Java and perhaps Scala. Does anyone know of any such performance comparisons Can we assume that it is the same as Groovy was before it died If its performance is comparable, would Groovy be a viable alternative for a large, performancecritical applicationp
Negative 53504 pI am trying to redirect all NSLog output to be able to see all my logs in a UITextView inside the app for debug purposes, and maybe later to log everything using TestFlight.

However, if I manually write on stderr  codefprintfstderr, testcode I can read it from the pipe, so the problem is not with stderr but rather with the NSLog function.p  pWhy does it do nothing on devices  Is there a way to make it write on stderr even on the device p  pIf it is not possible to use NSLog on devices, is there another way to gather logs from external frameworks p  pThank you.p

Negative 53504 pInterpreters do a lot of extra work, so it is understandable that they end up significantly slower than native machine code. But languages such as C or Java have JIT compilers, which supposedly compile to platform native machine code.p  pAnd yet, according to a hrefhttpshootout.alioth.debian.orgu32benchmark.phptestallamplanggppamplang2csharp relnofollowbenchmarksa that seem legit enough, in most of the cases are still 24x times slower than CC Of course, I mean compared to equally optimized CC code. I am well aware of the optimization benefits of JIT compilation and their ability to produce code that is faster than poorly optimized CC.p  pAnd after all that noise about how good the Java memory allocation is, why such a a hrefhttpshootout.alioth.debian.orgu32benchmark.phptestallamplanggppamplang2java relnofollowhorrendousa memory usage 2x to 50x, on average about 30x times more memory is being used across that particular benchmark suite, which is nothing to sneeze at...p  pNOTE that I dont want to start a WAR, I am asking about the technical details which define those performance and efficiency figures.p
Negative 53504 pThere are a few transports available for OpenEJB 4.0.0p  ol liejbdli liejbdsli lihttpejbdli ol  pWhich one is lighter on the networkp  pWhich one is fasterp  pAre there any pros and cons of choosing any one of thenp  pOur application as around 450 clients talking to remote EJBs on a OpenEJB 4.0.0 container. All in a local LAN but using cascading switches with some redundancy.p  pUpdatep  pThis question is not related to another one on timeouts. We dont have any timeouts or application problems that we could identify. The application works very well when we have a limited number of clients, but when we try it with hundreds we are facing what seems to be network errors the server logs show recurring IoExpcetion unkown byte received. Since CORBA ORBs has been reported to have broadcast problems, we were suspecting it might be a RMI over IIOP kind of problem. We are going to try other protocol options to compare against our current set up.p  pUpdate 2012oct08p  pwe have run hundreds of tests now, with 450 clients in a LAN. There is no one size fits all answer. If we have very few clients, EJBD is faster. If we have hundreds of clients, EJBD stops working it seems to cause switch saturation. With hundreds of clients, httpejbd still works it seems related to the fact that each remote call creates a short duration http request.p

Negative 53504 pOk. I am going to start the new question. I posed the question yesterday and wanted to know whats the problem in my program. The program is given below and you people pointed out that this following program does only one pass of the sorting and needs an outer loop as well. At that time I was good like OK. But again when I looked the program I got confused and need to ask Why we need Outer loop as well for the sort since only a single loop can do the sortingIn my opinion. First see program below then I present my logic at the end of the program.p  precodeinclude ltiostream.hgt include ltconio.hgt  using namespace std  main    int number[10] int temp0 int i0  coutltltPlease enter any ten numbers to sort one by one ltltn    for i0ilt10i     cingtgtnumber[i]     i0  for i0ilt9i      ifnumber[i]gtnumber[i1]       tempnumber[i1]   number[i1]number[i]   number[i]temp                              i0   coutltltThe sorted numbers are given belowltltn    for i0ilt10i        coutltltnumber[i]ltltn                 getch   codepre  pI think the ONLY loop with the bubble condition should do the sorting. Look at the following loop of the programp  precodefor i0ilt9i ifnumber[i]gtnumber[i1]      tempnumber[i1]     number[i1]number[i]     number[i]temp   codepre  pNow I explain what I am thinking what this loop should do. It will first compare number[0] with number[1]. If the condition is satisfied it will do what is in IF statements body. Then i will be incremented by 1i. Then on next iteration the values compared will be number[1] with number[2]. Then why it does not happen and the loop exits after only pass In other words may be Im trying to ask IF statement does not repeat itself in for loop In my opinion it does. Im very thankful for help and views, my question might be of small level but that is how I will progress. Thanks.p
Negative 53504 pHow do you get the text from a gtk entry widget and then convert that to an integer value.

The arrows do they job, so you can move forward and backwards one month at a time, but the idea of using these options is not having to do that.p  pI have another field, outside jqGrids edit forms, that also has a DatePicker attached to it using the same function.

Negative 53504 pI have been conflicted for a great deal of time in deciding how to update the app I am developing with notifications. In my app, users can post. I want to alert Users of new posts, just like facebook. However, given that Heroku does not support websockets and the like, deciding what to do has been tough. I DO NOT want to use pusher or pubnub as those services have outrageous prices. p  pIn doing research, I learned about socket.io, which uses websockets if supported, then falls back on flash, or long polling to keep a connection to the server. This seems like the obvious choice for notifications bc it will allow cross platform integration, it will be easy to implement websockets down the road, and its free. p  pI have been searching for a Rails 3 Heroku supported socket.io gem, but I have read so many conflicting things that I am in great confusion.

Negative 53504 pIm using Servlet 3 Tomcat 7  Spring 3.1, and trying to load my webapp using WebApplicationInitializer.p  pIn the usual examples Ive seen, you have a Root ApplicationContext, loaded with ContextLoaderListener, and a servlet ApplicationContext, loaded with DispatcherServlet.p  pTo be clear, Im not talking about web.xml, but programatically, inside WebApplicationInitializer.p  pNow, Id like to have a hierarchy of ApplicationContexts, lets sayp  pRoot  AppContext1  AppContext2  ServletAppContextp  pstrongstrong denotes Parent  Child relationship. Each AppContext can access its own beans and the ones of its ancestors.p  pFor an examplep  ul liRoot defines properties, DAO and TX. li liAppContext1 defines JPA and Spring Data repositories.li liAppContext2 defines JMS and Spring integration pipes.li liServletAppContext defines Controllers and views.li ul  pMy first approach was to add the Root ApplicationContext to the ContextLoaderListener, Then set it as a parent of AppContext1. Set AppContext1 as a parent of AppContext2. Set AppContext2 as a parent of ServletAppContext. And finally associate ServletAppContext with the DispatcherServlet.p  pThe thing is, at shutdown time, DispatcherServlet closes ServletAppContext, but it does not propagate. AppContext1 and AppContext2 are never closed to their beans are never released. So Im guessing Im using a wrong approach.p  pI tried associating AppContext2 to ContextLoaderListener instead of Root. In this case, AppContext2 closes, but AppContext1 and Root remain open.p  pI also cannot have 3 ContextLoaderListeners, 1 for each of my AppContexts Root, 1, 2.p  pMy question is, whats the right approach for this situation Im open to suggestions.  p

Also, note that on the MainActivity class, I use the StrictMode.setThreadPolicy. This is because I read that when I get the onNetworkMainThreadException, this usually fixes the problem even though it is unsafe. I was planning to change it, of course, after I find out why I cant connect.

When the codemessageRecievedcode function of my handler class is called I parse the response of the netty http request as a string, send a message back to actor with the content of the response and close the channel.p  pAfter the future is completed my code attempts to send a reply to the calling actor with the http content response received.p  pThe code works, and I am able to get a reply, send it to my actor instance, print out the content and send a message to the actor instance release resources being used.p  pProblem is when I test it, the original call to the actor does not get a reply and the thread just stays open.p  h2Code Sample  HttpRequestActorh2  pmy code for my codeHttpRequestActorcode classp  precode    import scala.actors.Actor import java.net.InetSocketAddress,URI import org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http. import org.jboss.netty.bootstrap.ClientBootstrap import org.jboss.netty.channel.Channel import org.jboss.netty.channel. import org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientSocketChannelFactory import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.DefaultChannelGroup import java.util.concurrent.Executors,CancellationException import org.jboss.netty.util.CharsetUtil import scala.concurrent.

Negative 53504 pI am making an application for iOS and eventually Android with Adobe Air. Its a crossword puzzle. Many crossword puzzles appsgames have this feature where you can tap a letter square and the selected square will highlight along with the rest of the letters in the word. I.e. you tap the first letter square of a five letter word and all letter squares that make up that word highlight.p  pAnother thing many crossword puzzles do is to allow the user to tap the same square again and changing the orientation. If you would for example tap the first letter square in the upper left corner of the puzzle once, it would highlight the word that goes horizontally from the corner. If you would tap that same letter square again, it would highlight the word going vertically.p  pI have all of this working as intended but my problem lies with the iOS softKeyboard. When the softKeyboard is up it wont register the tap. I have to tap away to hide the softKeyboard and then tap the same letter square again.p  pThe square is just a simple sprite with a TextField on top of it.p  pHas it something to do with the softKeyboard being up or maybe because the TextField has focus it intercepts the event dispatching p  pOne interesting thing to note is that when I tap the letter square the second time, with the softKeyboard up and the cursor blinking in the TextField, I get the Paste option hovering above the textfield. Perhaps that is what is intercepting my listener If so, can it be disabledp  pCan somebody shed a light on thisp  pFor the letter square I usep  precodesquare.addEventListenerTouchEvent.TOUCHTAP, tileTapped codepre

But as soon as I add my web service information it completely skips over the codeloadingdiv.Visible  truecode line and just does the 1020 second operation.p  pHeres the relevant lines of code.p  precode protected void btnFindMoviesClickobject sender, EventArgs e       Hides the main content that contained search options for movies     thisarticle.Visible  false     articlediv.Visible  false     lblGenres.Visible  false     ratingdiv.Visible  false     Listltintgt gList  new Listltintgt Genre List       Other code that goes through checkboxes to find out which genres      to search for in the movie search       string title  Movie Title Here      Page.Title  title      loadingdiv.Visible  true Shows loading div before completing search      MovieSearch search  new MovieSearchgList  Intensive web service use      1020 seconds     loadingdiv.Visible  false removes the loading div from the screen  codepre  pHow can I get the codeloadingdivcode to show up while my web service operations are going throughp

Negative 53504 pIve been introduced recently to AWS and I really loved it. However, Im asking myself some questions that may be stupid about architecturing for multiregions.p  pLets say an application is used by Europeans and Asians. My first idea was to add EC2 instances in Europe, as well as a S3 bucket to hold static data and a SQS queue and ElastiCache in Europe. Its going to be blazingly fast for European people, but slower for asians.p  pTo solve this, Id add CloudFront for static data, so that images are served quickly for Asians too. However, requests to server Ajax requests... still going to have some latencies, so the solution would be to add an EC2 instance in SingaporeTokyo region too.p  pHowever, new problem arise if a request is dispatched to Tokyo EC2 instance, then if it needs to receive a message from SQS that is stored in Europe or access ElastiCache data  latency again  costs for interregions transfer. So we need to add a SQS and ElastiCache in Asia too p  pMaybe I miss something, and crossregions AWS requests are superfast, but from what Ive understood, if we want fast experience for multiregions, we basically need to duplicate all services too every regions excepting S3 maybe, as we can use CloudFront for that, and I suppose we can live with the latency if a SQS job in Asia need to access a S3 resource in Europe.p  pAnyway, did I understand this correctly  Do you have any resources about how to architecture applications that target multiregions p  pThanks p

Negative 53504 pI have a GUI program that appends a text field depending on what button is pressed. Im having a problem implementing my action listener. It doesnt matter what code I put in the ActionPerformed method, I always get the same errors. There are so many errors, I couldnt list them, but they appear to indicate that the actionListener isnt firing.  I dont know if Im not adding the ActionListener for the buttons properly or what. The code I have in the ActionPerformed method currently was just a test to see if it would work at all for any button I pressed and it still doesnt work.  Thanks in advance.p  pEDIT Alright I changed the code in the ActionPerformed method so it would append the text area according to which button was pressed and Im getting the same error again.p  pEDIT No more errors, just a problem with my output.

Negative 53504 pIm currently working on a crossplatform app written in C. I have a huge problem with testing and debugging it under LinuxMono. When my application hangs due to an error, I have to kill the process either using stop button in MonoDevelop debugger or using killall command. The problem is, that after killing I cannot start the application again. When restarted from console, it waits a second or two and exits, showing nothing as output. When started from MonoDevelop, debugger loads some assemblies and then the process exits with no error. There seems to be no Monorelated service in process table. The only way to start the application again is to log off and log in again.p  pWhat Im doing wrongp

Negative 53504 pI defined an arrayp  pchar arr[1480]p  pNow, from a file, I read exactly 1480 chars and put into arr by doing arr[i]c. I know 1480 chars because I use a while loop to read one char ar a time istream.get and stop when the incrementing index  1480.p  pHowever, after that, I do strlenarray and it returns 1512. How come This only happens in some occasions, but not in all occasions, even though every time I read from file, I always read up to 1480 chars.p  pMy doubt is one char might occupy more than 1 unit units returned by strlenarr.  If so, how can I fix thisp  pThanksp  pPS I asked a problem earlier about my pointer gets garbaged, and this is the cause when I have a buffer arr of length  1480. p

Negative 53504 pI am developing an application that I compile with the IAR Embedded Workbench solution.

Negative 53504 pI scaffolded a new MVC controller, along with a corresponding view and repository for an strongIEnumerablestrong collection of a POCO class.  In the resulting view is a table that will list every entry in the collection of that class.  However, the table also contains a column for every property in that class, and I only want to display a subset of them in this view.  strongIs it a bad idea if I now manually edit the view to remove what I dont want to display in the generated HTMLstrongp  pIm not clear on whether the scaffolding features that are part of ASP.NET MVC version 3 and later are designed to generate the basic functionality for your web application, giving you the freedom to do what you want with the results afterwards, or if its considered a best practice to leave the generated results alone and find another way to do what I want to accomplish.  I know that you can customize your own scaffolding templates, but that seems like a lot of work for such a simple change.p  pThanksp

Negative 53504 pLately I bumped into this very interesting post a hrefhttpopensoul.orgblogarchives20110207concerningactivesupportconcern relnofollowhttpopensoul.orgblogarchives20110207concerningactivesupportconcerna which walks through and explains the codeActiveSupportConcerncode source code.p  pA few questions arose, but the most important was thisp  pObviously theres a method called codeappendfeaturescode which by the docs at least says emRubys default implementation of this method will add constants, methods, and variables of this module to the base moduleem.p  pI always thought that module works the same as classes in the sense of the method lookup chain  the only difference is that you cant instantiate objects from it, and that its not defined as a superclass of this class since a module is not actually a class. meaning that when a class codeincludescode a module, the module is simply being added as a direct parent in the classs inheritance hierarchy, and as a result, methods which are missing in the including class, will be looked for at the module.p  pBut if thats the case, then what does it mean that codeappendfeaturescode actually emadds methods to the base moduleem, which means that you can actually prevent this behaviour, by overriding this method which codeActiveSupportConcerncode actually does.p  pCan someone create some order in my headp
Negative 53504 pIm trying to create an application on Symfony2 with Doctrine 2 entities. My problem is that I should have a main application which contains the mainly used functions and other applications which are gonna extend it on need. For example i have a UserInterface and also a User which implements UserInterface in the main App. All the other applications should be able to use this User, but in case one of the apps needs to add more properties to this User he is able to override the user class without changing it s name or the functions call.

Negative 53504 pIm trying to get both imagemagick and pdo with sqlite going on my imac.  Ive played with the builtin apache2, ampps apache, and most recently mac ports.  Mac ports was meant to make it easy to install extensions, and I installed imagemagick ok, but then noticed that pdo had no drivers including sqlite.  Attempts to improve on that installing sqlite.so driver, recompiling have come to naught.  My question is do you have both imagemagick and sqlite pdo going on your mac, and if so, how did you do itp

Negative 53504 pIm wondering if theres a way to overcome this situationp  pI have an static class with an static variable called lets sayp  precodestatic string[] Cities  GetCities codepre  pAnd codeGetCitiescode obtains from a database all the cities. The problem is that Im getting an error with codeGetCitiescode because the data server sometimes is not available, and this error doesnt disappear even if the server is available again.  brI think that this is because the variable Cities is created only once...p
Negative 53504 pThis is probably a simple question, but I need the act of running a report to have a preevent of triggering a stored procedure. I am NOT returning data from the procedure, it is updating 2 tables in a data warehouse by doing a BULK INSERT from .csv files that have been exported from an ISAM database. The report itself uses a separate query to pull from the SQL Server tables, but the imported data is ultimately used by multiple reports so the tables need to be actually updated.  p  pThe stored procedure will run nightly as part of a regular routine, but the data affecting this particular report will be updated by users and a new .csv extract created immediately before running the report, so the report needs to fire the stored procedure to update the tables before it queries those tables itself.  p  pIve tried searching but all the references I find seem to focus on using a stored procedure as the report query, and thats not what Im trying to accomplish. I have a separate query for pulling data, I need to run the stored procedure inadditionto and preceding the report query, if that makes sense.p  pDoes anybody know how to trigger a stored procedure as the opening lines of my report queryp  pThanks in advance for any ideas.

Negative 53504 pI am using titanium appcelerator for android to write my app.p  pOn my main screen i have a tableView, full of listings that are rows, that paginates 15 at a time. So once u scroll down to 15th row another 15 rows will be added to the table. A screen usually shows 3 to 10 of the rows at a time depending on screen height samsung mini vs nexus 7p  pEach row contains a view which contains several child Views and imageViews. This cause very slow performance when scrolling up and down the list. To solve this i turned the parent view which is added to the row into an image, which increased performance massively when scrolling.p  pHere is a general snippetp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode    Turn the entire view postview into an image. postview consists of many child views         var blob  postview.toImagenull, true      Create the Image view of entire postview, the parent of all child views     var tempImage  Ti.UI.createImageView     height  auto,     width  auto,     top  0,     zindex  3,     image  blob                      adding the ImageView created from the parent view which all child ies have      been added to    row.addtempImage      This is the array of rows to be added to the tableView      tabData[i]  row       ........      tableView.appendRowtabData codepre  pHowever, especially on larger screens when u scroll the app crashes, which using DDMS shows as OutOfMemory error. Which unfortunately i cant post the specific error right now because i dont have access to a larger device now. Also the memory error does also occur when i dont use the method of changing the entire view to an image, but gives less detail on the errors themselves in DDMS.p  pSo im not sure if its related to the toImage method, or im not freeing memory properly in javascript, or if its a titanium or java issue or what.p  pAnyone any ideas.

Negative 53504 pI have a little problem with boost serialization. There are many examples that shows how to serialize a derived class pointer through the base class pointer by simply using BOOSTCLASSEXPORT and BOOSTCLASSEXPORTIMPLEMENT. This is working fine and have no problems at all.p  pHowever, I do not want to serialize a pointer, as the deserialization in the other side should be again over a pointer and then, boost creates a new instance of the serialized object.p  pI can serialize a dereferenced pointer and then deserialize again over an existing object instance without problems, and no new instances are created. However, when the dereferenced pointer is over the base class, the derived class is not serialized as expected when serializing over pointers.p  pWorking examplep  precodeClass A Class B  public A  A baseClass  new B ar ltlt baseClass  works perfectly codepre  pNot working examplep  precodeClass A Class B  public A A baseClass  new B ar ltlt baseClass  only A is serialized codepre  pI can get it working by simple serializing over the derived class likep  precodeB derivedClass  new B ar ltlt derivedClass  works fine codepre  pBut all the references I have in my structures are of base class type. Also I cannot serialize the pointer as I do not need to instantiate new objetcs when deserializing, only overwrite the contents over an existing instance. p  pI have tried to serialize the pointer and trying to deserialize over an existing instance, but this does not work correctly. When I say deserialize over an existing instance, I meanp  precodeA baseClass  new B  baseClass is used in the program and in a given moment, its contents must be overwrite, so ar gtgt baseClass codepre  pAs I said, I do not need a new instance of baseClass when deserializing. So, is there any way to get this workingp
Negative 53504 pI am trying to display rss feed entries in a JEditorPane with the setText method of the JEditorPane, in a method which gets the relevant information the RSSEntries.p  pIn this method I get the items that are to be posted in a stringBuilder,  which works fine so far. However when, at the end of the method, I try to set the text from the stringBuilder to the JEditorPane, it does not post anything. I have tried to output the contents of the stringbuilder with println and the text does work but not  when I set it to the JEditorPane. I also have tried to set up a setText method of my own in which I pass the string builder as a parameter and then from within the relevant class try to set it with a get method like this meditorPane.setTextgetText The get method gets the right information but this procedure does not set the text on the JEditorPane either .

The problem with this is that if the user has put focus on a control that does not accept strongemText Inputemstrong, then PreviewTextInput never fires.p  pcodePreviewKeyDowncode does always fire, but the data it presents is ugly and I cant seem to find anyway of translating KeyDown events to a normalized string. I found a Stack Overflow article at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1495092convertreceivedkeysinpreviewkeydowntoastring titleConvert received keys in PreviewKeyDown to a stringConvert received keys in PreviewKeyDown to a stringa seemed promising, but it does not appear that I can wire this in my App.xaml.cs no dependency object.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions would be great. Or, as an alternative, at least a way of detecting which keyboard the input is coming from, at which point using codePreviewKeyDowncode might be a viable option because I can assume a dumbed down input stream.p
Negative 53504 pI was experimenting with ways to capture screen on windows and consequently deciding on the fastest way to do so. The most common is obviously the GDI way. And it is decent in performance as well. Depending on the system load and staticnonstatic screen content, the screen capture rate ranged from 2747 fps Windows 7, Intel i52.6 GHz, 8 GB RAM.p  pNow, with DirectX front buffer approachusing the GetFrontBufferData API, the performance was comparable but slightly on the slower sideI couldnt reach as high as 48 fps.p  pI went through this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5069104fastestmethodofscreencapturingFastest method of screen capturinga and the tried out the way suggested in the accepted answer using getRenderTarget and getRenderTargetData, but as suggested in the comments, all I get is a black image.

Negative 53504 pIn iOS 6 and previous, if you register for codeUIControlEventValueChangedcode on a codeUISwitchcode and the user taps the switch, your method is called when the change animation finishes.  In iOS 7, it appears to happen when the switch animation starts or at least when the touch ends.  Is there a way to regain the old behaviorp  pbEDITb I should clarify why Im asking this.  I have a switch in a codeUITableViewCellcode.  When the switch value changes, the content of the table changes, so I need to call code[tableView reloadData]code.  The changes are too complex to handle with the addremove sectioncells animation API.  So my switch gets regenerated in a new cell with its new value, and I lose the cool switch animation.  In iOS 6 and previous, this wasnt a problem because the handler executed at the end of said animation.p

Negative 53504 pCs codeTaskcodes have codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode for libraries to prevent synchronization to for example the UIthread which is not always necessary a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinehh456402.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinehh456402.aspxap  pIn .NET I believe there can only be one codeSynchonizationContextcode, so its clear on which threadpool a codeTaskcode should execute its continuation.br For a library, when you cant assume the user is in a webrequestin .NET codeHttpContext.Current.Itemscode flows, commandline normal multithreaded, XAMLWindows Forms single UI thread, its almost always better to use codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode, so the Waiter knows it can just execute the continuation on whatever thread is being used to call the Waiter this is only bad if you do blocking code in the library which could lead to thread starvation on the threadpool where the initial workload is started, let assume we dont do that.br The point is that from a library perspective you dont want to use a thread from the callers threadpool to synchronize a continuation, you just want the continuation to run on whatever thread. This saves a context switch and keeps the load of the UI thread for example.p  pIn Scala, for each operation namely map on Futures, you need an codeExecutionContextcode passed implicitly. This makes managing threadpools incredibly easy, which I like a lot more than the way .NET has somewhat strange codeTaskFactorycodes which nobody seems to use, they just use the default codeTaskFactorycode.  p  pMy question is, does Scala have the same problem as .NET in respect to context switches being sometimes unnecessary, and if so, is there a way, similar to codeConfigureAwaitcode, to fix thisp  pConcrete example Im finding in Scala where I wonder about thisp  precodedef trace[T]message gt Stringblock gt Future[T] Future[T]     if logger.isTraceEnabled block   else      val startedAt  System.currentTimeMillis     block.map  result gt       val timeTaken  System.currentTimeMillis  startedAt       logger.tracesmessage took timeTakenms       result          codepre  pIm using play and I generally import plays default, implicit codeExecutionContextcode. The map on codeblockcode needs to run on an execution context.p  pIf I wrote this piece of Scala in a library and I would add an implicit parameter codeexecutionContextcodep  precodedef trace[T]message gt Stringblock gt Future[T]implicit executionContext ExecutionContext Future[T]   codepre  pinstead of importing plays default codeExecutionContextcode in the libary.p

I also tried a codeCTEcode selfjoin, but since the last day or first day of the year might be different, this also yields inaccurate results.p  pFor instance, using the below actually generates some codeMINcodes in the codeMAXcode and vice versa, though in theory it should only grab the codeMAXcode date for the year and the codeMINcode date for the yearp  precodeWITH CT AS     SELECT Points         , Date         , DATEPARTDY,Date DA     FROM Table     WHERE DATEPARTDY,Date BETWEEN 363 AND 366         OR DATEPARTDY,Date BETWEEN 1 AND 3  SELECT MINc.Date MinYear     , MAXc.Date MaxYear FROM CT c GROUP BY YEARc.Date codepre

Negative 53504 pSo im developing Android app, sort of a book reader. The books are stored as a 500mb binary files with certain objects stored in it, and in a tiny binary file that contains mappings to particular objects in the big file. I need to find most efficient way to perform an update of certain publication file.  The incomming update package will contain relatively small file with offsets  lenghts of objects that need to be deleted from the original big file, a set of new objects that will be added at the end of big file, and the new mapping after the update is done obviously.p  pIve googled ALOT, but still I cant find out whether theres any better solution than copying the content i want to be kept into a new file. Is ther any more efficient way to do this I mean the aproach i mentioned requires double disc space as the main big file takes, and it doesnt seem to be any fast way either.p  pThx in advance, Macp
Negative 53504 pIm running a compiled Python script that employs Selenium to start a Chrome Webdriver session that visits a site and carries out a few tasks. The script behaves as I would expect it to, except that it prints an error message to console when I first start the webdriver. The error reads p  precode[246072681121133303ERRORbasefeatureprovider.cc122] manifestTypes Allowing webpage contexts requires supplying a value for matches. codepre  pDoes anyone know what this means Like I said above, the script appears to behave as I expect it to, which makes me wonder what this message is attempting to indicate. Googling the phrase brings up a slew of code.google pages that mention but do not clearly describe the same error. I can post the code, but its excessively long 2000 lines and Im not sure which lines are pertinent to the problem, because I cant understand the error message. I normally use the Firefox browser with Selenium, but am exploring Chrome as an alternative. In any event, I would be most thankful if someone could help me understand this error message. p

Negative 53504 pIs there any implementation of a variant like boostant or boostvariant, but with abstract interface, out therep  pWhat I want is to pass variants between DLLs in a loosely coupled app. So if one DLL starts to store something new in the variant, I want to avoid changing the code of all other DLLs. All of the DLLs are build with different versions of VisualStudio with static CRT linkage, so one cant use STL classes in interfaces. Boost dependency is also undesirable. Thats why I wans an abstract interface.p  pIf I had to implement it, I would make an strongabstract interfacestrong with functions like codeMyVariantInterfaceGetSetDataint valuetypetag, byte data  0code, which can be passed between DLLs safely, strongplus a templated wrapperstrong which allows convenient storage, extraction and does all sizetype checks inside the scope of one DLL.p  pDoes something like this already existp

Negative 53504 pI apologize in advance for the wordiness of this post.  I never know what will be important so I usually write more than needed.p  pstrongA little backgroundstrongp  pI have a week and a half to create a POC for using OLAP behind clientfacing reports. We arent committed to a reporting tool and we have a lot of data, so OLAP seems to make sense. Right now we use SSRS 2005 against a somewhat flattened reporting database but we have a new client whos asking us to become sophisticated quickly.  p  pI worked with SSAS 10 years ago  built cubes and simple pivot tables off of them  no MDX. Im savvy with SSRS, but against relational sources. We have no dimensional model so I have to mock one up. I was going to do the mocking in SSAS 2012 against a SQL 2005 DB. p  pstrongRequirements for the POCstrong  p  blockquote   pReport information about physician performance across multiple attributesp      pemDimensionsemp      ul   liTime DateMonthYearli   liPhysician li   liPhysician Specialty 1M with Physicianli   liAffiliation 1  Affiliation 2  Affiliation 3 hierarchy, 1M with Physicianli   liRegistry  HEDIS Measure hierarchy, MM with Physician, HEDIS hereinafter because Measure gets   confusingli   ul      pemMeasuresem lowest granularity is PhysicianDateHEDIS  drillthrough to patient data will be necessary at some pointp      ul   liPatient Populationli   liPatients Seen a portion of Patient Populationli   liScore this is our KPI  quotient  of Patients Seen  Patient   Populationli   liQuartile based on Score measured for Physician, Affiliations 1, 2 amp   3, HEDIS and Specialty across DayMonthYearli   ul blockquote  pI have created a functional cube with all of the dimensions and the two additive measures Patient Population amp Patients Seen. I went to add Score and Quartile and froze.  Now Im in analysis paralysis mode and panicking. I didnt know MDX was so unintuitive or maybe Im just dense, and that calculating quartiles would be such a problemp  pSo now Im trying to throw something together in the database with views and static tables. Im pretty junior when it comes to dimensional modeling.  I need to design the tables for the quickest, easiest cube development and report turnaround possible. It doesnt need to be perfect, but I havent seen a project like this all the way through and I would love some advice on how to avoid running into obvious gotchas during cube and report development due to poor DB design choices.  Can someone can give me a generalized what would you do in my shoes run downp  pstrongHere are some of my questionsconcerns in the form of mental vomitstrongp  pSo I have fully additive and nonadditive measures, right Im not even sure what Score is  I dont think it qualifies as semiadditive. Anyway, Im torn as to whether to store these nonfullyadditive metrics in a Measure Dimension or multiple fact tables at different granularities. p  pIt seems like going the fact table route might be less confusing, but then does each fact table get its own cube and drill downacross would be accomplished through some sort of linking in Excel or SSRS E.g., youre looking at the YTD Physician Scores by Annual HEDIS Quartile...how do you drill down to the MTD Physician Scores by Monthly HEDIS Quartile if they are in different cubes Or would they be in the same cube in different Measure Groups maybe... Or if I go with the Measure Dimension and use a single cube, how do I protect the user from the scenario above...theyre looking at the YTD Physician Scores by Annual HEDIS Quartile, then replace Annual HEDIS Quartile with Monthly HEDIS Quartile  how is such a thing that prevented  Or is this scenario even legitp  pId love to throw this in SSRS where I can control things through parameters but how hard is it to such against an OLAP source  Not to mention interactive graphsp  pI am so confused right now I dont even know if these questions are making sense. Any help or even links to succinct documentation that you found helpful would be great p

Negative 53504 pIm trying to ensure that a given string is a valid double. Most answers to this sort of question suggest using codeDouble.parseDoubleinputStringcode. However this isnt as robust as Id hope. For instance if I enter a String such as em1oneem codeDouble.parseDouble1onecode will output 1 as opposed to returning an exception for an invalid double. p  pIve tried to get around this by iterating over the string and ensuring that every number is a digitp  precode    for int i  0 i lt number.length i          previousChar  number.charAti          if Character.isDigitnumber.charAti                 ampamp number.charAti  .                                      ampamp number.charAti  ,              return null                codepre  pBut for cases such as 20..02 or 20,,02 this will simply return 20. I was wondering what the best way to account for cases such as these would be. p

Negative 53504 pIm creating a GTKGStreamer application C gstreamer for audio and pygobject gtk for gui which waits for MIDI input and responds to it. The MIDI capturing is handled with the RTMidi library.p  pIn the past I was able to successfully release the GIL using the strongnogilstrong and strongwith gilstrong keywords in my Cython .pyx file. The problem is that I need to be able to read MIDI input values from my C callback function from python, so that I can make changes to the GUI based on this input.p  pBecause of this, I restructured my code slightly so that my python code passes a python function objecta function that I want to call in my RTMidi C callback, which I then use Cython to cast to an object of type void so I can pass this data through C code.p  pIn other words, whenever MIDI input is detected, the python function that I passed as a void is called. This works fine. The part that isnt working since I added this functionality is the releasing of the GIL. Now, whenever my application starts, my function which accepts MIDI input is not properly started on its own thread, so the GTK gui is never actually shown. p  pSome info about releasing the GIL in the Cython docsp  pstrongCode in the body of the statement must not manipulate Python objects in any way, and must not call anything that manipulates Python objects without first reacquiring the GIL. Cython currently does not check this.strongp  pI do not believe I am violating any of these rules.p  pCould this be a bug with Cython or am I missing something herep  pHas anyone else had any experience using Cython to call python functions from C callbacks p  pHeres a reduced version of the .pyx.

Negative 53504 pBased on the documentation of java.NIO, buffers are threadunsafe, while channels in most of the cases codeFileChannel, SocketChannelcode etc. are safe to be used by multiple threads. What I cannot find in the documentation is a clear description of what happens when e.g. two threads start to read from a codeFileChannelcode concurrently. Does the first operation read first N bytes, or is it possible to get first M bytes to the first channels buffer, and then the next couple would go to the second buffer, before we context switch would read some more into the first etc. Does anyone know what the guarantees are for multithreaded access to channelsp

Negative 53504 pIve set up a C program using boostasio to network two computers on my home network together. One acts as the server and the other acts as a client. The client computer transfers its players data50chars to the server, which draws the server computers player and the client computers player. The players are squares that are moved around with the arrow keys. The client square on the server computer lags really badly, but the server square renders exactly like one would expect. I outputted the time between the servers asynchronous reads of the client data, and it shows that the reading routinely takes about 14 ms, and after about ten reads, it takes 100ms for one read, then goes back to normal.

Negative 53504 pIm using MS SAPI for voice recognition, and just thinking how to get ride of the grammar file Its easier to just give an input string with several commands, and it will be nice to modify that input command list instead of revise the grammar file. Which API should I pass my input string I can write code to generate the grammar file, the question is  why its necessary to include a separate file I understand in grammar file it gives the language model, it should be done somewhere else. Sometimes it takes time to explain how to use it to someone who never used it before. Any idea to get ride of the grammar file Thanks p

Negative 53504 pWhat are the performance implications in postgres of using an array to store values as compared to creating another table to store the values with a hasmany relationship p  pI have one table that needs to be able to store anywhere from about 1100 different string values in either an array column or a separate table. These values will need to be frequently searched for exact matches, so lookup performance is critical. Would the array solution be faster, or would it be faster to use joins to lookup the values in the separate tablep
Negative 53504 pIm developing a site and using java, jsp and jpa. The aim of the site is to give an interface for user to select data from database.

Im trying to figure out the most efficient way to achieve this with grunt, but so far Im working very manually with code like thisp  precodegrunt.initConfig   concat      app        files [                      src [..appregistration.js, ..appregistraion.module.js],              dest ..appregistrationregistration.module.js         ,                      src [..appcourses.js, ..appcourses.module.js],              dest ..appcoursescourses.module.js         ,                      src [..appadmin.js, ..appadmin.module.js],              dest ..appadminadmin.module.js                ],        ,  codepre  pI think there must be a more efficient and less manual way to do what Im trying to achieve. Does anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 53504 pFairly new to this. I am trying to add some valuekeys to an array that already has valuekeys.p  pThe itemsArray contains the json and is derived from the variable json which is a parameter passed to the method from a rest api call.p  pThis is the code I am using and it aborts at [i setobject] with strong[NSCFDictionary setObjectforKey] mutating method sent to immutable objectstrongp  precodeNSMutableDictionary  itemsArray  [json objectForKeyitems] for  NSMutableDictionary i in itemsArray             [i setObjectFirstValue forKeyparents]                          codepre  pAll this should do is add in the key called parents for each item in the dictionary.p  pNow if I hard code the valuekeys  to the mutable dictionary itemsArray  it works fine.

Negative 53504 pI am developing an Android application for tablet which will be used as a catalog of many products around 10 000.p  pI display them in a gridview, I only display the 250 first, and if I reach the end of these 250 I load 250 more.p  pMy problem is the pictures. My application seems to work when I scroll not quickly, it is smooth, and there is no problems but it can use 300 or 400 MB of RAM, so I guess Im doing something badly. I heard that Im supposed to use WeakReferences but Im not sure how to use them... That was for the first problem. It is not really important since the user may only use this application, and if it works very well... But yes, if I can improve it I will tryp  pThe other big problem here is that when I do something like p  ul liScroll fast to the bottomli liImmediately scroll fast to the topli ul  pSome pictures of the bottom are displayed on the pictures of the top and not temporarly, they change again only if I scroll and come back at them.p  pWhat I know actually p  ul liThe mechanism of the griview reuse the views. If I have 10 views visibles, When the 5 first are not visibles, they are used for the 5 next ones that will be visible. I dont know how many view are in this recycler. ul liThis means that when I scroll to the bottom I see the 5 views which were not visible in the place of the 5 next ones for a few moment then the good views are loaded. To not have this bad effect, I set a picture white the color of my background using the method setRecyclerListener.li ulli liI dont recycle  use the good way to load my pictures and recycle them but dont know how to make it betterli liI use animations, I dont think there is any link with my problem due to themli liI load the pictures in AsyncTask, that seems to work, but the picures are always loaded in fast scroll too which is not really a good thingli lipWhen scrolling bottom then top quickly sometimes I have the wrong pictures displayed. It may happen in other cases.p  precodepublic class ProduitsAdapter extends ArrayAdapterltArticlegt      private final Activity context     private ArrayListltArticlegt params     private Resources

Im using code that I adapted from a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles6235EnumeratingNetworkResources relnofollowthisa CodeProject article on enumerating network resources.p  pThe code in the original article immediately enumerates all network resources as soon as the codeEnumerateServerscode object is instantiated, recursively calling itself whenever it finds a container, and adds each node found to an codeArrayListcode.  This is inefficient asp  ol liYou cant start enumerating anything until after the network tree has been fully traversed.li liThe enumeration can take a significant amount of time depending on network traffic amp the number of nodes that the current user can see.li ol  pIm displaying the network resources in a WPF codeTreeViewcode control, so I only want to traverse the nodes that are the direct children of the node that the user has expanded.p  pWith that in mind, I made some changes to the code.

Negative 53504 pWhat api do I have to use to get the time difference between 2 timezones without inputing any datetime.p  pWhat I am doing right now, is make a temporary date midnight from one of the timezone then convert to utz and then convert again to the other timezone and then compute the duration of the two. It is working but is there a simpler api to get the time difference by just giving the name of the zonesp  pToo long for comment, so I put it here. server is on diff. timezone, datainformations come from clients from different timezones and save in the db in utc. Problem arise when the client request a transaction history in a certain date. It seems it is not a simple conversion of the requested date client timezone to utc, I need to add the time difference of the server timezone and the client timezone to the converted utc time to get the correct date. so i do it like I said above. Now I found out that the time difference should be added or subtracted, depending on whos timezone is ahead. Well anyway thanks for everybodys inputs. Need the project to run asap so they decided to use just one timezone for the meantime. Implemented or not I will seek a solution to this for future projects. p

Negative 53504 pI am trying to create an experimentation environment for myself where my application runs as a telnet server for theoretically unlimited telnet clients that can execute Lua commands in their own Lua environment. For this, every client has its own thread as I want them to have their own windows message loop with their own specific needs.p  pI have created several modules accessible in Lua to do some fun stuff. I also want to be able to create a window from Lua, so I would like to add a module called window and add a new method. The problem is, I need to know what thread I am in well, to be more specific, I need the class that I use to define the client the thread is handling with and I dont know how to get it inside the C Lua functions for codewindow.newcode.p  pWith normal functions, you can add upvalues I already have a simple codewindowcode function that is able to create a window that is managed by the thread it is running in, but when creating modules, this is not so simple when you try to do it the standard way.p  pMy windowmodule has the following typical luaopen functionp  precodeLUALIBAPI int luaopenwindowluaState L      luaLnewmetatableL, window     luaLsetfuncsL, regwindowm, 0     luaLnewlibL, regwindowf     return 1  codepre  pMy thread creates a Lua state and opens the necessary libs, including the window onep  precodeluaLrequirefL, window, luaopenwindow, 1 luapopL, 1 codepre  pI know that the function codeluaLsetfuncscode supports upvalues, but its already too late there. I dont have a way to pass the values to put in the up values.p  pI have tried to push them before calling codeluaLrequirefcode and pop them inside the codeluaopenwindowcode function, pushing them again before the call to codeluaLsetfuncscode but it doesnt work the pushed values are gone because of how codeluaLsetfuncscode works internally. I could of course write my own codeluaLsetfuncscode that supports upvalues well, I think I could, but there must already exist a better wayp  pEdit BTW. I would like to prevent using a global Lua variable to store the pointer to my class. That could become a security risk and although this tool will probably never be used outside of my computer, I just want to code this right.p

I have one current connection to a client, and one connection to a worker node.p  pIf receiving a message from a client, I want to pass some of that information to the worker node, but my TCP Akka Actor representing the worker node connection doesnt seem to like when I, from the thread running the Client Akka Actor, send messages to the Akka Actor worker node.p  pSo, as an example, if the client sends a message to delete a file, and that partitions on that file is on a worker node, I want to send a TCP message to that worker node that it should delete the partitions.p  pHow can I from the client Actor send a message to the worker node Actor, that it should pass to the worker node server through TCP When just doing the regular codeworkerActorRef  msgcode it doesnt receive it at all and no logging is shown.p  pI hope this question wasnt unclear but essentially I want the codeworkerActorRefcode to in some way be able to have some functionality similar to send emthisem through the TCP socket.p  pCheers,p  pJohanp

Negative 53504 pIm currently writing a lot of codeasynccode library code, and Im aware of the practice of adding codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode after each async call so as to avoid marshalling the continuation code back to the original usually UI thread context. As I dont like the unlabelled Boolean parameter, I tended to write this as codeConfigureAwaitcontinueOnCapturedContext falsecode instead.p  pI added an extension method to make it a little more readable and reduce the typing somewhatp  precodepublic static class TaskExtensions      public static ConfiguredTaskAwaitableltTResultgt WithoutCapturingContextltTResultgtthis TaskltTResultgt task              return task.ConfigureAwaitcontinueOnCapturedContext false           public static ConfiguredTaskAwaitable WithoutCapturingContextthis Task task              return task.ConfigureAwaitcontinueOnCapturedContext false       codepre  pSo now I can have something like codeawait SomethingAsync.WithoutCapturingContextcode instead of codeawait SomethingAsync.ConfigureAwaitcontinueOnCapturedContext falsecode.

Also Im not allowed to use sort.p  pI want to use the comparator to sort the ArrayList so I needed to implement it. However it wouldnt let me implement it without making the class abstract. I did so and although it meant I no longer get compiler errors I dont fully understand what it means to make an abstract class and what repercussions it will have. Am I doing the right thing Thanks.p
Negative 53504 pIm having a primefaces rendering issue in one Eclipse App but not in another.

Negative 53504 pI have a singlepage website that is a calendar that is a full years worth of images. The page load has 344 requests and 20MB total load. Its a simple PHP page without a database.p  pThe requests include a CSS file 15KB, 4 JS files 20KB, two fonts 50KB, a video 3MB and the rest are images. The max image size is 400x200 139KB but the majority are 200x400 30KB. The images currently load as CSS backgrounds, but could be loaded as  if it helps.p  pThe files will be hosted on a cloudbased CDN. The page is optimized as much as it can be to not block the DOM from being loaded. The images are the main issue, IMO.p  pstrongWhat is the best way to load this pages imagesstrong p  pI have tried lazy load, but the problem with that is it really kills the browser when it redraws and reflows. I have removed a bunch of bells and whistles like CSS3 styles, animations and others due to redrawreflow issues as well.p  pThe current options I can think of are an infinite scroll that loads each month before its inview or break up each month into their own pages.

Negative 53504 pIve searched all around, made several changes over the past two weeks, and still no luck so here I am.p  pWe just put up a new site, and there are 3 different forms. Each form sends to a different email of theirs, a forwarder that sends to the same email of theirs I had to make this after I figured out there was a problem with them not receiving emails from the website, and one of our emails. p  pCurrently, they use office 365 for their email. A few days ago I figured out to change the SPF record, so I added the IP of their current website.p  pHere is the current SPF recordp  pcodevspf1 includespf.protection.outlook.com ip423.229.157.193 a allcodep  pIm stumped. Ive sent test submissions, and they receive the forward, and I receive it from my email, but the email that its supposed to be sent to doesnt receive it. p  pI dont have access to their office 365 account. I tried a different option of sending the emails through swiftmailer, but GoDaddy doesnt allow me to connect to their smtp details, so thats a bust. p  pHas anyone encountered this problem before and know of a solution All help is greatly appreciated. p  pstrongTHE SOLUTIONstrongp  pAfter hours of calling, I was able to get the problem solved. I should have edited this earlier, but better late than never. In cPanel, there is an area for routing mail. It was set to local, rather than remote. Every email that came through went to the local emails, and since their were none, they were discarded. After changing the option to remote, the emails started flowing through. After the 3rd or 4th call, I reached someone whos actually dealt with this problem because he explained what was happening and the fix in under two minutes, unlike the others. I hope this helps anyone in the future with the same problems I encountered.p

Negative 53504 pI am using the great Charles Web Proxy do make a reverse proxy and debug an exchange between my client and a secure server.I accepted the Charles certificate as a trusted authority and it works generally very well when using it in Proxy Mode, the problem is when I try to make a reverse proxy.p  pI am using an external library over which I have no control that uses an HttpUrlConnection and lets me specify the URL. Following the a hrefhttpwww.charlesproxy.comdocumentationproxyingreverseproxy relnofollowCharles documentationa, I set my URL to codehttpsmybox.test.com100code note that I used a hostname, added to my host file, instead of localhost in the hope that I can have a valid certificate.p  pThe problem is that as part of the Https validation, HttpUrlConnection verifies the host name mybox.test.com since it is pointing to my reverse proxy against the one in the certificate the one of the secure site I am connecting to. Obviously that does not match and causes a Caused by javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException codejava.security.cert.CertificateException No subject alternative DNS name matching localhost found.codep  pI realize that Charles cannot generate a certificate for mybox.test.com, since it only listens to a particular port and has no knowledge of the URL used in the HttpUrlConnection. I do not see how it could generate a correct certificate that would be accepted.p  pMy question is is there a better way to use a reverse proxy with Https or do I need to disable the host name and certificate validation p
Negative 53504 pI have a emSongsem collection with these fields and these default values on creation integer is a dynamic valuep  precodeduration integer, score integer, checked true, ready false, current false, done false. codepre  pI created templates which subscribe to each of those boolean values, excepting emreadyem.p  pI have a emplayerem route which subscribes to emcurrenttrueem, and an iframe containing a Youtube video is set to autoplay on that route. I also have a emdurationem property which I get through Json from youtubes API, which of course varies depending on the song.p  pThen I wrote an emobserveChangesem function that receives the emdurationem of the Song and set a emtimeem Session which counts backwards on that emdurationem property so that when it hits zero the value of emcurrentem is set to emfalseem and emdoneem is set to emtrueem when the currently playing song ends emtimeem hits 0p  pNext I wrote another function that listens to an event on my input which sets emreadyem to emtrueem and prepares that emreadytrueem song to be set to emcurrenttrueem.p  pHere is the codep  precodeTemplate.player.rendered  function    var queue  Songs.findreadytrue   var hook  queue.observeChanges     added functionid, song       var duration  Session.gettime       var interval, timeLeft       timeLeft  function          if duration gt 0            duration          console.logduration          else ifduration0            Meteor.callsetCurrent, id           return Meteor.clearIntervalinterval                       interval  Meteor.setIntervaltimeLeft, 1000             var songs  Songs.find     current true      var handle  songs.observeChanges     added functionid, song        var duration  song.duration       var interval, timeLeft       timeLeft  function          if duration gt 0            duration           Session.settime, duration          else            Meteor.callsetDone, id           return Meteor.clearIntervalinterval                       interval  Meteor.setIntervaltimeLeft, 1000     ,     removed function            codepre  pThis is working perfectly.

For example, if I have 600 employees to insert, I will create two SQL insert queries one for the first 500 and the other for the next 100. My insert method looks like this to make it simple, I only consider insertion of 500,1000 rowsp  precodeTransactional public void insertListltEmployeegt list throws RuntimeException   Dao dao  new Dao   String sql1  buildSQL list.subList0,500the first 500. buildSQL is a simple method which build an insert query for the list   String sql2  buiildSQL list.subList500,list.sizethe remaining   dao.executeSQLsql1dao performs the sql query to the database   dao.executeSQLsql2  codepre  pAnd here is the spring configuration. I use HibernateTransactionManager.p  precode  ltbean idtxManager  classorg.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManagergt     ltproperty namesessionFactorygt          ltref localmySessionFactorygt     ltpropertygt   ltbeangt codepre  pMy Dao class performs my sql to the database and if there is an exception during insertion, I will throw a RuntimeException.p  blockquote   pThe problemp blockquote  pI tried to insert 501 employees to an empty table. The first 500 have unique ids and the last one has the same id as the first one. Therefore when I insert the last one, there will be a DUPLICATEPRIMARY KEY error. I expect that the previous insert method will rollback  No rows should be inserted to the table. However, I noticed that the first 500 got inserted to the databasep  pI then tried to use Hibernate API. My insert method becomesp  precodeTransactional public void insertListltEmployeegt list throws RuntimeException   Dao dao  new Dao   for Employee employee list      dao.saveemployee  codepre  pAnd it actually did what I expect No rows are inserted to the database once there is an exception.p  blockquote   pMy questionsp blockquote  ol liI wonder if springhibernate support transaction management for native SQL.li liThe rollback works if I directly save an entity using Hibernate.The reason why I want to use native sql is that I actually need to insert employees to different tables based on, say, the insertion datetime. e.g the new emloyees this year will be inserted to tblemployee2015.Therefore its easier to map to different tables using native SQL. Is there any other elegant way to handle mapping to different tablesli liI am assuming that one sql for multiple row insertion is very efficient. Therefore I want to insert 500 rows by one sql. I dont want to do Hibernate save one by one in a loop. Is this assumption correctli ol  pThank you so much for your attentionp

Negative 53504 pSpring Boot automatically initializes the underlying logging system using the codeLoggingApplicationListenercode. This is a nice thing if the application Im developing runs isolated or standalone.p  pHowever Im developing a web application that will be deployed into the WSO2 Application Server, which offers unified logging using log4j, with features like central log level management at runtime via web interface, business reporting etc.p  pIf I use Spring Boot as is, it logs everything completely on its own. My first shot was, to remove codespringbootstarterloggingcode and manually add codeslf4japicode as codeprovidedcode. This works to some extent, since the codeLoggingApplicationListenercode now overrides settings of the global logmanager provided by WSO2 and even causes global appenders to be closed.p  pThe only solution I came up with is to remove the listener via reflection. Then Spring Boot starts to behave exactly as it should logging via the global logger and not overriding the pre defined log levels, output formats, appenders, etc.p  pThat solution looks like thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeSpringBootApplication public class MyApp extends SpringBootServletInitializer       public static void mainString... args          SpringApplication.runMyApp.class, args           Override     protected SpringApplicationBuilder configureSpringApplicationBuilder builder          try              Field appField  SpringApplicationBuilder.class.getDeclaredFieldapplication             appField.setAccessibletrue             SpringApplication app  SpringApplicationappField.getbuilder              Field listenersField  SpringApplication.class.getDeclaredFieldlisteners             listenersField.setAccessibletrue             ListltApplicationListenerltgtgt listeners  ListltApplicationListenerltgtgt listenersField.getapp             for int i  listeners.size  1 i gt 0 i                  if listeners.geti instanceof LoggingApplicationListener                      listeners.removei                                        catch NoSuchFieldException e              e.printStackTrace          catch IllegalAccessException e              e.printStackTrace                  return builder.sourcesMyApp.class       codepre  pIs there any better solution to my problem thats maybe less hacky which I may have overlooked during my research and code analysisp

Negative 53504 pI need to implement TLS authentication using a smart card with installed certificate and its assosiated publicprivate key pair on it.

There are smart card operations available that can be used for signing and decrypting with a private key on the card to proove the app has got access to the private key.p  hr  pThe question I need to know the answer for is, if there is a way of establishing TLS connection on iOS using either objectivec, C or C where a reference to a private key itself is not needed, but the connection can be established by signing a piece of given data with the private key and returning the signed piece of data when needed  Can you please provide me with some ideas or examples of how could this be done.

Negative 53504 pIm in the process of parsing data, and writing it to csv files before importing them to a database.

The second csv file, has two columns as well, authorid and publicationid. I publication could have numerous authors and an author could have numerous publications.p  pNow here is my issue. The code I wrote is taking waaaay too long to parse. I have over 2 million records Im going through, and its going at a pace of about 6,000 records an hour.

Negative 53504 pI have a question related to the machine learning task. The problem is to predict a value based on the vector of strings. The most straightforward idea that came to mind was to use linear regression. However, since my input is nonnumeric, I thought Id use hashcode of my strings, but Ive read somewhere here that the results will be meaningless. Another idea was to encode my strings in base 26 using the letter positions in the alphabet, but I havent tested it yet, thus asking for advice.p  pCould someone recommend a good meaningful way of encoding strings so that they can be used in linear regression algorithm Or suggest another machine learning algorithm suitable for the task.p  pTo summarise the input to the classifier will consist of a fixed size array of strings arrays are fixed length, not strings, and the output should be an integer in range 0100. The training data will consist of a collection of such input arrays xvalues with corresponding numbers yvalues.p

When I go to iterate both collections  they wont match up correctly and the wrong person will be credited with the wrong order.p  pXML File of product titles COLLECTION b p  precodeltListOrderItemsgt     ltOrderItemgt         ltTitlegtItemfromCustomer1ltTitlegt     ltOrderItemgt     ltOrderItemgt         ltTitlegtItemfromCustomer1ltTitlegt     ltOrderItemgt     ltOrderItemgt         ltTitlegtItemfromCustomer2ltTitlegt     ltOrderItemgt     ltOrderItemgt         ltTitlegtItemfromCustomer3ltTitlegt     ltOrderItemgt ltListOrderItemsgt codepre  pShipping Information COLLECTION ap  precodeltListOrdersResultgt     ltOrdersgt         ltOrdergt             ltNamegtdave lainltNamegt             ltAddressLine1gt630232 JEKASS RDltAddressLine1gt             ltCitygtPARISltCitygt             ltStateOrRegiongtTXltStateOrRegiongt             ltPostalCodegt328185454ltPostalCodegt             ltCountryCodegtUSltCountryCodegt             ltPhonegt407745186ltPhone         ltOrdergt         ltOrdergt             ltNamegtJOE SCHMOltNamegt             ltAddressLine1gt635232 CHERRY RDltAddressLine1gt             ltCitygtPARISltCitygt             ltStateOrRegiongtTXltStateOrRegiongt             ltPostalCodegt876458ltPostalCodegt             ltCountryCodegtUSltCountryCodegt             ltPhonegt5425546574ltPhone                           ltOrdergt         ltOrdergt             ltNamegtRAY CHARLESltNamegt             ltAddressLine1gt6384 RED DRltAddressLine1gt             ltCitygtMIAMIltCitygt             ltStateOrRegiongtFLltStateOrRegiongt             ltPostalCodegt78457ltPostalCodegt             ltCountryCodegtUSltCountryCodegt             ltPhonegt5478975487ltPhone                           ltOrdergt     ltOrdersgt ltListOrdersResultgt codepre  pMy codeforeachcode loop uses the zip method to iterate through both collections in parallel, however when it gets to the double order, everything becomes off.p  precodeforeach var address in addresses.Zipproducts, a, b gt new a, b          if string.Equalsaddress.b.Title, denatAlcohol, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase              execute code if product title is a match           if string.Equalsaddress.b.Title, sodiumChlorate, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase              execute code if product title is a match          if string.Equalsaddress.b.Title, semiNitric, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase              execute code if product title is a match          if string.Equalsaddress.b.Title, leserNitric, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase              execute code if product title is a match          if stringArray.Anyaddress.b.Title.Contains              execute code if product title is a match                                  if address.b.Title.Equalsisopropyl              execute code if product title is a match                     if address.b.Title.EqualshazNitric              execute code if product title is matchg               if address.a.AddressLine2  null              execute code with info in collection a for shipping address info          else              execute code with info in collection a for shipping address info       codepre
Negative 53504 pI am importing data from an Excel file into a Filemaker Pro database FMP 12.0 v5 for Mac. I am using the imported data to Update matching records in found set. However, the field that I am using to match occasionally contains trailing zeros.p  pWhen importing, FMP does not match the fields correctly, because it ignores the trailing zeros. p  pTo explain further the field in the database is a calculated text field, courseID.personID, determined by concatenating the numerical courseID and personID fields with a dot in between them. The field in my Excel file is formed similarly, using Excel formulae. Some personID values end in a zero, e.g. 120, and so courseID.personID becomes something like 123.120. I am matching the Excel field to the FMP field.p  pI first noticed this was happening, and was very careful to go back to Excel and make a new file to start fresh, select all cells and set format to Text. Then, I did a Paste Special from my original data, and selected Paste as Values. All the cells in the courseID.personID column gave a number stored as text error, with the option to convert the text to numbers. I selected the option to ignore the error, to leave all the data stored as text, with the intention of preserving the trailing zeros. p  pAlas, the issue persists. So, does anyone have any ideas of how to force Excel to format and communicate the proper values Or, is it an issue of making FMP interpret the data properly, maybe by adjusting field typesp

Negative 53504 pIm trying to build Android 5.0 for the Sony Xperia Z3 leo using AOSP sources and the vendor binaries provided by Sony on their Developer World website SWbinariesforXperiaAOSPLMR0v8. emSystemem, emBootem, emRecoveryem, emCacheem and emUserdataem images are all built properly and I am able to flash them on an actual device.p  pHowever, strongeach time the phone is restarted, the systems Date amp Time settings are resetstrong to the default, a fixed day in 1970.p  pFrom my past experience with builds for Google Nexus devices, this kind of issue is often caused by outdated or incomplete vendor files.p  pI attempted to build using the vendor from the software binaries available on the Github project a hrefhttpsgithub.comsonyxperiadevdevicesonyleo relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsonyxperiadevdevicesonyleoa, which is v7 I believe, instead of the version available in direct download, with no luck same issue.p  pHas anyone encountered andor solved this issuep  pIs there a version of the software binaries I am missing, or do I need to tweak something in the sourcep  pAny help will be appreciated.p
Negative 53504 pThis is very weird.p  pWhen I send data to a TCP server, with a TCP client. It corrupts the data, for some extremely odd, and quite annoying reason.p  pHere is the server codep  precodeTcpListener lis  new TcpListenerIPAddress.Any, 9380  it needs to be 9380, crucial lis.Start Socket sk  lis.AcceptSocket byte[] pd  new byte[sk.ReceiveBufferSize] sk.Receivepd   cd is the current directory, filename is the file, ex picture.png,   that was previously sent to the server with UDP.

Extreme, sometimes I would upload a 5KB file, but when the server receives and writes the file I send it, it would turn out crazy like 2 bytes. Or it would be 8KB instead Applications send through this wont even run, pictures show errors, ect.p  pI would like to note, however, with this, client  server fails, on the other hand, server  client works. Strange. p  pBtw, in case you are interested this is for sending files... Also, using .NET 4.5. Also, my network is extremely reliable.p
Negative 53504 pSo, im new to spring and Im following this tutorial on spring mvc a hrefhttpjeromejaglale.comdocspring4tutorialmvcwebapplication relnofollowhttpjeromejaglale.comdocspring4tutorialmvcwebapplicationap  pThat shows you how to create a website using spring mvc and display a list of cars. I have this working but I want to extend it so that the website isnt displaying a static list of cars. p  pInstead, I want the CarService to be more of a structure that can be updated dynamically so cars can be added and deleted. I have the CarService defined as a bean and I would like to just grab it when the controller asks for it.  The issue im running into, is how do I startup the web server and start my spring application that will start up the CarService so that we can add and remove separately from the web app p  pAny guidancetutorials on the best way to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 53504 pLets say I have a data template that has 3 field sections Basic Info, Navigation Info and Content Info.  I would like to restrict Field Write access to the fields in these sections by role.  I know that it is fairly simple to create a role for each of these and deny Field Write for the other sections.  For example, I could create a role called Basic Info Editor Role and deny Field Write for all of the fields in the Navigation Info and Content Info sections.  However I need to have the ability for a given user to be a member of more than one role sometimes.  So I may have a user called jSmith that is a member of both the Basic Info Editor Role and also the Navigation Info Editor Role.  I want jSmith to be able to edit both of those sections of content.p  pI cant figure out how to do this.  It seems that by default all users have Field Write access to all templates.  I think somehow I need to remove inheritance so that they dont all have the Field Write granted or something.  Any ideasp

Negative 53504 pFor a project that I am doing I am trying to essentially convert an mp3 file into vibrations. I have talked to staff at SparkFun Electronics who set me up with the Lilypad Vibe Board and the Arduino Uno. It is in my understanding that with the Arduino Uno its unable to read an MP3 file and convert it into PWM so that the Lilypad Vibe Board can produce the vibrations. Does anyone know if there is any code or another device that will allow me to do this I have researched the Raspberry Pi but am also unsure as to if this will work in the way i would like it to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. My aim is to take an mp3 file, convert it into PWM so that the Lilypad Vibe Board would be able to create the vibrations in relation to the mp3 file. p
