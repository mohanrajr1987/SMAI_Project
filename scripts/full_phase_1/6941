Positive 6941 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI have read that the Leap motion sensor is supposed to be capable of 0.01 mm measurements of hand gestures.  I dont see how that is possible if the depth images are only 8bit images 256 values at 0.01 mm per value would only yield like an inch of measurement range, which is clearly not the case.  Ive read through the API for the Leap Motion sensor, I dont see any configurable settings that would yield, say, a 16bit depth image, which I would expect from a sensor claiming 0.01 mm measurements see a hrefhttpwww.extremetech.comcomputing129638theleapgesturecontrollikekinectbutcheaperandmuchhigherresolution relnofollowthis sitea for that claim.  strongDoes anybody know a way to increase the bitdepth of the depth images from the Leap Motion sensorstrongp  pstrongContext of problemstrongp  pI am trying to use a Leap Motion sensor as a cheap 3D scanner.  I want to measure the position and tilt of a 3D printer head with it.  I think I can fake better resolution by analyzing many points across the surface, but if it is possible to get 16 bit resolution of the depth image, I would much prefer that.p  pI am not against using a different sensor if that is whats called for, but I am aware of other SO questions in that vein.p

Positive 6941 pI wrote this function in PHP for changing a picture from one color to another, and I really like it. To me, it looks very realistic for my purposes, and it seems to take the brightness of the original image into consideration pretty well. But, its slow. With the image sizes Im working with, it takes about 23 seconds to recolor one image. I know the speed bump is from looping through every pixel, so I tried out some different combinations of Imagemagick functions through the Imagick class, but I couldnt find any combo that I liked the results of as much as my function. Is there a way, maybe using C, that I can write this as some sort of plugin for Imagemagick, and even make it available through the Imagick class so I dont have to run it through something like exec I also tried using Imagicks PixelIterator, and looked at fxImage, but those were just as slow if not worse.p  precodepublic function colorizeimg, rgb      imagealphablendingimg, true     imagesavealphaimg, true       get width and height of image     iwidth  imagesximg     iheight  imagesyimg       loop through each pixel     for y0 yltiheight y for x0 xltiwidth x           get all original r, g, b, a values of the pixel         orgb  imagecoloratimg, x, y         oa  orgb gtgt 24 amp 0xFF         or  orgb gtgt 16 amp 0xFF         og  orgb gtgt 8 amp 0xFF         ob  orgb amp 0xFF           add up orginal rgb values and new rgb values         totaloriginal  or  og  ob         totalnew  rgb[0]  rgb[1]  rgb[2]           adjust brightness using average of rgb channels         bright  127  totalnew3          take average difference between new colors brightness and old colors brightness, add brightness adjustment to it, and round         adjustment  roundbright  totalnew  totaloriginal  3           set each channel to new color channels, add the adjustment, and make sure the result isnt less than 0 or greater than 255         r  max0,minadjustment  rgb[0],255         g  max0,minadjustment  rgb[1],255         b  max0,minadjustment  rgb[2],255           replace original pixel         nrgb  imagecolorallocatealphaimg, r, g, b, oa         imagesetpixelimg, x, y, nrgb       codepre

Currently it includes exif dates and filenames. We are adding geotags to it. One feature we are really interested in, is having images grouped based on codesimilaritycode.

I conceptually understand that you can potentially select the entire area by finding the four corner with the internal angles, but Im pretty clueless on how to implement that. Secondly is there a particular template matching algorithm that would be best for this type of work Id rather do some more processing prior to template matching rather than brute force matching with multiple types of the same image rotated and scaled to account for the differences in each photo.p  pSo summary do I need to do some more processing for scale and orientation before matching and if so, suggested algorithms, and what template matching algorithm would be the best approach for this problemp  pI think the ideal solution is finding the entire card and forming a separate image where it is scaled and positioned for template matching and then using a matching algorithm, but Im not sure thats even possible Any help is most appreciated.p

And finding faster or   optimal code, happens later.. this Q is really about the earliest   phase of writing code.p blockquote  pI try to understand how image blob detection works.  I am looking for some code explanations, preferable in c.  There are several methods I read about. The most simple one might be a binary kinda filter working on black and white images. As explained here a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiConnectedcomponentlabeling relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiConnectedcomponentlabelingap  pHowever that doesnt solve it for me.  My images are not black and white, they contain more variations which i cannt split in 2. And I need to apply some rules at blob detection level that some colours belong to the same group only if they match some logic based upon color info in that blob, despite being visual complete distinct. p  pIve looked at Aforge and tested it EmguCV, OpenCV, and Ive seen examples of Matlab but I dont have Matlab. However since my image data isnt that good for those filters, as I would later like to add even more extra visual logic  future detecting  color rules etc. p  pSo then I red about people sometimes write their own blob filters and this is what I am now interested in. However besides the Wikipedia article I couldnt find some readable programmers material about this subject. I did find things for mathlab, and some heavy mathematical articles about blob  future detecting. What i am looking for are some other methods like the Wikipedia article showing some different approaches to blob detection, explained in code. So that i based on such knowledge can create one too.p  pIf someone could point me to some articles where people describe  different filter methods, and isnt about existing aforgeopencv etc. Then i gladly like to learn it.p

Positive 6941 pI am going to build an emotion recognition system based on Paul Ekmans emotion model  happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral using STASM and OpenCVs SVM with video clips as the source.p  pHowever, I have no clue about what kind of data that should be fed for the training phase itself. I know that we have to input a codeMatcode type to the SVM, but Im wondering what should be included in the matrix.p  pFor example, suppose we have landmark points that we get from STASM. Each landmark point has its own code[x,y]code coordinate. Furthermore, each face expression has many landmarks points, lets say we cover 17 landmark points. That means after knowing those 17 landmark points for one face expression, we will wrap this data to the first row of the matrix data type and feed it into the SVM and then the process is the same for other expressions we should label them too but lets not focus on that part first.p  pMy questionp  ol listrongIs feeding the x and y coordinates of the landmark points for the system enoughstrong brli ol  pIntuitively I dont think it is enough. We should get some sort of displacement from a neutral expression to a peak expression described in this paper a hrefhttpwww.cs.cmu.edupmichelpublicationsMichelCSTDissertation.pdf relnofollowherea. For example, we can get the Euclidean distance of each landmark point from a neutral state to a happy state and feed the strongdisplacements of the coordinatesstrong to the matrix, instead of the coordinates.p  pBut I feel like there is still something missing with this idea. p  ol start2 listrongIf every expression is compared to the neutral state, then how can the machine know if someones face is in a neutral statestrong brli ol  pI am confused because I dont know to what should the neutral expression comparison be based on since other expressions actually use neutral expression as the comparison. p

Positive 6941 pI have four cameras, mounted on a steel plate in a square pattern two rows of two. I would like to calibrate these cameras to determine the intrinsic parameters, and the relative positions of the camera. I can obtain the intrinsic parameters using openCVs calibrateCamera.p  pTypically I would use stereoCalibrate for calibration of two cameras. I could do the same here, but I would prefer a more scalable solution.p  pMy question is, how do I stereoCalibrate more that two cameras, with the known constraint that they are all mounted on the same plane One option is to solvePnP, but this ignores the planar constraint.p

Positive 6941 pI would like to generate 3D white objects in blackwhite images using Matlabs nlfilter or a similar functiontool. p  pIn 2D, I start with some white seed points, which eventually define the regionsobjects in my 2D image. By applying nlfilter successively, I can naturally grow these regions until all pixels are labeled. Id like to do a similar thing in 3D, but nlfilter works only on 2D images. Treating a 3D image as a stack of 2D images and applying nlfilter on each such slice is one of the possible ways to overcome this problem, but its not suboptimal. Instead, an nlfilter3d function would have been much more convenient.  Does any similar function exist in Matlab or elsewherep

Positive 6941 pI am implementing Lowes method, SIFT, for finding and describing features in an image.p  pI have found interest points, and now I have to describe them Using Lowes method, I have calculated the magnitude and gradient in an area around the keypoint, and created a Gauss weighted histogram, with 36 bins, each corresponding to an orientation of 10 degrees. For each keypoint, there is a histogram. Each bin is the sum of the weighted magnitude, in that direction. An example taken from aishack.in a hrefhttpwww.aishack.instaticimgtutsiftorientationhistogram.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.aishack.instaticimgtutsiftorientationhistogram.jpgap  pBins within 80 the size of the maximum bin, is made a new keypoint. After describing, it says in the paper Finally, a parabola is fit to the 3 histogram values closest to each peak to interpolate the peak position for better accuracy. I am not sure i get this. p  pIn my understanding, it means the peak, the left, and the right value of that peak, will have a parabola fit, like thisbe warned Drawn free handp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7V8pb.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com7V8pb.jpgap  pand the orientation of the keypoint will be where the extremum of the parabola  is. For instance If the parabola fitted at 1019, 2029, and 3039 with 2029 being the histogram peak, had extremum at a point, that reached in the 3039, then this would be the orientation of that keypoint. Am i understanding this correctly In this way, the orientation of the keypoint, can only be within 36 orientationsp  pAnother option Same idea as above, only the histogram is no longer discrete the extremum of the parapola will thus be a continuous value, and this value is assigned to the keypoint.p

Negative 6941 pMy company is going to be storing sensitive data for our customers, and will be encrypting data using one of the managed .NET encryption algorithm classes. Most of the work is done, but we havent figured out howwhere to store the key. Ive done some light searching and reading, and it seems like a hardware solution might be the most secure. Does anyone have any recommendations on a key storage solution or methodp  hr  pThanks for your replies, everyone.p  pspoulson, the issue is actually both the scopes that you mentioned. I suppose I should have been clearer.p  pThe data itself, as well as the logic that encrypts it and decrypts it is abstracted away into an ASP.NET profile provider. This profile provider allows both encrypted profile properties as well as plain text ones. The encrypted property values are stored in exactly the same way the plain text ones are  with the obvious exception that theyve been encrypted.p  pThat said, the key will need to be able to be summoned for one of three reasonsp  ol liThe authorized web application, running on an authorized server, needs to encrypt data.li liSame as 1, but for decrypting the data.li liAuthorized members of our business team need to view the encrypted data.li ol  pThe way Im imagining it is that nobody would ever actually know the key  there would be a piece of software controlling the actual encrypting and decrypting of data. That said, the key still needs to come from emsomewhereem.p  pFull disclosure  if you couldnt already tell, Ive never done anything like this before, so if Im completely off base in my perception of how this should work, by all means, let me know.p

Negative 6941 pI am working on a large application that manages complex events with quite a bit of data.p  pThe application is broken into a client C mainly .NET 2.0 mainly, a WCF based server made to run on IIS web services at this layer, and a data back end that is NHibernate based with an MS SQL Server database backend.p  pWe are encountering a bug with the follow scenariop  pMultiple users in this case 6, in our testing simultaneously save a persisted object such as an event on the client. This is done via a verbal countdown, so were talking a second or so difference due to reaction timesp  pWhen they save objects on the client, the client calls the server to save that object. The server does any business logic required, and then commits the change via NHibernate.p  pIn this situation multiple saves over service calls some clients will come back with an unhanded exceptionp  pRow was updated or deleted by another transactionp  pWhich is an NHibernate exception.p  pIn my research I found some instances of this error, but it was always sequential. Our application is fine sequentially, this only happens with simultaneous saves.p  pHow should multiple simultaneous NHibernate transactions be protected from each otherp  pThis is going to be a high volume application, so minimal needed locking is good. We cant afford to lock all saves generally.p  pAre there NHibernate settings that would do this Do we need to figure out some server code side locking before hand Can the database handle this with perhaps with different transaction protection settingsp  pThis is a bear to test, like most threading issues, hence the researchtheory approach. What is the experience with an architecture like thisp  pEdit Further information and a theory.p  pIt seems that changing values that are directly in the table as the main entity did not cause this problem, while changing elements that are accessed through a join did. In this case a set of attributes.p  pOur working theory that seems to fit this situation is the followingp  pMultiple saves come in for the same event. Each one gets a copy of the existing event to modify. The first ones to save are OK. The later ones, however, have updates such as the addition or deletion of attributes which are a join table and discover that the add or delete that needs done has already been done, and bails out because another transaction edited the event.p  pHow should we keep these events in syncp

Negative 6941 pThis may be waaay to specific for SO, but there seems to be a dearth of info on the sun raster standard.  a hrefhttpsteve.hollasch.netcgindexformatssunraster.html relnofollowEven JWZ is frustrated by thisap  pstrongIntrostrong The a hrefhttpwww.fileformat.infoformatsunrasteregff.htm relnofollowSun raster standarda says that rows of pixels have padding at the end such that the number of bits in a row is a factor of 16 i.e. an even number of bytes.  For example, if you had a 7pixelwide 24bit image, a row would normally take 7  3  21 bytes, but sun raster would pad it to 22 bytes so the number of bits is divisible by 16.  The code below achieves this for 24bit images of arbitrary widthp  precoderowbytelength  numcols  3 rowbytelength  widthinbytes  2 codepre  pstrongHeres my questionstrong both Imagemagick and Gimp follow this rule for 24bit images, but for 32bit images it does something weird that I dont understand.  Since the bit depth gives 4byte pixels, any image width would take an even number of bytes per row, which always complies with the 16bit alignment rule.  But when they compute the row length, they add an extra byte for images with odd widths, making the row length odd i.e. the number of bits for the row is not divisible by 16.  The code below describes what theyre doing for 32bit imagesp  precoderowbytelength  numcols  4  numcols  2 codepre  pAdding one appears to go against the 16bit alignment rule as specified by the sun format, and is done with no apparent purpose.  However, Im sure if Gimp and Imagemagick do it this way, I must be misreading the sun raster spec.p  pAre there any Sun raster experts out there who know why this is done p  pstrongEditstrong My mistake, Gimp only outputs up to 24 bit Sun raster.  Looks like this is only an Imagemagick issue, so probably a bug.  Im labeling this for closure better to discuss on the ImageMagick forums.p

Negative 6941 pIm setting up a form in which multiple entries can potentially be made via an Add more button for one of the qestions. Im trying to figure out the best way to make this accessible without javascript and also to allow the input fields to be shown dynamically each time the Add button is clicked. There are 3 pieces of data i need to collect for each entry, below is the basics of what the HTML will look likep  precodeType ltinput name  type[] id  type gt Sub type ltinput name  subtype[] id  type gt Number ltinput name  num[] id  type gt codepre  pI dont have a problem with the JS code required to create this content dynamically on each click of the Add button, but I am thinking that as it is reasonable to set a limit on the amount of rows a person could add for this type of data, 10 entries would be the very maximum i would expect, I could just add ten empty fields to the HTML form. Then, my jQuery code would hide them on domready, then each time the Add button is clicked, it simply shows the next available empty field on the form until it gets to the 10th, at which point the Add button is disabled.p  pDoes this approach make any sensep

Negative 6941 pIts a generic question and really a newbie one too, so bear with me...p  pIm playing with some iPhone development, and trying to create a simple flip type application. Nothing sophisticated, lets say on the flip side is a short application summary, bit like help and on the main screen is a simple board game, lets say tictactoe or similar.p  pNow, XCode has generated me Main View, Flipside View and Application Delegate folders, with default template files in them.p  pNow the question is where do I create appropriate MVC classesp  pLets say View classes are going to be the ones that have been automatically created. So the Flipside view class is responsible for generating textimages etc on the help view.p  pMain View class is what draws the items on the table and updates the counters, etc.p  pWhere should I place the controller class And also, should it only be dealing with proxying only to the model According a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.commaclibrarydocumentationCocoaConceptualCocoaFundamentalsCocoaDesignPatternsCocoaDesignPatterns.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40002974CH6SW1 relnofollowto thisa the controller method is called from the view and manipulates the method classes. Similarly, the results from model are passed back to the view class by the controller issuing the calls to appropriate view methods.p  pSimilarly, where does the model class go or should I just create a new folder for each, controller and model class filesp  pWhat Im after is the best practices, or just a short description how people normally structure their applications. I know its very specific and also undefined... I came from Django background, so the way stuff is organised there is slightly different.p  pHope this makes sense, sorry if its all bit vague, but I have to start somewhere  And yes Ive read quite few docs on the apple developer site, but trouble is that the documents are either going into too much detail about the languageframeworketc and the examples are way too simplistic. Actually, this leads me to the final question, has anyone know any good example of relatively complete application tutorial which I could use as a reference in organising my files...p  pbUPDATEb I was looking at a hrefhttpicodeblog.com20090115iphonegameprogrammingtutorialpart1 relnofollowthisa as an example. But what happens there, is that all game variables, such as ball speed etc are store in the view controller class. So basically embedding the model into controller. And what about the View theres no View classes there nor in the default XCode created project, should I assume that the View  NIB If so, then where do I create objects programatically Is that supposed to happen in the controllerp

Negative 6941 pI have a PHP CLI script mostly written that functions as a chat server for chat clients to connect to dont ask me why Im doing it in PHP, thats another story haha. p  pMy script utilizes the socketselect function to hang execution until something happens on a socket, at which point it wakes up, processes the event, and waits until the next event. Now, there are some routine tasks that I need performed every 30 seconds or so check if tempbanned users should be unbanned, save user databases, other assorted things. p  pFrom what I can tell, PHP doesnt have very great multithreading support at all. My first thought was to compare a timestamp every time the socket generates an event and gets the program flowing again, but this is very inconsistent since the server could very well sit idle for hours and not have any of my cleanup routines executed. p  pI came across the PHP pcntl extensions, and it lets me use assign a time interval for SIGALRM to get sent and a function get executed every time its sent. This seems like the ideal solution to my problem, however pcntlalarm and socketselect clash with each other pretty bad. Every time SIGALRM is triggered, all sorts of crazy things happen to my socket control code.p  pMy program is fairly lengthy so I cant post it all here, but it shouldnt matter since I dont believe Im doing anything wrong codewise. My question is Is there any way for a SIGALRM to be handled in the same thread as a waiting socketselect If so, how If not, what are my alternatives herep  pHeres some output from my program.

Negative 6941 pI am currently running a small java class for scientific calculations on graphs which internally creates lots of huge collections from within Eclipse on MacOSX Snow Leopard. I have a Macbook with 2GB of RAM and to successfully run the app without OutOfMemory Error I need to run it from eclipse with Xmx1200m I know this is very much.p  pIt takes about 500seconds to do all the computations I need to run and it also uses up all the memory I have given it I monitored it with macosx progress monitor and it goes to 1,2GB for Real Memp  pAfter this application is done my MacOSX is almost unusable. Even if I close Eclipse everything becomes sluggish and slow. I also notice that whatever I do afterwards even after closing Eclipse that e.g. Finder navigation is very slow. It takes ages to render some folders or to change directories. Sometimes I restart the system to be able to work again efficiently. p  pI would like to understand what is happening in the background when this happens I was under the impression, that when a java class  app has finished running, that the Garbage Collector at least at the end will cleanup everything and I would have expected that other programs are free to use this memory again. But it feels like a memory leak which affects the whole system, even if the Java app is not running anymore.p  pI would appreciate any hints or readings in this direction. p

Negative 6941 pThis is a baffling one. My ASP.NET 3.5 app that was working fine suddenly started getting timeout errors...p  pstrongSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException Timeout expired.

And this issue that came on suddenly by itself and lasted most of the day errors started getting logged at 617am suddenly resolved itself around 430pm.p  pIt seemed to be acting as if there was a network routing issue between this one web server and this one database server, but only with a particular set of SQL credentials.

Ive defined a method codemyMethodcode in codeFirstViewController.mcode file, then in codeviewDidLoadcode I call the method with code[self myMethod]code.p  pWhen I built and ran from the Console, I got nothing. So I put codeNSLogcode statements like sop  precodevoid viewDidLoad  NSLogEntering viewDidLoad [self myMethod] NSLogCalled myMethod [super viewDidLoad]  codepre  pThe Console never returns the second NSLog statement, leading me to believe that the app crashes while calling the method.p  pIve tried this with the simulator set to iOS 4.0.1 as well as iOS 4.1. Im building against the iOS 4.1 SDK. I really appreciate any help you can offer.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I ran the Debugger, which seems to show the problem being in codemyMethodcode.

Negative 6941 pMy requirement is to provide a shared memory file between 32 bit and 64 bit processes. This file can be created by any of the process depends upon who comes first.   I am still not sure if this is possible and if so, any pitfalls later  some info got from google  MemoryMapped Files 32bit applications can only share memorymapped files that are mapped into a 32bit virtual address space. 64bit applications can share memorymapped files in a 32bit or 64bit virtual address space. To map a file into memory that is shareable between 64bit and 32bit applications, your 64bit application must specify the MAPADDR32 flag with the MAPSHARED flag when invoking mmap2.

The Fortran version appears to be buggy it does exactly 1 compare and ends up exiting if they are already sorted so my primary focus is to get a working version to study.p

Negative 6941 pIve written a loggerexceptionfactory module, which uses System.Diagnostics.StackTrace, to get attributes from calling methods and their declaring types. However I noticed, that if I run the code outside of Visual Studio in Release mode, some of my shorter methods get inlined and missing from the stack trace. Now I have no way to test whether a method will get inlined in runtime, but I do not want to code[MethodImplMethodImplOptions.NoInlining]code every important method. But if a method from my base classes will be missing because of it, I can misread the layer and operation information and that could lead to false log or misparameterized exceptions.   p  pIs there a rule of thumb what gets inlined where and when Are virtual methods, static methods, base class methods treated any differently Do I only have to worry about inlining inside assembly Inside namespace p

Now I want to modify the Person.  I know I can do this by loading the Person, changing properties, and then saving.  But what I want to do instead, which seems to me like it ought to work, is thisp  precodevar c  new Context var e  c.EmployeeTypes.Singlex gt x.Text.Equalssecond var p  new Person               Key  originalKey,        same key             FirstName  NewFirst,   new first name             LastName  NewLast,     new last name             EmployeeType  e        new employee type c.Entryp.State  EntityState.Modified c.SaveChanges codepre  pOddly, this changes FirstName and LastName but not EmployeeType.  If I get a new Context and request this Person, the EmployeeType remains set to first as it was before this code ran.p  pstrongWhat do I need to do to get the navigation properties to update, and not just the scalar propertiesstrong  This is especially puzzling because for EmployeeType, the only thing that actually needs to change is the foreign key in the Person table, and that key is a scalar property.p  pBy the way, I know I can do this by retrieving the Person first, then changing properties onebyone, but as Im using model binding in ASP.NET MVC, it seems like this way would be easier because Ill have the updated person object already in my POST method.p
Negative 6941 pAs a matter of best practices, Im trying to determine if its better to create a function and codeapplycode it across a matrix, or if its better to simply loop a matrix through the function. I tried it both ways and was surprised to find codeapplycode is slower. The task is to take a vector and evaluate it as either being positive or negative and then return a vector with 1 if its positive and 1 if its negative. The codemashcode function loops and the codesquishcode function is passed to the codeapplycode function.p  precodemillion  lt as.matrixrnorm100000  mash lt functionx  fori in 1NROWx ifx[i] gt 0 x[i] lt 1 else x[i] lt 1 returnx   squish lt functionx  ifx gt0 return1 else return1    ptm lt proc.time loopmillion lt mashmillion proc.time  ptm   ptm lt proc.time applymillion lt applymillion,1, squish proc.time  ptm codepre  pcodeloopmillioncode resultsp  precodeuser  system elapsed  0.468   0.008   0.483  codepre  pcodeapplymillioncode resultsp  precodeuser  system elapsed  1.401   0.021   1.423  codepre  pWhat is the advantage to using codeapplycode over a codeforcode loop if performance is degraded Is there a flaw in my test I compared the two resulting objects for a clue and foundp  precodegt classapplymillion [1] numeric gt classloopmillion [1] matrix codepre  pWhich only deepens the mystery. The codeapplycode function cannot accept a simple numeric vector and thats why I cast it with codeas.matrixcode in the beginning. But then it returns a numeric. The codeforcode loop is fine with a simple numeric vector. And it returns an object of same class as that one passed to it. p

Negative 6941 pHey all.  Im trying to optimize a Linq to Entities call by statically caching and reusing a compiled query.  The query checks the same thing for a variable number of filter arguments, and the only way to compile query arguments like that is to explicitly use a number of arguments rather than some Containstype logic, which in SQL cant be parameterized.p  pThis works great and gives me a major performance boost.

Negative 6941 pI am just learning JQM and have had some good guidance from this forum. However, one thing that puzzles me is, do I have to do any special markup to php files. For example, i have a html5 file that collects info via a form and uses ajax to process the form and send to secure php file. for some reason, the login denies or accepts on, but instead of showing secure.php after successful login, it just stays at the html page. This is just a tutorial I am following, but it gives me a chance to study the code in more detail and try to move forward. Can someone please help with this many thanksp  precodeltDOCTYPEgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt     lttitlegtLogistor Loginlttitlegt     ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetiso88591gt     ltlink hrefhttpcode.jquery.commobilelatestjquery.mobile.min.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.6.2.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt     ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.commobilelatestjquery.mobile.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt       function              loginform.submitfunction                       remove all the class add the messagebox classes and start fading                     msgbox.removeClass.addClassmessagebox.textValidating.....fadeIn1000             check the username exists or not from ajax             .postajaxlogin.php, usernameusername.val,passwordpassword.val,randMath.random  ,functiondata                              ifdatayes if correct login detail                                      msgbox.fadeTo200,0.1,function  start fading the messagebox                                                add message and change the class of the box and start fading                         this.htmlLogging in......addClassmessageboxok.fadeTo900,1,                         function                                                        redirect to secure page                               document.locationsecure.php                                                                                else                                      msgbox.fadeTo200,0.1,function start fading the messagebox                                               add message and change the class of the box and start fading                         this.htmlPlease provide the correct credentials.addClassmessageboxerror.fadeTo900,1                                                                return false not to post the  form physically                  now call the ajax also focus move from         password.blurfunction                      loginform.triggersubmit                   ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltdiv datarolepage idlogin datatitleLogistor Login datathemebgt     ltdiv dataroleheadergt         lth1gtLogistor Loginlth1gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv datarolecontentgt         ltform methodpost idloginform actiongt             ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt                 ltlabel forusernamegtUsername ltlabelgt                 ltinput typetext nameusername idusername value size66 gt                 ltdiv iduserErrorgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt                 ltlabel forpasswordgtPassword ltlabelgt                 ltinput typepassword namepassword idpassword value size46 gt                 ltdiv idpassErrorgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idloginmessagegtltdivgt             ltdiv idsubmitDiv datarolefieldcontaingt                 ltinput nameSubmit typesubmit idsubmit valueLogin datainlinetrue gt                  ltspan idmsgbox styledisplaynonegtltspangt             ltdivgt         ltformgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv datarolefootergt     lth4gtLogistor 20092011lth4gt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  psecure.phpp  precodeltphp sessionstart    if session is not set redirect the user ifemptySESSION[uname]     headerLocationindex.html    if logout then destroy the session and redirect the user ifissetGET[logout]      sessiondestroy     headerLocationindex.html      echo lta hrefsecure.phplogoutgtltbgtLogoutltbgtltagt echo ltdiv aligncentergtYou Are inside secured Pageltagt  gt codepre  pajaxlogin.phpp  precodeltphp sessionstart   Connect to database from here link  mysqlconnectlocalhost, root,  if link      dieCould not connect  . mysqlerror  select the database  Change the name of database from here mysqlselectdbtest  get the posted values usernamehtmlspecialcharsPOST[username],ENTQUOTES passmd5POST[password]  now validating the username and password sqlSELECT usernameusr, passwordusr FROM userusr WHERE usernameusr.username. resultmysqlquerysql rowmysqlfetcharrayresult  if username exists ifmysqlnumrowsresultgt0      compare the password     ifstrcmprow[passwordusr],pass0              echo yes         now set the session from here if needed         SESSION[uname]username          else         echo no  else     echo no Invalid Login   gt codepre

Negative 6941 pI am carefully assessing the best way to utilize a hrefhttpwww.modernizr.comModernizra and a hrefhttpsgithub.comscottjehlRespondreadmeRespond.jsa for responsive design and have a couple of questions for the community.p  pFirstly, it is my understanding that when bundling Modernizr with Respond.js, no other coding or tests are required for media query support in IE8 and below. In other words, when Respond.js is bundled with Modernizr I merely have to load Modernizr in my source to get Respond.js active. Correctp  pSecondly, do you believe this is the most efficient way to achieve support for media queries in IE8 and below In essence, I would be including a larger Modernizr script than is needed for browsers that already support media queries. Wouldnt it be more efficient to separate the two scripts and only load Respond.js if a test for media queries failsp  pThird, if I would like to separate the two scripts, what do you believe is the best way to load Respond.js if needed One option would be to use an IE specific conditional comment to load Respond. Another option is to use yepnope and Modernizr to test for media query support and load Respond if needed. Which would be more efficient and faultproof.p  pLastly, if I choose to separate the two scripts and use Modernizr to load Respond if needed I have encountered the two following techniquesp  precodeltscriptgt         yepnope     test  Modernizr.mqonly all,     nope  [jslibsrespond.min.js]  ltscriptgt codepre  pORp  precodeltscriptgtModernizr.mqminwidth0  document.writeltscript srcjslibsrespond.min.jsgtltscriptgtltscriptgt codepre  pI have found that the second crashes IE8, but must just need rewriting.

Im not sure how to do this either. pli ol  pObviously the images are just made for your purpose. Once the user has resized their image and moved it to the correct position, they will be press download, where the canvas will convert to png and save to the server, and then download to the user.

Negative 6941 pIve been working on a project where a date is calculated based on a number of days added to current DateTime.Now. Im using several functions based on this work a hrefhttptinyurl.com884kojy relnofollowbusiness dates calculationa , and since this requires a calculation of business days no weekend days or holidays are calculated, holidays are coded to an app config file, the count needs to start on the current date now, or the previous business day if start is on a weekend day or holiday. The emcurrentem class file always moves emaheadem to the next business day before starting the count. If the start date is today, the count will start tomorrow.p  pMy requirements for example a start day of 1212012 is a Saturday. A value of 10 days is added. The resulting date emshould beem February 2. This means the business day to start a calculation is Friday January 20  9 more days  10 days. Another example would be to set the start on Sunday January 22, stepping back to January 20, and add 9 days with the same result. Provided The count does not start on weekends or holidays, it should skip them and arrive at the next calculated business day.p  pThe issue Im having is my project needs to calculate based on the current date, or step back to the previous business day if the count start is a weekend or holiday.p  pI think the class file is very clear, but I cant seem to find a way to force the count to start on the current business day, or step backward to the previous business day if the count start is a weekend or holiday. p  pPlease have a look at the code in the link.

Negative 6941 pI have a static class where I keep a large number of relative paths that are used in different places in my application.

I need to keep them all together because it allows me to easily control what files are used by my application and change their locations from time to time. p  pHowever even though they are organized in alphabetic order and its easy to find a certain path, I need to be able to change some of them depending on some setting. Lets say, there is a setting bool SettingA and when I turn it on, I have to do modify some of the paths to use a different directory or a different file name. p  pThe problem is that now I cant use constants, I have to rewrite my code to properties or methods so that I can change file paths at runtime. And here where my code becomes much bigger in size and the strict order now looks ugly. Is there a way I can group them, so that it will not confuse anybody who uses this code I cant break them into a separate classes because it is difficult to remember in what class what constant you may keep. For now Im grouping them by regions, but I have a bad feeling that keeping more than one hundred of properties in one class is wrong.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pAll directories and files that I declare in codeFilePathConstantscode are used in a large number of places in application each path can be used multiple times, taking into account the fact that there is more then one hundred of paths  this is a large number.

Negative 6941 pI am using a perlin noise function to generate data for a game I am making, but for some reason it keeps returning the exact same results for different inputs. I spent like 4 hours trying to debug this on my FBM function and couldnt figure it out so I tried Ken Perlins improved noise function and the same thing happens.p  pDoes anyone know why this is What is a good way to fix it The only thing I have been able to do is add a decimal value like .6473 to the x and y coordinates, which helped, but introduced other problems such as the values repeating themselves inside the arrays.p  pHere is some test code. I am trying to create two different 2D arrays filled with noise values. The x and y inputs are coordinates from my game. On the lines with strongememstrong after them, if I dont increase those values, both arrays will be filled with all zeros. In the example, the coordinates 0.0, 768.0 and 1024.0, 768.0 return the exact same noise values. In my game, 9 different coordinates return the same values.p  pThe Perlin Noise function I am using for this test is a hrefhttpmrl.nyu.eduperlinnoise relnofollowhereap  precodepublic class TestPerlinMain      public static void mainString[] args               int seed  532434          create first noise array         double x  0.0    xcoordinate         double y  768.0 ycoordinate         float z  10.0f          double[][] test  new double[15][15]          System.out.printlnNoise Array 1           forint i  0 i lt test.length i                      forint j  0 j lt test[i].length j                              test[i][j]  ImprovedNoise.noisex  j  64.0, y  i  64.0, 10.0                 x  .314f                  System.out.printtest[i][j]                             y  .314f                   System.out.println          create 2nd noise array         double x2  1024.0 x coordinate         double y2  768.0  y coordinate         float z2  10.0f              System.out.println          double[][] test2  new double[15][15]          System.out.printlnNoise Array 2           forint i  0 i lt test2.length i                      forint j  0 j lt test2[i].length j                              test2[i][j]  ImprovedNoise.noisex2  j  64.0, y2  i  64.0, 10.0                 x2  .314f                  System.out.printtest2[i][j]                             y2  .314f                   System.out.println      codepre

I am exploring the development of an iOS app that uses some custom toolbar shapes and some custom UI elements like the collection popup in iBooks etc.p  pI am wondering what is the best way to implement this so that I am light on resources.p  pOne of the options is to add subviews with a background image and transparent areas to create notchesarrows as seen in the iBooks collection popup.p  pThe other option, from WWDC 2011 video Practical drawing in iOS, where the presenter mention using coregraphics to achieve the same effect using bezier paths etc i think.p  pIs one option betterfastermore practical to implement than the other Creating everything programatically may be faster but it isnt as flexible as, say, drawing something in illustrator.

Negative 6941 pMy HTML5 application uses web workers to analyze an images pixel data from a canvas context. Once the worker has analyzed the data, it makes 3 XHR calls back to my server to update my model. When I was testing the application, I was able to start and run as may workers as I tried, and each worker only made one XHR call back to the server. Everything worked fine.p  pNow that I attempt to make three async calls from a single worker, I get problems. Looking at Chromes developer tools, I can see that all 3 calls get fired, but they all get cancelled, except for the last one. This happens if I make any or all of the calls async or not. However, if I use a timer setTimeout to fire each call about 500 milliseconds apart from each other, they all work fine.p  pAny ideasp  pIn short, my questions arep  pstrong1.strong  How many ajax calls can be make at the same time inside a workerp  pstrong2.strong  emWhy did ajax calls get cancelled inside my workerem strongsolvedstrongp  pstrong3.strong  Slightly unrelated to my problem at hand, but what is the max number of workers you can start in a single page Should I stop a worker once I know I wont be sending it any messagesp  pThanksp  pstrongUpdatestrong Turns out I solved the problem I was having with async calls getting canceled. The problem was that I had created my own simple ajax class to use inside the worker, and instead of instantiating it for each call, I was using the same instance of this object. So when I made subsequent calls through it after an earlier call had been made, the first call would get cancelled if it hadnt returned before the new call was made. Hope that makes sense.p

I want to be able to change the values of the form later, and doing so by going back to the form, thats filled with the values entered in the data base.p  pEverything seems to be working, except for the drop down menu. As I want all fields to be filled with the correct values, this goes for the menu as well. So, I tried using string comparison in ifelse clauses to determine which option to set as selected.

Negative 6941 pIve been wondering about the ideal document structure for maximum query efficiency for various situations and theres one I want to ask about. Its really borne out of me not really knowing how MongoDB behaves in memory in this specific kind of case. Let me give you a hypothetical scenario.p  pImagine a Twitterstyle system of Followers and Followees. After an admittedly cursory glance, the main options appear to bep  ol lipIn each user document, a followers array containing references to all the documents of other users they follow. Followees are found by finding our current user in other users user.followers array. The main downside would appear to be the potential query overhead of the Followee search. Also, for a query specifically for the contents of user.followers, does MongoDB just access the required field in users documents, or is the whole user document found and then the required field values looked up from there and is this cachedstored in such a way that a query over a large user base would require significantly more memorypli lipIn each user document, storing both followers and followees for quicker access to each. This obviously has the downside of duplicate data in the sense that an entry for user A following user B exists in both user documents in the respective field, and deletion from from requires a matching deletion in the other. Technically, this could be considering doubling number of points of potential failure for a simple deletion. And does MongoDB still suffer from what Ive heard described as swiss cheesing of its memorystored data when deletions occur, and so removals from the 2 fields rather than 1 doubles the effect of that memory hole problempli lipA separate collection for storing users Followers, queried in a similar fashion to the user documents in 1 except that obviously the only data being accessed is Followers so if the user documents contain quite a lot of other data relevant to each user, we avoid accessing that data. This seems to have something of a relational database feel to it though and while I know thats not always a terrible approach just on principle, obviously if one of the other approaches mentioned or one I havent considered is better under Mongos architecture Id love to learnpli ol  pIf anyone has any thoughts on this, or wants to tell me Ive missed a very relevant and and obvious docs page somewhere, or even wants to tell me that Im just being stupid thought with an explanation of why, please   Id love to hear from youp

Negative 6941 pI will try to use gnugettext for localization of a semibig software project, so now Im trying to learn the basics. Problem is that I got stuck on a pretty fundamental function.

Negative 6941 pI am using a UICollectionView programmatically.p  pIve set its frame as followsp  precodeUICollectionView collectionView  [[UICollectionView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 100, self.view.frame.size.width, 3000 collectionViewLayoutflowLayout] codepre  pMy codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutcode has a section inset set asp  precodeflowLayout.sectionInset  UIEdgeInsetsMake20.0, 20.0, 100.0, 20.0 codepre  pI also only have 1 section.p  pIve set the height to be 3,000 to see if the collection view would scroll but it doesnt. I am setting it to that since the collection view doesnt seem to scroll up or down when I insert new items.p  pcodeUICollectionViewcode is subclassed from a codeUIScrollViewcode, which means I can keep resetting the scroll view content size. Would this work properlyp  pThe only issue is that this would work if I know the sizes of all items including how many items are on each row.p  pIf each item had a different size, how would I find out the size of each row I would need that to add all row sizes and increase the content size height of codeself.collectionViewcode.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pEven my suggestion above, resetting the content size, does not work properly I tried the following when updating my collection viewp  precode int numberOfRows  self.dataArray.count  3 self.collectionView.contentSize  CGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, numberOfRows  200  300 codepre  pThis is very ugly though. This is because it assumes all my images are of size 200x200px, which fits 3 images per row hence the division by 3. p  pFurthermore, even with the 300 that I have, the last row I can only see about 34 of it and not all of it. I have to scroll more and I will be able to see it but it goes back up again to 34. Its kind of like the scroll to refresh, where the view only moves if you drag it and when you leave it bumps back to where it was. Why is this happening Is it just that Apple designed codeUICollectionViewcode so poorly This is a little ridiculous... UITableViews adjust their scroll according to their content automatically.p

Negative 6941 pI recently set out on an expedition to unittest a rather complex T4 class. Ive arrived at a major breakthough, but Im afraid the observed behavior may only be coincidentalie, may break in future versions of Visual Studiop  pI basically have something like thisp  pMainTemplate.ttp  precodelt include filegenerator.tt.cs gt codepre  pAnd then in generator.tt.cs I havep  precodelt class code  ....  gt codepre  pThe observed behavior of this is that I can both use the declared classes and such from the T4 template AND compile the code file as normal. However, is prefixing a comment before the codeltcode and codegtcode tags at all defined behavior Do I risk this breaking in the futurep  pAlso, Ive tested this on both MonoDevelop and Visual Studio 2012. It appears to work for both. Visual Studio 2008 compatibility isnt important for me though. p
Negative 6941 pI am writing a program that implements the quicksort, insertion sort, and merge sort. I can get all working except the merge sort and I can not figure out why. Please ignore the operation and comparison variables. They are so I can analyze the runtime and number of operations for different input files. This code is run from the main through a class object in this fashionp  precodeMerge testobj13testMed[0], 100     testobj13.merCall     testobj13.display codepre  pFor a sorted list the class keeps the list sorted, for a reversed list the list still pretty much stays reversed except for the first and last values, for a randomized list I cannot see any pattern between the output and the original input. I will be attempting to answer other questions while I wait for an answer. Any criticism is welcome even if it is just about my code or syntax not relating to the overall issue here.

Negative 6941 pMy Android app is using an SQLite FTS3 table to provide full text search.

Negative 6941 pI have created a web application where i want users to register Login , log out, etc.p  pFor now, I have created a custom CreateUserWizard, that guide the user through the registration process. p  pMy web application contains several aspx pages , as Login , Register, ,Services and the Default.p  pWhen the user visits the site, he is presented with the Default.aspx page where there he sees an horizontal navigation bar with three links Home takes again to the Default.aspx, Servicestakes to the Services.aspx page where the user see his services and  the Login In link ASP Login control that takes the user to the Login Page.p  pThe content of the Default.aspx page that the users see the first time he visits the page, is again a registration form.p  pNow, i can register succesfully a new user, and his credentials are stored in the Membership database, and also i can log in a registerd user. p  pAfter the user is successfully logged in, he is directed to the Services.aspx page.p  pstrongThe problem is that when he gets to the Services.aspx page after logging in, and click on a link in the horizontal navigation bar, the user is automatically logged out.strongp  pstrongn the Web.config file in the emauthenticationem tag, in the emformsem section I have set it to not use cookies, but instead use emcookilessUseUriem .strong p  pstrongI did this because if i use cookies, when the user logs in, then the LoginView control doesnt display the LoggedinTemplate, that is  name of the user that logged in, and keeps showing the message of AnonymousTemplate.strong p  pI dont understand why is this happening, but i am guessing that it has to do something with the not using cookies fact.

Negative 6941 pI have a project that I was originally using codeXMLcode as the data source. Im now refactoring the code to use a SQLite codeSystem.Data.SQLitecode data source. I have found numerous examples that show how to generate SQL queries, but I would prefer to use LINQ, because Im more familiar with that approach. p  pI was originally using LINQpad, with LINQ expressions, to test my LINQ to Objects queries. Within LINQpad I created a connection to my database as well as a basic model information. Then I queried the db like thisp  precodevar site  from s in siteinfo             where s.sitename  some name             select new Site                            ID  s.id,               State  s.state,               City  s.city,               ...                          codepre  pThe LINQpad queries recognize the tables and columns within my database and I am able to generate my desired Objects.p  pMoving to VS 2010 Express I added the codeSystem.Data.SQLitecode and codeSystem.Data.SQLite.Linqcode references. Then I added a connection to my db within the data sources pane, which includes a codeconnectionStringcode in the codeapp.configcode file.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Should this connection should be added to my project as a Dataset my current approach or a Entity Data Model I have tried both, but neither answer the question below.p  pWhen I try to recreate the LINQpad query from above, using VS, intellisense doesnt give me an option to select specific tables. Instead I have the option for codesitedata.siteinfoDataTablecode and similar options for the other tables. For examplep  precodevar site  from s in sitedataset.siteinfoDataTable             where s.sitename  some name             select new Site                            ID  s.id,               State  s.state,               City  s.city,               ...                          codepre  pI get the following error on the codesitedataset.siteinfoDataTablecode referencep  pcodeCould not find an implementation of the query pattern for source type sitedataset.siteinfoDataTable. Where not found.  Are you missing a reference to System.Core.dll or a using directive for System.Linqcodep  pMy project does reference the codeCore.dllcode and I have a codeusingcode directive for codeSystem.Linqcode.p  pI also tried to query the distinct states from the dataset. For examplep  precodevar states  from s in sitedataset.siteinfoDataTable               select s.state.Distinct codepre  pThe codeselectcode statement produces the following errorp  pcodeCannot convert lambda expression to type string because it is not a delegate typecodep  pstrongQuestionstrong Using VS, how do I write a LINQ query against a SQLite database How is that database schema recognized within VSp  pAny help is appreciated, thanksp

Negative 6941 pWe are a team of 60 developers working on the same product and are moving from SVN to Github. We have a process in SVN where in individual files are locked and whenever a developer wants to commit code, he needs to get it unlocked by the owner of the file. Three of us are the owners of the total 150 files. The unlocking is preceded by a code review. p  pIn Github, we are planning to use the ForkClone model  each project a group of dev is working on will do a fork, each developer will do a clone of the fork, write the code amp commit to origin, the lead of the feature will do a pull request to upstream.p  pThough this seems fine, the problem is when a big project gets delivered, it brings in lots of changes for review and hence, increases the load for the file owners. Also, this might happen in the later cycles of development and hence the project might be jeopardized.p  pOne method we thought might work is to have hooks when the git push is done to the origin fork. There can be one final review git pull to upstream. p  pHowever, we could not find any github extensions or push hooks for the same. Is there a quick way read, existing extension to do this with Github or should we use the same hooks that we would use with gitp
Negative 6941 pIn my application I use jquery ajax to fetch the device data at 1 second interval. The device has wince os and the web pages are hosted by httpd web server. We could observe the issue after running the device 2 or more days with web clients connected. The IE status bar displays an error jqXHR is null or not an object or jqXHRis undefined in jquery1.5.2.js, line no. 6819. I am also catching the request errors by using the jquery error function. But this error reported by IE couldnt be captured by the error function p  pLine no. 6819 refers to the jquery setTimeout handler, where the ajax jqXHR object is found invalid. I analysed the issue using fiddler and couldnt find any entry with error. But due to the error occurred in browser, there is no further request sent. What I would assume is the request is blocked in IE and it didnt hit the server, hence we couldnt see the entry in fiddler. Once the timeout value set in ajax request is elapsed, the setTimeout handle is executed. p  pCan anybody guess how the jqXHR object becomes undefined This object is not clearedintialized in any part of the application code. And the requests are sent serially one at a time, after the previous request is complete.

Negative 6941 pIm currently developing an iPad application that is using ZBarSDK for reading QR Codes. p  pI am using codeZBarReaderViewcode  NOT codeUIViewControllercode, so im showing the front facing camera in a codeUIViewcode that is drawn using codeCGRectcode see code below.p  pMy problem is that the camera comes up on its side within the view. The iPad app will ONLY be developed to work in Landscape mode.p  pWhen the codeUIViewcode comes up now, the image is on its side and im not sure how to fix it. I tried using codeCGAffineTransformcode which successfully changes the angle somewhat but how will this handle if the iPad is flipped the other wayp  pI saw some other posts about this similar issue but no resolution that has worked for me. Worth noting im using IOS6 and please remember im using codeZBarReaderViewcode, so the codesupportedOrientationsMaskcode is NOT available. p  pI want the user to see the camera view in the upright position regardless of whether landscape is left or right. Right now though, regardless of which way it is turned, the video is sideways so I can see myself at 90 degrees to the side. The codeUIViewcode doesnt change at all when the screen is turned either.

Negative 6941 pI am trying to get the value of a field that is populated based on a parameter and use it to calculate a sum. I believe the way to do this is to use a custom summary. I noticed devexpress has GetCurrentRow and GetCurrentColumn methods but I do not see a method that will just take the value of that field in my case xrTableCell43 and allow you to use it in calculations. For examplep  pI have a report section that looks like thisp  p2001  2 br 2002  4 br 2003  3 br 2004  1 br 2005  4 brp  hr  pRem 6 br Tot 20p  pHowever I have put a parameter in my report which allows the user to select a year to drill through to. So if they click on 2002 the report will look like thisp  pQ1  1 br Q2  1 br Q3  0 br Q4  2 br 2002  4p  hr  pRem 6 br Tot 20p  pThis all works perfectly. It is the Rem field that I am trying to fix. In this case, the Rem field should be 14 because it should subtract 2002 and previous years from the total. xrTableCell43 has the sum of the year clicked and all previous years. How do I write Tot  value of xrTableCell43 in code so that this result is shown in xrTableCell13p

This is strange because when I restart the server, sometimes the app works fine  SOAP response received and results are shown, but strongonlystrong after I restart the server.  This hints to the fact that saaj classes are somehow found when server is restarted  But, the problem is it must work when I hot deploy or place updated WAR into webapps directory without restarting.  We cannot afford restarting production server each time WAR is updated.p  pAnother weird issue, is after I restart server, launch this WAR app it works fine.  However, other apps which use the same saaj class library throw this same exception  So its either using this WAR app and others not working, or use other apps and this WAR app throws this exception.  Is there some kind of limited saaj library sharing  I have never seen something like this before.p  pPlease, could somebody help me with this very strange and nasty problemp  pThank you, Victor.p

The filter is handy for bailing midway if something goes wrong.p  pYou can play around with changing the process limit from 64 to 1 to see the results arrive serially, or commenting out the key  128 line to prevent stopping.  If you dont set a process number limit, it opens as many file handles to the processes as it can and waits for more to become available internally.p  pThe way it works is, its almost identical to shellexec but launches the process in the background and continues execution.  It pipes any warnings about broken pipes to null, in case you shut down the processes prematurely by closing the handles.p  pstrongMy problem is, I need to make it crossplatform but dont have easy access to a PC or to all of the flavors of Windows like NT.

This really needs to work similarly to the amp in unix, and not generate extra output, block stout or force it to only be accessible through a file, force the user to create a batch file or other weirdness.

Im constantly needing to speed up large tasks that should be trivially easy to parallelize, but php makes it difficult because their hands are tied due to a bunch of OSspecific minutia.p  pSo I think whoever comes up with a solid crossplatform version of this function, or something very similar to a goroutine that just works, would find that their code is quite popular.

These result in build breaks, but they are only detected by TravisCI emafterem the erroneous commit.

Negative 6941 pFor our custom CMS we have extracted everything out to different modules, this includes everything from the user system, the roles manager, the page editor, the theme system etc.p  pSeveral of these are required for the system to run in the first place.p  pSo our composer.json already has about 15 different requirements in place.p  pNow, what I am wondering is, would it be a better idea to create an umberella package, this package would not contain anything itself, but it would require all the different bits and pieces.p  pSo, instead of having 15 different require we could just havep  precode     require          cmscore 1.0.       codepre  pThe downside I see if that for every update to any package under the umbrella we must update the version for the umbrella package, meaning that while the highest part in the framework might only be 2.7.34 the umbrella could well be at 26.12.116 or similar.p  pIf we did create an umbrella package how should we manage this just have the package require all packages as codecode would we run into compatibility issues doing thisp

Negative 6941 pI am not sure if anyone else have faced this issue.  I have an list of array elements which need to display on auto suggest. I biggest issue is I need to display all the categories based on matching string inside the category name. p  pFor example  If I type auto in search box it should display matching records on auto suggest like p  pIndus  bAutobmation  Contribution br Construction  bAutobmation  Industry br Indus  Esbautobmation  TNB br Cal  TheadbautobTextile p  pIt should be order based on the matching alphabets.

Negative 6941 pim having a bit of a brain melting problem. I have a master div thats pretty much the body dont ask me why, i was getting desperate, and within that div is a head div, and within that div is the navigation bar. Its a clear hierarchy. The problem is, whenever i try to use percents to adjust the height and width of the navigation bar or the head div, nothing happens. Zip, zero, nada. Ive tried changing the positions to absolute, relative, even static. Ive removed the Master Div, ive reordered the hierarchy, but nothing seems to work. Eventually i got to the point where i figured out that when i used pixels, i got the change  wanted. Obviously had to do a bit of conversion. My first thought was hierarchy, but again, its clear, with no missing ending tags, no weird parents or children.

Negative 6941 pGood day,p  pMy XSLT transforms XLM pages into HTML pages. Now I am stuck with a problem, that seems not trivial to me. I would appreciate a pointer into the right direction.p  pI want to reduce the number of lines I have to write in my original XML files. What I want, is something like a XSLT preprocessor, translating some XML tags into a group of other XML tags, before XSLT processes them. If at all possible, I want to keep the replaced as well as the replacing lines in the same XML document so, no includefilestyle solutions.p  pExamplep  pOftentimes, my XML files contain repetitive multiple lines, e.g. the following simplified snippetp  precodeltimggt         lturlgtamidi.jpglturlgt ltimggt ltimggt         lturlgtbmidi.jpglturlgt ltimggt ltimggt         lturlgtcmidi.jpglturlgt ltimggt codepre  pIt would be great, if I could include these multiple lines into a macro tag, placed somewhere near the beginning of the XML file, like thisp  precodeltmacro idnameagt         ltimggt                 lturlgtamidi.jpglturlgt         ltimggt         ltimggt                 lturlgtbmidi.jpglturlgt         ltimggt         ltimggt                 lturlgtcmidi.jpglturlgt         ltimggt ltmacrogt codepre  pInstead of repeating the initial lines over and over again at various places, Id just use something likep  precode ltusemacro idnameagt codepre  pNow, I certainly can instruct the XSLT to process the template emmacroem matching the name namea, when it encounters the usemacro tag.p  pHowever, this is not what I want. The reason is, that above emimgem tags are themselves contained in another surrounding tag, say multiimg. The XSLT processing this  tag considers a lot of other tags contained in itself, which dictate how exactly the XML is transformed into HTML and sometimes the emimgem tags even need to be processed multiple times in different manners.p  pHence, what I am looking for, is a way top  p1 first transform the XML usemacro into the XML contained in the emmacroem tagp  p2 and then process the resulting XML with XSLT as if there was no usemacro tag at all in the first place.p  pPossibly the solution is obvious and I am just overworked, but I cant find what I need even not after spending some time with Jeni Tennisons XSLT and XPath  On the edge.p  pI appreciate pointers also to the appropriate chapter in Tennisons book, or just the statement it can not be done. Thanks in advance.p  pRegards, Herbp

Negative 6941 pHi i have been working with tcl scripting for almost a year and now understand almost basics of it completely. But today i just came across nested procedures which is kind of strange as i did not get the use of it. p  pAnyways, i read about nested proc a hrefhttpwiki.tcl.tk997 relnofollowherea but did not get the clear idea as of why do we need it. p  pThe article says that since procs are global in a namespace so to create a local proc you make nested procs. p  precode    proc parent           proc child               puts Inside child proc                  ...         codepre  pNow one usage i can think of is like p  precode    proc parent           proc child intVal              puts intVal is intVal                  puts [child 10]         ... some processing         puts [child 20]         ... some processing         puts [child 30]         ... some processing         puts [child 40]         ... some processing         puts [child 50]         ... some processing      codepre  pSo now the child proc is local to the parent proc and could be used only inside parent proc. And also as i understand it is useful when you want to do same processing at multiple places inside that parent proc. p  pNow my confusion is that Is this the only use of nested proc or is there anything else that i did not understand. I mean the nested proc just seems like a kind of private proc. p  pSo please shed some light on it and help me understand the use of nested procs. p

Negative 6941 pDiv highlighting questionp  pI have 2 divs stacked on top of each other inside a container.

I want a mouseover on the bottom to cause this behavior, but I want a mouseover on the top to do nothing.

Negative 6941 pI used to extend the Db connection class in every class that needs to connect to the database. I think that this is the most common way. But, by following this way, you open and close a new connection in every class instance that extends the db connection class. Lately, i thought that i could create a pdo object and pass it into class constructor. So, every class instance that needs access to database use the same connection. It works but i am not sure if this is an efficient way to do it. Also, i have a function called closeCon that i call at the end of the script so as to close the connection via null and unset.

I mention that the problem persists if I run the code from within ipython, or change interpreteripython to the one from the Enthought distribution, or if I downgrade Cython from 1.9.1 to 1.6.p  pstrongMemory leakage in C strongp  pSince this could look like a memory leak please let me know if there are other possible explanations in the C code, I ran Valgrind on some C test code of the C class, but it didnt find any problems. I am not 100 sure it is free of problems, because I am on OSX Mountain Lion, and despite having used the latest trunk version of Valgrind, it is known to have problems. I am using a OSX10.8 suppression file, with the one suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12452541valgrindreportsleakedmemoryonosx1081 titlehereherea as a start. Anyway, the C class doesnt use newdeletemallocfree, so it SHOULD be fine.p  pstrongMemory leakage in Cython strongp  pI tried running valgrind on the python code that crashes. I have added a python suppression a hrefhttpsvn.python.orgprojectspythontrunkMiscvalgrindpython.supp relnofollowfilea in addition to the OSX suppression file mentioned above.

One of the fragments is a codeViewPagercode, which in turn has its own fragments as pages.p  pThe navigation is hierarchical like thisp  precode Home  Fragment 1  Subfragment 1.1  Subfragment 1.2  Subfragment 1.3  Fragment 2  Subfragment 2.1  Subfragment 2.2  Subfragment 2.3 codepre  pwhere Fragment is a codeViewPagercode, and Subfragments are its pages. All works correctly when I just go to codeFragmentcode from the drawer, strongbut I dont know how to switch directly to a codeViewPagerscode given page nested fragmentstrong.p  pMainActivity with handling nav drawer clicksp  precodeOverride protected void onNavItemSelectedint id      switch intid          case 1             getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction             .replaceR.id.contentframe, new MainFragment             .addToBackStacknull.commit              break         case 100             getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction             .replaceR.id.contentframe, new Fragment1             .addToBackStacknull.commit             break         case 200             getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction             .replaceR.id.contentframe, new Fragment2             .addToBackStacknull.commit             break         .         .         .           codepre  pI suppose this should be something with codegetChildFragmentManagercode and codeViewPagerscode codesetCurrentItemcode, but I cant get the first in my Main Activity or dont know how and I cant use the second because the pager is not created yet if I do something like thisp  precodeSubFragment11 a  new SubFragment11 getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction.replaceR.id.contentframe, a.addToBackStacknull.commit a.setCurrentPagerItem2 codepre

Negative 6941 pstrongBackgroundstrong git  or any other SCM  can successfully merge Storyboards, xibs, and pbxproj files as at their core they are just xml. Sometimes there are conflicts which can be resolved by the usual conflict resolution strategies. But xibs and Storyboards are serialized formats of some pretty complex data structures, so the fun begins.p  pJust as with other source code, a successful merge doesnt guarantee all the merged changes work correctly together. With the files in question, git can successfully merge but Xcode sometimes displays a Could not read archive error when you try to open it  i.e., the merge corrupted the xib.p  pIve seen suggestions about having git ignore .xibs not practical, or in .gitattributes disable diff by settingp  precode.xib crlf diff codepre  pTechnically, that fixes the merge conflictcorrupted xib problem  but now somebodys changes are lost p  pSimilarly, the best recommendation Ive seen for the project file is mergeunion in .gitattributesp  precode.pbxproj mergeunion codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong Ive searched quite a bit and there doesnt seem to be a good solution.

Negative 6941 pIm writing a library, and in it I have a class BaseClass.  Anyone using the library will be creating their own classes that inherit from BaseClass.  I have another class, lets call it Manager, which holds a vector of BaseClass pointers, which can hold any object derived from BaseClass.p  pThe Manager class MUST handle the creation and destruction of any object added to its BaseClass vector.  This is because any object in the vector can be deleted at any time, and the Manager itself can also be deleted.  Because of this, the user of the library cannot add an object to the Managers baseClass vector by passing it a pointer to an already existing object derived from BaseClass.  Well actually, I could allow the user to do that.  But that would involve copying a dummy object, which Id rather not do.p  pTo solve this, Im trying to use a template function.  The user should pass the type of the object derived from BaseClass when trying to add it to the Managers vector.  This is what I currently have.p  precodeManager.h include ltvectorgt include BaseClass.h include lttypeinfogt  class Manager      Vector holding pointers to any objects inherited from BaseClass     vectorltBaseClassgt baseClasses      Template function that needs to add NEW object to baseClass vector     This Im having problems with     templateltclass Tgt     BaseClass Add          BaseClass baseClass  new T         baseClasses.pushbackbaseClass         return baseClass           Template function that gets object from baseClass vector     This works fine     templateltclass Tgt     BaseClass Get          for int i  0 i lt baseClasses.size i              if typeidbaseClasses[i]  typeidT                  return baseClasses[i]                               return NULL       codepre  pFor example, the user should do this when adding to or getting an object from the Managers baseClass vector.

Negative 6941 pAt the heart of an indexing structure, I find myself wondering if an optimization could be made for the following problem p  pI have a big several GB of RAM array of small structuresin RAM, I have a smaller array of indices in the order of 10e4 elements.

I have tried adding port 3306 to my firewall as suggested by a blogger, but that still doesnt work. There are some answers that say in order to connect to amazon rds, the user would need to add hisher IP address to the DB Security Group in amazon rds.  So, does that mean my partner would need to add MY IP address to DB Security Group in the amazon rds account that my partner had created for the database  I been working on getting the connection for the last 6 hours, so Im very greatful if someone could answer my question or point me in the right direction.

Negative 6941 pIn an Angular.js application, I am embedding the a hrefhttpace.c9.ionavabout relnofollowAce editora into a div which I size programmatically by setting its codewidthcode.p  pThis works in Internet Explorer and Firefox, but shows a strange behavior in Chrome After initializing, in most cases, the editor is too tallp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBGb91.png altscreenshot from Chrome developer toolsp  pThe codeacetexteditorcodecodedivcode has height code326pxcode, although the surrounding codedivcodes only have height code262pxcode.

Negative 6941 pI need to scrub an SQL Server table on a regular basis, but my solution is taking ridiculously long about 12 minutes for 73,000 records.p  pMy table has 4 fields id1 id2 val1 val2p  pFor every group of records with the same id1, I need to keep the first lowest id2 and last highest id2 and delete everything in between UNLESS val1 or val2 has changed from the previous next lowest id2 record. p  pIf youre following me so far, what would a more efficient algorithm be Here is my java codep  precodeboolean bDELfalse qps  conn.prepareStatementSELECT id1, id2, val1, val2 from STATUSDATA ORDER BY id1, id2 qrs  qps.executeQuery KEEP FIRST amp LAST, DISCARD EVERYTHING ELSE EXCEPT WHERE CHANGE IN val1 or val2 while qrs.next      thisID1  qrs.getIntid1     thisID2  qrs.getIntid2     thisVAL1 qrs.getIntval1     thisVAL2 qrs.getDoubleval2     if thisID1lastID1               if bDEL              Ensures this is not the last record             qps2  conn2.prepareStatementDELETE FROM STATUSDATA where id1lastID1 and id2lastID2             qps2.executeUpdate             qps2.close             bDEL  false                  if thisVAL1lastVAL1 ampamp thisVAL2lastVAL2              bDEL  true               else if bDEL bDELfalse     lastID1  thisID1     lastID2  thisID2     lastVAL1 thisVAL1     lastVAL2 thisVAL2  codepre  pstrongUPDATE 4202015  1110 AMstrongp  pOK so here is my final solution  for every record, the Java code enters an XML record into a string which is written to file every 10,000 records and then java calls a stored procedure on SQL Server and passes the file name to read. The stored procedure can only use the file name as a variable if dynamic SQL is used to execute the openrowset.

Negative 6941 pSo I have a VBA code that is importing excel sheets into Access as new tables, deleting data out of existing tables and then using the SQL codeINSERTcode function to move the data from the new tables into the existing tables to preserve the relationships that exist. I have 3 tables this is done to and for some reason only one of them isnt working. The code seems to execute with no errors but when I open up the table there is no data. The table being imported has the same column names and the same data types on all fields as the table I am trying to insert into. Does anyone have an idea as to why only the one table is not importing correctly Below is the code I am using, and the Part Number the one that isnt workingp  precodeSQL  INSERT INTO [Reps] SELECT RepsX.

Negative 6941 pI wrote a C program that is supposed to create a certain number of child processes, each child process having to change 1 letter from a string. The string and the number of child processes are read from the keyboard.p  pI want to do it using pipes. It should work like this The parent changes one letter, then the first child takes the string modified by the parent and changes one more letter. The second child takes the string modified by the first one 2 letters are already changed and changes one more and so on. I am new to C and am not quite sure how it all works, especially pipes. p  pAlso can the children be linked between them through the pipe, or can they only be linked to the parent and it has to be something like first child changes a letter, gives the string back to the parent and then the second child reads from there, modifies letter and gives back.  If its like that, is there any way to make sure that this doesnt happen Apples becomes AppleD and then AppleX and then AppleQp  pFor example p  precodeinput  3 Apples    output  Applex Appldx Apqldx codepre  pMy problem is I dont get any output from the children. Unsure what Im doing wrong.

Negative 6941 pSo this is a new one, I am thinking.  We have an Access query with 2 date fields fdate1 and fdate2.  The fdate1 is always the first date, and fdate2 is always the second.  The two are a range.  What we need to do is query the table to find all the records where the record is at any point in the year 2010.  So for instance, here is some pretend datap  pFname fdate1 fdate2br John  2182008 5082014br Mary 162010 6212010br Jane 9252010 4132012brp  pWe need to know any records that involve the date range of 112010  12312010.  As you can see, the above records all match, but because they are 2 separate fields, I am not sure how to find that those 2 columns represent a date range and that date range does or does not overlap with the date range criteria.  Make sensep  pAny help is appreciated.p
Negative 6941 pI am playing with introspection and would like to extract argument count and argument names at runtime. Would it be possible to implement something like thisp  precodeclass Greeter    def self.greetname, weekday  Friday      Hello name. Today is weekday    end     def self.splatterarguments      arguments.join    end end  Greeter.argumentcountgreet gt 1..2  Greeter.argumentnamesgreet gt [name, weekday]  Greeter.argumentcountsplatter gt [0..Infinity] codepre  pI have no idea on how to retrieve the names of the arguments.p  pI have however managed to extract the arguments count by by deliberately invoking the method with a flood of random arguments solely to trigger codeArgumentErrorcode and then extract the permitted number of arguments from the exception message. However, this is dangerous and does not work for splat method signatures.p

Negative 6941 pI work on  an asp.net hybrid webforms  mvc4 application that provides  videos of expert speakers to employees at various organizations.  I currently use  asp.net membership to authenticate users based on the company they work for each company has a login,  set roles to determine what videos they have access to, and build reports etc.  p  pHowever, my company wants to begin adding login for individual users as well.  Rewriting our entire membership system would essentially mean rebuilding a large portion of the site  instead I was thinking of adding another membership provider for  individuals that would map to the membership provider we already have for organizations.  What I am envisioning is a the followingp  p1The user logs on with their username and password using the individual membership frameworkp  p2The application maps the user to the corresponding member in the original company membership framework, and automatically authenticates the user for that membership invisible to the user where it assigns the correct roles etc based on the organizatiom the user belongs to. Essentially this second membership would be almost a layer on top of the original.p  pI was considering building extended tables for individual users in SQL Server that would map to the current company members that we have  however, I would prefer to user another membership provider for the individual users that maps to the original membership provider, as this would save writing all the CRUD code, forgot password and api that comes with a membership framework. Im just wondering whether this is possible, or what the best practice would be in this case.p

Negative 6941 pIm looking for a bit of advice on developing my first Cordova application.p  pI Was planning on using just jquery mobile to develop it and it seems relatively straightforward.

Negative 6941 pIm trying to figure out a way to create an implicit style for a custom control, that will be inherited by other styles applied to the control.p  pFor example, lets say I have a control codeFancyButtoncode.

Negative 6941 pI realize this question comes up a lot, but there is no one solution that has seemed to work for anyone.p  pI am working on developing an app for iOS and recently had to transfer my app to another developer account. My first account was an individual account where I was Agent, and now the new account corporate I think has me listed as Agent.p  pI created the certificates like I have always done, downloaded them, and placed them in my keychain. Everything said it was in order. I then created the app ID and reentered all of the devices into the devices column. I moved on to the provisioning profiles, and again everything worked well. I downloaded them and imported them into Xcode, and when I go under settings and look under the account, it all looks in order.p  pThen when I attempt to build in corona, it tells me Certificate Not Installed. Even though I had created the certificate on that device.p  pA possibility is that having 2 apple dev accounts signed in at once was confusing, so I logged out of my other, and, not surprisingly lost my ability to build for those either. I could still not build for iOS. p  pI have tried restarting my computer several times, and deleting everything and starting from scratch. I have tried creating the certificates a variety of ways and billions of combinations. I even tried using my other computer  although it also had dev set up for my other account.p  pAm I missing something crucial here I dont have another computer to start over on if that is what it takes, but I guess I could clear one... p  pI greatly appreciate any suggestionsp

Negative 6941 pI dont know if someone has faced the same issue, but while the debugging of my app on the new iOS 8, I faced a problem with the Media API of phonegap. In some of my audios which are less than 2 secs, the media api doesnt call the onStatus function, in order to update the status of the MediaPlayer at the end of the file. Instead it throws me an error MediaError.MEDIAERRDECODE, which means that something goes wrong with the file and its decode.

I can display the cameras video on a form then create a transparent form on top of that and use GDI to build my on screen display. The 2 things I would still like to add to my OSD are the current FPS count, and when I pull the trigger on my joystick I would like to capture the screen and save it to disk.p  pSo in order to do this I believe that I need to add a sample grabber filter to time the FPS manually and pull out individual frames. I added a sample grabber to the graph along with an AVI Decompressor and tried to run it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhzQgc.png altFilter Graph 2p  pWith all the trouble I have been having with directshow I didnt expect it to work but surprisingly it did. In GraphEditPlus the video displayed and I could see the samplegrabber capturing the frames. SO I exported it to C and attempted to run it again.p  precodeint hr  0          graph builder         ICaptureGraphBuilder2 pBuilder  ICaptureGraphBuilder2new CaptureGraphBuilder2         hr

Negative 6941 pOkay so I ran into a little problem and Im not entirely sure how to word the question properly so the title may be a little misleading. Also, the code Im having trouble with is a small part of a larger one, so Ill do my best to explain my situation.p  pBasically, this piece of code is in a for loop and what Im trying to make it do is to make a certain variable decrement by a certain number each time the loop runs.p  precodeint column  h  1  if array[i]  1     while d lt column  1           r.lower       d        if d  column  1           r.drop       column 1      codepre  pSorry if it looks a bit cryptic.  Just forget about the emdem  and emrem variables for now and focus on the emcolumnem and emhem.p  pWhat Im trying to make it do is take the value of the height minus one h  1 and store it in the local variable emcolumnem, and then decrement it by 1 column  1so the value will be updated for the next time the loop runs and the IF statement conditions are fulfilled.p  pThe problem here is that the height is a dynamic variable  throughout the rest of the code it is constantly changing and because of that, my code will only work the first time and when it runs a second time, it doesnt seem to decrement at all.p  pSo my question is how can I store the CURRENT value of the height into a local variable, and make it static keeps the same value throughout the loop so that I can successfully decrement itp  pSorry if that was poorly explained and please correct me if I am using any terms wrongly.p  pThanks for your timep

Negative 6941 pTo start off, I just want to say I am a CS Major and my university stronghas strict rules on any sort of plagiarismstrong, so any answer that doesnt say strongtry this codestrong would be greatly appreciated  using code to explain is fine. Anyways, my question. I just reached a point where I am really trying to understand a sharp learning curve for me. Inheritance and Polymorphism. My textbook explains it very well, and I understand the material, its just applying it to something real is what is getting to me. My assignment in a nutshell reads from a text file which contains a fantasy baseball team players, and stats of each player and then outputs a new text file with the teams entire stats. But my confusion is stemming from the following procedures after connecting to the file, which involve passing the scanner onto a class called codeBaseballTeamcode, which is aggregated with a superclass called codePlayercode, which then has two subclasses. Here is my driverp  precodepublic static final String INPUTFILE  baseballTeam.txt   public static void mainString[] args      BaseballTeam team  new BaseballTeam      Scanner inputStream  null     try          inputStream  new Scannernew FileINPUTFILE         team.loadTeaminputStream       catch FileNotFoundException e          System.out.printlnFile   INPUTFILE   Not Found.         System.exit1 codepre  pThe codeBaseballTeamcode class is supposed to create an array of player references as an instance variable, and then the codeloadTeamcode method creates objects for each type of player pitcher, batter, or sub. After that, the scanner is handed of to a method called codeloadDatacode within the codePlayercode class, which is then inherited by the other two classes codeBattercode and codePitchercode with the same method name. Im posting my other classes unfinishedbarely started just in case the structure needs to be referenced.

Negative 6941 pI have a Java web application with two servlets. One servlet is used to create a new user account, the other one is used to edit an existing user account given its unique id.p  pIf servlet 1 is called createuser, it generates a new user account with a unique id and then issues a redirect to servlet 2 edituseruid123. Servlet 2 then loads the data for the given user account.p  pNow the special thing All operations executed by the two servlets are performed in a kind of transaction. The transaction is started and finally committed by a servlet filter pseudo codep  precodepublic void doFilterServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain throws IOException, ServletException      Transaction t  Transaction.startTransaction     try          chain.doFilterrequest, response      finally          t.commit       codepre  pThe user account generated by servlet 1 is not visible to the outside world and therefore servlet 2 until the transaction has been committed.p  pThis works perfect on 100 installations based on various versions of Tomcat, WebSphere and JBoss. But there is one installation based on WebLogic 10.3.5.0 where we get an exception in servlet 2 because it is not able to find the user account. It seems as if the redirect instruction is sent back to the client and that the client sends it to the server BEFORE the original request is postprocessed by the servlet filter. As a result, the new user account has not been committed yet and servlet 2 fails to load its data.p  pI know that a redirect is implemented as Location HTTP response header. I also know that a web server may start to send back data to the client starting with the response header before the complete response has been generated on server side. But is a client allowed to follow the redirect before the original HTTP request has been processed completely Is there no guarantee that the original request has been fully processed including all servlet filters before the redirect takes placep

Negative 6941 pI have been having an issue where one of my methods is executing before my getJSON calls are finished executing.  This method needs the data from the calls before executing itself.p  pI have looked up a few things such as deferred calls or .done, but my main issue is that my nested getJSON calls are variable.  This means from my first file I get a number and with that number I create a loop and then do multiple getJSON calls based on that number.  I cannot attach a .done because I have to do it multiple times, and a deferred call wont work for the same reason.  For some reason the first .done doesnt wait until the inner getJSON calls finish before executing...

Negative 6941 pIm using MvcSiteMapProvider to create a simple breadcrumb. Im having a small problem which I cant solve. Lets assume that my website contains five tabs Home, Customer, Company, Reports and About these are the top level tabsp  pWhen a user is browsing the page Home, I dont want the breadcrumb to show up. However, when the user is on the page Customer,  the Breadcrumb should display Home and the same applies to rest of the top level tabs  except Home of course. And for the next level, assuming the user has clicked on a link called Customer Details on the Customer page, the breadcrumb should display Home  Customer. So basically, the top level is omitted.p  pHow can I archive this Any help is highly appreciated p

Negative 6941 pI have a program Im attempting to transfer over to a server to run with a scheduled task.  Its using PHPExcel to essentially automate a schedule.

That is simply with this codep  precodephp CwampwwwFolderFile.php pause codepre  pNow when I run this as the batch file manually, everything works perfectly and theres no problems.  If I run it through task scheduler whether manually or scheduled, it cant find the first of the parameter tables it needs to open to find pertinent information and ends there with this exception  Fatal error  Uncaught exception PHPExcelReaderException with message Could not open ExcelFile.xlsx for reading File does not exist.p  pSome research has shown similar problems being caused by privileges, excel having problems with automation, the code from the batch file, and having the wrong path.  p  pPrivileges shouldnt be an issue because Im running it from the domain administrator account, though I wonder if since its a virtual machine that was just set up in a hurry perhaps theres something off.  It just doesnt make sense for a userlevel account to have more privileges than system level considering both are admin.p  pIts currently running with libreoffice, which I thought might be the issue except as previously mentioned it runs fine when manually running the batch file.  And that throws the excel issues out.p  pThose other two issues were pretty easy to check, simply because it runs correctly one way, and if they were off it would never run correctly.p  pAre there any ideas why this would be occurring like this and how to fix it  How can it run fine manually on an admin user account, but not automatically as a system level task running with admin level privileges  p  pThank youp

Negative 6941 pA friend and I well a friend w me looking over the code to find any logical inconsistencies are trying to write an IRC bot in Java mostly from scratch that is, not using egg drop or other popular starting points. Its rather easy to detect a successful server join socket.isConnected, but Im trying to figure out a way to detect a successful channel join. Basically, instead of just assuming that the join was successful, I want to be able to read from the server if the nick is moderated or banned or something else which prevents channel joining. Thanksp  pBasically I want to be able to print out Channel  joined if successful or Channel  join failed if the join wasnt successful. Is there anyway to do this Thanksp  pEdit Upon further research, Im now interested in learning how to decipher server message codes, specifically the format in which theyre sent back to the client. Thanksp
Negative 6941 pIm not sure if this question has been asked or not. I have created a DLL in C. My DLL depends on other DLLs. When someone compile their project using my DLL, the other DLLs will get copy to the projectDir.p  pHowever, the other DLLs depend on some text files and some other executable files. The problem is that the text files and executable files dont get copy to the projectDir. Unfortunate, that will cause the project to crash when running.p  pMy question is, how can I load those text files and executable files to the projectDir whenever my DLLs is compiledp  pThanks.p

Because the uint references the same memory as the 4 bytes, if i change one of them, the uint will change too and vice versa.p  pSince there are no real pointers in Java I dont know the best way to port such thing to Java, because i can not reference the memory directly. Is there any solution else than creating a class with getters and setters making fields private  and updating the uintbytes when changing the other values p  pThanks for your input. p

Negative 6941 pI have a project that involves subdirectories with submakefiles. Im aware that I can pass variables from a parent makefile to a submakefile through the environment using the export command. Is there a way to pass variables from a submakefile to its calling makefile I.e. can export work in the reverse Ive attempted this with no success. Im guessing once the submake  finishes its shell is destroyed along with its environment variables. Is there another standard way of passing variables upward p

In JS it is then stripped of its inline properties so that the browser animates it back into position 0px This works as expected on all browsers.p  pHowever on the latest version of iOS the container has random space beneath the element that matches what it once had as a property for transform. e.g. 1000px of padding which only disappears if you remove the transform property from the css altogether i.e. put it in a separate class then remove that class after the animation however you then get a flicker on the screen Which can be fixed by adding the translate3d 0px property  but im left with random spacep  pCant replicate this on desktop or android and I cant find anyone else talking about this issue online.p  pHeres an example a hrefhttptinyurl.compdfndrd relnofollowhttptinyurl.compdfndrdap

Negative 6941 pI want to be able to style my iOS Swiftbased app via config from a json file rather than manually writing UIAppearance logic in code. To do so, however, I effectively need to resolve classfunction name from the strings in the JSON file. But Swift doesnt seem to allow for such mechanism, or at least its not obvious, because if I understand codeSelectorscode correctly, they seem to be doing that alreadyp  precodecloseBarButtonItem  UIBarButtonItem     barButtonSystemItem UIBarButtonSystemItem.Stop,     target self,     action SelectorcloseBarButtonItemClicked codepre  pI understand the reasoning behind disallowing such pattern since its typically unsafe, but in my case I feel that hardcoding hundreds of possible UIElement types and all their corresponding methods into the codetable would actually be a worse pattern  especially for a framework package which may be used in a project built against different version of Xcode with new or missing UIElement objects. I will have to define something along the lines of codeUIButton UIButton.selfcode for every possible UI class and then codesetBackgroundColor func ...  UIObject.appearance.setBackgroundColor... code for each method of each class, which imo is a pretty poor design pattern.p  pTo make this cleaner, Id want something along the lines of a stringeval for class and function names. I understand Swift doesnt allow this for safety reasons, but Im wondering if there is a workaround. In this case Im pretty certain I can prevent crasheserrors with a proper codetrycatchcode block, something along the lines ofp  precodedo      try callMethodOfclassName, method methodName, args argList  catch      let alert  UIAlertView     alert.message  className.methodName entry defines an invalid style or is not stylable  codepre

Negative 6941 pI am working with a legacy system that implements a TPH for a certain number of items. So the current structure looks like thisp  precode Abstract Class 1     Abstract Class 2     Abstract Class 3                                                                                                                                      T1   T2   T3        T4    T5   T6         T7   T8   T9 codepre  pSo Type T is a discriminator across all tables but since certain types share common columns, there are a significant number of different tables. The problem is that all of these items actually share a small commonality but there is no way to gather all of these items into a collection. In reality the hierarchy actually should look more like this. p  precode           Base Abstract 1                                                      Abstract Class 1     Abstract Class 2     Abstract Class 3                                                                                                                                      T1   T2   T3        T4    T5   T6         T7   T8   T9 codepre  pSo essentially what we have is a TPT where each Table per type is a TPH. For a real world example, here is what we need.p  precode            Vehicle                                                               Car                 Boat                 Plane                                                                                                                                     BMW Toyota Fiat      T4   T5   T6         T7    T8   T9 codepre  pObviously there are some design flaws with the initial design and no one anticipated needing to grab a list of all vehicles without querying 3 different tables. So my question is, with the existing structure is there a way add this new hierarchy to entity framework. I was thinking something like thisp  precode  Vehicle      VehicleId   TypeId Boat, Plane, Car, etc   ItemFK BoatID, PlaneId, CarId codepre  pIs this possible Is there a way to map these in entity framework I cant seem to match them correctly. It seems it could possibly work if we were to replace BoatId, PlaneId, and CarId with VehicleId like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12953428conditionalmappinginentityframeworkoroperationwithtphConditional Mapping in Entity Framework  OR operation with TPHa but at that point we would be doing a really invasive schema change which is not really an option and Im not sure that would even work. Essentially I need a way to map existing keys into a new hierarchy. Any help is greatly appreciated. Im at a loss and cant seem to find any solution that answers my question. p
Negative 6941 pIm just getting to grips with Go started two days ago and wrote less than 1000 lines, and Im still wondering about some idioms.p  pI needed to sort a slice of strings by descending length.

Negative 6941 pI would like to have in my program the option to either click on a selection or type a selection. I have coded my program to be able to get the selection using the locator function in conjunction with the plot and text commands, but I would like to be able to let the user type in their selection in the R console using readline. However, since both readline and locator freeze the program until a selection has been made, I cannot think of a way to make it so that once the user has either clicked or typed the program continues. Is this possible and if so how would you do itp

Spring does a lot more yes, its dependency injection mechanism is still not asnice as Guice but undeniably has some great projects that we would like to utilize like Spring Data, Spring Data REST, etc. which eliminate the need for writing a ton of boilerplate code.p

Negative 6941 pI was using random forest and other machine learning techniques to predict a chemical property based on ca 2000 variables which are calculated from the chemical structure this included binary, categorical as well as numerical variables ie a QSPR study. To apply the predictive model to new queries I would like to add a test to see if any new query would fall within the covarage of the used training set of ca 80 000 molecules i.a. that it falls in the applicability domain of the trained model. What would be good approaches to go about with this in R Is there already something prepackaged that I could use for this One apprpach for e.g. is to do a PCA on the training set and test if the query would fall within either the ndimenional convex hull or ndimensional hyperrectangle defined by the minima amp maxima of the n first principal components. Some other possible approaches are outlined a hrefhttpwww.researchgate.netprofileNinaJeliazkovapublication7498882QSARapplicabiltydomainestimationbyprojectionofthetrainingsetdescriptorspaceareviewlinks09e4151028125ac0b6000000.pdf relnofollowherea.

Negative 6941 pwe are implementing a Single Sign On process using WSO2 Identity Server. We have both Microsoft and Java web applications involved and we are facing a problem during the Single LogOut processing with Microsoft based web apps. The issue is related to session invalidation on Identity Provider initiated SLO.p  pThis is the scenariop  ul liWSO2 Identity Server with a single Identity Provider configuredli lian Asp.Net MVC application using ComponentSpace SAML2 assembly and Forms authentication marking controllers with the [Authorize] attribute to ensure that users are authenticated to access them.li lithe DEMO Java Web application provided by WSO2 to test SSOli ul  pThe login process works fine. We get a session ID from WSO2 and the user is authenticated landing on WSO2 login form in the first app, and transparently in the sencond one.p  pIn the Asp.Net webapp, when a successfull login occurs, we authenticate the user to access [Authorize] marked controllers calling FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookieuserName, false . When the user logout from one of the apps, WSO2 sends a SLO request to other partecipants on a configured URI. When this request is reveived by the Microsoft one, we call the FormsAuthentication.SignOut method but the session is not destroyed. If the user refresh the browser page its User.Authenticated property is still True so he can still access [Authorize] marked controllers. This makes sense in my opinion because the caller is WSO2 and not the user browser.p  pWe performed some investigation in the code of the JAR provided by WSO2 for Java applications and it creates a filter on Tomcat implementing a singleton to store WSO2 Session ID relation with Session objects each time a success login operation occurs. When WSO2 request a SLO the filter gets WSO2 Session ID as parameter, accesses the singleton HashTable to retrieve the Session object and calls the Session.Invalidate method of the session object. If the user refreshes the browser, he gets redirected to login page. We tryied to implement something similar on Asp.Net side but even if we get the Session object on server side and call the Session.Abandon method nothing happens when the user refresh the browser. He is still marked as authenticated. p  pI am not very familiar with Cookies and I have the feeling that is something related to them.p  pHad anyone faced a similar issue  Any advice or suggestion will be very appreciated.p  pThanksp
