Positive 1720 pI am going to build an emotion recognition system based on Paul Ekmans emotion model  happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral using STASM and OpenCVs SVM with video clips as the source.p  pHowever, I have no clue about what kind of data that should be fed for the training phase itself. I know that we have to input a codeMatcode type to the SVM, but Im wondering what should be included in the matrix.p  pFor example, suppose we have landmark points that we get from STASM. Each landmark point has its own code[x,y]code coordinate. Furthermore, each face expression has many landmarks points, lets say we cover 17 landmark points. That means after knowing those 17 landmark points for one face expression, we will wrap this data to the first row of the matrix data type and feed it into the SVM and then the process is the same for other expressions we should label them too but lets not focus on that part first.p  pMy questionp  ol listrongIs feeding the x and y coordinates of the landmark points for the system enoughstrong brli ol  pIntuitively I dont think it is enough. We should get some sort of displacement from a neutral expression to a peak expression described in this paper a hrefhttpwww.cs.cmu.edupmichelpublicationsMichelCSTDissertation.pdf relnofollowherea. For example, we can get the Euclidean distance of each landmark point from a neutral state to a happy state and feed the strongdisplacements of the coordinatesstrong to the matrix, instead of the coordinates.p  pBut I feel like there is still something missing with this idea. p  ol start2 listrongIf every expression is compared to the neutral state, then how can the machine know if someones face is in a neutral statestrong brli ol  pI am confused because I dont know to what should the neutral expression comparison be based on since other expressions actually use neutral expression as the comparison. p

When running the script, one core of my CPU is maxed to 100, but the the rest of the cores are untouched, so I am trying to split up the reading into the most threads I can in order to use my CPU to its maximum potential and easily reach 30 FPS.p  pSo is it possible to read webcam frames in parallelp  pThis is my attemptp  precodeimport numpy as np import cv2 import time from threading import Thread   CVCAPPROPFPS  5  cap  cv2.VideoCapture0 fourcc  cv2.VideoWriterfourccMJPG out  cv2.VideoWriteroutput.avi, fourcc, cap.getCVCAPPROPFPS, 640, 480 threads  []  class MyThreadThread     def runself         ret, frame  cap.read  if name  main     try          whilecap.isOpened             thread  MyThread             thread.start             threads.appendthread             time.sleep0.035     except KeyboardInterrupt         for thread in threads             thread.join         cap.release         out.release codepre  pWhen running this script, I get a couple of codeVIDIOCQBUF Invalid argumentcode in my terminal usually 4 times. The greater the sleep value is, the less error messages I get. So for example, if I codetime.sleep0.1code, I might get 23 error messages instead of 4.p  pThis is problematic, because the resulting video file that is generated in the second part of my script that isnt posted here, is corrupted. This error only occurs when reading the webcam feed in parallel. When executing everything sequentially, the video file is good and I can read it with no problems at all.p  pAny insight is greatly appreciated. Cheersp  pstrongEditstrong I think it is also important to note that the codeVIDIOCQBUF Invalid argumentcode error messages happen after reading the first couple frames. For example, I could start my script, which would almost instantaneously trigger those errors, but then my script could run fine for an infinite amount of time without any error messages.p

Negative 1720 pstrongThe question, in briefstrongp  pIn MVC, how do you distinguish between a checkbox click or a selectbox or listbox change from a human meaning Controller, modify the model, and a checkbox click or a selectbox or listbox change from the Controller meaning Im updating the view because the model has changedp  phrp  pstrongThe examplestrongp  pI have a JS app all one big HTMLJS page theres a server behind it, and AJAX going on, but its not important to the example which has the notion of Vertices connected by Edges.  The UI lets you add and remove Vertices on a map, and enable or disable Edges between pairs of Vertices.p  pThere are two ways to disable an Edge from Vertex A to Vertex Bp  ol liclick on the Edge to make the Edge Details window provide you with a Disable This Edge button orli liclick on Vertex A or B to make the Vertex Details window provide you with a checklist of nearby Vertices, from which you can uncheck Vertex B or A.li ol  pHeres how this works under the hood in MVC embut see the end of this post for an update, where I correct problems in my understandingemp  ul liModel a list of Vertex objects and a list of Edge objects.li liView a GMaps UI, with markers and polylines, plus checkboxes and buttons and Vertex Details and Edge Details DIVs.li liController ul liJS functions that update the model when events on the checkboxes and buttons fire andli liJS functions that update the view when events on the models fire.li ulli ul  pstrongHeres the specific inelegancestrongp  ol liThe user has the Vertex Details Window focused on Vertex A, and the Edge Details Window focused on the Edge from Vertex A to Vertex B.li liThe user clicks Disable This Edge in the Edge Details window.li liController function 1 gets the click event, and calls disable on the Edge model object.li liThe Edge model object fires the I just got disabled event.li liController function 2 receives the I just got disabled event, and ol liredraws the Edge Details Window to say Im disabled andli listrongunchecks Vertex B in the Vertex Details Window.strong ol listrongCrapstrong This fires Controller function 1 again, which was listening for UI events that mean an edge was disabledli olli olli ol  pSo theres an unnecessary reupdate of the Model, and reupdate of the View.  In a more complex view with events that fire events that fire events, this can make for dozens of extraneous updatesp  phr strongUpdate a great answer.strongp  pI misunderstood MVC a bit.  I dont have just one View, as I described above I have several Views into several Models.  In particular, I have a checkboxlist View of Edges to a particular Node, and a separate, detailed windowstyle View of an Edge.p  pFurthermore, I shouldnt have one controller function updating all views when the Model changes each View should modify emitselfem when the Model changes.p  pSo if each View registers for state updated events on the Model, and each View updates itself upon receipt of those events, then the answer to my circular events question is simply thisp  pstrongThe checkboxlist View will disable checkbox events for the moment that it is updating the checkboxes after a Model state change.strongp  pNow if a user disables an Edge via the Edge Detail window, the Controller updates the Edge Model, the checkboxlist View receives notification of the update, and the checkboxlist View is smart enough to silence checkbox events while changing the status of the appropriate checkbox.p  pThis is much more palatable than my original solution, where one Controller updates ALL Views  and thus has to know which views need special care and feeding to avoid loops.  Instead, only the single View with troublesome UI elements has to deal with the problem.  p  pThanks to those who answered my questionp

However, there are many wellknown algorithms which are able to do better than this under special circumstances, particularly if one is working with multiple strings.  But sticking such an algorithm into my code would probably add length and complexity, so Id rather use some sort of shortcut based on a built in function.p  pE.g. an input would be a collection of strings, a collection of positive keywords, and a collection of negative keywords.  Output would be a subset of the first collection of keywords, all of which had at least 1 positive keyword but 0 negative keywords.p  pOh, and please dont mention regular expressions as a suggested solutions.p  pIt may be that my requirements are mutually exclusive not much extra code, no external libraries or regex, better than String.Contains, but I thought Id ask.p  pEditp  pA lot of people are only offering silly improvements that wont beat an intelligently used call to contains by much, if anything.  Some people are trying to call Contains more intelligently, which completely misses the point of my question.  So heres an example of a problem to try solving.

I thought about this when I was thinking about Scott Meyers recommendation to prefer nonmember nonfriend functions to member functions. Ive run into decisions where I have a function usually some private member function to help the class do stuff, that could easily be made into a nonmember since it doesnt operate on class privates. p  pHowever, the function is only used by that one class. Of course, the program might evolve to a point where another class may need it, but I find it hard to find a place for these nonmember functions. Its easy when you have a lot of functions with a general purpose, but I find single nonmember functions hard to organize into a specific place, and find that leaving it as a member keeps things clean.

Negative 1720 pIm having an issue using jQuery Tools Tabs AJAX along with jQuery UI Dialog manually doing the AJAX loading for the dialog.  The issue is that the dialog is loaded and setup specifically for the current tab loaded on the tab request via AJAX, along with the tabs content.  jQuery UI, when creating the dialog, removes the container from its original position, adds its markup, and appends it to the body.  p  pThe issue is that the dialog is now outside of the tabs content and will not get replacedremoved on subsequent tab changes.  If the user clicks another tab, or the back button these tabs have an AJAX history using the URL hash, so the page is not actually reloaded, the dialog is broken but doesnt get removed since jQuery UI Dialog moved it outside of the tab content.  It now just shows up at the bottom of the body.  I wrote a hack around for this if the user physically clicks the close button, but this doesnt get fired if the back button is pressed or another tab is loaded via AJAX and jQuery UI actually MOVES IT BACK to the bottom of the body Not sure howwhy it does that.  Any suggestions  And please let me know if I wasnt clear on any of that.

Negative 1720 pIm having a hard time determining the best way to handle this...  With Entity Framework and L2S, LINQ queries return IQueryable.  I have read various opinions on whether the DALBLL should return IQueryable, IEnumerable or IList.  Assuming we go with IList, then the query is run immediately and that control is not passed on to the next layer.  This makes it easier to unit test, etc.  You lose the ability to refine the query at higher levels, but you could simply create another method that allows you to refine the query and still return IList.  And there are many more proscons.  So far so good.p  pNow comes Entity Framework and lazy loading.  I am using POCO objects with proxies in .NET 4VS 2010.  In the presentation layer I dop  precodeforeach Order order in bll.GetOrders    foreach OrderLine orderLine in order.OrderLines         Do something     codepre  pIn this case, GetOrders returns IList so it executes immediately before returning to the PL.  But in the next foreach, you have lazy loading which executes multiple SQL queries as it gets all the OrderLines.  So basically, the PL is running SQL queries on demand in the wrong layer.p  pIs there any sensible way to avoid this  I could turn lazy loading off, but then whats the point of having this feature that everyone was complaining EF1 didnt have  And Ill admit it is very useful in many scenarios.  So I see several optionsp  ol liSomehow remove all associations in the entities and add methods to return them.  This goes against the default EF behaviorcode generation and makes it harder to do some composite multiple entity LINQ queries.  It seems like a step backwards.  I vote no.li liIf we have lazy loading anyway which makes it hard to unit test, then go all the way and return IQueryable.  Youll have more control farther up the layers.  I still dont think this is a good option because IQueryable ties you to L2S, L2E, or your own full implementation of IQueryable.  Lazy loading may run queries on demand, but doesnt tie you to any specific interface.  I vote no.li liTurn off lazy loading.  Youll have to handle your associations manually.  This could be with eager loadings .Include.  I vote yes in some specific cases.li liKeep IList and lazy loading.  I vote yes in many cases, only due to the troubles with the others.li ol  pAny other options or suggestions  I havent found an option that really convinces me.p

Negative 1720 pHow to find out the senders ip address of a udp packet that was received on a device running iOS 3.2 or higherp  pFor example, if using Python on a computer, Id use codeSocketServer.UDPServercode which takes a subclass of codeSocketServer.BaseRequestHandlercode which defines the codehandlecode callback.  When a packet arrives, the callback is called and the senders ip address would be in codeself.clientaddresscode, where codeselfcode is the codeSocketServer.BaseRequestHandlercode instance.p  pUnfortunately, I dont know how to extract this information or gain access to the associated ip header when programming in Objective C and using the frameworks provided for iOS.p  pRight now the only solution I have is to explicitly write the senders ip on the body of the udp packet, but Id rather not rely on the sender putting that information there if I dont have to.p

Negative 1720 pI have a Java application with server and Swing client. Now I need to localize the user interface and possibly also some of the data needs to be locale specific. There are few things in specific I would like to hear your opinions on.p  ol liHow should I distribute the localized strings for the UI into properties files In my application there are several views and each has several panels. Should I have one localization file per language for each panel or view or should I keep all translations for one language in the same file Im currently leaning towards one file per view and language, but Im not sure how I should handle some domain specific terms which appear in many places. Having the same translation on several files does not sound too good.li liThe server throws some exceptions that contain a message that should be displayed to the user. I could get the selected locale from the session and handle the localization at the server, but I feel it would be more elegant to keep all localization files at the client. I have been thinking about sending only a localization key from the server with some kind of placeholders for error specific information, which would be sent with the exception. Then the client could construct the message based on the localization key and replace the placeholders with the error specific information. Does that sound like a good way to handle it, or are there other options Typically my exception messages contain some additional information that changes for each case. It could be for example emA user with username Khilon already existsem, in which case the string in the properties file would be something like emA user with username 0 already existsem.li liThe localization of the data is the area that is the most unclear to me. As Im not sure if it will be ever required, I have so far not planned it very much. The database part sounds straightforward enough, you basically just need an additional table for the strings and a column to tell for which locale the string is. Though Im not sure if it would be best to have a localization table for each data table eg Product and Productnames, or could I use one table for localization strings for all the data tables. The really tricky part is how to handle the UI, as to some degree it would be required for an user to enter text for an object in multiple languages. In practice this could mean for example, that a worker in Finland would give the object a name in Finnish and English, and then a worker in another country could translate it to her own language. If any of you has done something similar, Id be happy to hear how you did it.li ol  pIm very grateful to everybody who can share their experiences with me.p  pP.S. If you happen to know any exceptionally good websites or books on the subject, I would be happy to hear of them. I have of course done some googling and read some articles about localization, but nothing mind blowing yet.p

It works great, and it fetches the document and score it based on thep  blockquote   pthe idea behind the VSM is the more   times a query term appears in a   document relative to the number of   times the term appears in all the   documents in the collection, the more   relevant that document is to the   query.p blockquote  pLucenes Practical Scoring Function is derived from the below.p  precodescoreq,dcoordq,dqueryNormq  tft in d idft2  t.getBoost  normt,d                                     t in q codepre  pin this p  ul listrongtft in dstrong correlates to the terms frequency, defined as the number of times term t appears in the currently scored document d. Documents that have more occurrences of a given term receive a higher scoreli listrongidftstrong stands for Inverse Document Frequency. This value correlates to the inverse of docFreq  the number of documents in which the term t appears. This means rarer terms give higher contribution to the total score.li ul  pThis is very great indeed in most of the situation, but due to the fieldnorm calculation the  result is not accuratep  pstrongfieldnorm  aka field length norm value represents the length of that field in that doc so shorter fields are automatically boosted up.strong p  pDue to this we didnt get the accurate results.

Negative 1720 pIm trying to write a search and replace regex that will detect whether HTML that has been returned by a web request is complete. I have had cases when the server returns incomplete HTML half of the page, so I want to detect that in the client and request the page again. p  pI was thinking the regex could look for the presence of codelthtml[gt]gtcode, and then the absence of codelthtmlgtcode. The replace part would then replace the whole HTML with a bit of special text.p  pI cant just check for the absence of codelthtmlgtcode because the returned data might be a text file, and I cant check MIME types.p  pAny ideas I just cant wrap my head around the lookbehinds this would require. Im not trying to parse HTML, just searching for bits of text, which is what regexes are for, rightp  pEDITp  pThe regexes will be run by C, but I write them in a regex editor. I can only use a search and replace regex to solve this, nothing else.p

This also does NOT workp  precodeExpressionltFuncltDocumentFolder, boolgtgt CanSeeFolder              return c gt c.IsPrivate ampampentities.Persons.WhereCanSeePerson.Containsc.User      codepre  pbut this DOES workp  precodeExpressionltFuncltDocumentFolder, boolgtgt CanSeeFolder                      var canSeePersons  entities.Persons.WhereCanSeePerson             return c gt c.IsPrivate ampamp canSeePersons.Containsc.User          codepre  pp.s. I know I suck  using this stackoverflow formatting thing lolp  hr  pThe reason why this works is because the CanSeePerson function cannot be converted and used in an expression. When you put the canSeePersons variable in the function instead you are placing in an iQueryable type which can be used in an expression. Using var convolutes it a bit.p

Negative 1720 pI am a .NET developer and have been for a while now. I work for an organization that was just recently acquired by a larger company whose primary development language is Java. There are a few .NET developers, but the ratio of .NET to Java has decreased substantially now that the teams have merged.p  pThat being said, Ive decided it would be best for me to start Java development. However, most of the books Ive seen so far for learning Java all take a very basic approach what is a class, OOP principles, etc etc. I am comfortable with this part of development and dont need a primer unless there are differences so profound that someone recommends the fundamentals from a Java perspective.... p  pAnyway, Im looking for a book recommendation for Java development from a software developers perspective that discusses todays techniques. For example, MVC architecture, application best practices I am a web developer, this includes web services, is it worthwhile to work with JSPs or consider Ruby instead, etc etc. p  pA HUGE bonus would be learning through doing. Something like Murachs, where I can step through a project from start to finish, and is light enough on fundamentals that I dont get bored. Im hoping to walk away with enough basic knowledge to volunteer for some internal projects and grow from there.p  pIm sorry if my question is needlessly broad, but Im struggling to find a starting point aside from my Eclipse installation I am doing this on Ubuntu, deliberately avoiding Windows.p  pThanks for any direction or insight you can offer.p  pEDIT  After discussing with a coworker, and reading Berts great suggestion all of them have been excellent, thank you all very much, it turns out the main focus is on EE, and Glassfish. They use NetBeans for development, since it is tightly bound to Glassfish.p  pThis doesnt mean much to me, except that I think the parallel drawn is IISWeb apps to Win32 apps. But perhaps it will help clarify some of the more openended questions in my OP.p

Negative 1720 pthis problem has been doing my head in and I hope you can help Ive found the answers to a number of issues here before and hoping you people can work your magic again p  pOk so part of my app uses the Google Maps API to display an overlay on the map using a custom overlay class as well as the users location using mylocationoverlay. Now if I dont activate the mylocationoverlay everything works fine but if its activated then the app force closes with a codeConcurrentModificationExceptioncode. p  pNow the timer is used to refresh the overlay as its position is always changing. For this I used an async task to remove the overlay and add a new one with the updated position. Am I correct to assume the mylocationoverlay does a similar thing in the background If that assumption is valid then I have come to the conclusion that the mylocationoverlay and my async task are attempting to iteratemodify the same array at the same time. The only this is, I have no idea how to stop this from happeningp  pI cant really post my code here as its very big but I used an example code taken from github created by commonsguy and modified it to produce the same issue. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated as this has been really really frustrating me.

Negative 1720 pIve heard that it is bad design to use instanceof or equivalent a hrefhttpwww.javapractices.comtopicTopicAction.doId31 relnofollowhttpwww.javapractices.comtopicTopicAction.doId31a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3776862whenshouldweuseinstanceofandwhennotwhen should we use instanceof and when nota which I can agree on, mainly because it can make the code hard to reuse. p  pHowever, in some cases Ive found it hard to come up with a good alternative to instanceof. For example, say that I want to make a RealTimeStrategy game. The game consists of obstacles, buildings and tanks, all placed on a grid and each entitity takes up exactly one unit in the grid. So I create the class Entity which is the superclass of the classes Obstacle, Building and Tank. The grid consists of instances of Entity. During each update I want each tank to aim and shoot on an enemy tank within range. So, an easy way to do this would be for each tank to ask the grid for all entities within the tanks range and then iterate over all these entities and check if they are an instance of the class Tank. p  pMy only attempt as an alternative of using instanceof was to use the design pattern a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVisitorpattern relnofollowVisitora. The visitor gets accepted by an entity codeentitygtacceptVisitorvisitorcode which in turn calls one of the methods codevisitorgtvisitObstaclethiscode, codevisitorgtvisitBuildigthiscode or codevisitorgtvisitTankthiscode.  This, however, forced me to create a lot of visitors, almost one new for every single task that I wanted to make on entities. Another problem is that in many cases the visitor calls the same method on the entity, no matter what class it is constructed from. This could for example happen when an entity wants to check if another entity is stationary or not p  h1Python codeh1  precodeclass StationaryEntityGatherVisitor     def initself         self.stationaryEntities  []      def visitObstacleself, obstacle         self.addIfStationary obstacle       def visitBuildigself, building         self.addIfStationary building       def visitTankself, tank         self.addIfStationary tank       def addIfStationaryself, entity         if entity.isStationary             self.stationaryEntities.append entity       def getStationaryEntities         return self.stationaryEntities codepre  pI could, of course, let the entity in this case just ask another entity if it is stationary directly instead of letting a visitor do that. But in that case I would not be consistent on checking properties of entities. To let the method of asking entities about some property directly or through a visitor vary, depending on if I need to check the entities type or not, would, in my opinion, seem like a pretty odd design. p  pSo, do you have any other alternative to using instanceof in the problem described abovep  pThanks Martinp

Negative 1720 pThis should be very trivial.

When I run the above code, I only see return values of 0, 1, or 1 at least for my small set of test cases instead of the actual expected results. Now I do realize that this is because the code doesnt go to my implemented version of strcmp, but instead uses the string.h version of the function, but Im confused as to why this is the case even when I havent included the appropriate header file. p  pAlso, seeing how it does use the header file version, shouldnt I be getting a multiple implementations error or something along those lines when compiling the code p

Negative 1720 pI have the need to create a system to store python data structures on a linux system but have concurrent read and write access to the data from multiple programsdaemonsscripts.  My first thought is I would create a unix socket that would listen for connections and serve up requested data as pickled python data structures.  Any writes by the clients would get synced to disk maybe in batch, though I dont expect it to be high throughput so just Linux vfs caching would likely be fine.  This ensures only a single process reads and writes to the data.p  pThe other idea is to just keep the pickled data structure on disk and only allow a single process access through a lockfile or token... This requires all accessing clients to respect the locking mechanism  use the access module.p  pWhat am I over looking SQLite is available, but Id like to keep this as simple as possible.  p  pWhat would you dop

The mac way is checking for some kind of event like the vsync of the screen to render a new frame. But as you can see, I want to do a lot more than only rendering, I want other threads to do work. Some threads need to be called faster than every 160th of a second. by the way, my thread infrastructure is thread puts event in a synchronized queue, main thread calls processEvents which handles the items in that synchronized queue within the main thread. This is used for network stuff, image loadingprocessing stuff, perlin noise generation, etc... etc...p  pI would love to be able to be able to do this a similar way, but very little information is available about this. I wouldnt mind putting the rendering on a vsync event I will implement this also on windows, but I would like to have a bit more responsiveness on the rest of the code.p  pLook at it this way I would love to be able to process the rest while the GPU is doing stuff anyway, I do not want to wait for a vsync to then start doing stuff that should already have been processed to only then start sending stuff to the GPU. Do you understand what I meanp  pIf I need to look at this from a completely different point of view, please tell me.p  pIf I need to read booksguidestutorialsanything for this, please tell me what to readp  pIm no cocoa developer, Im no objectc programmer, my game engine is entirely in C, but I know my way around xcode enough to make a window appear and show what I draw inside that window. It just doesnt update like my windows version because I dont know how to get it right.p  pUpdate I even believe that I need some kind of loop, even if I want to synchronize on the vertical retrace. The OpenGL programming on MacOSX documentation shows that this is done by setting the SwapInterval. So if I understand correctly, I will always need some kind of loop when rendering real time on the Mac, using the swapInterval setting to lower power usage. Is this truep

Negative 1720 pI am looking for an algorithm that hopefully exists out there, but maybe I havent found the right terms to search for...p  pI have a kind of elastic band in a 3d space, the band is fixed at the start and end point. For every point in space I can calculate an external force acting on the band. Inner forces act like springs force in tangential direction. I am looking for an equlibrium condition between inner contracting forces and outer distracting forces. The problem is that the outer forces are not available in closed form but they are steady.p  pCurrently I have solved the problem by sampling an initial guess of the band with some number of equidistant points, calculating the forces in every sample point, moving the point in the direction of the resulting force and repeating until no substantial movements occur anymore. p  pHowever, I am wondering if there are more efficient solutions to this What might be a good term to search for publications on this topicp  pThanks for any hintsp

Negative 1720 pI have an array of KeyValuePairs like thisp  precodeKeyValuePairltlong,intgt[] orderItems codepre  pThe long component of this KeyValuePair corresponds to an Id primary key value on a database table.p  pUsing the Entity Framework, I have defined a repository which provides the following method on its interfacep  precodeIEnumerableltTgt GetManyExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt where     codepre  pThe above repository method allows me to query the database using lambda expressions. For example, if I want to query the database for all rows where the Category column equals Cameras I can say thisp  precodevar results  repository.GetManya gt a.Category.ContainsCameras.ToList codepre  pWhat I want to query for is all rows where the Id primary key is equal to the Key value from any element of the array of KeyValuePairs. So if the list of KeyValuePairs is a list of product Ids  and their quantities , I just want to query the database for all products whose Id is in my array.p  pCan anyone venture an appropriate lambda expressionp  pememEDIT TO ORIGINALp  pThe suggestion to usep  precodevar results  repository.GetManya gt keys.Anyx gt x  a.Id.ToList  codepre  pis a good one and will work if I first create an array of the keys from the KeyValuePair array. So something like thisp  precodelong[] pids  new long[orderItems.Length]  for int i  0 i lt orderItems.Length i       pids[0]  orderItems[i].Key  var products  productRepository.GetManya gt pids.Anyx gt x  a.Id.ToList     codepre  pThis shows that the Any clause is supported by EF. I still cant get this to work without using the array of longs though. Kudos to anyone clever enough to give a solution that doesnt require me to extract the key value from the KeyValuePair into an array first. p  pIf I use the keys.Any I get the following exceptionp  pUnable to create a constant value of type System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable1. Only primitive types for instance Int32, String and Guid are supported in this contextp

Negative 1720 pIm currently building an Android project that I believe will use quite a lot of RAM, much more than the default max heap size set by devices. p  pThe app will be the only one that runs on our Android machines theyre singlepurpose, so Im not worried about slowing down other processes. I want all the resources possible to go to this one program.p  pI know that I can usep  precodeandroidlargeHeaptrue codepre  pto give myself more room. However, in another post, a commenter suggested that this setting does not override the machinespecific max heap size. Is this true And if so, is there another way to exceed this limitp  pAs an aside, I saw some posts that show how to do this natively. Unfortunately, Im a mere Java programmer and so I have to work within the constraints of Dalvik.p

Negative 1720 pI was planning to develop an ecommerce  website which might take me 8 months12 months I work on this project part time to build the prototype. I havent decided yet if I can do that alone or with a 34 team of colleagues. The website will be owned by me or with 34 other colleagues. I believe if I am going to use the best resources I can find, the website might get hundred thousands of customers in the near future. p  pHowever, I am just an Application developer 3 years of Java experience and I dont know more about Architectural staffs. So, I am seeking an advice how to build this system from the scratch and make it available for customers before 2013.p  pI am also focused on the future challenges I might face. So, instead of building the system quickly which might fail in the future or might cost a lot of effort, time, and money to manage it, I would rather build it in a timely manner, carefully, and by using the entire available source I can afford. p  pBelow are a list of things which you might consider giving me your advice on.    Using FreeSources starting from IDE, to plugins and so onp  p   How much effort, time and money should I budget.p  p   How to build the Architecture so that the system will be more extensible and easy  to manage in the future.p  p   Which languages to use am good  OOP languages like Java, and a little bit of Grails p  p   I also considered the app to be accessible via Mobile phones p  p   Making the system cloud based.p  p   Which Databases either Schema based or Schema less and Servers to consider.p  p   Security issuesp  p   Should I use Test Driven Developmentp  p   How about documentationp  p   What frameworks to use, instead of inventing the wheels from the scratch. Like for security purpose I might consider Shiro framework, and so on.p  p   Use of patterns and algorithms.p  p   In the future if the project went well and needs some more experts, I planned to make it open source.p  p   How to use social networking features.p  p   And any of your comments.p  pbr I would prefer if you are a professional and have an experience with different technologies in the past few years. Even if you tell me your past experience, I will appreciate that.Thank you for your time.p

Negative 1720 pI have a third party control that utilizes a single hidden input field to store a list of integers. This control is used throughout the site on numerous forms.p  pThe submitted value as displayed in Fiddler isp  precodeitems1,35,346,547 codepre  pThe controller action looks likep  precodepublic ActionResults SomeActionIEnumerableltintgt items ... codepre  pAs expected, the DefaultModelBinder fails to parse the list of integers. Given that I do have the ability to change the format of the input value, is there a format that would enable the default model binder to parse this for mep  pI could easily change the action to have a string parameter and handle the parsing myself, however Id like the model binder to do this for me. I could also intercept the form submit and scrapechange the datadatatype to JSON or someother format, however Id really like to avoid this approach. Another option would be to create a custom model binder, but this seems like it might be a bit of overkill.p  pRecommendationsp

Negative 1720 pI just spent a lot of time debugging a dumb mistake, releasing a variable that I hadnt allocated and wondered if theres a way to have XCodes Analyze warn me next time.

Analyze seems to do a good job of reporting when you have too few [release]s, and having too many seems to be just as analyzable.  Is there something that can be turned on that Im missingp

I can get all the data in one query withp  precodedata  dbgtquery     SELECT         tablea.name   as name,         tablea.desc   as desc,         tableb.name   as b.name,         tableb.desc   as b.desc,         tablec.name   as c.name,         tablec.desc   as c.desc,     FROM tablea         LEFT JOIN tableb on tableb.id  tablea.bId         LEFT JOIN tablec on tablec.id  tablea.cId     WHERE tablea.id  id gtfetch  a  new A agtname  data[name] agtdesc  data[desc] agtb  new B agtbgtname  data[b.name] agtbgtdesc  data[b.desc] agtc  new B agtcgtname  data[c.name] agtcgtdesc  data[c.desc] codepre  pThis only gives me an associative array, which means I need to build my objects manually. Additionally, it requires me to list all possible properties in my query.p  pIs there a better way of doing this Or is it perfectly ok to do 3 queries herep

Negative 1720 pHaving asked my last question here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8715328creatingdynamicboxesdivswithdifferenttitlesreturnedbyspCreating dynamic boxes divs with different titles returned by SPap  pI created a repeater control and create few boxes divs. I could successfully create Titles for each boxes. My next big step is to have Checkboxlists in the repeater control. Those checkboxlists are populated by data returned by a stored procedure. I have about 8 boxes but this number vary depend on the data returned by the Stored Procedure. With the code i have now, all the checkboxlist will display the same data. I need to have different checkboxlist for each category. My next step will be to create SelectedIndexChanged Events and refilter all those checkboxlist. The overall design and idea is sort of like Search Filter that we find on shopping carts. I found some say Repeater are just good to display data so may be i have to use something else. I cant brainstorm how this can be achievable. I have to use VB.net. The database is SQL server 2008. Using Linq for datasource is alright. Please give me suggestion how this can be achieveable.

Negative 1720 pI have been reading Effective C and a few other such booksblogs recently and when talking about the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.idisposable.dispose.aspx relnofollowstandard Dispose patterna which Im already using they all recommend using the class emdisposeem variable as defined in that MSDN sample code at the beginning of every method. Essentially to insure that once Dispose has been called, any attempt to use the object would result in ObjectDisposedException. This makes sense, but is an enormous amount of manual labor in a large enough code base and relies on humans remembering to do it. So I am looking for a better way.p  pI recently came across and started using the a hrefhttpcode.google.compnotifypropertyweaver relnofollownotifypropertyweavera that automatically fills out all the boilerplate code of calling the PropertyChanged handlers works as an msbuild task, thus requiring no additional shipping dependency. I wonder if anyone knows of a similar solution for the standard dispose pattern. What it would essentially do is accept a variable name as config the codebool disposedcode in MSDNs sample case, and add the following code to every method that isnt the Finalizer or named Dispose in every class that implements IDisposablep  precodeifdisposed   throw new ObjectDisposedException codepre  pDoes such a thing exist Alternatively what do people do to achieve this in their code, manually add the ifstatementp  pstrongClarification of Purposestrongbr The greater need for this is not some best practice drive, but that we do have users managing the lifecycles of our objects improperly. Right now they just get a NullReference or some other such thing from underlying resource, which could mean we have a bug in our library, I want to communicate to them that they are the ones creating the issue and how they are crating it considering Im in position to know. So suggestions that the users of our Types are the ones who should be taking care of this, isnt really productive here.p

Negative 1720 pwe are maintaining a webshop based on Magento which has payment modules installed from Mindstretch.

Negative 1720 pIm developing an iPhone iOS 5 app using storyboards. The first screen of the app is a splashlogin screen that checks for Facebook credentials and enables you to read and accept Terms And Conditions. In case there are valid stored credentials and the TOC has been previously accepted, this view automatically makes a modal segue using a cross dissolve effect to the first real application view, a tab bar controller with three tabs.p  pIm currently implementing backgrounding and foregrounding logic. The problem is that when pressing the home button and then coming back, the login screen is briefly shown before the correct prebackgrounding view is restored. The Default.png of the app is of the login screen background, so it might be either that or a backgroundingtime screenshot of the actual login screen I havent tested replacing Default.png yet to tell the difference.p  pWhy is this As far as I can tell, backgrounding the app should just take a screenshot of the view that is visible on the screen when, say, hitting the home button, and restore that prior to restoring the actual view functionality when coming back to the foreground. In this case that would be one of the tabs of the tab bar controller. Is the modal segue between the login screen and the tab bar controller the culprit here, or something elsep  pIve always felt that the cross dissolve modal segue from the login screen to the first useful screen is a bit dirty, since IMHO a modal segue seems to imply that what your segueing to is something youll later dismiss to get back to the from screen. What Im doing now is just leaving the target of the modal segue visible indefinitely. If that is the problem here, Id love it if someone would suggest a better method of displaying, transitioning away from and jettisoning the login screen.p

Negative 1720 pIve always heard and believed that stored procedures are the heart of an SQL database and theyre the most optimal objects to use for many purposes. Many people even use stored procedures instead of triggers. In my Delphi application I query a table with 20.000 rows, each row consisting of about 20 columns. When I do this with stored procedure it takes about 3 seconds to load but if I use queries it takes less than a second. This is very important because the table is going to hold more that a million records. I need to choose the best optimal way as Im convinced that it will never be less than 10 seconds when the table is full with that many records. How come a stored procedure takes longer than ad hoc queries.p

Negative 1720 pMy client has an app in the App Store that uses the autorenew subscription type. Upon resubmitting the app it was rejected because they claimed they dont have periodic content even though they do... but this problem seems to be ubiquitous currently. I was wondering what the best approach is to deal with nonrenewing subscriptions. Specifically issues dealing withp  ol liLosing your device and restoring your subscriptionli liRestoring your subscription to multiple devices as mandated by Appleli liPreventing users from abusing the system.li ol  pWhat I came up with so far is the followingp  pWhen a user purchases a 1 month subscription this information is stored locally say in NSUserDefaults. Also, a unique ID is generated and sent to my clients server. When the subscription ends users are asked whether they want to be directed to the purchase screen. If users wishes to save the subscription in case they need to restore they device, or in case they lose their device, they can opt to have the unique identifier sent to their email address which they are prompted to enter, indicating that this information will not be used. The app has an place to enter this ID. It will retrieve the subscription information from the server and again store this in the NSUserDefaults. Each time a restore is done, a counter is increased. When it has reached say 5, the user can no longer restore. The same principle described above works in the case of sharing subscriptions over multiple devices. Does this seem like a reasonable solution and one that Apple will acceptp  pThanks for your timep

It creates the chart that I need, but also creates additional, superfluous charts with only part of the data. It appears that each time emiReportem hits a new group from the query, it creates a new chart with the information with that groups data in addition to any data from previous groups ie. in this case, it created 2 Pie Charts, one which showed only the female members of the DB and one which showed both male and female members. This theory was also tested by adding a new category in the DB M, F, U to see whether it would create 3 charts it does first with just female, second with male and female, third with male, female, and unknown.p  pThe chart which interests me is the last one, the one which shows the data from all the groups.

Negative 1720 pMy question stems from this process Assume an application has a host or address field and would like to connect to some service at that address. Many applications will look at that address and guess if it is an ip address or a host name. This application may use a function like inetpton to do this checking. If the address does look like an ip address, the application would not perform a DNS lookup and use that ip address directly.p  pNow, I am not suggesting this is a good idea but what if some one defined a dns name that looked like 1.2.3.4. That looks like an ip address so the application above would use that  as and ip address and not as a DNS name.p  pFrom observation, it seems most applications behave as described in the first paragraph. Which seems beneficial for a few reasons to me. Is there any documentation that states that DNS names that look like IP addresses should not be used. Or any documentation that says that even if some one defined a DNS name to look like an IP address it is OK to not honor it as such.p

For the graph Im using the Google AnnotatedTimeline visualization. Now, if I set an accordion option codeactivecode to false OR if the accordion is collapsed, whenever I try to draw the graph, it tells me the element its looking for isnt there. Is this because internally the codedivcode that is containing the graph becomes hidden when the accordion is collapsed If so, how can I fix thatp  pThe reason this is important is that the user might have that accordion collapsed while working with other elements.

Negative 1720 pI would like to execute XOR operation in my code. However I have strange behavior on the output. Sometimes the result is right but sometime its not. Heres the situation I have file which I already split into two parts and then I created one parity file using xor operation on both file source files. So now I have three files. Then I deleted one of the source file. I would like to retrieve the missing file within xor operation between parity file and the remaining source file regarding the missing file. I am using hash function to check whether the output is correct or not.

This process cannot be interrupted.p  pIs it possible to handle, say 1000 clients one thread for every 64 sockets with this methodp  pWouldnt it block the whole server if a send takes too long to complete or the client maliciously does not send the ACK or the connection gets interruptedp  pShall I split the logic of networking and request handling into 2 threads If so the thread handling the network transfers could still be blocked by a send or recv.p  pOr would it be best to use overlapped IOp

Negative 1720 pThe PHP manual and user feedback within all leave me feeling confused. Im trying to fix someone elses code where he resorted to converting all form data to ASCII codes and back.p  pThis was done as a crude way of escaping everything but is hard to maintain and the database looks like a bunch of comma separated numbers instead of a queryable database. Surely theres a surefire way in php to store a form value and retrieve it without so many contortions. The various codeescapecode and codeunescapecode functions dont seem to escape everything.p  pYou also need to check this and set this but make sure something else is not set. What gives Simply stated, whatever is in the form fields must be reliably written to MySQL columns and be easy to retrieve back into PHP and query in mysql. The form is on the intranet and the data may contain all normal keyboard input including dollar sign, percent sign, slashes and apostrophes.p
Negative 1720 pIve constructed a networkx DiGraph and calculated the standard graphlevel metrics degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and pagerank for the entire graph. However, Im more interested in isolating particular nodes, and looking at metrics relative to that particular node. p  pSo the problem is as follows given a graph G and a node X, which nodes most directly influence that particular node X Presumably I have to build a subgraph H centered at X so starting at Node X, I would walk the graph say three levels deep and use the corresponding edges to build a subgraph centered at Node X. Then I would rerun all the standard centrality metrics mentioned above on this subgraph H. Is this the best approach Is there an efficient way of doing this in networkx Should I try something else What are your recommendationsp  pThanksp

Negative 1720 pThe following is code from a university practical I am doing. It reads in a txt file of twenty clients, whose information is stored in the txt file like thisp  precodeSophia Candappa     F 23 00011   codepre  pAs per my lecturers instructions, I have stored this information in a class called Client although I know an ArrayList would be better I cant use it.br The code below is a method that is used to compare all the clients to one another and determine if they are a match. They are a match if they are all of the following  p  ol liOpposite sex    li liAge within five years of one another    li liThey have three interests in common     li ol  pThe latter is determined by the string 00011 in the example above.

Currently, if a client is matched it displays [Client Name] is compatible with then it takes a new line and outputs all the clients who are matched.

Negative 1720 pI have an unusual problem. I have a spreadsheet full of data ranging from columns AJ. I want to add a further column, K, and populate it with names of Staff. The idea is that each staff member is given an allocation of the spreadsheet. The numbers for the allocation are already calculated in another sheet, and referenced in this spreadsheet in columns M and N. M2 and down contains the staff names, N2 and down contains their corresponding allocation. p  pMy problem is figuring out how to fill column K with this data. For example APerson M2 has an allocation of 23N2, I want to populate K2 Row 1 being the header to K24 with APersons name. After that, I would like to allocate APerson2M3 with say, 15N3, which would then start at K25. I have a feeling it will involve loops but my VBA knowledge is patchy and looking around I can only find loops which fill with incremental numbers.p  pEdit Apologies for not attaching any files this was initially posted via my phone as stackoverflow is blocked at my work.

Negative 1720 pFrom the MSDN document, we can see that, we should not call LoadLibraryFreeLibrary in the DllMain entry point function.p  blockquote   pThe entrypoint function should perform only simple initialization or   termination tasks. It must not call the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx   function or a function that calls these functions, because this may   create dependency loops in the DLL load order. This can result in a   DLL being used before the system has executed its initialization code.   Similarly, the entrypoint function must not call the FreeLibrary   function or a function that calls FreeLibrary during process   termination, because this can result in a DLL being used after the   system has executed its termination code.p blockquote  pstrongMy question is Can we call FreeLibrary from ExitInstancestrong for examplep  pstrongTest.exestrong  main executablep  precodeHINSTANCE hDllMFC  LoadLibraryLTestApp.dll if hDllMFC  NULL      FreeLibraryhDllMFC   while unload the hDllMFC, the call stack looks like  TestApp.dllCTestAppAppExitInstance Line 42 C TestApp.dllInternalDllMain Line 155  C TestApp.dllDllMain Line 272  C TestApp.dllDllMainCRTStartup Line 512  C TestApp.dllDllMainCRTStartup Line 477   C ntdll.dllLdrpUnloadDll   Unknown ntdll.dllLdrUnloadDll    Unknown KernelBase.dllFreeLibrary    Unknown Test.exewmain Line 17    C codepre  pstrongTestApp.dllstrong  Regular DLLs dynamically linked to MFCp  precodeCTestApp theApp HINSTANCE hDllResource  NULL  BOOL CTestAppInitInstance      hDllResource  LoadLibraryLTestAppResource.dll      return CWinAppInitInstance   int CTestAppExitInstance      FreeLibraryhDllResource      return CWinAppExitInstance  codepre  pstrongTestAppResource.dllstrong  Regular DLLs, resourcep  p...p  pI think we should not, but from the implmentation of CWinAppExitInstance, we can see that, it was also trying to unload the resource dll.

Negative 1720 pI have been learning ASP.NET and building a little customer portal. I used the built in CreateUserWizard. I wanted to look inside the ASPNETDB.MDF file to see how it was storing the users and maybe add some rows of my own. I opened the file in SQL Server Management Studio and viewed the file. I closed it with out saving.p  pNow when I try to run the program I get this new errorp  pThe database CPROJECTSPORTALPORTALAPPDATAASPNETDB.MDF cannot be opened because it is version 706. This server supports version 662 and earlier. A downgrade path is not supported.p  pSo I assume opening the project in SQL Server it upgraded the version to 706, How can I either delete this database and create a new one or change the version of the database to an support version.p  pThanksp

Negative 1720 pId like to have a custom login form to authenticate to a web server. The server is very simple it is based on an embedded platform so I cant use complex mechanism php, asp, ssl, .... For my needs, the basic HTTP authentication is good. Moreover I need logout feature.p  pI implemented login.html, pagesprotected.html and auth.js.  The first is the index page with the login form. The submit button calls login function in auth.js.  The second is the protected page all files under pages folder are protected that should be visible only for correct login. In this page theres a logout button that calls logout function in auth.js.p  pThis is the content of auth.jsp  precodevar loginURL  login.html var logoutURL  pageslogout.html var userAgent  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase  function getHTTPObject    var xmlhttp  false    if window.XMLHttpRequest    code for IE7, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari     xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest    else                        code for IE6, IE5     xmlhttp  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP      return xmlhttp   function loginstrUrl    var user  document.getElementByIdtxtusername.value   var pass  document.getElementByIdtxtpassword.value   var http  getHTTPObject   http.openget, strUrl, false, user, pass   http.send   if http.status  200      document.location  strUrl    else      alertIncorrect username andor password      return false   function logout    if userAgent.indexOfmsie  1      document.execCommandClearAuthenticationCache, false      var http  getHTTPObject   var logouturl  login.html   http.openget, logouturl, false   http.send   document.location  logouturl   return false  codepre  pThe server is programmed to answer with 401 and WWWAuthenticate HTTP header if the request hasnt the Authorization header. It answers with 403 if the request contains Authoization header with bad credentials. In this way, I can avoid the browser login window with bad credentials.p  pWith the last Firefox version this works very well and it works also for IE. But sometimes IE insists to popup its small dialog window with userpassword text boxes, even if the credentials typed in the form are corrected.p  pI start the following loopp  ol litype correct username and passwordli liclick login and protected page appearsli liclick logoutli ligo to step 1.li ol  pAfter n time n could be 1, 5 or 10, after clicking on login button I receive the authentication form from IE.p  pAs you know, after clearing credetials cache in IE with ClearAuthenticationCache, firstly the browser sends the request without credentials even if the XMLHttpRequest object has username and password parameters. Only if the web server answers with 401 code and WWWAuthenticate header the browser sends again the request with credentials.p  pI tried to implement the strongsamestrong pages with a lighttpd server on a normal PC. In this case, it seems IE doesnt have the popup problem. So IE doesnt like too much the answer of my embedded server that is HTTP1.0.

Negative 1720 pI have an app with a handful of codeUITextViewcodes of various sizes.  It appears that if a codeUITextViewcode small enough has a font.pointSize high enough, theres no way to add a space after the text is big enough to fill the text view.p  pstrongFor examplestrongp  pIm trying to figure out what was going on here, I starting typing my usual debug string, I typed What hit the space key and no space appeared but this is usual.  I typed the and the looked like it was tacked right onto the end of the previous word.  Sure enough, there was no space.  I could go back and add the space just fine and once I do add the space, I can add other spaces as word wrapping then becomes effective.p  pAnother mysterious behavior is that when you double tap space, it doesnt add a period to the end.  It replaces the last character with a period.  So, What  space  space becomes Wha.p  pNow, Im doing some interesting things with the font size like Im automatically resizing the font so that the text fills the space provided within reasonable bounds, but when I disable that, I can still reproduce the behavior.  The only difference then is that instead of fitting on one line, the word wraps to the next line.p  pFor example, if I type What  space  the it comes out Whatthe with What on the first line and the on the second though I can only see the tops of the the.  Further, heres some log information from the codetextViewDidChangecode.p  precodeCharacter    textView.text.length      W            1 h            2 a            3 t            4 ltspacegt      4 t            5 h            6 ltspacegt      7    lt  Heres a wierd one . . . now spaces all             8           work fine unless its resizing codepre

Negative 1720 pwe are trying to solve a problem related to cluster job scheduler. p  pThe problem is the following we have a set of python scripts which are executed in a cluster, the launching process is currently done by means of the human interaction, I mean to start the test we have a bash script which interact with the cluster to request the resources needed for the execution. What we are intending to do is to build an automatic launching process which should be sound in the sense that it realizes the job status and based on that wait the job ending, restart the execution, etc.... Basically we have to implement a layer between the user workstation and the cluster.p  pAnother additional difficulty is that our layer must be clever enough to interact with the different cluster job schedulers. We wonder if there exists a tool or framework which help us to interact with the cluster without having to deal with each cluster scheduler details. We have searched in the web but we did not find anything suitable for our needs.p  pBy the way the programming language we use is Python.p  pThanks in advancep  pBr.p

Negative 1720 pI relatively simple question regarding XPM this time. Its about creating Page Type which editors could use to base their new website page on. When defining a Page Type, you can use an exisiting page to enable this as an example page, including its components. You can copy these components to enable editors to edit these freely without tampering with existing pages using these components as well. On the SDL Live content docs they explain the followingp  blockquote   pChange the setting from Include this Component Presentation to   Include a Component Presentation that contains a copy of this   Component. If you use this Component in multiple Component   Presentations on this Page, then saving the Page causes all of those   Component Presentations to have the setting you configured last for   any of those Component Presentations. A number of new controls appear.p blockquote  pThis means that whenever an editor clicks new page within XPM, this page type is available and the components that are defined inside it are copied with userspecific prefixes. You can define this inside the page defined as a Page Type itself, by clicking on the component presentations tab, then clicking on a component and selecting Page Type settings. note the followingp  pa hrefhttpimgur.comQzIifUe relnofollowimg srchttpi.imgur.comQzIifUe.png alt titleHosted by imgur.com ap  pAs you can see, the copy of the content is being created in 050  Web  Global, which is, in our blueprint, the wrong publication. However, in the popup you cannot select the correct content location, only the one where the page type is residing.p  pIve tested this, also with the UI specific blueprint context settings, where you emshouldem define where content and pages are created. However, when creating a new page, the components are copied inside 050  web  global the wrong publication. As were moving to a training, Id imagine that dynamically created components like this might clog the CMS with content in the wrong location, making it unusable for other publications. Is there a reason for this behaviour, and if so, a way to make this work properlyp

Negative 1720 pI am developing a responsive website that is very image heavy. Imagine a grid of images like Pinterest for argument sake. Layered on top of these images are divs containing basic meta data such as title, author, etc. which I am dynamically vertically centering in the thumbnail image. p  pI am using JavaScript to dynamically calculate on the fly as I dont know what viewport size someone is visiting the site on andor if they resize their browser widow the height of the thumbnail image and centering the div of meta data within it.p  pThis approach seems to work pretty well except for one thing, and I suspect this is the issue... When the page initially loads the div containing meta data starts at the bottom of the image container and then moves up after the image height and image center is determined by JavaScript. In effect, from a UX perspective, it doesnt look so great to watch this hickup occur. I imagine I need to implement some sort of callback function or delay so that the CSS applied to the meta div is applied ONLY AFTER the image thumbnail height is calculated.p  pBelow are snippets of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you understand what is going on with my code.

Also, this property is stored in the myTextBlockSize ApplicationData variable to preserve its value when the app is closed and reopened.p  pThe solution works but THE PROBLEM is when I enter the settings pane charm bar  settings  settings and change the textblock fontsize property through the slider, then I come back to the homepageview and reopen the settings pane, the fontsize property is reinitialized to its original value so it doesnt keep the previous user selected value. Can you fix my code please Thank you very much in advance.p
Negative 1720 pWe have a server which exposes a set of REST APIs. Those APIs are meant to be exposed for clients on different platform so we want to provide SDKs in Java and .NETp  pThe SDKs are using similiar interface definitions we keep duplicating interface decration in both languages.

All testing effort becomes doubled.p  pWe are thinking to write 2 debugger application, on both SDKs respectively. The applications then can load command scripts which  is implemented in Python.

Negative 1720 pI have a problem regarding the system performance. In the DB table there will be a big XML data in every record. My concern is that if I should parse the XML data each time from the DB to get the attributes and information in the XML. The other choice could be parsing the XML once and catching them. The XML size averages 100KB and there will be 1010 records. How to solve this space vs computing performance problem My guess is to catch the resultimportant attributes in the XML. Because parsing 1010 records per query is not a easy task. Plus the parsed attributes can be used as the index.p

In one class it appears to be whichever reference is listed first, everything works fine, no error.

Negative 1720 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pI have an application that imports lab instrument data while it is running. This data is imported and then displayed in a codeListViewcode at an interval set by the enduser as per his or her testing requirements. When a value of interest appears in this codeListViewcode that they watch, they then press a Start button and the application begins performing calculations on that datum and subsequent data until a Stop button is pressed. So on the left side of the screen is a View for displaying the imported data and on the right side is another View for watching the values and statistics as they are calculated and displayed.p  pstrongThe Current Codestrongp  pThe View that displays the ListView where data is imported to is the ImportProcessView.xaml and it sets its codeDataContextcode to the codeImportProcessViewModel.cscode. The VM Ive just introduced has a property codeObservableCollectionltIrDatagtcode that the ListView, Ive also just described, binds to. Now to the interesting part...p  pThe codeImportProcessViewcode has a codeContentControlcode that sets its content dynamically a UserControl representing the controls and fields specific to the type of Phase that is chosen by the enduser.p  precodeltStackPanel BackgroundWhite Margin5gt     ltContentControl ContentBinding CurrentPhaseViewgt ltStackPanelgt codepre  pThere are three codePhaseViewscode, each in its own User Control and each sets its codeDataContextcode to the codeImportProcessViewModelcode. As a result I am getting some severe VM bloat to the tune of 2000 lines. Ridiculous. I know. The reason for the bloat is because the codeImporProcessViewModelcode is maintaining state through properties for each of the three PhaseViews and not only that but contains methods for performing calculations whose data is stored and displayed in these PhaseViews.p  pstrongWhat I am trying to achievestrongp  pObviously before the codeImportProcessViewModelcode becomes more unwieldy, I need to break it up so that each PhaseView has its own ViewModel, but also such that each ViewModel maintains a relationship back to the ImportProcessViewModel for sake of the dependency imposed by the ObservableCollection of codeIrDatacode.p  pstrongRampDstrongp  pIve done my research on ViewModels communicating with each other, but most of the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4892731wpfmvvmhowdoviewmodelscommunicatewitheachotherresultsa involve applications that were written with a specific MVVM framework.

Negative 1720 pI am running into a problem here, and I have no code needed or that requires debugging. Im looking for more of an idea to solve this issue, so here it is.p  pI have a .exe that is a command prompt utility that generates images. What I am doing is using this utility for my asp.net website. In the background I do processing for each date in a asp.net calendar. If the image doesnt exist in the images directory for that date, CalendarDayRender calls the backend to use the exe via Process. The image creation works great. As does the loading, if the image was already created in a previous session by any other user.p  pThe problem is that the images are being created too quicky and I cannot load the image because when I try to add the Image to the cell, it wasnt created quickly enough. Any ideas on how I can solve this timing issuep

Negative 1720 pIm trying to develop an application userinterface within an iOS application. The iOS application supports JavaScript and SVG this iOS application also has an editor in which I am developing the interface. The idea is to use SVG for the graphics developed in Illustrator or InkScape and then JavaScript to handle animations, calculation or logic. p  pWith that being said I am familiar with using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM of an HTML. I cant seem to do the same in this environment. Common methods like codegetElementByIdcode, codeownerDocumentcode, codesetIntervalcode dont work. In general common document or window level methods that are used in HTML do not seem to work. p  pSo Im guessing that this is because there is no DOM for JS to interact with. What then could the equivalent be Is there some sort of abstractionhierarchy of that javascript defaults to when its not being used in conjunction with HTMLp

Negative 1720 pI use Windsor Castle quite a while now. It is just perfect for environments where data is located in a database or the like, where the repository pattern or the unitofwork pattern do work well.p  pNow I do have a different situation I have a complex object model that is assembled by a lot of single PONOs. The environment is strongly influenced by COM, to make it more explicit Excel, Word PIOs are heavily used. p  pI do use the command pattern, I implemented the ICommandHandler like described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6617976dependencyinjectionwhenusingthecommandpatternherea but with one difference. As I do want to assembly commands to a list of commands to call them in a run without knowing anything beside the general command pattern described , it does not make to introduce the context when calling the execute method. So the interface does look like thisp  precode    public interface ICommand              void Execute         bool CanExecute      codepre  pExecution of commands with that interface is effective and easy to understand. On the other hand it is a problem to introduce the context with the ctor because therefore the Container must be called explicitely to e.g. add ctor parameters. p  pSo I actually have two questionsp  ol liIs it possible to inject a  lets call it a context, a part of the object model  automatically by Windsor castle without calling the container explictely li liHow to participate from the command pattern by using DI Any ideas how to accomplish being able to define a list of tasks actions or the like by following the RRR rule described a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20100929TheRegisterResolveReleasepattern relnofollowhereali ol

Negative 1720 pI have an asp.net website with client javascript making lots of ajax calls back to the server. Is there any way I can prevent a google chrome extension from calling my ajax endpoints or to detect when they are being made by the chrome extension code and not my own javascript code. So far I have tested using the referer, httponly cookies, but there is no difference between the 2 calls. Any ideas would be appreciated.p

Negative 1720 pI just listened a dba say that if you name all your functions, procedures etc in uppercase, the db will perform better when the workload in the database is high. Is this any true at all I find that nearly impossible to believe. Is there any benchmark or something that prove him right or wrongp  pI only think that this naming things have value when reading code, specially for a team. It is more likely that you can successfully modify code that is written following good writing conventions than just random stuff. But this has nothing to do with the computer performance, it should execute just the same.p  pAlso, if it was like this, I should not be able to invoque a function named codeFUNCcode like codefunccode or codeFunccode or codefunCcode.p  pI think that statement is crazy, Im I wrong I mean, Im not a database expert at all and he is a dba.p

This still count as one turn.li ul  pThe game ends when no move is possible and the player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally. Both players calculate the outcome of the game before the game begins. The player who loses tries to maximize the number of turns in the game and player who wins tries to minimize the turns. No player can pass more than P times. A starts the game. Output the name of the winner and the number of moves in the game separated by a single space. 0 lt X, Y, P lt 1000p  pI came up with an On3 DP solution but surely it is not good enough for this problem considering the bounds.

Then we havep  precoded[i, j]  0 if i  j  0           1 if i  0 ampamp j gt 0 or i gt 0 ampamp j  0 or i  j ampamp i gt 0           minmind[ip, j], mind[i, jq, minir, jr if a each substate is a losing position           max of all winning position substate if no losing substate is found codepre  pFinally, coded[i,j]  d[i,j]  2P if [i,j]code is a winning state and you will not win immediately from the start.p  pAs you can see from the formulation above, this is a On3 solution.

Negative 1720 pI have an opportunity to preset dictionary for deflate compression. It makes sense in my case, because data to be compressed is relatively small 1kb3kb and I have a large sample of representative examples. Data to be compressed consists of arbitrary sequence of bytes, so tokenization etc. is not a good way to go. Also, data shows a lot of repetition between data examples, so good dictionary could potentially give very good results.

Negative 1720 pI have a generic scenario but I put it specific to make it easy to answer.p  pI have model Image which has fields for name, url, camera, format, createddate, uploadeddate, and some more. these are the EXIF info. would have preferred a manytomany field for these as tags but I worried it gets too complicated.p  pI have another model File, which has a foreignkey Image field and a foreignkey User field. if two different Users have the same Image, there will be one Image object and two File objects for the Users directing to that Image.p  pNow there are two tasks I need to perform. 1 find all different cameras a User has. or formats, etc. 2 filter all of the User Files by a specific camera.p  pI cant figure out the more efficient artitecture for this case.p  pThanks so much for helping. p

Negative 1720 pI have a backup script I run on an UBUNTU 12.04 server box that is supposed to shut the virtual machines computer down, execute a tar backup, then reboot the virtual machine when backup is complete.

Negative 1720 pI have a WCF service that performs a search and returns a list of reasonably complex objects to the client.  This is an EAV system, so each entity that is returned has a list of values attached that varies in size depending on the entity blueprint.p  pIn my test search, I have confirmed through logging that the actual search takes under a second to complete in almost every case.  The very last thing I do before returning the response to the client is log that processing has finished.p  pUnfortunately the client does not receive the response until 1520 seconds after I have finished with it.  The total response size is about 250kb, so pretty small.  This is being transmitted via LAN at the minute and I have tried disabling the firewall and antivirus to make sure neither is interfering.p  pI noticed, however, that if the response was considerably smaller, for instance by removing the fields attached to each entity, that the response came through a lot faster.  I also tried stepping through a locally hosted IIS copy of the service, and after passing the final codereturncode statement it still took another 15 seconds to reach the local client application.p  pI am using basicHttpBinding as the service will be consumed by both .Net and PHP clients.p  pNow then, can anyone suggest a way I can confirm that this is indeed the case  And how might I fix the cripplingly slow serialization timesp  pstrongEditstrongp  pTo clarify, I have marked each class with the [DataContract] attribute and each property with [DataMember]  WCF is handling the serialization when I return the data.

Negative 1720 pSo I have a basic form in my application that I am hosting using Google App Engine. When I type in a particular query, say CN, I want the CN.html file to be rendered. I have redirected my path and stuff, and used ifelse to allow CN.html file to be rendered when CN is queried. However, all the inline CSS commands inside the CN.html are not considered, and all I get redirected to when I query CN is to the basic HTML document void of all the CSS commands. Also, the images are not displayed.p  pNow, I have put the CN.html file in a folder called templates in my directory and all the images in a folder called images.p  pNOTE templates and images also contain the html file of my front page and their images respectively.

Negative 1720 pI am new to mobile development. I am given with an Android project to develop with PhoneGap. I have just successfully installed PhoneGap on eclipse. Now I am wondering whether development with Phonegap allows server communication with php.p  pI am basically a web developer with intermediate knowledge of PHP and MySQL. I am aware that mobile devices are slower than desktopslaptops and most likely to have a slower bandwidth connection. In this case, will this be effective to use PHP as a server side language and MySQL as my choice of database p  pIn web applications, I used to create an include file, header and footer pages. Include file with server connection code, header file with js and css links for the header and footer with js and css files for the footer content. I hope most of the web devs here do the same. Can this method be used with phonegap mobile applications as well p  pI did searched over the internet to find a solution for my questions, but I couldnt find anything specific or particular solution for this.p  pNote  The mobile application project I am working on requires to contact the server very frequently as it is for a shopping portal and I am going to use Jquery Mobile for the application UI.p

Negative 1720 pI use Google Maps in an app and it is likely that multiple markers are attached to same location where each marker represent a person. In this situation user will not know that there are other markerspersons behind this particular marker.p  pI looked around to handle this situation and one question on SO suggests that I can display a single marker and associate all persons with that single marker. When user taps that marker I should display a list of all the user associated with that marker. This is a good workaround but I would want to avoid displaying a view that mostly hides Google Maps.p  pHas anyone used any workaround in similar situationp

Negative 1720 pSo everybody seems to be asking why one cannot push strongfromstrong a shallow clone while I actually already achieved this. However what Im interested in is pushing strongtostrong a shallow server.p  pThis doesnt work Ive served the git repo via git clone bare depth 1 theoriginalrepo in my server, and I cannot clone from it because it says it is a shallow clone. But Im thinking that if one tries to clone with the same depth as the shallow clone was created, why would we have the limitationp  pMy endgoal would be something like this setupp  precode          shallowSERVER                         fullhistoryclient  shallowclient codepre  pThis way, both shallow nodes would have no history at all, but there would be a client which has the full history. If the shallowclient pushed to the shallowserver, it would mean that their depth increases, but ideally it would decrease again when the fullhistoryclient pulls from the server.p  pI guess this is not doable with git nowadays, rightp

Negative 1720 pIm testing a very simple page that swipes out the content within a phonegap app.  I started with jquery mobile swipeleft and swiperight and it didnt work.

As soon as I added any images both frameworks didnt recognize the swipe and wouldnt switch out the content.  So Im assuming its a drawback to phonegapcordova and images.p  pI thought maybe it was related to my css and positioning of the divs that the images were contained within.

Negative 1720 pWhen using manual memory management we can write a call to a method which is not declared in the class. What we get during compilation in this case is warning only. This is what Wikipedia states on one of the most distinctive ObjectiveC featuresp  blockquote   pThe ObjectiveC model of objectoriented programming is based on message passing to object instances. In ObjectiveC one does not simply call a method one sends a message. This is unlike the Simulastyle programming model used by C. The difference between these two concepts is in how the code referenced by the method or message name is executed. In a Simulastyle language, the method name is in most cases bound to a section of code in the target class by the compiler. In Smalltalk and ObjectiveC, the target of a message is resolved at runtime, with the receiving object itself interpreting the messagep blockquote  pSo why it is compilation error in ARC What are the reasons to break such a powerful feature of the language Whats so important about that im not aware of Can anybody explain this Thanksp

Negative 1720 pWe are currently in the process of analyzing the technical requirements for a new version of a Java EE application. Its Java EE 6, but moving onto 7 is an option. Until now this was a single application, one EAR, offering welldefined functionality. However, it needs to become possible to define some functionality in a very specific way based on implementation project andor customer.p  pFor example, some customers are going to have very specific security constraints. A list of messages processed by a framework can be shown. For one customer, its okay to have users see everything, but another customer would like to show only certain types of messages based on the users group. Thats an example of defining an implementation in a contextspecific way, adapting the core functionality. Another possible requirement is that some customers will want to expand on the given functionality, adding new possibilities. So thats the extensible part.p  pBecause of this, it is necessary to have an architecture that defines generic functionality but has pluggable parts, as well as a possibility for extension. For some aspects I have a rough idea of how this could be handled. This question has an answer that would work perfectly for the presentation layer, which well do in JSF 2 a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6199458howtocreateamodularjsf20applicationHow to create a modular JSF 2.0 applicationap  pIm less certain about the business logic layer, security etc. My initial idea would be to define interfaces a couple of facades and find the implementation at runtime or deployment time. In much the same way as the service provider mechanism. A default implementation can be offered, with the possibility of defining a custom one. This does feel like a sort of Java SE solution, and Im wondering if Im just applying concepts that Im familiar with from that context and if theres nothing better for EE. I think the codeAlternativecode annotation serves a purpose like this.p  pAnother possibility might be to use interceptors and decorators. Im not certain to what extent interceptors are useful outside of logging, auditing and other things that dont touch the core business logic. Decorators seem suitable for allowing an implementation to be extended with custom functionality, and perhaps also the pluggable parts.p  pCan someone offer some insight into which solution is best for which part of this challenge Should I combine these methods for various parts of the problem domain Are there possibilities Im not seeingp  pAn important requirement we want to make it possible to keep the code that is specific to a customerproject separate. We dont want to have a complete version of the application under version control for each implementation, as that would become a maintenance nightmare fast. Ideally, it would also not be necessary to build this as a monolithic EAR, but be capable of adding pluggable parts to some lib folder or deploy them separately.p

Negative 1720 pIm working on a web page that uses a lot of CSS animations mostly TranslateY that are triggered at various scroll positions through JQuery. It works great across Webkit, FF, IE, etc. Unfortunately, on iPhone and iPad, some but not all of the elements just dont appear. Im aware of the differences of scrolling on mobile versus desktop and have confirmed that the class being added to fire the animations is actually getting added. p  pI plugged the iPad into my desktop and have been using Safaris Mobile Web Inspector to poke around... whats really weird is that I have confirmed that the animations are firing and the divs are moving around, they just arent visible... UNTIL I add a line of style to the div in the inspector. As soon as I start typing anything, literally even just a blank line, the element appears This has me totally stumped. Ive tried adding a zindex but dont know what else to do.p  pIm using Safari 6.1.1, the latest version as of this writing.

Negative 1720 pIve been writing some code in Dart.  I really love the factory constructor, but Im afraid that Im abusing its usefulness.  In particular, when I write a value object class, I sometimes return null if the validation fails.p    pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodeclass EmailAddress    static final RegExp regex  new RegExp...   final String value    factory EmailAddressString input      return regex.hasMatchinput  new EmailAddress.internalinput  null       const EmailAddress.internalthis.value    toString gt value  codepre  pAt first, this doesnt seem all that bad.  However, when you actually use it, this is what you see.p  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodemethodThatCreatesAnEmailAddress    var emailAddress  new EmailAddressdefinitely not an email address   ...  codepre  pThe argument why this is bad is that a developer coming from another statically typed language, such as Java or C, would expect codeemailAddresscode to always be initialized to a nonnull value.  The argument why this is perfectly acceptable is that the constructor is factory and, as such, is allowed to return a codenullcode value.p  pSo is this bad practice or taking advantage of a useful featurep

Once the Dialog appears, the user types in title and description of a Project class that is then being saved to an ArrayList in HomeFragment. The objects in this ArrayList get updated with this input data, but my HomeFragment does not display the input data. Currently I am trying to use getFragmentManager...Transition...replace..commit routine and tried a number of other unsuccessful methods and it is giving me a NullPointerException.

Negative 1720 pI have a grid layoutroot of two columns. I have a list of checkboxes in each of these columns.  If a checkbox is checked I need to add some text below it.  I was unable to find a way to add a textbox below a checkbox dynamically which would not overlap with the checkbox right below it so I thought of adding the text to be added to the CheckBox text and when this text exceeds the width, it should move to a new line. p  pNow, this is not the case right now. The checkbox trims any text that is larger than its width. Is there are way to let a checkbox grow in height like a cangrow property of reports  Or is there a workaround that would allow me to add a textbox in between two existing checkboxes and expanding the layout vertically p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1720 pI am using jQuery and a DataTable with a custom faceted navigation.  I create a pipe delimited list of values of each of the checkboxes to populate the fnFilter for the dataTable.  Uncheck a box and it rebuilds the list without that value.  It works fine except where there are values like Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.  If the Engineering value is checked, but the Mechanical Engineering value is not, Mechanical Engineering is not limited out since the Engineering value meets the criteria for both.

Negative 1720 pmy button on the Nexus S 480x800 looks pretty good. It takes a bit less than a fourth of the screens height. When I open my app on the Nexus 10 2560x1600 the botton seems to be a lot smaller. Im looking for a way where my button is scaling correctly proportionally to the screen size. So that my button takes even on the Nexus 10 the same room of the empty screen as it does on the Nexus S.  I know that there are drawable folders, but they arent solving my problem correctly. For example The Nexus 10 and the Galaxy Nexus are both xhdpi. The screen of the Nexus 10 is way bigger though. So my button would take different amounts of room on these devices.p  pThanks p

Negative 1720 pGiven a standard SVN server on a GNUlinux host which I dont have admin permissions to, and clients that are all using windows, mostly through TortoiseSVN, I need to make one repository read only for all clients.p  pI understand I may be able to do this with a precommit hook but I couldnt seem to get it working so idiot proof instructions of how to apply this to the repository would be appreciated. Also note that all clients are on windows not nix.p  pIf possible it would be nice if clients who had already checked out and so may not have updated to retrieve the new hook were also blocked from writing to the repository but it may be that this is not possible. p

Negative 1720 pMy app performs timeconsuming onetime initialization in strongdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsstrong. I would like to display an alert, strongUIAlertViewstrong, to inform the user about this condition, but the alert never shows up until strongdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsstrong completes, even if shown with code[alert performSelectorselectorshow withObjectnil afterDelay0.0]code.p  pMoving onetime initialization to post strongdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsstrong is not possible, due to the fact that strongdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsstrong has to set the main windows root view controller, which needs the initialization. Setting up a throwaway dummy root view controller in strongdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsstrong, covered or replaced later, seems somewhat... inelegant.p  pIdeasp

Negative 1720 pIm trying to work out if bound service is appropriate for doing background work in my app. The requirements are that various application components can make web requests through it of varying priority. Thus the service must maintain some sort of queue and be able to cancel its ongoing requests for others of higher priority. Id like the service to be relatively unobtrusive to the user such that they dont find it running after they are done with the application  if I want to do something more important that continues while the application is closed I can use startForeground to push a notification during the process.p  pstrongSolution the first bind from the activitystrongp  pSo, for a given application component it should be able to bind to the service to get work done. But there  seems to be a well known problem that if an activity is doing the binding, the binding will be lost during configuration change rotation as the activity will be closed.p  pSo, I was thinking I could use another context that I create codenew Contextcode and bind from that to the service, then use a nonUI fragment to maintain this context across config changes  until I deem that I am finished with it. I could do this only during the configuration change or as a permanent alternative to binding from the activity. I should probably point out that this is a standard and a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesruntimechanges.htmlRetainingAnObject relnofollowrecommendeda way to maintain instances across config changesp  pstrongSolution numero 2strongp  pThe main alternative I see is that I can use the application context to do the binding  but could this persist too long andor could there be some cyclic relationship between the app context and the service thus preventing the service and the app context being destroyedp  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pSo the question Im trying to answer to myself is should I use the first method activities with temporary contexts Or the second just bind service to the app contextp  pAm I right in thinking the app context can bind to the service multiple times and then unbind from it the same number of times I.e. that you can have multiple valid bindings PER contextp  pCould using my own context codenew Contextcode in the first solution cause any issuesp  pstrongEditstrongp  pFound some more information a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicandroiddevelopersNb58dOQ8Xfw relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicandroiddevelopersNb58dOQ8Xfwap  pIt also seems that it will difficult to create a context arbitrarily so a combination of solution 1 and 2 seems appropriate where the service connection is maintained across the configurations change but the binding is to the app context. I am still concerned about the possibility of unbinding twice from the app context. Keeping count of the bindings myself seems unnecessary  can anyone confirmdeny that bindings are per connection and not per contextp

Negative 1720 pProblem on Windows 7, due to the fact that we cant use nfs naturally, without hacks, the performance of the couple VagrantMagento are really poor.p  pAfter so much research, i found that the best way maybe the only to solve the problem is to use rsync. Ok, i succeed to use it and the performancies now are really goodp  pI found a problem it seems to be that rsync is monodirectional. What i mean Suppose I do install magento succesfully and then i call vagrant rsync command. It will perform a new sync of the folders and, cause it sync the guest file structure with the host file structure, it will delete the etcapplocal.xml file that Magento has built for me after the installation, just beacause it doesnt exist in the host file structure.p  pNow, i read some solution like exclude folders or file from sync, but i think its really not a great way to solve the problem.p  pSomeone has a better solution There is a way to sync bidirectionally the two file structuresp  pUPDATEp  pI tried to find a solution.p  p1 I tried to use unison, but i found some kind of error i cant understand. 2 I tried to use the vagrant plugin rsyncback, but it seems it cant find the right folders to sync 3 I finally choose to execute the rsync within the virtual machine. Access through vagrant ssh, execute the command rsync av varwww vagrant. It seems to work.p  pSo, for the moment, the solution to improve the performance of Vagrant and Magento is to activate the rsync system. To solve the unidirectional sync problem, I need to execute the rsync command from the VM if i need to sync from guest to host viceversa, its enough to use vagrant rsync.p  pIf you have a better way, please, give it to mep

Negative 1720 pThe Question Is there a way to change the size of the SVG viewbox with CSS, but preserve the aspect ratio OR is there another way to preserve the aspect ratio of the SVG without a view box.p  pThe Problem I want to responsively adjust the size of the SVG, but keep the aspect ratio.  The width of the viewbox adjusts with the page, but the height doesnt adjust with the width. The problem with that is that the height of the container div is dependent on the height of the viewbox.  So the container div may be really tall even if theres nothing showing in the bottom half of the viewbox.p  pFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethT9Jb1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethT9Jb1ap  precodeltstylegt     div         width 100         height 500px         backgroundcolor 00ffff           svg         width 50         backgroundcolor ffff00      ltstylegt  ltdivgt     ltsvg version1.1 idLayer1 x0px y0px width250px height400px viewBox0 0 250 400 enablebackgroundnew 0 0 250 400 aspectratioXminYmingt         ltrect x0 y0 fillFF0000 width250 height400gt     ltsvggt ltdivgt codepre  pObject SVGs and img SVGs wont work for my purposes.

Negative 1720 pIve gone through the Entity Framework codefirst tutorials and I hate to say but Im at a loss for how it works. Everything works but I want to know how because everything I know about basic database design tells me it shouldnt. I feel like Im missing a critical link with how its creating foreign keys and hope someone can explain it.p  pI initially copied and pasted a bunch of codefirst designs of a simple Parent class with multiple child types. In my child types I had a reference to the virtual Parent and a codeParentIDcode reference. I noticed in the database that the value of codeParentIDcode was 0 for every single child of type A and B.  p  pstrongHowever, when loading the data in code and debuggingdisplaying, entity relationships were correctly maintained.strong  p  pThe code looks like class names were changed to remove context of what it isp  precodepublic class Parent     public int ParentID getset     public virtual ChildA ChildA getset     public virtual ChildB ChildB getset   public class ChildA     [Key,ForeignKeyParent]     public int ChildAID getset      public string Field getset      public int ParentID getset      [ForeignKeyParentID]     public virtual Parent Parent getset   public class ChildB     [Key,ForeignKeyParent]     public int ChildBID getset      public string Field getset      public int ParentID getset      [ForeignKeyParentID]     public virtual Parent Parent getset  codepre  pI commented out the codeParentIDcode to show explicitly what I was talking about. To test this out, I deleted the column in the database and yet the relationships still work correctly. There are only three tables that relate to this in the database Parent, ChildA, and ChildB. There arent any foreign keys, and the parent table doesnt reference the children tables and the children tables dont reference the parent table. When I load them from the codeDBContextcode, the mappings correctly load them as I saved them. p  pWhat am I missing here Something somewhere is keeping track of this mapping but I cant tell where. And the fact that it isnt stored as a really basic foreign key in the database concerns me about performance.p

Negative 1720 pIm using Xcode 5 to make an UIButton. I made the button in storyboard and set the background image to a .png of a circle with transparency. I set up a simple action for the button to display how many times it was pressed in a label.p  pWhen I press the corners of the circle on the screen, it still adds to the score. So the button is still keeping its square hitbox, even though it has a round image as its background. I searched everywhere for a way to make a circular hitbox, but I cant find anything. Is this even possible Is there an alternative way to do thisp

Negative 1720 pFrom what I understand, Intuit is no longer allowing proprietary integrations with QuickBooks Desktop editions through the Sync Manager and only allowing apps that are put into the marketplace.  Is this really the case  If so, is there a timeline for when they will start allowing this  Also, it seems that the supported objects for desktop editions is way behind those supported for the online edition.  Will these be available any time soon i.e. reports such as balance sheet, profitloss, budget, etc.p  pI ask because we have been using the web connector for a couple of years now and it is not built for the type of use we need.  To be specific, we are a franchising company that has a hosted QB solution for each of our franchises.  We then pull data and pass jobs to and from our proprietary POS application through the web connector.  We run into all sorts of problems with multiple web connectors being open on the same system trying to connect to different files and a host of other issues.  Because of this, we are hoping that a more reliable integration can be developed through the Sync Manager.p  pThank you in advance for all your responses.p

Many of our applications running under the VMs do not handle this time jump well, so we want to prevent this from happening. p  pSo my question is how can I configure my VMs to start with the same time as their host In the test I just ran, my hosts time was 1400 PDT. A VM I created under that host came up with an initial time of 2100 PDT. This was adjusted by NTP to 1400 PDT shortly after it started to 1400 PDT, matching the hosts time, and subsequent reboots of the VM always had the correct time. The problem only occurs on the first boot. I want the VM to come up with 1400 PDT one the very first boot to avoid the NTP time jump.p

Negative 1720 pI am a Dot Net programmer that is now learning PHP just for fun and to see how PHP handles certain things. For me the basic concepts are easy because they are more or less common to web programming and programming in general like OOP, Sessions, Security etc. However there seem to be some areas which are confusing me as PHP is built differently from Dot Net world. One of those things is Phar files. In Dot Net we are so used to creating loosely coupled assemblies that we reuse everywhere. However in PHP most of the books that I have read and code I have seen will just create classes and use them directly in the project. The confusion that I have right now isp  ul liAre Phar files simmilar to dll files in Dot Net worldli liIf so why they are not used oftenli liIs their any performance hit when using Phar fileli liCan I use Phar files aggressively to create reusable code librariesli ul  pKindly guide me if you have a lot of PHP experience, I want to know how the experts of PHP handle things.p

Negative 1720 pUpdate I lean towards extracting data from Wikipedia and creating the picker myself a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListoftimezonesbycountry relnofollowList of time zones by countrya and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDaylightsavingtimebycountry relnofollowdaylight saving time by countrya. It still has some issues I dont get all official names of the time zones and I have to provide for daylight saving times myself. Also providing different languages might be a problem.p  pI want the users of my web site to be able to pick their time zone or in fact also use the site with time zones other than their own. My current idea to make it feasible is to make the user select their country first, then offer a list of time zones from that country to select. Selecting the country would be optional, without the country there would be a list of all available time zones to choose from.p  pEverything on the web points to the Olson database, but I have issues with it. I would prefer to display the official time zones for a country, not the weird Olson names. For example according to a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiTimeintheUnitedStates relnofollowWikipedia on US time zonesa the USA officially has 9 timezones , but the Olson database seems to provide at least 31 time zones for the US. Overall I think the Olson database has way too many entries, and it is not clear to me how to boil them down to the official time zones.p  pI dont like the solution of a map based picker very much, either, because not everybody might be aware of their current location on the map.p  pOf course I will offer automatic location, but that is only a nice to have add on. Also it wouldnt help for users who want to get data for a different time zone than their own.p  pMany thanks in advance for any ideasp  pEdit I accept that I may have to go via geography.

Negative 1720 pIm trying to create a function that asks the user for a value, which then will be stored as the max or min value entered, or if the user inputs a number lt 0, it will exit the dataentry function, else it will keep asking the user for input.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  void dataentry  int count  0 float max, min, mean, old, new float data char Old[10],Data[10],choice[25]  int mainvoid      dataentry   void dataentry      printf  Enter Wind Speed Valuen     printfEnter 1 to exit data entry moden      fgetsOld, sizeofOld, stdin     sscanfOld, f,ampold      max  old     min  old     data  1     count  1      printfmaxf, minf, dataf, countd., max, min, data, count      for count  1data gt 0 count              printfnEnter data value           fgetsData, sizeofData, stdin   I commented this out because I got a coredump error with it in         sscanfData,f, ampdata         if data gt max                      max  data                  else if data lt min ampamp data gt 0                      min  data                codepre  pAfter the program prompts you the first time to enter data, before it reaches the for loop, it works and you enter your value. Then however it goes into an infinite loop printing Enter data value  over and over. I used the printf statement that prints out the max, min, data, and count values so I could check that they are being stored and they are, but when the function gets to the for loop it no longer does what Im trying to do. Thank you in advance, this function is part of a larger program Im writing but I cut all the irrelevant stuff out.p
Negative 1720 pI am working with a Qt application and trying to implement UI automation through the accessibility interface. This all works well except for the fact that this application has a codeQMdiAreacode which contains codeQMdiSubWindowcodes and anything contained within these sub windows is completely opaque to the automation interface. I tried to inspect the elements through codeUIAVerifycode from the Windows SDK which shows the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEPMkK.png altMDI areap  pThese subwindows contain a standard grid layout which contains standard Qt widgets. Since the heirachy here entirely consists of standard Qt widgets and all standard Qt widgets implement the accesibility interface as defined by MSAA I dont understand why all elements in the MDI area are hidden when I can freely access elements in all other areas of the GUI.p

Negative 1720 pWe are using ActiveMQ 5.3.1 as a standalone broker in our system, and every so often we get a big spike in messages intentional, for example on failover, we resubscribe. We currently have ProducerFlowControl turned on, as this seemed a sensible way to stop components from falling over during these spikes.p  pHowever, it seems we have an issue with the Flow Control  once it kicks in, the Producers seem to lock indefinitely, even once all inflight messages have been consumed. As soon as we see the message p  precodeUsage Manager memory limit 1048576 reached codepre  pOur producers can no longer send any messages to the topic. This seems odd  I thought it would be more of a oneinoneout policy. I read somewhere that FlowControl does not work very well for Async Topic producers which is exactly what we have so I am wondering if there is a better way to configure thisp  pAlso, how long does Flow Control last once it has kicked in Will it throttle producers on that topic forever until ActiveMQ is restarted until producers are restarted or does it last a fixed or configurable amount of time eg it waits for consumer to empty the topic, then waits 5 minutesp  pAny help would be appreciated. We are currently investigating turning Flow Control off and using Filebased cursors instead. Any obvious downside with that approachp

Negative 1720 pIm working on adding a simple 1D Kalman Filter to an application to process some noisy input data and output a cleaned result.p  pThe example code Im using comes from the SingleVariable example section of a hrefhttpgreg.czerniak.infoguideskalman1 relnofollowthis tutoriala and a hrefhttpgreg.czerniak.infoguideskalman1kalman1.py.txt relnofollowthis python codea.p  pThis is working well for calculating the resulting value, however, when I first read about Kalman Filters I was under the impression that they could also be used for giving some measurement about how much error is in the inputs.p  pAs an example, say Im measuring an value of 10 but my input has a large amount of error. My input data may look like 6, 11, 14, 5, 19, 5, etc some gaussian distribution around 10.p  pBut say I switch to a lessnoisy measurement and the measurements are 9.7, 10.3, 10.1, 10.0, 9.8, 10.1.p  pIn both cases, the Kalman Filter will theoretically converge to a proper measurement of 10. What I want is to also have it give me some sort of numerical value estimating how much error there was in these data streams.p  pI believe this should be quite possible with a Kalman Filter, however, Im having trouble finding a resource describing this. How can I do thisp

If you are pressing the joystick in the max left position and then you do ACTIONUP and then instantly ACTIONDOWN in the joystick again but in the max right position, the spaceship starts moving to the right at max speed. strongIt is hard to explain it. For example, If you press the joystick in max left position the spaceship is moving 20px per frame to the left and if you press the joystick in the max right position, the spaceship moves to the right 20px per frame.strongp  pstrongSo, now, if i do a fast max left and max right touch on the joystick, the spaceship does this movement 20....20strongp  pIt is not reallistic movement.p  pstrongI want to get this movement 20 17 14 9 5 0 5 9 14 17 20.... I mean a more reallistic spaceship movement.strong But the problem is that i am not a math or physics expert, and i dont have any idea of how to get that kind of functionality in this joystick... any help will be very grateful.p  pstrongHere you can find a demo project with the joystickstrong a hrefhttpsmega.co.nzcp5FhYITdM88qxxQdyhED9fX4xeJ9ciQYJirUlNzEiKOzU2k

Negative 1720 pThe users on my website do operations like login, logout, update profile, change passwords etc. I am trying to come up with something that can store these user activities for my users and also return the matching records in case some system asks me for them based on userIds.p  pThe problem from what I can think of looks more write intensivesince users keep logging into the website very often and I have to record that. Once in a whilesay when users clicks on history or some reporting team needs it, the data records are read and returned.p  pSo my application is write intensivep  pThere are various approaches I can think of. Approach 1. The system that gets those user activities keeps on writing them into a queue and another one keep fetching from that queueperiodically or when it is filled completely and write them into databasewhich has been shardedassume based on hash of userId.p  pThe problem with this approach is if my activity manager runs on multiple nodes, it has to send those records to various shards which means a lot of data movement over network.p  pApproach 2The system that gets those user activities keeps on writing them into a queue and another one keep fetching from that queueperiodically or when it is filled completely and write them into read though write through cache which would take care of writing into the database. p  pProblem with this approach is I do not know If I can control as to where those records would be writtenI mean to which shard. Basically I do not know if the write through cache worksdoes it map to a local DB or it can manage to send data to shards.p  pApproach 3 The login operation is the most common user activity in my system. I can have a separate queue for login which must be periodically flushed to disk.p  pApproach 4 Use some cloud based storage which acts as a in memory queue where data coming from all nodes in stored. This would be reliable cache that guarantees no data loss. Periodically read from this cache and store that into the database shards.p  pThere are many problems to solve 1. Ensuring I do not loose the dataWhat kind of data replication to use i.e. any queue that ensures reliability 2. Ensuring my frequent writes do not result in performance 3. Avoid single point of failure. 4. Achieving infinite scalep  pI need suggestion based on above from the existing solution available. p

Negative 1720 pLets say I have a large Python library of functions and I want these functions or some large number of them to be available as commands in Bash.p  pFirst, disregarding Bash command options and arguments, how could I get a function of a Python file containing a number of functions to run using a single word Bash command I do not want to have the functions available via commands of a command suite. So, lets say I have a function called codezappocode in this Python file say, called codelibrary1.pycode. I would want to call this function using a singleword Bash command like codezappocode, emnotem something like codelibrary1 zappocode.p  pSecond, how could options and arguments be handled I was thinking that a nice way could be to capture all of the options and arguments of the Bash command and then use them within the Python functions using codedocoptcode parsing at the function level.p

Negative 1720 pI have a simple form with below functionalities.p  ol lipFirst Part It has a table which will display value from a database table, e.g. codetblProfilecode and it contains three columns like codeprofileid, profilename, descriptioncode and in each row an edit button to edit values. pli lipSecond Part In the same page, I have three text boxes to enter the value to the same database table, e.g. codetblProfilecode. After clicking on the submit button it will insert the value into the table and will immediately display it on the table mentioned above and based on the last codeprofileidcode it will show the top1 id in the codeprofileidcode textbox. If any edit button clicked on the table, these three text boxes will be populated with the values. After modification they have to be updated.pli ol  pI have created a view which uses codeIEnumerableltMyModelgtcode as model so that all the profile values are displayed in the table strongly typed view. Now for the form part I have created a partial view which is also a strongly typed view but instead of codeIEnumerableltMyModelgtcode it uses codeMyModelcode as its model type.p  pI amd confused about where I should put the Save, Update, Cancel etc. buttons in the main view or in the partial.

Negative 1720 h2Backgroundh2  pHere is what I understand about the object model relative to my question belowp  ul licodeselfcode always references the receiver in the current stack frame. li liWhen you are in the top level and you say codedef someMethodcode the implicit receiver is codeselfcode and you are creating a method which sits in the anonymous class associated with codeselfcode. This anonymous class happens to sit just under codeObjectcode codeselfcode is an instance of the codeObjectcode class so when you call codesomeMethodcode, Ruby takes a step to the right, and it lands in the anonymous class, thus finding and invoking your method. li liThis is similar to what goes on when you define methods inside of class definitions. If, when inside a class definition, you say codedef self.classMethodcode you are creating a method in an anonymous class that sits just underneath the codeClasscode class. Methods of this class, existing to the right of the class currently being defined will not be visible to instances of the new class. li ul  hr  h2My Questionh2  pstrongHow does defining a method in a class happen in the  first placestrong semanticallyp  pcodeClasscode objects arent supposed to be different from normal objects, rightp  pFrom what I understand about message handling, codeClasscode objects have a table as a part of their state, presumable meaning it is an instance variable, that has the names of all of its instance methods. This is how the method look up works. If Ruby doesnt find it , it goes up one and again, presumably the directions to the next link up the chain are a part of the state of the current codeClasscode object.p  pSince Ruby doesnt really care about object type, I presume it doesnt care that its looking in codeClasscode objects specifically when doing method look up. Rather, its just following references and looking for bits of state with certain names.  So, could I create my own class objects without using the class keyword that dont inherit from the codeClasscode classp  pIf that question doesnt make any sense, then I apologize. I just want to know strongwhat happens when the interpreter encounters the codedefcode keywordstrong.  p

Negative 1720 pI have a Web API which makes HTTP Requests to a windows service that executes certain taskscommands.p  pIf my service throws an exception I then want to pass that exception back up the pipe to the Web API using JSON.

Therefore if another device changed content of WELLKNOWNSEMADDR, waitForSemaphore wont necessarily know. So there must be something else make it work. p  pI have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18695120volatileandcachebehaviourthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7872175cvolatilevariablesandcachememoryrq1thisa, it seems volatile itself is not enough to guarantee such program works, there must be some platform dependent magic that either by passes L123 cache or force flush them, am I right If so are such support available on all popular platforms, for example x86p

The zoom is also fine, but it doesnt always fit the route. Sometimes the route is too big to fit, and other times the map should probably be zoomed in a little bit more. Is there any way to determine the zoom value that should be used based on the route Im fairly certain this is generally supposed to happen on its own, but that doesnt seem to be the case this time around.p  pOriginal post below.p  hr  pIve read a bunch of questionsanswers about this, but none of the provided answers seem to do what Im looking for. Ill try to explain this the best I can.p  pIm currently writing a store locator. On desktop, everything looks fine. Mobile is where I run into difficulty because of some changing views showinghiding divs. From what Ive read, it looks like a lot of people run into a problem where the map is created in a hidden div and then its displayed incorrectly e.g. the map only occupies the top left area of the container when the div is shown. p  pThe layout of the store locator is as follows  after you search for a location, you see a list view of all the results. When you click the map view tab up top, you see a Google maps view with all of the nearby stores on it. This works fine. If you select a store and click get directions from the list view, you see a list view of the directions to get to that store. Likewise, if you select a store and click get directions while in map view, you see a map of the directions. That works fine in both scenarios.p  pThe issue is when I am in a list view, click to get directions, and then switch over from the list view of directions to the map view. The map gets drawn with the correct route and it fills the div just like it should  however, the route is in the top left of the map, and the map itself is zoomed way out. For example, if the route is in the Philadelphia area, the map is so zoomed out that its center is generally around Bermuda. And its roughly the same spot in Bermuda every time.p  pHeres the relevant code for the button press between list and map views.p  precodedocument.onclick, .mobiletoggle a, function e      e.preventDefault      if this.hasClassactive          var target  this.attrdatatarget          results gt div, .mobiletoggle a.removeClassactive         this.addClassactive           target.addClassactive          google.maps.event.triggerdmap, resize  codepre  pcodedmapcode is a global variable containing the directions map, and the map itself has these two listeners assigned to it when it is created.p  precodegoogle.maps.event.addListenerdmap, idle, function       google.maps.event.triggerdmap, resize     dmapCenter  dmap.getCenter  google.maps.event.addDomListenerwindow, resize, function       dmap.setCenterdmapCenter  codepre  pThis redraws the map and makes sure the center stays the same while the window is resized, but the map itself still isnt focused on the route from location A to location B. I feel like the solution cant be too far from what Ive already tried based on what Ive read, but I cant seem to get this working.p  pSorry about the wall of text.

The problem is Im not sure where I can get a copy of the scikitlearn binaryexecutable that I need. I dont think its as straight forward as downloading the scikitlearn source and compiling myself because Ive heard scikitlearn has a lot of dependencies, and Im not sure which dependencies I need for the version I require. I was thinking I could create a Conda environment with the specific scikitlearn version I need so that Conda could do all the compiling for me, but Im not sure where Conda saves the libraries that it builds.

Negative 1720 pThe title may seem a little bit unclear, but Im going to tell you the whole story and hope to have your comments on it.  Im trying to detect some certain edges, especially those that occurs much more than the others, in a given image. To do this, the best idea is Fourier transform to map the discrete pixel domain into the frequency domain. Before applying the Fourier transform, I have to measure the mean of the distances of some desirable edges, and then use the Fourier transform to find the frequency of them. The problem is that how can I set the mean distance to the FFT algorithm on Python or Matlab. p  pThank youp
Negative 1720 pSo Im making a game in which the player will have a number of units with different job classes, say a Knight, Paige, Alchemist etc... Im currently making an inventory system and have run into a small problem with respect to code modularity and maintaining good code. Heres the layout of my code so farp  pI have an equip class, an instance for every weapon, and each equip has a type lets say shortsword and greatsword are types of equipment. Furthermore, a character of class Knight can equip greatsword and shortsword, but a character of type Paige can only equip shortswordsp  pJobs are organized using a Job class which each character owns using a List which is stored in character class. The Inventory class should access the character and get the Job and then request all items that the job can equip. p  pMy current prototype utilizes a string field in the Equip class called EquipType which will store these shortswordgreatsword strings. Job class will then have a List field which will be sent to Inventory class and get items using string matching. p  pHowever, this is annoying in terms of maintaining code since Im retyping strings for both Equip and Job classes, not very elegant. I was thinking of using enums since that will allow me to get items by enum type, but that will compromise modularity of code and couple things that maybe shouldnt be coupled  and global enums are bad practice anyway. In addition, the enum will then be quite big 1520 elements. p  pAre there cleaner and more elegant methods to such an inventory system p

But I see difference in the resultant list.p  pProbably, some one can explain, why it behaves so or how the nested bracket works in regular expressionp
Negative 1720 pProblem Recently I completed an import program for which the input is excel. To make the matter worse or good I assumed that every column of excel sheet will be of type string. In excel we have some field that has MPN and partnumber. Internally the partnumber is stored as xxxxxxxx, which looks same as UK Date format.  The excel has made these column as number and data, which I never asked it to do.  If I query this sheet using odbc then I get .0 appended with MPN and part number I get as datetime. To solve this problem I tried to paste the sheet in another blank sheet, I also tried to paste special Values, but I am not able to paste it in text format. I even tried to paste it in note pad, but doing so is converting numbers in scientific notation. My question How can I change the type to text, without converting it to values.p

Negative 1720 pIm trying to set up a ComboBox with its options binded from a list of strings, its default selected value binded from a setting, and with an event handler for its selection changed.p  pI want to configure it all using XAML like sop  precode    ltComboBox NameRoutesComboBox               ItemsSourceBinding Routes               SelectedItemBinding DefaultRoute                SelectionChangedRouteFilterSelectionChanged gt codepre  pBut when I do that on startup it throws the errorp  blockquote   pAn unhandled exception of type   System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException occurred in   PresentationFramework.dllp blockquote  pIf I only do some of it in XAML, then either set the codeSelectionChangedcode event or the codeItemsSourcecode programatically in C like below it works fine.
