My question is what is the correct architecture in this approach Should we have a BLL or Services layer to interact with this Petshop.Data or directly call ManagerFactory in our presentation layer Also should our presentation layer be unaware of Business Objects in our Petshop.Data and shoud we have Business Entities in BLL againp

Negative 14948 pIm looking to develop an app which features worksheets subclassed from DataGridView. Users can paste or import CSVlike data into the worksheet and it will be reflected in a data structure in memory  my first guess would be a 2D array of floats. p  pDataGridView can be bound to objects with a certain set of interfaces i.e. IList, IListSource etc. and so, in theory I could create a class which encapsulates a 2D array and implements one of these interfaces. However, what is puzzling is that the interface specs seem to only cater for 1 dimensional arrays  see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.ilist.aspx relnofollowILista for example. What is going onp  pbUpdateb From the answers, seems IList caters for lists of objects. Is there a way then to bind a multidimensional array of arbitrary size of floats to a DataGridView Or  is it ok to use the DataGridView itself as the data structure for storing the floatsp

Negative 14948 pI am a long time PHP user when it comes to web applications and am mostlz comfortable with it. However, I have a one semilarge project whose maintenance  extensibility has reached its end of a life cycle. I was weighing on different PHP frameworks there were no when the project originated, since it is the way to go for this project, and I came to conclusion the ebst option would be to do it with Zend Framework.p  ul liSymfony seemed to complicated I dont like setting up database model as thatli liCakePHP seemed murkyli liIgniter I liked at first, but then it seemed to me it is more like Zend with less features and no Zend behind itli liZend I like the system of that I can use only what I like and not being tied into a specific directory structure, and of course there is Zend behind it. Performance is what potentially bothers meli ul  pNow, after this little rationale behind choosing Zend, there are several things I see as a deal breaker when choosing a framework. p  ul liI havent used ORM in the past because I am more than comfortable writing SQL directly, so I still need to be convinced to use ORMli liNot too much abstraction going on from the gutsli liFlexible directory structureli ul  p As long as this project is going to be written anew, I just as might write it in PythonDjango, since I am quite familiar with Python, but not with Django. So, I would like to know if there is someone that worked with both Zend Framework and Django frameworks and if can outline a few key point differences p  p I must also say that this project is made as a standard siteadmin dual project. That is, it is basically two sites in one. One is for frontend and users, other is for data administration in the backend. I must and will build backend on my own, some scaffolding methods would be cool, but full automatic scaffolding is as good as nothing in this case. p  p  I am still quite not sure how one approaches building basically two applications within a directory structure of, what is supposed to be, one application. Do you just make two separate applications and rely on URL scheme from there on to separate them www.example.com and all of the  being one application and www.example.comadmin being a second application. p  p  Sorry for the long questions, but as you can see  everything is pretty much related to one problem  I need to start a project anew, it has already established databasedata which I can remodel, but would like to keep that kind of work at minimum. p  phrp  p Ok, thank you everybody  looks like Ill try and implement this stuff with Zend, gives me most flexibility out of the package I did tests with both, and well see how it goes. p

Negative 14948 pI have created a basic wcf service nothing more complicated than helloworld.

Negative 14948 pA common international issue is the conversion of double values represented in strings. This stuff is found in a lot of areas.p  pStarting with csv files which are either calledp  precodecomma separated codepre  porp  precodecharacter separated codepre  pbecause sometimes they are stored likep  precode1.2,3.4 5.6,6.4 codepre  pin English regions orp  precode1,23,4 5,66,4 codepre  pin for example German regions.p  pFrom this background, it is somehow necessary to know that most of the std methods are locale dependent. So in Germany, they will read 1,2 as 1.2 and write it back as 1,2 but with an English OS it will read 1,2 as 1 and write it back as 1.p  pBecause the locale is a global state of the application, it is not a good idea to switch it to a different setting and here we are with some problems when I have to read a German CSV file on an English machine or vice versa.p  pIts also hard to write code that behaves the same on all machines. The C stream allows a locale setting per stream.p  precodeclass Punctation  public numpunctltwchartgt  public    typedef wchart chartype   typedef stdwstring stringtype    explicit Punctationconst wchartamp decimalPoint, stdsizet r  0       decimalPointdecimalPoint, numpunctltwchartgtr          Punctationconst Punctationamp rhs       decimalPointrhs.decimalPoint         protected    virtual Punctation           virtual wchart dodecimalpoint const          return decimalPoint      private    Punctationamp operatorconst Punctationamp rhs    const wchart decimalPoint   ...  stdlocale newlocstdlocaleclassic, new PunctationL, stream.imbuenewloc codepre  pwill allow you to initialize a stream with std C behavior and only replace the decimal point. This gives me the ability to ignore the thousand separator, which may come into affect too. German 1000.12 may become 1.000,12 or in English 1,000.12 will end up in complete confusion. Even replacing , by . will not help in this situation.p  pIf I have to work with codeatofcode and friends I can usep  precodeconst char decimalpoint  localeconvgtdecimalpoint codepre  pto pimp my behavior.p  pSo there is an awful amount of stuff just for international double behavior. Even my Visual Studio runs into problems because the German version wants to write 8,0 as version into the vcproj file while an English version wants to change it to 8.0, which definitively happened by incident because in XML it is defined to be 8.0 in all countries of the world.p  pSo I just wanted to describe the problem a bit to ask for aspects I may have ignored.

The solution I came up with is to simply wrap my WCF service method in a switch statement so that I could call the UpdateCacheEntryItem method with the correct type of T. Since there is no way to convert from Type to the generic T operator, this is the only option. Since I dont have that many types in Cache, this works pretty well.

Negative 14948 pLooking to start a project that would require me to use Flash or Flex I have not worked with either of these yet, yikes.

Negative 14948 pHey guys, I was playing around with storyboards, a flipping animation, and visual brushes.  I have encountered an issue though.  Below is the xaml and codebehind of a small sample I quickly put together to try to demonstrate the problem.p  pWhen you first start the app, you are presented with a red square and two buttons.  If you click the Flip button, the red square will flip over and a blue one will appear.  In reality, all that is happening is that the scale of the width of the StackPanel that the red square is in is being decreased until it reaches zero and then the StackPanel where a blue square is, whose width is initially scaled to zero, has its width increased.  If you click the Flip button a few times, the animation looks ok and smooth.p  pNow, if you hit the Reflection button, a reflection of the redblue buttons is added to their respective StackPanels.  Hitting the Flip button now will still cause the flip animation but it is no longer a smooth animation.  The StackPanels width often does not shrink to zero.  The width shrinks somewhat but then just stops before being completely invisible. Then the other StackPanel appears as usual.  The only thing that changed was adding the reflection, which is just a VisualBrush.p  pBelow is the code.  Does anyone have any idea why the animations are different between the two cases stalling in the second casep  pThanks.p  precodeltWindow  xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation

try to find out what is causing the issue I am seeing and I believe I found what is causing the issue.  p  pBelow I have pasted new xaml and codebehind.  The new sample below is very similar to the original sample, with a few minor modifications.  The xaml basically consists of two stack panels, each containing two borders.  The second border in each stack panel is a visual brush a reflection of the border above it.  Now, when I click the Flip button, one stack panel gets its ScaleX reduced to zero, while the second stack panel, whose initial ScaleX is zero, gets its ScaleX increased to 1.  This animation gives the illusion of flipping.  There are also two textblocks which display the scale factor of each stack panel.  I added those to try to diagnose my issue.p  pThe issue is as described in the oringal post that the flipping animation is not smooth.  Every time I hit the flip button, the animation starts but whenever the ScaleX factor gets to around .14 to .16, the animation looks like it stalls and the stack panels never have there ScaleX reduced to zero, so they never totally disappear.  Now, the strange thing is that if I change the WidthHeight properties of the frontBorder and backBorder borders defined below to use explict values instead of Auto, such as Width105 and Height75 to match the button in the border everything works fine.  The animation stutters the first two or three times I run it but after that the flips are smooth and flawless.  BTW, when an animation is run for the first time, is there something going on in the background, some sort of initialization, that causes it to be a little slow the first timep  pIs it possible that the Auto WidthHeight of the borders are causing the issue  I can reproduce it everytime but I am not sure why Auto WidthHeight would be a problem.p  pBelow is the sample.

Negative 14948 pI would like to allow users to call my ruby on rails app as a service which returns a div with html content in it, and embed that div into their app which will not be a rails application.  p  pFor example, assume someone has their own php website that has a headerfooter template that gets rendered, and a content area of the page that they need to fill based on some html I generate in my rails app.  I would like to allow them, from php, to call to my website, get the div I generate, and embed that as html in their php page.p  pWhat Im trying to do is host a service on my site that returns some html content, but actually show that content as part of another site, so that the end user only sees the other site and never really knows about mine.p  pAlso, I can use javascript on the client to do this if that is the only way, but I would prefer the php app to handle this at the server if possible so the client gets the html embedded from the original server and it looks like it all was generated by the php script that generated the entire page.

Negative 14948 pI want an adaptable database scheme. But still use a simple table data gateway in my application, where I just pass an data[] array for storing.br The basic columns are settled in the initial table scheme. There will however arise a couple of meta fields later ca 1020. I want some flexibility there and not adapt the database manually each time, or worse change the application logic just because of new fields.br So now there are two options which seem workable yet not overkill. But Im not sure about the scalability or database drawbacks.p  pstrong1 Automatic ALTER TABLE.strong Whenever the data array is to be saved, the keys are compared against the current database columns. New columns get defined before the data is INSERTed into the table. Actually seems simple enough in test codep  precodefunction savedata, tableforum      columns    if newfields  arraydiffarraykeysdata, knownfieldstable        extendschematable, newfields, data         save    columns  implode, , arraykeysdata    qm  strrepeat,, countarraykeysdata  1    echo INSERT INTO table columns VALUES qm  function knownfieldstable     return unserializefilegetcontentsdbtable  arrayid  function extendschematable, newfields, data     foreach newfields as field         echoALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN field VARCHAR codepre  pSince it is mostly meta information fields, adding them just as VARCHAR seems sufficient. Nobody will query by them anyway. So the database is really just used as storage here.br However, while I might want to add a lot of new data fields on the go, they will not always be populated.p  pstrong2 serialize fields into BLOB.strong Any newextraneous meta fields could be opaque to the database. Simply sorting out the virtual fields from the real database columns is simple. And the meta fields can just be serialized into a blobtext field thenp  precodefunction extsavedata, tableforum       dbfields  arrayid, content, flags, ext     disjoin    foreach arraydiffarraykeysdata,dbfields as key        data[ext][key]  data[key]       unsetdata[key]        data[ext]  serializedata[ext] codepre  pUnserializing and unpacking this ext column on read queries is a minor overhead. The advantage is that there wont be any sparsely filled columns in the database, so I guess its compacter and faster than the AUTO ALTER TABLE approach.br Of course, this method prevents ever using one of the new fields in a WHERE or GROUP BY clause. But I think none of the possible meta fields useragent, authorip, authorimg, votes, hits, lastmodified, .. wouldshould ever be used there anyway.p  pSo I currently prefer the ext blob approach, even if its a oneway ticket.br How are such columns called usually looking for examplesdocbr Would you use XML serialization for emveryem theoretical indatabase queriesp  pThe adapting table scheme seems a cleaner interface, even if most columns might remain empty then. How does that impact speed How many such sparse VARCHAR fields can MySQLinnodb stomachbr But most importantly Is there any standard implementation for this A pseudo ORM with emautomaticem ALTER TABLE tricks Storing a simple column list seems workable, but something like pdogetColumnMeta would be more robust.p

Does that make sensep  pAnyway, has anyone come across a plugin to help me build such a slide jQuery Ajax CSS Not sure how to go about it. Has anyone any experience or ideas with what Im trying to achievep  pLet me know what you think, and if you need me to elaborate on anything p  pThanks, Davidp

Can they contain any binary files  Or are they always for the user to do a codebundle install localcode, and they all contain only text files, so they will generate the appropriate binary files, if any, on the gem directory, so whether adding this folder to the project is optional, although if we run codebundle packagecode to generate this folder, the intention is probably so that everybody create the gems using this folder instead of pulling it from rubygems.orgp

Negative 14948 pMy Android app works by using a SQLite database that is generated on the users PC and transferred to the device. It all works, but I had not anticipated the number of users who would have really huge amounts of data. In these cases, the UI is very sluggish as it waits for the data to be fetched.p  pIve tried a number of tricks that I was sure would speed things up, but nothing seems to have any noticeable effect. My queries are almost all very simple, being usually a single colval for the WHERE clause, and INTEGER data in the column.  So I cant do much with the queries.p  pThe latest, and I am not an SQL expert by any means, was to use CREATE INDEX commands on the PC, believing that these indexes are used to speed up database searches. The indexes increased the size of the database file significantly, so I was then surprised that it seemed to have no effect whatsoever on the speed of my app A screen that was taking 8 seconds to fill without indexes still takes about 8 seconds even with them. I was hoping to get things down to at least half that.p  pWhat I am wondering at this point is if the SQLite implementation on Android uses database indexes at all, or if Im just wasting space by generating them. Can anyone answer thisp  pAlso, any other things to try to speed up accessp  pFor what its worth, on an absolute basis the users have nothing to complain about.

Negative 14948 pI am new to programing so any help is appreciated. I am trying to find the method for the following. I need one button that will, when executed, perform a different task in a sequence when activated. For example the first time that the button is pressed, I would like it to act as if the user is confirming the information in the title of the button i.e. confirms that the user is older than 45.  The second time that the user presses the button it confirms the response in the negative i.e. confirms the user is NOT older than 45.  The third time the user presses the button the field is reset and no value has been assigned i.e. it is as if the user never answered the question. p  pFor realestate purposes I would like the information in question to be the title of the button and update appropriately once the action has been captured. For example, if the action is positive the display is shown with a circle around the title. If the action results in a negative response, the title is shown with a line through it.  p  pI have done quite a bit or reading to try to get a solution but no dice so far.

Negative 14948 pI have an application in ASP.NET that uses forms authentication. It has the following code.p  precodeif User.Identity.IsAuthenticated         ViewStateUserKey  User.Identity.Name codepre  pStepping through I see this code executes on each page load.

If you let the page sit till forms auth times out, the user is no longer logged in, and a post back fails on validation of the viewstate because the name is now null. However I have noticed if I put other buttons on the screen, and the post back, it doesnt fail, even after authentication has timed out. Should this error every time it times outp

There are several known caveats with this that should be noted. These arep      ul   liIt doesnt work consistently nor reliably crossbrowserli   liIt doesnt fire correctly in WebKit if the image src is set to the same src as beforeli   liIt doesnt correctly bubble up the DOM treeli   liCan cease to fire for images that already live in the browsers cacheli   ul blockquote  pA couple of those items sound a little vague to me, but these images were appended into an element using the get method, so my best guess is that my problem has something to do with that.p  pThis doesnt seem like an unusual circumstance, but Google isnt giving me anything. Has anybody here encountered thisp
Negative 14948 pBasically Ive got two sockets that Id like to run in parallel, so I dont have to wait for one socket to send data to receive data from the other etc. I can do this easily by forking, but, to be tidier, Id like to know if there is a way to do it from the same process.p  pSomething likep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include lttime.hgt void test          sleep5000  int mainint argc, char argv[]    printfdn,timeNULL   test   printfdn,timeNULL   systemPAUSE   return 0   codepre  pBut both lines of output would be the same, as the sleep function is being processed somewhere else.p  pI found an MSDN document about creating threads, but it talked about Clibrary functions not being safe for it, which worried me, I like my stdlibp  pSo, yeah, if you have any examples, you can just use sleep as a placeholder, Im pretty good with sockets  Im on Windows, but a Unix version would be nice as well, or better yet, one that works with both.p  pEDIT Thanks for all your responses. I think I see what you mean I have my two sockets, then I call select, it returns all the sockets that are ready to receivesend data, I sendreceive my data, then loop back. However, how could I implement this with accept, as the socket hasnt yet been createdp

Negative 14948 pOne requirement in our application is to implement dual control for everything, including CRUD operations.  Just to be clear, dual control is a feature that requires a change in the data to be approved by someone other than the change requestor. So when a user make changes to data, its not directly committed to production tables. Im aware of several ways to implement this e.g. staging tables but thats for other time.p  pThe question, with such requirement, do you think we should follow the standard data centric way of generated Roo  GWT which uses RequestFactory p  pOr well better off implementing our own command pattern based framework to support dual controlp  pIm inclined toward the latter. My intuition which based on 3 days playaround with RooGWT says that RequestFactory is not designed with dual control in mind, and well hit a wall if we try to force our way in. Would be more than happy to be proven wrong here.p

Negative 14948 pHere is a muchsimplified example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netguardMmcEY3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netguardMmcEY3a The body width is artificially rejected here, though its not the case for the real app  see below.p  pThere are multiple blocks laid out similar to d1 and d2. All of them having minwidth set. Theres also a stripe at the bottom of the screen that must fill the whole width.p  pOn a wide screen everything works fine  theres enough of body width for blocks to fit, no scrolling and the stripe fills the whole screen width.p  pBut on a narrow screen emulated in the example with the body width explicitly set the following happens the contents width is actually more than the bodys width. This content make the horizontal scrolling appear, though it doesnt stretch the body. So, the stripe the green line at the bottom occupies less space than the page content.p  pp  pWell, great, guys, I know its because of margin .p  pAs I said, fixed body width is set here for demonstration only, in the real world the body width is defined by the window size.

Negative 14948 pI tried searching this over the net but in vain. Is there a way to use hibernate to perform an idempotent update.  p One use case is to use HTTP PUT to update a specific field in the database via a REST API. So for example, if I have a database with columns  ibId, Name, Phone, UpdateDatebi and I update the bPhoneb field of a specific bIdb with the same value multiple times only my first action must update the bPhoneband also change my bUpdateDateb. Subsequent updates must have no effect on the record and bUpdateDateb. p While this can be implemented in an application by first getting the record and comparing it against my input value before performing an update. I was wondering whether Hibernate has any inbuilt featuresp

Negative 14948 pMy flex application has a very bad load time approx 5 to 8 wasted seconds but only for FF and IE, Chrome appears fine.p  pIve determined there is some kind of useless idle time before the applications initalization event fires.  This is not just my development box, it happens everywhere.   It is consistent across Flash version, OS and browser versions too.  Ive tried multiple.   Chrome consistenly works very fast, IE and FF have this strange lag.p  pHowever locally, whether via localhost or remote IP, it doesnt have this issue.  Im sure youll think it is the download time, but my SWF is very small 400K and Ive purposely made external images that are very small.   I also prefetch the images via JavaScript, and firebug reports the the cache is used later.  The download size cant really justify the wait time.  Not to mention, why is it so much faster in chrome  Is chrome really that fast downloading images and SWF filesp  pAlso, minimal JavaScript is called from Flex, and Ive more or less ruled out that is the issue.  So it isnt Chromes super fast handling of JavaScript.p  pI dont see any large load times with Firebug.   I see JavaScript excute in the browser inline during a page load, but then the appliation init within the SWF doesnt fire for about 5 to 8 seconds later.p  pI dont see why flash on Chrome is so much faster, nor what could be taking so long for Flash to kick in.p  pEDIT Tried the Flex Profiler, but memory usage spikes AFTER the bad load time.  Otherwise, I dont know enough or see enough to recognize a problem with it.p

Negative 14948 pIm designing a RESTful web service, and trying to come up with a good way to handle caching and synchronization of collections of items.  Ive read about the use of Etag and IfNoneMatch headers for optimizing the caching of individual resources, and Im wondering if they can be or should be used for collections.p  pIm interested in your feedback on the following approachp  ol liA collection of items is exposed at the URI a hrefhttpfoobar.comitems relnofollowhttpfoobar.comitemsali liA client making an initial GET request on that URI will not include an IfNoneMatch   header.  In this case, the server returns all of the items or some amount at the servers discretion, say, the most recent N items.  The response contains an Etag header indicating a tick stamp that represents the the current pseudotime of the servers pseudoclock e.g. some counter that increases each time there is a change to the data.  li liThe client caches the returned items. li liOn subsequent GET requests, the client includes the previously received Etag value in its IfNoneMatch header. The server checks to see if it has any items newer than the    IfNoneMatch header, and if so, returns ONLY the newer items. Otherwise, it returns a 304 status not modified and no items.li ol  pQuestion  am I subverting the semantic meaning of a GET by only returning the newer items in 4, rather than the whole collection which would include items already cached on the client  Or does this seem like a reasonable approach  Can you suggest alternative approaches that would be betterp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 14948 pWith this C codep  precodeint a  timeNULL daylight  0 timezone  0 int b  timeNULL asserta  b codepre  pa and b will have different values and not just because they are called a few milliseconds apart.  The difference will be whatever the offset of your PCs timezone is from UTC time.  Also, changing the daylight and timezone values effect pretty much every other function I might use in my C app  I assume because they all respect that value.p  pIs there anything like that in Java, or specifically for Java on Android OS  I tried TimeZone.setDefault, but that didnt change the value that System.currentTimeMillis returned, so I assume it isnt going to have a global effect like the C variables.p  pI understand that System.currentTimeMillis is different than time, in that it always returns the number of millis since now and epoch, and the time function allows you to get false fudged values that are adjusted according to these global variables you can set.p  pJust trying to emulate a legacy C app on Android OS.  It clears those timezone and daylight values which pretty much means it ignores any timezones.  So if a user running the app on the west coast enters a time of 3pm, and then they change their timezone settings, or a user on the est coast views that item, it will still show as 3pm.p  pI know I can use the Calendar object and other methods to make sure I do the proper conversions, but Id rather just have an easy I dont care about timezones settings like I did in the C app and then truely not have to worry about them.p  pEdit I would still like to hear what other options I have, but for now I came up with this Java code that Ill do my best to always use for any code that needs to mimic the C appp  precode IMPORTANT Use this function everywhere a Calendar object is needed, instead of calling   Calendar.getInstance directly.  This returns the correct kludged time that matches   what our PC application uses daylight0, timezone0, timeNULL in C public static Calendar GetCalendarInstance       Get the current UTC time     Calendar cal  Calendar.getInstanceTimeZone.getTimeZoneUTC       Offset it by the system time zone offset.       This mimics what the C timeNULL function does when you set timezone0 and daylight0     cal.addCalendar.MILLISECOND, TimeZone.getDefault.getOffsetcal.getTimeInMillis      returncal  codepre  pAlso, I did already find one place in my Android app that I need the real, not adjusted, system time when using AlarmManager to schedule a PendingIntent.  So I guess global could be dangerous either way.  I still think 95 of my code will be using the version that mimics the C app though, so if possible Id like to default to that and then only have to do special handling for the other few places.p

Negative 14948 pIm trying to convert a project that is currently using a custom DAO framework to using Entity Framework. The system is quite large so changes to the database a SQL Azure DB if that matters itself arent particularly feasible and should be avoided if possible.p  pThe problem is with the ID column. Unfortunately when the system was created, there are some tables that have a codebigintcode datatype, and some that have an codeintcode  but the models themselves all come from a base class having a codelongcode for the ID. The previous framework was able to handle this situation, but I have been unable to find a way to do it with entity framework.p  pBelow is the most trivial example I can think ofp  precodepublic class Context  DbContext      public IDbSetltFoogt Foos getset     public IDbSetltBargt Bars getset  public abstract class BaseClass      public long ID  public class Foo  BaseClass      ...  public class Bar  BaseClass      ...  SQL Table Foo   id  bigint   ...           SQL Table  Bar   id  int      ...           codepre  pWhen I try to load a codeBarcode model, I get this errorp  precodeThe ID property on BaseClass could not be set to a Int32 value. You must set this property to a nonnull value of type Int64. codepre  pId like to find a way to tell the system that Bar has ints, while Foo has longs. Ive tried overriding codeOnModelCreatingcode in the context and defining codeHasColumnTypecode for codeBarcode. That gave me a new errorp  precodeSchema specified is not valid. Errors     105,12  error 2019 Member Mapping specified is not valid. The type Edm.Int64[NullableFalse,DefaultValue] of member ID in type Bar is not compatible with SqlServer.int[NullableFalse,DefaultValue,StoreGeneratedPatternIdentity] of member ID in type CodeFirstDatabaseSchema.Bar. codepre  pIt seems to me that if I could only change the expected data type for the codeIDcode of codeBaseClasscode to codeintcode before sending the request to the server, then I should be able to upconvert to a codelongcode after I receive the response. Ideally, Id like to do this on a perclass basis.p  pCan anyone point me in the right directionp

Negative 14948 pIn my Android application, I have a fairly linear process of about 5 Activities. With the current implementation, I simply build up a stack of the activities. In other words, the flow is something like the followingp  pHome  Screen 1  Screen 2  Screen 3  Screen 4  Screen 5p  pAfter Screen 5, I want to go back to Screen 1. I currently do this by using codeActivity.setResultcode, and checking for the result in codeonActivityResultcode. If the result is set, I immediately finish the Activity.p  pThis works fine, unless I enable the Dont keep activities developer option on my phone on ICS. In that case, the user can briefly see each activity popping up before it is finished again.p  pIs there a way to avoid all the Activities popping up when removing them from the stack Is there a better way to achieve what Im doing Should I just ignore this behavior, and assume users wont ever see this on real devicesp  pNote that I cant use something like codeFLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOPcode and launch Screen 1 directly from Screen 5, since Screen 5 does not know at which Activity it should stop for reasons I wont go into in this post.p

The .so is made up of several classes, and is in generic C, not JNI.p  pIs there a way to call the C functions from the Android Java app, other than JNI Everything Ive seen about JNI suggests that you have to rewrite the native code to be JNIspecific, and that is really damn inconvenient if youre only given a .so.p  pWhat alternative methods exist for calling native functions from a java application in Android 4.0.3 How simple would it be to write a small JNIC program that calls the C functions, and can then be called from Java p  pIs there anything in Eclipse that will simplify the processp  pI probably shouldnt be surprised that there isnt a more elegant solution.p

Negative 14948 pIm trying to develop a Java3D method for rotating the universe in increments from the current viewing direction to the direction at the center of an object.p  pIn other words, I want the 3D universe to rotate in, say, 100 short steps, so that an object that I click on appears to move gradually to the center of the screen.p  pIve reviewed the various answers to 3D rotation questions here on StackOverflow as well as on the Web, but pretty much all of them are specific to rotating objects, not the world itself.p  pIve also tried to review my linear algebra, but thats not helping me to identify Javaspecific functions that accomplish my requirements.p  pSo far Ive tried defining a set of incremental XYZ coordinates and dynamically using lookAt in each pass through the loop. That almost works, but I dont see any way to preserve or obtain viewpoint values from one complete rotation pass to the next each rotation pass starts out looking at the origin.p  pIve also tried defining a rotation matrix by obtaining the difference between the target and start transforms and dividing by the number of increments and removing the scaling value, then adding that incremental rotation matrix to the current view direction at each pass through the loop. That works just fine for an increment value of 1. But splitting the rotation into two or more increments always generates the BadTransformException Noncongruent transform above ViewPlatform error. Ive read the meager documentation of this exception in the Java3D API reference it might as well have been written in Urdu for all I could make out from it. There seems to be no plainEnglish definition of 3Dcontext terms like affine or shear or congruent or uniform anywhere that Google can see.p  pI then tried to cudgel my code into providing an AxisAngle4d, obtaining the angle in radians, dividing that angle into my desired increments, and rotating by the incremental angle value. That rotated the world, all right, but nowhere near the object I picked, and not to any pattern I could see.p  pIn desperation I tried using rotX and rotY setting Z to the endpoint on the extracted angle, and even blindly threw a couple of Math.cos and Math.sin wrappers in there. Still no joy.p  pMy instincts are telling me that Ive got the basics in place and that theres a relatively simple solution in Java3D. But clearly theres a comprehension wall Im hitting. Rather than continue that, I thought Id go ahead and see if anyone here can suggest a solution in Java3D. Code is preferred, but Im willing to try to follow an explanation in linear algebra if that will get me to a code solution.p  pBelow is the core of the method Im using to schedule rotation increments using Javas Timer method. The part I need help with is just before the ActionListener.

Im open to constructive suggestions there as well.p  pThanks very much for any assistance with thisp  hr  pUPDATEp  pLet me try to define the goal a little more concretely.p  pI have a Java3D universe containing many Sphere objects. I can click on each object and dynamically obtain its predefined XYZ coordinates.p  pAt any moment, I am looking at all currently visible objects with a camera at a particular XYZ position and a view direction, which are contained in a transform holding the rotation matrix and translation vector.p  pNote I can both rotate the universe and translate through it using the mouse independently of clicking on objects. So there will be times when the view transform containing the cameras current rotation matrix and translation vector is not pointing at any target object with known XYZ coordinates.p  pGiven the camera transform and the objects XYZ coordinates, I want to rotate the universe around my current camera position until the selected object is centered in the screen. And I want to do this as a sequence of discrete incremental rotations, each of which is rendered so that the visible universe appears to spin in the viewing window until the selected object is centered. Im following this up with a translation to the object that part at least is workingp  pExample Suppose the camera is at the origin, up is 1.0 along the Yaxis, and the selected object is centered ten units directly to my left. Assuming I had a 180degree field of view, I could click on the half of the sphere that is visible all the way to the left of the screen and halfway between the top and bottom of the screen.p  pWhen I give the word, every visible object in the universe should appear to move in a sequence of evenlyspaced steps lets say 50 from my left to my right until the selected object is exactly centered in the screen.p  pIn coding terms, I need to work out the Java3D code by which I can rotate the universe around an imaginary line that runs through my camera position currently at 0,0,0 and that is perfectly aligned with the Yaxis of the universes coordinate system. I.e., the axis of rotation sweeps through a plane where Z is always equal to the Z component of the cameras position.p  pThe complicating requirements arep  ol liThe camera can be translated somewhere in 3D space other than the origin.li liObjects can be anywhere in 3D space with respect to the cameras current position and view, including being visible but off the screen outside the view frustum entirely.li liRotations should take the shortest path  no spinning the universe more than 180 degrees at a time.li liThere should not be any jump or twisting of the visible universe as the first step in the rotation process i.e., the current up vector not the universes absolute up vector should be preserved.li ol  pSo theres the question given a transform holding the virtual cameras current translation and rotation information, and the XYZ coordinates in universe space of a target object, what Java3D code will rotate the universe around the camera in N equal steps until the object is centered in the screenp  pPresumably this solution is in two parts first, some 3D math expressed in Java3D to calculate the incremental rotation information given only the camera transform and objects XYZ coordinates second, a loop that [applies the incremental rotation to the current viewing transform and updates the screen] until the loop counter equals the number of increments.p  pIts that 3D math part thats beating me. Im not seeing and cant bash out a way to obtain some form of incremental rotation information from the current camera transform and target object position that I can then apply to the camera transform. At least, I havent found any way that doesnt cause jumping or twisting or unequal incremental movement steps or a noncongruent transform above ViewPlatform exception.p  pThere must be a simple solution....p

Negative 14948 pIm using Visual Studio to develop a C program that uses OCCI to query an Oracle 11g database. Its a pretty simple program at this point, and only makes a single query, but I keep running into runtime errors. I first tried to develop this in VS2010, downloading the 11.2.0.3 OCCI files, and I got an error related to the entry point for a heapalloc procedure not located in oci.dll. I get the impression this error might be due to the fact that my Oracle client is 11.2.0.1. p  pSince Im unable for support reasons to upgrade my client to a higher version, I decided to fall back to using Visual Studio 2005, since I read in Oracles OCCI documentation that the vc8 versions of OCCI libs and DLLs come installed already in the 11g client. So I moved my COCCI program over to VS 2005 and now I get a different debug runtime error An error message box saying The application failed to initialize properly, and a message from the loader in the VS Output window saying ldrpWalkImportDescriptor failed to probe [ORACLE CLIENT DIR]ocilibmsvcvc8oraocci11d.dll for its manifest, ntstatus 0xc0150002 I dont see a manifest file for the oraocci11d.dll, so Im at a loss for how to resolve this. Can anyone more versed in VS setup for OCCI make a suggestion Thanks in advance...p  pSheldonp

Negative 14948 ptheory really.p  pIm going to be developing a speech algorithm and somehow have to build a HMM Hidden Markov Model now I get the basic idea of one.. That it is used for probability, and this can be used in Speech recognition. Ok so I found this quote from a websitep  pA HMM is constructed for each word in the vocabulary, and then the string of phones is compared against each HMM, to determine which model is the most likely match.p  pNow I kind of get this, but, what I do not understand is.. For a HMM to be implemented, do I need to take each word in the vocabulary i.e. in the english dictionary and its frequency and then take the frequencies of the Phones The HMM would find the most accurate word for the Phonep  pI hope someone can answer this,p  pThanks p

Negative 14948 pIm doing a project with font icons for css3 and two separate approaches to mapping characters have come to light.p  ol liIcons are mapped to common characters, including alphanumeric characters and other keyboardbased characters.li liIcons are mapped into the Private User Area of unicode UE000..UF8FFli ol  pAll the things being equal, Id do things the first way. Css3 content is presentation only, and, in good practice, shouldnt be used to convey meaning, and it is far more user friendly. Users, in this context, being frontend developers who would otherwise need to deal with hex codes in their stylesheets, who can instead use keyboard characters.p  pOne argument Ive seen for using the private user area is to ensure that the cssdefined content is not read out by screen readers. That sounds reasonable, but I cant think of a reason why a screen reader would do such a thing. The before and after pseudoelements which the content property is used with are, by definition, not part of the DOM.p  pIve come across this video which shows that my assumptions are correct in three cases a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvBmMrOfsXXEU relnofollowYoutube video submitted by Dan Tamas, testing screenreaders with the css content propertyap  pAre there any examples of a screenreader that bugs out and starts reading out css content to users Could that even happenp

Negative 14948 pI want to create a threadsafe collection that can be modified while being enumerated.p  pThe sample codeActionSetcode class stores codeActioncode handlers. It has the codeAddcode method that adds a new handler to the list and the codeInvokecode method that enumerates and invokes all of the collected action handlers. The intended working scenarios include very frequent enumerations with occasional modifications while enumerating.p  pNormal collections throw exception if you modify them using the codeAddcode method while the enumeration is not over.p  pThere is an easy, but slow solution to the problem Just clone the collection before enumerationp  precodeclass ThreadSafeSlowActionSet      ListltActiongt actions  new ListltActiongt      public void AddAction action          lockactions              actions.Addaction                    public void Invoke          lockactions              ListltActiongt actionsClone  actions.ToList                  foreach var action in actionsClone               action                codepre  pThe problem with this solution is the enumeration overhead and I want enumeration to be very fast.p  pIve created a rather fast recursionsafe collection that allows adding new values even while enumerating. If you add new values while the main codeactionscode collection is being enumerated, the values are added to the temporary codedeltacode collection instead of the main one. After all enumerations are finished, the codedeltacode values are added to the codeactionscode collection. If you add some new values while the main codeactionscode collection is being enumerated creating the codedeltacode collection and then reenter the Invoke method again we have to create a new merged collection codeactionscode  codedeltacode and replace codeactionscode with it.p  pSo, this collection looks recursionsafe, but I want to make it threadsafe.

Negative 14948 pSo here is my quandaryp  pIve been asked to build a mobile app that works just as an existing web application works. The web application uses FB login to authenticate users and I need to do the same in iosAndroid. The simplest solution is to use a webview and simply view the web app within the native application. This works well until a users logs in with FB. The FB login window pops up and one can log in, but the redirect to the url fails and just a white screen is shown.p  pMy research points me to an issue with the FBSessionDelegate, but Im not sure if that is the issue. p  pIdeally, Id like to use the sample Hackbook FB app and just have it redirect users to the web app after logging in, but Im a little lost on the authentication path between the two.p  pAny ideas or assistance is greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Consider the following example.p  precodepackage main  import      encodingbinary     fmt   func main      array  []byte0x00, 0x01, 0x08, 0x00, 0x08, 0x01, 0xab, 0x01     num,   binary.Uvarintarray[08]     fmt.Printfv, xn, array, num  codepre  pstronga hrefhttpplay.golang.orgpq0lCVvTfRDHere it is on play.golang.org.astrongp  pWhen that is run, it displays the codenumcode as code0code, even though, in hex, it should be code000108000801ab01code. Furthermore, if one catches the second value from codebinary.Uvarintcode, it is the number of bytes read from the buffer, which, to my knowledge, should be 8, even though it is actually 1.p  pAm I interpreting this wrong If so, what should I be using insteadp  pThanks, you all. p

Negative 14948 pMy Database has a Table Foo with the Property IsTrue. I made a Linq2SQL Class myData.dbml for this Database and added the generated FooClass to my Datasources bar. I have a Simple Winforms Window with a ToggleButton which should bind to the inverse of IsTrue.p  pTo achieve this I tried to add the Property NotTrue to the myData.dbml but this caused an SQLException, invalid row name NotTrue. I tried to add the Property Code to the myData.cs like thisp  precodepublic bool NotTrue      get          return this.IsTrue          set          if this.IsTrue  value              this.OnIsTrueChangingvalue             this.SendPropertyChanging             this.IsTrue  value             this.SendPropertyChangedIsTrue             this.SendPropertyChangedNotTrue             this.OnIsTrueChanged                codepre  pBut then the Property didnt appear when adding Foo to Datasources even when adding code[Bindabletrue]codep  pWhat worked, was binding to IsTrue and negating the Binding with thisp  precodeprivate void InvertBoolBindingControlBindingsCollection collection,string property      foreach Binding b in collection          if b.PropertyName.Equalsproperty              ConvertEventHandler invert  new ConvertEventHandlersender, e gt  e.Value  boole.Value              b.Format  invert             b.Parse  invert                codepre  pCalled like thisp  precodeInvertBoolBindinglockToggleButton.DataBindings, IsChecked codepre  pThough in my main project theres a huge amount of those Bindings, this approach is quite a hassle. It seems that Datasources isnt able to connect properties through partial classes. When I add the property to the myData.designer.cs, it is found. But this class get regularly regenerated and my property gets lost.p  pSo maybe I need a completely different approach or maybe theres a way to make partial class extensions work. I hope you got some idea on that. Thanksp

Negative 14948 pLets say you have a very long binaryword 64bit, which represents an unsigned integral value, and you would like to print the actual number. Were talking C, so lets assume you start off with a bbool[ ]b or bstdvectorltboolgtb or a bstdbitsetb, and end up with a bstdstringb or some kind of bstdostreamb  whatever your solution prefers. But please only use the corelanguage and STL.p  pNow, i suspected, you must evaluate it chunkwise, to have some intermediate results, that are small enough to store away  preferably base 10, as in xmiddot10supksup. I could figure out to assemble the number from that point. But since there is no chunkwidth that corresponds to the base of 10, I dont know how to do it. Of course, you can start with any other chunkwidth, lets say 3, to get intermediates in the form of xmiddot2sup3supsupksup, and then convert it to base 10, but this will lead to xmiddot10sup3middotkmiddotlg2sup which obviously has a floatingpoint exponent, that isnt of any help.  p  pAnyway, Im exhausted of this mathcrap and I would appreciate a thoughtful suggestion.  p  pYours sincerely,br Arminp

Negative 14948 pIm trying to put a simple app on windows store. I made a fail attempt once, I submitted an app which failed to pass WACK, eventually it failed on submission too. Even then, when I try to package an app with my developer account logged in, I get a performance launch error. p  pEven on a blank app. also right after I create package logged in, my apps package name and provider fields on appmanifest are changes too. apps package name changes to the first app I submitted, and the provider changes to I guess my developer accounts key.p  pI deleted my failed submission on dashboard, deleted all the names I reserved, including the failed one. But even when I reserve a new name and package my app with that name, my package name still changes to the very first one and fails on wack. p  pBUT, when I create package of my app WITHOUT logging in, I mean without associate with windows store, I can package my app with the name I want and pass the WACK. I hope anyone can help me with this.p  pEdit C application.p

Negative 14948 pIve been struggling with what seems like simple concepts, but I seem to keep combining and mixing up binary conversions.p  pIf you are given a number in binary and apply 1s complement, you invert all bits. Making the 0s 1s and 1s 0s. For 2s complement you invert the bits like with 1s complement and add 1.p  pDoes this mean you literally invert all bits For some reason I keep thinking that all bits should be inverted except for the left most bit the sign bit.

Negative 14948 pHello StackOverFlow experts,p  pI am very new to Android programming and unfortunately my first project in Android involves using C libraries. These are third party libraries and they have to be used. Also, I am not familiar with C. I have successfully installed Android SDK v4.2.2 and APIv 17 and NDK androidndkr8e. I was able to compile the C code and build the eclipse project and see the application running on my Android device.p  pBut today I learnt that I have to compile a C preprocessor directive to make some functionality work. As I understand C preprocessor directive is executed before the actual compilation of code. Now, thanks to google, I learnt that the way to execute the preprocessor directive is to modify the makeall.sh file and I did the followingp  precodeARCHarmeabi armeabiv7a mips x86 LIBDIR....mpcorelib.androidlibs  tmpdirmktemp d tmp0.XXXXX  for arch in ARCH do  UsersDesktopandroidndkr8endkbuild LOCALCPPFLAGSDUSEORIGINALBACKGROUND LOCALLDFLAGSLLIBDIRarch APPABIarch cp libsarchlibsample.so tmpdirlibsample.so.arch done  for arch in ARCH do  cp tmpdirlibsample.so.arch libsarchlibsample.so done  rm rf tmpdir codepre  pwhere USEORIGINALBACKGROUND is the name of my C directive.p  pWhen I run the makeall.sh it compiles well atleast I dont see any error. Then I open my eclipse project, refresh it and then build the APK file. But, unfortunately, I dont see the expected results.p  pSo my question to all Am I missing something The way I have modified my makeall.sh sounds correct to youp  pPardon me, if this question is very elementary to you all but it will really help me to learn and make progress learning Android. Thank you all in advancep
Negative 14948 pI am fully aware of codeMutationObservercode but what I need is differentp  pI would like to listen to an element which has been created in the memory, and that specific element can be appended anywhere thus I do not want to observe everything because it would be an overkill as things gets changed everywhere on the app, all the time.p  pThe listener would fire when the specific element has been inserted to the DOM. just a way to follow a single element instead of watching the whole DOM. its kinda backwards approach but I think it is the right way to go in my case. p  pHow can this be done thanksp

Negative 14948 pCurrently working on an MVC application, which has a registration form with some 1214 fields that the user will have to fill in in order to register to our site. There are two requirements about the user input, and those are, surprisingly, that he provides a unique email and a unique username, ones that still dont exist in our database. I already have tests about those validations, and the rest of the user input correctness is left to validation notations in the model, like the date format and the password strength requirements and so on, like this.p  precode[RequiredErrorMessage  Your password is required] [StringLength20, MinimumLength  8, ErrorMessage  Must be between 8 and 20                                                           characters] [RegularExpression.8,.d.[az].[AZ].s[09azAZamp], ErrorMessage  Needs to have lowercase, uppercase and a number] [DisplayName  Password] public string Password  get set  codepre  pWithout testing these notations, I guess the only test I need to write about this logic are those about validating username and email uniqueness and adding a record to the db, which I already have, but I fear that only 3 tests might be too little. Although I think and hope, honestly that I dont need tests for the outofthebox notation validations, I would like to hear that from someone more experienced and less lazy  Also, if you could point out some general rules about what else should be tested when a user is registering, it would be great. p

Negative 14948 pWe start with an activity that starts a service then becomes idle until the service calls the activity again. the activity goes to onPausei believe and isnt started back up until the its  BroadcastReceiver gets its call to start. My service creates a WindowManager as a system overlay and when the user triggers it, it is supposed to call the activity and make the activity make a new view with some stuff in it. Well everything goes through without a hitch, no errors popup and all my logs suggest that the code runs through smoothly, but the new view that is supposed to be made never comes to view. Interestingly enough though, if you click the app to start it again, up pops the view i wanted earlier. so Im curious as to why it doesnt happen when i want it to, but instead it remains invisible.

Negative 14948 pI am looking to replace certain reflectionbased parts of our code with ones that perform better using dynamic runtime compilation. Looking around I saw that both Mono and Microsoft have separate CompilerasaService solutions codeMono.CSharpcode and codeMicrosoft.CSharpcode.p  pWith the risk of asking an opinionbased question, Im wondering how these two comparep  pAs far as I can tell from a very superficial initial investigation, they both generally provide CAAS capabilities. I was able to compile a Hello World class using Microsoft.CSharp and execute it. And although I didnt do the same thing with the Mono one yet, Im assuming it could do the same.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with either or both and can comment on the issuep  hr  pstrongEditstrong I am not asking about a comparison of Monos C and Microsofts C  we are already familiar with and using both.

Negative 14948 pWe are creating CXF SOAP contractfirst web services. For that, we build our xsd, then use XJC to generate the java classes. We then create an interface for our endpoint and its implementation. In the spring file, we declare our endpoint, we activate the validation and set the shemaLocation. If we test the web service with SOAPUI and activate the validation of both request and response in SOAPUI, we get a validation error on the response p  blockquote   pline 4 Expected element responses... instead of readItemsResponse... here in element readItemsResponse...p blockquote  pThere is no error on the server side. If we turn off the response validation of SOAPUI, everything works fine. How is it possible to get this kind of error even though everything is done according to the xsd.p  pSpring declaration extract p  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt     ltbeans

Negative 14948 pIm so confused by graphs and adjacency matrices. Im doing an assignment for a class where I have a text file of nodes and a text file of edges and I have to read each of them and make them a graph onto which I can then perform operations such as determining if the graph is connected, finding a minimal spanning tree, traversals and finding paths. Ive never worked with graphs before though, and Im really confused by the whole thing, and I was wondering if someone could help explain some of this to me.p  pFirstly, do I build a graph on its own with node and edges classes perhaps and then construct an adjacency matrix from that Or is the adjacency matrix itself the graph p  pAnd then Im confused on how to implement the adjacent matrix into the program. The nodes are names things like ND5 and NR7 and so I would have to set and read the edges of [ND5][NR7] but Im not sure how to set up a 2d array like that with strings for the outside and numbers on the inside.p  pIve been searching all over the internet and read through the whole chapter on graphs in my textbook, and Im really not understanding just the first basic steps of getting this graph set up. Id really appreciate the help. Thanks.p

Negative 14948 pIm looking into a program that hits some sort of concurrency bottleneck when it goes from 4 to 8 threads. Using Yourkit, Ive watched the monitor profile, and it tells me that the threads are ending up blocked on the monitor of java.lang.ref.ReferenceLock while in a function which is not synchronized and not calling anything synchronized.p  pThere are zero, no, zilch, references to the class Reference.Lock or Reference in my code. Not in the function at the top of the stack when the profiler shows the threads blocked, and not anywhere else. There are, in fact, no references to any of the subclasses of Reference in any of my code at all. So this question is about the internal working of the JVM, not about my code. Presumably, behind my back, codenew char[100]code gets into this pickle, and Im asking about how and why.p  pIm using java 1.6.026 on a Linux box with 16 cores, otherwise relatively idle.p  pThe function in at the top of the backtrace does allocate. p

Negative 14948 pFor each owner in a database, I need the users of a web application to be able to click on different buttons to load different information.  For example, the code below is a jsp in which users select an owner at left, which loads detail information for the selected owner selowner at right.  Then there are three buttons for the selowner, one to show cats owned by selowner, another to show dogs owned by selowner, and a third to show all pets owned by selowner.  The instrumental code involves the url patterns in the three buttons, and the three cif tags, each surrounding a different dandelion datatable, which should either be visible or invisible, depending on which button is clicked by the user.  p  pHow do I set this up to work in my spring mvc hibernate maven application in eclipse  At the moment, the .endsWithcats or dogs or all clause is triggering an error message in eclipse saying that endsWith is not a supported method for String.

The way I call the oauth dialog is identical in both websites, except from the App ID of course and the redirect url.

When I call this url from my touch devices iphone or android, they both fail I am forcely redirected to the mobile version of the dialog a hrefhttpsm.facebook.comdialogoauthetc,etc relnofollowhttpsm.facebook.comdialogoauthetc,etca. However this dialog from m.facebook.com dies with 500 internal server error for one of the website. so one works perfectly with mobile oauth dialog, the other does not. I tried to open the m.facebook.cometcetc from my desktop pc and I could indeed see the 500 internal server error response. Should I try to login from the desktop which does not redirect to mobile version then the authentication procedure works perfectly.p  pAt first I thought this might be a facebook bug and that it would have been fixed within few hours at most, but its been now for at least 2 days and still does not work. I think I could really appreciate some advice at this point. Thank you all in advance.p

What I worry about is that the other frames have fully functional calculations based on the same blockp  precodeprivate class MassListener implements ActionListener      public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event          double pounds, kilograms          String text  mass.getText          pounds  Integer.parseInttext          kilograms  pounds2.2          rLabelM.setTextDouble.toStringkilograms          private class VolumeListener implements ActionListener      public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event          double litres, gallons          String text  volume.getText          gallons  Integer.parseInttext          litres  .264  gallons          rLabelV.setTextDouble.toStringlitres          private class DistListener implements ActionListener      public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event          double miles, kilo          String text  distance.getText          miles  Integer.parseInttext          kilo  miles  1.609          rLabelD.setTextDouble.toStringkilo          codepre  pAll of these work with EXACTLY the same coding without any errors.

I want to change that so the data isnt saved until the user at least click to pay. otherwise if for some reason the user stops here I end up with a database full of incomplete registrations.p  pstrongEditstrong Here is my attempt but it doesnt seem to be working.p  pstrongtempregister1.phpstrongp  precodeltphp  fnamePOST[fname]  echo ltDOCTYPE htmlgt     lthtml langengt    ltheadgt    lttitlegtlttitlegt   ltmeta charsetutf8gt    ltscriptgt     submitbtn.clickfunction        var fname  .fname.            .ajax       type POST,       url tempregister2.php,       data fnamefname                 ltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltform actionhttpswww.paypal.comcgibinwebscr methodpost targettopgt  ltinput typeimage namesubmit idsubmitbtn srchttpswww.paypalobjects.comenUSibtnbtnbuynowCCLG.gif gt  ltformgt  ltbodygt  lthtmlgt    end php echo  gt codepre  pstrongtempregister2.phpstrongp  precodeltphp  fnamePOST[fname]   requireoncedb.php conn  dbconnect  result  conngtprepareINSERT into temp FirstName VALUES result gt bindparams,fname resultgtexecute  gt codepre  pstrongEDITstrong  Problem Solved I needed to add this before the script in tempregister1.phpp  precodeltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt document.readyfunction   submitbtn.submitfunction  codepre  pNot sure if it made a difference but I also change it from a click event to a submit event  and changed var fname  .POST[fname]. to var fname  .POST[fname].br Thanks to everyone who helpedp

Negative 14948 pWere using App Game Kit for one of our apps and trying to remove AdMob so we can go with Chartboost. AGK uses an interpreter for their language that passes through NDK to java. They have a class called codeAGKHelpercode which is the entry point for the commands that currently call Facebook, AdMob, an alert dialogue and some other activities. Each of the methods in codeAGKHelpercode run events through codeRunnablecode classes. Heres an example of their procedure to make an alert dialoguep  precodepublic class AGKHelper      just a sample of whats in there many other methods exist     public static void ShowMessage Activity act, String msg               RunnableMessage run  new RunnableMessage         run.act  act         run.msg  msg         act.runOnUiThread run         codepre  pNow the codeRunnableMessagecode class that creates the alert dialogue.p  precodeclass RunnableMessage implements Runnable      public Activity act     public String msg      public void run              AlertDialog alertDialog             alertDialog  new AlertDialog.Builderact.create             alertDialog.setTitleMessage             alertDialog.setMessagemsg             alertDialog.setButton DialogInterface.BUTTONPOSITIVE, OK, new DialogInterface.OnClickListenerpublic void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which              alertDialog.show                codepre  pThere also exists a codeCreateAdcode method that makes ads for AdMob using coderunOnUiThreadcode, but with a codeWindowManagercode to show the ads.  As far as we can tell we MUST use codeRunnablecode to get the activity going for Chartboost. We followed Chartboosts SDK integration and we get stuck at creating our codeRunnablecode for it. All of the codeRunnablescode that codeAGKHelpercode uses also refer back to the codeNativeActivitycode by, we believe, passing it as a parameter to the method like codeShowMessagecode and then doing something with it in the Runnable class for each of these methods. Such asp  precodeAlertDialog.Builderact for the message ad  new AdViewact, AdSize.BANNER, pubID for AdMob  RunnableAd feed.dialogact, feed, parameters,new DialogListener   for RunnableFacebook codepre  pUnfortunately there doesnt appear to be a way to pass the codeNativeActivitycode to the Chartboost runnable. Were very inexperienced with java so were learning as we go and feel like we make progress, but then nothing happens.p  pDoes anyone have a full example of a codeRunnablecode class that gets Chartboost to show Wed very much appreciate the help. I would share more of the codeAGKHelpercode class here, such as the full codeRunnableAdcode method, but it is long and filled with codeWindowsManagercode setup. codeRunnableMessagecode is the shortest example I can provide.

Negative 14948 pOkay, this is a bit complicated, at least for me. At first, I was making a Javascript game of Simon. Everything was working fine, until I realized that I never played Simon before. The rules of the game changed, and I had to recode my entire game. p  pInstead of showing a full sequence before each players turn, I have to show bits of the sequence at a time before each players turn. This is a huge problem for me, it seems. Ive tried everything to get this to work correctly, but right now the only thing that happens is it gives me the alert messages up to player1Turn alert until it goes haywire. This is extremely important for me to figure out, since its a project.p  pIt seems right now that the code doesnt record the players input.

Negative 14948 pI have a web site and would like to expose certain functionalities using WCF.p  pBefore deciding which type of WCF project I need to use I wanted to compare the differences between codeWCF Class librarycode and codeWCF applicationcode. strongI know this question has been asked many times and answered many timesstrong and the answers are usually about different hosting options each one offers but I wanted to try and see the differences, so this is what I triedp  pstrongStep 1 strong In a same solution, I have created a codeWCF Service librarycode project and created Client console app project, set the console app as a startup project, referenced the service library project from the client project and in the client console app I could instantiate the service and can consume the service methods. I didnt even add a service reference to the client project. p  pstrongStep 2 strong In a same solution, I have created a codeWCF Service applicationcode project and created Client console app project, set the console app as a startup project, referenced the service application project from the client project and in the client console app I could instantiate the service and can consume the service methods. I didnt even add a service reference to the client project. p  pOn both steps after compiling the solutions I was able to copy the client apps exe and the service dlls to a different location and still be able to run the clients.p  pBased on this little excercie I am confused about the hosting part. It seems wether I use WCF Class library or WCF application type I get the same result.p  pThis is just like using multiple projects in a solution, you reference one from another and use the methods, there must be something I am missing which highlights the differences between the two and highlights the benefits of using WCF, also in the past I remember I had to add a service reference to the clients apps in order to consume the service, why is this not the case herep  pThanksp

Negative 14948 pI have converted some pages into SEOfriendly URLs.  p  pOld formatp  precodemydomain.commyscript.phpf1ampt2 codepre  pNew formatp  precodemydomain.comf1t2somestufftaggedon.html codepre  pBecause I have some stuff tagged on to the URL, this redirect is done in php where stuff tagged on requires a bit of logic and processing.  End result, I get a URL that Im happy with.p  pTo process the new format, Ive created a rewrite rule which ensures the new format gets process by myscript.  It looks like this  p  precodeRewriteRule f[09]t[09]. myscript.phpf1ampt2ampfriendly1 [NC,L] codepre  pThis works well.  It doesnt change the URL in the browser but does execute myscript.php and renders the page.  Note, I added a variable friendly to tell the php script not to redirect to the friendly version, but just render the page.p  pThis all works great.  Im sure there are more elegant solutions, but Im happy with this and most importantly IT WORKS.p  pSo my question is  I want to specify that the new format is permanent ie 301 redirect.  Where should I specify this  In the php redirect from old format to the new format  Or in the .htaccess rewrite that doesnt change the URL  Im thinking the former but thought I would check with you guys.p

Negative 14948 pI have two custom element directivesp  precodeltmydirectiveparentgtltmydirectiveparentgt only one codepre  pandp  precodeltmydirectivechildgtltmydirectivechildgt variable count codepre  pThe codemydirectiveparentcode directive has its own emcontrollerem and emtemplateUrlem properties defined in its emdirective definition objectem. The codemydirectivechildcode directive has its own emlinkem, emscopeem, emtemplateUrlem and emrequireem properties defined in its emdirective definition objectem. The fourth parameter passed into the link function is the parent codemydirectiveparentcodes controller. This is working as expected.p  pBased on user input, instances of codemydirectivechildcode are appended to or removed from the parent codemydirectiveparentcode DOM via the codemydirectiveparentcodes controller. Since Im using ngView for the toplevel page, changing pages results in Angular automatically cleaning up the various directives and their controllers of the toplevel page. Upon returning, the controller for the page reruns, but the user appended views do not show up since they were previously wiped out automatically by Angular. Im using a service which holds the data representing the collection of codemydirectivechildcode instances that were previously added.p  pMy issue lies in restoring the codemydirectivechildcode directives based on this cached service data. Currently, when the codemydirectiveparentcode directives controller is run, Im getting the service data array that represents the instances to be added, looping through it, and adding a new codemydirectivechildcode instance to the DOM. This is working, but upon restoring each instance I need to prepopulate it with data that was previously entered by the user of which is recorded in the service. Currently, when adding to the DOM this way each instance is in a blank state instead of a desired prepopulated state.p  pSo I have the data needed to recreate the child directive instances, but Im unable to prepopulate them with the necessary data.p  pIve tried to place a custom attr on the codemydirectivechildcode in an effort to forward the data to the instances scope, but I learned from Angulars API docs thatp  blockquote   pThe new scope rule does not apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scopep blockquote  pQuestionsp  ul liIs my approach wrong What should I be doingli liIs there a way to pass attrs defined on the actual element directive into the directives scope that represents the inner template HTMLli liHow do I ensure a custom directive within a custom directive properly prepopulates itselfli ul  pThank you in advance for any ideas, answers, or thoughts that might lead to a solid solution.p

To illustrate, I have the following JSON p  precodedata [            tags [         foo,         bar,         hello,         world,         alice       ],       date [         1402876800000       ],       ...     ,            tags [         foo,         world,         alice       ],       date [         1402963200000       ],       ...      codepre  pWhat I want to do is be able to call a function which takes an input of the tag foo, for example, and writes into the HTML how many times that tag occurs on a particular date.

Negative 14948 pWe are discussing at a client how to boot strap auto scale AWS instances. Essentially, a instance comes up with hardly anything on it. It has a generic startup script that asks somewhere what am I supposed to do nextp  pIm thinking we can use amazon tags, and have the instance itself ask AWS using awscli tool set to find out its role. This could give puppet info, environment info devstageprod for example and so on. This should be doable with just the DescribeTags privilege. Im facing resistance however.p  pI am looking for suggestions on how a fresh AWS instance can find out about its own purpose, whether from AWS or perhaps from a service broker of some sort.p

Negative 14948 pI tried adding vectored exception handling to my Win32 DLL, but the call to codeAddVectoredExceptionHandlercode never returns.  I just get the unhelpful codeltapp namegt.exe has stopped workingcode dialog.  However, if I debug the dll with the Visual C debugger, then it does work, and the handler function gets called at the appropriate time, and all is well.p  pTo be explicit, Im adding the handler when my DLL is initialized, like sop  precodeOutputDebugStringbefore addingn AddVectoredExceptionHandler 1, VectoredExcepHandler  OutputDebugStringafter addingn codepre  pand when not run through a debugger, DebugView shows before adding and not after adding.p  pThe handler itself looks like the followingp  precodestatic LONG CALLBACK VectoredExcepHandler PEXCEPTIONPOINTERS exInfo       OutputDebugStringreached handlern     return EXCEPTIONCONTINUESEARCH  codepre  pOh, Im running Vista Home 64 if that matters.p  pEvent Viewer shows that the error is an access violation in kernel32.dll.p  hr  pFurther discoveries that pretty much solve the problem  I found that if I commented out the codeOutputDebugStringcode call in the handler, the error went away.  So I guess theres some exception that is incompatible with codeOutputDebugStringcode.  And apparently its not one of the common ones that I might want to examine, like access violation and invalid instruction, because if I check for those exception codes before calling codeOutputDebugStringcode, all is well.p

Negative 14948 pI am having issues attempting to connect to two different databases in one Qt Application. I have my information database that stores all the information collected by the application and the new Log database which allows me to track all the changes that occur to the Application, button presses, screen loads etc, for easy debugging after its release. Separately, the databases work perfectly, but when I try to use both of them, only one will work. I read that this could be because I wasnt naming the connections and obviously only the most recently connected database could use the default connection. However when I give the databases names they wont work at all, isOpen will return true on both, but as soon as they attempt to execute a query I get the errorsp  precodeQSqlQueryprepare database not open  QSqlError1, Driver not loaded, Driver not loaded codepre  pMy two database declarations arep  precodedatabaselocation  filepath.appendlogger.sqlite logDB  QSqlDatabaseaddDatabaseQSQLITE, LoggerDatabaseConnection logDB.setHostNamelocalhost logDB.setDatabaseNamedatabaselocation codepre  pfor the Logger Database connection and p  precodedatabaselocation  filepath.appenddb.sqlite db  QSqlDatabaseaddDatabaseQSQLITE,  NormalDB db.setHostNamelocalhost db.setDatabaseNamedatabaselocation codepre  pAlso when I am running the first query on the databases to see if their tables exist I am usingp  precodeQSqlQuery queryLoggerDatabaseConnection codepre  pand likewise for the normal database, but I am still getting connection issues even after declaring the database connection to run the query on.p  pThe database used for the application is declared as a static QSqlDatabase in a namespace to create a global effect, so everyone can access it, that was a previous programmer, and I created the Log database as Singleton with a private database connection. Like I said both versions of the code work separately but when they are together they are fighting each other. I know there is a huge debate over the proper design of Singleton vs Dependecy Injection, but again the code works separately so I am happy with how it is designed for now. If there is any missing information or if you have any ideas, please let me know. Thank you.p

Negative 14948 pLol, it seems that this question has not ever been asked before in google. p  pSo, what I am trying to do is to send email via php form.

Where in the email there would be some products to show to the addressed email. p  pWhat I want to do with the SESSION in the email is when the people who has the email adress click one of products in the news letter and come to  the page, the page will get from whom he got the link to the page. p  pstrong[EDIT]strongp  pI dont want to achieve it with a string like this codeindex.phpemailemailampusernameusernamecode since this can only be set to one link not global link and strongthis can also be manipulated by the new coming people.strong p  pWhat I mean by global link is, as what I mentioned above, there would be many products I am going to represent in the newsletter, such as ..producta.php, ..productb.php, ..productc.php, ..productd.php, and so on.

Negative 14948 pI have cordovaionicangularJS application I am currently testing using phonegap app on ios. This application uses websockets to receive external inbound messages. An angular service function pushes the new messages in an array and binds the array to a scope. I then use rootScope.apply to propagate the change to my view that displays this array of messages. p  pEverything works fine except when I pause and resume the application. In that case any new incoming message is indeed correctly stored in the messages array however the view is not updated as I would expect from apply. Leaving the view and returning to it fixes the problem. Its as if reloading the views controller and calling the service resets something.p

Negative 14948 pI am creating an app feature to my existing app that will allow pharmacy patients to enter their name which will display a list of names in a table view, then click on a name, and there is another table view where they can add medications, and then click on a medication and there is another table view where they can add reminders to take their medications delivered via Local notifications. I have everything setup except for the form where they add a reminder where they select a time, ampm, and are able to repeat every minute, or hour, or everyday and will also have a title of this reminder. For example, it will say Aspirin as a title, and then below it in a subtitle 800AM Everyday, then the next reminder on the list in the reminder table view would show Aspirin and 800Pm everyday. This form will allow them to add a reminder for each medication they take. p  pI just cant figure out what classes or frameworks I should start with this. I need the Alarm feature of the repeat interval and then I need that to turn into a notification. I think I can handle the rest as far as getting the information to show up in the table. But I need a way to build this simple form. Any Suggestions  p

Negative 14948 pSo Im not the best at JS, still learning.. Im trying to figure out how I would make the current tooltip close if they click on another tooltip I still want them to be able to click the tooltips close X button to close it as well though. But having multiple tooltips opening is really annoying, they pile on top of one another if you dont click the close button.

Negative 14948 pIve encountered an issue wrapping nested sapply pasting code into ifelse that checks to see that all the components are nonNA. The sapplys work great when they arent in the ifelse... Why is thisp  pGiven some parametersp  precodea  c1, 2, 3 b  ca, b c  cX, Y codepre  pHeres how Ive managed to paste together all the combinationsp  precodeas.vectorsapplysapplya, functionxpastex, b, sep  ,                   functionxpastex, c, sep   codepre  pThe output is this.

To clarify, the is.na is checking to see if the emwhole vectorem is NA, NOT for things like c1, NA, 3 because Ill be using the code in a context where that wont ever happen. Im doing this because the ifelses are part of larger function where the parameters default to NA certain combinations of nonNA parameters require a certain actions. For example, if b  NA, then the code above should produce an ERROR. How can I accomplish both the nested pasting AND the conditional checkingp

Negative 14948 pI am basically looking for a unit testing framework, which I can use to compare POJOs which dont override equals and hascode methods. I had a look at JUnit, Test NG and Mockito but they dont seem to solve the purpose.p  pFor example consider the code below p  precodepublic class CarBean        private String brand     private String color      public CarBean            public CarBean String brand, String color         this.brand brand         this.color color                  return the brand           public String getBrand          return brand                  param the brand to set           public void setBrandString brand          this.brand brand                  return the color           public String getColor          return color                  param the color to set           public void setColorString color          this.color color       codepre  pThe POJO CarBean represents a real world car. It has two parameters, brand and color. Now, suppose you have two car objects as below p  precodeCarBean car1  new CarBeanFord,Black CarBean car2  new CarBeanFord,Black codepre  pBoth the objects have same parameter values. But when you compare this using equals, it returns false p  precodecar1.equalscar2  This returns false codepre  pNow I need to unit test a method that returns CarBean object. In this scenario I would either need to compare the carbean attributes one by one or I would need to implement equals and hashcode methods.p  pSo my question is  Is there already a unit testing framework which can handle this p

Negative 14948 pUpdate p  pHad nothing to do with Core Data or the CollectionView. I never dismissed the ViewController holding the CollectionView. More in the answer belowp  hr  pI am having a memory leak in Swift iOS. First I thought it was located in my fetch function, but then I tried something different. I broke the connection between my codeUICollectionViewCellcode and my codeManaged Objectcode at various places. I am fetching images. So I replaced the result from my fetch with a random image asset that was added to an array for as many times as there were results. This always fixed my leak. So now I knew it wasnt a problem in my fetch function, any other function on the way to the Cell. p  pAfter some googling I found that Core Data has some tendency to create strong reference cycles on its own. But I dont think that that is it. If it was, it shouldnt matter that I dont use the resulting array of images in a Cell. I should still have a leak, but when I dont connect the images from Core Data to the Cell I have no leak.p  pWhat I dont understand is why I have a leak in the first place. I thought that arrays work like values, not references. So putting images loaded from core data in an array should work like a copy and there shouldnt be any strong reference cycle...p  pI also found that refreshing the Managed Object that has the Binary Data atribute for the images doesnt fix the problem. p  pSo what do I do now Do I need to delete all the cells Do I need to make UIImages out of the NSData from Core Data glanced over something that said that Strings work like values but NSStrings dont, so maybe an NSData thingy works like a reference Do I need to find a way to refresh the attribute of an object...p  pThanksp  pFetchalso tried setting things as codeweakcode, doesnt workp  precode    import UIKit     import CoreData       func getFilteredThumbImages albumIdentifier String, moc  NSManagedObjectContext gt [NSData]           var error NSError          let resultPredicate  NSPredicateformat iD  , albumIdentifier         let albumfetchRequest  NSFetchRequestentityName Album         albumfetchRequest.predicate  resultPredicate         var results  moc.executeFetchRequestalbumfetchRequest, erroramperror          if error  nil               weak var tempFThumbs  results.last.mutableSetValueForKeyfilteredThumbs              weak var testFoundImages  tempFThumbs.mutableSetValueForKeyimageData              var foundImages  testFoundImages.allObjects as [NSData]              moc.refreshObjectresults.last as NSManagedObject, mergeChanges false              moc.reset             return foundImages                  else              moc.refreshObjectresults.last as NSManagedObject, mergeChanges false             appDel.managedObjectContext.reset              moc.reset              return nil                codepre  pUICollectionViewCell p  precodeimport UIKit  class CollectionViewCell UICollectionViewCell        required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder          super.initcoder aDecoder          let textLabel UILabel     let imageView UIImageView      override initframe CGRect          NSLogMyObject init         super.initframe frame          imageView  UIImageViewframe CGRectx 0, y 0, width frame.size.width, height frame.size.height         imageView.backgroundColor  UIColorred1, green0.992, blue0.965, alpha1         imageView.contentMode  UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFit         imageView.clipsToBounds  true         contentView.backgroundColor  UIColorred1, green0.992, blue0.965, alpha1         contentView.addSubviewimageView        codepre  pInput images in Cellthumbs is a variable array  [NSData]p  precodefunc collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UICollectionViewCell           printlnloading...         weak var cell  collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifierCollectionViewCell, forIndexPath indexPath as CollectionViewCell          cell.imageView.image  UIImagenamed test           if thumbs  nil              cell.imageView.image  UIImagedata thumbs[indexPath.row]             printlnloading thumbs.count cells                      return cell      codepre

Negative 14948 pWe have a situation where we have to perform a lengthy query to the database based on human input. As the input changes, the query has to be done over and over again, and the input may change once per second.p  pThe problem is, we know that this will cause a spike in server activity for several seconds, and since it is not critical to have an answer immediately or on every input change, it means we can afford executing or not executing the query.p  pThe criteria we would like to use is the current state of the database server, and only allow the query to be done if it is in a low or medium load state, skipping the query when the database server is under stress.p  pWe use Oracle database for this, and so far we have not found any way, from Java, to do this except by actually loading into the server a known query and benchmark it, but that is essentially adding some load to the server. So my question is there any other way, specifically in Oracle database, where we can discover from the Java side of the application the load of the databasep

Negative 14948 pNesting codeNSSplitViewcode instances leads to a strange behavior. When dragging the nested splitViews splitter, the parent splitViews splitter can be moved to accomodate a larger child as a sideeffect of the dragging.p  pHere is an URL to a minimalist project which reproduces this problem. Simply drag the rightmost splitter towards the right until the leftmost splitter starts moving on its own. a hrefhttpfilebin.ca20ymCpNmtts7NestedSplitTest.zip relnofollowhttpfilebin.ca20ymCpNmtts7NestedSplitTest.zipap  pTo my understanding, the cause of the problem is that when dragging a splitViews splitter, a new constraint is added binding the right edge of the contentView on the left side of the dragged splitter to the left edge of the codeNSSplitViewcode itself. This constraint is removed when the drag is complete. While the drag is ongoing and the splitter gets constrained by the minimum widths of other panels, then the total of this temporary constraints constant value exceeds the width that the pane can resize to and this makes the NSSplitView itself grow larger, which in turn resizes the outermost splitter.p  pI have tried using a codeNSSplitViewDelegatecode to constrain the split position but this delegate method is called after the NSSplitView has already grown because of the temporary constraint. Implementing one of the codeconstrainMinCoordinatecode or codeconstrainMaxCoordinatecode delegate methods makes the codeNSSplitViewcode completely ignore the minimum widths configured on the panels.p  pAlso, I cannot seem to get a proper event when a drag starts or ends, either through notifications or by subclassing codeNSSplitViewcode. Having a hook on both of these events would allow me to add a temporary constraint to make sure the NSSplitView cant grow outwardly. Even overriding codemouseDowncode and codemouseUpcode didnt work because codemouseUpcode never got called after the drag ended.p  pstrongUpdate 1strong I have found an explanation for the reason codemouseUpcode is not called  it is because the dragging of the splitter is implemented using a nested RunLoop that runs in codeNSEventTrackingRunLoopModecode. This is how the codemouseDraggedcode and codemouseUpcode events get swallowed silently.

Negative 14948 pIm working on an at least 8 years old project that is using JSP,  the library used for AJAX is a hrefhttpsajax4jsf.dev.java.netajax relnofollowhttpsajax4jsf.dev.java.netajaxa, based on my understanding it was acquired by RichFaces 3.x, and right now no one is supporting it. we found out in a hard way that this library has some bugs and we want to update the library without moving to JSF 2 we dont have resources.  we dont use any 3rd party objects like RichFaces in our project and places we use AJAX is handful and we can change the code there if necessary.p  pis there any newer ajax library that is compatible with our old application thanks a lot p

It logs into the site, checks a few things then closes the browser ready for the next iteration.p  pFollowing cucumber convention Ive put the urls, user Ids and pwds into an examples table. It works correctly in that it validates each site but, on the 2nd and subsequent iterations after the first browser close, it can take up to a minute to restart the browser.

Negative 14948 pIm working on a 2D game for android so performance is a real issue and a must. In this game there might occur a lot of collisions between any objects and I dont want to check in bruteforce on2 whether any gameobject collides with another one. In order to reduce the possible amount of collision checks I decided to use spatial hashing as broadphase algorithm becouse it seems quite simple and efficient  dividing the scene on rows and columns and checking collisions between objects residing only in the same grid element.p  pHeres the basic concept I quickly scratchedp  precodepublic class SpatialHashGridElement      HashSetltGameObjectgt gameObjects  new HashSetltGameObjectgt  static final int SPATIALHASHGRIDROWS  4 static final int SPATIALHASHGRIDCOLUMNS  5 static SpatialHashGridElement[] spatialHashGrid  new SpatialHashGridElement[SPATIALHASHGRIDROWS  SPATIALHASHGRIDCOLUMNS]  void updateGrid  float spatialHashGridElementWidth  screenWidth  SPATIALHASHGRIDCOLUMNS float spatialHashGridElementHeight  screenHeight  SPATIALHASHGRIDROWS forSpatialHashGridElement e  spatialHashGrid     e.gameObjects.clear forGameObject go  displayList      forint i  0 i lt go.vertices.length3 i              int row  int Math.absgo.vertices[i3  1]  spatialHashGridElementHeight  SPATIALHASHGRIDROWS         int col  int Math.absgo.vertices[i3  0]  spatialHashGridElementWidth  SPATIALHASHGRIDCOLUMNS         ifspatialHashGrid[row  SPATIALHASHGRIDCOLUMNS  col].gameObjects.containsgo             spatialHashGrid[row  SPATIALHASHGRIDCOLUMNS  col].gameObjects.addgo        codepre  pThe code isnt probably of the highest quality so if you spot anything to improve please dont hesitate to tell me but the most worrying problem that arises currently is that in 2 grid cells there might be same collision pairs checked. Worst case example assuming none of the objects spans more than 2 cellsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGf6NZ.png altenter image description herep  pHere we have 2 gameObjects collidingred and blue. Each of them resides in 4 cells  therefore in each cell there will be the same pair to check.

Is there some brilliant way to detect that some collision pair has been already inserted even during the updateGrid function I will be very grateful for any tipsp

Negative 14948 pSimply put  I want to draw a rayline from the near clipping plane out to the far clipping plane using a perspective projection. I have what I believe are correctly normalized world coordinates generated from a mouse click using methods describe in various OpenGLgraphics programming guides.p  pThe problem I am having is that it seems my ray is being drawn from outside the near clipping plane.p  pBackground This is for a simple model viewer I am building in Qt that requires a picking capability. I need to draw the ray in order to calculate intersections with objects in the scene. However, my basic problem is that I can seem to draw the ray correctly.p  pMy perspective projection is definedp  precodegluPerspectivefov, aspect, 0.1, 100.0 codepre  pwhere fov is 45.0 degress, and aspect is the ratio of the window widthheight.p  pUsing my picking code, Ive generated what I believe to be correctly normalized world coordinates based off of mouse clicks. An example of these coordinatesp  precode0.385753,0.019608,0.100000 codepre  pHowever, when I try to draw a ray starting at that point, it looks like it is being drawn from outside of the clipping planep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeQ1GH.png altenter image description herep  pMaybe I am expecting something different, but in the example above I clicked on the nose of the airplane, generated the world coordinates above, and I am drawing the ray incorrectly or so I believe. I was hoping to see the line being drawn from the location of the mouse click into the airplane model.p  pWhen I draw the ray I first load the identity matrix, and then draw a line from the near clipping plane coordinates to the far plane. Then I draw a sphere at the end of the ray in this screenshot it is behind the plane.p  precode            glPushMatrix             glLoadIdentity              glColor3f0,0,1             glBeginGLLINES             glVertex3fnearray.x, nearray.y, nearray.z             glVertex3ffarray.x, farray.y, farray.z             glEnd              glTranslateffarray.x, farray.y, farray.z              glColor3f1,0,0             glutWireSphere1, 10, 10              glPopMatrix codepre  pAny hints as to what I am doing wrong The codefarraycode coordinates are the same as the codenearraycode except for the Z field. I want the ray to be drawn straight into the scene.p  pstrongIn The End...strong Id just like to know how the draw the ray itself. I understand that there might be errors in my code that generates the coordinates, but what if I just wanted to draw an arbitrary ray from the near clipping plane straight into the scene. That is that Id like answered.p

Negative 14948 pIm hoping for some clarifications for query performance in elastic 1.5.2 I observed recently.p  pI have a string field with high cardinality approx 200,000,000. I observed that if I use a simple terms aggregation with execution hint globalordinalslowcardinality, two things happen 1. The query returns same results as with globalordinals, or globalordinalshash. 2. The query performs significantly faster. about twice as fast as globalordinals, and 4 times as fast as globalordinalshash.p  pHeres the queryp  precode    aggs        myTerms           terms              field myField,             size 1000,             shardsize 1000,             executionhint globalordinalslowcardinality                       codepre  pI dont understand why its even legitimate to use globalordinalslowcardinality in this instance, because my field has a high cardinality. So perhaps I dont understand what exactly globalordinalslowcardinality meansp  pSecondly, I have another numerical field long, with roughly same cardinality value. The values of the long field are actually precomputed hash values murmur3 for the same string field from above, which i use to greatly speedup cardinality aggregation. Running the same terms aggregation on the numerical field performs as bad as globalordinalshash. In fact, it doesnt matter what execution hint i use, execution time remains the same.p  pSo why is globalordinalslowcardinality applicable for string types, but not for long types Is it because numerical fields do not require global ordinals at allp  pThanksp

Negative 14948 pI have a web application which needs to be tested in multiple browsers in multiple environments i.e. Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer in both Windows and Linux with the obvious exception of Internet Explorer. p  pTests have been written in Java using JBehave, Selenium, and SerenityBDD Thucydides. These tests exercise an underlying REST API, testing if objects may be successfully created and deleted using the UI. p  pI am using Selenium Grid, and would like to run the tests on parallel nodes however, the concern is that as the tests exercise an underlying REST API, there could be conflicts. p  pIs it possible to pass in parameters to the tests as a parameter within the Jenkins job configuration which runs the tests, so that there is a slight difference in the tests dependent on the node in which they are executing e.g. An object named MYOBJECTCHROME is created on Chrome, versus an object named MYOBJECTFIREFOX on Firefox, meaning any REST API conflicts can be avoided p
