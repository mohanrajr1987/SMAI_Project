After spending half the day staring at my screen Ive even come up with a way to do this linearly if I discount any duplicates, but I have to keep duplicates So, as far as I know in order to compare any arrays you need at least 2 for loops which would be ON2 wouldnt it Im also not allowed to hash anything. p  pFor example if I had 1,3,4,3,4,5 as a master and 1,1,3,5,9,3,7 and 3,5,8,4,0,3,2 as arrays to be compared Id need to have a final of 3,3,5 since I cant get rid of any dupiclates.p  pI dont want anyone to write the code, I just need to know what I should be doing in the first place.p

Positive 588 pI would like to compare two arrays, if at least one value can be found on both arrays.p  pstrongScenario 1 strong code2code is found in both arrays, so the result is codetruecode.p  precodeString[] x  1,2,3 String[] y  2,5,6 codepre  pstrongScenario 2 strong No matching value, so the result is codefalsecode.p  precodeString[] x  1,2,3 String[] y  4,5,6 codepre  pIs there any builtin method in Java, or any library that can handle this requirementp  pI would like to emphasize that I am looking for a Java library or any Java method that can do this out of the box.p  pThe codeCollection.containscode is not an option because all values in both arrays should be the same in order to return true.

Positive 588 pWhat is the associativity of comparison operators in Python It is straightforward for three comparisons, but for more than that, Im not sure how it does it. They dont seem to be right or leftassociative.p  pFor examplep  precodegtgtgt 7410 gt 8690 lt 4538 lt 9319 gt 7092         False     gtgtgt 7410 gt 8690 lt 4538 lt 9319 gt 7092  True codepre  pSo, not leftassociative.p  precodegtgtgt 81037572 gt 2025 lt 4722 lt 6493            False gtgtgt 81037572 gt 2025 lt 4722 lt 6493      True codepre  pSo its not rightassociative either.p  pI have seen some places that they are chained, but how does that work with four or more comparisonsp
Positive 588 pI have a maddeningly simple task and be patient with me, Im new to all this I have a div with a table inside, and the table contains one row and two cells, sidebyside. One cell contains header text, the next cell contains a paragraph of body text. It looks great on large screens, bad on small ones. So when the viewport width goes below 890px, I want to pile the two on top of each other by breaking the cells into two different rows.p  pFirst, just let me say that, yes, I have to use the table. I know using tables for layout is clunky, but its necessary for vertically centering everything inside the div.p  pSo my solution to this problem was to write some JQuery that would take the current contents of the table, fetched using the codehtmlcode method, compare them to the initial state contents of the table at larger viewport widths, and then replace the contents with a final state string that just has codelttrgtlttrgtcode inserted after the first cells codelttdgtcode tag.p  pThe variable containing the initial state table contents is exactly the same as the table contents returned by the codehtmlcode method but with codencode at the end of each line except the last the extra backslash to tell JS that its a multiline string. I ran a codestrcmpcode on the strings in MATLAB to ensure I didnt make any stupid mistakes, came back true. And when I ask JS to print both strings to the console, they look identical. But when I ask JS if theyre codecode, I get a false.p  pSo I made a second variable for the initial state with coderncode instead of codencode because I read that some browsers do newlines differently. Checked if the current table contents were equal to either of them. Nope.p  pWhats going on herep

Positive 588 pUnder the comparisonbased model, how many comparisons are needed to sort a given list of n binary bits x1, x2, . . . , xn, where xi  0, 1, e.g., to sort list 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 to 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 Note that you are only allowed to use comparisons between the given bits, not to compare the given bits directly with 1 or 0 like if x5  1.

Positive 588 pI am wondering about the best approach to the belowp  pI have a .NET Web application and I am changing the ORM provider I am using.  To do this I have created a new solution and removed the previous ORM and implemented my new one.  As there are lots of existing screens that work with the previous ORM I want to make sure that the same object is returned by both ORMS.  As these are in two separate VS slns is there a simple way I can compare the complex objects that all the same properties have been loaded on to the object graph.  I could set a breakpoint and compare them manually but I dont really want to do this p
Positive 588 pI am checking two different directories that the user enters to make sure they dont contain any of the symbols that windows doesnt allow for folder names.

What actually happens though is that if I enter an invalid character the program doesnt find it and runs through until it actually opens that directory, at which point it crashes because it wont find a folder with an invalid character.

What is the best way to stop this from happeningp  pTo phrase it another way, I want to insert control data throughout my real data without there being a way for a third party to calculate which rows are control and which are real. hr  Update I have made this a community wiki so if anyone wants to edit my question so it makes more sense then go right ahead. hr  Update Let me try an example I do not want to make this language or platform dependent as it is not a coding question, it is a statistical question.p  ulliI have 3000 rows of real data this amount will change from run to run, depending on the amount of data the user has.li liI have 20 rows of control data again, this will change depending on the number of control rows the user wants to use, anything from zero upwards.liul  pI now want to insert these 20 control rows emroughlyem after every 150 rows or real data has been inserted 300020  150. However I do not want it to be as accurate as that as I do not want the control rows to be identifiable simply based on their location in the output data.p  pTherefore I do not mind emsomeem of the control rows being clumped together or for there to be emsomeem sections with very few or no control rows at all, but generally I want the control rows fairly evenly distributed throughout the data.p

Negative 588 pI know, it depends on the webapp. But in the normal case, what do you do one servlet, that serves different pages like an standaloneapplication with changing content or for every page a single servlet.p  pTake for instance a blog. There is the startpage with the most recent blogentries, an articleview for displaying one blogentry and an archive. Do you implement this with three different servlets, or one that is dispatching to the functions.

Negative 588 pIf I have a formbacking object that has a complicated object tree  say a Person that has a Contact Info object that has an Address object that has a bunch of Strings  it seems that the object needs to be fully populated with component objects before I can bind to it.  So if Im creating a new Person, I need to make sure it has all the component objects populated off the bat, and if Im retrieving a Person from the database, I need to make sure that any objects that arent populated from the database get populated with empty objects.p  pFirst question, of course  am I correct in my assumptions above  It does seem that if I try to bind to person.contactInfo.homeAddress.street and there is no ContactInfo, I get a null pointer exception.p  pSecond, whats the best way to initialize my object.  I can think of a couple of approaches.  One is to initialize all member objects at declarationp  precodepublic class Person       String name      ContactInfo contactInfo  new ContactInfo      getters, setters, etc.   public class ContactInfo       String phone      Address homeAddress  new Address  codepre  pand so forth.p  pAnother approach is to have a PersonFactory that initializes everything or to have a factory method Person.getInstance that initializes everything.p  pIn the case of retrieving a Person from the database, the first approach will solve the issue i.e. if this particular person doesnt have an address in the database, the object will still have an Address, but this will mean creating each object twice.  Not sure how to handle this otherwise, except to make the DAO explicitly populate everything even if nothing has been retrieved from the database.  Or to give the factory a method to go through the object and fill in anything thats missing.p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 588 pHi there Im not a developer and so am unaware of best practices.  I created this to bypass manual data copying of log data.

I want to load the view controllers lazily, just when I need them. But to do that, I need to have some kind of array that will give me the corresponding class for a given index, so that I can initialize it. p  pI ended up creating a method with a big switchstatement, that will just do that nasty allocation and initialization separately for every single view controller. Im not happy with that. There it would be much better if I could assign the appropriate class to a variable, and then at the end of the switch statement just allocate and initialize that class from the variable.p  pIs there a way to achieve thatp  pEDIT Ive found a function p  precodeid classcreateInstanceClass cls, sizet extraBytes codepre  pand every class seems to have a property class.

Why is this any different from the situation where the base function is nonrecursivep  pA few possible reasons I can see for this being the case are p  ol lipfor whatever reason the implementation of the Scala compiler doesnt handle this fair enough if that is the case. If so, are there plans to change thispli lipin codeFoocode the codemodcode function is munged to codemodnonrecursivecode during compilation so codeFoocode doesnt actually have a codemodcode method to override.pli ol

How do I get to the button name in order to make the codedoSubmitcode work properlyp
Negative 588 pIm definetely new to any kind of graphics maybe except taking photos  so please forgive if my explanation of problem I faced last night is not very precise and understable.p  pIm trying to generate code in Cocoa which would draw vectors on the base of SVG files. Ive translated SVG commands into calls of NSBezierPath methods but received graphics is not really good... The shape is similar to the basic one but there are some... distortions. Its probably neither an issue of antialiasing nor flatness value set on Cocoa side. I was suggested that the problem may result from different interpretation of control points of Bzier curves by Cocoa methods ang SVG  is that possible Or what else may cause the problemp
Negative 588 pHey guys I am having an issue when Im trying to display a cfdiv inside a cfwindow. It just doesnt show up. No errors, nothing to tell me Im doing something wrong. The div works just fine if I display it in the page outside of the cfwindow. The cfdiv binds to a page that displays notes. If I try to do a cfinclude with the page the cfdiv binds to I get an error saying that the template cant be found, or there needs to be a mapping. I also have a cftext area inside a cfform and Im trying to do richtext with it, however it doesnt work either inside of the cfwindow. Is cfwindow incapable of doing this, or is there a trick I dont know about. If you need any other information Ill be happy to provide it. p  precodeltcfdiv bindurladminnotesnoteDiv.cfmnoteCategorybusinessListingurl.listingID idnoteDivgt codepre

I used a combination of WinDbg and perfmon to track the memory use over time from a couple hours to days. The total number of bytes on all CLR heaps does not increase by more than I expect, but the total number of private bytes steadily increases as more messages are logged. This makes WinDbg less useful, as its tools sos and commands dumpheap, gcroot, etc. are based on .NETs managed memory.p  pThis is likely why GC.Collect can not help me, as it is only looking for free memory on the CLR heap. My leak appears to be in unmanaged memory.p

Negative 588 pit seems that as soon as data is ready for the host such as when I use WriteFile to send a command to the HID in which I tell the HID to give back some data such as the port value and the in packet ready bit is set, the host reads it as confirmed by another USB interrupt before ReadFile ever is called. ReadFile is later used to put this data into a buffer on the host. Is this the way it should happen I would have expected the ReadFile call to cause the in interrupt.p  pSo here is my problem I have a GUI and HID that work well together. The HID can do I2C to another IC, and the GUI can tell the HID to do I2C just fine. Upon startup, the GUI reads data from the HID and gets a correct value say, 0x49. Opening a second GUI to the same HID does the same initial data read from the HID and gets the correct value say, 0x49 it should be the same as the first GUIs read. Now, if I go to the first GUI, and do an I2C read, the readback value is 0x49, which was the value that the 2nd GUI had requested from the HID. It seems that the HID puts this value on the in endpoint for all devices attached to it. Thus the 1st GUI incorrectly thinks that this is the correct value. p  pPer Jan Axelsons HID FAQ, every open handle to the HID has its own report queue. Every report a device sends goes into all of the queues so multiple applications can read the same report. I believe this is my problem. How do I purge this and clear the endpoint before the 1st GUI does its request so that the correct value which the HID does send per the debugger gets through I tried HidDFlushQueue, but it keeps returning False not working keep getting handle is invalid errors, although the handle is valid per WriteFileReadFile success with the same handles. Any ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 588 pWe currently are in a debate within our IT group over what the best practice is for handling the majority of all of our processes. Our IT director is pushing for everything to be event driven.  His reasoning is that is will save on resources and it is the best method for sending ship notifications, order validations, order processing, etc. p  pAnother developer and I dont disagree on saving resources but argue that we are no longer in control of the process.  If something breaks we can easily reflagqueue or scheduled processes to pick up the errored transactions or handle things like communication failures. p  pIn a perfect enivronment uses event driven processes all over would be great because you wouldnt ever have to check for anything.

Negative 588 pThe linux codefilecode command does a very good job in recognising file types and gives very finegrained results. The codediffcode tool is able to tell binary files from text files, producing a different output.p  pIs there a way to tell binary files form text files All I want is a yesno answer whether a given file is binary. Because its difficult to define binary, lets say I want to know if codediffcode will attempt a textbased comparison.p  pTo clarify the question I do not care if its ASCII text or XML as long as its text. Also, I do not want to differentiate between MP3 and JPEG files, as theyre all binary.p

Negative 588 pIm facing an extremely weird bug here and Im not really sure If Im following the right path to solving it or even how to solve it.p  pHere is the problem Im facing I start debugging a WPF application which uses log4net, NHibernate and LINQ to NHibernate, and when I try to get an Entity from the database my application and sometimes VS hang for a lot of time, and after a while an exception dialog opens showing a message containing the following information on a ContextSwitchDeadlock MDAp  blockquote   pThe CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x34fc1a0 to COM context 0x34fc258 for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination contextapartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid thisp blockquote  pI copied the code files to a new project and deleted the old project to see If I could make this message disappear, thinking it had something to do with my configuration. I started adding few things at a time to see what was causing it, and when I included log4net configuration code the bug appeared again.

Negative 588 pI am trying to debug somewhat strange problem in the device driver for the PCIe FPGA device. Both the device driver and the FPGA image are developed in the house.p  pThe target system is x86, and the OS is fedora 9. It has a PCIe card with the FPGA plugged in its only PCIe slot. The FPGA image is loaded after the boot from the EEPROM.p  pThe driver is written in such a way that it uses the sysbuspcidevices00000200.0 resource files where 00000200.0 is the PCI slot of the card containing the FPGA to configure the FPGA.p  pWhen the system boots or when it returns from the hibernation, the FPGA link seams to be lost, and the resource files are missing. When the FPGA boots properly, everything works fine the resource files are there. When the system enters the hibernation, the FPGA is powered off. When it returns from the hibernation, the FPGA is powered on, before starting the driver initialization.p  pI am suspecting at next things p  ul lia bug in firmware  something related to PCI plug inli lia bug in kernel  least likely, because other PCI cards are recognized fine. Onlybr                  this PCI card makes problemsli ul  pAnd the questions are p  ul liHas anyone had similar problemsli liWhat else could be wrongli liAny suggestions on how to debug this issueli ul  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI just found a hrefhttpsbugzilla.redhat.comshowbug.cgiid481474 relnofollowthis buga, which is very similar to the problem I am seeing.p

Negative 588 pGood afternoon.p  pI am unfamiliar with the activity life cycle in android and have been reading up as best as possible but I cannot figure how to solve the following in a nice manner.p  pI have an activity with a GLSurfaceView to draw various things on the screen. In the renderering thread for this GLSurfaceView I perform all the rendering as well as the actual update logic I will seperate this out eventually.p  pThe trouble I am having is from one of the screens drawn within the renderer I wish to end the Activity and have it call the various lifecycle methods. p  pNormally I might do this with System.exit0 however ending the activity in this way does not seem to call the OnStop OnDestroy methods.p  pThis might just be me being silly and not seeing an easy way of doing this but is there a way to access the Activity and call activity.finish without having to pass the reference to it all the way downp  pThis is probably less of an android question and more a general java problem Sorry I am a little rusty at both. Maybe if someone could explain roughly how they handle an issue like this in their app.p

Negative 588 pIve been looking into how to best organise my librariesclasses recently and Im yet to come up with a satisfactory solution. That and it would just be a whole lot cleaner to write codexyz  new XyzImplementationcode than codexyz  thisgtloadgtlibraryxyzimplementationcode. And it only gets worse with multiple instances, it seems pretty geared toward using librariesmodels as singletons.p  pWhy doesnt CodeIgniter just use codesplautoloadregistercode or codeautoloadcode itself I know that CI knows where its class files are so doesnt necessarily need to go looking each time a class is instantiated. Is it just a speed thing Andor keeping it lightweight If thats the case then I want to know what method is best to use to give CI this functionality, i.e. codexyz  new XyzImplementationcode.p  pIve tried a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgwiredesignzcodeignitermodularextensionshmvcwikiHome relnofollowHMVCa but dont like the fact that it basically scraps the core codeCILoadercode and reimplements each function. Ive gotta wonder what would happen if the contents of the core methods was to change.. I guess anyone using a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgwiredesignzcodeignitermodularextensionshmvcwikiHome relnofollowHMVCa would have to wait for it to be patched or patch it themselves on githubp  pIve come up with my own solution tonight but Im not sure its all that efficient. It basically uses codedirectorymapcode to find a class of the corresponding name e.g. codeXyzImplementation.phpcode anywhere below codeAPPPATHcode. Sounds horrible, right Once its found codeXyzImplementation.phpcode once, its location is cached in a file and just looked up next time around so once the siteapp has been through a bit of testing theres no reason why every instantiation wont be a lookup.p  pDoes that sound like a half decent solution Assume that codefindclasspathcode returns the full relative path to the found class file using a recursive directory lookup.p  precode ignore system classes ifCI  substrname, 0, 2  MY  substrname, 0, 2      return    read cache cache  array cachefile  APPPATH.cacheabracadabra.php classincache  false iffileexistscachefile      cachecontents  filegetcontentscachefile     ifemptycachecontents                          cache  unserializecachecontents         ifarraykeyexistsname, cache                      classincache  true             includeoncecache[name]                  class not in cache, find it in application ifclassincache       TODO be more restrictive than APPPATH     classpath  findclasspathname, APPPATH      TODO handle case where a class isnt found     cache[name]  classpath     fileputcontentscachefile, serializecache  add to cache     includeonce classpath    instantiate ifclassexistsname  so as to not instantiate interfaces      return new name  codepre

Negative 588 pIm currently in the initial phases of planning a rewrite for a large module in our CRM application.  p  pOne area I am currently looking into is database optimization, I havent made any decision yet but I just want to make sure I understand the concept of ROWOVERFLOWDATA properly  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms186981.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms186981.aspxap  pWe are using SQL server 2005, its my understanding that the row size limit is 8,060 bytes and that after that overflow will occur.p  pI ran a query to get my max row size for a particular read intensive databasep  precodeSELECT OBJECTNAME sc.[id] tablename , COUNT 1 nrcolumns , SUM sc.length maxrowlength FROM syscolumns sc join sysobjects so on sc.[id]  so.[id] WHERE so.xtype  U GROUP BY OBJECTNAME sc.[id] ORDER BY SUM sc.length desc codepre  pThis gave me a few tables with a maxrowlength that was sligtly above 8,000, but under 10,000.  Another query shows that the average row size is actually quite small, around 1,000 bytes.p  pMy question is is ROWOVERFLOWDATA based on each row or is it per column Once the 8,060 bytes limit is expanded is the entire column that caused it to overflow moved to another page or is it only the specific rowp  pSo for example given the following simplified schemap  precodecol1 int  col 2 varchar 4000  col 3varchar5000     1          4000 characters       5000 characters This row is overflowing     2          4000 characters       100 characters     3          150 characters        150 characters     4          500 characters        600 characters codepre  pWould every the col 3 of row 1 to 4 get replaced by a 24 bytes pointer or only rowID 1p  pI am wondering cause if its every row gets a pointer it becomes important to fix it, if its only a few rows maybe we can take the performance hit.p  pAlso, Ive seen many blogs suggesting to move nullable columns toward the end of the database so that if the values are in fact NULL they dont take any row space.  Is this true We tend to keep our timestamp and tracking columns at the end cause its easier to visualize.  Now I am wondering if maybe we shouldnt move them further up as they are never NULL.p

For example, in the companies table, there are names like Some Company Limited and SOME COMPANY LTD.p  pMy plan was to export the offending tables into R, convert names to lower case, replace common synonyms like limited  ltd, strip out nonalphabetic characters and then use codeagrepcode to see what looks similar.p  pMy first problem is that codeagrepcode only accepts a single pattern to match, and looping over every company name to match against the others is slow.

Negative 588 pI have a Windows Forms codeListBoxcode databound to a codeBindingListcode of business objects. The ListBoxs displayed property is a string representing the name of the business object. I have a codeTextBoxcode that is not databound to the name property but instead is populated when the ListBoxs selected index changes, and the TextBox, upon validation, sets the business objects name property and then uses codeBindingList.ResetItemcode to notify the codeBindingListcodes bound control the ListBox to update itself when the TextBoxs text value is changed by the user.p  pThis works great unless the name change is only a change in case i.e. name to Name, in which case the codeListBoxcode doesnt get updated it still says name, even though the value of the underlying business objects name property is Name.p  pCan anyone explain why this is happening and what I should do instead My current workaround is to use codeBindingList.ResetBindingscode, which could work for me but may not be acceptable for larger datasets.p  pstrongUpdate 9272011strong Added a simple code example that reproduces the issue for me.

Negative 588 pI have an app where I need to have two tableviews swapped in and out by once view controller. I currently have it set so the viewcontroller is the delegate and datasource to both, so I use if  else statements in the delegate  datasource methods to determine which tableview to perform the action on like belowp  precode NSInteger tableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection       if tableView  [self selectAnAlbumTableView]              return [[self albums] count]          else              return ceil[[self album] numberOfAssets]  4.0        codepre  pHowever, I saw this in another thread One method which I have often used is to actually have the delegates and data source for the two UITableViews be different objects. This way, your view controller doesnt have to switch back and forth, and your code is overall cleaner and simpler. My question is, how would you go about implementing something like this, ie separate objects for the delegate  datasource, and is it better than what Im currently doingp

Negative 588 pI do not see why we need codenilcode [1] when to codeconscode a sequence socalled proper list of items. It seems to me we can achieve the same goal by using the socalled improper list codeconscodeed pairs without an ending codenilcode alone. Since Lisps [2] have already provided a primitive procedure to distinguish between a codepaircode and an atom some implementations even provide codeatomcode, when defining a procedure on a list, e.g., codelengthcode, I can do the same with just dottedpairs, as shown belowp  precodedefine len   lambda l     cond pair l  1 len cdr l           else 1    codepre  pIt is obvious that we can apply this procedure to an improper list like code1 . 2 . 3code to get the expected answer code3code, in contrast to the traditional codelength 1 2 3code.p  pId like to hear any opinions in defense of the necessity of codenilcode. Thanks in advance.p  p[1] Lets ignore the debate among codenilcodecodeNILcode, codecode and codecode.p  p[2] Here it means the Lisp family of languages.p

Negative 588 pI have a method that can potentially make a lot of calls to a database when validating a list of entities using Hibernates default traversable resolver. If I annotate it Transactional, it runs nearly four times faster.

Negative 588 pI am trying to get COM to start my outofprocess .NET COM server.  It works if the server process is compiled with x64, but if I use AnyCPU which is what I want then it hangs for a while and eventually fails with 0x80080005 COESERVEREXECFAILURE.  How can I get this to workp  ul liI am running on a 64bit machine Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008 SP1.li liI can see in Task Manager that it does start my server.  So I guess the problem is in the communications between COM and the server class registration.li liMy test client application is written in C, but it doesnt matter whether it is compiled for x86 or x64.  The problem also occurs with something written in 32bit C.li liIf I rebuild the server using x64 and run it, and then rebuild back as AnyCPU, then COM can start it.  A reboot will take me back to the original situation.  Perhaps COM doesnt know in advance what bitness is going to be used, and a previous execution helps.li liI found a hrefhttpwww.andymcm.comcat17Andy McMullens blog posta and tried passing CLSCTXACTIVATE64BITSERVER to CoCreateInstance, but that triggers a failure earlier 0x80040154 REGDBECLASSNOTREG.  Am I doing something wrong in my COM registration  You can see below that it is very simple.  Registration occurs when running in 64 bits, and the problem occurs when the client is 64 bits, so Wow6432Node should not be involved.li ul  pAnother chap has had a a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsdaDKnetfx64bitthreadb140309ed2824a9290a3131600d0b256similar problema, but the MSFT answer is confusing.  He seems to be suggesting it can only work via DCOM see link or COM.  I suspect either will be an awful lot of work, and substantially worse than distributing my .exe built as x64 and x86.p  pYou may be wondering why I am implementing IPersistFile.

Negative 588 pI have a UITableView inside of a UIScrollView.p  pWhile this isnt ideal, it was necessary since I wanted to put another custom view on top of the table, which is scrolled off using the scroll view. The table view is used in many different parts of my app and would be great to keep it encapsulated and reusable.p  pThe problem now is that because I no longer utilize the scrolling of UITableView itself it is sized big enough to display all its cells, and then placed inside the scroll view, I lose the ondemand loading of cells. This makes for unacceptable performance when my table view has more than a few cells.p  pWhat is the best way to set up something like this without losing dynamic cell loadingp  pThe only way I can think of is making the whole thing a table view, and making my top custom view just another cell. But this would mean I cant as cleanly reuse my UITableView.p

Negative 588 pI was trying to understand what I could from jQuerys animation functions, but ended up running into all sorts of internal functions I didnt understand, and ultimately landed on isWindow. The code for isWindow checks to see if an object has the property codesetIntervalcode, and returns false otherwise.p  pOf course, any object could have the property codesetIntervalcode without being the window, and although it would almost have to be a deliberate attempt to sabotage jQuerys functionality to have an object with that exact property name, I can imagine some reasonable cases where it could be unintentional. p  pIs there not a better way to check if an object is a window object Couldnt they use something along the lines ofp  precodeobj.setInterval ampamp obj.setInterval.toString  function setIternval [native code]  codepre  pI know the return of codetoStringcode of an internal function isnt going to be standard across all browsers, but the writers of jQuery seem to have a great understanding of these crossbrowser differences. Im also aware that this isnt a foolproof method either, as someone could easily override the codetoStringcode method to return that same string, but this would still prevent the problem of having an object mistaken for a window. p  pI wouldnt ask if I thought that codeisWindowcode was only used on internal objects by jQuery, but it was part of codeisPlainObjectcode, which is used in code.extendcode, which can be used on external objects. p

Negative 588 pI want to set up an SSH gateway for me and a couple of others. Being authorized with this gateway server, should mean access to any target server.p  pThis is so far easily done by installing a public key into all target servers, and placing the nonpassword SSH key in all users home directory on the gateway server.p  pHowever I dont want anyone to be able to take the SSH key with them. It should be locked onto the gateway server, and not viewable by other than the SSH and SCP client utilities to authorize with targets.p  pIs there any possible way to secure the private key, kind of like good old DRM locking software to a given PCp  pThanksp

Negative 588 pI have a java swing based UI which I use to monitor a filesystem folder.

Opens the web app page. Browses and selects the local filesystem folder which needs to be monitored. Over the hours as the new files are added to the local folder, they are shown in the web interface and get uploaded onto the server.p  pMy question is what all technologies can i use to implement this. I already have the HTMl based web Ui ready. I now need to monitorsync a selected local folder. what all do i need to do that. I remember there was something created by google which allowed a background process to monitor folders.p  pregardsp

Negative 588 pIm running a MapReduce task on Gzipped .arc files. Similar to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8999734hadoopconvertingrntonandbreakingarcformatquestiona, Im having difficulties as the Gzip decompression is running automatically since files have a .gz extension, but it is causing issues on newlinecarriagereturn being rendered as just newline as per Unix file encoding. This makes the input completely unreadable since it depends on specific character counts embedded in the file. I am trying to disable the Gzip decompression so I can do it instead in my mapper, correctly. I have triedp  precode jobconf stream.recordreader.compressionnone codepre  pBut that doesnt seem to affect the compression. Is there any way I can prevent Gzip decompression on my inputp  pThanks, Geoffp

Negative 588 pUsing Windows Identity Foundation asp.net, mvc 3, I set the cookieHandler config in web.config like so p  precode    ltcookieHandler requireSsltrue domain.website.qa gt codepre  p.qa is our quality assurance and testing build domain. Locally, I have it set top  precode    ltcookieHandler requireSsltrue domain.website.local gt codepre  pAnd this worked fine. I needed to override domain from default because the auth cookie needed to be seen across different subdomains e.g. asdf.website.qa and qwer.website.qa. The local builds are just that, locally run from the developers computer. QA builds are pushed to a server. Firefox and IE were ok with this domain, but Chrome didnt seem to set the cookie at all. The problem was fixed by changing the QA site to be asdf.website.qaa, andp  precode    ltcookieHandler requireSsltrue domain.website.qaa gt codepre  pIs there a feature in Chrome that blocks two letter top level domains on cookies Or am I thinking about this incorrectlyp

Negative 588 pI am currently needing to validate that a checkbox list is a required field as well a number of text boxes on the page. I am using the .net RequireFieldValidator to do so but when choosing control to validate the checkbox list is not in the list of available controls. I have dont plenty of research to correct this issue and I keep seeing that I need to extend the validation class into a custom validator control. The project I am working on is throw away work due to an upcoming site rewrite. Is there a faster way of getting this same validation to occur still using the RequiredFieldValidator. p  pI am currently updating a textbox that has a border of 0 and forecolor set to white so it is basically hidden without it being hidden since once you hide the textbox the validator no longer works with the SelectedIndex.ToString of my checkbox list and then validating that textbox as required instead of the checkbox string.p  pThis seems a really round about way of doing it and cause a postback every time a checkbox is checked or unchecked and quite frankly is a complete hack to get it to work.p  pAny help would be greatp

This is what I wish to be using in my ideal goal. Not what I am using right now.. It was done in MS Excel 2010, using Columns ABF and Row 1993p  pemCurrentlyem my format for working code, I am using manually implemented Arrays.. For example for the iName I havep  precodechar iName[16][25]  Scorpion, Poring, Hornet, Familiar, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null codepre  pDefined in a header file bSystem.h now to apply, lets say their health variable I have to have another array in the same Header with corresponding order, like sop  precodeint HP[16]  1109, 50, 169, 155, 95, 95, 118, 118, 142, 142, 167, 167, 193, 193, 220, 220 codepre  pThe issue is, there is a large amount of data to hard code into the various file I need for Monsters, Items, Spells, Skills, ect.. On the original small scale to get certain system made it was fine.. I have been using various Voids in header files to transfer data from file to file when its called.. But when I am dealing with 1,000 Monsters and having to use all these variables.. Manually putting them in is kinda.. Ridiculous Lol...p  pemPart 2emp  pNow my ideal system for this, is to be able to use the .CSV Files to load the data.. I have hit a decent amount of various issues in this task.. Such as, converting the data pulled from Names to a Char array, actually pulling the data from the CSV file and assigning specific sections to certain arrays... The main idea I have in mind, that I can not seem to get to is thisp  pI would like to be able to find a way to just read these various variables from the CSV file... So when I call upon the variables likep  precodecout ltlt name ltlt  ltlt health ltlt  health VS.  ltlt iName[enemy] ltlt  ltlt HP[enemy] ltlt  health codepre  pwhere code[enemy]code is, it would be the ID.. the enemy encounter is in another header lSystem.h where it basically goes likep  precodecase 0         enemy  0 codepre  pWhere 0 would be the first data in the Arrays involving Monsters.. I hate that it has to be order specific.. I would want to be able to say enemy  1002 so when the combat systems start it can just pull the variables it needs from the enemy with the ID 1002.. p  pI always hit a few different issues, I cant get it to pull the data from the file to the program.. When I can, I can only get it to store int values to int arrays, I have issues getting it to convert the strings to char arrays.. Then the next issue I am presented with is recalling it and the actual saving part... Which is where part 3 comes in 3p  pemPart 3emp  pI have attempted a few different things so far and have done research on how to achieve this.. What I have came across so far is..p  pI can write a function to read the data from lets say mobDB, record it into arrays, then output it to a .dat So when I need to recall variables I can do some from the .dat instead of a modifiable CSV.. I was presented with the same issues as far as reading and converting..p  pI can go the SQL route, but I have had a ton of issues understanding how to pull the data from the SQL I have a PowerEdge 2003 Server box in my house which I store data on, it does have NavicatSQL Premium set up, so I guess my main 2 questions about the SQL route is, is it possible to hook right into the SQLServer and as I update the Data Base, when the client runs it would just pull the variables and data from the DB Or would I be stuck compiling SQL files... When it is an online game, I know I will have to use something to transfer from Server to Client, which is why I am trying to set up this early in dev so I have more to build off of, I am sure I can use SQL servers for that If anyone has a good grasp on how this works I would very much like to take the SQL route..p  pAttempts I have made are using like, Boost to Parse the data from the CSV instead of standard libs.. Same issues were presented.. I did read up on converting a string to a char.. But the issue lied in once I pulled the data, I couldnt convert it..p  pIve also tried the ADO C route.. Dead end there..p  pAll in all I have spent the last week or so on this.. I would very much like to set up the SQL server to actually update the variables... but I am open to any working ideas that presents ease of editing and implementing large amounts of data..p  pI appreciate any and all help.. If anyone does attempt to help get a working code for this, if its not too much trouble to add comments to parts you feel you should explain I dont want someone to just give me a quick fix.. I actually want to learn and understand what I am using. Thank you all very much p  pChrisp

Negative 588 pI have an app that loads images dynamically with JavaScript and draws them to a canvas.

Negative 588 pIs it a good OO programming practice to create a method in a base class that would know about a derived classp  pFor example consider the classes A, B, C, D where class B inherits from A and classes C and D inherit from B. Consider now a method that is common to all classes that inherit from A including A itself and which needs to know about class B in order to work eg the relative distance of objects of class ABC or D from an object B. Since this method is common for all classes A, B, C, D it sounds logical that it should be placed within class A. However in this case we would have a method in the base class that would know of a derived class.p  pExamplep  precodeClass A   simple coordinate system     distancetocomplexcoordinatesystem B complexCoord           return complexCoord.distancetosimplecoordsystemself         Class B extends A   complex coordinate system     distancetosimplecoordinatesystem simpleCoord            do calculations         Class C extends A  Class D extends A  ... codepre  pIn the above example codedistancetocomplexcoordinatesystemcode is a method that all simple coordinate systems namely A, B, C, and D should have and the implementation is exactly the same for all of them. It is not an abstract class, and therefore should not be overridden.p  pDoes this make sense in an OO viewpoint and if it does is it really a good programming practice If not, any suggestions on how to avoid this will be highly appreciated.p  pTo my point of view it is not a good practice but I cannot find a nice way to avoid it without unnecessarily duplicating code. btw although probably not important  Im using Perl.p

Negative 588 pPlease see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7755661embeddedecllisperrorhandling7755661a first. I am using ECL and basically want to execute some code, trap any kind of condition that may occur and then continue execution, without prompting or entering the debugger. This is easy to achieve with the following handlercase macrop  precodehandlercase   load code.lisp  this may raise a condition    error condition     print condition  this prints sth like lta UNBOUNDVARIABLEgt codepre  pMy only problem is that I cannot find a generic way to print a more meaningful error for the user. Indeed my application is an HTTP server and the output goes to a web page. code.lisp is written by the user and it can raise any kind of condition, I do now want to list them all in my code. I would just like to print the same error message I see on the REPL when I do not use handlercase, but in the HTML page, e.g. for an unbound variable error, a string like The variable VAR is unbound.p  pBy inspecting a condition object of type codeUNBOUNDVARIABLEcode I see it has two slots codeSIREPORTFUNCTIONcode, which is a compiled function and codeSINAMEcode, set to the name of the variable in this case. I guess codeSIREPORTFUNCTIONcode could be what I need to invoke but how can I call it If I tryp  precodehandlercase foo error condition SIREPORTFUNCTION condition codepre  pit tells me that SIREPORTFUNCTION is undefined. SI or SYS in ECL is a package for functions and variables internal to the implementation, but I dont worry if my code is not portable, as long as it works.p  pBTW in other kinds of condition objects there are also other apparently useful slots for my purpose, named codeSIFORMATCONTROLcode and codeSIFORMATARGUMENTcode, but I cannot access any of them from my code too.p  pI was looking for somethink alike to the codegetMessagecode method of Java exception objects in Lisp, but none of my sources ever mentions something like that.p  pMoreover, is there any hope to be able to get the line number in code.lisp where the error occurred too Without that it would be difficult for the user to locate the problem in his code.lisp source file. I would really want to provide this information and stopping at the first error is acceptable for me.p

Negative 588 pI am using the HTML5 canvas element and the new HTML5 file io function to drop multiple files on it and have them upload. It works fine, but now I need to generate a new filename if no files are in the destination directory Its a 7 digit integer or get the name of the last uploaded file, convert it to int32 and increment that by one for every new file being uploaded to the same directory. This is where the codeGetFileNamedircode comes in. The first image always uploads fine but the problem begins once the second file is saved and the process hits ImageJob.Build, I presume this is because once the new file is starting to write, the GetFile method runs for second file in line simultaneously and is  checking for last written file, which is still being written and this creates the conflict. How can I fix this, maybe I can somehow itterate with a foreach over the Request.InputStream data or implement some kind process watch that waits for the process to finishp  pstrongcodeUpdatecodestrong I tried using TempData to store the generated filename, and just increment on the int value in TempData for all the next file names and it appears to do better, gets more images in but still errors at some point. But TempData is not for that as it gets erased after each read, reassigning to it again does not help.

Negative 588 pI have a wcf service, it is async and use the net tcp binding. Until now, it works fine. I can get the metadata, generate the proxy class for the clients... etc.p  pHowever,, I need to define a message contract because I need to send files to the service from the client. This class is in a common library, where also I have the STEs self tracking entities.p  pAlso I add the new async method in the service that let me send files.p  pMy message contract is the followingp  precode[MessageContract] public class FileDataStream  IDisposable      [MessageHeaderMustUnderstand  true]     public string Name get set      [MessageBodyMemberOrder  1]     public System.IO.Stream DataStream get set  codepre  pIf I use this class, when I try to get the metadata in the same way that I follow in the past, now in the internet explorer says me that the page cant be found. The client cant connect. And If I use netstat ona  find 7997 I get nothing, so the service is not running correctly.p  pHowever, if in my message contract class I delete the messagecontract attribute, the all works fine. When I mean that all works fine is because the service is running correctly.p  pHowever, the binary information of the file does not arrive correctly to the service. In the examples that I read about the transfer of files in WCF, I always see that a message contract is used, because to send more information, like as the name of the file, the message contract is needed.p  pSo I would like to know what I am doing wrong. In other situations, when I cant get the metadata, is because I dont have the binding correctly set, but I dont know if I need an special configuration when I want to use a message contract.p  pMy service cofiguration is the followingp  precodeltconfigurationgt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt     ltbindingsgt         ltnetTcpBindinggt         ltbinding nameServiceDocumentos maxBufferSize2147483647                       maxReceivedMessageSize2147483647 maxBufferPoolSize2147483647                        transferModeStreamed closeTimeout000100                        openTimeout000100 receiveTimeout002000                        sendTimeout000100 maxConnections100gt           ltsecurity modeNonegt           ltreaderQuotas maxArrayLength2147483647 maxBytesPerRead2147483647 maxStringContentLength2147483647gt         ltbindinggt          ltbinding nameServiceCore maxBufferSize67108864                       maxReceivedMessageSize67108864 maxBufferPoolSize67108864                        transferModeBuffered closeTimeout000100                        openTimeout000100 receiveTimeout002000                        sendTimeout000100 maxConnections100gt           ltsecurity modeNonegt           ltreaderQuotas maxArrayLength67108864 maxBytesPerRead67108864 maxStringContentLength67108864gt           ltreliableSession enabledtrue inactivityTimeout002000 gt         ltbindinggt       ltnetTcpBindinggt           ltbindingsgt      ltservicesgt       ltservice behaviorConfigurationCMMSService nameGTS.CMMS.Service.Servicegt          ltendpoint bindingnetTcpBinding bindingConfigurationServiceDocumentos                  nameServiceDocumentos contractGTS.CMMS.Service.IServiceDocumentos          addressServiceDocumentosgt         ltendpointgt          ltendpoint address ServiceCore                  bindingnetTcpBinding bindingConfigurationServiceCore                  nameServiceCore contractGTS.CMMS.Service.IServicegt         ltendpointgt          ltendpoint addressmex bindingmexHttpBinding contractIMetadataExchange                  listenUriModeExplicitgt         ltendpointgt          lthostgt           ltbaseAddressesgt             ltadd baseAddresshttplocalhost7997CMMSService gt             ltadd baseAddressnet.tcplocalhost7998CMMSService gt           ltbaseAddressesgt         lthostgt         ltservicegt     ltservicesgt     ltbehaviorsgt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt         ltbehavior nameCMMSServicegt           ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledfalsegt           ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultsfalse gt           ltdataContractSerializer maxItemsInObjectGraph2147483647 gt            ltserviceThrottling                     maxConcurrentCalls64                     maxConcurrentInstances2147483647                     maxConcurrentSessions50gt         ltbehaviorgt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehaviorsgt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pThanks.p

Something appears to be wrong with the click.p  pAny insight into how to repair this would be very appreciated.p  pHeres the code for the accordion sectionp  precode    ltdiv classspan4 offset1gt     lth2gtNoteslth2gt     ltdiv classaccordion idnoteaccordiongt          for note in user.notes.all reversed              ltdiv classaccordiongroupgt                 ltdiv classaccordionheadinggt                     lta classaccordiontoggle noteheader well datatogglecollapse hrefnote note.id gt                        note.title    note.date ltagt                ltdivgt                 ltdiv idnotes note.id  classaccordionbody collapse if forloop.counter0  0  in endif gt                     ltdiv classaccordioninnergt                         ltdivgt                                 ltpgt note.copylinebreaksbr ltpgt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                ltdivgt                  endfor                  ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pp

Negative 588 pMy webpage displays realtime data that is updated every 10 seconds from our PI serverhistorian server. I was recently tasked to take two peices of data that are allready displayed on my page and  divide them, displaying the new result on a graph. I have very little experience with AJAXJQuery, so I was wondering if someone out there can lend me a hand p  pClarificationp  pHypetheticallyp  pSay I have Number of Grades and Sum of Grades displayed on my page as basic integers. They are updated every 10 seconds from the server. I want to take those two pieces of live data, divide them, and display the result in this case it would be the overall average  grade. So, my page will display Number of Grades, Sum of Grades, and Average Grade all updated in real time, every 10 seconds.p  pI am unclear as to whether JQuery can simply take those values off the server and perform division on them and return a value, or if other steps need to be taken to achieve this. Im completely shooting in the dark here so sorry in advance for any vagueness or lack of required information.Thank you.

Negative 588 pI have an issue which I assume is CSS, but I cannot seem to find the fix for it.  I am using a WordPress theme the site can be viewed here a hrefhttpsencb.com relnofollowhttpsencb.coma.  Everything functions as intended, unless the screen size is somewhere sub 1050px wide.  I know most modern monitors are much wider than that, but this is still a fix Id like to find.  The problem, when the screenbrowser window is smaller in width, usually somewhere around 1050px, the whole scrolling content side the right side shifts left over the fixed area and navigation menu.  Ive tried just about everything I can think of, so I am in hopes someone here can find the fix.  Thanks in advancep

Negative 588 pIm an iOS developer making the jump to Android to port a project Im working on and I appear to be failing to grasp a few concepts on Androids custom BaseAdapter. Im working on an app that parses XML from a site and populates the text from the XML elements into a ListView. I have the XML parsing portion down with no problem. The problem I run into is with adding a button to each row in the list view. I understand the concept of setting the OnClick Listener and that I need to implement a BaseAdapter, but I cant seem to get my data from my main activity to the class I have setup that contains my BaseAdapter. Right now the data does not show up when the app is launched. Ive performed some debugging and verified that the data from the menuItems ArrayList is sent properly to the BaseAdapter class, Im just not getting how to get it displayed in the ListView. Its probably something really small I think Ive just looked at it for too long and am not seeing it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Id like to change this name, so I can easily identify the machine from the workstation GUI.p  pThe code Im using isp  precodeamp vmrun clone path to master vm.vmx path to new vm.vmx linked snapshot01  attempting to change the display name here results in an error vm not started amp vmrun start path to new vm.vmx gui amp vmrun writeVariable path to new vm.vmx runtimeConfig displayName new display name codepre  pUnfortunately, this code does not update the VMWare workstation GUI. Using the readVariable command I can read out the new value.p  pIm considering writing some Powershell to update the .vmx file directly, but just feel there has to be a better way.p

Negative 588 pstrongContextstrong  p  pIve often been in situations where our ASP.NET pages would have to show data to the user on a GridView, let him change it as he pleases Textbox on cells and only save it to the database when he actually hits the Save Button. This data is usually a virtual state of the information on the page, meaning that the user can change everything without really saving it until he hits the Save Button. In those cases, theres always list of data that needs to be persisted across ASP.NET Postbacks. This data could be an instance of a codeDataTablecode or just some codeListltSomeclassgtcode. p  pI often see people implementing this and persisting the data on codeSessioncode. On that cases i also usually see problems when it comes to some user navigating with multiple tabs open, some times on the same page. Where the data of two different tabs would get merged and cause problems of information being scrambled.p  pExample of how Session is often usedp  precodeprivate ListltSomeClassgt DataList      get              return Session[SomeKey] as ListltSomeClassgt          set               Session[SomeKey]  value       codepre  pPeople often tries to solve it by doing something like thisp  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      if IsPostBack              DataList  null          else              FillGridViewDataList       codepre  pBut what about when two tabs are already loaded and the user is changing the GridView values and for some weird reason he tries to save the data by hitting the Save button on the other page I personally dislike this option.p  pOther ways to do this would be to put the data on codeViewStatecode. However, when it comes to persisting substantially big lists, it could impact the page heavily when its stored on the page codeHiddenFieldcode.p  pBut, whats the best way to make that work Once, i thought in using codeSessioncode together with codeViewStatecode where the codeViewStatecode would hold an unique identifier which would index the codeSessioncode saved data. That would prevent sharing the data between tabs on the browserp  precodeprivate ListltSomeClassgt DataList      get              if ViewState[SomeKey]  null                      ViewState[SomeKey]  Guid.NewGuid.ToString                   return Session[ViewState[SomeKey].ToString] as ListltSomeClassgt          set           if ViewState[SomeKey]  null                      ViewState[SomeKey]  Guid.NewGuid.ToString                   Session[ViewState[SomeKey].ToString]  value       codepre  pOn the other hand it would store a new list of data to the Session every time the user enters the page. Which would impact the server memory. Maybe they could be erased in some way.p  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pWhat would be the best way of persisting that kind of data across Postbacks, considering the contexts of multiple tabs on the browser, with the less cost to the server and to the maintenance coding teamp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAs nunespascal nicely posted, one option would be to store the codeViewStatecode in the codeSessioncode using the codeSessionPageStatePersistercode. But unfortunately thats not an option on my case. And yet it is not very different from my last example, saving the data on the Session indexed by an UniqueId stored on the ViewState.p  pWould there be any other optionsp

Negative 588 pI am attempting to build a small web application but Im not clear how to communicate between different parts of the page. I will use my specific functionality to demonstrate my question.p  pAll of my pages use a generic toolbar. Since this toolbar is used on multiple pages, it is in its own PHP file, which I include usingp  precodeltphp include..toolbar.php gt codepre  pThe toolbar includes a log in button. When clicked, this opens a modal login dialog in this case the Facebook login dialog. When a user logs in, his or her name is displayed in the toolbar, and the log in button is replaced by a logout button. Since this behavior is the same no matter which page the user is viewing, I created a toolbar.js file to display the log in modal and update the usernamebutton appropriately.p  pHowever, on most pages, logging in or out from the toolbar needs to also update the contents of the main page. I can not guarantee that every page that includes toolbar.php will have to do anything when the log in status changes, but most will.p  pSimilarly, the reverse is possible  a certain page might have a log in button outside the toolbar. When this is used, the toolbar needs to update.p  pWhat is the best way to handle thisp  pCurrent implementation  this might be awfulp  pIn toolbar.js I am basically calling a function, userSignedIn, whenever the user logs in and an equivalent for log out. toolbar.js, implements this itself it needs to update its button and user name label.p  pThen, if the main page lets call it mainPage.php needs to anything additional, I am reusing this same function to tack on the additional actions. On load of that page, I do the followingp  precodevar originalUserSignedIn  userSignedIn userSignedIn  function      originalUserSignedIn     customUserSignedIn  codepre  pcustomUserSignedIn is a function within mainPage.js, where I perform the additional actions. I have not yet implemented a solution for the opposite sign in from mainPage.php needs to update toolbar.php.p  pI guess coming from an objectiveC background, I am attempting something analogous to calling super in a method implementation.p

These are all numeric values.

Negative 588 pBased on recent feedback and findings on this problem, Ive rewritten the question to get rid of noise.p  pI have 2 separate code paths, one in Java Android, one and Python which accomplish the following for the purposes of negotiating a pairing between an Android device and a PythonDjango.p  pJavap  ul liGenerate a syncKeyli liHash a concatenated string of various values using the presharedKey including the syncKeyli liEncrypt the syncKey using a presharedKeyli liSend the Hash, encrypted syncKey, DeviceId and arbitrary variables to web serverli ul  pPythonp  ul liGet the presharedKey from the deviceIdli liDecrypt the encrypted syncKeyli liHash a concatenated string of various values using the presharedKey including the decrypted syncKeyli liMake sure the hash matches, which confirms that the syncKey was decrypted successfully, and that the deviceId holds the correct presharedKey.li ul  pNow this process works if I send the syncKey unencrypted. The final hash matches, which proves the deviceId has the correct presharedkey, however as soon as I add the endecryption into the process, the hash no longer matches, despite the fact that both the syncKey and concatenated string appear to match perfectly character for character from the debug output of both JavaPython.p  pOne quirk of the process is that a 256bit key is necessary for the AES256 encryption algorithm, so Im chopping the 512bit presharedKey in half. The alternative of using only a 256bit key across the board was requiring that I pass the key through codeencodeasciicode on the python side, or else it was throwing up errors during hashing with the shorter key.p  pHere is the relevant codep  pJavap  precodeString presharedKey  getKey  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd0c1c8e36fddba501ef92e72c95b47e07f98f7fd9cb63da75c008a3201124ea5d  String deviceId  getDeviceId  1605788742789230  SyncKey syncKey  generateSyncKey  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  String concat  syncKey.hexString  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  String ALGORITHM  HmacSHA256 String hash  null try      SecretKeySpec keySpec  new SecretKeySpec         presharedKey.getBytes,         ALGORITHM     Mac mac  Mac.getInstanceALGORITHM     mac.initkeySpec     byte[] result  mac.doFinalconcat.getBytes     hash  Base64.encodeToStringresult, Base64.DEFAULT      FpDE2JLmCBrrWnjBHH13F8AV80sUM2fQAY2IpRs  catch NoSuchAlgorithmException x   catch InvalidKeyException x    String encKey  presharedKey.substring0, presharedKey.length  2  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd  int len  encKey.length byte[] encKeyBytes  new byte[len  2] for int i  0 i lt len i  2      encKeyBytes[i  2]  byte Character.digitencKey.charAti, 16 ltlt 4              Character.digitencKey.charAti1, 16   String encryptedSyncKey  null try      byte[] iv   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00      AlgorithmParameterSpec ivSpec  new IvParameterSpeciv     SecretKeySpec encKeySpec  new SecretKeySpecencKeyBytes, AES     Cipher cipher  Cipher.getInstanceAESCBCPKCS5Padding     cipher.initCipher.ENCRYPTMODE, encKeySpec, ivSpec     byte[] encryptedSyncKeyBytes  cipher.doFinalsyncKey.hexString.getBytes     encryptedSyncKey  Base64.encodeToStringencryptedSyncKeyBytes, Base64.DEFAULT              Yrl0SuTUUTC6oJ8o4TCOy65EwO0JzoXfEi9kLq0AOlf6rHnN7BEc0s5uE7TIo1UlJbDvR2Ca         ACmQVXXhgpZUTB4sQ0eSot32lg0EEb9xKI5CZ4l9QO5raw0xBn7rtfIdVm8AIFkN9QCcthS0DF         KH3oWhpwNStfEuibLPgGqPzGTozmido9U9lb4n       catch InvalidAlgorithmParameterException e   catch NoSuchAlgorithmException e   catch NoSuchPaddingException e   catch InvalidKeyException e   catch IllegalBlockSizeException e   catch BadPaddingException e    sendStuffToWebencryptedSyncKey, deviceId, hash codepre  pPythonp  precodehash  getHashrequest  hash from Java FpDE2JLmCBrrWnjBHH13F8AV80sUM2fQAY2IpRs  encryptedsynckey  getEncSyncKeyrequest  encryptedSyncKey from Java  Yrl0SuTUUTC6oJ8o4TCOy65EwO0JzoXfEi9kLq0AOlf6rHnN7BEc0s5uE7TIo1UlJbDvR2Ca  ACmQVXXhgpZUTB4sQ0eSot32lg0EEb9xKI5CZ4l9QO5raw0xBn7rtfIdVm8AIFkN9QCcthS0DF  KH3oWhpwNStfEuibLPgGqPzGTozmido9U9lb4n  deviceid  getDeviceIdrequest  1605788742789230  presharedkey  getPresharedKeyFromDevicedeviceId  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd0c1c8e36fddba501ef92e72c95b47e07f98f7fd9cb63da75c008a3201124ea5d  enckey  presharedkey[lenpresharedkey2]  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd  aes  AES.newenckey.decodehex, AES.MODECBC, IVx0016 synckey  aes.decryptbase64.b64decodeencryptedsynckey  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  concat  synckey  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  import hashlib from hmac import new as hmac  verifyhash  hmacpresharedkey, concat, hashlib.sha256.digest.encodebase64  IoSc2w2sQ4fwhJTdUQHwHdyjyranzQ1z3J5LfYbA codepre  pFrom the debug output below you can see the codesyncKeycode is encrypted and decrypted successfully, and the codeconcatcode is identical.

Negative 588 pIs preprocessing static resources through middleware using express a good idea for production environments From my understanding the middleware stack is run, in series, for every request. Wouldnt that mean then that preprocessing middle would regenerate a static resource ie somestyles.less  somestyles.css after every request If so, would it be better to simply preprocess through a build system such as grunt.js in advance and serve those files Id like the final rendering of the css and js to be concatenated to one file and minified.p  pAlso, is it worthwhile to prerender html from templates such as jade on pages with only static content Or is that more trouble than its worthp

Negative 588 pI a new to flask,python programming. I want to know whether this problem can be solved p  plet say I want to known whether a number is prime or not.  I have created a html webpage,it contain a textbox and a button field respectively. The user will give input from the html page as a front end. In the back end the flask will give the response that the number is prime or not. In the back end my python script has a function name prime which will decide the number is prime or not.  The result  will be displayed back in the html page.p  pIf this is possible please tell how to proceed.   p
Negative 588 pI have an app that synchronises content with a web server so that the app ends up with an offline and cut down version of the server based web pages. All text and html is stored in a SQLite database but what is the best approach for handling file assets In my case this is a mix of image and audio files. p  pThe synchronisation is all set up in the core project and my Touch project has a Content directory set up for storing the assets and my intention had been to have a similar setup for Droid. I could pass the list of files needed to the UI projects and download them from there but that seems wrong.p  pThanks.p

Negative 588 pI want to detect the movement of the hand dynamically and modify sound accordingly. The phone is in the hand in a fixed orientation which does not change. For Example, I am holding the phone in my stretched hand and as it moves to the right or left, my music volume changes dynamically If I move up and down the speed of playing changes and moving at some intermediate angle changes both speed and volume accordingly. I charted the accelerometer data while doing these motions and there seems to be some pattern but I am not sure how to filter those. I have looked at a lot of posts  High PassLow Pass filters, Kalman Filters, Gesture Recognizers but it is difficult to understand what is the appropriate method. Most of the posts dont seem to detect dynamically  but only when a certain gesture is finished. I only need to use accelerometer and not gyroscope and any other sensor. What is the correct approach here Are there any existing libraries that do thisp

Therefore I have this in a function.p  precodeNSLogDelegate Range   d,start,end,[start daysBetweenDateend]      self.dataArray  [NSMutableArray array]     self.dataDictionary  [NSMutableDictionary dictionary]      NSDate d  start     whileYES         for Event event in matches              if[event.evedate isEqualToDated]                   self.dataDictionary[d]  save event title in here                 [self.dataArray addObjectYES] place marker on date d               else                 [self.dataArray addObjectNO]  dont place marker                                 NSDateComponents info  [d dateComponentsWithTimeZonecalendar.timeZone]         info.day         d  [NSDate dateWithDateComponentsinfo]         if[d compareend]NSOrderedDescending break      codepre  pBut now Im looping 31 times amount of days off the month through my array of events. This is probably not the best practice solution  p  pI also think that the problem is that the time of the date is not the same. For examplep  precodeevedate gt 20130813 1200 d gt 20130813 1500 codepre  pSo I probably should use an NSDateformatter to only get the date itself without the time p  pAm I correct p

Negative 588 pOn a certain page under certain conditions I need to run an update statement in SQL on page unload.  It needs to be complete before the user reaches the next page.  Im using JQuery 1.8.3.  Heres where I startedp  precodewindow.unloadfunction      .ajax             type POST,             cache false,             url myScript.php,             data   my data  ,             success functionresult   do nothing  ,             error functiondata  location.reload        codepre  pUsing this method the update statement didnt run.  Through reading up on it I tried async false which didnt seem to fix my issue at first, until I checked my table and saw that the value was updating only after adding async false.  According to further reading, async false has been deprecated in JQuery 1.8, but is still working to execute the update statement.  The problem is the update statement doesnt finish executing until the next pages select statements are already completed, so the data is out of date unless the user refreshes the page.  Is this due to partial support for async false in 1.8, slow execution of write to db vs fast execution of read from db, some other latency issue, or   Is the next HTTP request possibly going through even though the unload event is keeping the user on the pagep

Negative 588 pI need to increase computation speed of MATLAB code. For this purpose I rewrite my program on C language with Intel IPP library for operations with vectors. And here I got a problem after some step main computation circle program in MATLAB and my C program go to different pathes of algorythm. It is happened because computations not absolutely equal and my program accumulate error in compare with MATLAB computations results. For this reason, my program doesnt compute correct gradient and the whole optimization algorythm doesnt count well. So I got a computation speed increase, but lost computation efficiency  when on 100th step MATLAB compute optimization error on 0.004, C program compute on 0.05 and this is important in my task.p  pI checked what function give me error, and what I found common operations like ippsAdd64fA53, ippsSub64fA53, ippsMulf64A53, ippsDiv64fA53 and usual C operations  ,,, make equal to MATLAB results and sum error is zero, but math.h hyperbolic functions give a sum error on array with 75699 elements about 3..5e13.

Negative 588 pmy questions apply both to wso2 identity server 4.5 IS and to balana standalone.p  pI successfully process XACML multiple requests sent to the entitlement service in IS the web service interface to the PDP as ruled in the XACML v3.0 Multiple Decision Profile Version 1.0.p  pI have found in the web several examples of a custom attribute finder but in all those examples the implementation retrieves the attributes of the subject e.g the role of the subject and not of the resources. In my use case I would send to the PDP a xacml request with all the attributes of the subject and a list of resource ids. I have implemented an attribute finder to retrieve the attributes of the resources from an external system for example a database or a web service. strongThe first question is is this approach not recommended for same reasonstrong p  pstrongThe second question concerns the performance of this AttributeFinder implementation if the number of resources increases.strongp  pLets suppose we have limited the list of the attributes of the resources that can be used in the policy definitions. For example a small number of attributes.p  pThe method from org.wso2.balana.finder.AttributeFinderModulep  precodepublic EvaluationResult findAttributeURI attributeType, URI attributeId,             String issuer, URI category, EvaluationCtx context  codepre  phave to return the valuevalues of a single attribute. So, if a policy evaluates more attributes for a resource this method is called more times for the same resource. I could avoid to call the external system multiple times for different attributes of the same resource if I read all the attributes of the resource at the first call of that method  and save that data e.g. on a thread local variable that can be used for the subsequent calls. p  pSo, if I have a multiple request and a policy on the attributes of the resources applies to that request, the method is called more times not only for every attribute  of the same resource, but also for every resource. To improve the performance I would like to reduce the number of calls to the external system hence I would like to read at the first call of the method findAttribute the attributes for all the resources or a subset if I have a very large set. To do that I need access in the findAttribute method to the list of all the resource id in the request. The EvaluationCtx I receive in the attribute finder is only one of those in the Set that is built from the multiple request. The full set is processed cyclically in the method org.wso2.balana.PDP.evaluateEvaluationCtx and is not available in the method findAttribute.p  pI could for example extend the PDP class to publish in a thread local variable the full Set of EvaluationCtx or the list of resources id but this could work in a balana standalone and not in the wso2 Identity server. Any ideasp  pThank you. Stefanop

Negative 588 pLet me start by saying that I know the difference between .ajax asynctrue an false, AND that I understand that it is GENERALLY not advisable to use synchronous calls.  With that said, I think I have a situation that calls for using asyncfalse. p  pThe basic problem is that I need to click a link or button...or anything and have the form data saved and when it is finished saving I need a new TAB opened in my browser we use Chrome. This sounds simple, but the issue I have is that if I use a callback with .ajax and asynctrue I have to use location.open and that opens a new window in chrome. This not acceptable to my end users. ALL other links open in new tab.. p  pHeres where I am stuck...  If I call the asynctrue ajax onClick of a link, but dont use a callback, I just return true, It works and opens in a new tab. But I have no guarantee that the data was saved in time for the new window to render the report base on it. So I switch to asyncfalse, and then I can make sure it works BUT it opens a new WINDOW not a TAB.  I certainly dont want to just loop and wait until the asynctrue returns... p  pWhat can I Dop  pHere is the html Linkp  precodelta idbtnSampleForm hrefReportPdftemplatexyz..... targetblankgtSample Form ltagt codepre  pHere are my two codes functions.

Negative 588 pI have been playing with LXC for the past few days and was wondering it is indeed possible and how do I make it workp
Negative 588 pI have a candidate model and a bunch of other models such as schools, degrees, skills, job positions, etc. that have a one to many relationship with the candidate model.p  pI was able to make a create form form that creates a new candidate that can have form fields dynamically created using javascriptjquery. The user can add more input fields by clicking a Add Another Button. The form submits to the controller and all the data gets added perfectly fine to the database.p  pThe problem comes into play with the edit form. The edit form is pretty much the same as the create form except it has data pre populated in the form fields from the database. When I submit this form to the update function in the controller it does the update incorrectly. When  I go back to the edit form to see if it worked correctly, there are random input fields with blank values but the data does get edited.p  pI am fairly new to the play framework and probably am doing something wrong. I did something similar in PHP using Codeigniter and it worked fine. Probably because Codeigniter doesnt use Ebean or JPA.p  pBelow is some of the code that I wrote so my question is more understandable. Im only going to include the Candidate model and the Schools model because the other ones are similar to the schools model. Also, I included the js code that generates the dynamic form fields.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  precodeCandidate.javamodel      Entity     public class Candidate extends Model       Id

Negative 588 pAs the title suggest, I need help to create a database. What kind of database of database doesnt matter, I just need it to workp  pThe program is a musiclist which you can add songs, remove songs, and edit songs.p  pI have been programming for about a month, so I would appreciate if you could also explain how the database methods works etc. instead of just give me the answer .p  pThe database needs to store the data of 3 ArrayLists. The 3 arraylists all store Strings, and I connect the arraylists using an index of a JListModel.p  pThe functions that I need isp  ul liStore the 3 Arraylists to an database. Probably its a problem that the arraylists are connected with Index like songindex 1, artistindex 1 need to be stored together.li liI need to be able to remove from the database at a specific index.li liI need to be able to edit from the database, at a specific index. I need to be able to call content from individually arraylists for instance get content from songindex 5, so add all 3 arraylist to 1 string isnt an option.li ul  pIm not sure its a good idea use 3 arraylists to store the data, so if theres any better alternatives, I would be glad to know p  pWhen I call the data from the database, the data should be called to the method addString. This method takes 3 strings, and add them to the same index. So I guess the database shouldnt contain any kind of index.p  pThe edit method is found in editSong, and the remove method is found in ite.addActionListener.p  pThe 3 array is fl, which contains song

Negative 588 pI have an assignment that asks us to code an automatic change program for a dollar input up to 200.00. Basically, someone inputs an amount and the output displays that amount in change for the various following denominations how many 20s, 10s, 5s, 1s, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Ive worked out a way to do this with ifelse statements for each denomination see below, but I was wondering if there was an easier, more condensed way to execute this with loops its an intro course, so were not yet at functionsarrays, etc.p  precodeint twenties    int tens int fives int ones int quarter int dime int nickel int penny double dollarent  printfPlease enter a dollar amount up to 100   scanflf, ampdollarent printfName  Assignment 2  ChangeOMaticnn printfAmount entered  .2lfnn, dollarent   twenties  dollarent  20 if twenties gt2     printf.0dt20.00sn, twenties if twenties  1     printf.0dt20.00n, twenties else     printf codepre  pThanksp

Use Google to search for emman strcpyem a hrefhttpwww.google.com.ausearchqman20strcpy relnofollowclicka and the first search result should be at linux.die.net. When I click on that link, itll take me to the website and highlight both emmanem and emstrcpyem on that target page. Is works when using Google, Bing, Yahoo.p

Negative 588 pI have a java application running with jersey on appengine. I recently upgraded to jersey 2.6 in order to use the new HK2 AOP feature.

I tried the following to disable the tagp  precodea.onclick, functione     e.preventDefault    .attrhref, null codepre  pbut it is not working.p  pThe problem is definitely on the codeltagtcode tag. If I change it into a codeltspangtcode in DevTool, everything works just fine. But the codeltagtcode is generated on runtime, so I cannot change it on my end. p  pWhy would they use a codeltagtcode tag at such a place The off state is wrapped by an codeltspangtcode, why they used a codeltagtcode for on statep  pIs there any way to disable the behavior of codeltagtcode I can definitely copy the generated HTML and replace my input,then change the codeltagtcode to codeltspangtcode...but then whats the point of using jQM Maybe I should just switch to Bootstrap 3...p  pstrongEditedstrong emSolvedemp  precodea.onclick, functione     e.preventDefault     e.stopPropagation      return false  codepre  pstopped behavior of codeltagtcode but did not entirely solve the problem. This will cancel the default click effect on the flipswitch.p  pTried dave s solution, p  precode.optionmain ul li input[typecheckbox].eachfunction             this.flipswitch                 create function event, ui                        .uiflipswitchon.eachfunction                           this.replaceWithltspan class                               this.attrclass                               gt                               this.html                           ltspangt                                                      , defaults true          codepre  pNow all the a tags are cancelled, everything works well. Flipswitch is initialized dynamically. After these I also called code.parentselector.createcode to force the flipswitchs trigger the create method. This last step is not necessary, depends on if your flipswitch is rendered correctly.p

Negative 588 pThe following member function of the class codenetcode has the purpose to solve a network of nodes from the class codenodecode.

Negative 588 pIm working to write an AngularJS SPA. As Im a bit new to the framework, I keep on having errors when I run through the app and I see that an exception is thrown in the console. However, I largely find these exceptions to be remarkably useless as they dont tell me where the problem is occurring e.g. file, type of provider or line number. The Chrome console simply shows me over to line 36 of the angular.js file which doesnt help.p  pIf Ive made changes to a number of files since the last run through, it becomes a haystack hunt looking for what exactly Angular is getting happy about.p  pFor example, I seem to have referenced the dependency for rootScope somewhere, but who knows where exactly it is. Heres my current exception URL a hrefhttperrors.angularjs.org1.2.1524injectormodulerrp0homeampp1Error3a205B24injector3aunpr5D20httperrors.angularjs.org1.2.1524injectorunprp02524rootScope0A20202020at20Err relnofollowhttperrors.angularjs.org1.2.15injectormodulerrp0homeampp1Error3A205B24injector3Aunpr5D20http3A2F2Ferrors.angularjs.org2F1.2.152F24injector2Funpr3Fp03D2524rootScope0A20202020at20Errap  pAm I doing this wrong Is there some tool I dont know about that simplifies this whole javascript development process substantiallyp  pEdit Per the answer I received, I worked out the problem was me referring to another service incorrectly and had nothing to do with rootScope. And I only figured this out after commenting out rootScope across the entire application and finally getting an error that said the name of my function in it. Then I took that and looked up every instance of it in my logic until I found the problem.p  pBut this seems wildly inefficient. Surely theres a better way than commenting out large chunks of the program simply to cut down on all the places where the problem might be lurkingp

Negative 588 pI am in a need of hiding the console window, which I quickly resolved by PInvoking ShowWindow. However, the call hides the console window as well as the taskbar button of the console window. I need the taskbar button to remain visible. I am not, however, looking for a way to minimize the console window. Clicking the taskbar button show not do anything. I tried to use SetWinEventHook and hide the window every time it was activated, but to no avail, as the window calling this function must run message loop in order to receive the events and my console window didnt, no matter if I set OutOfContext or InContext flag.p  pIs there a way I can make my console application run, show itself in taskbar, then hide itself or never show itself in a first place and just keep running with no window but taskbar button visiblep

Negative 588 pI have some custom logic I need to insert into CDbCommand, CDbTransaction amp CActiveRecord classes that comes with the Yii framework. I cant replace them because I am using the same framework files for other projects.p  pMost of my models are already generated and is extended from CActiveRecord. I know I can easily switch them to my own custom class extended from CActiveRecord. However, the methods that I want to override in CDbCommand would not be filtered into CActiveRecord if I extend the CDbCommand class, and in addition CDbCommand is used by many other Framework classes. I need all other framework classes to use my overrides of CDbCommand methods.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 588 pI am using a pandas DataFrame to store data from a series of experiments so that I can easily make cuts across various parameter values for the next stage of analysis. I have a few questions about how to do this most effectively.p  pCurrently I create my DataFrame from a dictionary of lists. There is typically a few thousand rows in the DataFrame. One of the columns is a deviceid which indicates which of the 20 devices that the experimental data pertains to. Other columns include info about the experimental setup, like temperature, power, etc. and measurement results, like resonantfrequency, bandwidth, etc.p  pSo far, Ive been using this DataFrame rather naively, that is, I use it sort of like a numpy record array, and so I dont think Im fully taking advantage of the power of the DataFrame. The following are some examples of what Im trying to achieve.p  pstrongFirststrong I want to create a new column which is the maximum resonantfrequency measured for a given device over all experiments call it maxfreq. I do this like sop  precodedf[maxfreq]  np.zerosdata.shape[0]   create the new column for index in np.uniquedf.deviceindex     group  df[df.deviceindex  index]     max  group.resonantfrequency.max     df.maxfreq[df.resonatorindex  index]  max codepre  pstrongSecondstrong One of my columns contains 1D numpy arrays of a noise measurement. I want to compute a statistic on this 1D array and put it into a new column. Currently I do this asp  precodenoiseest  [] for vals,freq in df.noise,df.resonantfreq     noiseest.appendvals.std1e6freq df[noiseest]  noiseest codepre  pstrongThirdstrong Related the the previous one Is it possible to iterate through rows of a DataFrame where the resulting object has attribute access to the columns I.e. something likep  precodefor row in df     row.noiseest  row.noise.std1e6row.resonantfreq codepre  pI know that this instead iterates through columns. I also know there is an iterrows method, but this provides a Series which doesnt allow attribute access.p  pI think this should get me started for now, thanks for your timep  pedited to add df.info, df.head as requestedp  precodedf.info  df.head looks the same, but 5 nonnull values  ltclass pandas.core.frame.DataFramegt Int64Index 9620 entries, 0 to 9619 Data columns total 83 columns Amag                                       9620  nonnull values Amagerr                                   9620  nonnull values Aphase                                     9620  nonnull values Aphaseerr                                 9620  nonnull values .... totaldacatten                             9600  nonnull values roundtemp                                  9620  nonnull values dtypes bool1, complex1284, float6439, int6412, object27 codepre  pI trimmed this down because its 83 columns, and I dont think this adds much to the example code snippets I shared, but have posted this bit in case its helpful.p

Negative 588 pIm desinging a web based game.

Negative 588 pIm starting to look at integrating the Google Drive SDK into Android. I need full access for my users, which it appears the Android SDK doesnt support, so I started following the instructions at this link a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdriveandroidauthconnectingandauthorizingwiththegoogleapisjavaclient relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comdriveandroidauthconnectingandauthorizingwiththegoogleapisjavaclientap  blockquote   pIn some cases, applications may need to use the Google Drive web   service to access additional features or access broader scopes than   what is available in the Google Drive Android API. In these cases,   your application must use the Google APIs Client Library for Java.p blockquote  pSo I started integrating the code sample belowp  precodeGoogleAccountCredential credential  GoogleAccountCredential.usingOAuth2this, DriveScopes.DRIVE credential.setSelectedAccountNameaccountName Drive service  new Drive.BuilderAndroidHttp.newCompatibleTransport, new GsonFactory, credential.build codepre  pI also followed these instructions p  blockquote   pTo install the Google API Java Client, you must download two ZIP   files, extract them, and then copy the JARs into your Java classpath.p      pDownload the Google Drive Java client library, which is bundled as a   ZIP file with all the required dependencies. Extract the ZIP file Add   all of the JARs within the libs directory to your classpath. Add the   googleapiservicesdrivev2[version].jar jar to your class path.p blockquote  pTheres some problems though I can only see one zip file per version in the downloads area, and it doesnt include the googleapiservicesdrivev2[version].jar.p  pIm not able to compile the code, and get errors like DriveScopes cannot be resolved to a variable. I added the Google Play Services jar but that didnt help, either. I looked at related answers to this question, but they appear to apply to earlier versions of the SDK, and I dont feel comfortable about downloading an old beta jar from a Maven Repo. p  pWhat is the recommended way today to integrate Google Drive into an Android application, but with full access This seems more complicated than it needs to be and I hope Im just missing something really obvious.p

Negative 588 pI managed to set up modh264 on IIS 7 working just fine, pseudo streaming is working great. I cant get jwplayer pseudo streaming to work with a httphandler inbetween. I mean the video starts from the beginning whenever you click in a different position  if I remove the handler the pseudo streaming works as expected. My problem here is to prevent people gaining direct access to my videos I dont care if they save the video via browser cache.

Negative 588 pIm currently looking for a solution that will prevent a user from making multiple requests at the same time. I would like the first request to finish before the I process the second request from the user. For example, lets say user adam liked and unliked suzys photo. Both unliking and liking of the photo happens in the same view. p  pCurrently the problem that Ive been having is that Im processing both requests at the same time. In the case of the like view, when a user likes something, I create a likeobject. When the user decides to unlike something, I check for the existence of the likeobject in the database and then delete it. HOWEVER If the first request hasnt finished yet, the check for the likeobject in the second request will come back saying there is no like object and it will create a second likeobject.p  pOnce all of this is finished processing, I will end up having 2 likeobjects for the same photo from the same user. This is bad.p  pTo give you more information, I use Gunicorn as my HTTP server. I run 3 regular workers, which is why each request is processed at the same time. p  pSo what do you think I could do I mean, I was thinking for using Celery and RabbitMQ for this. Each request will be submitted into a queue and be processed asynchronously. Thats one option. But I feel like that might be overkill in a situation like this. Im looking for something that can be done directly within Django. Hmm, let me know of the possible solutions. p  pThanks p

Negative 588 pI have a class with three arbitrary codefloatcode values stored in it. Lets call them A B and C. The class has a method that will take an input float in the range of 1 to 1 and then return a value based on the input.p  pcalling the method with value 1 will result in the value of A, calling it with 0 will result in B, calling it with 1 will result in C. The question now is, how can i interpolate an output for everything in between p  pI was thinking of an imaginary curvespline based on three points defined as  1xA 0xB and 1xC. With a function that can plot this curve, providing output for any float in the range can be calculated. p  pNB p  ul liThe exact form of the curve isnt that important, but it must never provide an output higher than the highest of A B or C, nor can it provide an output lower than A, B, or C. As I need to test it to see what works best, I cannot say if the curve has to be smooth at all.li liThere is no restriction as to which of the stored float values is higher or lower. Two of them might even be the same.li liAt first i was thinking of using the three points to define a circle, however this could result in output values outside of the range of A B and Cli ul  pNormally I would post some code here to illustrate what i have so far, but as I dont really know how to attack this problem I do not see any point in posting just an empty function definition.p  pPSp  pIf someone is curious why, I am using input from a controller to define the angle of a joint, so the output value will never be outside the range of 180 to 180p

Negative 588 pIm using a hrefhttpbit.ly1qNNGDf relnofollowthisa Bootstrap plugin for a work project so yes, the code will be heavily censored when I put it here.  The plugin takes JSON objects, created in ColdFusion 10, and puts them into HTML tables.p  pI basically have a table that has, separated, two columns that are just checkboxes, assigned and complete.  The plugin erases the contents of the th tags, ie codeltthgtCompleteltthgtcode and puts a checkbox in that field.  The plugin creator has indicated that Im basically on my own to solve this problem, using the example at the link given earlier.p  pSo.  Ive assigned ID tags to the th telements, ie codeltth datafieldASSIGNED idassigned dataformatterchkBoxFormatter datatitleAssigned dataaligncenter datavalignbottom datasortablefalse datacheckboxtruegtAssignedltthgtcode and am trying to use jQuery to grab those elements, just the th box itself, leave the rows alone, so I can derp with this myself.  assigned doesnt work, and Im wary of nthchild selectors and etc., because, if a subsequent developer rearranges the column order, it would break.  Im hoping for a solution that is much harder for future developers to break.p  pFWIW, this is with the latest versions of jQuery and Bootstrap, with Modernizer loading into the browser but as of yet unused Im getting to it  Im not opposed to adding jQueryUI, if it helps, but were shying away from jQuery Mobile for reasons that are beyond the scope of this post.  Oh, and these are in  tags because the plugin requires it.p  pYes, Ive tried Googling, and reading the official jQuery docs, but the solutions presented are either ancient or seem too brittle.p  pstrongTLDR versionstrong I want to select specific th tags and force text into them.p

Negative 588 pEDIT see at the end for new investigations on the subject.p  pIve been experiencing an odd behavior with my shaders. In short, I find it very strange that to pass a single float from a vertex shader to a fragment shader I have to pass also a fake variable, and I am looking for an explanation of this behavior.p  pIn more details  I wrote two minimalistic shadersp  ul lipa vertex shader that passes one float only one, this is important, codevertAlphacode, to the fragment shader, like sop  precodeversion 150  uniform float alphaFactor uniform mat4 cameramodel in float vertAlpha in vec3 vert in vec3 vertScale in vec3 trans out float fragAlpha  void main      fragAlpha  alphaFactor  vertAlpha     glPosition  cameramodel  vec4 trans   vert  vertScale , 1.0f   codepreli lipand a fragment shader that uses the passed variablep  precodeversion 150  in float fragAlpha out vec4 finalColor  void main     finalColor  vec4 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, fragAlpha   codepreli ul  pBut that doesnt work, nothing appears on the screen, it seems that in the fragment shader, fragAlpha keeps its initialization value of 0, and ignores the passed value.p  pAfter investigating, I found a hack to solve this. I found that the fragment shader sees the passed value for fragAlpha only if a fake unused value is passed with it depending on the platform osx  NVidia GeForce 9400, Windows laptop  Intel HD Graphics, a vec3 or a vec2 is sufficient.p  pSo this vertex shader solves the problemp  precodeversion 150  uniform float alphaFactor uniform mat4 cameramodel in vec3 vertFake in float vertAlpha in vec3 vert in vec3 vertScale in vec3 trans out float fragAlpha out vec3 fragFake  void main      fragAlpha  alphaFactor  vertAlpha     fragFake  vertFake     glPosition  cameramodel  vec4 trans   vert  vertScale , 1.0f   codepre  pI find this more like a hack than a solution. What should I do to solve this properlyp  pIs there a perdriver manufacturer minimum threshold in terms of size of data that can pass from a vertex shader to a fragment shaderp  pEDITp  pAfter reading derhass comment, I went back to my code to see if I was doing something wrong. p  pAfter more investigation, I found that the problem is not inherent to the fact that I pass the attribute value to the fragment shader. I changed the order of attributes declarations in the vertex shader and saw that the attribute that has the 0 location location returned by glGetAttribLocation is not updated by a call to glVertexAttribute, its value stays at 0.p  pIt will occur for example for the trans attribute if it is declared before all other attributes. Introducing a fake attribute in my shader only fixed the issue because the fake attribute took the location 0.p  pIn any case, glGetError returns no error anywhere.p  pI use glDrawElements to render, with a vbo that contains the vertex positions, maybe Im using it inadequatly... or its not well supported by my hardwaresp  pTo give some more context, I copy here the calls i do to opengl, for setup and renderingp  pSetupp  precodeGLuint vao, vbo      glGenBuffers1, ampvbo     glGenVertexArrays1, ampvao  glBindVertexArrayvao  glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vbo   GLfloat vertexData[]         X     Y     Z     0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f,  0     1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f,  1     0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,  2     1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,  3     0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,  4     1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f,  5     1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,  6     0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f   7  glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, sizeofvertexData, vertexData, GLSTATICDRAW  GLint vert  glGetAttribLocationp, vert glEnableVertexAttribArrayvert glVertexAttribPointervert, 3, GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, 0, NULL glBindVertexArray0 codepre  prenderp  precodeglUseProgramp  aphaFactor  glGetUniformLocationp,alphaFactor glUniform1falphaFactor, 1.0f  cameramodel  glGetUniformLocationp,cameramodel glmmat4 mat  gCamera.matrix glUniformMatrix4fvcameramodel, 1, GLFALSE, glmvalueptrmat   glBindVertexArrayvao  GLubyte indices[36]       3, 2, 6, 7, 6, 2, 6, 7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 4, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 1, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4   GLint trans  glGetAttribLocationp, trans GLint alpha  glGetAttribLocationp, vertAlpha GLint scale  glGetAttribLocationp, vertScale  loop over many entities glVertexAttrib3ftrans, mvInstTransData[offset], mvInstTransData[offset  1], mvInstTransData[offset  2] glVertexAttrib1falpha, mvInstTransData[offset  3] glVertexAttrib3fscale, mvInstTransData[offset  4], mvInstTransData[offset  5], mvInstTransData[offset  6]  glDrawElementsGLTRIANGLES, sizeofindices  sizeofGLubyte, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, indices end loop                  glBindVertexArray0 codepre

Negative 588 pI have to do a project that tries to scan the shape of the vehicles and detect what type of vehicle it is , the scanning will performed with a sensors called vehicle scanner they are just 50 beams of lights, each beam with receptor and emission as it is shown in the picture p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0HW7Q.jpg altenter image description herep  pI get from the sensors the raw sate of each beam block or unblock and with that continuous scanning we can create a probably very low res image of the vehicle. p  pMy question is what algorithmstechnique I can use to detect and identify the shape of the vehicle, we want to count the wheels, and if we can, try to identify if that shape is a car or a truck or pickup etc., at least we want to count the wheels.p  pI am considering training a neural network, but perhaps could be a simpler approach for this kind of pattern detection that I can use and I am unaware of. Any other suggestionadvice will be much appreciatedp

Negative 588 pI wanted to migrate the datatables from Oracle to neo4j.p  pEarlier I tried with MySQL to Neo4j migration in Neo4j 2.1.2 version using batch import, but could not achieved. Someone suggested to downgrade the neo4j version from 2.1.2 to 2.0.4. When I downgraded the version and tried using batch import i was able to migrate the data from MySQL to neo4j. In this case first i was creating the Nodes and Relationships table and exporting them as a csv file and then loading the csv files using Batchimport utility into Neo4j database.p  pNow i wanted to migrate the data from Oracle database to Neo4j. Here i dont want to export export the nodes and relationships to any file . I wanted to directly load the data from oracle to Neo4j.p  p1How can i do it p  p2If using Batchimport do we need to follow the same procedure which I have done for MYSQL to neo4j migrationp  p3Which version of neo4j i should go for , 2.0.4 or 2.1.2 p  pThank youp

Negative 588 pThis is more of a conceptual question than technical pertaining to Java. Ive noticed lately programmers tend to avoid creating classes to pass data around and simply move it using codeJSONObjectcode if available or a basic codeHashMapcode. A lot of new interviewees choose to use what I call a JavaScript method of coding. So instead of creating class called codeAddresscode, they would store it all in codeJSONObjectHashMapcode and pass it around as Object later casting to appropriate type. Also I notice a lot of p  precodetry  ...   finally  return str   codepre  pstructured methods.p  pIs this something normal and accepted these days To me, it just goes against everything I was thought in school. I mean, no generalization, no encapsulation, etc... And when asked, they claim codeJSONObjectcode is encapsulation. Well, not disagreeing, but just not something expected. p  pThe task is always being done in the end, but the way its done is disturbing to me. This kind of practice produces a lot of loose structures with a lot of potential errors if programmers are not careful. Wasnt java generics created to avoid exactly thatp  pFeel free to move this question to other exchange, but Id really like to hear some opinions from seasoned folks.p

Negative 588 pI have an SVG file with a network diagram rectangle with arrows connecting the rectangles. It is much larger that the browsers viewport. The logical starting point when reading the diagram is at a rectangle near the center of the diagram.

Negative 588 pIve made basic apps before but Im very very new to using MAT in Eclipse for Android. Im not sure if the following is a problem or not so Im really just looking to see if this is something I eventually need to fix.p  pWhat is happening is Im launching my app for the very first time and it heads to its MainActivity. Immediately after this, without interacting with the app again, Ill use MAT in eclipse to dump an HPROF file. Ill then look at its Histogram and filter it so that it only shows MainActivity stuff. This is where I get confused. I see multiple MainActivitys listed but each with a dollar sign and number at the end of it. Basically, I see the following in the Histogram listp  precodeClass Name                        Objects       Shallow Heap class.example.MainActivity        1              160 class.example.MainActivity1      1              8 class.example.MainActivity2      1              8 class.example.MainActivity3      1              8 class.example.MainActivity4      1              8 class.example.MainActivity5      0              0 codepre  pThe funny thing is MainActivity5 has 0 objects in it so Im not sure why its even listed. When I look at the objects inside each of them, they all show different objects that each are from different classes. Im sure this is a complete beginner question but is this badp  pWhen I press Update Heap on the DDMS and then try Cause GC to do some garbage collecting, I dont see any changes as far as my memory goes. Ive also never gotten an Out of Memory error.p  pIm hoping this is a simple question for people who are familiar with these kinds of things. If theres something wrong or concerning about the app, Ill definitely try to hunt down the problem on my own. For now, Id just like to know if this is something I should be looking into as a possible issue. Thanks for any help.p

Negative 588 pI am working with a MS Dynamics Nav Database that have a file attachment tables. The files are stored in MS SQL. I am able to pull the files to my desktop with a custom asp.net application that I have built, but when I open the files, they are corrupted. These are PDFs files that are located in the image file type column of the database and I have tried to download over 20 files. All of them varies in size and seem to download successfully.br The reason why I suspect these are PDFs files is because the column right next to the binary columns give me the name of the file as in PDF format. I have also tried to renaming the file after I download to different image formats but without any luck when I tried to open it.   This is not my first project to retrieve binary files, from MS SQL database.  If anyone work on getting files off the Nav database before, please help me. The sample code below I wrote to retrieve files using LINQ to SQL when I give it a specific ID in the browser.  Please advice me if you know any sort of compression or encryption in the binary files itself and how to grab the file successfully to read it.

values will update as they update in the dynamic table. To preanswer any questions I have tried it outside of the looping function and the same thing happens. When I use the JS fiddle it works, however when I use it on mine it only filters tables when there are 0 tables with what is typed in the box. It is not recognizing the VM names in the table.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDOxqF.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combCltj.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGKxqa.png altenter image description herep  pIm trying to dynamically hide table rows tags that are passed to a function as a list. Then you loop through this list and compare lowercase letters typed in the textbox name vmfilter if the letters typed in the text box match the name it will hide all other tables without that name.p  pfor example our list of vm names is p  precodetest 1, test3vm, highlife, millerlight, beer, nitromilk stout codepre  pstrongemand a user types memstrongp  ponly strongtest3vm, millerlight, and nitromilkstrong will show because they have an m. I also need to convert the list names to lower as it loops. p  pI will preface this with I really suck at JavaScript to my attempt is only half complete and probably way out to lunch.. This function is started after all the data has been properly displayed and runs on a 200ms intervalp  pThis is my attempt but it doesnt actually work it will hide some of the  fields but it doesnt reconstruct them correctly, and it doesnt match correctly. I need it to remove the fields because there is still table white space when it removes them.p  precodefunction checkForMatchstring,array     var arrKeys  array.length     var match  false     var

Negative 588 pIm learning that segmentation in operating systems is based on dividing different segments for a program, these could represent a symbol table, the source text, the stack... into units that start at logical memory address 0.

If I send this request with no headers at all, it returns a 200 status and a response containing the expected You need a key to access this information. If we try it on hurl.it, the GET request with a valid key as a header returns the expected results.p  pBecause of CORS, its running the preflight OPTIONS request, which I think is whats giving the 405 error, but shouldnt the server accept OPTIONS methods How do we ensure this method is accepted Is there something else going on that Im not catching CORS is a new concept to me so feel free to ELI5 your answers.p

Negative 588 pWe are currently working on a project to benchmark a program on different architectures. Most of the codebase is identical and an early version runs on all architectures.

We noticed that optimizations good for one architecture are detrimental for the second one and decided to keep the architecturespecific changes in a name branch with current head P.  D introduced some bugs which break unit tests, this was discovered after merging in M. To continue locally I reverted most of the changes in H and Commits B and H are almost identical. I am currently at head H and noticed that the changes introduced by B are already optimized for the architecture Im not working on.p  pI would now like to continue with the code from commit A, but make it as easy as possible to transplant further algorithmic changes to P.

Negative 588 pI looked at this page a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc301805.aspx relnofollowAn InDepth Look into the Win32 Portable Executable File Formatap  pIt explains that the linker needs an import library because the compiler cant distinguish between normal function calls and APIfunction calls. But they say also that declspecdllimport specifies a function call to be an APICall so the linker links against codeimp[emfunctionnameem]code. strongButstrong with this keyword the compiler should know that this is a call to an APIFunction.p  pWhy does the linker still need an import library The compiler could mark this symbol as imported by prepending codeimpcode to the function name and could make a call to a function pointer which is an unresolved symbol yet and the linker could replace this symbol because it sees that this an API call with the IAT entrys address.p  pAnd why can the MinGWlinker use MinGWDLLs directly but the VisualStudio linker needs an import libraryp  pAs I read the post some other questions were also raised. How does the dlltool or linker whichever creates the import library know the location of an IAT entry before linkage with the final executable has been done I thought the IAT entries would be constructed at linktime with the final executable. The post said, that every APICall has a fixed position in the IAT table, nevermind how many DLLs will be linked. I cannot imagine how that could be achieved. p

Negative 588 pstrongTLDRstrongp  pIs it possible to extract a value or parameter from a subreport within that subreports parent containing reportp  pstrongDescriptionstrongp  pI use a report with a subreport to display complex data about a bucket of countries. The subreport is inside a tablix which is associated with a dataset and receives a country code and some other parameters to display complex data about a single country. The parent report consolidates the individual country subreports and adds some static data like a cover sheet and table of contents.p  pEach subreport is several pages long and concerns a single country.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pId like to implement a footer on the main report which contains the name of the country on each page which displays country data. However, this is proving quite difficult to implement.p  pI cannot directly reference the dataset from the footer because it contains multiple rows one for each country, and I want to display the relevant country name for each page.p  pThere does not seem to be a practical way to get the country name or country code from the subreport.p  pIve also experimented with placing hidden text boxes inside the tablix and referencing the textbox using emReportItemem from the footer, but this has proven to be a problematic solution. Placing the text box above the subreport causes the country name to only be rendered on the first page of the subreport. Likewise, placing it below or to the right of the subreport causes the country name to only be rendered on the last page of the subreport.p  pIve also tried creating another column to the right of the subreport and placing the text box in there. This allows me to correctly render the country name on each page, however it causes a variety of formatting issues within the subreport, most seriously suppressing page breaks.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pRightly or wrongly, Im focusing on getting the country name or country code directly from the subreport, however Im open to other solutions for this problem.p  pstrongSample Datastrongp  pSample data from the parent report is a list of countries or countrylevel entities for the purposes of our report and associated parameters which are fed to a tablix containing the subreportp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrO67n.png altMaster Report Data Samplep  pSample data from the subreport is a list of line items pertaining to an individual country which are to be formatted and displayedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvli1g.png altSubreport Data Samplep

The DummyObject has a String name, an id and a rev.p  precode    String password  xxxx     CloudantClient client  new CloudantClientxx, xxx, password     Database database  client.databasemydatabase, false      DummyClass dummyobject  new DummyClass     dummyobject.setName         Response saveResponse  database.savedummyobject     String id  saveResponse.getId     String resultnew String     DummyClass loaded  database.findDummyClass.class,id     result  resultObjectloaded.getNamen Prints out garbage      result  resultUTF8new Stringloaded.getName.getBytes,Charset.forNameutf8n Prints most characters correct, except for some accented ones      InputStream inputStream  database.findid     DummyClass loadedFromStream  Json.fromJsonJson.parseinputStream, DummyClass.class     result  resultFrom StreamloadedFromStream.getName prints out fine      return okresult codepre  pBy retrieving the stream and using Jackson to deserialize, the output is correct, but then Id have to implement many of the provided methods for views, bulk document manipulation etc.p  pPerhaps the problem is in the LightCouch library, specifically here a hrefhttpsgithub.comlightcouchLightCouchblobmastersrcmainjavaorglightcouchCouchDbClientBase.javaL54020CouchDbClientBase.java relnofollowCouchDbClientBase.javaa, since that is the point that I have found differs between the two implementations emgetem as object and as stream. However, I do not know how to confirm, fix or work around it.p

IE if the user inputs 5,6,3,4,2 then the program will find the largest number, so 65432. p  pThe one catch is that since were only so far in the class, were not allowed to use arrays, strings, or loops.

Negative 588 pIn wxPython, Im having trouble centering a subpanel that Ive created to have a fixed aspect ratio.  p  pTo control the aspect ratio, the subpanel needs to capture the Size event and then do an explicit SetSize.

Negative 588 pI have an ODE for calculating how acidicity changes. Everything is working just fine, only I would like to change a constant whenever acidicity reaches a critical point. It is supposed to be some kind of irreversible effect I wish to simulate.p  pMy constants are coming from a structure file c I load once in the ODE function.p  precode[Time,Results]  ode15sx, c f1x, c,[0 c.length],x0,options codepre  pThe main problem I have here is not telling Matlab to change the constant but emrememberem if it happened already during the simulation once. so Matlab should take the irreversibly changed constant rather than the one I supply at the beginning.p  pI would like to write a flag that is saved while the ODE is running and an codeifcode condition, if flag exists, change constant. How to do thatp  pUPDATE I  PROBLEM SOLVEDp  pHere a first own solution, it is not polished and requires a structure file approach. Which means, the constants which should suddenly changed upon an event, must be struct files which are handed in the ODE function into the function that should be evaluated look above for the ODE syntax. The function accepts the inputs like this p  precodefunction [OUTPUT]  f1t, x, c   So here, the constants all start with c. followed by the variable name. because they are structs instead of globals   write a flag when that event happens  if c.someODEevent lt 999 ampamp exist flag.txt   0     dlmwrite flag.txt,1 end   next iteration will either write the flag again or not. more importantly, if it exists, the constant will change because of this.  if exist flag.txt   2         c.changingconstant  c.changingconstant2 end    end codepre  pPlease look into Horchlers kind answer where you have to take care that such a step may introduce inaccuracies and you have to be careful to check if your code does what it is supposed to do.p
Negative 588 pThis subject has been targeted in many discussions and yet we still see new ones showing up. My scenario is as followsp  pA Java framework running on a Linux server where UTF8 is the default character encoding in the JVM. The framework consists of some services receiving Tibco RV messages to be processed. And some of these messages contains non ASCII characters and are sent from a Windows server and ISO88591 is the encoding used when message are created. Now, when the data are extracted from the Tib rv message, the problematic fields arrives as Java Objects and needs to be cast to Strings... And here I havent yet been able to extract ISO88591 Strings containing the non ASCII characters swedish aring,auml,ouml to UTF8 String in a proper way.  I have tried using the following methodsp  precodeString isoStreet  new Stringresponse.getstreet.toString.getBytesStandardCharsets.ISO88591,java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF8 codepre  pand Ive also tried using the encodersdecoders within java.nio package with no success.p  pWhats also interesting is that Im using PuttY to connect to server where services are hosten and running. And from there I have the possibility to make a direct Tibco rv request from the shell using the tibcorvsend client and it seems like I need to set the remote character set to ISO88591 in PuttY WindowTranslation before signing in to server and make that Tib rv request  when this is done those noneASCIIcharacters are shown correct in the response, no matter what encoding I set in remote Linux server. Using export LCALLenUS.UTF8 or export LCALLsvSE.iso88591 doesnt matter in this case... only what remote encoding  I set in PuttY...p  pThsi should imply that the response message seems OK and at least the shell is able to output proper characters. But when inside Java VM using Java services I guess the response fields are quietly pushed into Strings when debugging and viewing the response Object not wanting this conversion to Strings  within Watch view... not sure if you could follow me on this, if not I may try to be more clear if needed...p  pAny input on this problem, anyonep  pRegards Rp

Negative 588 pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsappschangelog relnofollowFacebook is planning on discontinuing support for v1.0 of their API on April 30, 2015.a I dont know the details of how iOS codeSocial.frameworkcode is implemented, but is there a possibility that apps using codeSocial.frameworkcode on, say, iOS 6 to connect to Facebook will stop working after April 30, 2015p  pSome background codeSocial.frameworkcode was introduced in iOS 6 in 2012, so it is likely to be using v1.0 of the Facebook APIs, directly or indirectly. iOS 7 was released after the Facebook v2 APIs were released, but there is a possiblity that codeSocial.frameworkcode on iOS 7 is using the newer APIs, but it also possible it is still using older APIs. Has there been any official announcements from Apple or Facebook on this issuep  pI did some investigation and the version of codeSocial.frameworkcode on OS X is directly communicating with api.facebook.com over TCP. I presume the iOS version is similar. However, I wasnt able to determine what API version it is using. Perhaps someone who has done the hard work of network analysis knows the answer to this question.p

Negative 588 pI am trying to write a very basic text processor. the goal is to read from a file char by char and decide what type of token it is. basically what i have done is loaded all the chars into a queue and am using peek and read to check to see if the top element is for this portion a number, if it is append it to a string that will be used as a key in a hash map for different symbols. p  pby issue is in the following method. when the peek sees a number that char gets passed to this method along with the queue for further processing. the problem i am having is that when i start building the number as a string i am using the java matches with a regex to match only the numbers from 09, otherwise the method should stop building the string and return the lexeme object.p  pbut that is where my problem is. for example after it reads the 4 and then 2 it keeps adding all the chars from the queue after until the it is emptyand lumping it all in under the number instead of creating new tokens.p  pany guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 588 pIm experiencing problems with the d3 drag behavior. Variations of the issue Im having have been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19931307d3differentiatebetweenclickanddragforanelementwhichhasadragbehavioranswered beforea, but I couldnt find an answer to my specific problem.p  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netktbe7yh41 relnofollowHeres a fiddlea which illustrates the problem Im going to describe.p  pWhat I want to do is to have a click handler on a draggable element where the click handler shouldnt be executed on codedragendcode. I know that inside the click handler I can use coded3.event.defaultPreventedcode which should be set to true if the element was dragged. The problem arises when the codemouseupcode event happens on another element than the codemousedowncode event. This happens when the movement of the dragged element is slower than the mouse cursor. If the mouse is released and the dragged element isnt under the mouse yet coded3.event.defaultPreventedcode is set to false and the click handler doesnt get called. This makes it impossible to find out whether the codeclickcode event was fired after a drag or not.p  pIn my example the circle flashes green if the click handler executes but coded3.event.defaultPreventedcode was set to true. Also in the click handler propagation is prevented preventing the event to bubble up to the svg click handler. If the click handler of the circle doesnt execute and the event bubbles to the svg click handler the circle flashes blue if coded3.event.defaultPreventedcode was set to true otherwise it flashes red.p  pWhat I want to achieve is to get the circle to flash green or blue no matter where the circle is on mouse up in order to be able to know whether the click event happened after a drag or not. Is this even possible or is this a limitation by the nature of javascriptbrowsers If so is there a workaround Or do I just have to disable the slowing down of the circle when it is draggedp  pI found a very similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22649164alwayssuppressaclickeventafterdragind3questiona on SO but there wasnt really a useful answer.p  pAny help appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrong Looks like the idea to stop the element from slowing down during dragging solves the problem.

Negative 588 pI want to add my custom header to table view header in iOS app when user swipes the table down. So after the user swipes down and then releases the touch, the table bounces right back to newly appeared header. I tried to do it in the following wayp  precode voidscrollViewDidScrollUIScrollView scrollView  if scrollView.contentOffset.y lt 100.0     self.addHeader  YES  codepre  pThen I check when user releases the touch and add the headerp  precode voidscrollViewDidEndDraggingUIScrollView scrollView willDecelerateBOOLdecelerate  if self.addHeader  self.tableView.tableHeaderView  self.headerView   codepre  pThe table view decelerates right to new header so its ok. The problem is table view content jumps to its origin and then back when redrawing itself  it lasts only for some part of a second but its clearly seen. And if I put adding the header code in codevoidscrollViewDidEndDeceleratingUIScrollView scrollViewcode, the table view first of all bounces back to code0, 0code and only then moves down to make header visible.p  pIve also tried to put headerView as subview of table view and change codetableView.contentInsetcode to make it visible in codescrollViewDidEndDraggingcode, Ive tried to modify codetableView.framecode at that time, but no luck  table view jumps everytime I make any change in its frame or content offset.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 588 pI would like to know if there is a way to have some sort of input field in a Rails form, so that if the user enters code1, 2, 3code, then codeparams[model][attribute]code returns code[1, 2, 3]code or at least code[1, 2, 3]code, but not code[1, 2, 3]code.p  pBackgroundp  pI have a model codeFoocode, which has an attribute codebaridscode.

Negative 588 pI built an android app that is called from the browser precisely from an input type file element, this app will record a sound and after recording the app should return and set the path of the recorded file to the caller input type file. My android app is launched successfully, and records the sounds, the file are stored in the external sd card, and of course I can play the recorded files, the problem I have is that the app never returns the path of the recorded file, it returns a path of a file with a name generated by timestamp and other code, with JPG extension, and with 0 bytes of length, not sure why JPG I dont use camera for anything. I know that this solution will work only in Chrome starting some versions of Android, I need a solution like this. Can you please help me why it is returning a JPG file of 0 bytes instead of the path of the recorded file with extension 3gp, tell me what Im doing wrong.

Negative 588 pI built an autocomplete list of cities using a mysql query. Typing in the input field correctly initiates the search and builds the selectable city list. The problem is that the city name in full does not get saved, only the characters typed when using .onchange... I tried other mouse events such as mouseover, mousemove, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave  and they require the user to first select the item from the list, move out, then swipe the cursor over the input a second time to actually trigger the save of the selected city name.

Negative 588 pI want to be able to stream a radio station using python, in particular on a raspberry pi. Ive found lots of DIYs for raspberry pi radios, but most focus on bells and whistles like input dials that allow the device to mimic an actual radio.

In a lot of cases, the caller just expects an codeObjectcode so there was no implicit cast at all.p  pAs stated in the question above, the codeString.valueOfcode example worked fine in Java 7 because there was no type inference, hence codeObjectcode was assumed. Now in Java 8, the compiler chooses the most specific type here codechar[]code, which causes a codeClastCastExceptioncode at runtime.p  pThe problem is that we have around 350 calls of this codegetValcode method. strongIs there a way to detect overloaded method calls that would differ between Java 7 and Java 8strong I.E. detect when the Java 8 compiler would select a different method from the Java 7 compiler.p
Negative 588 pId like to write an AppleScript for replacing three system files with ones Ive modified.

Is it possible to write an AppleScript for replacing one file with another I ask because I know that when you replace a file, a dialog pops up with three options, and I dont know how to address that.p

This question is specifically asking about XQuery.p blockquote  pI have a web application that consumes rest services hosted in node.js.p  pNode simply proxies the request to XQuery which then queries MarkLogic. These queries already have paging setup and work fine in the normal case to return a page of data to the UI.p  pI need to have an export feature such that when I put a URL parameter of codeexportallcode on a request, it doesnt lookup a page anymore. p  pAt that point it should get the whole result set, even if its a million records, and save it to a file.p  pThe actual request needs to return immediately saying, We will notify you when your download is ready.p  pOne suggestion was to use codexdmpspawncode to call the XQuery in the background which would save the results to a file. My actual HTTP request could then return immediately.p  pFor the spawn piece, I think the idea is that I run my query with different options in order to get all results instead of one page. Then I would loop through the data and create a string variable to call xdmpsave with.p  pSome questions, is this a good idea Is there a better way If I loop through the result set and it does happen to be very large gigabytes it could cause memory issues.p  pIs there no way to directly stream the results to a file in XQueryp  blockquote   pNote Another idea I had was to intercept the request at the proxy node layer and then do an xdmpestimate to get the record count and then loop through querying each page and flushing it to disk. In this case I would need to find some way to return my request immediately yet process in the background in node which seems to have some ideas here a hrefhttpwww.pubnub.comblognodebackgroundjobsasyncprocessingforasynclanguage relnofollowhttpwww.pubnub.comblognodebackgroundjobsasyncprocessingforasynclanguageap blockquote

Negative 588 pIm using a sails.js backend, authenticating using passport, and an angular.js frontend. My app allows users to log in and their information is saved.

Im pretty new to this kind of programming and nothing online thus far is really helping me understand what it is I need to do. Can anyone provide an example or tell me what needs to be done to retrieve just the current, logged in user, rather than ALL of the usersp

Negative 588 pIm using Rs assertthat package and am wanting to temporarily output a warning instead of an error on assertion failure. Whats the easiest way to do that with the assertthat packagep  pI realize that wanting warnings instead of errors kind of goes against what assertions are supposed to be used for. In the long term, we indeed want to be outputting errors on assertion failure. In the short term, we still want the code to function even with bad input, since the output with bad inputs is still good enough for now. p  pA simple example suppose I have a function that takes x as input and outputs x5. I want to output a warning if x3. Since we will be using assertthat ultimately, it would be nice if we can use assertthat package for the warning.p  pIn the long term, well use thisp  precodegt x lt 3 gt fn lt functionx assertthatx3 returnx5 gt fn3 [1] 8 gt fn4  Error x not equal to 3  codepre  pIn the short term, heres the best I have so far p  precodegt fn lt functionx ifseeifx3 warningvalidatethatx3 returnx5 gt fn3 [1] 8 gt fn4 [1] 9 Warning message In fn4  x not equal to 3 codepre  pIm looking for a more concise solution, if possible best case would be passing an outputwarning parameter to assertthat, but I dont think that exists.p

Negative 588 pIve seen snippets of code in which a Java servlet initially connects to a MySQL database. In which case it uses the whole Class.forName method via the JDBC API. But, Ive also seen elsewhere that when the servlet connects to the database and executes a command it uses Runtime.getRuntime.execcommand string. These are two completely different methods but both seem to communicate with the database. Does the latter servlet connect to the database in the same way as the former and I just havent seen that part of the code Or, are there just two separate ways for a servlet to communicate with a database  Can both methods coincide one for setup and the other for common commands Or, can I run SQL commands with both the JDBC API or Runtime.execmethod as a matter of personal preference p

The args argument contains a list of strings which are to be used as command line arguments for the program named by prog. The run method executes the program, supplying the command line arguments. If the program, while running, reads from its standard input then that standard input is taken from the argument named input. The input argument is a list of strings each string represents one line of text input to be read by the program. When the run method returns, the result is either None for an apparently successful completion or a string which specifies a reason for the pro gram not executing or not completing successfully.

So when we want to disconnect a user we change his password, and after synchronization hes left out. p  pYet, he still can go to the webapps folder, find configs and thus connect to database not only client, but also server. So what I need is a way to deploy somehow encrypted codewarcodes to Tomcat.p  pAlso Id like to make Tomcat extract this codewarcode into somehow encrypted directory, for I sometimes make interface updates, and since clients have awful internet connections hence this overlycomplicated deployment structure, its important to update emonlyem files that need updating. p  pBut the last question is less important, since I can set tomcat to not unpack codewarcodes and make clients suffer huge downloads for updates workable, yet undesireable solutionp

Negative 588 pI am trying to understand some code from Vladimir Kolmogorovs excellent Graph cut library and I have a question regarding graph construction.

They have the capacity A. So if both these edges are cut, both x and y belong to the source node associated with label 0. So something likep  precode         s       x         y                                                                         t codepre  pNow for E0, 1, I will need another edge going from s to y also with capacity A, so now the Graph looks something likep  precode         s                                                       x         y                                                                         t codepre  pNow my question is since sy has capacity A and yt has capacity A, can I remove these two edges without changing the minimum cut on this graph The reason I ask is that this construction is indeed given by a single edge from x to t in the source code from Kolmogorovs library and I cannot understand this construction.p
