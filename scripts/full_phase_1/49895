I also used jquery for slide show by passing image path directly to img src, is there any way to read image path dynamically Can anybody please give me idea on how to accomplish all the three tasksslide show with exif data and play pause buttonsp  pThis is my xhtml code..p  precodeltpgalleria valueimageBean.images renderedimageBean.visible idslideshow widgetVarswitcher1 varimage panelWidth550 panelHeight370 showFilmstripfalse showCaptiontruegt      ltpgraphicImage url..imagesimage.path altimage.imageTags     titlegt ltpgalleriagt codepre
Positive 49895 pI have four layouts in my page. I want to fill the centre layout with the components from the left layout by drag and drop.But after a component is dragged from left layout to centre layout I want a copy of dragged component to be filled in left layout, i.e. the left layout should have n number of components even though when a component is dragged and dropped the same component must be inserted in the placed of dragged component.Leaving same set of components after drag and drop. Or is it possible to send primefaces components as a list from bean to xhtml.p  h2xhtmlh2  precode ltplayout fullPagefalsegt                             ltplayoutUnit positioneast size200 headerRight gt                             ltplayoutUnit positionwest size300 headerLeft                                 closabletrue collapsibletruegt                                 lthformgt                                     ltpfieldset legendAvailableCarsgt                                         ltpdataGrid idavailableCars varcar valuesdsd                                             columns3gt                                             ltpcolumngt                                                 ltppanel idpnl headerDrop Down styletextaligncentergt                                                     ltptab titleLayoutgt                                                         ltbr gt                                                         lthoutputLabel forname valueStandard Label gt                                                         ltpinputText idname disabledtrue gt                                                         ltpdraggable forname gt                                                         ltbr gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleRadio Buttongt                                                         ltpoutputLabel forconsole valueTypes gt                                                         ltpselectOneRadio idconsolegt                                                             ltfselectItem itemLabelXbox One itemValueXbox One gt                                                             ltfselectItem itemLabelPS4 itemValuePS4 gt                                                         ltpselectOneRadiogt                                                         ltpdraggable forconsole gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleDrop Downgt                                                         ltpoutputLabel forcountry valueItems  gt                                                         ltpselectOneMenu idcountry stylewidth150px                                                             valuelist gt                                                         ltpdraggable forcountry gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleImagegt                                                         ltpgraphicImage idpic valueimagesprometheus.jpg gt                                                         ltpdraggable forpic gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleSavegt                                                         ltpcommandButton idlayoutSave valueSave gt                                                         ltpdraggable forlayoutSave gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleCancelgt                                                         ltpcommandButton idlayoutCancel valueCancel gt                                                         ltpdraggable forlayoutCancel gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                 ltppanelgt                                                  ltpdraggable forpnl reverttrue                                                     handle.uipaneltitlebar stack.uipanel gt                                              ltpcolumngt                                         ltpdataGridgt                                     ltpfieldsetgt                                 lthformgt                              ltplayoutUnitgt                              ltplayoutUnit positioncenter gt                                 lthformgt                                     ltpfieldset idselectedCars stylewidth 800px height 800pxgt                                         ltpoutputPanel iddropAreagt                                             lthoutputText valueDrop here stylefontsize24px gt                                          ltpoutputPanelgt                                     ltpfieldsetgt                                     ltpdroppable forselectedCars tolerancetouch                                         activeStyleClassuistatehighlightgt                                         ltpajax listenerfundamentCreatorBean.dropped gt                                     ltpdroppablegt                                 lthformgt                             ltplayoutUnitgt                         ltplayoutgt codepre

Positive 49895 pI have 2 AutoUpdates.  The first one is meant to receive country names.  Then it does the autocomplete.  p  pAfter the item is selected a second autocomplete is set to readonlyfalse by EL inside the XHTML.p  pIt works fine until I go back to the first AutoComplete and empty the current value.  The desired behavior is to clear the second autocomplete and makes it readonlytrue, but it is not happening.  What happens is that second autocomplete remains with its value with readonlyfalse.p  pHowe to fix thisp  pMy XHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN

Positive 49895 pI am trying to change a class attribute, which is styleClass in JSF terms for JSF components. To be more clear I am clicking on an anchor which in turn is supposed to toggle an image to an image that is checked which is an image itself.  Making the class of the image element into off when the page loads is no problem that is the desired result.p  pBut what I am trying to is when I click on the link, the image element that is being contained, should switch out the images through the JSFJava managed bean code which it does but the JavaScript that I coded should take care of changing the class name from off into on when the check version of the image is shown, does not work. It seems as though when I switch out from  the regular image to a check version of the image, JSF has some builtin JavaScript executing which negatesnullifies my JavaScript code to remove the off class name and add the on class name when I click on the link.p  pI understand that the switching of the images and the changing of the class name is done through 2 different methodologies, JSFJava amp JavaScriptjQuery at the same time. I need the class name as a flag to store which elements are checked and eventually use to display certain 3D models based on whats been checked. Checking isnt done through check boxes, but shown through the changing of images inside the anchors for a particular UX effect.p  pI need the JavaJSF way of switching out the images, because the boolean values help with sending out information in an email describing whats been checked.p  pThe jQuery library version is 1.11.0.p  pHopefully I explained this situation well if not let me know how to changeclear up the post for everyones convenience.p  pJSFp  precodelthpanelGroup idtaTab classiconchoices taTab layoutblockgt     ltpcommandLink actionListenerbuildYourOwnView.toggleBestAthlete titleBest Athlete updatetaTabgt         lthgraphicImage libraryimages namebuildYourOwnView.bestAthlete  bestathlete.png  bestathletecheck.png  altBest Athletegt     ltpcommandLinkgt     ltpcommandLink actionListenerbuildYourOwnView.toggleResengine titleResEngine updatetaTabgt         lthgraphicImage libraryimages namebuildYourOwnView.resengine  resenginecheck.png resengine.png  altResEnginegt     ltpcommandLinkgt  lthpanelGroupgt codepre  pJava filep  precodepackage com.website.presentation  import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean import javax.faces.bean.ViewScoped  ManagedBean ViewScoped public class BuildYourOwnView   private boolean bestAthletefalse private boolean resenginefalse     Creates a new instance of BuildYourOwnView   public BuildYourOwnView    public void toggleBestAthlete      bestAthlete  bestAthlete   public void toggleResengine      resengine  resengine   public boolean isBestAthlete      return bestAthlete   public void setBestAthleteboolean bestAthlete      this.bestAthlete  bestAthlete   public boolean isResengine      return resengine   public void setResengineboolean resengine      this.resengine  resengine  codepre  pp  pJavaScriptp  precodeifthis.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimgnot[class]      this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.addClassoff   .iconchoices gt a.clickfunction      console.loghello     ifthis.parent.hasClasstaTab           console.logtag         this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.eachfunction              console.logone each img iteration              ifthis.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.hasClassoff                  this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.removeClassoff.addClasson                 console.logOff to on                          else if this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.hasClasson                  this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.removeClasson.addClassoff                 console.logOn to off                              codepre

Negative 49895 pIm using the MFC class CDatabase.  To establish a connection to SQL Server, Im calling OpenEx with a connection string.  My problem is that the object seems unable to interpret the DSN part of the string.  The connection string looks like thisp  precode ODBCDSNmySystemDSNUIDmyUsernameWSIDmyMachineNameDATABASEmyDatabaseNameTrustedConnectionYes codepre  pThat ought to be right because I got it by using OpenEx NULL , choosing the data source manually and then calling GetConnect.p  pBut this string doesnt seem to contain enough information OpenEx always pops up a dialogue asking for more.  It doesnt seem to matter what I choose from this dialogue  I can pick a DSN associated with a completely different database and things still work a call to GetConnect in that situation shows that its using my connection string except for the DSN part, which is borrowed from the other data source.p  pI need my application to be able to connect to the database automatically  dialogue boxes are a dealbreaker.  Ive tried a DSNless connection with similar results.

Negative 49895 pI have a file containing 800 lines likep  precodeid       binarycodedinfo  4657     001001101 4789     110111111 etc. codepre  pwhere each 0 or 1 stands for the presence of some feature. I want to read this file and do several bitwise logical operations on the binarycodedinfo the operations depend on user input and on info from a second file with 3000 lines. Then,  these recalculated binarycodedinfo should be written to file with trailing zeros, e.g. p  precode4657     000110011 4789     110110000 etc. codepre  pHow should I do this without writing my own base conversion routine I am open for anything, also languages I do not know, like python, perl, etc. And it should work without compiling.p  pSo far, I tried to script, awk and sed my way. This would mean I think batch read as base2, convert to base10, do bitwise operations depending on user input and second file, convert to base2, add leading zeros and print. The usual console hints to use bc do not seem elegant because I have many lines in a file. The same holds for dc.sed. And awk doesnt seem to have an  equivalent to flagging input as binary  as in echo 2101010  , and also, the printf trick doesnt work for binary. So, how would I do this most elegantly or, at all, for that matter p

Negative 49895 pI have this problem. I have an handler to the mainWindow of a certain application, and I want to simulate a keypress on that application...p  pIm using sendMessagepostMessage api calls to do this. The reason why I dont use the .Net SendKeys function or the keybdevent of the win32 api, is that they simulate the keypress at a global level. In my case, I may have the application minimized and still want the keypress to be simulated.p  pThe problem with sendMessage and postMessage is that you must pass the handler of the exact childwindow where you want the key to be pressed. For example, in notepad, if I send the key to the mainWindow, nothing happens, I have to send the key to the child window that basically consists of the white canvas where you can write.p  pWith msPaint for example, if a user creates a new document, and opens a textbox in that drawing, and I want to simulate a keypress there, I have to get the childwindow of the childwindow of the mainwindow for it to works.p  pSo I found a way that seemed to work for every situation, basically, I used getWindow with the parameter GWCHILD, to get the childwindow with the highest zvalue. Then I do it again for the child window and continue doing it until a certain childWindow has no more childWindows..p  pAnd it seemed to work and I was very happyp  pHowever... I found cases where this does not work. Firefox is one of them. Firefox has the mainWindow, and then has a childWindow thats pretty much the same as the mainWindow and then it has another childWindow which is the website area, ie, the area under the address bar and menus. If I am on www.google.com for example, and I want to simulate a keypress in the focused search box, it works, cause getting the childwindow of the childwindow gives me the correct childWindow. However, if the user clicks on the address bar for example, nothing changes in the way the getWindow works. It will still eventually get the childwindow thats under the address bar, doing nothing, instead of simulating the keypress on the address bar.p  pThe thing is that I havent found a way of getting the active child window of a certain application. I can only use the GetWindow method to get the child window of a certain window and do it until I find a child window with no childs. However, as youve seen in  the firefox case, the active window is actually the parent of the child window that I get in the end.p  pIve tried other api calls like getTopWindow but I had no luck..p  pAnyone can put some light on this issue Thanksp
Negative 49895 pIm writing a grep function in C as a self assigned exercise  I realize this doesnt have the functionality of an actual grep feature to take an original string and the search string you are looking for. In the code, I enter all the characters in a grep string up to the first space it sees.

I loop over the grep string and compare the length of the search string with the temp string to see if it matches.p  pMy question is that bad form, comparing lengths I could use a for loop to compare each individual character against each other, but that seems like it would eat CPU cycles unneccessarily.

Negative 49895 pFor a while, Ive been interested in creating a proofofconcept chat program using C. I have given the idea a lot of thought and even wrote down the beginnings of how I would design the system, but I have hit a barrier in my thinking when it comes to the implementation.p  pI want to know what an implementation of a peertopeer chat client with a server to route connections would look like in C.p  pThe server would be used as a central registry of the peers, but not used as the primary connection. The server would not interact with the clients in any way except to assign connections between peers to achieve an optimal path between peers. In a first version, it would merely be a directory to which all clients connect, and the clients can then use the directory to connect to the other clients available for chat. I hope that explains it a bit more.  p

Negative 49895 pIm currently looking at ways to pass lists of integers in a SQL query, and try to decide which of them is best in which situation, what are the benefots of each, and what are the pitfalls, what should be avoided p  pRight now I know of 3 ways that we currently use in our application.p  pstrong1 Table valued parameterstrong Create a new Table Valued Parameter in sql serverp  precodeCREATE TYPE [dbo].[TVPINT] AS TABLE     [ID] [int] NOT NULL  codepre  pThen run the query against itp  precodeusing var conn  new SqlConnectionDataContext.GetDefaultConnectionString      var comm  conn.CreateCommand     comm.CommandType  CommandType.Text     comm.CommandText   UPDATE DA     SET [tsLastImportAttempt]  CURRENTTIMESTAMP FROM [Account] DA JOIN values IDs ON DA.ID  IDs.ID     comm.Parameters.Addnew SqlParametervalues, downloadResults.Selectd gt d.ID.ToDataTable  TypeName  TVPINT      conn.Open     comm.ExecuteScalar  codepre  pThe major disadvantages of this method is the fact that Linq doesnt support table valued params if you create an SP with a TVP param, linq wont be able to run it p  pstrong2 Convert the list to Binary and use it in Linqstrong This is a bit better.. Create an SP, and you can run it within linq p  pTo do this, the SP will have an IMAGE parameter, and well be using a user defined function udf to convert this to a table.. We currently have implementations of this function written in C and in assembly, both have pretty much the same performance  Basically, each integer is represented by 4 bytes, and passed to the SP. In .NET we have an extension method that convers an IEnumerable to a byte arrayp  pThe extension method     public static Byte[] ToBinarythis IEnumerable intList              return ToBinaryEnumintList.ToArray     p  precodeprivate static IEnumerableltBytegt ToBinaryEnumIEnumerableltInt32gt intList      IEnumeratorltInt32gt marker  intList.GetEnumerator     while marker.MoveNext              Byte[] result  BitConverter.GetBytesmarker.Current         Array.Reverseresult         foreach byte b in result             yield return b       codepre  pThe SPp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE [AccountsUpdateImportAttempts]     values IMAGE AS BEGIN  UPDATE DA     SET [tsLastImportAttempt]  CURRENTTIMESTAMP FROM [Account] DA JOIN dbo.udfIntegerArrayvalues, 4 IDs ON DA.ID  IDs.Value4  END codepre  pAnd we can use it by running the SP directly, or in any linq query we needp  precodeusing var db  new DataContext      db.AccountsUpdateImportAttemptsdownloadResults.Selectd gt d.ID.ToBinary      or     var accounts  db.Accounts         .Wherea gt db.udfIntegerArraydownloadResults.Selectd gt d.ID.ToBinary, 4             .Selecti gt i.Value4             .Containsa.ID  codepre  pThis method has the benefit of using compiled queries in linq which will have the same sql definition, and query plan, so will also be cached, and can be used in SPs as well.p  pBoth these methods are theoretically unlimited, so you can pass millions of ints at a time p  pstrong3 The simple linq .Containsstrong Its a more simple approach, and is perfect in simple scenarios. But is of course limited by this.p  precodeusing var db  new DataContext      var accounts  db.Accounts         .Wherea gt downloadResults.Selectd gt d.ID.Containsa.ID  codepre  pThe biggest drawback of this method is that each integer in the downloadResults variable will be passed as a separate int.. In this case, the query is limited by sql max allowed parameters in a sql query, which is a couple of thousand, if I remember right.p  hr   pSo Id like to ask.. What do you think is the best of these, and what other methods and approaches have I missedp

Negative 49895 pI normally use the method described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1120140csvparserinc11202241120224csv parsera to read spreadsheet files. However, when reading a 64MB file which has around 40 columns and 250K rows of data, it takes about 4 minutes.

He believes there is some sort of problem with the way I have written my loop, but Ive sat here for hours and I really do not see it.p  precodefunction appendTasksdivs,clients Make the AJAX Request for Categories  var s0 whilesltdivs.length      var dividdivs[s]  var clientidclients[s]  var parametersnew Array  parameters[action]categories     var response  AJAXRequestExecutecheck.php, true, false, parameters  Make the AJAX request for tasks  div  divid.appendresponse.variable1  Get tasks for each individual category  for var i  1 i lt 12 i     parameters[no]i   parameters[client]clientid   parameters[action]tasks   response  AJAXRequestExecutecheck.php, true, false, parameters         Append if theres something there, otherwise, hide   ifresponse.variable1       divdivid .tasks[idi].appendltulgtresponse.variable1ltulgt    alertdivdivid .tasks[idi]      else       divdivid gt h2.eachfunction    ifthis.attrnamei    this.hide       Do the last one too  ifresponse.variable1     divdivid gt   i.appendltul gtresponse.variable1ltulgt       else     divdivid gt h2.eachfunction   ifthis.attrnamei   this.hide   ADD ONE MORE ss1      Reverse Version function appendTasksdivs,clients Make the AJAX Request for Categories  var sdivs.length1 whilesgt1      var dividdivs[s]  var clientidclients[s]  var parametersnew Array  parameters[action]categories     var response  AJAXRequestExecutecheck.php, true, false, parameters  Make the AJAX request for tasks  div  divid.appendresponse.variable1  Get tasks for each individual category  for var i  1 i lt 12 i     parameters[no]i   parameters[client]clientid   parameters[action]tasks   response  AJAXRequestExecutecheck.php, true, false, parameters         Append if theres something there, otherwise, hide   ifresponse.variable1       divdivid .tasks[idi].appendltulgtresponse.variable1ltulgt    alertdivdivid .tasks[idi]      else       divdivid gt h2.eachfunction    ifthis.attrnamei    this.hide       Do the last one too  ifresponse.variable1     divdivid gt   i.appendltul gtresponse.variable1ltulgt       else     divdivid gt h2.eachfunction   ifthis.attrnamei   this.hide   sub ONE MORE ss1     codepre

Negative 49895 pNoobish question Im looking for a stronglightweight but decent php way to search all fields of a MySql table, regardless the structurestrong. I first gave it a try on my own with the default mysql select but thats too basic. Im looking for something that should at least order results by best match keyword highlighting would be nice too.p  pIm surprised by the little info I found googling around.  What I found so far is the a hrefhttpframework.zend.commanualenzend.search.lucene.htmlZend Framework Lucene implementationa but that seems a bit too heavy building a separate index for my needs. Before digging into it I was wondering if theres no easier way.p
Negative 49895 pI have an ObservableCollection, which holds a codePersoncode object. I have a search feature in my application, and would like to display the most relevant results at the top. What would be the most efficient way of doing this My current search method simply calls the codecontainscode methodp  precode var results  from s in userList                where s.Name.Containsquery                select s.ToList codepre  pThis works fine, but the results are ordered in the same order they appear within codeuserListcode. If I search for codePetecode, then it should first display codePetecode, then codePetercode then codePeter Smithcode etc.. It doesnt have to be too complicated as it will only be dealing with a couple thousand max results. My naive approach was to first do codes.Name  querycode, display that item if any, then perform the codes.Name.Containsquerycode, remove the matched item and append it to the previous matched result. However, this seems a bit all over the place and so is there a better way thanks ps  only the name will be used in searching, and I cant use SQL methodsp

Negative 49895 pIm  a newbie to threading, and I dont really know how to code a particular task.  I would like to handle a mouse click event on a window that will kick off a while loop in a seperate thread.  This thread, which is distinct from the UI thread, should call a function in the while loop which updates a label on the window being serviced by the UI thread.  The while loop should stop running when the left mouse button is no longer being pressed.  All the loop does is increment a counter, and then repeatedly call the function which displays the updated value in the window.  The code for the window and all of the threading is given below I keep getting some error about STA threading, but dont know where to put the attribute.  Also, Im hoping to use this solution, if it ever works, in another project that makes asynchronous calls elsewhere  to a service via wcf, so I was hoping not to make any applicationwide special configurations, since Im really new to multithreading and am quite worried about breaking other code in a larger program...

Negative 49895 pI am trying to use AutoMapper to map some DTO data contract objects received from a web service into my business objects.  The root DTO object contains a collection of child objects.  My business object also has a child collection of child business objects.  In order to get AutoMapper to work, I had to include a setter on the collection property in my business object or the collection would always be empty.  In addition, I had to add a default constructor to the collection type.  So, it appears to me that AutoMapper is instantiating a new collection object, populating it and setting as the collection property of my business object.p  pWhile this is all well and good, I have additional logic that has to be wired up when the collection is created and having the default constructor defeats the purpose.  Essentially, I am establishing the parentchild relationship and wiring up some events so they bubble from child to parent.p  pWhat I would like to do is to have AutoMapper simply map the child objects from the DTOs collection to the existing collection on my BO.  In other words, skip creating a new collection and simply use the one the business object already has.p  pIs there any way to easily accomplish thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pPerhaps a better question, and simpler solution to my problem, is if it is possible to define arguments that AutoMapper will pass to the collection when instantiated  My child collection is defined like thisp    pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class ChildCollection  CollectionltChildObjectsgt      public ChildCollectionParentObject parent  Parent  parent   codepre  pIf I can configure AutoMapper to use this constructor and pass in the proper object, that would be PERFECTp  pstrongANOTHER UPDATEstrongp  pFor the sake of clarity, here are the other classes in the problem spacep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class ParentObject      private ChildCollection children      public ChildCollection Children              get                      if children  null children  new ChildCollectionthis              return children                 public class ParentDTO      public ICollectionltChildDTOgt Children  get set    public class ChildDTO      public String SomeProperty  get set   codepre  pI configure AutoMapper this wayp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeMapper.CreateMapltParentDTO, ParentObjectgt Mapper.CreateMapltChildDTO, ChildObjectgt codepre  pDoing so this way and I have to add a setter to the Children property in ParentObject and a default parameterless constructor to ChildCollection.  While I can work around the need to define the parentchild relationship, it seems that it would be logical to expect AutoMapper to support configuring the map to use a specific constructor when creating the child collection.  Something like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeMapper.CreateMapltParentDTO, ParentObjectgt     .ForMemberobj gt obj.Children,                opt.MapFromdto gt dto.Children                   .ConstructUsingcol gt new ChildCollectionobj codepre  pNotice that I am passing in the reference to obj which is the ParentObject instance being mapped.p

So doesnt cas allow only one operation to happen on the same object , and stops  strongblockstrong  others those want to operate on the same object  Sorry for so many doubts... please clarify...p  pstrongEDITstrong what happens when i have a structure to update  does it also  supported by hardware  No right, So doesnt language would be acquiring locks at some level to make these structure operation atomic br About strongJAVAstrong  there are AtomicReference and AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater class which provides updation to a object  structure or any kind of object , so can we compare them in terms of performance i mean speed  Both in tern uses Unsafe class which uses Native class . p

Negative 49895 pI am working on a C server.NET client applications couple in which my server which runs the c on linux broadcasts a message to show its alive to the whole network and my .NET program listens for packets and parses to get the uptime of the server.p  pAs I have read, to send a regular UDP broadcast to the broadcast address, I simply have to send a packet to 192.168.0.255 in my case 192.168.2.255 or 255.255.255.255. Is this right Can I use the same port address Are there any other necessities p  pI understand the fact that if my .NET program listens on that particular address it is possible to receive packets from other applications than my C server program. Is there any method of signing the packet on the C serverside in order for my .NET program to read the header of the packet and see that it is almost the one I am looking for  p

Negative 49895 pI am using A for pathfinding in a Java project that I am working on. My attempt at implementing it though, has some issues. Not only is it slightly slow, but it sometimes runs into infinite loop issues where it never finds a path. I believe this to be the result of a bug somewhere in my code. The pathfinder operates on 3d space, and uses a basic heuristic I can provide the code if necessary, however, it does little more than just calculate the distance squared between the two points.p  pThe code is herep  precodepublic class BinaryPathFinder extends PathFinder    private final PriorityBufferltPathNodegt paths   private final HashMapltPoint, Integergt mindists  new HashMapltPoint, Integergt   private final ComparableComparatorltPathNodegt comparator  new ComparableComparatorltPathNodegt   private Path lastPath   private Point start, end   private final byte SIZEINCREMENT  20    public BinaryPathFinderPathHeuristic heuristic,       Pathplayer player, PathWorld pathWorld      superheuristic, player, pathWorld     this.world  pathWorld.getWorld     paths  new PriorityBufferltPathNodegt8000, comparator       Override   public boolean find      try        PathNode root  new PathNode       root.point  start       calculateTotalCostroot, start, start, false       expandroot       while true          PathNode p  paths.remove         if p  null           return false         Point last  p.point         if isGoallast            calculatePathp  Iterate back.           this.mindists.clear           this.paths.clear           return true                  expandp             catch Exception e        e.printStackTrace          this.mindists.clear     this.paths.clear     return false       Override   public Path path      return this.lastPath       Override   public void recalculatePoint start, Point end      this.start  start     this.end  end     this.lastPath  null       private void expandPathNode path      Point p  path.point     Integer min  mindists.getp     if min  null  min gt path.totalCost       mindists.putp, path.totalCost     else       return     Point[] successors  generateSuccessorsp     for Point t  successors        if t  null         continue       PathNode newPath  new PathNodepath       newPath.point  t       calculateTotalCostnewPath, p, t, false       paths.addnewPath            private void calculatePathPathNode p      Point[] retPath  new Point[20]     Point[] copy  null     short added  0     for PathNode i  p i  null i  i.parent        if added gt retPath.length          copy  new Point[retPath.length  SIZEINCREMENT]         System.arraycopyretPath, 0, copy, 0, retPath.length         retPath  copy              retPath[added]  i.point          this.lastPath  new PathretPath       private int calculateHeuristicPoint start, Point end, boolean endPoint      return this.heuristic.calculatestart, end, this.pathWorld,         this.player, endPoint       private int calculateTotalCostPathNode p, Point from, Point to,       boolean endPoint      int g  calculateHeuristicfrom, to, endPoint  p.parent  null  p.parent.cost          0     int h  calculateHeuristicfrom, to, endPoint     p.cost  g     p.totalCost  g  h     return p.totalCost       private Point[] generateSuccessorsPoint point      Point[] points  new Point[27]     Point temp  null     byte counter  1     for int x  point.x  1 x lt point.x  1 x        for int y  point.y  1 y gt point.y  1 y          for int z  point.z  1 z lt point.z  1 z            counter           if x  0 ampamp y  0 ampamp z  0             continue           temp  new Pointx, y, z           if validtemp             points[counter]  temp                          return points       private boolean isGoalPoint last      return last.equalsthis.end     codepre  pPathNode is herep  precodepublic class PathNode implements ComparableltPathNodegt    public Point point   public final PathNode parent   public int cost   public int totalCost    public PathNodePoint point, PathNode parent, short cost, short totalCost      this.point  point     this.parent  parent     this.cost  cost     this.totalCost  totalCost       public PathNode      this.point  null     this.parent  null     this.cost  this.totalCost  0       public PathNodePathNode path      this.parent  path     this.cost  path.cost     this.totalCost  path.totalCost       Override   public int compareToPathNode node      int result  node.totalCost  node.cost     if result gt node.totalCost       return 1     else if result  0       return 0     else       return 1     codepre  pPoint is just a wrapper class that defines integer x, y, z values.p  pI am using the Apache Commons PriorityBuffer for storing path nodes.

Negative 49895 pI have a program in Linux which is multithreaded. There are certain memory areas in which Im interested to see if they have been written within a certain time period. For that I give only read access to those memory pages and install a signal handler for SIGSEGV. Now my question is, will each thread call the signal handler for itself. Say Thread 1 writes to some forbidden memory area, will it be the one to execute the signal handlerp
Negative 49895 pHeres the situation Ive got a MongoDB cluster and a webapp, which does a pretty intensive MapReduce query. This query happens periodically every 5min in a cron job, and the results are stored using codemergecode into a collection.p  pstrongWhat worksstrong Currently, the query performs over every record in its collection. Said collection is slowly growing to be millions of rows, and each time it runs, it takes a little longer.p  pstrongThe obvious solutionstrong is to run the MapReduce over new records, and use the reduce function over the old stored values to calculate the correct value. MongoDB is great, it lets you specify a codereducecode option instead of codemergecode to do just that.p  pstrongWhat I cant figure outstrong How to correctly perform the MR only over new records in the initial collection. I see two potential solutions, neither of which are good. Ideasp  ol liI could flag records that have been processed. Problem is how to flag exactly the same records that I just MRd overli liI could query for the matching items, then pass the list of ids as an codein [id1, id2, ...]code query to the MapReduce, and then send an update to set my flag using the same codeincode. But thats really inelegant, and I dont know how thats going to perform when the list of records is huge. li ol  pemtldrem How do I only select new records in a MapReduce query that reduces its result into a collection.p

Negative 49895 pI often read that stronglazystrong is not the same as strongnonstrictstrong but I find it hard to understand the difference. They emseemem to be used interchangeably but I understand that they have different meanings. I would appreciate some help understanding the difference.p  pI have a few questions which are scattered about this post. I will summarize those questions at the end of this post. I have a few example snippets, I did not test them, I only presented them as concepts. I have added quotes to save you from looking them up. Maybe it will help someone later on with the same question.p  h2NonStrict Defh2  blockquote   pA function f is said to be strict if, when applied to a nonterminating   expression, it also fails to terminate. In other words, f is strict   iff the value of f bot is emem. For most programming languages, all   functions are strict. But this is not so in Haskell. As a simple   example, consider const1, the constant 1 function, defined by p      pconst1 x                 1p      pThe value of const1 bot in Haskell is 1. Operationally speaking, since   const1 does not need the value of its argument, it never attempts to   evaluate it, and thus never gets caught in a nonterminating   computation. For this reason, nonstrict functions are also called   lazy functions, and are said to evaluate their arguments lazily,   or by need.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpwww.haskell.orgtutorialfunctions.htmlA Gentle Introduction To Haskell Functionsap  pI really like this definition. It seems the best one I could find for understanding strict. Is codeconst1 x  1code lazy as wellp  blockquote   pNonstrictness means that reduction the mathematical term for   evaluation proceeds from the outside in,p      pso if you have abc then first you reduce the , then you reduce   the inner bc.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiLazyvs.nonstrictHaskell Wiki Lavy vs nonstrictap  pThe Haskell Wiki really confuses me. I understand what they are saying about order but I fail to see how codeabccode would evaluate nonstrictly if it was pass codecodep  blockquote   pIn nonstrict evaluation, arguments to a function are not evaluated   unless they are actually used in the evaluation of the function body.p      pUnder Church encoding, lazy evaluation of operators maps to nonstrict   evaluation of functions for this reason, nonstrict evaluation is   often referred to as lazy. Boolean expressions in many languages use   a form of nonstrict evaluation called shortcircuit evaluation, where   evaluation returns as soon as it can be determined that an unambiguous   Boolean will result  for example, in a disjunctive expression where   true is encountered, or in a conjunctive expression where false is   encountered, and so forth. Conditional expressions also usually use   lazy evaluation, where evaluation returns as soon as an unambiguous   branch will result.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEvaluationstrategyNonstrictevaluationWikipedia Evaluation Strategyap  h2Lazy Defh2  blockquote   pLazy evaluation, on the other hand, means only evaluating an   expression when its results are needed note the shift from   reduction to evaluation. So when the evaluation engine sees an   expression it builds a thunk data structure containing whatever values   are needed to evaluate the expression, plus a pointer to the   expression itself. When the result is actually needed the evaluation   engine calls the expression and then replaces the thunk with the   result for future reference.   ...p      pObviously there is a strong correspondence between a thunk and a   partlyevaluated expression. Hence in most cases the terms lazy and   nonstrict are synonyms. But not quite.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiLazyvs.nonstrictHaskell Wiki Lavy vs nonstrictap  pThis seems like a Haskell specific answer. I take that stronglazystrong means thunks and strongnonstrictstrong means partial evaluation. Is that comparison too simplified Does stronglazystrong always mean thunks and strongnonstrictstrong always mean partial evaluation.p  blockquote   pIn programming language theory, lazy evaluation or callbyneeda hrefhttpwww.haskell.orgtutorialfunctions.html1a is   an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression   until its value is actually required nonstrict evaluation and also   avoid repeated evaluations sharing.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLazyevaluationWikipedia Lazy Evaluationap  h2Imperative Examplesh2  pI know most people say forget imperative programming when learning a functional language. However, I would like to know if these qualify as nonstrict, lazy, both or neither At the very least it would provide something familiar.p  pstrongShort Circuitingstrongp  precodef1  f2 codepre  pstrongC, Python and other languages with yieldstrongp  precodepublic static IEnumerable Powerint number, int exponent      int counter  0     int result  1     while counter lt exponent              result  result  number         yield return result       codepre  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary9k7k7cf028vvs.8029.aspxMSDN yield cap  pstrongCallbacksstrongp  precodeint f1  return 1 int f2  return 2  int lazyint cb1, int cb2 , int x      if x  0         return cb1     else         return cb2   int eagerint e1, int e2, int x      if x  0          return e1     else          return e2   lazyf1, f2, x eagerf1, f2, x codepre  h2Questionsh2  pI know the answer is right in front of me with all those resources, but I cant grasp it.

Negative 49895 pIm trying to make an app for android using facebooks SSO, so first i made a test app to test their api.p  pIve been following the Android starting tutorial a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsmobileandroidbuild relnofollowhere on the facebook dev sitea. All was working well. When the app got started it would let me sign into facebook using its traditional webview login since facebook wasnt installed on the emulator. Then i noticed that if you have facebook already installed then it would use a more fancy screen to log in.p  pSo i installed facebook, opened the app, all went well. Closed and reopened the app and the facebook reauthorize screen popped up but this time with no info on it.. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8Ujot.png altenter image description herep  pWhich is abit odd... so when i click on Ok this shows up..p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPFV4e.png altenter image description herep  pso if i click ok again it just opens facebook in a browser.

Negative 49895 pIve got 2 C applications that communicate via WCF, one has a codeServiceHostcode singleton object with a codeNetNamedPipeBindingcode end point, the client creates an instance of the exposed interface via a codeDuplexChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode call. Sometimes my client will start before my server and so the client needs to know whether the server is available. The codeCreateChannelcode call succeeds regardless but subsequent calls to the interface functions fail with an exception. Once a call has failed, any calls after that fail with an error that the channel is faulted. Is my only option to catch these exceptions and create a new channel each time or is there a better wayp  pThanks, Jp

Negative 49895 pHaving a bit of an issue here. Im creating an application in Visual Studio 2010 in C Windows Forms.p  pThe UI is going to be done in a WebBrowser so I can use jQuery goodness and for ease of development.p  pFor this I want to create a folder called codeHTMLcode which will store all my HTML files and my javascript files.p  pMy colleague tells me to create the folder separately and copy and paste into the compiled application directory referencing the files using codeSystem.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory.ToString  HTMLFirstPage.htmcode etc...p  pThis seems strange to me. His argument is sound  if you need to editchange anything then you dont need to open your VM were on Macs open Visual Studio, edit, recompile, redistribute etc you just open the HTML files in the application directory. my argument to this was that its just not that much extra workp  pI can see problems coming when different versions of the HTML files start getting mixed up and such, and to me it feels more right to compile the files directly as resources  OR... at least have them as files within the project explorer in Visual Studio. p  pSo my question is What would be the best way to do this Would it be best to compile the HTML files as resources and how would I do that Im very new to all this Or would it be better to do it the way my colleague said If so is there a way to get Visual Studio to automatically copy the latest version of the files into the application directory at build timep  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 49895 pI have a custom layout where the principal behaviour is to grow and shrink a child JTextArea when the JScrollPane its in changes in width.  The scroll pane has the horizontal scroll bar disabled and the text area is supposed to expand and contract so as to avoid needing a horz scroll bar.vFor a number of months, I worked around this using one of the standard layout managers, but now I need some different functionality.p  pWhats happening is that when the user expands horizontally the scroll pane, the layout manager layoutContainer method is called.  It resizes the text area and the text reflows properly.  However, when you shrink the scroll pane, layoutContainer is not called and the text area stays fixed.  Ive put some printlns in the layoutContainer method to make it obvious when its working and not.p  pThe essential thing to note is that the problem happens JTextArea setColumns is called.  I can comment it out and the layoutContainer gets called during resizing.  Of course, then the text area doesnt get resized.  Ive tried also using JTextArea.setSize, with the same results.p  pThanks in advance for any ideas.p  pHeres the codep  precode  SuppressWarningsserial class XTextArea extends JTextArea      XTextArea String text              super text           public int getColumnWidth              return super.getColumnWidth          class PackLeftLayout implements LayoutManager      Component viewPort     Component flexWidthComponent      int preferredWidth  0     int preferredHeight  0            viewPort  if null, compute width as sum of components preferred width       otherwise width will be the viewPorts width.      flexWidthComponent  if not null, this component width will be sized to right        justify rightmost component.     public PackLeftLayout Component viewPort, Component flexWidthComponent              super          this.viewPort  viewPort         this.flexWidthComponent  flexWidthComponent                public void addLayoutComponentString name, Component comp                     public void removeLayoutComponentComponent comp                      Calculates the preferred size dimensions for the specified container, given the      components it contains.      parent  the container to be laid out      Components layed out lefttoright with no additional spacing.     public Dimension preferredLayoutSize Container parent              Insets insets  parent.getInsets         int width  0         int height  0  will become max of all components preferred height           calculate sum of fixed width components  skip the flexwidth component         width  insets.left  insets.right         for int i  0, limit  parent.getComponentCount  i lt limit  i                      Component c  parent.getComponenti             if c.isVisible                              if c  flexWidthComponent                                      Dimension size  c.getPreferredSize                     if size.height gt height                     height  size.height                     width  size.width                                                  determine width of flex width component         if flexWidthComponent  null                      int flexWidth  viewPort.getWidth  width             if flexWidth lt 1                 flexWidth  1              if flexWidthComponent instanceof XTextArea                               some trickery here to get the xtextarea to tell us its preferred height                  given a specific width.                 int colWidth  XTextAreaflexWidthComponent.getColumnWidth                   the following line causes the failure                 XTextAreaflexWidthComponent.setColumns flexWidth  colWidth                  Dimension taSize  flexWidthComponent.getPreferredSize                 width  taSize.width                  if taSize.height gt height                     height  taSize.height                          else                              Dimension size  flexWidthComponent.getPreferredSize                 width  flexWidth                 if size.height gt height                     height  size.height                                preferredWidth  width  already include insets         preferredHeight  height  insets.top  insets.bottom          return new Dimension preferredWidth, preferredHeight                 Calculates the minimum size dimensions for the specified container, given the      components it contains.      parent  the component to be laid out     public Dimension minimumLayoutSizeContainer parent            return new Dimension 10, 10            static int k  0          public void layoutContainerContainer parent              System.out.println layout  k         Insets insets  parent.getInsets         int left  insets.left          if preferredWidth  0  preferredHeight  0             preferredLayoutSize parent          for int i  0, limit  parent.getComponentCount  i lt limit  i                      Component c  parent.getComponenti             Dimension size  c.getPreferredSize              c.setBounds left, insets.top, size.width, preferredHeight              left  size.width                    force another layout calc         preferredWidth  0        public class ResizablePane extends JFrame       public static void mainString[] args              javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater             new Runnable public void run                              new ResizablePane                        ResizablePane               super ResizableDemo           put a button and text area into a panel, then into a scroll pane         JButton button  new JButton button         XTextArea text  new XTextArea              For three years I ran as fast as I could, trying to live and love and learn at               double speed to make up for what AnneMarie lost.

Negative 49895 pIm trying to learn Java so sorry if this is a stupid question, but I seem to be unable to change the default close operation on my JFrame in NetBeans.p  pIn NetBeans I created a JFrame and implemented some controls on it using the NetBeans GUI designer.  However, I noticed that after I close the JFrame, my application would close even though I have another form that is supposed to appear afterwards.p  pAfter digging through the JFrame generated code I foundp  precodesetDefaultCloseOperationjavax.swing.WindowConstants.EXITONCLOSE codepre  pFrom research it appears that this causes the application to close when the frame is closed. I would prefer to not have this happen.  From looking around, it appears I either need to use codeDISPOSEONCLOSEcode or codeDONOTHINGONCLOSEcode in order to get the window to close but still have additional code to run.p  pHowever, I cant figure out how to get NetBeans to change this value through the designer.  I found the codedefaultCloseOperationcode in the Properties  Bindings window, but every time I enter something into the text area and press enter my text disappears.  The binding has an elipsis but I cant figure out what the binding window actually does.p  pHow can I change my codesetDefaultCloseOperationcode to a new valuep

Negative 49895 pI have a specific goal in mind I want to make a todolisttype app for my group at work to use. My key requirements are to have very easy entry and removal of items, as well as work in an OS X environment. The first requirement is because anything that is easy to use is more likely to be used, and the second is because thats what were on. The application will need to be liveupdating among multiple users, but authentication is not a requirement. Distribution of the same app to other remote teams is a plus, but not required. Just a shared todo list, with taskspecific things to be added. It doesnt have to be a web app native is great but the world at large seems to be more and more webrelated these days. p  pIve been looking at a number of technologies such as Ruby and Rails, PHP, MAMP, Cappuccino, FileMaker, Trac, and a few other options  but the paradox of choice means that I dont really know what is best to use. Looking at that list it is obvious that I dont really know what I should be looking at, let alone how to decide on things. Im drowning in a sea of opportunities and a surplus if good enough.p  pI am a somewhatexperienced with ObjectiveC and Cocoa, but excluding Cappuccino, those skills dont directly relate. Im rather excited to learn new things, so my existing skill set is not especially important.p  pWhat sounds natural for this  Im fully prepared for the fact there is no right option. Who here has a favorite methodology Whats a good application stack that has proven itself in rapid development time and future flexibilityp  pTLDR I want to make a concurrentlyupdated todo app for a small work team. It specifically emdoes notem need to be featurefilled, but should be simple to build and maintain. What is the right tool for the jobp  pEDIT My team does nothing related to software dev, but my own personal mindset is that of a software dev. Part of the reason I am not afraid to roll up my sleeves and learn something new is a matter of personal development.p

The way I exported it was to export each DataTable in the DataSet to a different worksheet, so the data could be easily edited and then uploaded back into a DataSet easily, but now I need to get it back into the proper nested XML.p  pHelp Thanks in advance.p

Negative 49895 pFor my application, I have the requirement to develop the same functionality in a ASP.NET Web Forms application and a WPF disconnected application. I need to choose a presentation pattern that will accommodate both technologies smoothly. I was leaning toward MVP, using the MVC framework but it seems that all of the MVP frameworks are not really supported any more or need to be extended to support WPF. On the other side of the coin, MVVM seems to be the hot presentation pattern at the moment but wikipedia mentions that there are drawbacks to MVVM when it comes to larger applications.p  pI need some guidance on choosing a pattern and an implementation framework that will not be deprecated in just a few short years. Is MVP dead for the .NET stack Is MVVM the better choice Is there an MVVM framework for ASP.NET Web Formsp  pAny suggestions would be greately appreciatedp

Negative 49895 pRecently Ive noticed that variance annotations can be used in type aliases. Here is example from codePredefcodep  precodetype Function[A, B]  Function1[A, B] codepre  pAnd I started to think, where it could be used. Obviously, you cant change variance to opposite, or make an invariant type to behave as co or contravariant. Compiler will throw an error, like thisp  precodescalagt type BrokenFunc[T, R]  Function1[T, R] ltconsolegt7 error covariant type T occurs in contravariant position in type    [T, R]T gt R of type BrokenFunc codepre  pBut, you can make some variant type to behave like invariant at least, compiler wouldnt argue with that. So, I tried to make an invariant version of codeListcodep  precodescalagt type InvList[T]  List[T] defined type alias InvList codepre  pBut this new invariant codeListcode still behaves just like its original covariant versionp  precodescalagt val l InvList[String]  Listfoo l InvList[String]  Listfoo  scalagt val anyList InvList[Any]  l anyList InvList[Any]  Listfoo codepre  pSo, what I am missing Whats the purpose of variance annotations in type aliases Can you give an example of type alias with variance annotations, that will differ from original type.p

Negative 49895 pI have a function codeOnCreatecode that runs once every second. codeOnCreatecode calls other functions based on the current time current second. But instead of having to write each function individually inside of codeOnCreatecode, I would like to be able to group together functions i.e. in codeOnCreatecode at the 10 second mark I want to call a function codeCreateFiveXcodes which creates a new X starting now, and continues to do so at each new second for 5 seconds. Then at the 20 second mark I want codeOnCreatecode to call the same function again. p  pI would like to solve this problem using Events and Delegates. Im thinking that at the start of codeOnCreatecode I want to fire an event that takes the current time and sends it to all subscribers and if one matches i.e. the time they should fire matches the current time they fire and are removed from the subscribing list. p  pThe problem is that after too much time I still cannot figure out how to do this, and to make it even harder I would like to pass extra parameters to the functions that codeOnCreatecode calls. Any and all help would be nice, thanks. p

Negative 49895 pThis is not my code. I just arrived at this site and am doing code review.p  pThey have a class which is an extension of Dialog. It has been defined as a singleton.p  pOn the first call the context is passed to the getInstance method. It instantiates the class passing the received context to the super within the constructor. Then it saves it  same as in any singleton.p  pIt then displays the dialog. After user interaction it starts a new activity and closes the dialog via closeDialog. p  pHowever, it is still alive since the static holder for the instance is still there. Will this then hold on to the activity that created it and was passed on the getInstance call and into the super when creating the instancep  pThey keep the instance alive because they then use it for calls from other places and have values that need to be carried over.p  pI know this code stinks but I want to be sure that it does leak memory the first activity before I make them rewrite it or rewrite it myself  which is more likely.p

Negative 49895 pI have an issue related with the timezone that Im not able to solve. Maybe someone here can give me a hand. I will try to explain the scenariop  pI have 2 serversp  ul liWindows Server 2008 this is the application server in which I have a web service running over an Apache Tomcat 6.29.

By other hand the web service that is running in the windows server is developed with Java and Apache CXF JAXWS  JAXB.

Examples of WS responsesp  precode    XmlSchemaTypename  date     protected Date birthDate     XmlSchemaTypename  dateTime     protected Date activationDate codepre  pThe problem I have is that some of these dates are returned by the WS with timezone 0200 and some others with timezone 0300, and Im not able to find an explanation.p  pAs far as I know the timezone is set by java taking the proper value from the OS, Im not sure but I think Oracle does not store the timezone of a date, correct me If Im wrong. So, from my understanding all the dates should come with the same timezone.p  pAny idea  Thanks in advancep

Negative 49895 pI am currently playing around with OCR on android. Therefore I wrote a small app with a Camera preview and now I am feeding tessearact tools tesstwo images from my onPreviewFrame method. Now I want to display the bounding rectacles from the OCR on my Camera Preview. The TessBaseAPI provides methods that return characterword bouding boxes. The type of the returned object is Pixa, as in the leptonica library provided with tesstwo.p  pSo my Question is strongHow do i get usable coordinates which I can use to draw the bounding boxes on my camera preview from the Pixa objects returned by getCharacters or getWords from the TessBaseAPIstrongp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comrmtheistesstwoblobmastertesstwosrccomgooglecodetesseractandroidTessBaseAPI.javaL438GetCharacters and getWords in the BaseAPIap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comrmtheistesstwoblobmastertesstwosrccomgooglecodeleptonicaandroidPixa.javaleptonicas Pixa classap  pemImportantem p  pBecause the previews only supported imageformat is YUV N21 and as far from what I have read the tessAPI requires ARGB8888 Bitmaps I have the following workaround in my onPreviewFrame method right before i feed the bitmap to the TessAPI I am also rotating by 90 degrees clockwise because I am using the camera in portrait orientation, but the cameras preview frames come in landscapep  precodebyte[] bmpdata lt the image in a byte array NV21 Imageformat in onPreviewFrame  YuvImage yuvimage  new YuvImagebmpdata,ImageFormat.NV21,width,height,null   ByteArrayOutputStream outStream  new ByteArrayOutputStream Rect rect  new Rect0, 0, width, height yuvimage.compressToJpegrect, 100, outStream  Bitmap bmp  BitmapFactory.decodeByteArrayoutStream.toByteArray,0,outStream.size  Matrix mtx  new Matrix mtx.preRotate90 bmp  Bitmap.createBitmapbmp, 0, 0, bmp.getWidth, bmp.getHeight, mtx, false bmp  bmp.copyBitmap.Config.ARGB8888, true  TessTBaseApi.setImagebmp codepre  pSo basically, I compress the  NV21 byte[] I got from the camera into a YuvImage, then into a jpeg, and from there into a bitmap. I searched the web alot for the solution on how to get bitmapjpeg from the NV21 array and this was the easiest i found. This bitmap will be fed to tesseract tools OCR. This brings me to my second questionp  pstrongHow, after these compressions and 90 degree rotation, do I locate where I have to draw the boxes on screenstrong relative to before the compressions and the rotation p  pThis might not be the best or even a good way to supply the OCR with live frames, I appreciate very much comments, other solutions or suggestions of ways of optimzation.p  pI started this Project two days ago and am a very beginner in programming for android and ocr. During these two days this page helped me alot and answered questions I had so far very well, so thanks for that and thank you in advance for helping me with my current problem.

Negative 49895 pI have been working on a website for a while now a hrefhttpstrobepage.com relnofollowhttpstrobepage.coma ATTENTION do not click if you are suffering of epillepsy.. Basically the idea is that the viewer can chose between different strobe illusions and colours.. p  pI got thinking, and I thought, I can make things a hell of a lot easier by allowing users to select the 2 colours in a strobe animation instead of me making a number of different specific animations that have various different colours..  Possibly, there could be different SWFs that the user can pick from on the home page and  these different SWFs could all have a different number of colour rotations in the strobe, for example 3 repeating colours..  I realise that this would only be relevant if its not possible to integrate everything into a single file..p  pAnyway, I have tried and tried many methods and I cant get anything to work.. It needs to work with what i have..  a base strobe with a fullscreen button, launching the strobe into fulscreen, then I want the user to be greeted with a screen with a GUI that allows them to select the colours and then click to proceed..  also maybe a colour selector that is present while the strobe is running..  p  pAny suggestions will have to work with the functions and controls i already have in place, and if you can suggest the AS to use aswell, that would be awsome..  but just a bunch of ideas would be great also.p  pThanks, I look forward to reading some interesting ideas p

Negative 49895 pIn my opensource project a hrefhttpartha.sourceforge.net relnofollowArthaa I use a hrefhttpdevelopernext.gnome.orglibnotify relnofollowlibnotifya for showing passive desktop notifications to the user.p  pInstead of statically linking libnotify, a lookup at runtime is made for the shared object .so file via codedlloadcode, if available on the target machine, Artha exposes the notification feature in its GUI. On app. start, a call to codedlloadcode with filename param as codelibnotify.so.1code is made and if it returns a nonnull pointer, then the feature is exposed.p  pA recurring problem with this model is that every time the version number of the library is bumped, Arthas code needs to be updated, currently codelibnotify.so.4code is the latest to entail such an occurance.p  pIs there a linux system call irrespective of the distro the app. is running on, which can tell me if a particular librarys shared object is available at runtime I know that there exists the bruteforce option of enumerating the library by going from 1 to say 10, I find the solution ugly and inelegant.p  pAlso, if this can be addressed via a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareautoconfmanualautoconf.html relnofollowautoconfa, then that solution is welcome too I.e. at build time, based on the target machine, the configure.h generated shouldve the right .so name that can be passed to codedlloadcode.p  pstrongP.S.strong I think good distros follow the style of creating links to codelibnotify.so.xcode so that a programmer can just do codedlloadlibnotify.so, RTLDLAZYcode and the right version numbered .so is loaded unfortunately not all distros follow this, including Ubuntu.p
Negative 49895 pI have an application in which Im saving unknown structured data. So, lets assume for a moment there is a table in the database named codeFoocode and it looks like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Foo]      [Id] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,      [DataId] INT NOT NULL,      [Bar] VARCHAR50 NOT NULL,      CONSTRAINT [FKFooData] FOREIGN KEY [DataId] REFERENCES [Data][Id]  codepre  pAnd codeFoocode is related to a table named codeDatacode which is going to store the provider who logged the data as well as the date and time it was logged, and lets say that table looks like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Data]      [Id] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,      [ProviderId] INT NOT NULL,      [RecordDateTime] DATETIME NOT NULL,      CONSTRAINT [FKDataProvider] FOREIGN KEY [ProviderId] REFERENCES [Provider][Id]  codepre  pOkay, now lets assume that the provider which I have no knowledge of the data its providing has a class named codeFoocode that looks like thisp  precode[Serializable] public class Foo  ISerializable      private string bar      public string Bar              get  return bar          set  bar  value            public Foo              Bar  Hello World           public FooSerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context              this.bar  info.GetStringBar            public void GetObjectDataSerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context              info.AddValueBar, bar       codepre  pSo, when the provider sends me an instance of codeFoocode Im going to interrogate it and determine which table in the database it should be inserted into, and lets assume that code block looks like thisp  precodethis.connection.Open  try      var parameters  new                      ProviderId  registeredProvidersIdBySession[providerKey.ToString],             RecordDateTime  DateTime.Now,               var id  connection.QueryltintgtINSERT INTO Data ProviderId, RecordDateTime VALUES ProviderId, RecordDateTime SELECT CASTSCOPEIDENTITY as INT, parameters.Single      var t  data.GetType     var fields  t.GetPropertiesBindingFlags.Public  BindingFlags.Instance      var tableName  string.Format[0], t.Name     var fieldList  string.Join, , fields.Selectp gt string.Format[0], p.Name.ToArray      var valueList  fields.Selectp gt string.Format0, p.Name.ToList     valueList.Insert0, DataId      var values  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt     values.AddDataId, id     foreach var propertyInfo in fields              values.Addstring.Format0, propertyInfo.Name, propertyInfo.GetValuedata, null           return connection.Executestring.Format         INSERT INTO 0 1 VALUES 2,             tableName,             fieldList,             string.Join, , valueList.ToArray, values  finally      this.connection.Close  codepre  pNow as you can see, Im getting the codetableNamecode from the codeTypecode of the object passed to me. In our example thats codeFoocode. Further, Im gathering the list of fields to insert with reflection. However, the hitch in the get along is that codeDappercode requires an object be sent to it for the parameter values. Now, if I didnt need to provide the codeDataIdcode property on the type I could just pass in the object that was given to me, but I need that codeDataIdcode property so I can relate the log correctly.p  h2What am I Askingh2  ol liAm I going to have to create a dynamic type or can codeDappercode do something else to helpli liIf Im going to have to create a dynamic type, is there a more straight forward way than using the codeTypeBuildercode Ive done it before, and can do it again, but man its a pain.li liIf Im going to have to use the codeTypeBuildercode Id be interested in your example because you may know of a more efficient way than I do. So please include an example if you have some thoughts.li ol  h2DISCLAIMERh2  pIn the code example above you see I tried passing in a codeDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode instead but codeDappercode doesnt accept that. I pretty much knew it wouldnt because Id already looked at the source code, but I was just hoping I missed something.p  pThanks allp

Negative 49895 pIm using the following code in my bootstrap.php as explained a hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org2.0encoreutilitylibrariesapp.htmlApp3a3abuild relnofollowherea to load models also from another folderp  precodeAppbuildarrayModel gt arraymypathtomodels codepre  pThis emseemsem to work. I have a model emMyModelem inside that folder, which I include in the controller I want to use it like usuallyp  precodevar uses  arrayMyModel codepre  pIf I print strongAppobjectsModelstrong, the model emMyModelem is shown in the list, so I assume its loaded correctly. However, when I try to use the model i.e. strongthisMyModelfindstrong it never finds anything, it always returns an empty array.p  pNote that if I put the same exact model emMyModelem in the typical models folder strongappModelstrong then it all works fine.p  pWhat am I missing to make this workp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk, so it seems that the problem is in the connection to the database when the model is placed in that folder outside strongappstrong. With the code shown above, Cake finds the model. However, when I do a strongfindstrong, I get a strongmissing tablestrong error for the datasource strongdefaultstrong in this case.p  pIs it possible that the model isnt loading the correct database configuration because that configuration is inside the strongappConfigstrong folder How can I make that model load that configuration If I have to put that configuration somewehre else maybe in the same emoutsideem folder I can do that, but how do I tell the model to find itp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI can see better what the problem is now. If I put a model in a different folder other than strongappModelstrong and use strongAppbuildstrong to set the path of that new folder, Cake finds it, theres no doubt I use strongAppobjectsModelstrong and the model is listed with all the other models from strongappModelstrong.p  pHowever, its like Cake is not actually reading whats inside that model class, or at least not everything. It seems to read the stronguseDbConfigstrong variable, but it ignores stronguseTablestrong and any function I have defined in that model. Example of my modelp  precodeclass Usuario extends AppModel   var name  Usuario var primaryKey  idusuario  var useDbConfig  BDControlAcceso  function createTempPasswordlen       some code   codepre  pIf I do a strongthisUsuariofindallstrong, it returns all the records correctly. However, if I call strongthisUsuariocreateTempPassword7strong I get a strongDatabase Errorstrong.p  pI have another model MyModel in that same folder with a stronguseTable  mytablestrong. If I don a strongfindstrong on it, I get an error saying that strongemmytableem table could not be foundstrong. However, if I do strongthisMyModeluseTable  mytablestrong then it works fine.p  pHow is this possible Whats going on herep  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI just want to add that Ive done extensive testing and the issue is clear Cake knows that the model is in the external folder confirmed by printing strongAppobjectsModelstrong, the model is listed there, and if I remove it from that folder then its not listed. But even though it knows its there, strongit ignores whatever is inside the model filestrong. Ive tried all the methods below to load the model but none of them worked. Is this a bug in CakePHP If not, what am I doing wrong p
Negative 49895 pI have a big YAML file that stores test cases for my app. It uses a lot of anchors and alias to share parts among test cases. It was initially ok to manage, but it now seems to have outgrown from what we can easily edit. p  pIt is now really difficult to see where each keys refers to or what are the actual values we will see after it gets parsed. So my question is if there is any handy way to look at how YAML will be parsed associated with where each value comes from. p  pFor instance, when my YAML is like sop  precode1 testcase1 ampbasecase 2   casecomponenta foo 3   casecomponentb bar 4 testcaseexpectation1 ampbaseexpectation 5   expectationcomponenta foofoo 6   expectationcomponentb barbar 7 testcaseset1 8   ltlt basecase 9   ltlt baseexpectation codepre  pis there any handy way to view this in something like the following wayp  precodetestcaseset1    casecomponenta foo  from ampbasecase line2   casecomponentb bar  from ampbasecase line3   expectationcomponenta foofoo  from ampbaseexpectation line5   expectationcomponentb barbar  from ampbaseexpectation line6 codepre  pWhat is the best practice for creating maintainable, extensible and readable files when there are several hundred or more data records Is there any guidance in the YAML specificationp

Negative 49895 pRelated to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12369967playframework2readtheapplicationversiondefinedinbuildscalathis questiona, is there a best place to store version information so it is accessible within Play 2 project and not duplicated We have multiple application.conf files each developer has one so thats not a great place for version information for us. Also the SBT buildInfo plugin seems like overkill for a simple version number.p  pA comment at the end of the linked question says to store version info in Global.java, then it will be accessible in your play app such as to display in your footer. Can you then ignore program nameversion in Build.scala and just maintain your actual nameversion in Global.javap

Negative 49895 pI searched many questions which asked related information, but the answers didnt quiet match exactly what I wanted for an answer. Ill try to explain the issue as best I can.p  pBasically when running the code in release mode the compiler seems to remove most code that is redundant or dead code. So it ends up checking nothing. Some fixes were to make the code stored to some variable, but then the compile just removes the looping and stores that last increment it seems.p  pNow I do wish to have the optimizations made which improve the code used, but I still want everything it was originally doing E.g. If I made it loop the code 100,000 times I expect it to actually perform the code 100,000 times. Im not sure how to modify the compiler on Visual Studio 2010 so that It does the minimal optimizations when compiling in release mode. I very much would like to accurately time something, but Im not sure how to accurately time somthing.p  pAt first I thought running in debug without debugging might fix the issue and it very much seemed to since the results matched that of a Java application, but when running in release mode the results where insanely faster which confuses me. Im not sure if C is just that much better in the optimizations or if a large amount of code has been changed.p  pIs there any way to also dissemble the code possibly and view what the compile compiled the code into This would be another test Id like to see, but I dont know much about this stuff and anything in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Alright well thanks to anyone who can somewhat understand what Im asking for. Ill be glad to reply to any questions regarding any misunderstanding or uncertaintys on the question at hand. p

Negative 49895 pI have some trouble in developing a Linux driver for an underwater acoustic modem. The general idea of my project is to bring IPv6 to the underwater network. The expected result is that the underwater sensor network will have access from any typical internet devices. To achieve and implement my target, I have to provide the modem a driver so that I can use the routing protocols provided by the Linux kernel. However, due to the differences of underwater communication and typical RF communication, I have to do some processes on the packets, including fragmenting, header compressing and mesh routing. But all these process should be transparent, and the modem should be used as any other network interfaces.p  pThe modem can communicate with computer with serial port. But I have to use the pl2303 USB to serial converter to connect it. Also the device which drives the modem is not only computer, but also an embedded Linux system called Gumstix.   I tried several different ways to do it, but I cannot achieve my final goal.p  pThe first solution is to make a pure user mode driver. It can be easy to handle but I cannot create an interface like eth0, and I cannot ping through it. Whats worse, I have to implement all the IPv6 standard by myself, which I believe is actually a waste of time.p  pThe second solution is to make a pure kernel mode driver. The advantage is that I can exploit the existed code to deal with the IPv6 and upper level stuff, and I can have a beautiful interface.  But it is not recommended to open serial port as a file in kernel mode. Although I have tried to do that, I always receives some garbage bytes.p  pLater I have tried a third solution. I make a daemon program that sends and receives from the serial port and use a net link socket to communication with the driver in the kernel. I wonder if any driver is doing so. But if any user wants to use my driver, they have to compile for their device and start it up by hand. Moreover, the interprocess communication is not reliable and I have no idea if the kernel has received my packet.p

Negative 49895 pI need hints. I created two tables in the database, and each table has a column called number of quantity. I formed the number of quantity into text, so the user can enter the number of quantity. I did looping through the first table and showed the result of the whole table in a gridview by clicking the button for looping. All i need to know is, how to insert or add the number of quantity, that the user enters via a button in another table, so i can find it checked in the tables record.  p

Negative 49895 pI know the title is a little confusing but the problem is very straight forward. I am using codeEntity Frameworkcode and codeCode Firstcode approach. I have those two entities with relation 1N. The uniqueness of the records comes from the combination of two columns  codeCodecode  codeCountryIDcode. First I thought that codeCodecode itself will be unique files so my query for getting distinct records was looking like thisp  precodeIListltSoleColorgt soles  SoleColorService.All                 .GroupByx gt x.Sole.Code                 .Selectg gt g.FirstOrDefault                 .ToList codepre  pBut now it occurs that doing so I lose those records where the codeCodecode or to be exact  the codeSole.Codecode is the same but the codeCountryIDcode is different. What I need is to change my query so it returns all records where codeCodecode  codeCountryIDcode is unique.p

Negative 49895 pI cannot remove an installation temp directory 19a5e95b7185dd381eea and all its sub directories after a successful VS 2010 installation. The OS is Win 7 Sp1. I have Admin privileges. I tried to remove it in Safe Mode with no avail. I cannot change privileges for these directories to delete them. Its read only directory. Its large enough to ignore. How can I delete itp  pSolutionp  pBased on Dereks suggestion, I had to add myself as owner to all sub directories individually. If there is a way to do on the root, if would be easier. After the ownership is given, it was possible to delete all the directories.p  pMicrosoft should create a proper deployment for VS2010 that cleans itself afterp

Negative 49895 pIm reading N3485 C Standard Draft and in the section on alignment, it states the followingp  pstrong3.11 Alignment [basic.align]strongp  blockquote   p1 ...    An alignment is an implementationdefined integer value representing   the number of bytes between successive addresses at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment requirement on every object of that type strongstricter alignment can be requested using the alignment specifierstrong 7.6.2.p blockquote  pHere it states what alignment is, and I get that.  It means that if you have 32 bit 4byte system, it will read in 4 byte size chunks at a time, so you should place things in memory at 4 byte offset addresses. A lot of this is handled by a good compiler, however C lets you have your say in it too.p  pThe alignmentspecifier it speaks of is codealignascode.p  pYou can pass an integer to codealignascode to specify your alignment requirement or a type like codealignasdoublecodep  pNow, you have weak or strict alignment, which is stated to be the followingp  blockquote   p5 Alignments have an order from emweaker to stronger or stricterem   alignments. strongStricter alignments have larger alignment values.strong An   address that satisfies an alignment requirement also satisfies any   weaker valid alignment requirement.p      p7 Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious resultsp      p Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal. p      p Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal. p      p emWhen an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.emp blockquote  pSo here it states that a stricter alignment is a larger alignment.  Does that just mean that codealignas8code is more strict than codealignas4code  On a 32 bit 4 byte system, the 8 version would mean that codeintcode type would require two reads instead of one, and one with just padding.  Is the strict referring to the fact that it imposes potential overhead on the CPU, when alignment is misused, as in this silly examplep  pI realize that not all alignments are valid on a given system, and that extended alignments have to be valid in order to produce correct behavior.  p  pTo me alignment is about letting the CPU access memory data in word size chunks, which is the most optimal way for a CPU to fetch and write data to and from memory.p  pThis strict alignment, as I understand it, could potentially ruin that. Am I wrong What is strict alignment vs weak alignment  p

Negative 49895 pAs always, Im probably missing something obvious here. I cant post the entire source code, because its workrelated but I have a templated codeMatrixcode class with a codemulMMcode multiply Matrix by Matrix function and a codemulMTcode function multiply matrix by transpose matrix. That already exists in the code. I am trying to add a codemulMTcode function that specializes for single precision Floating point values.

Here is some example codep  precodeifdef TARGETx86SSE4  template ltgt  MatrixltFloatgtamp  MatrixltFloatgtmulMM const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat1,                                        const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat2  template ltgt  MatrixltFloatgtamp  MatrixltFloatgtmulMT const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat1,                                        const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat2,                                       const bool softmax  endif  no SSE4 use template generic  template ltclass BTgt  MatrixltBTgtamp  MatrixltBTgtmulMM const MatrixltBTgtamp mat1,                                  const MatrixltBTgtamp mat2     Function code   template ltclass BTgt  MatrixltBTgtamp  MatrixltBTgtmulMT const MatrixltBTgtamp mat1,                                  const MatrixltBTgtamp mat2,                                 const bool softmax     Function code  codepre  pThen, in a separate filep  precodeifdef TARGETx86SSE4  template ltgt  MatrixltFloatgtamp  MatrixltFloatgtmulMM const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat1,                                        const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat2     Function code   template ltgt  MatrixltFloatgtamp  MatrixltFloatgtmulMT const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat1,                                        const MatrixltFloatgtamp mat2,                                        const bool softmax     Function code  codepre  pWhen I invoke the code, the mulMM correctly pulls in the values of the input matrices, but when I invoke mulMT, I wind up with random numbers for the dimensions of the matrix. Using the debugger, I can see that the matrix is properly defined when coming in, but as soon as Ive stepped into the function, the values are all wrong. Here is some example code Im usingp  precodeMatrixFloat mA4, 5 MatrixFloat mB5, 4  Code to initialize mA and mBs values.  MatrixFloat mR  mR.mulMMmA, mB  This works fine and correctly find the values for the product.  MatrixFloat mC4, 4  Code to initialize mC mR  mR.mulMTmC, mC  This fails with a memory access error and stepping into the function reveals   that this seems to be because mC has dimensions of 84376 x 1 or thereabouts codepre  pI have tried making the two values into MT different. Ive verified that, when my mulMT for Floats isnt present, the generic one works. I dont know why this is doing what its doing.p  pstrongEditstrong In an effort to prove that the code inside the Float specialization was not the issue, I commented it out. Everything worked. I uncommented the code. Everything still works. Im thinking that maybe Visual Studio just got confused and did not recompile something.p  pstrongFurther Editstrong OK... this is very strange. When debugging, when I first step into mulMT, it drops me onto the line with codeconst bool softmax code. If I try F10, I get the exception. If I hit F11, it drops me into codeChkStk.asmcode. If I exit out of that file, Im able to access the inside of the function and everything is allocated correctly. In fact, as long as I dont recompile my test program, I can step through or run as many times as I like without error. However, if I make a change to my test program and recompile, the behavior comes back.p  pI am even more confused than I was at the start.p  pstrongEditstrong OK, after two days with no issues, its come up again. I think that it is not, as I thought before, something involving the values changing. Instead, its something happening before the parameters are actually instantiated. Thing is, I dont know why still, other than that this is the only function I have which drops me into codestkchk.asmcode if I hit codeF11code after entering the function.p  pemFirstchance exception at 0x00789adc in UnitTest.exe 0xC0000005 Access violation reading location 0xabababab.em is the exception I get. Earlier in the function, I make an almost identical call, only varying which variables are used with the operator. Oddly enough, a trycatch block around the call does nothing to prevent the program from crashing.p

Negative 49895 pIm sending automated emails and hence I should deliver an unsubscribe function.

Negative 49895 pI have been experiencing some major caching and lazy loading problems with NHibernate using C and ASP.NET. It was not until we enabled caching that this begun. In many situations we have to write code to null out an object and to a fresh get in order to preserve the wanted properties, otherwise documents are generated with invalid information or objects are saved and overwrite the most current data. p  pOther times, lazy loading has fails to fetch data and throws an exception. In these cases it is always an object with a one to many relationship. So we have and object with an IList property and when we hit a foreach loop, it throws an exception stating that it could not lazily load the collection. In these cases we simply do a getById of the object and instantiate a new object. p  pBelow is the psuedocode for a couple work arounds I have resorted to using. These work in most cases, however, I should not have to be writing this extra code. p  pfor threaded applicationsp  precodeThread thread  new Threadnew ThreadStart gt GetObjectNotFromCacheobjectGuid, out object             thread.Start             thread.Join  private static void  GetObjectNotFromCacheGuid objectId, out Object object              var db  new db  auto generated file that handles CRUD operations         object db.GetObjectByIdobjectId      codepre  pfor web appp  precodevar db  new db             object  db.GetObjectByIdobjectId             object  null             object  db.GetObjectByIdobjectId codepre  pOur Session Manager enables caching by the followingp  precode public static ISession OpenSession              ISession session         if CurrentSessionContext.HasBindGetFactory                      session  GetFactory.GetCurrentSession                  return session      codepre  pThese hacks are allowing us to continue development, however, they slow us down tremendously. Can anyone help identify where this problem may be happening One more thing to note is that on save of an object we evict the current session.

Negative 49895 pMy question is related to a design issue...p  pSo I take as input from the user his couchbase URL, bucket name in which he wants to keep his doucments, Ramquota etc etc ... p  pBut when he has multiple tables which he wants to replicate in Couchbaseused as caching layer on Oracle DB... How should I represent table in it ... I mean buckets cant be equivalent to tables coz multiple buckets decrease performance. Also, for doc ID i use the primary key of the table the user is refering to, but then, even though there is a table name in the JSON which he can use in the view to query, if two tables have same IDs it would be a conflict ... So do I create primarykey  table name as the DOcumentID ... Or how do you represent tables in couchbase so that quering is easy for READS.p  precodeenter code heretable gj2, type insert, id 3, name xyz codepre  pSo here primary key for table gj2 is id which I also use as document ID in bucket default , and I cant create multiple buckets for each tables ... So if now a second table comes with same primary key value  3 ... It wont add it.p

However, it does not work without the strongfflushstdoutstrong after LINE 1. The problem is that I would not be able to put strongfflushstrong in the program which I am planning to run.p  hr  pI am trying to start another program from my process. I dont have access to its code but I know it uses stdin and stdout for user interaction. I am trying to start that program by creating 2 pipes, forking and redirecting the childs stdinstdout to the proper pipe ends. The points is that the parent should be able communicate with the child via file descriptors, while its stdinstdout should be intact. The POPEN syscall only opens unidirectional pipe. The following code almost works. p  pThere are 4 lines marked as LINE 1..4.p  pLINE 1 is child sending to pipe, LINE 2 is child receiving from pipe, LINE 3 is parent sending to pipe, LINE 4 is parent receiving from pipe,p  pThis is just a toy example to make sure things work.

Negative 49895 pSo, this has been a huge struggle for us. We have a web API .net MVC4 backend. We are using angular for clientside.  We have a page that has some JSON that we receive data from.  When we make a GET to this page we receive data.  As soon as we add custom headers to the call the GET turns into OPTIONS and we get a 200, with no response. We are doing a couple things like creating a BASE64 code on login storing it as a cookie and trying to add that to the GET headers.  the thing is we have stripped out all of the unnecessary code and we are still at the same problem.  Even with authorization turned off for the data.  Here is the GET codep  precodemyApp.factoryprojectDataService, function http, location, cookieStore  var token   token  cookieStore.gettoken  return        getProject function successcb          http method GET, url httpdev.projnik.comapiproject, headers  Authorization Basic   token  .        successfunction data, status, headers, config             successcbdata        .        errorfunction data, status, headers, config             console.logdata, status, headers, config             ,     save function project          http method POST, url httpdev.projnik.comapiproject, data .paramproject .          successfunction data, status               if status  201                   location.pathall                                 codepre  pp  pAnd the app.jsp  precodevar myApp  angular.moduleProject, [ngResource, ngCookies]  myApp.configfunctionrouteProvider     routeProvider.         whennew, templateUrltemplatesnew.html, controllerEditProjectController.         whenmobile, templateUrltemplatesmobile.html, controllerProjectController.         whenit, templateUrltemplatesit.html, controllerProjectController.         whenwriting, templateUrltemplateswriting.html, controllerProjectController.         whenall,  templateUrl templatesall.html .         whencookie,  templateUrl partialscookiecontrollerhtml.html .         whenlogin,  templateUrl partialslogin.html .         otherwise redirectTo all    myApp.config[httpProvider, functionhttpProvider  httpProvider.defaults.useXDomain  true  delete httpProvider.defaults.headers.common[XRequestedWith]  ] codepre  pAgain, without adding headers attribute to the call, everything works obviously we get a 401 with Authorization turned on in the API.  We are willing to pay for an answer at this point.p  pWe are exposing our actual domains here, and that is fine.  If someone goes to www.projnik.com and clicks the login link on the top and enter shane, password for username,password they would receive the cookie and it routes the user back to the all page where they would GET the data, though it doesnt work.p  pPS I have tried to ad withCredentials  true to the call and I get the same result.p

Negative 49895 pIt seems like lately I have been having been getting hung up on the autocompletion drop down when using the console in Chrome DevTools. It seems like it has suddenly gotten more aggressive. I have never had a problem with the feature until the other day when I was trying to enter commands into the console quickly in order to test things. I wasnt sure why it wasnt working right. when Id hit kbdEnterkbd autocompletion kept popping up and not executing what I typed. At first it seems as if autocompletion was activating whenever I would hit kbdEnterkbd to execute my code. However, it began to look like it was only popping up when I would end a statement with codecode.p  pFor example, typing the following statement into the console and pressing kbdEnterkbd would not cause the autocomplete drop down to activatep  precodeconsole.logdid it codepre  pHowever, if I add a semicolon then as soon as I press kbdkbd a number of milliseconds later the autocompletion feature immediately pops upp  precodeconsole.logdid it codepre  pAt this point if I press kbdEnterkbd it will simply select the first entry, codecode, and add it as the next statement so we getp  precodeconsole.logdid it codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqI5u0.png altAutocompletion preventing executionp  pI know this is not really a big deal, after all, the only reason you would need the semicolon is for entering in multiple statements. However, I feel like in the past Ive always added a semicolon codecode to the end of simple single test statements such as the codeconsole.logcode shown above not activated the autocompletion, being able to execute it by just hitting kbdEnterkbd.p  pI definitely feel like emmyem consoles autocompletion is being activated more aggressive than it used to.p  pstrongHas anyone else felt like the autocompletion in the console is activating too often all of the suddenstrong I am wondering whether or not this could have actually been changed in Chrome or if somehow I have made my console start acting this way with a setting or somethingp  pWhile writing this I noticed that it seems not to only be after codecode that autocompletion seems to pop up when it hadnt before.

Negative 49895 pCase I need to find out if three combinations of objects will satisfy a rule.p  pFor the sake of simplicity, lets say the rule is satisfied if the a given sequence is in any combination of items that are spit out by a generator function.

So project A.dll contains the COM interface, project B.dll contains the COM class that implements this interface.p  pThis C COM component is then registered using regasm from some folder on my system, say for example CTestComponent which contains A.dll amp B.dll, B being the one registered using regasm.p  pWhen my native C application COM server, which is installed in another path, is trying to create an instance of the C COM class from project B this fails complaining that A.dll can not be found.p  pIf I copy only A.dll to the installation directory of my native C app, everything works perfectly.p  pAny ideas on how to tell my native C app that it needs to find the A.dll in a specified directory or in the directory where B.dll residesp  pKind regards, Dwightp

Negative 49895 pPresently, I am working on a particular requirement where I need to execute a command on the underlying system using ProcessBuilder. Till now the case was simply limited to supplying commands to a ProcessBuilder instance along with the working directory. Now, I need to handle cases where a commands execution hangs up expecting a users response to proceed further with the execution. Usually, the execution throws up some custom questions which the user needs to answer to proceed further.p  pI cant be really sure about the questions or the sequence in which they are asked, hence, passing an additional parameter in the ProcessBuilder is not an option.  p  pHow do we handle such scenarios  Does ProcessBuilder throw some events to notify of such temporary halts  Is there any other approach which helps with this particular case If ProcessBuilder can not handle the jobp  pThanksp

Negative 49895 pI have a problem Id like to code. I have a process which generates numbers 0 through n1 and I want to stop it when it generates the first repeated element. Im looking for a data structure that makes this fast. In particular, adding a new element and testing if an element is in the structure need to be fast. The expected number of insertions is around sqrtn birthday problem or actually a bit worse say sqrt2n because the process slightly favors unique values. In other words, it is rather sparse  working with the numbers up to a billion only about 30 or 50 thousand values will be used.p  pA hash set or some kind of selfbalancing binary tree seems like the right approach, but maybe theres a better way For small n I think a bit array would be superior but Im looking at n around 109 which is too large for that to be practical I think.p  pii Actually, it doesnt need to stop right away  if its more efficient you can generate elements in blocks and check every now and then.p  hr  pemNote This was originally posted on math.se but they recommended that I repost here.

Negative 49895 pFrom everything that I have seen about strongneural networks and genetic algorithmsstrong, I have noticed a few things p  pNNs are very good at converging to a solution after a certain number of iterations. GAs are good at finding a solution to a problem after a certain number of generations. However there is one timecomplexity obstacle at play here, and that is the actual construction of the neural network and genetic algorithm itself. This is where the actual skill and understanding comes in  the consideration of nodes, weights, activation functions etc. For genetic algorithms its the fitness function, error values etc. This is all determined by the problem domain itself.p  pMy strongproposalstrong is to find a generalized algorithm that can take the problem statement such as create a program that simulates a netball game and finds optimal strategies for effective play, and CREATE THE NEURAL NETWORK OR GENETIC ALGORITHM ITSELF using a combination of databases, statistics, classification systems, logic, decision theory, mathematics.p  pOne possible approach to at least partially solve the problem is having a database of problem domains, and an existing neural network and ga for that problem.p  pThe database could have the following attributes p  precodeProblem statement  VARCHAR,  Problem domain     VARCHAR,  numLayers          INT, NNTree             TREE,  numNodes           INT,  activationFunct    LIST codepre  pAs the user specifies the program statement, the program must break it up into its elements. For eg , Netball simulator that learn the effective strategy of the game,p  pis broken up into Netball [ Rules of game are known ], simulator [ implies 2d or 3d graphics, predefined objects for graphics ], effective [ interpreted as optimal, which influences that activation function used], strategy [ interpreted as emergent behaviour of objects ], game [ interpreted as goal oriented action list ]p  blockquote   pWhat data structures or algorithms are needed for this p blockquote

Negative 49895 pemUpdate Ive found that if you fire a WF after its rebooted it will then complete  current In Progress WFs.

Once I reboot, all current running WFs stay in the InProgress status and the Resume option is greyed out in AppFabric IIS. I have found a very similar article on here to my problem but after going through their solutions I am no further forward stronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5622680wf4workflowunderappfabricnotresumingproperlyafteriisresetWF4 Workflow under AppFabric not resuming properly after IISresetastrongp  pstrongFurther Informationstrongp  pI have 2 applications one is a web UI to fire the workflow and one is for the service which I then monitor with AppFabric in IIS. I have been through the Manage WCF and WF Services Configuration and have set the default connectionstring for Persistence  ensuring it persists. Also made sure the Persist when Idle amp Unload checkboxes are ticked for every 60 seconds this has been done at Server level and Application level in the tree node of IIS. p  pWhen I dont reboot, the WF will persist, resume and complete as intended, it is only when I reboot the VM. The workflow itself isnt anything special. It simply receives the data an integer for the delay in minutes from the UI, writes a text file to confirm the WF is running, then has the delay via a general Delay Activity TimeSpan.FromMinutesinteger and finishes with writing another text file to confirm its completed. Ive been into the WF Instance but can only Terminate, Suspend or Delete the instance.p  pAnyone have ideas or thoughts p  pThanksp

Negative 49895 pI have not gone through the code detail of node.js .p  pBut, going through some research about thread in  Node.js, I found that it has single thread for accepting connection from multiple clients.p  pWhen connected with client it fires connection events and listens for another client and work fully in asynchronous style  and  rest operation of client  request  is performed from thread pool and result is sent back to main threadThread that accepts connection via callback.p  pLike wise in Java NIO also ServerSocketChannel,SocketChannel can be set in  nonblocking mode and with selector single thread can  monitor multiple channels. So, using NIO ServerSocketChannel,SocketChannel also from single thread the connection can be managed asynchronously for multiple clients p  pSo, is the NIOs nonblocking mode and  node.js asynchronous with single thread  follows the same pattern for concept of single thread As both say they perform on single thread.p

Negative 49895 pRecently I had to replace a single container with a collection of similar containers. As a result, I needed a combined iterator retaining the semantics of the original iterator. The problem that I ran into was the handling of the combined end position. Without the ability to compare unassigned iterators, I had to include all four iterators as members i.e. the two ranges, external and internal. This resulted in operator requiring three comparisons in the most common case. This, of course, is much worse than comparison in the ordinary nested loops which require single comparison in the most common case. Beside that I noticed that the four iterator code is prone to errors, because keeping the end iterators in the combined iterator may lead to skipping the exit condition of the for loop if container contents changes inside the loop. Here is a sketch of the code I usedp  precode   template ltclass Tgt    class MyContainer           typedef stdvectorltTgt Inner       typedef stdvectorltInnergt Outer       Outer v    public       class iterator                 friend class MyContainer          Outeriterator it1, it1end          Inneriterator it2, it2end          iteratorOuteriterator it1, Outeriterator it1end              it1it1, it1endit1end                       ifit1it1end                 it2  it1gtbegin                it2end  it1gtend                              public          bool operatoriterator it const              return it1it.it1 ampamp                it1it1end  it2it.it2                         iterator begin  return iteratorv.begin, v.end        iterator end  return iteratorv.end, v.end      codepre  pTaking into account these considerations, is there a way to implement the nested iterator semantics without having to store both end values or without the need to have three comparisons in the operatorp

Negative 49895 pIs it possible to force Android to kill the entire apps process instead of destroying activities which run in the background Because, I dont want the system to recreate the destroyed activities since the app wont work correctly in this case. Thus, I think its more userfriendly to kill the entire process so the user will simply start the app again and everything works as is should. The solution should not affect normal resuming when the activity is still running in background..p  pregardsp

Negative 49895 pFirst, a definition of replaced element a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS21conform.htmlreplacedelement relnofollowfrom W3a p  blockquote   h2Replaced elementh2      pAn element whose content is outside the scope of the   CSS formatting model, such as an image, embedded document, or applet.   For example, the content of the HTML IMG element is often replaced by   the image that its src attribute designates. Replaced elements often   have intrinsic dimensions an intrinsic width, an intrinsic height,   and an intrinsic ratio. For example, a bitmap image has an intrinsic   width and an intrinsic height specified in absolute units from which   the intrinsic ratio can obviously be determined. On the other hand,   other documents may not have any intrinsic dimensions for example, a   blank HTML document.p      pUser agents may consider a replaced element to not have any intrinsic   dimensions if it is believed that those dimensions could leak   sensitive information to a third party. For example, if an HTML   document changed intrinsic size depending on the users bank balance,   then the UA might want to act as if that resource had no intrinsic   dimensions.p      pThe content of replaced elements is not considered in the CSS   rendering model.p blockquote  pIt doesnt seem to concern codelabelcode, rightp  pThen, Ive seen a hrefhttpdemosthenes.infoblog461WhatTheHeckIsAReplacedElement relnofollowthis blog posta, which gives this one rule p  blockquote   pYou cannot apply generated content to replaced elements.

Negative 49895 pI am trying to set up a RabbitMQ cluster with mirrored queues nevermind if u dont know what that is, it MIGHT NOT affect the answer. Long story short, I have emNem RabbitMQ instances joined together in a cluster. One of the instances is the master, the remaining are slaves   sorry about the terminology but thats what is on the RabbitMQ docs  but they are active. However, I need to come up with a proxying solution that does the followingp  ol liRoute ALL TCP connections to the master.li liShould the master fail, reroute all TCP connections to a new master  one of the slaves will be promoted to master in that scenario.li liNo load balancing  all connections MUST go to the master original or new.li ol  pTrouble is HAProxy seems to always work as a load balancer which is not applicable here, it is just here to provide failover support. How can I turn load balancing off but still keep failover support onp

Negative 49895 pCan someone please explain to me why the following code returns an infinite loop rather than redefining codefoocodep  precodevar foo  2  while foo  2     foo  3   console.logfoo is   foo codepre  pOf course, the first time through the loop is going to run because codefoocode indeed equals code2code. However, I dont understand why to keeps running after the first time through codefoocode should now be set to 3, the parameter should return false, and codeconsole.logfoo is   foocode should print codefoo is 3code.p  pClearly I am missing something here.p
Negative 49895 pIm quite new to AngularJS and NodeJS. Im trying to develop an app using MEAN stack. I just looked through the sample code in the mean.io boilerplate.

When Ill be coding my application Id like to prepopulate the database which will be rebuilt each time I buildrunpublish the app as I am understanding CodeFirst. First that came to mind was to create a codeinitialdata.sqlcode script file with a bunch of insertsupdates on tables which will be fired up every buildrunpublish of my app. It may work with small initial data set, but what when I would have to modify the application, which already would have a larger set of data in the database p  pHow can I include my codeinitialdata.sqlcode file each time Database is being rebuilt  and second questionbr How I can CodeFirst on an existing database preserving records that are already in therep

Negative 49895 pI have a storyboard that needs to be internationalized and I want to determine if base internationalization would be of any use.p  pI plan to send only strings file to the translators and base internationalization allows text in storyboards to be localized using strings files, as opposed to having storyboard copies for each language. The drawback I see is that the generated string keyvalue pairs look something like thisp  blockquote   pCT6MlBFU.title  Bankp blockquote  pwhere CT6MlBFU is something called the objectID. Now if I were to send these files to the translators there would not be enough context to translate the strings.

In a different language the two words might not be homonyms and different words would be used for the two meanings. Without context information its impossible to translate.p  pThe problem is that the string key value gives no information about where this string occurs, unless you have access to the storyboard and know how to search inside it.p  pIs there any way to define custom string keys or do I ultimately have to set the strings manually from codep

Negative 49895 pWhen drawing onto a canvas in a codeViewcodes codeonDrawcode method you dont know about any scale factor of its parent.

This is due to codeonDrawcode providing a canvas to draw to that does not reflect this scale factor. That said the canvas always keeps the same dimensions regardless of its final destination. Thus child views do not have the chance to provide higher resolution drawings when their parents are being scaled up. This obviously leads to scaling artifacts.p  pYou can observe the same behavior when you scale a buttons parent viewp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compfaXa.png altButton with parent unscaled img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIwVF0.png altButton with parent scaled 5xp  pIs there any chance to respect all parents transformations when drawing onto child views Or is this a general limitation when drawing onto canvases in a view hierarchy where view parents can have a scale factornot equal to1.p  pIn my use case it is not an option to forward the scale change to all children instead of applying it to the parent. This is due to the fact that there some of those children have animations that modify the scale factor. Hence these animations would override any scale change.p

Negative 49895 pI have a onepage website  based on a twitterbootstrap setup  that is almost complete. Ive just heavily modified a themeforest theme, so I cant take credit for how the page works. Ive discovered an issue where the website, when viewed on a mobile or tablet, has almost the top 23 of the page unable to be used scrolled or clicked on by a touch device. You can test it here a hrefhttpgoudkamp.stacklaw.com.au relnofollowhttpgoudkamp.stacklaw.com.aua.p  pIf I remove or comment out the modals that have recently been introduced for the privacy disclaimer and the peoples email buttons, the page scroll and touch works as expected. please ignore the nonmobile friendly sections that I havent yet fixed the CSS up to make responsive An example of the same page without the modals is a hrefhttpgoudkamp.stacklaw.com.auindex2.php relnofollowhttpgoudkamp.stacklaw.com.auindex2.phpa where you can see that touch control is working fine.p  pNow, here lies my problem... because the site is based on a prebuilt theme and Im not the most competent debugger when it comes to jquery, I dont know how to fix this issue. I really like the idea of the modals, so Id love some guidance on how to correct the problem rather than find an alternative way to show the popups.p  pThanks in advance. Reecep
Negative 49895 pYesterday, I was preparing to run an app that has worked perfectly for weeks when I accidentally pushed the debug button instead of the run button. While before I had 0 errors now I have over 20. All of them have to do with not resolving the R class anymore. p  pI have combed stackoverflow and tried many of the fixes but to no avail. I have tried cleaning, rebuilding, syncing, manually importing then rebuilding etc etc. Most of those fixes come from last year anyway. I am using version 0.5.2. I am new to Android development and Android studio and stackoverflow for that matter so I apologize if this question is trivial or has been answered before. p  pSolvedp  pThere was an undisclosed error in a string resource.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4414389androidxmlpercentsymbolAndroid XML Percent Symbolap  p...is roughly equivalent to my mistake.p

Negative 49895 pI am writing a template class that wraps around member functions to reduce some calls  if some condition is true, the member function doesnt need to be called. The signature would look something like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename MemFuncType, MemFuncTypegt class MemberWrapper codepre  pAnd I can specialize it thusp  precodetemplate lttypename R, typename T, R T MemFuncgt class MemberWrapperltR T, MemFuncgt codepre  pI would also like to restrict the number of arguments of codeR Tcode. How do I do thisp  pThe only solution I can think of is to implement a member functions traits class by providing partial specializations based on return type, function type, arguments list and cvqualifiers. This would lead to a cumbersome implementation like the current codestdmemfncode a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcpputilityfunctionalmemfn relnofollowoverloadsa. Is there a way of doing it betterp  pEDIT  Changed codeRetcode to codeRcode. As pointed out in the comments, it isnt really the return type and the specialization was invalid.p

Negative 49895 pI think my stackoverflow searchfu is broken today, because it cant be that Im the only one whos ever asked this. Cripes, I hope not, because I could really use some help figuring this out. Switching between datasources is the big part, but best way to abstract is the logical nextquestion on this, too.p  pAnyway I have something like three dozen widgets. Each widget has one of three data sources APIfull, APIshort, json file. Ill have users just coming in from the intarnets, users with a salesprovided temporary login, and users whove logged in with their own API key.p  ol lino login  dummy datajsonli litemp login  data from abridged endpointli liAPI key  full data set endpointli ol  pLogicking this out, Ill have scope.access for user access  scope.widget for which widget the user clicked. Falling back on old functional habits, it seems like I could use those two in a case break, and return a value for the appropriate endpoint. But I cant seem to get a variable to work the http call, like thisp  precodehttp.getscope.call.successfunctiondata      scope.group  data  codepre  pSo my question boils down to p  pWhats the best way or can I reuse an http with a variable, so I can just insert the variable and not have to do a separate http for every combinationp  pHow should I or should I abstract this logic and get this out of my controller p  pWhat would be really excellent is just something I could call in my controller, maybe like sop  precodevar X  getEndpointscope.access, scope.widget var Y  getEndpointscope.access, scope.widget var Z  getEndpointscope.access, scope.widget codepre  pand the rest be hidden under the hood elsewhere. Any ideas on how to tackle this p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 49895 pI have inherited a Oracle Apex project and I am a newbie to apex development. p  pMy work is primarily on WebSphere server but I need the Oracle Apex application on my machine. The setup of my development machine isp  ol liOracle 11G enterprise versionli liTomcat for Apexli liWebsphere Application Server 8.5li ol  pThere is a strange issue happening. When the apex login page is run it gives an error message Error    Error processing request. ORA06502 PLSQL numeric or value errorp  pBut the moment I run my WebSphere application the apex application also starts running properly. Both the Apex application and WebSphere application point to the same database. I connect from my Websphere application using Oracle thin driver.p  pThe apex team says that there is no dependency on the WAS application server.  I suspect something gets started when I run my Websphere application which helps the apex application to start working properly. I am not able to figure out what causes everything in Apex to run properly when the  Websphere application starts.p  pHow can I debug what is going wrong when my apex application is running independently. I have asked the apex team to help me out in debugging. My expectation is that when the apex application it must be logging the error message in some logfile or table. Any pointers on debugging will help.p

For instance, if I change Region from codeUnited Kingdomcode to codeItalycode, the bug strongdoesntstrong occur.p  pIve been developing a macro that runs an codeAppleScriptcode, that in turn runs a shell script, to change the setting using the defaults utility.

But Excel only picks up this change if I then restart the application. However, if I make the change to the Region setting using the System Preferences GUI, then I dont need to restart Excel for it to recognise the change.p  pI really want to avoid GUI Scripting, so Im wondering if some clever bod out there might know why this scripted change isnt recognised.

If I omit that function, the program console.logs the data ok and the datepicker is still useable. p  pHowever, the second I try to append a div to wrapper, the datepicker breaks. The text box still has the class .hasdatepicker. Ive tried datepickerdestroy and removing the .hasdatepicker class before reassigning it, but none of those things will fix my problem. Ive also made sure to set the zindexes correctly so that the datepicker has a higher one. I moved the div aside at one point just to make sure there wasnt some odd zindexnotworking problem, but the calendar is actually not displaying. Any suggestionsp

Negative 49895 pIn a qooxdoo class, I have a set of asynchronous methods that need to be chained serializedp  precodemain function      async1 ,  async1 function      var json  new qx.data.store.Jsonhttp...     json.addListenerloaded, functionevent          ...         async2      ,  async2 function       similar to async1  codepre  pAs the number of the steps grows, the chain becomes hard to trace, and the code gets unreadable. What we can do is rewrite our code using a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsPromise relnofollowPromisesap  precodemain function      new Promisethis.async1     .thenfunction          return new Promisethis.async2     .thenfunction          return new Promisethis.async3     .catch... ,  async1 functionresolve, reject      var json  new qx.data.store.Jsonhttp...     json.addListenerloaded, functionevent          ...         resolve      ,  async2 functionresolve, reject       similar to async1  codepre  pThis works great but only until we add some real logic. Remember its a qooxdoo class with a lot of stuff encapsulated into codethiscode. But suddenly it turns out that both async methods and anonymous functions used in then and catch have their codethiscode context bound to codewindowcode, a global object. To be able to use actual codethiscode, we can perform rebindp  precodemain function      new Promisethis.async1.bindthis     .thenfunction          this.doSomeStuff         return new Promisethis.async2.bindthis     .bindthis.thenfunction          return new Promisethis.async3.bindthis     .bindthis.thenfunction          this.doSomeFinalStuff     .bindthis.catchfunction          this.doStuffOnError     .bindthis ,  async1 functionresolve, reject      this.doOtherStuff     var json  new qx.data.store.Jsonhttp...     json.addListenerloaded, functionevent          ...         resolve       codepre  pThis finally works, but doh, ugly is the code Are there any ways to get rid of those manual binds Why isnt codethiscode implicitly bound when we reference codethis.async1code, an instance method p

Negative 49895 pI am moving my build system from Grunt with custom tasks to Webpack. As for JavaScript modules it works great, but Im not so sure what to do with my Sass stylesheets.p  pI have dependencies on Sass files in my AMD modules, which Webpack can read and generate bundle.css from. But I would ideally like to have my build pipeline generate sprites using spritesmith, then copy the images to the build dir and use the Sass mixins to generate correct CSS rules.p  pI have researched this a lot both on SO and Google, but havent found anyone doing similar scenario. Should I use solely webpack Or should I maybe have separate Grunt task watching the images, generating sprites and then run Webpack over thatp

Negative 49895 pOk, this is my first time posting, I hope I can accurately explain whats going on , but heres the deal, I have a page on an iPad app Im working on that has a set of widgets they display numbered statistics on one side, and a graphical representation on the other. When I pull up this page and log the element tree, I can see the statistic side of the widgets, but not the graphical side this is good cause the graphical side isnt seen by the user yet. However, when I switch to the graphical side via an icon and log the element tree again, it still only shows the statistics side. p  pNormally, I would think that I need to better identify the graphical side, but, if I restart Instruments and quickly flip over to the graphical side, THEN log the element tree, I see the graphical side, and not the statistics side.p  pA quick visualization could be Start Instruments  Stats Side  Log Tree  Stats side  Flip to graph side  Log Tree  Stats sidep  pStart Instruments  Quickly Flip to Graph Side  Log Tree  Graph Side  Flip to stats side  Log Tree  Graph sidep  pSo, finally, I need a way to be able to access those elements whenever they appear, so is there a way to refresh the log tree, or is there a cache of the elements thats preventing me from seeing the newly visible elementsp  pThanks in advancep  pps I tagged objectivec cause thats what the app is written inp

Negative 49895 pIm having trouble managing the life cycle of my app because Im unsure exactly which events and functions pertaining to the pageapp lifecycle run when. Itd be nice if Microsoft tabulated it all somewhere. To be specific, heres what I emthinkem I know and what I dont know about the behavior of the each of the following eventsfunctionsp  pcodePage.Pagecode constructor Runs when the page is created for the first time. Unsure if it runs only once while the app is running, or each time I navigate to the page within a single session. p  pcodePage.OnNavigatedTocode Runs when the page is created and each time it is navigated to.p  pcodePage.OnNavigatedFromcode Runs when the user leaves the page. Does not run when the user presses the Start button or the lock screen button while the page is displaying.p  pcodeApp.Appcode constructor Runs only once when the app is launched.p  pcodeApp.Resumingcode Fires when the app is brought into view after being minimizedsuspended, or when the user unlocks the screen and the app comes into view. Does not run when the app is started for the first time.p  pcodeApp.Suspendingcode Fires when the user presses the back button on the home page i.e. the app is no longer in view and when the start button is pressed.p  pAnything I missed or got wrong The reason Im trying to be sure is that my app has a page which runs background audio player which in turn needs a carefully managed system of event subscriptionunsibscription, and it often behaves awkwardly if I hit the start button while on that page. And another issue is that I have a static object in my App.xaml.cs which Im using across the app and which exposes some events. Right now Im subscribingunsubscribing to the events on each page like sop  precodeprotected override void OnNavigatedToNavigationEventArgs e      App.globalObject.Event1  Event1handler   protected override void OnNavigatedFromNavigationEventArgs e      App.globalObject.Event1  Event1handler  codepre  pBut Im unsure if this is the correct approach obviously Im trying to ensure that Im only subscribed to an event once to avoid the event handler running multiple times. Should I just subscribe to the event once in the pages constructor insteadp  pEdit Im using a project template with the codeSuspensionManagercode and codeNavigationHelpercode classes included, in case that changes anything.p

Negative 49895 pHow can I tell when the process started by popen is donep  pIm passing the descriptor from fileno called on the FILE  returned by popen to a function which calls fstat and uses the value to returned to determine how much to read.  Surprisingly this actually works if there is a delay for instance, stepping through the debugger but returns a file size of zero if called immediately after the popen.  So I need some way to wait until all the output is ready  how can I do this  I assume I cant call pclose even though it does this waiting, because then the descriptor isnt valid any more.p  pUpdate Actually, it appears the code works fine if I pretend the fstat failed on the pipe call  the issue seems to be that fstat does not fail, as expected.  So what I really want is a way to tell if the descriptor is a pipe  fstat returns stmode0 was expecting SIFIFOp

The only problem is that it is hard to expire older browsepurchase data I only wanna keep, for example, a years of browsepurchase data. In this design, I will have to at some point, read the entire index out, delete the expired browsepurchase data, and write them back.p  pAnother design  is to use parentchild structure. type user is the parent of type browse and purchase. type browse will contain each browse entry. Although deleting old data seems easier with delete by query,  for the above query, I will have to do multiple andor haschild queries,and it would be much less performant. In fact, initially i was using parentchild structure, but the query time seemed really long. I thus gave it up and tried to switch to nested object.p  pI am also thinking about using nested object, but break the data into different indexlike monthly index so that I can easily expire old data. The problem with this approach is that I have to query across those multiple indexes, and do aggregation on that to get the distinct users, which I assume will be much slower.havnt tried yet. One requirement of this project is to be able to give the count of the queries in acceptable time frame.like seconds and I am afraid this approach may not be acceptable.p  pThe ES cluster is 7 machines, each 8 cores and 32G memory.

Negative 49895 pI have a Java service which creates x games in the future every y seconds calculating start time and end time for each of them and inserts them into a DB2 table. The code basically looks for the end time of the last created game, if it exists and is not in the past, and uses it to create future games. Otherwise, it uses the game duration same for all games and the current time to create the new games.p  pThis service will run on several machines at once, so there is a risk that the check for the last game is not accurate. One solution would be to lock the whole table, but this doesnt scale well. Any ideas of more efficient handling of this casep

Note not SVGs included in html pages, but pages in SVG format to be directly referenced by links. p  pThe extension itself was not an issue, the javascript code is included inside the SVG markup.

Negative 49895 pIm pretty much a novice when it comes to JavaScript and jQuery so bare with me if I make some obvious mistakes.p  pIm currently trying to make an image gallery that will show lots of art. Therefore the website will have lots of images. I noticed that when I viewed my code on another computer the images would take time to load. While on my computer they would display straight away and I guessing this is due to them already being cached.p  pSo I did some looking around to see if I could prevent this and I found lots of  people mentioning preloading images. However, I couldnt really find a solution that fits my desire or a explanation I could understandI hate using code I dont understand. So I tried to have a go myself and it didnt work out, but I felt the logic I what I writing was right but needs tweaking Im going to write my code below and any advice on what need to do next would be greatly appreciated.p  pPreloading images codep  precodevar allImages  img.attrsrc select every image var preloadImages  []  add images to empty array forvar i  0 i lt allImages.length i     preloadImages.pushallImages[i]   then preload images forvar i  0 i lt preloadImages.length i     new Image.src  preloadImages[i]  codepre  pSo that is the code I wrote to preload images on my page. Let me know where Im going wrong. Im really not sure how I go about selecting all images on my website and loading them into an array I can then cycle overp  pThanks for the responses I guess I didnt explain my problem that well. A lot of the solutions to preloading images seem to be manually typing in every image src into and array. What I was looking for was a way to select every image I have and then put them into an array without actually typing them in. Is that possible My reason for that is when I keep adding more and more images it would be great if the preloading could just take care of itself.p

Negative 49895 pIve read through earlier posts and have not seen what I need help on.p  pI am not a developer  but am working through dev items as on an as needed basis. I have managed to put together a web scraper that posts to a webhook that is picked up and appended to a table I have in my Google Cloud SQL.p  pThe scraper Im using is posting all of the data I am scraping in JSON format to a single text cell. I need to create an automated script that will take this data and parse it back into the specific JSON pairs and then read this data back into a different table. p  pThe text blob has n number of sets of data, with each set made up of a fixed number of JSON pairs. After parsing, I will need n rows of data, each with a column of data representing the value from the JSON pair. p  pIm assuming that I can do this with a Php script  read the data, parse and then write the data. p  pWhere would this script live Is there a way of triggering it so that each time a new batch of data is fed into the mySQL table it runs, parses and append the new data into the second table or schema I only have Cloud SQL at the moment. What other Google services do I need to enable this process once writtenp

Negative 49895 pIm new to the Ionic framework and was trying to follow through the a hrefhttpionicframework.comdocsguidestarting.html relnofollowIonic ToDo app demonstrationa. Before starting I want to mention I manually installed the latest ionic release from its GitHub page and included the following in my codeindex.htmlcode codeionic.bundle.jscode, codeangular.min.jscode, codeangularanimate.min.jscode, codeangularresource.min.jscode, codeangularsanitize.min.jscode, codeangularuirouter.min.jscode.  In chapter 5, the author details the controller code to create a new task. I tried adding some extra functionality to the code.createTaskcodemethod defined asp  precodescope.createTask  functiontask  scope.tasks.push   title task.title  scope.taskModal.hide task.title    codepre  pby changing it top  precodescope.createTask  functiontask    if task.title          window.alertEmpty Task       scope.taskModal.hide     else        scope.tasks.pushtitle task.title       scope.taskModal.hide       task.title        codepre  pNow, if you run this new code with the accompanying view outlined in the tutorial, you will see that the controller calls the empty task alert even if codetask.title  code fails Maybe Im missing something really obvious, but Im not sure. Furthermore, and the main reason Im writing this post, if you simply comment out the line codetask.title  code in the codeelsecode clause and add a task via the live view, it adds two instances of the task created This is bizarre, or so I thought, as it seems like codescope.tasks.pushtitle task.titlecode is being executed twice. So just like any good programmer would do, I tried to make the compiler in this case interpreter spill its secrets. I declared a variable in the controller scope, codescope.i  0code, to keep track of what was happening. Leaving codetask.title  code in its place, I insertedp  precodescope.i  1 window.alertscope.i codepre  pright before it. When you run this code, you will notice two thingsp  ol liThe controller no longer calls the empty task alert on nonempty tasks.li liThe view is now updated with only one instance of the created task.li ol  pSo, Im not really sure whats happening. Maybe its just some careless error Ive overlooked, but any help on this will be really appreciated. Many thanksp  hr   pstrongEDITstrongp  pI tried experimenting further and it seems the whole thing hinges on codewindow.alertcode. Even ifp  precodescope.i  1 window.alertscope.i codepre  pis replaced withp  precodewindow.alert1 codepre  pthe solution still works. Although if you use codewindow.alertcode or codewindow.alertcode the original problem remains.p

Negative 49895 pIm making an OAuth2 call from my ASP.NET MVC web application to my Web API through JavaScript to authenticate my user and get a token.  The Web API accesses a SQL Server database where the users login is stored using Identity and the typical AspNetUsers tables.  My API call returns a 20 min access token and a 2 week refresh token.  The API and consuming apps are products that we are developing that our customers will register with.  In other words, all the code is on our side.p  pI know I must refresh the access token before it expires by passing the API the refresh token.  My question is...where do I store the access and refresh tokens on the client for use in my JavaScript to make subsequent API calls or to refresh the token  People online are saying that storing anything clientside is bad, cookies are unsecure, etc and without offering any solutions.  Local storage  But of course these are Ajax calls in JavaScript that we are making to the API, so the tokens needs to exist somewhere on the client side  Its driving me crazy trying to figure this out.  I know I need to at least use HTTPS.p
