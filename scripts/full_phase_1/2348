Positive 2348 pEDIT adding that this problem seems to be strictly related to making these calls from within an RPC process to the title.  I thought I was going to be required to use RPC to do what I was doing but was mistaken.br After pulling my code out of that process and running from the server it works as expected.  I have decided to leave the question rather than delete it in case anyone else might find the comments of use.p  pJust as the title suggests, CalledProcessError is not triggering my except block when a subprocess checkcall fails.p  pMy code is fairly straight forward, I have a UNC path that I want to mount to a local directory.  if it does not exist, we create it and mount it.  we then push exportfile to a subdirectory on the mounted share that we create if needed.  If any of these operations fail we want to log it and fail out.  Finally, we unmount the share.p  pI attempted making one call using ampamp separators but this only seemed to convolute things when things went wrong.  After separating all the operations into their own calls using subprocess.checkcall I am getting the results I want for known good situations, the problem is that I want to reuse this code as a test for mountability by setting exportfileNonep  pThe code is as followsp  precodedef exportbackuplocaldir, remotedir, creds, exportfileNone          process for testing UNC path mountability and for exporting file to UNC path     param localdir path for local dir to be used as mount point     param remotedir UNC for remote path to mount to local dir     param creds dictionary with keys username, domain, and password set value to None if nonexistent     param exportfile path to file for exporting, set to None to simply test mountability of remotedir          try          in case we failed to unmount for whatever reason         if os.path.ismountlocaldir              unmount existing mount             subprocess.checkcall[sudo, umount, l, localdir]         elif not os.path.isdirlocaldir              create new directory             subprocess.checkcall[sudo, mkdir, localdir]          mount path         cmd  [sudo, mount, t, cifs]          build creds         credstring  ,.join[01.formatkey, value for key, value in creds.items if value]         if credstring             cmd.extend[o, credstring]         cmd.extend[remotedir, localdir]         subprocess.checkcallcmd         if exportfile             exportdir  os.path.joinlocaldir, 0applexport.formatgethostname             newfilename  os.path.joinexportdir, os.path.basenameexportfile             if not os.path.isdirexportdir                  create subdirectory                 subprocess.checkcall[sudo, mkdir, exportdir]              export file             subprocess.checkcall[sudo, cp, exportfile, newfilename]     except Exception as ex         logger.exceptionuappliance.rpc.exportbackup.error, causeex         raise ex     finally          unmount         subprocess.checkcall[sudo, umount, l, localdir] codepre  pI can make my own checks for if operations have actually succeeded or failed by making calls likep  precodeif not os.path.ismountlocaldir     raise ExceptionFailed to mount codepre  pAfter running my subprocess commands... and this works, but this seems broken and backwards.p  pFrom everything that I have read and even tested in python shells, checkcall should raise a CalledProcessError if something exits with a nonzero return code, but for some reason I cannot understand they are not triggering for me here.p  pan example of a bad call I have tried would bep  precodesubprocess.checkcall[sudo, mount, t, cifs, o, usernamesomethingbad,passwordsomethingwrong,domainthisisrightforsomereason, destinationdoesntexist, mntexport] codepre  pfrom the shell this tells me could not resolve address for destination Unknown error and then feeds me the CalledProcessError traceback.

Positive 2348 pIm writing a Java library, actually, a Clojure library, but for this question, what matters is that it runs on the JVM. This library needs to execute some JavaScript. a hrefhttpscarouselapps.com20150911isomorphicclojurescriptjavascriptforprerenderingsinglepageapplicationspart1I tried with Nashorna but I encounter some limitations that might be too hard to overcome. As an alternative, I want to try NodeJS.p  pI want my library to be self contained, to not depend on the system running NodeJS independently and thus requiring a particular deployment mechanism to place the Java and NodeJS artifacts in the right places to be picked up by the two different network servers. This approach, though, brings some issues.p  pI will be talking to NodeJS over HTTP but I dont want NodeJS to open a specific port. I want to find a random unused one so theres no collisions. I also want to control where the logs from NodeJS go, as to keep them with the rest of my application. Lastly, my app should be able to detect when NodeJS crashed and rerun it or report an error with information.p  pWhats the best way to approach this Are there any Java libraries to help manage child process in this fashion Anything in particular I should do from the NodeJS side Im very new to NodeJS, I never used it before.p

Positive 2348 pI frequently need to sort a collection of files that contain headers.

Positive 2348 pThe architecture of the program consists of a PySide GUI executable build with Py2exe. Furthermore it has a second python console application build with Py2exe. p  pThe GUIApp starts the console application using a named Pipe to be able to send CTRLC and capture stdoutstderr. This is done using the pywin32 module.p  pInside the console application several other Windows applications are executed in blocking mode using the subprocess module. Now the console application got extended by some code to execute another program in nonblocking mode. p  pIf the GUI application and the Console application are executed Before being build to a Py2exe App everything works as expected and wanted. If the applications are build with Py2exe the external Windows application freezes and a windows error pops up. application stopped workingp  pIf the execution code of the external Windows app is isolated and a py2exe  executable build, everything works.p  pSo the problem must be py2exe and calling the console app from a GUI app.p  pI hope someone can point me in the right direction.p  pI got asked for a minimal example. The problem is that the architecture does not really allow a minimal working example. I tried my best and i hope the given Example draws a clearer image of the problem.

Positive 2348 pIm working on a tool for data entry at my job where it basically takes a report ID number, opens a PDF to that page of that report, allows you to input the information and then saves it.p  pIm completely new to instantiating new processes in python this is the first time that Ive really tried to do it. so basically, I have a relevant functionp  precodedef getreportid     path  reportpathid     if not path         raise NameError     page  getpagepath, id     proc  subprocess.Popen[CProgram Files x86AdobeReader 11.0ReaderAcroRd32.exe, A, page.formatpage,                              path] codepre  pin order to open the report in Adobe Acrobat and be able to input information while the report is still open, I determined that I had to use codemultiprocessingcode. So, as a result, in the main loop of the program, where it iterates through data and gets the report ID, I have thisp  precodefor row in rows     print Opening report for .formatID     arg  ID     proc  Processtargetgetreport, argsarg,     proc.start      row[1]  rawinputEnter the desired value      rows.updateRowrow      while proc.isalive         pass codepre  pThis way, one can enter data without the program hanging on the codesubprocess.Popencode command. However, if it simply continues on to the next record without closing the Acrobat window that pops up, then it wont actually open the next report. Hence the codewhile proc.isalivecode, as it gives one a chance to close the window manually. Id emlikeem to kill the process immediately after enter is hit and the value entered, so it will go on and just open the next report with even less work. I tried several different things, ways to kill processes through the codepidcode using codeos.killcode I tried killing the subprocess, killing the process itself, killing both of them, and also tried using codesubprocess.callcode instead of codePopencode to see if it made a difference. p  pIt didnt.p  pWhat am I missing here How do I kill the process emandem close the window that it opened in Is this even possible Like I said, I have just about 0 experience with processes in python.

Negative 2348 pYay, first post on SO Good work Jeff et al.p  pWere trying to solve a bottleneck in one of our webapplications that was introduced when we started allowing users to generate reports ondemand.p  pOur infrastructure is as follows 1 server acting as a WebserverDBServer ColdFusion 7 and MSSQL 2005p  pIts serving a webapplication for our backend users and a frontend website.  The reports are generated by the users from the backend so theres a level of security where the users have to log in web based.p  pDuring peak hours when reports are generated it brings the webapplication and frontend website to unacceptable speed due to SQL Server using resources for the huge queries and afterward ColdFusion generating multi page PDFs.p  pWere not exactly sure what the best practice would be to remove some load, but restricting access to the reports isnt an option at the moment. p  pWeve considered denormalizing data to other tables to simplify the most common queries, but that seems like it would just push the issue further.p  pSo, were thinking of getting a second server and use it as a report server with a replicated copy of our DB on which the queries would be ran.  This would fix one issue, but the second remains generating PDFs is resource intensive. p  pWe would like to offload that task to the reporting server as well, but being in a secured webapplication we cant just fire HTTP GET to create PDFs with the user logged in the webapplication from server 1 and displaying it in the webapplication but generatingfetching it on server 2 without validating the users credential...p  pAnyone have experience with this Thanks in advance Stack Overflowp

Negative 2348 pI have a simple application in which I need to let the user select a shader .fx HLSL or assembly file, possibly with multiple passes, but all and only pixel shader and preview it.p  pThe application runs, the list of shaders comes up, and a button launches the preview window. From this preview window which has a DirectX viewport in it, the user selects an image and the shader is run on that image and displayed. Only one frame needs rendered not realtime.p  pI have a vertexpixel shader combination set up that takes a quad and renders it to the screen, textured with the chosen image. This works perfectly. I need to then run another effect, purely pixel shader, on the output from the first effect, and display the final image postprocessed to the screen. This doesnt work at all.p  pIve tried for the past few days to get it working, but for no apparent reason, the identical code blocks used to render each effect only render the first. I can add the second shader file as a second pass in the first shader file and it runs perfectly although completely defeats my goal of previewing usercreated shaders. When I try to use a second effect which loads and compiles just fine, it does nothing. Ive taken the results of the first shader with GetRenderTargetData and placed them in a texture amp surface destTex and destSur, then set that texture as the input for the second pass using devSetTexture and later effectSetTexturethisframe, destTex.p  pAll calls succeed, effects compile, textures load, quads are drawn, but the effect is not visible. I suspected at first the device created with software vertex processing was causing the issue, but that doesnt seem to be the case I tried with hardware and mixed. Additionally, using both a HAL and REF device not a problem, since the app isnt realtime anyways, that second shader isnt visible. Everything is written in C for Direct3D 9.p

Negative 2348 pI faced this problem and after an extensive research I found its root cause and a workaround that can be useful for other people.p  pThe icon decorator becomes blurred because its positioning on the shape and the conversion from pixels to inches.p  pUsually the drawing surface of the Domain Specific Language has a resolution of 96dpi and the Icon Decorators are positioned using an offset of 0.06 inches. Translating it to pixels it becomes an offset of 5.76 pixels in the drawing surface. As it is not possible to draw a half pixel on the screen the GDI adjusts the image in an attempt to emulate the haf pixel positioning. That is the reason why the image becomes blurred.p  pMy suggestion as workaround, is to use the Horizontal Offset and the Vertical Offset properties of the Icon decorator class for fixing the half pixel decorator position. If you use the 0.0025 inches as vertical and horizontal offsets, when the image positioning is translated from inches to pixels it becomes 6 pixels, instead of 5.76. It happens because the offset now is the default value 0.06 inches plus the offset you set 0.0025  0.0625.p  pI also found that using png images with transparency causes the image blurring, even using the offset workaround I suggested here. Converting the image to bitmap format fixes the problem.p  pIf someone also has any suggestions for fixing the problem, please add your solution or workaround.p

Negative 2348 pI am working on an MVVMbased WPF app that uses the codeDataGridcode. The grid is databound to an codeObservableCollectionltWidgetgtcode the codeWidgetcode list. The user needs to be able to insert a codeWidgetcode into the list below the currentlyselected codeWidgetcode, to delete a selected codeWidgetcode, and to reorder the codeWidgetcodes on the grid. Ill implement the reordering through dragging and dropping.p  pBefore I dig into this, I want to get a reality check on my approach. Here is what I am planning to do The codeWidgetcode class will have an codeIndexcode property that will be used to order the codeWidgetcode list. Additions, deletions, and reordering will be done by manipulating this Index property, and sorting will be done on the codeWidgetcode list, rather than through a codeCollectionViewcode.p  pBefore the codeDataContextcode is set, the codeWidgetcode list will be sorted on the codeIndexcode property. When a user adds a codeWidgetcode, the codeIndexcode property will be incremented by 1 for each codeWidgetcode below the selected item on the grid, and the new codeWidgetcode will be given the index number opened up by the renumbering. The codeWidgetcode list will resorted, and the bindings will be refreshed.p  pWhen a user deletes a codeWidgetcode, the codeWidgetcode will be removed from the list, and the codeIndexcode property of items on the grid below the deleted item will be decremented by 1. The codeWidgetcode list will be resorted, and the bindings refreshed, as above. Reordering will be done as a combination deleteandinsert.p  pHere is my question Is this a reasonable strategy for implementing inserting, deleting, and reordering Is there a better way to go about it Any good articles or blog posts on the subject Ive looked, but Im not coming up with anything onpoint.p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 2348 pI am writing a program in VB.Net to manage text messages sent through an API. It allows you to view messages in a datagridview and filter by date, sentunsent etc...p  pTo load the messages Im executing an SQL statement and retrieving a DataTable which then gets set as the DataSource for my DataGridView control.p  pThe problem is that depending on the filters selected the user could be selecting a lot of records and it would take some time for the DataSource to update. I want to inform the user of this load time by providing a progress bar or label of some kind.p  pI have used progress bars before when looping through data but this is loading it all at once. I thought of displaying a label when the user clicks to load the data and then hiding it when the data is loaded. But this happens instantaneously even when the data is still loading.p  pIs there an event on the DataGridView I can use perhaps Something like .DataSourceLoadStart and .DataSourceLoadFinished.p  pI know Im just making those events up... but hopefully it makes it clearer as to what I want.p

Negative 2348 pI have a situation in my application. For each xaxis point in my chart, I am plotting 5 yaxis values. To calculate each of these 5 values, I need to make 4 different queries. Ie, for each xaxis point I need to fire 20 sql queries. p  pNow, I need to plot 40 such points in the my chart. Its resulting in a pathetic performance where it takes close to a minute to get all the data back from the database. Each of 4 different queries consists of a join between 2 tables. One has only 6 rows. The other close to 10,000. Each of the 4 queries has different WHERE clauses, so they are different queries. For each point in the xaxis, only the values for the where clauses change. p  pI have tried combining each of the 4 queries into one big string. Basically batch the four selects. These are again batched for each yaxis value. strongSo, for each xaxis point, I am now firing one big command that consists of 20 different select statements.strong p  pTechnically, I should be experiencing a big performance boost, right Instead of hitting the db 40x5x4  800 times, I am now hitting it just 40 times. But instead of taking 60 seconds, it taking 5055 seconds... not much of a help.p  pI am using MySql 5.1, and the 6.1 version of its .Net connector. p  pWhat can I do to improve the performancep  pEditp  pOne of the 4 queries is as followsp  precodeSELECT   SUMTIMETOSECTIMEDIFFT1.col2, T1.col1 T2.col1  3600 1000 AS TotalTime FROM Table T1   JOIN Table T2    ON T1.col3  T2.col3 WHERE T1.col4  i     AND T1.col1 gt 20091225 000000     AND T1.col2 lt 20091226 000000 codepre  pThe other 3 queries are similar, only the where clause changes slightly. This set of 4 queries is fired 5 times. The first 3 times against the join of  table T1 and T2, passing in different values for col4. And the next two times against the join of table T3 and T2 passing in different values for col4. These 5 values are the yaxis values for a particular xaxis point.p  pThe data returned by all these queries is the same format. so, we tried doing a UNION ALL on all these queries. No substantial difference. One strange thing, however, after indexing the foreign key on the table T1 [while it contained over a lakh records], the queries were using the index, but they had become slower. At times, the queries would take double the time to return the data. p

Negative 2348 pI have an NSDocumentbased Cocoa app and I have a couple of secondary threads that I need to terminate gracefully wait for them to run through the current loop when the users closes the document window or when the application quits. Im using canCloseDocumentWithDelegate to send a flag to the threads when the document is closing and then when theyre done, one of them calls [NSDocument close]. This seems to work peachy keen when the user closes the document window, but when you quit the app, it goes all kinds of wrong crashes before it calls anything. What is the correct procedure for something like this p

Negative 2348 pSay you have a typical gameloop, running about 30 times a second. One particular function takes about 50 of the time and looks like a prime candidate for parallelization  say its a big loop or there are 4 distinct and independent strands of work going on. Assume we already checked that the function itself can parallelize well emin isolationem to 2 4 cores.p  pIs OpenMP likely to give a speed up in such a case Id expect that naively creating 13 threads each frame to split the work would not be great, but I dont really know what overhead a thread creationdestruction brings, if its 10ms or 100. And i dont know if OMP is efficient at this kind of thing, or is only really suited to longer running pieces of code.p  pThoughtsp
Negative 2348 pI have a simple class library COM service written in C to consume 5 web services Add, Minus, Divide, Multiply and Compare.p  pIve created the abstract product and abstract factory classes. The abstract product named WSs code  p  precodepublic abstract class WS       public abstract double Calculatedouble a, double b      public abstract string Comparedouble a, double b    codepre  pAs you see, when one of the subclasses inherits WS, both methods must be overridden which might not be useful in some subclasses. E.g. iComparei doesnt need Calculate method.  p  pTo instantiate a new CompareWS object, the client class will call the CreateWS method which returns a WS object type.p  precodepublic class CompareWSFactory  WSFactory      public override WS CreateWS              return new CompareWS       codepre  pBut if Compare is not defined in WS, the Compare method cannot be invoked. Its because the client will make use of WS type object, not CompareWS object.p  pThis is only an example with two methods, but what if there are more methods Is it stupid to define all the methods as abstract in the WS classp  pMy question is I want to define abstract methods that are common to all subclasses of WS whereas when the factory creates a WS object type, all the methods of the subclasses can be invoked overridden methods of WS and also the methods in subclasses. How should I do thisp

Negative 2348 pIve got a bit of a problem.p  pI have a Kohana application that has dynamically added fields.p  pThe fields that are added are called DISA numbers.p  pIn the model I look these up and the result is returned as an array. I encode the array into a JSON string and use JQuery to populate them The View knows the length of the array and so creates as many DISA elements as required before display.  See the code below for a summary of how that works.p  pWhat Im finding is that this is starting to get difficult to manage.  The code is becoming messy.  Error handling of this type of dynamic content is ending up being spread all over the place.  Not only that, it doesnt work how I want. What you see here is just a small snippet of code.p  pFor error handling I am using the validation library.  I started by using addrules on all the fields that come back in the post. As they are always phone numbers I set a required rule when its there and a digit rule on the validationasarray keys.  That works. The difficulty is actually giving it back to the view. i.e. dynamically added javascript field.  Submits back to form.  Save contents into a session.  View has to load up fields from database  those from the previous post and signal the fields that have problems.  Its all quite messy and Im getting this code spread through both the view the controller and the model.p  pSo my question is.  Have you done this before in Kohana and how have you handled it There must be an easier way rightp  pCode snippet.p  p edit.php p  precodepublic function phoneid    ...      thisgttemplategtcontentgtdisanumbers               phonesgtfetchdisanumbersthisgtaccount, id    ...  codepre  p phones.php p  precodepublic function fetchdisanumbersaccount, id      query  thisgtdbgtquerySELECT id, cidin FROM disa WHERE ownerext, arrayid      if query         return            return query  codepre  p editphones.php p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var disaId  1  function delDisaNumberelement      Put X on the front of the element name to mark this for deletion      element.prev.attrname, Xelement.prev.attrname     element.parent.hide   function addDisaNumber      input name is prepended with N which means new      disanumbers.appendltligtltinput nameNdisadisaId iddisa      typetextgtlta classhide onClickdelDisaNumberthisgtltagtltligt     disaId  ltscriptgt  ...   ltphp      echo formopeneditsaveDisaNumbers.phone, arrayclassgtsection, idgtdisaform     echo formopenfieldsetarrayclassgtbalancedgrid gt       ltul classfields iddisanumbersgt       ltphp         disaId  1         foreach  disanumbers as disanumber              echo ltligt             echo forminputdisa.disaId, disanumbergtcidin             echolta classhide onclickdelDisaNumberthisgtltagt             echo ltligt             disaId                gt        ltulgt       ltbutton typebuttononclickaddDisaNumbergtlta classaddgtltagtAdd numberltbuttongt        ltphp         echo formsubmitsubmit, Save         echo formclose       gt codepre  pEDITIve found an inline form validation plugin that is ideal for this.

Negative 2348 pI apologize in advance but this will be a long question.p  pIm stuck.  I am trying to learn unit testing, C, and design patterns  all at once.  Maybe thats my problem.  As such I am reading the Art of Unit Testing Osherove, and Clean Code Martin, and Head First Design Patterns OReilly.  p  pI am just now beginning to understand delegates and events which you would see if you were to troll my SO questions of recent.  I still dont quite get lambdas.  p  pTo contextualize all of this I have given myself a learning project I am calling goAlarms.  I have an Alarm class with members youd expect NextAlarmTime, Name, AlarmGroup, Event Trigger etc.p  pI wanted the Timer of the alarm to be extensible so I created an IAlarmScheduler interface as follows...  p  precodepublic interface AlarmScheduler      Dictionaryltstring,Alarmgt AlarmList  get      void Startup     void Shutdown     void AddTriggerstring triggerName, string groupName, Alarm alarm     void RemoveTriggerstring triggerName     void PauseTriggerstring triggerName     void ResumeTriggerstring triggerName     void PauseTriggerGroupstring groupName     void ResumeTriggerGroupstring groupName     void SetSnoozeTriggerstring triggerName, int duration     void SetNextOccurrence string triggerName, DateTime nextOccurrence  codepre  pThis IAlarmScheduler interface define a component that will RAISE an alarm Trigger which will bubble up to my Alarm class and raise the Trigger Event of the alarm itself.  It is essentially the Timer component.  p  pI have found that the Quartz.net component is perfectly suited for this so I have created a QuartzAlarmScheduler class which implements IAlarmScheduler.p  pAll that is fine.  My problem is that the Alarm class is abstract and I want to create a lot of different KINDS of alarm.  For example, I already have a Heartbeat alarm triggered every int interval of minutes, AppointmentAlarm triggered on set date and time, Daily Alarm triggered every day at X and perhaps others.  p  pAnd Quartz.NET is perfectly suited to handle this.  p  pMy problem is a design problem.  I want to be able to instantiate an alarm of any kind without my Alarm class or any derived classes knowing anything about Quartz.  The problem is that Quartz has awesome factories that return just the right setup for the Triggers that will be needed by my Alarm classes.  So, for example, I can get a Quartz trigger by using TriggerUtils.MakeMinutelyTrigger to create a trigger for the heartbeat alarm described above. Or TriggerUtils.MakeDailyTrigger for the daily alarm.  p  pI guess I could sum it up this way.  Indirectly or directly I want my alarm classes to be able to consume the TriggerUtils.Make classes without knowing anything about them.  I know that is a contradiction, but that is why I am asking the question.  p  pI thought about putting a delegate field into the alarm which would be assigned one of these Make method but by doing that I am creating a hard dependency between alarm and Quartz which I want to avoid for both unit testing purposes and design purposes.  I thought of using a switch for the type in QuartzAlarmScheduler per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1711005whydoesntcswitchstatementallowusingtypeofgettypeherea but I know it is bad design and I am trying to learn good design.p  pYou guys are awesome and thanks in advance for your answers.  p  pSethp

Negative 2348 pI have some configuration stored in the servlet context, sharing among servlets. The current approach is to load the config into a single copy of static hashmap shared by the servlets when the init method of any servlet is called.

Because the servlet never call init again, they will not reload the configuration into the hashmap. p  pI am using websphere 7, is there any place I can configure when does a servlet die, and a new servlet is bornp  pI think it is too clumsy to reload the configuration from the servlet context when there is a new request.p  hr  pEdit I have a scheduler which will create a new thread to check for a specific data file, if the data file was new, it will create a hashmapwith content of the data file as an attribute in the servlet context.p  pNow the servlets will check for the servlet context for the hashmap and copy it to a static hashmap for shared use among servlets when they are just created and call init.

Negative 2348 pIm working on an API wrapper class, which is the first Ive made. For the most part it hasnt been too difficult. Getting to the point where I need to deal with the potential of errors being returned by the API, however confused as to how I should go about dealing with them.p  pAn external file will make a call to the API class, ie, codefindVenueByLocationIDlocationIDcode This function will then construct the URL and method of API call POST, GET, DELETE, etc and pass that to a function called makeCall.p  pMakeCall constructs the completed URL, sends the request to the service and passes back the resulting XML. If the API returns an error, it is within the XML it returns. The URL is called using the function filegetcontents. The API has a set number of error codes it will return in the XML.p  pAs I understand it, I should do the following during the function makeCall p  ul liBefore the XML is returned, check to see if it contains an error code, and if so, pass that to an error handling class to deal with the error. Log and return client version error messageli liadd a try catch around the filegetcontents function to catch any connection errors, ie not being able to access the serverli ul  pIs that considered the best way to do things Should I be adding a try catch around the call to makeCall rather than inside it round filegetcontents Should I be throwing an exception for each error returned by the XML and handling them with an error classp  pThe sort of answer Im looking for should also contain a link to a resource explaining some best practices surrounding error handling with API wrappers or such things.p  pThanks in advance for your time and responses.p  hr  pEDIT After talking with our CTO, errors in PHP at current version ARE exceptions, and I should throw exceptions and leave the dealing of the exceptions to the caller. Remember, Im implementing a wrapper class for an API. Thoughtsp

The RIA Services code generator generates the right data annotations in the client code, so its picking it up correctly.p
Negative 2348 pI have been asked to create a graphical programming IDE for embedded 8bit and 32bit microcontrollers.  It needs to be as easy as using LabVIEW, but I dont need features like debugging or simulating at least for now.  Basically the application needs to allow the user to configure logic gates, whilefor loops, case statements, comparisons, flow control, etc.  Once the program is finished it should generate the C code, compile and write the program on the connected microcontroller.  Right now were are targeting Atmel and Freescale processors and will be using DIO, analog IO for current sensing, CAN bus, PWM, and probably some more that Im missing.p  pI realize that this is a HUGE undertaking that will take a very long time to develop, but its software that my company wants to provide customers when they buy our hardware.  To back up a bit and give you a little background information, our company builds IO modules that work on CAN bus or standalone.  Today, the only way to program the microcontoller on our PCB is to use the IDE from Atmel AVR Studio or Freescale CodeWarrior.  The problem is that the customer does not always have the knowhow to program in C.  So... enter the graphical IDE.  LabVIEW is too expensive for the customer, so were stuck with creating our own.p  pSo my question is what is a good way to create this IDE  I am planning on developing this in CWPF, but Im wondering how hard it will be to convert the logic that the user created into C code that can be compiled by the AtmelFreescale compiler.  Or perhaps there is a better method out there  Has anyone done anything like thisp

Negative 2348 pstrongtldrstrongbr Im getting better performance with my erlang program when I perform my CPU intensive tasks at higher concurrency e.g. 10K at once vs. 4. Whyp  hr   pIm writing a map reduce framework using erlang, and Im doing performance tests.  p  pMy map function is highly CPU intensive mostly pure calculation. It also needs access to some static data, so I have a few persistent lingering i.e. lives through the app. life cycle worker processes on my machine, each having a part of this data inmemory, and awaiting map requests. The output of map is sent to the manager process which sent out the map requests to the workers, where the reduce very lightweight is performed.  p  pAnyways, I noticed that Im getting better throughput when I immediately spawn a new process for each map request that the workers receives, rather than letting the worker process itself synchronously perform the map request by itself onebyone thus leaving bunch of map requests in its process queue, because Im firing the map requests all at once.  p  pCode snippet  p  precode When I remove the comment, I get significant performance boost 90 gt 96  spawnlinkfungt                  One invocation uses around 250ms of CPU time                 domapMap, AssignedSet, Emit, Data,                 Manager  finished, JobId, self, AssignedSet, normal,        end, codepre  pCompared to when I perform the same calculation in a tight loop, I get 96 throughput efficiency using the immediately spawning method e.g. 10000 map reduce jobs running completely in parallel. When I use the worker performs onebyone method, I get only around 90.  p  pI understand Erlang is supposed to be good at concurrent stuff, and Im impressed that efficiency doesnt change even if I perform 10K map reduce requests at once as opposed to 100 etc However, since I have only 4 CPU cores, Id expect to get better throughput if I use lower concurrency like 4 or maybe 5.  p  pWeirdly, my CPU usage looks very similar in the 2 different implementation almost completely pegged at 100 on all cores. The performance difference is quite stable. I.e. even when I just do 100 map reduce jobs, I still get around 96 efficiency with the immediately spawn method, and around 90 when I use onebyone method. Likewise when I test with 200, 500, 1000, 10K jobs.  p  pI first suspected that the queuing at the worker process queue is the culprit, but even when I should only have something like 25 messages in the worker process queue, I still see the lower performance. 25 messages seem to be quite small for causing a clog I am doing selective message matching, but not in a way the process would have to put messages back to the queue.  p  pIm not sure how I should proceed from here. Am I doing something wrong, or am I completely missing something p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  p  pI did some more tests and found out that the performance difference can disappear depending on conditions particularly into how many worker process I divide the static data. Looks like I have much more to learnp

Negative 2348 pIn their talk a hrefhttpwww.cs.princeton.edurstalksQuicksortIsOptimal.pdf relnofollowQuicksort is Optimala, Sedgewick and Bentley refer to a modified version of the quicksort partitioning step called BentleyMcIlroy threeway partitioning.  This version of the partition step adapts gracefully to inputs containing equal keys by always pulling out copies of the pivot element from what remains, ensuring that when invoked on arrays containing duplicates the algorithm still performs well.p  pThe C code for this partitioning step is reprinted herep  precodevoid threeWayPartitionItem a[], int l, int r     int i  l1, j  r, p  l1, q  r Item v  a[r]   if r lt l return   for               while a[i] lt v         while v lt a[j] if j  l break        if i gt j break        excha[i], a[j]        if a[i]  v  p excha[p], a[i]         if v  a[j]  q excha[j], a[q]          excha[i], a[r] j  i1 i  i1   for k  l k lt p k, j excha[k], a[j]   for k  r1 k gt q k, i excha[i], a[k]  codepre  pI am interested in implementing this version of quicksort as an STL algorithm just for my own edification, not as a replacement for the very fast codestdsortcode.  In order to do this, I would ideally accept as input to the algorithm a range of STL iterators defining the range to be sorted.  Because quicksort does not require random access, I would hope that these iterators would be bidirectional iterators, since this would make the algorithm more general and would allow me to sort codestdlistcodes and other containers only supporting bidirectional access.p  pHowever, theres a slight problem with this.  Notice that the very first line of the threeway partitioning algorithm contains thisp  precodeint i  l1, p  l1 codepre  pThis ends up creating two integers that are before the range to be partitioned, which is fine because in the body of the loop theyre incremented before theyre used.  However, if I replace these indices with bidirectional iterators, this code no longer has defined behavior because it backs an iterator up before the start of the range to sort.p  pMy question is as follows  strongwithout substantially rewriting the core of the algorithmstrong, is there a way to adapt this code to use STLstyle iterators given that the algorithm begins by backing up an iterator at the start of a range  Right now, the only thoughts Ive had would be introducing extra variables to pretend that we backed up the iterator on the first step, or decorating the iterators with special iterator adapters that allow you to back up before the beginning by just tracking how many logical steps you are before the start of the range.  Neither of these seems very elegant... am I missing something  Is there a straightforward solutionp  pThanksp

Negative 2348 pI am working on creating a C P2P chat messenger without a central server. And I need help on how i should start implementing the model.p  pI have in mind to send out a UDP broadcast to all the computers on the network. Then the receiving computer would receive it, and add that new peer to a hashtable. Then using a TCP server embed in each program. The messages would be broadcast in TCP to all computers listed in the hashtable. And the other peer would receive it and then send out their own message. Is this a viable way of creating a peer2peer chat application, or is there a better way to do itp

Negative 2348 pI love the old school editors because they enable users to absolutely emflyem through their code, editing almost as fast as they can think.p  pHowever, they suck balls at awareness of their environment, lacking robust implementations of features like Intellisense preemptive strike no, there really isnt an intellisense implementation in emacs that is trivial to install and doesnt suck and common refactorings preemptive strike 2 global search and replace does not a refactoring tool make. i.e. It would be nice to be able to use nothing but vim to develop in .Net, but at the moment it is an illconceived undertaking at best.p  pI love Visual StudioEclipseXCode because they are so integrated with their environments that I almost never need to look up API documentation, and can refactor fearlessly.p  pHowever, they suck balls at basic text manipulation and macros relative to viemacs, are not available on all platforms with exception of Eclipse, are likely either going to change nontrivially or perhaps just not be around in the next 1020 years, and most importantly, are unable to run tetris.p  pWill we ever see the day when emacs or vi will be able to be as tightly integrated with .Net, Java and ObjectiveC projects as Visual Studio, Eclipse and XCodep  pIf not, is it because of proprietary concerns i.e. would require emacs to ship with a copy of the .Net framework Or is it just because at the moment our team doesnt have the manpowerp
Negative 2348 pI have some PHP scripts on a server that return cookies, html code, etc. that interact with an iOS app that I have been working on. Things like login, send item, receive item, etc.p  pProblem is maintaining a persistent connection. I figured wed use cookies, and that PHP start session would allow us to access SESSION variables via the cookie. However, Im not able to find any of the session data returned in the cookie, other than the Session ID.p  pI thought I could use the Session ID  a key to grab elements from off the PHP session array by calling a script from within the app. The app isnt the problem so muchp  pI need to know where the SESSION variables actually ARE so I can USE them. That may sound facetious, but that is what I need. p  pIf I start a session, then do something likep  precodeSESSION[username]GET[username] codepre  pShouldnt I be able to return the variable set for that session using the followingp  precodesessionid  GET[sessionid] key  GET[key]  function getSessionValuesessionid, key      sessionstartsessionid     return SESSION[key]   echo getSessionValuesessionid, key codepre  pSomething isnt working...I appreciate any and all help Thanks Dp
Negative 2348 pI was wondering if synchronization or using a concurrent class is necessary, or conversely is it thread safe to use a non concurrent class and do no synchronization on a map in a multi threaded environment, if the only modification to the map is changing the values of the map.p  pThe reason I ask this is the HashMap  and other non concurrent maps documentation  have this commentp  blockquote   pNote that this implementation is not synchronized.   If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of   the threads modifies the map structurally, it imusti be   synchronized externally.  A structural modification is any operation   that adds or deletes one or more mappings merely changing the value   associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a   structural modification.  This is typically accomplished by   synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.p blockquote  pWhich makes me believe if the modification is not structural i.e. There is no  added or deleted I should be able to update the non concurrent map sans synchronization.p  pAm I reading this correct i.e. Is Updating of a value in a map an atomic processp

Negative 2348 pI have two identical SQL Server tables codeSOURCEcode and codeDESTINATIONcode with lots a columns in each.

Negative 2348 pJust to be sure, if you load a page and lets say this page has 3 images. First refere to images1.jpgn, the second to images2.jpg and the third to images1.jpg again. When the page sent to the browser, will the browser make a new request to the server and ask for the image And if the image has already been request like my lets say, it has two time the same image will it request it again or it will know that this imageurl has already been loaded and will just retrieve it from the tempp  pWhich lead to my second question, is there a way to save with javascriptjquery this image on the computer with the download box opening like if you were downloading a file from the temp without having to request it again from the serverp  pI dont know if I am really clear but in short, I want to save an image of the page from the cache and not request a download to the server.p
Negative 2348 pHeres something that has been bugging me... I am currently creating an application for an international corporation naturally I wont name them and they use a specific non standard font for promotional material. Ive asked them to supply this so I can use it in my application and theyre taking forever to get back to me I asked weeks ago and a deadline is pending. Ive noticed on all of their websites they use this same font and incorporate it using the fontface feature.p  pNow the sneaky part of me wondered could I take the font their using within the fontface and install it on my machine so I could finish my work. However then the worried part of me remembered that I have used fontface for other clients and naturally there are distribution issues with such fonts theyre property of the client and not for public use. I really wouldnt want people to be able to install or distribute these.p  pIs it possible for someone to take the fonts Ive used for previous site when incorporating fontface. If these are available to visitors of my sites can I prevent their downloadp  pPerhaps this is something I should lose sleep over...p

Negative 2348 pThe transition from CWPF to HTML5JavaScript is plaguing me. I thought the challenging part would be learning new languages, new ways of thinking about problems, etc. But that was the easy part. The real hurdle is trying to debug an application of any reasonable size using the ridiculous environment known as Firebug. I chose Firebug because it appeared that most people on StackOverflow.com were using it. But man.. I seriously dont see how you guys use this thing. Its so riddled with showstopper bugs. I posted earlier about a major flaw in Firebug when debugging timer callbacks. But todays Firebug experience borders on insanity. p  pShort story is that under certain unknown conditions, if a syntax error is encountered Firebug will, instead of reporting the error, fail to load the entire script file into memory at all and will show no error information whatsoever. Today I dealt with a syntax error that crept in due to a misplaced comma. Any decent debugger would simply highlight the problem and halt execution. Not Firebug. It forces you to investigate file by file, commenting things out one at a time as you try to figure out where on earth the syntax error is. And this isnt just some edge case. Consider this intentionally bad JavaScript fragmentp  precodevar boo boo.SelectEntityPopupXXXfunction     var heyp 1,z 2,goobthis  codepre  pTheres a syntax error. There should be a colon after goob instead of an equals sign. If your app has fifty different JavaScript files, and this bad fragment is in one of them, Firebug wont tell you about it. Itll just fail to load the entire script file into memory. Its up to you to find out which file of the fifty isnt being loaded. Then youve got to randomly commentuncomment the contents of that file until you narrow down that code fragment and realize that theres a bad equals sign in there. Thats absolute madnessp  pFirebug behaves in the expected manner for most syntax errors. But it stumbles on just enough of them to be severely irritating. This, combined with countless other showstopper bugs, make the Firebug environment totally useless for all but the most trivial web apps. So the questions arep  p[1] Is there some kind of syntax error flag or setting that Im missing thats causing this crazy behavior If theres a randomly ignore syntax errors and obfuscate their location checkbox, Id like to uncheck it.p  p[2] There must be a better development environment [for Mac] than Firebug or at least, I cant imagine a WORSE one. Do you have any recommendationsp  pThanks.p  pUPDATE p  pWant to try and insert a comment before this thread is killed for the sake of those who actually care about debugging [as opposed to collecting site gold pieces or whatever these updown votes represent] Its come to my attention that the debugging environments of both Safari and Chrome are far more reliable. I can verify that the syntax errors discussed above are correctly identified in both Safari and Chrome. The major timer callback bug I referenced in my other post is also Firebugspecific.

Negative 2348 pI have the NFL season schedule saved in an SQL Server DB. A codeGamecode table has fields of codeWeekcode referring to the week of the season in which the game takes place [117], codeAwayTeamIDcode, and codeHomeTeamIDcode, among others. The codeAwayTeamIDcode and codeHomeTeamIDcode fields are foreign keys referencing the codeTeamcode table. I want to use a LINQ statement within an ASP.NET MVC 3 app to return games by week, including team names from the codeTeamcode table. I know at least one way to do this, but specifically and Im hoping more elegantly, Id like return a result that has each week associated with a sequence of games that correspond to that week, instead of a returning a sequence of codenew  Game, AwayTeam, HomeTeam code objects and then drilling into the codeGamecode item to get the week. Im not sure Ive made my goal clear...if not, let me know and Ill try to clarify.p  pI read on a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comLINQJoinOperatorsdabef4e9 relnofollow101 LINQ Samplesa about something similar using the codeintocode keyword within a codejoincode statement so that the result would be a sequence of weeks, each associated with its own sequence of games. Using the example from that site, I tried the followingp  precode    string[] wks   1, 2, 3       var model          from g in db.NFLGames         join a in db.NFLTeams on g.AwayTeamID equals a.NFLTeamID         join h in db.NFLTeams on g.HomeTeamID equals h.NFLTeamID         select new TestGameModel  Game  g, AwayTeam  a.Name, HomeTeam  h.Name       var weekgames           from w in wks         join gm in model on w equals gm.Game.NFLWeek into gw         select new TestNflWeeklySchedule  Week  w, Games  gw       foreach var wg in weekgames          System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineNFL week   wg.Week       number of games this week   wg.Games.Count         foreach var g in wg.Games              System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine    g.AwayTeam   at   g.HomeTeam   [  g.Game.DateTimeStart  ]               codepre  pThe code executes, but the output is p  precodeNFL week 1     number of games this week 0 NFL week 2     number of games this week 0 NFL week 3     number of games this week 0 codepre  pApparently, the second query joining the codemodelcode is not matching the games that occur in the designated week. Ive also tried, instead of two queries, just one LINQ statement, which essentially nests the first query within the second. That gave me the same result.p  pCan anyone tell me what error I have in my code or why this is not working Im new to LINQ, so theres a good chance its something simple.p

So Im not suspecting this to be hitting any limit. p  pRequest Headers for a problematic request are as followsp  ul liCacheControl nocacheli liConnection keepaliveli liPragma nocacheli liContentLength 7301li liContentType applicationjson charsetutf8li liAccept applicationjson, textjavascript, emem q0.01li liAcceptEncoding gzip, deflateli liAcceptLanguage enus,enq0.5li liUserAgent Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 rv15.0 Gecko20100101 Firefox15.0.1li liXRequestedWith XMLHttpRequestli ul  pAny ideas p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong  Ive been able to further isolate the problem from our code. Have written an independent controller that accepts a JSON string and just deserializes it. In case of an error, it logs the error. p  pWhen I hit this controller in parallel with 150 concurrent threads in a loop of 50 requests then I get a few failures where the JSON that this controller receives is truncated. Now we are strongly focussed on optimizing IIS and reading more about various parameters that may be related currently we are running with default parameters on IIS. p  pI strongly feel that 150 concurrent connections should not be a big deal and am sincerely hoping that tuning some parameters we should be able to get past this problem. Once we get past this problem, will share my findings. p  hr  pemUpdate 2 October 8 em  I have further narrowed down the problem. I turned on error log in IIS and discovered that my failed request gets the following error while reading datap  precodeBytesReceived  0 ErrorCode  2147943395 Error Description  The IO operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request.0x800703e3 codepre  pI am finding information about this error on iis forums but am yet to experiment with mutliple suggestions being given.

Negative 2348 pMy system is supposed to write a large amount of data into a DynamoDB table every day. These writes come in bursts, i.e. at certain times each day several different processes have to dump their output data into the same table.

Negative 2348 pWe have run into a wall trying to figure out why CSS inheritance does not work as expected. p  pTo describe the problem... I have a reusable CSS that defines various background colors and we switch backgrounds and foregrounds of various sections of the page per user configuration. The problem is that if one of my colors that gets assigned to a parent DIV and is defined further down in the CSS, than it overrides the CSS attributes defined at the child DIV. Case in point is this JSBin example  a hrefhttpjsbin.comabejey1edit relnofollowJSBin linka, where because bgBlack is defined in the CSS file AFTER bgWhite, the user agent is using properties of bgBlack even for contents of the bgWhite DIV We need to make this work otherwise we will be in deep trouble with regards to user being able to switch colors etc. without involving developers.

Negative 2348 pIm just about to start a new pet project and Ive been wondering about how I should go about validation when adding an entity to a parents onetomany collection.  Ill use two example classes to summarize what Im going on about a codeStudentcode and a codeTeachercode. Constraint here is that at any given time a codeStudentcode can only be taught by one and only one codeTeachercode who inturn could be teaching one or more codeStudentcodes.p  precodepublic class Student      public bool IsEnrolled  get set       public virtual Teacher IsCurrentlyBeingTaughtBy  get set    public class Teacher      public virtual ICollectionltStudentgt IsCurrentlyTeaching  get set   codepre  pWhen students arrive at a class I need to assign them to the codeTeachercodes codeIsCurrentlyTeachingcode collection, but I first need to make sure theyre enrolled. My question is where best to validate this basic rule The options going around my head currently arep  pstrong1. Use a repository patternstrongp  pAs Im going to be applying unit tests Im leaning in favor of this method as I can wrap my data access logic up into a mockable object and there is  a single responsibility here so I only have to validate this in my repository once. BUT  is validation the responsibility of the repository, or should I be only dealing with the CRUD of entities in a repositoryp  pstrong2. Validate this in the controller actionstrongp  pI should mention here that I propose this to be an MVC3 project, so keeping specifically to that should I be performing this validation in the controllers action before adding the codeStudentcode to the repository and subsequently the codeTeachercodes list of students theyre currently teaching. BUT  am I heading down a a hrefhttpcodebetter.comiancooper20081203thefatcontroller relnofollowfat controllera path that I really shouldnt bep  pstrong3. Perform this validation on the codeTeachercode entitystrongp  pCutting out the middleman i.e. repository should I be adding the codeStudentcode via a method on the codeTeachercode POCO such as codeAddStudentStudent studentcode and throwing a custom exception when trying to add a student who hasnt been enrolledp  pThere are probably more options available, but these are the three Im trying to choose between at this present moment and Ive got a little tunnel vision from thinking about this. Obviously all of the above can be suitably unit tested but thinking longterm and accommodating growth which path should I be heading downp
Negative 2348 pSo, I created a DataContext LinqSql in VS from an existing database. It has a table called Users, thus I have a codeUsercode object.

The reason for this is so that I can treat any User as an IUser in many places and not be concerned about the precise User classp  precodepublic partial class User  IUser      public int Id               get  return UserID        codepre  pI dont implement the codeUsernamecode get property because I know that the entity object already implements it.p  pWhen I have a query like codedc.Users.SingleOrDefaultp gt p.Id  5code I know that its an error because itll translate that call to an SQL statement and its going to try to find the codeIdcode column, which doesnt exist  UserID exists. So I understand this mapping issue.p  pWhen I query codedc.Users.SingleOrDefaultp gt p.Username  admincode, it also throws an error, BUT codeUsernamecode IS indeed an existing column in the database, so my impression is that no customadditional mapping needs to take place. What am I missingp  pCan someone point me to a good source on how to combat Linq vs. partial classes implement a custom interfacep  pstrongUpdate Questionstrong Before I try it, does anyone know if rigging the datacontext.designer.cs file with our custom interfaces to implement to the classes themselves instead of in a separate partial class file will work Is there a consequence of doing thisp

Negative 2348 pIve got a very large XML file 1.5GB that I need to parse and then insert specific values into a MySQL table.p  pNow the way I would have usually done parsing on a DOM would be to use jQuery or PHP Simple Dom Parser but in this situation, given the file size, I dont think either are suitable.

Ive read a little about SimpleXML and XML Parser for PHP and it seems each have their advantages but Im not sure if either of these are suitable for a file with a size of 1.5GB.p  pIve also seen Pears XML parser mentioned but, again, I dont know if this is suitable in this situation. From what Ive read it seems that I need to load into memory only the required nodes and not the whole tree itself. Even now im having trouble actually viewing the document due to the size. VIM seems to be the only editor that can handle it but even then scrolling through the document can cause a crash.p  pIf anyone can recommend one of these above the other, or even an entirely different solution that would be great.p  pThat would then bring me to my SQL inserts which I was going to do on the fly  so after ive parse a node and pulled the values I require I will insert these into the database. Again, any advice would be great.p

Negative 2348 pI have an IIS Web Server that hosts 400 web applications distributed across 30 application pools. They are both ASP.NET applications and WCF Services end points. The server has 32GB of RAM and is usually running fast although its running at 95 memory usage.

Is there a way to do this None of the options Pocket PC 2002 Emulator, etc. seem to work...the device is attached to the computer via a usb. The Emulators wont work because they dont have the necessary hardware barcode scanner. So I need to use one of the Device options, but have not been able to connect the usb port to XP Mode.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas on how to debug without the constant copyingandreplacing of binaries, and the use of show messagep  h2UPDATEh2  pAlternately, if I cant run the app from within VS 2003  XP Mode as an emulator, it would also be fine to run it on the attached Motorola handheld, attached via usb cable from the cradle to the desktop computer I prefer the former, for the debugging capabilities afforded, but even the latter would be better than my current predicament copying the files to the handheld device, detaching it from the computer, attaching it to the belt printer, firing it up, testing and repeat ad nauseum ad infinitum. ASAP within two hours, I will set a bounty on this question.p  h2UPDATE 2h2  pIf I try to run from VS 2003 in an emulator, and select Windows CE .NET Emulator Default, I getp  pemEmulator for Windows CE will not run within another copy of Emulator for Windows CE.  You just had to try, didnt youemp  p Is it saying this because Im in a VM XP Mode sessionp  pThen I select OK the only option, and get, There were deployment errors. Continue That trick never works it even causes the build to fail a rebuild fixes that, though.p  h2UPDATE 3h2  pPerhaps my problem with not being able to debug by connecting to the device itself is related to this msg I saw when booting up this morning but I dont know what to do about it, IF this is the problem  do I need to search for a new driver for the Motorola MC3100p  precodeDevices or applications disabled.

Negative 2348 pI have a weird problem that Im not even sure how to troubleshoot. Im using VS2008 and SQL Server 2005 yes I know its 2013 .p  pWe have the following code in Visual studio that basically passes in a variable and then creates a string with the stored procedure and then executes the SP with the variable passed as a parameter.p  pWhats weird is that we then get an error stating p  blockquote   pemConversion failed when converting datetime from character stringemp blockquote  pThis is not an unusual error in most cases, but heres where it gets interesting.p  pIf I take the codedestCmd.Commandtextcode string value and paste it into SQL Server and execute, it process quickly and without any errors.  Whats even more ironic is that the stored procedure doesnt return any records which is correct.p  pSo to recap, a stored procedure that when run in SQL Server processes correctly and returns no records accurate, but the same SP when executed from Visual studio is somehow finding a data conversion error even though the SP shouldnt be returning any records.  This behavior isnt something Ive seen before or know how to troubleshoot.p  pI realize I could probably work around this by redoing my SP, but since the SP works in SQL Server Id rather get to the root cause of why Im getting an error when the SP is processed from VS2008.p  pA copy of the stored procedure is added below the c code below.p  precodefor int ii  0 ii lt tmpCountryList.Length ii

Negative 2348 pIm using the image processing toolbox implementation of the Hough transform in Matlab.p  pIt works well, but it puts the origin at the upper left corner of the image and that results in an unnecessarily large Hough image with a lot of unused space.p  pI would like to do the Hough transform with the origin at the center of the image so the radius range will be reduces. Also it is required for an algorithm Im implementing to have the Hough space represented in this way.p  pI dont want to implement the Hough transform from scratch because I dont know mex well enough to reimplement it as efficiently as Matlab. So Ive been trying to take the hough transform Matlab does and transform the hough image in some way to effectively move the origin afterwards.p  pAnyone know an easier way or how to do as I suggestedp

Negative 2348 pstrongQuick Backgroundstrongbr I received code from a third party contracted software that I have to move onto my servers. When I run the code using their connections and service references, everything works well. When I debug locally, everything works well. My problem only occurs when I try to run the applicationservices after I move them onto my server.p  pThe services or their respective references are at the heart of whats causing the issues. I created a test client to try to debug the services, and its accessing the service, but erroring when it tries to connect to the SQL Server inside the service. The code appears to use the Entity Framework which I am admittedly not familiar with yet.p  pstrongErrorsIssuesstrongbr When I use my test client to call a function inside the service reference, it errors out when it tries to connect to my SQL databasep  precodeusing ApplicationDefinitionDBEntities appDefDb  new ApplicationDefinitionDBEntities ERROR codepre  pHeres the error I receive domain and server names have been made generic  p  blockquote   pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException 0x80131904 Login failed for user MYDOMAINAPPSERVERNAME.p blockquote  pI found the codeapp.configcode that is referenced by the code.edmxcode file codeApplicationDefinitionDB.edmxcode and its accompanying files.

So why is the error message in the service ref test client saying that its trying to connect using codeDOMAINAPPSERVERcode as though its using integrated securityp  pI am using IIS to host my app and SQL Server for database work. I think I have updated and regenerated all Entity Framework stuff for the database reference, but I could be missing something. Can anyone suggest anything that I may be missing to make sure the service reference uses the connection string supplied in it, and NOT the app server domain login Thanksp

Negative 2348 pI think this should be easy, but I cannot figure it out.  I have an existing legacy database that Im querying using EF, I have created a couple of POCO classes and as long as issue queries against the dbo schema everything works great. The problem is I cannot issue queries against anyother schema, let say foo.  I tried overriding OnModelCreating and specifying the schema, but it doesnt seems to work... Does anybody knows a  workaround for this For this particular case I only need querying capabilities not insert,  update, etc...  If it is there anything that will works with queries only, it will be great too. Im using EF 5 targeting .NET 4.0 Any help will be apreciated.  Thanksp

Each uniquely named directory on the filesystem contains files uploaded during that particular upload session. That means any sort of database storage method first has to tease apart and iterate over all the files in the filesystem directory created for each upload session by this solution.p  pNote the JQuery solution linked to above doesnt use a form in forms.py inside the app directory. The form is hardcoded into the template, which is already a bit of a bummer...cause now I also have to find a nice way to bind each of the above files in each batch to a form. p  pI emthinkem the simplestalbeit perhaps least performant solutionis to create two views, for two forms...to save each file to the database in the view on the first page, and then update the database on the second page.

Negative 2348 pI am working on building a custom declarative security attribute, similar to the PrincipalPermissionAttribute.  After doing some research on the Attribute architecture within the .net Framework, attributes are instantiated only when Type.GetCustomAttributes is called. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary71s1zwct.aspx relnofollowSee Here,a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1305700netwhenareattributesinstantiatedandcanigetareferencetothetypetheAnd Hereap  pSo how is the PrincipalPermissionAttribute able to assert security actions at runtime if the method attributes were never instantiated  I cannot find any documentation on how the PrincipalPermissionAttribute actually works.  Thanks.p

Negative 2348 pI am basically writing a code which reads a text file, stores it in a string, does some operations with the string and displays it on a dialog, then writes the file if some changes are made.

Negative 2348 pI have a program that can use either GDBM or Kyoto Cabinet as a DBM library. Ive written some functions to abstract away the difference between the two and I pass around void pointers in place of the database file codeGDBMFILEcode in the case of GDBM and codeKCDB code in the case of Kyoto Cabinet. Everything with KC works fine, however when I try using the GDBM backend, the database somehow gets lost in passing it around to different functions. When I try to cast the pointer and dereference it, and then pass that to one of the GDBM functions, it segfaults and in a debugger it complains about the db file not existing.p  pHeres some code that can reproduce the problemp  precodeinclude ltgdbm.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  void  dbopen void    printf openingn   GDBMFILE database  gdbmopen test.db, 512, GDBMWRCREAT,                                   SIRUSR  SIWUSR  SIRGRP  SIWGRP, NULL   if database            printf cannot open databasen       return NULL        void db  ampdatabase   return db   void dbclose void db, void foo    printf dn, int foo   GDBMFILE database  GDBMFILE db   if database            printf database lostn       return        printf closingn   gdbmclose database   return   void fun void db, void foo    GDBMFILE database  GDBMFILE db   datum key, value   int bar  int foo   and yet, if I remove this line and the next    printf dn, bar    one, it works    printf dn, int foo   if database     printf no dbn   key.dptr  baz   key.dsize  4   value.dptr  quux   value.dsize  4   printf storingn   gdbmstore database, key, value, GDBMREPLACE   printf all donen   return   int main void    int foo  5   void dbp  dbopen    void foop  ampfoo   fun dbp, foop   dbclose dbp, foop  codepre  pWhen I run that code, it segfaults with the file not found error on the call to codegdbmclosecode. As the comments indicate, if I dont explicitly store the other void pointer to an int, then the program runs just fine.p  pIn my actual program, it gets lost when I call codegdbmstorecode, and its the only void pointer Im using in this test program, the codefoocode pointer was just supposed to be a sanity check.p  pIm sure there is something in the vagaries of memory allocation in C that Im forgetting or not understanding. Why does the void pointer referencing to the GDBM database get lostcorrupted when the void pointer referencing the int does not Why, when I dont try to store the dereferenced void pointer codefoocode to an int, does it suddenly workp

So the worker project output is an code.execode file that is used by a GUI.p  pHow to debug the worker Is there any possibility of doing it The annoying thing is I can create a command line interface for a worker and generate some kind of reference params for it to run it separatelly, but the problem is when I want to do this for more than one instance I have a program that generates some data async so I have to find an error in my code which works fine in one process, but buggy in more than one.p

I can see practical approaches for emnormalem pointers but they seem just bad practices.p  pCan someone make of case of these alternativesp
Negative 2348 pI have an application actually a plugin for another application that manages threads to communicate with external sensor devices. The external sensors send events to the application, but the application may also send actions to the sensors.  There are several types of devices and each has unique qualities temperature, Pressure, etc. that require special coding. All communications with the sensor devices is over IP. p  pIn the applications, I create a thread for each instance of a sensor. This is an example of the codep  precodeself.phThreadDict[phDevId]  tempsensorself, phDevId, phIpAddr, phIpPort, phSerial, self.triggerDict self.phThreadDict[phDevId].start codepre  pIn each thread I setup callback handlers for events sent by the sensor and then go into a loop at the end.p  precodewhile not self.shutdown     self.plugin.sleep0.5 codepre  pThe threads then handle incoming events and make calls into the main thread, or the actual program that spawned the main thread. All of this works quite well. p  pBut, at times I also need to send requests to a specific sensor. Methods are defined in each thread for that purpose and I call those methods from the main thread. For examplep  precodeself.phThreadDict[dev.id].writeDigitalOutputtextLine, lcdMessage codepre  pThis also works, but I believe the code is actually executed in the main thread rather than in the thread specific to the sensor.p  pMy question is What options do I have for passing work to the specific target thread and having the thread execute the work and then return success or failp

Negative 2348 pWe have an emergency situation with one of our customers. There is live pricing on their site, we perform a jquery request every 5 seconds to an external XML feed. I can restart apache and it immediately ramps up the apache processes to our MaxClients setting 150 httpd processes, thus no longer serving webpages to others. If we block the IP of that external xml feed the server runs great, only 65 httpd processes are running and apache runs great.p  pWe run a LAMP stack. They have under 100 end users on their website at one time varies on a single apache server. What we think may be happening is the external XML feed may be throttling excessive requests from our IP and giving us a 500 or 404 error, perhaps leaving stale apache connections open and never closing them. My first thought was to decrease PHP timeout but thats not a good solution for a single jquery request bringing down our entire webserver.p

Negative 2348 pI have a wiki application that queries and modifies a Git repository per user action view, edit, move, delete a document. The app does this by parsing commands from the user, and translating them into Git CLI commands git show, git log, git lstree, git add, git rm, git commit....p  pFor a given page load, there can potentially be hundreds of Git commands. Though the commands can often be accomplished in lt100ms, the repeated calls add up, causing certain page loads to be obnoxious. Increasingly tricky is that some of the rendered page content is inherently dynamic, meaning that merely caching rendered page outputs is often impossible.p  pI recognized this scaling issue early in the project, and implemented a caching mechanism to get around the worst of it. Being that a Git repo is static until its next commit, any queries with their appropriate parameters as part of the memoization can be cached under the current HEAD commit. This works fairly well, to where many of my page renders with sufficient cache hits can skip calling the Git CLI entirely.p  pWhere this method becomes problematic is during cache invalidation. Lets say you have a commit that updates a files content. For my commit procedure, I have to invalidate and recalculatep  ol liThe cached value for the repositorys HEAD commit codegit revparse HEADcodeli liThe cached value for the files latest commit codegit log n1 FILEcodeli liThe cached value that asks whether this file exists as of commit X codegit lstree r NEWCOMMIT  FILEcodeli ol  pThese cache invalidations propagate outwards, as other functions that depend on the recently moved HEAD commit have to recalculate themselves for example, count of total files in the repository as of new HEAD commit. However, per my example, as I am only updating a page and not moving or removing it, my total file count doesnt have to be recalculated, but my naive caching mechanism cant account for that and has to do it anyway.p  pMy problem hitting save on the application, forcing a codegit commitcode and a large amount of cache invalidation, takes 100x the time it takes a normal page load, and weighs down other pages loads due to outwardly propagating cache invalidations.p  pDespite pivoting my cache around my Git repositorys HEAD commit, the mechanism is still naive. I feel like an intelligent Git cache should be able to note just the movementmodifications of a branchs HEAD, and be able to update its cache. In a 2009 slideshow a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.neterrinsidegithub relnofollowhttpwww.slideshare.neterrinsidegithuba, page 107, Github talks about its Walker cache doing something similar, but I can find no further information on how it accomplished these tasks. I have brought my naive caching mechanism from filebased caching, to memorybased filesystem caching, and now to Memcached, and Im suspicious that my method is reaching its limits.p  pIs there a more idealefficientscalable methodology to produce valid cache values from a Git repository without playing a game of cache invalidation whackamolep  pThanks.p

Negative 2348 pI am reading a lot of Docker guides where the will often use some Ubuntu base image and in the Dockerfile directly or in a bash script that gets copy to container and run on start, it has things like aptget upgradep  pAs i understand it, the container still uses the hosts kernel. So what happens when the aptget upgrade includes a kernel upgrade Does it create a boot and install the files as usual but the underlying LXC has some passthroughwhitelist mechanism for specific directories that always come from host... so it ignores those files in guest container p  pThanks fLop

Negative 2348 pive seen other posts on stackoverflow about this but there hasnt been a solid answer to any of the questions. so im combining the knowledge ive gathered from the other posts and rewording things to hopefully get a solid answer. suPHP is a mod that makes it so that when apache runs scripts, it runs them as the respective owner of said scripts from my understanding, as well as other things. So my problem is that i moved a magento multisite to a new server and this server gives me odd errors when trying to reach the multisites, for example, a permissions error. It says that i cant access the files because the ownership of the files is different than the user trying to readrun them. In addition to that problem, after fixing the symlinks to be owned by the correct user, the contents of the symlinks MUST be owned by the parent store in magento or the entire thing goes down the tubes.p  pFYI the error im getting is the typicalp  precodeInternal Server Error  The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request. Please contact the server administrator, webmasterxxx.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error. More information about this error may be available in the server error log. Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. codepre  pI saw some information that implied this couldnt be fixed at all. But, in addition to that, i saw another page that implied it could be fixed with the apache directive RewriteMap prg. If it can be fixed this way, can somebody please walk me through how to do that If its a lost cause, somebody please tell me. Ive wasted a ton of time on this already and i cant afford to waste any more. Also, if theres a solution to this that i missed, please tell me. thanks guysp

Negative 2348 pI have two list views that are fragments in view pager tabs. When you click on the items in the list view it launches a new activity. But when I press the backbutton to get back to the tabbed list view, the list view has doubled and if I open the activity and go back again it doubles again and it will keep doing that. Also I have another tabbed list view with five tabs and when I go two tabs away from one of the views. The items in that view double when I come back to them and this is the same for all the other tabs. The code for the two listviews is identical. I have tried list.clear, which just clears all of the list items and have played around with the else statement in the view holder recommended by other stack overflow answers. But every time the list view still duplicates. Also unless you havent noticed already Im pretty new to android. p  phere is the code for the list view fragment DueTodayFragment that is in a twotabbed activity.p  precode      import

Negative 2348 pI know I am overthinking this... but the answer is just not clicking.p  pI have two servers, one a TCP socket server and the other a SockJS server. I need to combine both of their connection events into one super eventp  precodeasync.parallel   tcp function done      self.tcp  net.createServerfunction sock        donenull, sock        ,   ws function done      self.ws  sockjs.createServerfunction sock        donenull, sock         , function err, results      This never gets fired     But Id like to do stuff here with both      socket instances  you know, like piping   codepre  pOriginally I had the TCP connection nested within the WS connection, but thats proving to be problematic as it requires a rigid connection sequence. What I really need is an event that is fired when both connections have been established and have access to their respective codesockcode instances. Help jogging the brain would be much appreciatedp
Negative 2348 pIve got some data in my database that is somewhat gridlike in nature.  An item is in a row and a column.p  pIm writing some PHP code to query the database for the data, put it into an internal array, do some processing on it, and then output an HTML table that shows it.p  pMy question is, should the internal array be multidimensional, like thisp  precodemydata[row][column] codepre  pOr should it be flat, like thisp  precodemydata[row .  . column] codepre  pThe code is going to potentially run frequently its a live refresh that multiple users might look at so Id like whichever is most efficient.  My gut reaction says that the flat array will be slower from the string concatenation while the multidimensional array will be slower from the nested lookup.p  pI have considered not storing the data temporarily and just outputting the table directly from the data itself.  Unfortunately the nature of the postprocessing means that I cannot do that certain display attributes need to change based on later rows and columns.p
Negative 2348 pi have a multipage form that i am trying to validate using jquery validate. the user has essentially 4 options codenextcode, codeprevcode, codesavecode, codesubmitcode.p  pcodesavecode, codenextcode, and codeprevcode all save the current page to the form as a whole codesubmitcode is the same as codesavecode, but fires some additional workflowrelated functions then heads off to another part of the site.p  pi need to validate the user input at all times. the jquery validate is working great. but... i need to have some fields set as required. because the form is saved at each step, the input needs to always be valid, but i dont need the required validation until the very end on codesubmitcode.p  pthe form is building a dynamic list of validations specific to the page it is on, likep  precodedocument.readyfunction      ctl01.validate onsubmit false      Qn0e868ebe.rulesadd,  maxlength 200      Qnd69e75a4.rulesadd,  number true      Qnadffbdec.rulesadd,  maxlength 200      Qnadffbdec.rulesadd,  digits true   codepre  pso now, for required fields, ive added a code.isrequiredcode class to them, and ive decoupled the codeltasplinkbuttongtcodes to fire this client scriptp  precodefunction FormIsValidsender, ishardsubmit      var form  ctl01     form.validate     if form.valid          if ishardsubmit              if IsRequiredValid  return false                   doPostBacksender,           return  codepre  pthis part the input validation part is working great so far. the part i commented out is the part that is working not so great. it fires this function, in which i was trying to dynamically add required validators and reevaluate the form. i can see it hit the .each loop for each of my required fields, but it doesnt seem to be working since it passes codetruecode back, even when required fields are empty.p  precodefunction IsRequiredValid      var requiredgroup  .isrequired     requiredgroup.eachfunction i, item          item.rulesadd,  required true           form.validate     return form.valid  codepre  pi toyed with the idea of dropping the .net required field validators in to do this part, but i want to, if possible, stick with a single solution. especially since this feels emsoem close to working.p  pthoughts help thanksp

Negative 2348 pSo basicaly Im trying to get some informations off several pages headers and to do so im using getheaders. Now as long as the http response is 200, thats fine no problem the array show informations like ContentType being a key and thats good enough for me I can check its value.p  pThe issue shows when the response code is 301 in which case the array becomes a multi layers array and this is the end of it for me...I cannot figure out how to easily get to the ContentType value I dont care about what key it is as long as I get the value obviously.p  pI thgouth I could run several loops checking the array values one by one but that seems to be a massive script for such a small looking issue.p  pSo my question is  is there anyway to either flatten the array I get as an output array below, or is there a way native to php to look for a regular expression within a multi layers array p  p301  p  precodearray12      [0]  gt string30HTTP1.0 301 Moved Permanently [Date]  gt array2          [0]  gt string29Thu, 06 Feb 2014 130419 GMT [1]  gt string29Thu, 06 Feb 2014 130420 GMT     [Server]  gt array2          [0]  gt string6Apache [1]  gt string6Apache     [Vary]  gt array2          [0]  gt string22Cookie,AcceptEncoding [1]  gt string22AcceptEncoding,Cookie     [SetCookie]  gt array3          [0]  gt string200wordpress27e1f2dfbb852bd4e4295b075bfa297f7C13929014607C6714e772e8aadf7ef19238b8c45faaf5 expiresFri, 21Feb2014 010420 GMT pathwpcontentplugins domainwww.domain.com httponly [1]  gt string190wordpress27e1f2dfbb852bd4e4295b075bfa297f7C13929014607C6714e772e8aadf7ef19238b8c45faaf5 expiresFri, 21Feb2014 010420 GMT pathwpadmin domainwww.domain.com httponly [2]  gt string192wordpressloggedin27e1f2dfbb852bd4e4295b075bfa297f7C13929014607Ccd60c9eaeab6cf8e770eb7a121440e5f expiresFri, 21Feb2014 010420 GMT path domainwww.domain.com httponly     [XPingback]  gt string43httpwww.domain.comxmlrpc.php [Location]  gt string38httpwww.domain.comacces [Connection]  gt array2          [0]  gt string5close [1]  gt string5close     [ContentType]  gt array2          [0]  gt string24texthtml charsetUTF8 [1]  gt string24texthtml charsetUTF8     [1]  gt string15HTTP1.1 200 OK [CacheControl]  gt string26maxage3, mustrevalidate [WPSuperCache]  gt string31Served supercache file from PHP  codepre  pJust in case you need it, heres my code  p  precodepublic function checkhttp          if SESSION[started]  1              headers  getheadersSESSION[nextpage], 1         headers[ContentType] will return the expected value if response is 200                 ifpregmatch200202300301302, headers[0]  pregmatchhtml, headers[ContentType]                 SESSION[nextpage]  SESSION[pagelist][0]                 SESSION[pagelistdone][]  SESSION[pagelist][0] .

Negative 2348 pI am using Liferay and I have created 3 user groups. My application is like ,the user will be able to switch user groups in the UI using a drop down. When I login for a specific user group the pages are visible according to user group. p  pBut when I switch user groups, the pages do not change according to user groups. Logs show that the change in user group is detected. The same was working in liferay 5. Please suggest what has to be done. p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 2348 pI am trying to understand the basic multithreading mechanisms in the new C 11 standard. The most basic example I can think of is the followingp  ul liA producer and a consumer are implemented in separate threadsli liThe producer places a certain amount of items inside a queueli liThe consumer takes items from the queue if there are any presentli ul  pThis example is also used in many school books about multithreading and everything about the communication process works fine. However, I have a problem when it comes to stopping the consumer thread. p  pI want the consumer to run until it gets an explicit stop signal in most cases this means that I wait for the producer to finish so I can stop the consumer before the program is ended. Unfortunately C 11 threads lack an interrupt mechanism which I know from multithreading in Java for example. Thus, I have to use flags like codeisRunningcode to signal that I want a thread to stop.p  pThe main problem now is After I have stopped the producer thread, the queue is empty and the consumer is waiting on a codeconditionvariablecode to get a signal when the queue is filled again. So I need to wake the thread up by calling codenotifyallcode on the variable before exiting.p  pI have found a working solution, but it seems somehow messy. The example code is listed below I am sorry but somehow I couldnt reduce the code size any furhter for a minimal minimal examplep  pThe Queue classp  precodeclass Queue public     Queue  misProgramStopped false         void pushint i         stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockmmtx         mq.pushi         mcond.notifyone           int pop         stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockmmtx         mcond.waitlock, [amp] return mq.empty  misProgramStopped           if misProgramStopped             throw stdexceptionProgram stopped                   int x  mq.front         mq.pop          stdcout ltlt Thread  ltlt stdthisthreadgetid ltlt  popped  ltlt x ltlt . ltlt stdendl         return x           void stop         misProgramStopped  true         mcond.notifyall       private     stdqueueltintgt mq     stdmutex mmtx     stdconditionvariable mcond     bool misProgramStopped  codepre  pThe Producerp  precodeclass Producer public     ProducerQueue amp q  mq q , mcounter 1         void produce         for int i  0 i lt 5 i             mq.pushmcounter             stdthisthreadsleepforstdchronomilliseconds 500                     void execute         mt  stdthreadampProducerproduce, this           void join         mt.join       private     Queue amp mq     stdthread mt      unsigned int mcounter  codepre  pThe Consumerp  precodeclass Consumer public     ConsumerQueue amp q  mq q , mtakeCounter 0 , misRunning true             Consumer         stdcout ltlt KILL CONSUMER  TOOK  ltlt mtakeCounter ltlt . ltlt stdendl           void consume         while misRunning             try                 mq.pop                 mtakeCounter                          catch stdexception e                 stdcout ltlt Program was stopped while waiting. ltlt stdendl                                 void execute         mt  stdthreadampConsumerconsume, this           void join         mt.join           void stop         misRunning  false       private     Queue amp mq     stdthread mt      unsigned int mtakeCounter     bool misRunning  codepre  pAnd finally the codemaincodep  precodeint mainvoid     Queue q      Consumer cons q      Producer prod q       cons.execute     prod.execute      prod.join      cons.stop     q.stop      cons.join      stdcout ltlt END ltlt stdendl      return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pIs this the emrightem way to end a thread that is waiting an a condition variable or are there better methods Currently, the queue needs to know if the program has stopped which in my opinion destroys the loose coupling of the components and I need to call codestopcode on the queue explicitly which doesnt seem right.p  pAdditionaly, the condition variable which should just be used as a singal if the queue is empty now stands for another condition  if the program has ended. If I am not mistaken, every time a thread waits on a condition variable for some event to happen, it would also have to check if the thread has to be stopped before continuing its execution which also seems wrong.p  pDo I have these problems because my entire design is faulty or am I missing some mechanisms that can be used to exit threads in a clean wayp
Negative 2348 pI have this algorithm that Im implementing that I need to change to give it a better accuracy. To give you an idea of the problem, I have a a bunch of lists that contain items and all items in these lists have been given ratings by users. I need to compute the a weight of these list such as the higher the weight the better the list better as in it has items with good ratings by users. What I have done so far is compute the average of each item in a list L, sum them, and divide by the number of items in that list L, so the weight of a list L would be, Sumaverages in LSizeL. Just a simple mean average. This turns out to be a good measurement, but I want to incorporate the fact that items can occur inside multiple lists, and the more an item is found in many lists, it means the higher the weight of the list should be.p  pMy stat knowledge is limited, thus all Im asking is help or direction or any suggested topics that I can readlearn to be able to optimize the algorithm to the best it can possibly get.p

Negative 2348 pI have an application capturing sampled data and writing the samples into a shared memory segment  structured as a circular buffer. I have a 2nd application reading the shared memory. All of the shared memory is using a mutex for proper serialization. I have complete control over the 1st application for starting and stooping the capture process using a msg queue channel for control.p  pMy question is regarding the proper way to architect the read thread of the 2nd application that will read the shared memory segment to process the data. Currently I have written basic test routines to verify that the reading of shared memory is accurate and that the mutex is functioning correctly. But I am not really sure of how best to design the actual reading thread for the 2nd application.p  pI really like the simplicity of a dedicated pthread that uses select to block until data is ready to be read. I use this design a lot, but this approach does not seem to fit when using shared memory because a file descriptor is not associated with the shared memory segment so I cannot use select. For some reason using a pthread with a while loop with a periodic call to sleep just does not seem like the proper way to do this. p  pSo my question is what is the elegant way to architect the read thread to block until data has been written into the shared memory by the 1st application The only way I can think of is to use an additional msg queue to send the 2nd application a msg each time I want it to read a buffer from the shared memory segment. Is there a more elegant wayp  pThanks, Andresp

Negative 2348 pIn my application I am using a custom codeUIElementcode, which handles its own layout and rendering. While I can unit test most of it, I cannot properly unit test the rendering. The reason is that rendering is done via the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.uielement.onrender.aspx relnofollowOnRendera method, but I have no way to test what actually gets rendered, since the DrawingContext is an abstract class with an internal constructor, so I cant derive from it for testing purposes.p  pThe only testing I know how to do is trying different scenarios based on the implemented code and checking that no exceptions are getting thrown. Is there any way to test more besides using TypeMock Isolator or JustMockp

Negative 2348 pIm having some problems understanding divide and conquer algorithms. Ive read that in order to apply recursion successfully you need to have a recursive leap of faith and you shouldnt bother with the details of every step, but Im not really satisfied with just accepting that recursion works if all the conditions are fulfilled, because it seems like magic to me at the moment and I want to understand why it works.p  pSo Im given the following recursive algorithm of finding a maximum subarray in pseudocodep  precodeFindMaximumSubarrayA, low, high if high  low     return low, high, A[low] else     mid  [low  high2]     leftlow, lefthigh, leftsum  FindMaximumSubarrayA, low, mid     rightlow, righthigh, rightsum  FindMaximumSubarrayA,mid  1, high     crosslow, crosshigh, crosssum  FindMaxCrossingSubarrayA,low, mid, high     if leftsum gt rightsum and leftsum gt crosssum         return leftlow, lefthigh, leftsum     else if rightsum gt leftsum and rightsum gt crosssum         return rightlow, righthigh, rightsum     else         return crosslow, crosshigh, crosssum codepre  pwhere the FindMaxCrossingSubarray algorithm is given by the following pseudocodep  precodeFindMaximumCrossingSubarrayA, low, mid, high leftsum  INF sum  0 for i  mid down to low     sum  sum  A[i]     if sum gt leftsum         leftsum  sum         maxleft  i rightsum  INF sum  0 for j  mid  1 to high     sum  sum  A[j]     if sum gt rightsum          rightsum  sum         maxright  j return maxleft, maxright, leftsum  rightsum codepre  pNow when I try to apply this algorithm to an example, Im having a hard time understanding all the steps.p  pThe array is broken down using the indices, without actually changing the array itself until high equals low. I thinks this corresponds to the first call, so FindMaximumSubarray is first called for all the terms on the left of the array, until highlow1. Then low, high, A[low] is returned which would be 1, 1, A[1] in this case. Now I dont understand how those values are processed in the remainder of the call.p  pFurthermore I dont understand how the algorithm actually compares subarrays of lengths  1. Can anybody explain to me how the algorithm continues once one of the calls of the function has bottomed out, pleasep

Negative 2348 pIve read several tutorials, articles and questions here on stackoverflow, including the python doc, but all of them are using a single instance variable in their examples, making it difficult to see how python properties would work if you have more than one.p  pAt first i thought the property function was created to be able to set or get any property so you could only create one get and one set method and then any number of instance variables which would use these, but this doesnt seem to be the casep  pIf I have the following code taken straight from the official doc on propertyp  precodeclass Cobject     def initself         self.x  None      def getxself         return self.x     def setxself, value         self.x  value     def delxself         del self.x     x  propertygetx, setx, delx, Im the x property. codepre  pYou have one method getx and one method setx in addition to the deleter method delx. What if i also need a couple of more instances variables like y and z, do i then need to write the following codep  precodeclass Cobject     def initself, x, y, z         self.x  None         self.y  2         self.z  4      def getxself         return self.x     def getyself         return self.y     def getzself         return self.z      def setxself, value         self.x  value     def setyself, value         self.y  value     def setzself, value         self.z  value      def delxself         del self.x     def delyself         del self.y     def delzself         del self.z      x  propertygetx, setx, delx, Im the x property.     y  propertygety, sety, dely, Im the y property.     z  propertygetz, setz, delz, Im the z property. codepre  pThe above code looks a lot like java settersgetters, and the reason for using property in python seems to be exactly to avoid this, so are you meant to be using some sort og general gettersetter instead p  pPlease dont bash me with tons of 1, im just trying to understand this and i have read quite a bit to try to avoid posting this people often get annoyed it seems when people arent a master in python.p
Negative 2348 pI am using a NioSctpServerChannel connection with Netty between two different machines. The connection is established successfully and receives data after the clients channelActiveHandler sends some data to the server.p  pThe receiving interface seems to be another than the binding interface 192.168.122.1 instead of 192.168.243.31  is this a system or netty problemp  pThen a heartbeat is sent via a complete different interface in this case a virbr 192.168.122.1 and is answered with an abort which destroys the connection.

If I change the codeltglobalizationgtcode attributes to german cultures or just remove the node as by system language is german, the serverside validation message is german too.p  pThis let me believe there might be a difference in times when serverside and clientside take their messages from resources. And maybe the serverside does it prior to executing the action, which means codeCultureFilter.OnActionExecutingcode is called after that, which of course is too late in this case.p  pSo I tried to set the culture on begin request global.asaxp  precodeprotected void ApplicationBeginRequest      Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfode  codepre  pWell, that did the trick. But I really think this is an ugly solution. So...p  h2The Question Am I Right and Do I Have Any Other Optionsh2  pIs it true, that serverside validation takes the messages from resource before a filter could set the culture If not, what am I doing wrong If yes, is there another, cleaner option for setting the culture than the global.asax hackp  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 2348 pIn Emacs orgmode, is there a way to automatically refile highlighted text under an org heading i.e. to cut the highlighted text and automatically paste it under the orgheading of my choice p  pYou could call it codeorgrefileregioncode. Similar to codeorgrefilecode, but to refile not the entire subtree, but only the highlighted region under any heading in the current document. p  pUPDATEp  pIdeally this functionality would be independent of the orgagenda files used by orgrefile, so as to avoid displaying irrelevant headings as possible targets. p  pCurrently this is doable by doing 1. select text 2. cut 3. otherwindow 4. navigate to desired target heading 5. paste text 6. other windowp  pThe proposed new function would make this much more efficient 1. select text 2. orgrefileregion 3. choose target p  pThe most useful form of this would allow you to choose a target from among any currently open documents. My use case involves selecting text from one buffer and refiling it from among orgheadings in another buffer, i.e. moving text from a source document displayed in one window and refiling to targets within the hierarchy of a target document displayed in another window, like so p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comE729fCQ.png altp

Negative 2348 pI have a spreadsheet that I only want users to modify by running a script.  The script is a UiApp that has a few predefined input fields and text boxes and the results are submitted onto the spreadsheet.  Because I only want the document modified from this app, I have to set the permissions of the spreadsheet to Can comment.  However, in doing this, the users cannot run the script because the script edits the page and they dont have editing rights to the page.  So I assume that I need to create a web app.p  pThe web app would be standalone and would run as me the owner so that calls to the app would allow the submitted data to be written to the spreadsheet.  My web app looks something like thisp  precodefunction doGet     var app  UiApp.createApplication     UiApp elements are added here    return app   codepre  p...and the works fine when the url is accessed directly from the browser.  However, I would like for the app to open wi the spreadsheet from a spreadsheet trigger.  I was thinking something like thisp  precodevar app  UrlFetchApp.fetchurl var ss  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet ss.showapp codepre  p...but this is not working.  The error I get is Invalid argument userInterface line 12, file Web App.  Line 12 is ss.showapp.  I was hoping that the app object would be returned from UrlFetch, but I now know that an HTTPResponse is returned.  p  pHow can I convert this response into a UiApp object  Thanks.p

Negative 2348 pIn golang, it seems there are no constructors, but it is suggested that you allocate an object of a struct type using a function, usually named by New  TypeName, for examplep  precodefunc NewRectx,y, width, height float Rect       return ampRectx,y,width, height  codepre  pHowever, I am not sure about the memory layout of Go. In CC, this kind of code means you return a pointer, which point to a temporary object because the variable is allocated on the stack, and the variable may be some trash after the function return. In Golang, do I have to worry such kind of thing Because It seems no standard shows that what kind of data will be allocated on the stack vs what kind of data will be allocated on the heap.p  pAs in Java, there seems to have a specific point out that the basic type such as int, float will be allocated on the stack, other object derived from the object will be allocated on the heap. In golang, is there a specific talk about thisp

Negative 2348 pIm having a bit of trouble with divide and conquer algorithms and was looking for some help. I am attempting to write a function called sumArray that computes the sum of an array of integers. p  pThis function must be done by dividing the array in half and performing recursive calls on each half. I have tried to use similar concepts to those I employed when writing recursive sum algorithms and a divide and conquer algorithm for identifying the maximum element in an array, but I am struggling to combine the two ideas.p  pBelow is the code I have written for sumArray, which compiles, but does not return the correct result. p  precodeint sumArrayint anArray[], int size      int total  0     base case     if size  0              return 0          else if size  1              return anArray[0]           divide and conquer     int mid  size  2     int lsum  anArray [mid]  sumArrayanArray, mid     int rsize  size  mid     int rsum  anArray[size  mid]  sumArrayanArray  mid, rsize     return lsum  rsum  codepre  pI have identified the problem as being that the function includes the value of lsum in its calculation of rsum. I know the issue lies within my recursive call to sumArray using rsize  a variable that is equal to the size of the original array, minus the midpoint. For some reason, however, I cannot seem to identify a fix. p  pI feel silly asking, as I know the answer is staring me right in the face, but how do I repair my function so that it returns an accurate resultp  pemUPDATE Thanks to all the helpful responses, I have fixed my code and so that it compiles and runs nicely. I will leave my original code here in case others are struggling with divide and conquer and might be making similar mistakes. For a function that correctly solves the problem, see Laura Ms answer. The response by haris also gives a good explanation of where my code was incurring errors.emp

So for an array of timestamps in scope.data.stamps, I would create scope.formattedDates.p  p2 When the user submits changes, then I go through those equivalent variables, reformat them to stamps and put them where they belong in the model i.e. scope.data.p  pWhile this works, it obviously is not ideal as it doesnt update the model directly while other parts of the model are bound directly to parts of scope.data. So I wonder if there is a way to set it up so that I bind to the real model variables scope.data.stamps in the example above and have this reformatting happen in either direction of the twoway data bindp  pThanks in advance for any helpp

So, the validations are looking at the params before the parent id is associated with the child...and therefor failing.  This seems strange.  Why is rails running validation at a stage in form submission before the parent of the nested attributes is correctly associatedp  pIs there a rails way for handling this scenariop

Negative 2348 pI need help finding out why my isPrivate is getting a null value. Im trying to display messages that has an option chose to be either a Private message or a Public message onto a dashboard. If someone choose the option of a Public message, it would display to everyone who is logged on to the website. If its a Private message, only I can view the message. The problem is since isPrivate keeps on getting a null value, either option I choose would be False because I have converted isPrivate into a Boolean. Any help would be greatly greatly appreciated.

Negative 2348 pIm trying to make a python dictionary that takes user input, splits it into a list of two indices, takes the second index as the dictionary key and the first as the dictionary value  but cast as a Tuple. Hope that makes sense I have it working, but when I enter another input with the same key, I want the new value appended to the tuple already in the dictionary. I get that tuples are immutable and there is no append or so I think so what magic do I need to sprinkle to get it to add to the tuple in the dictionaryp  pMy code so far isp  precodedesserts    namevote  input Namevote   while namevote     nocolonnamevote  namevote.replace,     name, vote  nocolonnamevote.split   name  tuple[name]   if vote not in desserts     desserts[vote]  name   else     desserts[vote].appendname   this is where Im hitting a brick wall   namevote  input Namevote   printdesserts codepre  pAnd my desired output from two inputs should bep  precodeNamevote Lukeicecream Namevote Bobicecream Namevote  icecream Luke, Bob codepre
Negative 2348 pUsing Spark 1.1p  pI have a job that does as followsp  ol liReads a list of folders under a given root, parallelize the listli liFor each folder, read the files under it  these are gzipped filesli liFor each file, extract the content  these are lines, each line represent a single event, with fields separated with tabs TSVli liCreate a single RDD of all the lines. li liConvert the TSV to json.li ol  pNow the lines represent a certain event type. There are 4 types Session, request, recommendation, user eventp  ol start6 liFilter out session events only. Sample only 1100 of them according to some user id field. Convert them to a pair, with a key that represents some output structure like event typedatethe events, then write it to FS.li liDo the same for requests and user eventsli ol  pFor recommendations, the sampling cannot be done according to user id since it does not exist there, but we know there is a 11 relationship between request and recommendation based on a mutual request id field. Sop  ol start8 liCreate a list of distinct request ids. join this list with the recommendations list based on request id as key, therefore achieve the filtering we want. Then output the reduced list to FS.li ol  pNow, Here is my problem. The code I use to do those things work for small scale. But when I run on relatively large input, and I use a cluster of 80 machines with 8 cores and 50GB memory each, I can see that many machines are not utilized, meaning only one core is occupied and also only 20, and memory is only at 16GB out of 40GB configured to the job.p  pI think somewhere my transformations do not get parallelized well, but I am not sure where and why.

Negative 2348 pI am reading a pipe delimited file, and loading to a table in a MySQL database. I eventually need to have this script run off an application server in Oregon, and load to the table in North Carolina. So yes, I realize there is going to be a sizeable network latency involved. Also, to address this to some extent, I made sure I was performing array inserts, and not rowbyrow. p  pHowever, I am confused as to why I am seeing a dramatic difference in performance when I do this through Java, and MySQL JDBC versus, using PerlDBI. When I run my inserts in batch sizes of 1000 rows at a time, Perl finishes in 8 seconds, while the java application takes 137 seconds 2 mins and 17 secs p  pI didnt expect identical performance, but not a dramatic difference as this.

Negative 2348 pFor some reason a server running IIS 7.5 is suddenly throwing 401.1 errors and not allowing users to log in even with basicwindows authentication running. To make it even more confusing, not all apps on the server show the error but all apps are using the same base code. The user is prompted to provide credentials even though it should not require them and IIS refuses all valid input. I tried looking up the scwin32status code of 2148074254 but that didnt reveal much. I see no differences in sites that work and sites that dont. Each app has its own application pool and all are configured the same. One temp fix that appears to work for now is I changed the app pool identity from applicationPoolIdenity to LocalService. But note that I still have a site that works with the original settings. Also note that this all worked fine previously but without any changes it started to refuse to access windows authentication. Also note that when logged directly into the server ALL sites work no matter how configured when using a local browser. p  pDue to the strange behavior I suspect a network issue of some sort but I could use some help understanding it. My goal is to find a fix to prevent it in the future. p

Negative 2348 pThis looks like a huge pile, but its actually a very focused question. This looks bigger than it is because I am providing context and what I have been able to work out so far.p  pLet me start with the question in more precise terms strongUsing an ASP.NET webpage, how can I a attach a saved PDF file to a database table using a Formview, and b allow the user to view that saved PDF file when the database table row is selected in a Gridviewstrongp  pWhile I can easily store the path and filename of the PDF file, if the PDF file is renamed, moved, or deleted, the database record now has a broken link. My client has requested that I attach the actual PDF file to the database record to prevent broken links.p  pThat answers the why because my client requested it. Now its a matter of figuring out how.p  pemHere is what I have done up to now in my researchemp  ol liI learned how to enable Filestream for a SQL Server 2012 database.li liI created a table where one of the columns is a varbinarymax. Table definition language shown below in Code Block 1.li liUsing available online examples, I was able to test and verify a working TSQL script  however, I have not yet succeeded in making this a stored procedure because I do not know how to make the filename a variable in an Openrowset statement . Script shown below in Code Block 2. li ol  pWhere Im drawing the big blank is the ASP.NET side of the equatiion. Here is the system I hope to set up.  Im not as restricted in terms of the details so long as they work along these lines.p  ol liUser uses the Formview connected to the database via SqlDataSource to type in the values entered on the paper form, and finally attach the saved PDF file to the ScannedPDFFile field.li liA gridview immediately refreshes, showing the results from the ScannedPDFs table, allowing the user to select a row and view the saved PDF file.li ol  pIs this approach possible Any directions of further research would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2348 pIm implementing an inductive wrapper that automatically extracts HTML fields. Ive crawled magabytes of raw HTML pages and now I need to label different sections to build the training set, which will be used to learn a model.p  pMy question is how I can create the features and class labels to build it Since its very different from traditional tasks where the features and class labels are obvious. It seems that the most common way is to use a software that the user can classify HTML sections visually, but Im not aware of any existing system. That would be great if someone can provide some clues. Thanks a lot.p
Negative 2348 pHow do I find rows that have duplicate values in one column but different values in another column. I have a database of cities with latitude and longitude. I would like to find all rows that have a duplicate in the city name column but have different latitude and longitude. For example, paris,france and paris,texas have the same city name paris but different latitude and longitude, so they would both be included in the query results. But it should not return rows that have duplicate city names and duplicate latitudelongitude values.p
Negative 2348 pi am also worried about how to make u guys understand about my problem and share my experience. i am learning C.in previous, i used the Codeblocks IDE to compile and run C code.i learned that as a beginner it would better to use cmd to compile and run code than IDE. i am using windows 8. Before i was not use to with cmd, i also learned  that to be a advance user and good programer i should know the use of cmd well.  After setting the environment variable started to compile c code by cmd by the following commandp  pgcc o executable file name               C source code file namep  pit craete a .exe file. but no .o file. when i worked with IDE, also a .o file was found with .exe p  ol liwhat is the possible reason for itli ol  pafter compiling the code, i ran it by calling executable file name. and when checked the directory, then a .exe file was found. but now the problem is, recently i am compiling and running code, i found that there is no .exe file created, but a file has created with  unknown extensionstrongPOINTERWHILE File .pointerWhilestrongcopied from file properties. this unknown extension file is only runing by the cmd. it may be the one part of my source code file name. the code has given below and the name of source code.p  pName of source code Example184.1.pointerWhilep  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt main     char p  stop   char str[80]    do           printfEnter a String       getsstr        whilestrcmpp,str   codepre  pthis program will take input until, stop entered.p  pthis kind of things happened for several other files.then i copy them, to an another folder and compile and run but the same result.p  pi complied and run the same code form same folder and other folder by codeblocks, the result is same. the file is only running when it is in IDE. p  pthen make an another file with other name in same directory and other, but the same code. then it is creating .exe file. p  p2.what may the cause for creating .exe filep

Negative 2348 pI am wondering which would be the advantages of using the T3 framework while building a responsive website design on top of the Joomla CMS.p  pI dont really need all the bootstrap stuff and all the modules it can offer, costumization of the source files is quite tricky too. p  pWould it be beneficial building my website using T3, or should I stick to my own style and methodsp  pThanks, Ved.p
Negative 2348 pI have a project structure as follows. A.dll depends on B.exe, B.exe depends on custom target C. The custom target C generates some files, which B.exe packages in an archive as a post build step on target B. BRWhen I first build A.dll, since it is the first time B.exe gets built and as a post build step myArchieve.a gets built. From then on if I build the A.dll, B.exe doesnt get rebuilt, since its an executable and it exists because of a previous build. The problems because of this are  br1. I always have a stale executable br2. If I make some changes to C and trigger a build of A.dll, cmake just rebuilds C and A. It doesnt rebuild B.exe and as a result it missed the archieve step and my archieve never gets updated.p  pIs there a solution to this problem  I have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12182203executablenotrebuiltbutobjectfilesrecompiledthisa link already and doesnt help much.p
Negative 2348 pIm using matlab psychtoolbox with openAL to make a pink noise burst moving slowly from left to right in the virtual space. The sound should move at 1 meter in front of the listener, in a straight line. I tried to modify the openAL demo I found i.e. AudioTunnel3D. I managed to have the sound moving from left to right by updating the position on the x axis with a for loop. Though, I guess there is a better way, e.g. by using all the functions AL.VELOCITY AL.DIRECTION that openAL provide. Plus the result I got is not satisfacting the sound get closer to the left hear and then kind of jump on the other side and then slowly fade away. Though, right now Im a bit stuck, can you help me move one step forward maybe giving me a hint about how to use the velocity and direction parameters properly.

Negative 2348 pIm trying to run through a buffer overflow exercise, here is the code p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int badfunction    char buffer[8]   getsbuffer   putsbuffer   int cantrun     printfThis function cant run because it is never called    int main     badfunction   codepre  pThis is a simple piece of code. The objective is to overflow the buffer in codebadfunctioncodeand override the return address having it point to the memory address of the function codecantruncode.p  pStep 1 Find the offset of the return address in this case its 12bytes, 8 for the buffer and 4 for the base pointer. p  pStep 2 Find the memory location of codecantruncode, gdb say its 0x0804849a. p  pWhen I run the program codeprintf 012xx9ax84x04x08  .vulncode, I get the error illegal instruction. This suggests to me that I have correctly overwritten the EIP, but that the memory location of codecantruncode is incorrect. p  pI am using Kali Linux, Kernel 3.14, I have ASLR turned off and I am using execstack to allow an executable stack. Am I doing something wrongp  pUPDATEp  pAs a shot in the dark I tried to find the correct instruction by moving the address around and 0x0804849b does the trick. Why is this different than what GDB shows. When running GDB, 0x0804849a is the location of the prelude instruction codepush ebpcode and 0x0804849b is the prelude instruction codemov ebp,espcode. p

Negative 2348 pWhile running a DelayedJobs queue that uses WatirWebdriver with Headless and Firefox to get some data off the web a few times per hour, I am encountering random codeEOFErrorcode and codeECONNREFUSEDcode errors.p  pIts a reasonably simple script that goes to a site, logs in, enters data in a form and verifies the data returned.

But everytime the system updates an object it refreshes de whole view. I would like only one item to be updated. Thanksp

Negative 2348 pI have a question associated with curly braces in switchcase blockp  precode switch conditon        case val1         something         break    case val2         something         break     default    break    codepre  por something like this p  precode switch conditon        case val1         something        break        case val2         something        break         default    break    codepre  pA I know both codes should work the same way but I think there is some irrationalities here.  As the break should cause jumping out from curly braces block so theoretically second code should do smoothen like this  1. break course jumping out of block  2. switch continues execution case val2  or default cause outside the braces there isnt any break statement. p  pWhich version you recommend to use and Are they really working the same wayp

Negative 2348 pWhen working on multiple projects, I am using a MacVim window for each specific project, with tabs for files in the project. I have codemvimcode aliased to codemvim remotetabsilentcode which opens a file in a new tab. The problem I have is that the file is always opened in the window for the first project and it might be the case that I am trying to open a file from the second project and respectively in the second window.p  pSo the question really is  is there a way to check the files already open in all windows and open the new file as a tab in the window containing files from a directory closest to the file in question. I realise this is a very specific use case, but would be happy to hear any ideas.p

Negative 2348 pI am building a Windows Store application in XAMLC for a Windows 8.1 Professional environment.p  pMy project has a requirement that I must support multiple languages in addition to multiple translations for any given language. For example, I may have a label that would be displayed in English or French, but in English it may need to display the word Title or the word Heading depending on the customers preferences.p  pMy issue is that I cannot figure out a way to package and switch between multiple resource dictionaries for the same language while still using the builtin localization functionality provided by XAML for WinRT i.e. using the Uid property on my controls to bind them to a resource dictionary.p  pIve noticed two functions, ResourceManager.LoadPriFiles and ResourceManager.UnloadPriFiles, that I thought might allow me to swap out resource dictionaries at runtime, but I cant figure out how to get the PRI files to be package outside of the applications main resource map to allow the loading and unloading.p  pIve also considered creating a custom data binding or converter that I could use to bind the controls text manually, but that would cost me the ability to see labels at design time in Blend as well as sacrificing the convenience of the builtin localization capabilities.p  pAnother option was to compile a separate instance of the application for each of the custom translations the customer might require, but obviously thats not a very maintainable way of solving the issue...p  pFinally, I had considered repurposing something like the homeregion qualifier of the ResourceContext to solve the issue however, that seems very limiting as there are already preestablished homeregions that I would have to choose from. Repurposing fields seems like a bad idea in general.p
Negative 2348 pIm writing a python spirograph program, and I need some help with converting part of it into a function. The code is attempting to reproduce the result illustrated in  the video I found a hrefhttpsyoutu.be1w2B4ZjZWyc relnofollowherea. One line rotates around the origin, and then another rotates off the end of that, etc.p  pWith a little bit of research into what I think is trigonometry, I put together a function coderotatepoint, angle, center0, 0code. The user inputs a point to be rotated, the angle clockwise that it is to be rotated by, and the centerpoint for it to be rotated around.p  pThen, I implemented an initial test, whereby one line rotates around the other. The end of the second line draws as if it were holding a pen. The codes a little messy, but it looks like this.p  precodex, y  0, 0 lines  []  while 1      point1  rotate0,50, x     point2  mapsum,ziprotate0, 50, y, point1     if x  0         oldpoint2  point2     else         canvas.createlineoldpoint2[0], oldpoint2[1], point2[0], point2[1]     lines.append canvas.createline0, 0, point1[0], point1[1]      lines.append canvas.createlinepoint1[0], point1[1], point2[0], point2[1]      oldpoint2  point2      tk.update      x  5     if x gt 360 and y gt 360         x  360         canvas.deleteall         time.sleep1     y  8.8     if y gt 360 y  360      for line in lines         canvas.deleteline     lines  [] codepre  pGreat, works perfectly. My ultimate goal is whats in the video, however. In the video, the user can input any arbitrary number of arms, then define the length and angular velocity for each arm. Mine only works with two arms. My question, ultimately, is how to put the code I posted into a function that looks like codedrawSpiralarms, lenlist, velocitylistcode. It would take the number of arms, a list of the velocities for each arm, and a list of the length of each arm as arguments. p  h2What Ive Triedh2  pIve already attempted this several times. Initially, I had something that didnt work at all. I got some cool shapes, but definitely not the desired output. Ive worked for a few hours, and the closest I could get was thisp  precodedef drawSpiralarms, lenlist, velocitylist     if not arms  lenlenlist  lenvelocitylist         raise ValueErrorThe lists dont match the provided number of arms      iteration  0     while 1          tk.update          iteration  1          Empty the list of points         pointlist  []         pointlist.append0, 0          Create a list of the final rotation degrees for each point         rotations  []         for vel in velocitylist             rotations.appendveliteration           for n in rangearms             point  tuplemapsum,ziprotate0, lenlist[n], rotations[n], pointlist[n]             pointlist.appendpoint          for point in pointlist             createpointpoint         for n in rangearms             print pointlist[n], pointlist[n1] codepre  pThis is fairly close to my solution, I feel, but not quite there. Calling codedrawSpiral2, [50, 75], [1, 5]code looks like it might be producing some of the right points, but not connecting the right sets. Staring at it for about an hour and trying a few things, I havent made any progress. Ive also gotten pretty confused looking at my own code. Im stuck The point rotating around the center is attached to a point that is just flying diagonally across the screen and back. The line attached to the center is stretching back and forth. Can someone point me in the right directionp  h2Results of further testsh2  pIve set up both functions to plot points at the ends of each arm, and found some interesting results. The first arm, in both cases, is rotating at a speed of 5, and the second at a speed of 3. The loop, outside of the function, is producing the pattern img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comErKsF.png altLoop39s resultp  pThe function, called with codedrawSpiral2, [50, 50], [5, 3]code, produces the result of img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKfutR.png altFunction39s resultp  pIt seems to be stretching the top half. With both arms having a velocity of 5, the function would be expected to produce two circles, one larger than the other. However, it produces an upsidedown cardioid shape, with the point connected to the center. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.como5SGj.png altenter image description here  p  pNow theres more evidence, can anyone who understands math more than me help mep
Negative 2348 pOK, so Ive asked about this before but now am further along in what Im trying to achieve, so can hopefully explain better.br I am supporting a FileMaker application which has been updated to allow users to export data in specific formats, five reports in total, and each one is correct in the data it produces.

Negative 2348 pI am writing a C application that takes embedded SQL files and executes them using FluentMigrator and I must find a way to strip my SQL of certain characters that cause FluentMigrator problems when it tries to execute. There are 3 ways of executing SQL through FM Execute a file by name, execute an embedded resource by name, and a string whose contents is valid SQL.p  pPreviously, I had tried to use the method of executing sql contained in a string, where I could strip out the bad characters before passing it to FM. Due to other constraints, I cannot go this route and must execute the SQL by giving the name of the embedded resource. The problem here is I cannot strip out the bad characters before execution by this method.p  pIs there a way to execute code that could remove the bad characters from my embedded resource files AT the time of buildcompilation. I know there are build events, but they seem to be limited to command line functions. Can I do morep  pEdit an example of these characters would be rn, nr and even a  alone on a line.p

Negative 2348 pIve got a data table works much quicker to handle all the records Ive got and I want to flag rows depending on a condition met by some rows for a group. Ill try to illustrate. My data looks like the followingp  precodeID  DATE    EVENT 1   01Jan97   A 1   01Jan97   K 2   03Jan03   A 3   04Jan03   K codepre  pSo there is an ID, a date and an event. The ultimate objective is to delete the rows that have EVENTA if there is already an EVENTK for the same date. So I thought about setting two flags, one if the group ID,DATE has A and other if they have K, so then, if it has both flags1, I would delete the row containing A cause I wouldnt need it. p  pSo, getting the first two flags its ok. This is how the code looks likep  precodemydata.table[EVENTK, k.flag1, by.ID, DATE]  codepre  pI do the same for the A.flag. Then I dont know exactly how to get a third flag to mark that if it has both then I can delete the record with A. So I want a table something likep  precodeID  DATE    EVENT   K.FLAG  A.FLAG  BOTH 1   01Jan97   A      0       1    1 1   01Jan97   K      1       0    1 2   03Jan03   A      0       1    0 3   04Jan03   K      1       0    0 codepre  pThen I would just delete for both1 and EVENTA. I know its not a very elegant solution but its the best one I can come up with but Im having problems with the statement for the third flag. Any suggestions I assume that it would be like having a CASE statement with the data.table, but I cant figure it out...p  pThank youp

The problem with this one is that I dont know if it will be able to rebuild it exactly the same as in canvas. And rebuilding the text labels would be a bunch of worktime and difficulty it has color, strike color, strike width, font size, opacity and the most important thing is that it uses Google Fonts which I dont know how could be used in PHP.p  pIm really counting on your opinions Thanksp

Negative 2348 pThere is an application server which prepares promotional messages HTTP messages with destination numbers and submits to APN apple push notification service for iOS or to GCM google cloud messaging server for android users. And then APN or GCM submits the messages to the subscribers mobile handsets in the form of ippush. Now mobile handsets will send 200 OK to the application server directly. But application server is a secured one with firewalls on and mobile handsets have dynamic ip addresses. In such scenario how application server will accept the 200 OK messages from unknown ip addresses. The firewalls cant be switch off. What can be done to achieve thisp
Negative 2348 pstrongThe Usecasestrongp  pI have an index of potentially millions of documents. I want to make around 200000 searches on a subset of these documents around 25000 documents. These 25000 documents could take up around 100 MB stored in Solr consisting of stored and indexes text fields.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pAs the number of indexed documents increases, the performance of the queries decreases a lot. For example running 20000 searches that hit 25000 documents on 100000 document index takes around 4 minutes. Running the same searches on 200000 document index takes around 20 minutes.p  pSo is there any way to cache these 25000 documents in RAM before hitting them with searchesp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pstrongSome things that really helpedstrongp  ul lipstrongreducing returned row countstrong In almost all cases I had to iterate through returned results and in almost all cases where were no more than 100 matching results, but I had set rows to a very large value. Reducing the row count improved the performance around 2x. This seemed counter intuitive. If there are only 79 matches and I set returned row count to 100 it performs better than in a case when where are 79 matches and I set the row count to 1000. In the first case Solr already returns found item count and does it fast. Why should there be a performance differencepli lipstrongreducing multithreadingstrong I had added multiple threads for querying because on the development box there were more resources available. On the resource constrained production box it was slowing things down. Using only one or two threads got me around 2x speed improvement.pli ul  pstrongSome things that did not really helpstrongp  ul lipstrongsplitting up field queriesstrong I was already using field queries everywhere it was possible, but I was combining them in one fq for each query codefqnamea AND typebcode.

Negative 2348 pRecently Ive been doing performance tests on Spark Streaming.

Why does not Spark Streaming  distribute data across the cluster and make full use of cluster Ive read official guide and it does not explain in detail, especially in Spark Streaming. Will it copy stream data to another node with free CPU and start new task on it when a task is on a node with busy CPU If so, how can we explain the former casep

This app should provide a full list of all museums, with a picture, description and a google map location on each one. And me being a total noob i dont know how to do that. Should i ListViews do load all the museums, and if so how to expand to show the picture and the google map Or is there a better, smarter way to do that   p

Negative 2348 pSo I am having issues with getting C interpreter errors   memory violation when running the script on most of our load generators. We have a couple server 20038gb ram load generators that the script runs fine on. However all of the windows 7 machines 4gb ram will not run the script. My first inclination is that its just running out of memory, however when I watch the resources on the 2003 server when its running it increases only 200mb of memory when I run the script. p  pWhat the script does It reads a file into memory, that buffer is then assigned to a LR parameter, that parameter is then assigned to an attachment of a MTOM SOAP request. When using small files 20mb and below I can run it in VUgen, larger files such as 85mb, I get Memory Access Violation. I then have to run it through performance center, using the 2003 Server Load Generator, which it runs and executes fine.p  pSince it runs on the machine with more memory I would have thought it was more due to memory available, yet when the script runs, not much is used on the 2003 server LG.p  pAny insight on this would be greatp  pCodep  precodedefine SEEKSET 0  beginning of file.  define SEEKCUR 1  current position.  define SEEKEND 2    end of file   int requestPrepared  0  char filename2  test.gz  setEXTERNALfile   long infile  file pointer  char buffer  buffer to read file contents into  Old Code  char filename  CEPDINDIVIDUALXMLEPDIndividual1.xml  file to read. old code.

Negative 2348 pI am currently building an Angular 1.x application using Firebase and AngularFire as my backendserver of choice.

Negative 2348 pI have a very strange problem.  I have a google form and an attached sheet.  That sheet has a script which seems to run OK I just have it doing a betterlogger on form submit.  Heres the strange thing  throughout the day I have been creating forms and scripts bound in sheets.  Now, for some reason, one form I have is running a script that is not bound to it well, it must be bound but I cannot see it when I edit the scripts.  No matter what I have tried, this sheet continues to run some mystery script of mine I can tell because it too has betterlogger output that gets merged with the correct script attached to the sheet.  To summarize, I have a script bound to a sheet that runs correctly but in parallel, another one of my sheet scripts runs at the same time  I have no way to tell which other script it is since I have many.  This mystery script runs  even if the sheet has NO triggers defined for the sheet script  p  pIs there any way to see all bound scripts for a sheet or form  Are there hidden ones that I can see or disconnect fromp

In InnoDBs default autoincrement locking mode, which a hrefhttpsdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1eninnodbautoincrementhandling.html relnofollowthe manuala calls consecutive, InnoDB skips an autoincrement value when a row might be inserted but is not, as is the case with codeINSERT IGNOREcode or codeON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATEcode that runs into an existing row whose codeUNIQUEcode values match those of the row being inserted. These are called mixedmode inserts in the manual.p  pEvery few hours, I import a feed from my supplier. This has about 200,000 rows, and all but on average 200 of these rows have unique values that correspond to values already present in the table. So if I were to use codeINSERT IGNOREcode or codeON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATEcode all the time, Id burn through 199,800 IDs every few hours. So I dont want to use codeINSERT IGNOREcode or codeON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATEcode for fear that I might exhaust the 4.2 billion limit of codeINTEGER UNSIGNEDcode with repeated inserts over time to a table with the same codeUNIQUEcode key. I dont want to switch the column to codeBIGINTcode type because 32bit PHP has no type with the same semantics as MySQL codeBIGINTcode. The server administrator is unwilling to switch to 64bit PHP or to change codeinnodbautoinclockmodecode for all users of the server.p  pSo instead, I decided to try codeINSERT INTO ...

Negative 2348 pI am trying to dig a bit deeper into memory allocation, addressing and I also run into the concept of stack alignment, and in general, memory alignment. I would like to understand if I got correctly all the concepts. My questions are all referred to nowdays computers and processors such as the one we have on our laptops. I wish to underline that I read lots of other questions on stackoverflow, and most of my actual knowledge come from them. p  pMy first doubts were related to the concept of memory word. The memory word define not only the registers and bus size, but also the basic memory unit e.g., 64 bit on 64bit arch, 32 bit on 32bit arch ecc. However, as far as I know, each address references exactly strong1 bytestrong of memory, regardless of the size of a memory word. So we might say that each byte has its own address. Butp  pstrong1strong Is it correct that the CPU is not able to access a single byte but it access the entire word in which that byte is contained Thus, if a specific byte is request for example, I access a the direct address of a emcharem, it access the entire word and makes some calculations to remove the other portion and return the exact bytep  pstrong2strong Is it then correct that the CPU can practically access ONLY memory word unit and that each memory word starts from a even address, multiple of the unit itselfp  pSo, for example, on a 64bit architecture the memory word are 8 bytes thus the example address 0x2710 10000 in base 10 would be the start of a memory word. If I try to access 0x2711 the CPU will access from 0x2710 to 0x2717 and then extract only the single byte. Correctp  pSecond. As, I said before, I run into the memory alignment. At start It created me some confusion. Please, help me to understand if I got it right. The problem essentially is related to performance or, in some cases, to SSE specific instructions that need 16bytes alignment. In the first case, for example, If on a 64bit arch a 8 bytes data e.g., a long int is stored across 2 memory words, the CPU needs 2 access instead of one. p  pstrong3strong So, take the following examplep  precode0x2710  ....  0x2711  ....  0x2712  ....  0x2713  ....  0x2714  data  0x2715  data  0x2716  data  0x2717  data  0x2718  data  0x2719  data  0x2720  data  0x2721  data  0x2722  ....  0x2723  ....  0x2724  ....  0x2725  ....  codepre  pIn this case memory is not aligned. Correct With alignment, CPU would have stored data only from 0x2710 or, if occupied until 0x2713, it would have inserted padding and then stored the 8bytes data from 0x2718. Rightp  pstrong4strong Thus, memory alignment essentially consists in storying multibyte data only starting from address which are multiple of the desired bytes unit usually, the memory word itself but also other custom units  e.g., using mpreferredstackboundaries on GCC. I said multibyte data because if the data is only onebyte it will always fit inside only a single word. Is all this correctp  pstrong5strong Memory alignment is applied by the compiler Thus, is it applied in the binary assembly code or it is applied in some way by the CPU when storing data And, isnt it a big waste of memory I mean, if it is always applied each multibyte data may imply also a padding I can be an enormous waste of memory spacep  pThats all Thanks, really thanks in advance p

Negative 2348 pI am attempting to write an algorithm that will determine the likelihood that a party will bid on an auction given past behavior, available capital, how much they have need, etc.  I will be writing a shell that runs the algorithm and returns the result.p  pWhat algorithm would be best for solving this  Also, what scripting language would accomplish this in the best wayp  pI am very new to creating using algorithms so any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 2348 pOn github I dont see an option for read timeout, a hrefhttpsgithub.comNodeRedisnoderedis relnofollowhttpsgithub.comNodeRedisnoderedisap  pTheres codeconnecttimeoutcode, but thats for making the connection, not about readingwriting tho.p
Negative 2348 pI have an codearraycode of codeNSDatecode objects that Im trying to convert to a codestringcode. My way of converting them is with codeNSDateFormatcode, but, if theres another better way, Id be happy to hear.p  pThe most things a codedatecode would have isp  precodeDaysHoursMinutesSecondsMilliseconds codepre  pBut some will have less, likep  precodeMinutesSecondsMilliseconds codepre  pOr even less. Now I will have to convert them to a codestringcode. Would I have to create codeif statementscode to determine if it has days, hours, and so on, or is there an easier way of doing thisp
Negative 2348 pI have started to learn web sockets. It is must learn technology in todays time. But i am curious to learn more about it. My basic question is How many WebSocket connection can be created on Client Side.p  pMy Typically Application is html UI based and on the server i have rest based services. I need to track whether p  ol liSession timeout has happed or not li liWhether Connection to the server is lost or not  A kind of pooling program to check with connections is alive or not.li ol  pSo I am creating 2 websocket objects on client and different url for them.p  pI hope i have implemented it correctly  p

Negative 2348 pI am running a simple cc code on a Raspberry Pi 2 with Raspbian kernel version 4.1.6v7 in order to view the thermal images from my new FLIR Lepton camera. I also want to see the actual temperature of the object I am pointing it at, but as the temperature is expressed as relative to the internal temperature of the camera, I need to call a function     leptontemperature which requires     i2cdev module to be activated. When I activate it and run the function the program slows down from around 9fps to around two frames strongper minutestrong. I didnt really modify anything in the provided code, so I dont understand why that is happening. Heres the functionp  precodeint leptontemperature  ifconnected        leptonconnect  result  LEPGetSysFpaTemperatureKelvinampport, ampfpatempkelvin return  fpatempkelvin  codepre  pWithout i2cdev turned on the program works normally, but of course then I am getting a zero instead the temperature value. Anyone maybe has an idea on what is going on and how to solve itmake it fasterp
