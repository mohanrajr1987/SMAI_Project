Positive 79102 pI am using Parse as the backend for an app Im working on. I was wondering if there is an optimal algorithm to query for only unseen new objects. p  pWhat I am planning on doing is something like adding a user to the viewed objects relation and later querying all objects to check for the absence of the user. This seems to be On all users who have seen an n complexity which is a bit too much.p  pAnother way to do this is to add the object to a users key seen and to then query for all objects the user has not seen. p  pMaybe a much more efficient way could be assuming I view these objects chronologically is to mark the first and last objects I see, and only show ones before or after those points using the createdAt key. Then I guess to show new objects outward from those points to not have to divide into multiple queries.p  pIdeally Id like to shuffle through the objects, but I also would like to keep this algorithm as efficient as possible.p

Positive 79102 pIm working on an app that should be hidden behind login view. p  pSo in general, I have a tab navigation controller which should hold pretty much the entire app and my logic is when the app loads, the initial View controller is the tab navigation controller, which shows its first View IF the user is logged in. If its not logged in, they should see loginregister page. Both login and register page work with Parse, they are ok and function well. They are presented Modally using segues on top of the first View in the Tab view controller. p  pThe issue is that when I login and I confirm that it works the login View controller is not dismissed in order to see the tab view controller and I think that I might have messed something up in the segues. The segue to present the login view if the user is not logged in is made from the protected view not its navigation controller, although i tested that too, doesnt work to login view controller. p  pAlso, the code in the protected page is like this p  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      self.performSegueWithIdentifiersegueToLoginView, sender self  codepre  pHeres what my story board looks likep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comd7qLY.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd7qLY.png altenter image description hereap  pSo, the login segue is presented modally and heres my code for the login button.p  precodeIBAction func loginButtonTappedsender AnyObject       let username  usernameTextField.text     let password  passwordTextField.text        Sends to Parse to see if user exists     PFUser.logInWithUsernameInBackgroundusername, password password          user PFUser, error NSError gt Void in          if user  nil                LOGIN Successful             NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.setBooltrue, forKey isUserLoggedIn             NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.synchronize             self.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nil             printUser logged in           else                Display Failed Login Alert message with confirmation             let failedLoginAttepmt  UIAlertController                 title Ups,                 message Something went wrong, try again...,                 preferredStyle UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert                          let confirmAction  UIAlertAction                 title OK,                 style UIAlertActionStyle.Default                  action in                     self.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nil                               failedLoginAttepmt.addActionconfirmAction             self.presentViewControllerfailedLoginAttepmt, animated true, completion nil              printCould not find the user          codepre  pand this line of code codeself.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nilcode should dismiss the modally presented login view controller, as I do see the print statement in the console. p  pWheres my mistakep

Positive 79102 pI am trying to restart an activity using the users button push that is stored in a global variable.  Let me explain....p  pThe user makes a choice from a listView in the MainActivity.  That goes to the Template screen and is populated from a query from a Parse database.  That part works perfectly....the first time.  p  pFurther in the code of the Template activity there is a method named Intents that sets a global variable depending the users choice button push to be used later.  It also has the intent to restart the same activity.  That works fine also.  So far, so good.  p  pOnce the activity starts over none of the populate method data shows on the screen and I get an error of no results found for query and I dont understand why.  This only happens when the user pushes the button on the first Template screen to open the second Template screen.  The add button, close button and edit text area all function properly.  Its just the populate data that is not being retrieved and its only with the second call to the database.p  pI have verified the data is in the lds. The problem is not with accessing the second Template activity.  The problem is in the query to the database the second time. It returns nothing and does not place any buttons or the text box on the screen either. What am I missing  p  pI have tried query.whereExists, query.whereEqualTo and query.whereContains and even combinations of these.

Positive 79102 pRecently, I have been hitting Parse rate limit every time my servers try to upload data to Parse. What is not clear to me is why.p  pI use batch inserts, batch updates and batch deletes. I even throttle the batch operations themselves 0.25 seconds between operations yet I still get this in my logsp  precode10032015 040517 AM loading to Parse 10032015 040550 AM Inserted 851 10032015 040550 AM Updated ucode 155, uerror uThis application performed 1802 requests within the past minute, and exceeded its request limit. Please retry in one  minute or raise your request limit. codepre  pWhat I am not clear about is whether a batch still counts as individual operation or does Parse look at it as 50 inserts for example. If it does then whats the point If it does not treat a batch as individual operations then how can 1802 requests broken down to batches of 50 in 0.25 secs bursts hit this limitp  pAnd before you ask, no app tester is even trying to pull the data as they were all asleepp  pI followedread various links including a hrefhttpsparse.complansfaq relnofollowthisa one and a hrefhttpswww.parse.comquestions30requestspersecondequatestohowmanyconcurrentusers relnofollowthisa one but am still puzzled.p  pAny advice will be appreciated. p  pThanksp

Negative 79102 pIm looking for an algorithm that will count the number of binary bit patterns in an codenbitcode word which are equal to or less than an arbitrary limit that is less than code2ncode. Further, I want to generate the count for all code1bitcode combinations, code2bitcode combinations, etc. Obviously, if the limit were code2ncode, there would be code2ncode combinations codeCn,1 1bit combinations plus Cn,2 2bit plus Cn,3 3bit and so oncode. If a limit were imposed, however, not every one of those possible combinations would be valid less than the imposed limit.p  pFor example, say coden4code. There are 16 possible bit patterns, 15 of which contain 1 or more code1bitscode. If a limit of 10 were imposed, those patterns greater than 10 would not be included in the count. So, for single bit patterns, the valid ones would be code0001code, code0010code, code0100code, and code1000code. Twobit patterns would be code0011code, code0101code, code0110code, code1001code. Patterns code1010code and code1100code would not be counted because they exceed 10. The only 3bit bit would be code0111code while the sole 4bit pattern, code1111code, is over the limit.p  pIf codeFcode is my counting function, codeF4,10,1code would return 4, the number of code4bitcode patterns of 1 bit that are less than 10. codeF4,10,2code would return 4 where as codeC4,2code is 6. Because the actual value of codencode can be large 40 or bits, enumerating the possible patterns, testing against the limit, and counting valid ones is impractical.p  pAny ideas as to how this might be done efficientlyp

Negative 79102 pIm using a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgXtext relnofollowXtexta to define my DSL. Xtext generates a parser that lets me traverse the EMF model of my input DSL.

Negative 79102 pAfter a thousand of attempts to Googlebypass that using pointers, I decided myself to post this question to you guys.p  pHeres the problem Im trying to create a minimum spanning tree from a graph that I previously made. Im using Kruscals Algorithm for that, which is about checking every arc from the shorter to the longest and taking vertexes that I miss.p  pTo do that, I implemented my graph using a stlmap as an adjaciences matrix. The map is made of the following pair double distance, pairVertex, Vertex . p  pThe algorithm requires you to distinguish between a pair you havent entirely, and one of which you need only one vertex the former needs you to create another set and you have to gradually connect all of those sets by getting the arcs that connect them those arcs being of course those having 1 vertex in a set and 1 vertex in another one.p  pI decided to implement Kruscal this way my MST min spanning tree is a stlmap itself, and so every subset is. They are organized in a list of maps which I typedefd mapt every time I get a node of which I miss 2 vertexes, one tree is added to the list and that node is put into it. The connections will make my MST come into the first node of the list.p  pCode seems ok to me, but theres no way that list iterators are happy with that.

This works fine as expected.  p  pI have also created a page using Microsoft Office Sharepoint Designer and using a DataFormWebPart I have created a page that shows all the items in the list in a list view,  I have also changed the XSL node of the  DFWP to display the datain a way that my client wants.  p  pThe issue that I have is, it is only showing the latest version of the item record e.g. some of the fields are blank as the client did not update those fields the last time that the item was saved.  I can fully understand why it is not showing these previous versions of the item but is there anyway that I can change an option in the webpart that will return that last non blank version of the fieldp  pIf this is not possible does anybody know if it is possible to change the edit page for the item so that it defaults certain fields to have the previous value of the field.p  pMany thanks for you ideas in advancep  pJonathanp

Negative 79102 pI am currently busy refactoring big parts in my application.  The main purpose is to remove as much as possible dependencies between the different modules.  I now stumble on the following problemp  pIn my application I have a GUI module that has defined an interface IDataProvider.  The interface needs to be implemented by the application and is used to provide data to the GUI module.  E.g. a data grid can be given this IDataProvider and use it to loop over all the instances that should be shown in the data grid, and getting their data.p  pNow have another module in fact quite some more modules that all need something similar like a reporting module, a database integration module, a mathematical solver module, ....  At this moment I can see 2 things I can dop  ul liI could move IDataProvider from the GUI layer to a much lowerlevel layer and reuse this same interface in all the other modules. ul liThis has the advantage that it becomes easier for the application to use all the modules it only has to implement a data provider once.li liThe disadvantage is that I introduce a dependency between the modules and the central IDataProvider.  If someone starts to extend IDataProvider with additional methods needed for one module, it also starts to pollute the other modules.li ulli liThe other alternative is to give every module its own data provider, and force the application to implement all of them if it wants to use all the modules. ul liThe advantage is that the modules are not dependent on a common partli liThe disadvantage is that I end up with IGridDataProvider, IReportDataProvider, IDatabaseDataProvider, ISolverDataProvider.li ulli ul  pWhats the best approach to use  Is it acceptible to make all modules dependent on the same common interface if they require [almost or completely] the same kind of interfacep  pIf I use the same IDataProvider interface, can this give nasty problems in the future which I am not aware of at this momentp

Negative 79102 pSo I have a table thats basically a tree. Each row has a parent in the same table, and a lvl column that tells me the level in the tree, the root being lvl  0. Now say I want to select all the rows that have a name starting with A, but only those that are on the highest level in this group. So the tree might have 9 levels, but the highest level containing a row with name starting with A might be on level 7, so I want all rows on level 7 starting with A ignoring those on lower levels. I could do something like thisp  precodeselect id, name, lvl   from mytable  where name like A    and lvl  select maxlvl from mytable                where name like A codepre  pThe problem with this is that I want to do something more complex than getting the rows starting with A, so the condition would be something with a bit more clauses, and the select and subselect will have a few joins as well, and I dont like to repeat myself. Especially since I may need to modify this in the future, and Im afraid I may forget some clause in one of the selects.p  pSo is there an easier way of doing this, without having to repeat the select, to get the maximum level.p

Negative 79102 pWhen you create a Clojure project with leiningen all the .cljfiles are compiled AOT. Normally the AOT compilation is not necessary and I would like to minimize it.p  pThis is necessary for me to raise acceptance of Clojure as a complement in a Javadominated environment.

Negative 79102 pAh, Im getting a warning saying my question appears subjective and is likely to be closed. But I think its a pertinent and important question about architectural design.p  pAll my programming years I have been told that SQL statements being created and executed directly within UI code for example an ASP.NET page codebehind are a massive code smell and that data access and presentation concerns should be at opposite ends of the applications layers.p  pNowadays I have a shiny data access layer using NHibernate entities via the Repository pattern. And Im finding myself writing Linq queries directly in my UI codep  pPart of me thinks this is the same as writing SQL queries in UI code, but just dressed up in smarter clothes.p  pThe other part of me says that the Linq queries are the tip of a sophisticated abstraction layer separating the UI code from the internals of the database, and that if I didnt use Linq queries in the page then I would have to add oneoff report methods to my Repository like codeGetAllFoosWithRedNosesAndSleighBellscode, which I also think of as an antipattern.p  pWhat do you think Ill give the answer to whoever makes the strongest argument in my subjective view, as are all answers on Stack Overflow.p

Negative 79102 pI have a local database MySQL 5.1 at Ubuntu 10.10 with some 15000 tables each with 1 000 000 rows on average. Each table has 6 DOUBLE columns. The storage engine is MyISAM. I have a C application that loads the data one table at a time and performs some calculations. The way I retrieve the data from the database is simply by SELECT  FROM table ORDER BY timestamp timestamp is the first column DOUBLE marked as UNIQUE By far most of the time is spent in loading and fetching. It takes 15s to load and fetch all the rows in one table tried with the native C API, C Connector and MySQL Query Browser. When I load the same dataset from disk plain text file using fstream the same operation takes only 4s.p  pIs it possible for MySQL or any other database SQLite to get anywhere near this value Although, I have mostly simple SELECTS and INSERTS  one simple JOIN I like the idea of database because it is somewhat easier to manage large data sets, so I would stick with it even at cost of some performance loss, but 154s per table is way too much given the number of tables.

Negative 79102 pI need to implement an application that streams data from disk.

Negative 79102 pFor Code First CTP 3 and 4 I had a generic repository pattern implemented by implementing a method in my codeDbContextcode that had codereturn this.ObjectContext.CreateObjectSetltTgtcode.  This allowed me to create an object set for any type I needed, which I can then use Linq to code against.  p  pLast night I upgraded to CTP5 and it seems like they have changed a lot of how codeDbContextcode was implemented.  One aspect is there is no longer an codeObjectContextcode property in the codeDbContextcode class.  As far as I can tell, there is no method to create an codeObjectSetltTgtcode or any other dataset that I can use to access on demand generically that will be tied to the data context.p  pI then had the idea to create a codeDbSetltTgtcode in the method instead, as that could allow me to perform linqtoentities operations on it.  This doesnt work either though, as there are no constructors for codeDbSetltTgtcode or so the compiler tells me and I have no way to tie it to the existing instance of my data context.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how to implement a generic repository with Code First CTP5p

Negative 79102 pstrongtldr versionstrong I need a sexy session and authentication handler for a publicly accessible, internal company tool. Should I create my own or is there an existing tool everyone finds dreamyp  pHere are my specificsp  pstrongAuthenticationstrong Ive spent the past few weeks studying up on the dangers of user security in PHP and it seems the further down the rabbit hole you dive, the more there is to learn. I feel confident that I can write a system that rotates sessions on every request, can prevent XSS and XSRF, and generally protect my backend fairly well. Im hesitant to look into existing tools simply because its easier to trust and blame yourself than someone else.p  pstrongSession Handlingstrong The more I looked into security, the more pragmatic it seemed that its smarter to use session handling inside a database instead of native to PHP. That way, you can build and monitor ACLs easier, clustering, etc.p  pMy concern with a database structure is that if there are a few hundred people hammering on this database at a time altering their sessionids every page call, I could run into some performance issues at scale.p  pOriginally I was planning on creating my own classes for this in PHP and use MySQL as the backend. Now Im worried that MySQL would have concurrency issues. Ive looked into NoSQL like MongoDB, but then I paralyze myself thinking that I may be OVERTHINKING the whole damn thing. Then after the brain freeze pain is over, I start to think someone has to have already done this and I guarantee theyve thought of everything Im too stupid to consider.p  pIm hoping there are greater minds out there that have encountered the same questions I am facing and have some advice for me. Is there something out there that you would trust for this type of purpose or should I continue down the path of writing my own and if so which tools do you think are the best option for such a taskp  pIf you made it this far, thank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the community on thisp

Negative 79102 pI am writing an application that is consuming an inhouse WCFbased REST service and Ill admit to being a REST newbie.  Since I cant use the Add Service Reference, I dont have readymade proxy objects representing the return types from the service methods.  So far the only way Ive been able to work with the service is by sharing the assembly containing the data types exposed by the service.p  pMy problem with this arrangment is that I see only two possibilitiesp  ol lipImplement DTOs DataContracts and expose those types from my service. I would still have to share an assembly but this approach would limit the types contained in the assembly to the service contract and DTOs.  I dont like to use DTOs just for the sake of using them, though as they add another layer of abstraction and processing time to convert from domain object to DTO and vice versa.  Plus, if I want to have business rules, validation, etc. on the client, Id have to share the domain objects anyways, so is the added complexity necessary.pli lipSupport serialization of my domain objects, expose those types and share that assembly.  This would allow me to share business and validation logic with the client but it also exposes parts of my domain objects to the client that are meant only for the service app.pli ol  pPerhaps an example would help the discussion...p  ul lipMy client application will display a list of documents that is obtained from the REST service a GET operation. The service returns an array of DocumentInfo objects lightweight, readonly representation of a Document.pli lipWhen the user selects one of the items, the client retrieves the full Document object from the REST service GET by id and displays a data entry form so the user can modify the object.  We would want validation rules for a rich user experience.pli lipWhen the user commits the changes, the Document object is submitted to the REST service a PUT operation where it is persisted to the backend data store.pli lipIf the state of the Document allows, the user may Publish the Document. In this case, the client POSTs a request to the REST service with the Document.ID value and the service performs the operation by retrieving the serverside Document domain object and calling the Publish method.  The Publish method should not be available to the client application.pli ul  pAs I see it, my Document and DocumentInfo objects would have to be in a shared assembly.  Doing this makes Document.Publish available to the client.  One idea to hide it would be to make the method internal and add an InternalsVisibleTo attribute that allows my service app to call the method and not the client but this seems smelly.p  pAm I on the right track or completely missing somethingp

Negative 79102 pI have a coworker that is against type inference in C. I believe most of his arguments surrounded lack of readability. My argument against that is that Visual Studios intellisense features provide a simple way of viewing types, and reading them from the code isnt as necessary as it might be if we were coding out of notepad.p  pHowever, I am curious about the advantages and disadvantages of using type inference in C. I come from C and I know that C0xs auto has a more objective benefit in that you dont always know the types youre getting especially when doing heavy template programming. An example is using auto to store the value of Boost.Bind.p  pIn C, type inference doesnt seem to be as much of a requirement so much as it is a nice to have or sugarcoating feature. I think it would be useful for when you are dealing with long types, e.g.p  precodeLazyltListltMyNamespace.ISomeVeryLongInterfaceTypegtgt myVar  obj.GetLazy codepre  pit would bep  precodevar myVar  obj.GetLazy codepre  pThis is much cleaner in my opinion. However, are there any objective arguments for OR against type inference Is it good programming practice to use it, even in situations where it is arguable that it provides no benefit e.g., using var instead of intp  pSome help in understanding how I should use var in my daytoday coding would be great.p

Is this a normal hasmany relationship Ive been reading a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.html relnofollowhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.htmla and it seems like it could also be a hasandbelongstomany.pli lipEach Version has many Reviews, therefore Version hasmany Reviews and Review belongsto Version.pli lipAdditionally, I guess Review should have some reviewerid kind if field so we know who wrote it. This should be a Review hasone Reviewer.pli ul  pAs an aside, I dont want to be too needy, but it would be absolutely fantastic if someone could provide some insight into the few lines of Reviewer controller code necessary for an admin to assign himher to a Submission.p  pCheers,p

Negative 79102 pI have data that I want to create a GIS type application that will have the typical features of adding and removing layers of different types. What is the best architectural approachp  pThe data consists of property locations in Eastings and Northings. I also have ordnance survey data in GML and Shapefiles.p  pI know this is a very broad question but the subject area also seems very broad to me and I am unsure which direction to go.p  pI was thinking of using SQL 2008 spatial and Bing Silverlight control to visualise that maps.To do this would I have to convert the eastings and northings to GWS84 geography datatype But then if I converted the shapefiles to GML and imported all the GML files to sql  using GeomFromGML they would be in geometry datatypes. Wouldnt the two types be incompatiblep  pAlso, should ESRI ArcGIS API for Silverlight feature in the equation Is this a good environment to create maps that I can point as SQL sqerver 2008 as the datasource using a WCF service if necessaryp  pAny advice greatly appreciatedp

Negative 79102 pWere creating an object hierarchy where each item has a collection of other items, and each item also has a codeParentcode property pointing to its parent item. Pretty standard stuff.  We also have an codeItemsCollectioncode class that inherits from codeCollectionltItemgtcode which itself has an codeOwnercode property pointing to the item the collection belongs to.  Again, nothing interesting there.p  pWhen an item is added to the codeItemsCollectioncode class, we want it to automatically set the parent of Item using the collections codeOwnercode property and when the item is removed, we want to clear the parent.p  pHeres the thing.  We only want the codeParentcode setter to be available to codeItemsCollectioncode, nothing else.  That way not only can we know who the parent of an item is, but we can also ensure an item isnt added to multiple collections by checking for an existing value in codeParentcode, or letting someone arbitrarily change it to something else.p  pThe two ways we know how to do this arep  ol lipMark the setter as private, then enclose the collection definition within the scope of the item itself.

Negative 79102 pIm trying to create a filter.  I have a function that returns an NSArray for the different categories I can have.  Id like one extra option for All to denote that no filter is being applied.  For example, should displayp  precodeAll Soda Wine Beer codepre  pI started with this, but I dont think its very good implementation at all, and its not correct either.  Its just where Im at so farp  precode voidinitCategoryDictionary      NSMutableArray conditionCategories  NSMutableArray [self GetAllCategories]      [conditionCategories insertObjectAll atIndex0]     no filter case at first index     NSMutableArray objectValues  [NSMutableArray array]     [objectValues addObject[NSNumber numberWithBoolYES]]  this is for the no filter case at the first index     for int i  0 i lt [conditionCategories count] i          [objectValues addObject[NSNumber numberWithBoolNO]]          self.CategoryDictionary  [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsobjectValues forKeysconditionCategories]   codepre  pOn the first line of the method, I dont know if I should be typecasting this or not.  My categories currently does not have an All category, so this is the way I could figure out to add All to the NSArray before inserting it into the dictionary.  p  pI thought I could then add an array of YES, NO, NO, .... NO for all the other items in the dictionary.  This way, my dictionary would default to All being true no filter applied.  Then based on what is selected, I would change the All to NO, and the other values selected to YES and filter appropriately.  The for loop is wrong since it only gives me an array of 2 objects with 0 and 1 as my values.  p  pSo this is what I thought I would do, but obviously this isnt a good or correct way to do things.  Any thoughts  Thanksp

Negative 79102 pIve managed to install RMySQL in R, and it runs fine I also installed its required dependency, DBI, and it works fine too. Im building a java application that interacts with R through the JRI package which also works fine. Currently my application queries a MySQL database, writes the query results to file, and loads these files in R by using the load.csv function in R. However, the program would run more efficiently if R were to interact directly with MySQL hence the RMySQL package.  The problem that Im having is that the RMySQL package will not load in R if I try to load it by using the Rengine.eval JRI function. However, the Rengine.eval function will load any other library that Ive tried loading. Heres a snippet of the codep  precodeRengine re  re.evallibraryDBI  this works, DBI will load re.evallibraryRMySQL  this will not work, RMySQL fails to load codepre  pTo verify that RMySQL is failing to load I did thisp  precodeREXP x System.out.printlnxre.evallibraryDBI System.out.printlnxre.evallibraryRMySQL codepre  pI get the following outputp  p[STRING DBI, stats, graphics, grDevices, utils, datasets, methods, base]p  pnullp  pAs can be clearly seen, the second println command is returning a null which means that the RMySQL is failing to load and of course none of the RMySQL functions work either. I have no idea why this is the case.p  pI dont know what it is Im doing wrong, but if someone can tell me what the problem is, or if there is a better way of loading libraries through JRI I would much appreciate it.p  pNote that I am using R version 2.13.0 on sparcsunsolaris2.10, and the RMySQL0.80 build.p

Negative 79102 pIm getting a System.DllNotFoundException for a .dll which is in the same folder as the executable whenever my application attempts to use a function which exists in the DLL. The weird thing is that it is only occurring on one users PC it works fine on my dev PC and it works fine on one nondev PC that I tried it on. Also, there are other DLLs in the folder which emareem being found and used correctly. The DLL in question is a native library which is referenced by my application via another DLL which is a c wrapper for the native library. p  pMy initial instinct is that there must be some other library being referenced by this DLL which doesnt exist on the problematic PC, but I cannot imagine what library this PC could be missing that the other nondev PC has.p  pSo my questions are this is there a way to determine the dependencies of a given DLL file Keep in mind that the DLL in question is a native library i.e. not managed code, and I do not have access to its source code.

Negative 79102 pIm in the early phases of working on a web application, and Ive reached a point where I want to make the best choice about a particular security concern. At the moment, all fields found within HTML forms are named after the database column that they are representing. So, for example, if in the database I have a field named email, then the form field will be called email as well. This makes it easier for my generic code to handle forms, but I naturally see one major problem with such names strongThey can give potential hackers insight into how my database is structured, just from viewing the source.strongp  pThe main solution Ive thought of involves encrypting field names so that client never has the real ones. A serverside key would be used to do the encryption. I am, however, concerned that this approach may complicate things too much. For examplep  ul liI may find myself having to use POSTs more often, as the encrypted text might be longer than the original  pushing the limits of GET when many fields and their data are present.li liFrequent encryptdecrypt calls might lead to performance issues down the line. I did not test this yet, so it could end up being negligible.li liNonAJAX GETs cant use this approach without looking really cryptic.li ul  pSo, Im wondering what you guys think about this. Am I overthinking it, or am I on the right track Is there a better way to handle it p  pBy the way, Im also aware that a field name like email doesnt offer much information to the developer why not txtEmail, or something like that. Im looking to see if theres a good naming convention that I can adopt, as it might help with the above problem.p

Negative 79102 pTaking an example to clarify, say I have a program that takes in two inputs from the user, a and b. The program increments a and decrements b. The program returns the value at which a and b both become equal. Hence, a has to be smaller and b has to be larger. But what if the user enters the opposite a as larger and b as smaller The program would go into an infinite loop obviously. But suppose I want the program to return that these two numbers can never meet. Then how do I check for it Please dont answer that check for the numbers and respond respectively. This is just an example. I want to know how to check for a condition that can never be met.p  pAnother example, say comparing two numbers. Suppose I have two numbers and I keep randomising them. The program should return true when they are equal and false when they are not. It should not go into an infinite loop when the numbers are not equal. I can only keep comparing the numbers in each iteration and return true as soon as they are equal. But there are likely chances that they never become equal and the program never terminates. How to check for such a scenario and return something like the numbers can never be equal.p

How do achieve thisp  pFor examplep  ol liOn browser using JavaScript I have designed a tree widget that I use for displaying comments in tree structure.li liSay user clicks on comments button.li liMy UI widget will fire an AJAX to get data for comments.li liThis request is intercepted by STRUTS 2 framework. li liIt will call, say, codegetCommentscode action API and will populate an arrayList with comment object say cmt.li liNow the response is handled by a velocity template.vm.li lipNow in vm I am writing code like thisp  precode CommentsData  [      setsep     foreachc in cmt     sep              commentText  c.getText          setsep,     end   codepreli lipNow the final response may turn out like thisp  precode CommentsData  [               commentText  This is comment 1     ,              commentText  This is comment 2     ,              commentText  This is comment 3     ,              commentText  This is comment 4           ]  codepreli lipNow this may look like JSON, but its not strict JSON I mean if I miss some code,code somewhere then on client side in JavaScript my emevalem might fail or codeJSON.parsecode will fail, but on velocity template I have now clue if JSON is malformed.pli lipSo once the above velocity template is generated I need some control, where I can write some Java code to do some validations on the response.pli ol  pI see that my approach to use velocity template to generate JSON output actully a String that looks like JSON may be wrong. But still I need to handle the response of every velocity template I have written.p

Negative 79102 pI have been trying for the last week to find a way to make JFreeChart display something similar to the image below. Basically you are looking at three series upper, middle, lower with a fill inbetween. And underneath there is a light green fill color, or an area chart as some would perhaps call it  no meaning, just for looks.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCaI4Y.png altenter image description herep  pThe only thing really missing from what I have come up with is the last part the fill underneath  area chartp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaBMJZ.png altenter image description herep  pI even tried to subclass XYDifferenceRenderer and combine it with the renderer for Areachart, but I could not control the height of the areachart, basically filling up the plot to the top. So that was a nogo. Having created as simple rendererer to create rounded bar charts earlier, I thought that I might be able to change the code for XYDifferenceRenderer. But the code for XYDifferenceRenderer is quite a handful of geometry and inner workings of JFree chart, and the task was a bit overwhelming. So any tips on how to achieve this effect in any normal way that does not involve hacking JFreeCharts inner workingsp

Negative 79102 pI am developing a C application which needs floatingpoint determinism.  I would also like the floatingpoint operations to be fairly fast.  This includes standard transcendental functions not specified by IEEE754 like sine and logarithm.  The software floatingpoint implementations I have considered are relatively slow, compared to hardware floating point, so I am considering simply rounding away one or two of the least significant bits from each each answer.  The loss of precision is an adequate compromise for my application, but will this suffice to ensure deterministic results across platforms  All floatingpoint values will be doubles.p  pI realize order of operations is another potential source for variance in floatingpoint results.  I have a way to address that already.  p  pIt would be terrific if there were software implementations of the major floatingpoint hardware implementations in use today, so I could test a hypothesis like this directly.p

Negative 79102 pI know it is not recommend to use Sqlite over a network drive, for two reasons performance, and data corruption due to bad implementation of network file systems.p  pStill, Id like to explore the possibility of using Sqlite to support a multiuser application with a central database.  We already support Sqlite on a singleuser machine and several database servers Oracle, PostgreSQL for multiuser setups.  Using Sqlite for multiuser setup would be convenient to allow lightweight installations on existing IT infrastructures with Windows shared drives SMB.p  pWe dont care too much about performance, so we are ready to pay the price needed to avoid corruption. Quoting a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgatomiccommit.htmlhttpwww.sqlite.orgatomiccommit.htmla, section 9.1p  blockquote   pBut if you must use a network filesystem to store SQLite database   files, consider using a secondary locking mechanism to prevent   simultaneous writes to the same database even if the native filesystem   locking mechanism malfunctions.p blockquote  pIm looking on hints and advices to implement such a mechanism, or, more generally, on tips to avoid problems with Sqlite over a Windows shared drive.p  pFor instance, Im considering the following braindead approach to locking before any non readonly SQLite query, try to create an empty file on the same shared folder and keep it open until the end of the query normally, any other Windows process trying to create a file with the same name while its still open would block or fail. Would that work  Anything betterp

Negative 79102 pIn Jenkins or Hudson, I set up a pipeline of parameterized jobs, say A  B, that copy artifacts from each other using the Copy Artifact Plugin. All jobs use the same parameter, e.g. the target platform. Each job is set to discard old builds and artifacts to limit disk usage, keeping only the latest stable build artifacts. I use parameterized builds to avoid having to maintain many jobs that only differ in the parameter setting.p  pThis setup only works if all builds run after each other in a pipeline with the same parameter settings, and hence the latest build artifacts match the platform parameter setting of a dependent job. Now if someone first builds job A for platform x, and then for platform y, then builds B for platform x, the artifacts from A for platform x are already discarded and hence B cannot copy these.p  pIs there a way to tell Jenkins to keep the latest artifacts for each build with different parameters and discard all othersp

Negative 79102 pI have a FEZ Board I dont think this matters and Im communicating with it through a serial port. I made a WPF application, where I open the COM port and write data over it. This all works great, but after sending data a random amount of times sometimes 3, sometimes 4 I get an exception saying A device attached to the system is not functioning on the Write method of the port, when I try sending again or try closing the port after this exception I get Access to the port is denied.

Negative 79102 pIm working on an iOS 5 project with storyboards, and thus using dynamic table cell prototypes in IB. In one of the views, Ive got a table view with variableheight cells, with the cell height calculated from the height of the contents.p  pcodetableViewheightForRowAtIndexPathcode returns correct values for all cells when the table view is first displayed. All is well when scrolling down for a few items, but then something goes amiss the actual cells seem to be correct height, including their touch areas, but their separators are rendered in the wrong places inside cells instead of between them.p  pFrom measuring the separator placement, it appears as if cell reuse might have something to do with this. The separators for the first three cells are rendered correctly, but not the fourth one. codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode returns the correct height for it 125 pixels in this case, and its contained subviews are all in their right places. However, the separator is rendered only 108 pixels from the previous separator, placing it inside the 125 pixel high area of the cell. p  pHeres the kicker 108px is the height of the first table cell, now out of sight and probably reused. I dont have definite proof of this, but it appears that the table view is ignoring codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode for these cells and is just rendering the separator according to the reused cell height.p  pThis doesnt explain why a bunch of later, shorter cells are not rendered separators at all. But this is all Ive got to go on.p  pIs there a workaround, an IB setting or something else that might helpp

This works fine, but the styling of my custom title area is not the same as the standard title styling height, color, separator, etc.p  pMy question is strongwith the understanding that styling varies by OS version and manufacturerstrong, how can I style my custom title in the dialog so that it will match the standard title styling for other AlertDialogsp  pHere is an image of anAlertDialog with standard styling this is from ICS, but I want to be able to match any variant  not this particular style  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com656qD.png altenter image description herep  pAnd here is an image of an AlertDialog with custom title and buttons note how the title height and color dont match the standard dialog img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBJwsf.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT I cant just add the ImageButtons to the standard title view, because I dont have access to it.  strongIf you know of a reliable, nonhack method for me to add buttons to the standard title area, I would accept that as well.strongp

Negative 79102 pIm writing a rails app that has a model called User and a model called Page. Users can have multiple pages, and users can also authorize other users to view their pages. To describe this in rails, Im using a hasmany, through relationship with a third model Ive created called Authorization. The models look something like thisp  precodeclass User   hasmany pages, dependent destroy   hasmany authorizations, dependent destroy   hasmany viewablepages, through gt authorizations, source gt page end  class Page   belongsto user    hasmany authorizations, dependent destroy   hasmany authorizedviewers, through gt authorizations, source gt user end  class Authorization   belongsto page   belongsto user end codepre  pAs far as backend functionality goes, this has been working perfectly for me. Im a little stumped when it comes to rendering these relationships and allowing the client to modify them.p  pI have a controller for Page, and when show is called, I render the page. When I render the page, I also want to render the pages list of authorizedviewers and allow the user to modify that list with AJAX commands. Essentially, I want to do something like this in the Page layoutp  precodelt authorizedviewers.each do v gt   ltligtlt v.email gtlt linkto delete, authorization, method delete, remote true gtltligt lt end gt codepre  pIm not quite sure how to reference the authorization itself, and not the authorizedviewer. I just want to delete the relationship, not the user. Im also not sure if I should make a controller for Authorization in order to create methods like destroy, which I can modify  and give them the ability to respond to AJAX calls. Authorizations will only be rendered on the Page view, so it doesnt seem to make sense generate a whole scaffold with views for Authorizations. Whats the best way to approach thisp  pI realize this is a very long question. Any insight would be tremendously appreciatedp

Negative 79102 pWill the Mono.Data.Sqlite library be implementing the DbConnectionSqliteConnection and DbCommandSqliteCommand for the upcoming release of the sqlite3s support for the WinRT buildp  pI know or at least cant find any references that the MetroWinRT does not contain the System.Data.Common namespace. p  pI am developing a crossplatform app that uses a sqlite database and would like to have a total reuse of the database layer at least. Also, CSharpSqlite does not have all the features of sqlite yet.p  pI know that the csharpsqlite library currently supports WinRT, but it would be nice to rely on fewer entities in development. I am currently going to have to rely on XamarinMono for DesktopiOSAndroid and CSharpSqlite for WinRTWPSilverlight. strongIf sqlite3.dll was going to natively support WinRT then Mono.Data.Sqlite.dll could as wellstrongp  pstrongMaybe after the WinRT support for sqlite3, the guys could find their way to supporting Silverlight and Windows Phonestrong p  pAny takersp

Negative 79102 pI am using riak and riak search to store and index text files. For every file I create a riak object the text content of the file is the object value and save it to a riak bucket. That bucket is configured to use the default search analyzer.p  pI would like to store and be able to search by some metadata for these files. Like date of submission, size etc.p  pSo I have asked on IRC, and also given it quite some thought. Here are some solutions, though they are not as good as I would likep  ol lipI could have a second metadata object that stores the data in question maybe in another bucket, have it indexed etc. But that is not a very good solution especially if I want to be able to do combined searches like valuesomeword AND datesomedatepli lipI could put the contents of the file inside a JSON object like datesomedate, valuesome big blob of text. This could work, but its going to put too much load on the search indexer, as it will have to first deserialize a big json object and those files are sometimes quite big.pli lipI could write a custom analyzerindexer that reads my file object and generatesindexes the metadata in question. The only real problem here is that I have a hard time finding documentation on how to do that. And it is probably going to be a bit of an operational PITA as I will need to push some erlang code to every riak node and remember to do that when I update the cluster, when I add new nodes etc. I might be wrong on this, if so, please, correct me.pli ol  pSo the best solution for me would be if I could alter the riak search index document, and add some arbitrary search fields to it, after it gets generated. Is this possible, is this wise, and is there support for this in libraries etc. I can certainly modify the document in question manually, as a bucket with index documents gets automatically created, but as I said, I just dont know whats the right thing to do.p

Negative 79102 pIm using a hrefhttpdesignwithpc.comPluginsHovercard relnofollowhovercarda to display a small profile card of a user. Within this hovercard I am attempting to include a Twitter Bootstrap dropdown button.p  pThe button is being included in the html and the css is working fine along with the actual javascript to open the dropdown. The problem is that the dropdowns menu cannot be seen.p  pTake a look at the image for a better explanation img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comylHHQ.jpg altexample problemp  pThe 2nd example hovercard is the default result. As you can see, a small portion of the dropdown menu is being shown, but for some reason it is being hidden by the bounds of the hovercard box.p  pIn the 1st example, Ive removed the default bootstrap css position option and the dropdown inherits a position of static. When static is used, the menu can be seen but it increases the size of the hovercard box.p  pWhat I need to have happen, is when the carrot is clicked have the dropdown boxlist open on top of the hovercard and not expand the hovercards dimensions but instead have the dropdown act as its own object with its own dimensions.p  pAs an aside  I have checked both zindexs of the hovercard and the dropdown and the dropdowns zindex is higher so that should not be the issue.p  pEDIT Actual example markupp  precodeltdiv classhcpreview stylezindex 0 gtlta classprofilecard hcname relhovercard datatypecustom datawidth370 dataurlomegaajaxProfileProfileCardeid1 hrefomegaprofileprofileviewid1 stylezindex 0 gtltimg classavatar thumb srcomegaimages1darthmaul.png altAvatargtltagtltdiv classhcdetails stylewidth 370px backgroundcolor rgb255, 255, 255 display none backgroundposition initial initial backgroundrepeat initial initial gtltdiv classscard scardpadgtltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefomegaassets5583cf06cssbootstrapyii.cssgt   ltdiv classhovercardgt  ltimg classthumb alignleft srcomegaimages1darthmaul.png altPaul Johesphatgtlth1gt Paul Johesphatltspan classbadge badgesuccess reltooltip dataoriginaltitleThis person is an expert in our communitygtExpertltspangtlth1gt lth2gtAdvisorlth2gt  lth2gt lth2gt  ltdiv classclearfixgtltdivgt ltdiv stylefloatright displayblockgt  ltdiv idloadinggtltdivgt    ltdiv idconnectbutton1gt ltdiv classbtngroup opengt   ltbutton classbtngtlti classiconokgtltigt Friendltbuttongt   ltbutton classbtn dropdowntoggle datatoggledropdowngt     ltspan classcaretgtltspangt   ltbuttongt   ltul classdropdownmenugt             ltligt             ltspan classinstructgtAdd to Listltspangt             ltligt             ltli classdividergtltligt  ltdiv idlistgt ltligt lta href idyt0gtAcquaintanceltagtltligt  ltligt lta href idyt1gtClose Friendltagtltligt  ltligt lta href idyt2gtColleagueltagtltligt  ltligt lta href idyt3gtProspectltagtltligt  ltdivgt         ltli classdividergtltligt         ltligtlta id1 classremove hrefomegafriendshipfriendshipremoverequestgtRemove Connection Requestltagtltligt   ltulgt ltdivgtltdivgtltdivgtltdivgtltdivgtltdivgtltdivgt codepre

Negative 79102 pA form is submitted using jQuery form plugin to an action in MVC framework. In the action, if form validation fails a reply should be sent back to the client. jQuery form plugin comes with error and success callbacks like any other jQuery Ajax functions. Isnt it a better practice to return an HTTP Exception with errorcode 400 Bad Request and catch it in error callback rather than returning a successful HTTP response and catching it in success callbackp  pIf the answer is yes, wouldnt it be more descriptive to have data attached to HTTP Exception From what I see right now, codeHTTPException.Datacode is readonly. One of the constructors seems to do the job codeHttpExceptionSerializationInfo, StreamingContextcode but I cant wrap my head around it.

Negative 79102 pI have developed an application which allows users to enter measurements  these are stored in an Oracle database. Each measurement session could contain around 100 measurements. There could be around 100 measurement sessions in a batch, so thats 10,000 measurements per batch. There could easily be around 1000 batches at some point, bringing the total number of measurements into the millions.p  pThe problem is that calculations and statistics need to be performed on the measurements. It ranges from things like average measurements per batch to statistics across the last 6 months of measurements. p  pMy question is is there any way that I can make the process of calculating these statistics faster Either through the types of queries Im running or the structure of the databasep  pThanksp

So Id like to be able to construct a timeline of the formp  ol liClient sends a request to my serverli liServer sends back a 200 response, which the client receivesli liThe server does additional processing, logging, etcli ol  pIn play 1.x I believe I could annote my additional processing logic with a Finally and have it work like I want it to.p

Negative 79102 pIm porting a program to Eigen.p  pNow I have to rewrite a method that returns the 3D transformation matrix from one coordinate system A, defined by its origin and two axes, to a second coordinate system, still defined by the origin and two axes.p  pI was wondering if theres a method in Eigen to find that matrix. I browsed the reference guide but I did not find any useful method yet...p  hr  pMore in detailsp  pThe method Im porting to Eigen accepts 6 Points vectors fr0, fr1, fr2, to0, to1, to2. fr0 is the origin of CS1 Coordinate System 1, fr1 is a point defining an axis of the CS1, fr2 is the point defining a second axis of CS1 to0 is the origin of CS2, and so on... p
Negative 79102 pHey Everyone have a question here about parsing some XML in C .net 4 MVC 3.p  pI have a Map HashMap that is serialized to XML from a java app.p  pI need to parse this into an object on the dotnet side but cant seem to figure it out.  In my research I see you cant serialize into codeDictionaryltstring, stringgtcode.  p  pSomeone else suggested a codepublic struct KeyValuePairltK, Vgtcode but that didnt seem to work.  p  pAlso tried an code[XmlArraymapConfig]codep  pOne of the prerequisites is we have to use codeSystem.Xml.Serializationcode because we have an abstract messenger class and I would like to avoid changing that if I dont absolutely have to.p  pIf I have to I could possiblly change the Java object if that would make this easier but would rather use the one already there if possible.  If it helps the Java layer is using Xstream.p  pHere is a chunk of XML that is being sent from Javap  precodeltConfigurationMapgt     ltmapConfig classhashtablegt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey1ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue1ltstringgt       ltentrygt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey2ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue2ltstringgt       ltentrygt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey3ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue3ltstringgt       ltentrygt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey4ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue4ltstringgt       ltentrygt     ltmapConfiggt ltConfigurationMapgt codepre  pThanks, please let me know if you need more information.

Negative 79102 pTesting InApp Billing Version 3 has been made unpredictable by the fact that the Google Play app buffers data from the Google Play servers, and the buffering process is not welldocumented.  In particular, if a purchase is made on one of a users devices, it may not be immediately visible on a different device owned by that same user.p  pRecommended practice is for an app to check the inventory of all purchased products when it is started.  But sometimes this check uses buffered data that is already stale due to updates made via the same app on a different device, or via Google Checkout e.g., a refund or a canceled order.p  pWhat are the circumstances under which a change made to purchase data on the Google Play servers becomes available on a Google Play app running on a device that did not initiate that update  p  pSpecifically, how can one ensure during testing that data returned by a check using queryInventoryAsync a method of the IabHelper class supplied with the TrivialDrive sample app reflects what is presently on the Google Play servers, rather than being possibly stale buffered datap

Negative 79102 pIm implementing a turnbased game with multiplayer mode through gamecenter. I have 2 devices 1 ipad, 1 iphone to test in sandbox mode which were working fine but lately it has started to struggle in auto matchmaking process. After I send the first turn from one user, the other device doesnt immediately recognize that game but opens up its own fresh game. Before it was able to immediately spot the game started in the other device and matchmaking was fairly straightforward. And I dont remember changing any parts relevant to matchmaking codeNSCodingcode, codeGKTurnBasedEventHandlercode, codeGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllerDelegatecode delegate methods etc. p  pNow I send the first turn from one device and need to wait around 1 min so the other device can successfully connect to that game. After connection occurs endTurnWithMatchData calls work without any problems, it can send and receive data within 12 secs. But it wont be a good UX if users start a fresh game and had to wait 1 min so another user can connect to his game. Has anyone been experiencing significant lag in auto matchmaking process I didnt implement invitations yet, so I cannot check it. The matchdata I archive with NSKeyedArchiver seemed quite big, 3396 bytes, even for a fresh game with almost no data.

Negative 79102 pIm looking to get some insight on a project of mine before I get too deep into it with possibly a poor setup. The app is a simple database collection with a few table views.p  pQuick example First table view is populated with teacher names. Select the teacher and the next table view is populated with all of the students in that class. Further, select that student and an info view arises with details for that student.p  pThe plan is to use SQLite, so Im looking to make sure I set views up properly to make it easier on myself later.p  pMy thoughts so farp  pTeacherViewController  Grab info from DB to populate the table view. Contains segue within didSelectRowAtIndexPath to jump to StudentView.p  pStudentViewController  Again grabs info from the DB from that teachers table to populate with students, with a segue to jump to info page.p  pStudentInfoView  Contains the forms ready to be populated with info.p  pThere needs to be the ability to add teachers, as well as add students within each teacherclass. Since I havent dove into SQLite yet, Id like advice from those experienced.p  pThanks, and let me answer any questions you may have.p

This would ensure that i would be able to leverage all the existing validation functionality existing within aui while being able to add my own logic for analytics.. Admittedly, this is not preferable as i would have to put in this logic in a lot of places in every JSP but at least i will have a solution for what essentially is a critical blocker for me right now.p  pI am keeping this as a separate question as this question is more pointed towards custom validations and a lot of people looking at this even for things other than web analytics would find this useful.p  pLooking forward to some guidance from the community...p

Negative 79102 pSo this is a pretty standard requirement I have a table holding address information and I want to pull out a single, formatted address with all the fields concatenated with comma separators.  p  pThe problem is that some fields can be NULL and so I end up with trailing commas.  For example, one address might be 10 The Strand, London with no country on the end but the next one might be 5 Fleet Street, London, England.  If I pick out each address element and assume it is always present then I would present these two addresses asp  p5 Fleet Street, , , London,p  p10 The Strand, , , London, Englandp  pGetting rid of the extra commas from the middle is simple, just a test for NULL.p  pI know how to fix the trailing comma problem in two passes, either using a CTE or a subquery, but can this be done in a single pass through the datap  pHere is an example using a CTEp  precodeDECLARE Address TABLE      Name VARCHAR255,     Line1 VARCHAR255,     Line2 VARCHAR255,     Line3 VARCHAR255,     City VARCHAR255,     Country VARCHAR255 INSERT INTO Address VALUES Complete, Test 1, Test 2, Test 3, Oxford, England INSERT INTO Address VALUES Incomplete, 22 Accacia, NULL, NULL, York, England INSERT INTO Address VALUES Missing End, 10 Bond Street, NULL, NULL, London, NULL WITH Addresses AS  SELECT     CASE WHEN Name IS NULL THEN  ELSE Name  ,  END       CASE WHEN Line1 IS NULL THEN  ELSE Line1  ,  END       CASE WHEN Line2 IS NULL THEN  ELSE Line2  ,  END       CASE WHEN Line3 IS NULL THEN  ELSE Line3  ,  END       CASE WHEN City IS NULL THEN  ELSE City  ,  END       CASE WHEN Country IS NULL THEN  ELSE Country  ,  END AS [Address] FROM     Address SELECT LEFT[Address], LEN[Address]  1 AS [Address Clean] FROM Addresses codepre  pWhich gives mep  precodeComplete, Test 1, Test 2, Test 3, Oxford, England Incomplete, 22 Accacia, York, England Missing End, 10 Bond Street, London codepre  pWhy do I want this  Partly because I cant think of a way to do this but feel there should be a way to get what I want and partly because this query is running over a linked server to a SQL 2000 box and so I cant use CTEs although I could easily rewrite the query using a sub query instead.p

Negative 79102 pIm trying to write the sieve of Eratosthenes in Coq. I have a function codecrossout  forall nnat, vector bool n gt nat gt vector bool ncode. When the sieve finds a number that is prime, it uses codecrossoutcode to mark all the numbers that are not prime and then recurses on the resulting vector. The sieve obviously cant be structurally recursive on the vector itself, but it is structurally recursive on the length of the vector. What I want is to do something like thisp  precodeFixpoint sieve nnat vvector bool n accnat struct n  list nat    match v with      [] gt Datatypes.nil      false  v gt sieve v S acc      true  v gt Datatypes.cons acc sieve crossout v acc S acc   end. codepre  pBut if I write it like this, Coq complains that the length of codevcode is not a subterm of codencode.

Negative 79102 pThere is currently a debate or rather heated argument at work about the USE keyword at the top of a SQL Server script. p  pOne of our developers has said it is well known that utilizing the codeUSEcode keyword is bad practise. His argument is that if the developer is using the correct login then this should specify the appropriate database automatically and the USE keyword only encourages the misuse of the SA account. At our site, his concern is borne out by the fact that misuse of SA has occurred in the past, although steps are being taken to remove this issue.p  pOther developers argue that due to the nature of our work we quite often work on multiple databases in a day, sometimes switching tasks at very short notice, having the codeUSEcode keyword is beneficial for readability as a reminder of which database we are working on and to prevent accidental use of an SP in the wrong database. p  pAfter extensive searching on the internet, I can only find examples demonstrating its utilization and cannot find any discussion of it in a good practise context. Although searching is hampered by the fact that USE is a very common word p  pWhat are the standards for this Is the USE keyword really bad practise or is it good to have it as a fallbackp  pI would appreciate any input  thanks in advancep

Which I can download and install and which uses my internet connection to perform load testp  pMy server IP is 103.14.96.209 and  Domain is muthootfinance.com p  pAlso If i ping it using cmd command the ping time is only 32secs but if I ping using online services like pingdom the ping time comes more than 300 secs. Please help me out.p
Negative 79102 pI have the following set of blocks divsspans on a pagep  precodeCAPTION 1 CONTENT 1  CAPTION 2 CONTENT 2  ....  CAPTION N CONTENT N codepre  pI need to make the Captions sticky at the top of the page on scroll. E.g.p  precodeCAPTION 1 CAPTION 2  CAPTION 3 CONTENT 3 .... codepre  pSo, the CONTENT of the 1st and 2nd blocks got collapsed, but the captions remained visible. Besides, I need to add the onclick event for the sticky captions. Once the sticky caption is clicked, the page should be scrolled up to the correspondent CONTENT.p  pThis should work similar to the bootstrap affix plugin, but the captions should become fixed on scroll only.p  pHow can this be achieved Are there any plugins with the similar functionalityp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 79102 pNote Im not asking how to use multicast or broadcast for a whole session, only for the handshakep  pI was wondering whether an idea I had could be implemented in a Linux program without any changes to the kernel.

Negative 79102 pIm new to this site  So I apologise if Ive done anything wrong.p  pBasically, I currently have a PHP and javascript Paypal form, which provides 9 dropdown questions to my customers. After they have entered this data, they are then able to click a Paypal button and the price automatically shows with the amount dependant on their choices.p  pHowever, as Paypal has a description limit  I was wondering if its possible for this form to send the user a Paypal page, and then send me an email with their data entry too.p  pIts for a Custom Gaming Controller business, so I need to know ALL of their personalisation choices.p  pA database seems too complicated... As I will constantly keep updating the choices.p  pI have the dropdown bit sorted, and the Paypal button sorted. It all works completely fine using .csv files for the variables and prices. However, I need it to send an email to myself.p  pCan anyone do thisp  pIf you need to see the current code, just let me know. Could really do with someone doing this for me. Will happily provide a detailed review for your potential clients.p  precodeltphp class Controller        public currency     public shipping      public controllerDir        public questionfour

Negative 79102 pI have an array of lightweight objects, each of which is the Subject of an Observer pattern. To conserve memory, when the Subject is no longer observed, i want to release the objects resources and make it remove itself from the parent array. So how do I ask either the parent object or the Array itself to splice the item, from code within the item itself What I came up with is something likep  precodevar parentObj      items  [],    addItem  function          var newItem  new ItemObj        items.pushnewItem    ,    removeItem  function item         for var i  this.items.length i i lt 0              if this.items[i]  item                  this.items.splicei, 1                 return                              function ItemObj  ItemObj.prototype      observers  [],    observerRemove  functionobserver        find observer in observers array and splice it out            ....        now heres the part where it gets tricky        if this.observers.length  0            parentObj.removeItemthis            ,    observerAdd.... etc   codepre  pWhich works, but only because parentObj is a named variable, if it were a class, it would not be so easy. Also, this seems a little clumsy.  It would be nice if ItemObj could have some reference to its parent Array object, but I cant find that. Any suggestions Perhaps passing a reference from parentObj of itself to each ItemObj as inp  precode              newItem.parentArray  this.items codepre  pwhen creating the itemObj Again, seems clumsy.p

Negative 79102 pWhen writing contextmenu shell extensions, I like the approach of just capturing the list of selected files on which the user rightclicked, and then pass them to an external program in some way. The main work is done in the external program, which has its own GUI, and runs in a separate process. The shell extension code just passes the list of selected files to the external program.p  pIt seems to me that this approach is followed also by other utilities, like 7zip.p  pBut would it be possible to create e.g. a dialogbox directly from inside the shell extension, inside Explorer process My understanding is that the code in the shell extension should try to do as few things as possible, and return the control to Explorer, to not hang Explorer process.p  pIf I create a dialogbox inside the shell extension handler e.g. in my implementation of codeIContextMenuInvokeCommandcode, what would be the right approach to followp  pAssuming that in dialogbox codeOnInitDialogcode implementation I setup the GUI of the dialogbox, should I then call something like codeDoMainWorkcode, and inside this method insert a message loop to process messagesbr e.g.p  precode 1.

Inside CMyDialog class  LRESULT CMyDialogOnInitDialog      ... prepare the GUI of the dialogbox      DoMainWork         3. Inside CMyDialogDoMainWork    for ... loop to iterate over selected files ...      ... do some processing for current file       Process messages      including e.g. the pressing of a Stop button by the user     MSG msg     while PeekMessageampmsg, mhWnd, 0, 0, PMREMOVE          TranslateMessageampmsg         DispatchMessageampmsg       codepre

When I read a new record from CSV, I need to check if that record already exists strongincluding records that I have already importedstrong before Saving, so I can update it instead of creating a new record. p  pThe simple solution is to just codeSaveChangescode after every codedbContext.Entities.AddnewEntitycode call but I suspect that is not very efficient.

Negative 79102 pWe started designing a process for detecting changes in our ERP database for creating datawarehouse databases. Since they dont like placing triggers on the ERP databases or even enabling CDC sql server, we are thinking in reading changes from the databases that get replicated to a central repository through transaction replication, then have an extra copy that will merge the changes we will have CDC on the extra copy...p  pI wonder if there is a possibility where data that changes within, lets say 15 minutes, is important enough to consider a change in our design, the way we plan in designing this would not be able to track every single change, it will only get the latest after a period of time, so for example if a value on a row changes from A to B, then 1 minute later, changes from B to C, the replication system will bring that last value to the central repository, then we will merge the table with our extra copy that extra copy might have had the value of A, then it will be updated with C, and we lost the value of B.p  pIs there a good scenario in a data warehouse database where you need to track ALL changes a table has gone through p

Negative 79102 pI have a question about indicating multiplicity in an UML diagram.p  pI have a SpriteObject class, which has a list of animations. The SpriteObject can have 0.. animations. All animations are created inside the SpriteObject and do not exist on their own.p  pIm not 100 sure how I should indicate this with multiplicity. After searching the web I have found the following 3 optionsp  pOption 1 The multiplicity should be indicated like this, because every SpriteObject has 0 or more Animations. There is no multiplicity indicated on side of the SpriteObject since the Animation has no clue about the existence of the SpriteObject. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRbxSd.png altenter image description herep  pOption 2 The multiplicity should be indicated on both sides like this because we need to indicate the local relationship between the two classes so 1 SpriteObject has 0 or more Animations.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWTomb.png altenter image description herep  pOption 3 The multiplicity should be indicated on both sides likes this, because we need to be able to read the multiplicity and understand it as part of the wholethe game. The game can contain 0.. SpriteObjects and the SpriteObject can contain 0.. Animations. Thats why 0.. SpriteObjects has 0..

Negative 79102 pI am attempting to upsize Access 2010 backend database to Azure using the Access Upsize Wizard.  I have no problem doing this locally to my own SQL Server 2008 R2 or SQL Express.  When I try to upsize to Azure I first get the following error...p  pCould not find stored procedure xpmsverp  pThen get error...p  pThe Upsizing Wizard does not work with the version of Microsoft SQL Server to which your Access project is connected.  See the Microsoft Office Update Web site for the latest information and downloads.p  pI assume this last error is solely due to the first error.  Is it not possible to upsize to Azurep  pUPDATE I tried to use SQL Server Management Studio ExportImport wizard to export from my local SQL Server 2008 R2 to Azure.  Thought at first it may work, but then got error on a table Tables without a clustered index are not supported in this version of SQL server.p  pI could possibly modify the initial tables, but there are probably 100 tables and figure this could take a lot of effort without any guarantee. p  pReally, I am just trying to upsize to any cloud SQL Server. Have tried a couple of others and have run into the problem that they do not provide dbo rights, which Access upsize requires.  I think DiscountASP.net does,  but a little expensive when you have to pay per database and I have 3 small ones.p
Negative 79102 pI am writing a program that will get a user to select their zodiac sign and another persons sign. Once that comes in, I want to use the signs to gauge their compatibility, the result of which falls into 3 categories. I have the program to the point where the user can select both signs and the program can spit them back out to tell the user what they selected I dont need this message box, I was just doing it to check that my code was working. The part I am having trouble with is making the compatibility function and also using the select case, I dont know if I need to declare new variables or if they will work if I made them public.

I want the result to look like thisp  precodeD2  11 15, 2 20, 3  0, 4 50, 5  0, 6100,       21 14, 2 21, 3 25, 4  0, 5 75, 6  0,       31 16, 2  0, 3 24, 4  0, 5 74, 6102,       codepre  pI know this should be a fairly easy problem, but I have been trying for hours now and I can not get my head around this. The Problem is, that, if I find a number with no partner, I need to make placeholder zeros in all the other lines recursivly.p  pEDIT You are right ofcourse, I simply forgot the keys in the dictionary D.

However, not only does this not seem to actually work, but it changes the format of the number to have a dollar  symbol in front of it and because we display the actual attribute value on the product page, on top of using it to sort by, we doesnt work as a fix.p  pIm trying to figure out exactly how the getSortOrder method works but it looks like this functionality is pretty deeply embedded so Im struggling to figure a workaround for this bug.  p  pAny help is appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pFor anyone looking to solve this issue in the future, heres the fix I came up withp  pYoull need to override the function getProductCollection in List.php that is stored in appCodeMagecorecatalogblockproductlist.php.br Copy the file to appcodeMagelocalcatalogblockproductlist.php so that you arent editing core files.  p  pThen below where it saysp  precodethisgtproductCollection  layergtgetProductCollection codepre  pPut the following codep  precode         Start of Code to force Magento to numerically sort decimal attributes rather than alphabetically          filterAttribute  thisgtgetRequestgtgetParamorder         filterAttributeDir  thisgtgetRequestgtgetParamdir         attributeType  MagegetModeleaventityattributegtloadByCodecatalogproduct, filterAttributegtgetFrontendClass           If a Sort By option is selected on category page and attribute has frontendclass  validatenumber or validatedigits           then CAST the attribute values as signed integers          if issetfilterAttribute ampamp attributeType  validatedigits  attributeType  validatenumber               thisgtproductCollectiongtgetSelectgtresetZendDbSelectORDER             thisgtproductCollectiongtgetSelectgtorderCAST . filterAttribute .

Negative 79102 pUsually, when you develop code with Javascript or C, you use CamelCase for your variables to make the code easier to read.p  pHowever, Im a Dynamics CRM 2011 developer, and one of the quirks of Dynamics CRM has to do with field naming. Basically, if you create a field in Dynamics CRM, it saves the name in 2 different formats once with with the casing as you enter it for example newSocialSecurityNumber and once in complete lowercase for example newsocialsecuritynumber.p  pThe tricky part is that depending on the context the name is used, you are forced to use a specific version. For example, in Javascript, if you want to get the value of a field from the form, you use lowercase, BUT if you want to retrieve the value using a webservice, you need to use the version with casing both for the call itself and the return. Similarly, if youre developing in C, depending on whether you use early or late binding, you either use with or without casing.p  pnow, with Early binding, C has Intellisense, and with Late binding, its all lowercase, so thats not that big of a deal, but Javascript has barely any Intellisense related to CRM, and none for field names or webservice related values, so its a lot easier to work with those fields if you always put the names in lowercase.p  pBecause of the need to use both a correctly cased and a lowercased name of the same field, whenever I create a field in CRM, Im writing it in full lowercase. This means that both versions of the name are the same, which makes development easier. However, this is not the recommended naming convention for development in C or Javascript. Is this an acceptable reason to ignore naming conventions What are the disadvantages of ignoring the naming conventions in this casep

Negative 79102 pI have a grid based graph, where nodes and edges occupy cells. Edges can cross, but cannot travel on top of each other in the same direction. p  pLets say I want to optimize the graph so that the distance covered by edges is minimized. I am currently using A search for each connection, but the algorithm is greedy and does not plan ahead. Consider the diagram below, where the order in which connections are made is changed note also that there can be multiple shortest paths for any given edge, see green and  purple connections. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comigEwd.png altenter image description herep  pMy intuition says this is NPComplete and that an exhaustive search is necessary, which will be extremely expensive as the size of the graph grows. However, I have no way of showing this, and it is not quite the same as other graph embedding problems which usually concern minimization of crossing.p

Negative 79102 pI have just started investigating the differences between creating Mac applications and iOS which I have now become quite comfortable with. One of the main issues Im having is finding resources on how I should be organising my app as any Cocoa developer would do on the Mac. With iOS I am used to utilising codeUIViewControllerscodecodeUITableViewControllerscode, and storyboards. The paradigm seems different on the Mac, obviously having windows changes things.p  pThe application I want to begin with will have just one window, with a small popup window occasionally and also a preferences screen. The main window will also have a bunch of tabs that users can access different information from. My main question would be how to structure this  using the default Mac template it loads for me the xib file and depends on the AppDelegate to work with the UI. Should I be creating a subclass of codeUIWindowControllercode to then load the nib file and work with my UI from there If so is there somewhere I can read on how nibs work with the codeUIWindowControllercodesp  pAny other tips on what is different in structuring Mac apps codewise versus iOS would be very helpful.p  pThanksp

Also there is an issue with how I implement the hash table and how it gets implemented behind the scenes by the V8 engine in node.p  pI can either have it as a javascript array of length TABLESIZE and do something likep  precodevar table  new Array  table[hashCodeLo  TABLESIZE]       hashCodeLo hashCodeLo,     hashCodeHi hashCodeHi,     someProperty someValue  codepre  pwhere hashCodeLo and hashCodeHi denote the higher and lower 32 bits of the code and TABLESIZE lt 232. I store these to detect collisions from doing the  TABLESIZE bit. Now Im guessing since TABLESIZE is large and Im assigning elements non contiguously V8 will kick this into dictionary mode anyways so I might as well not bother making it an array indexed by an integer up to TABLESIZE and instead do something likep  precodevar table    table[hashCode]       someProperty someValue  codepre  pwhere here hashCode is just a string representation of my 64 bits hashCode. Since Im not sure how dictionary mode works behind the scenes Im not sure which is better. Also I dont know if Im using more memory by using keys like 1983981918391 vs a more compact representation likep  precodehashCode  String.fromCharCodeFIRST16BITS, SECOND16BITS, THIRD16BITS, FOURTH16BITS codepre  pIm not even sure if this works the way I intend...p  pSince this is a critical part of the engine I want to squeeze as much performance as I can out of this so any help is appreciated.p

Negative 79102 pstrongThe backgroundstrongp  pAs a beginner in Three.js I was advised to use dat.gui as an interface to change variables because incorporating WebGLthree.js into a webpageweb app was complicated. This advice matched my research. Many three.js learners were using dat.gui and I found there were a number of new framworks in beta that were building on three.js to try and make WebGL integration into web pages easier. p  pHaving worked with three.js and dat.gui Im now at a stage where dat.gui does not have all the options I would like. For example a date picker and text input constraints. So Id like to move forward and create my own interface. p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pWhat are the technical problems associated with incorporating WebGLthree.js into a webpage or a webappp  pIf Im aware of some of the issues in advance I can make better decisions.

Negative 79102 pI have 45 intensively computing processes running on a Windows server with 16 CPU cores and 128GB memory. It seems that running all these processes together is slower in total than running 16 processes at a time meaning that I divided them into 3 parts. The processes I running also need a lot of memory. They will first read data from disk, and then do some computing for about 5 hours in the condition that I run a single one. Reading data is not timeconsuming, 10 minutes are enough if I run a single process. Can anyone give me some explanations about itp  pUPDATE Sorry for my expression of the question. What I want to know is why there exists some huge difference in running time between these two ways. I think 10 slower is normal, but more than 50 I will be glad if you have some explanation on how OS schedule the processes, which will lead to such problem.p

Negative 79102 pI am using codeSWRevealViewControllercode for the SideMenu which has a Login option. Upon clicking the Login button on sideMenu codeSWRevealViewControllercode I use a modal segue to go to codeLoginViewControllercode . The reason I use a modal segue is because I want a Cancel option in my codeLoginViewControllercode Navigation bar and also I go to codeLoginVCcode from other view controllers later , hence I do not want a pushSWRevealView Segue.p  pProblem   After I click on Login , It takes about 30 seconds to go to Login screen .p  pI have print statement in Prepareforsegue of codeSidemenuviewcontrollercode and another one in codeviewdidloadcode method of codeLoginViewControllercode. The successive time between the prints is 30 seconds too. My understand is ,codeSWrevealViewControllercode is presenting a view in between the transfers. I am not sure though.p  pKindly suggest any possible workaroundsp

Negative 79102 pSo I have been working on creating a CSS 3d panoramic photo viewer.  I load a sprite sheet with all 6 sides of my cubic map on it, and I load each section onto a separate canvas and position those canvases on the 6 sides of my cube.  Everything was working great and smooth until I tried a higher resolution image.  This is where the issues came in.p  pThere seems to be a pixel restriction on certain devices.  The bug I am experiencing seems to only appear in Chrome on certain devices, so far on a Galaxy Tab 10.1, a Galaxy S3 and an Acer Iconia A1830. It works fine on all desktop browsers.p  pThe bug is as follows. If the image is larger than 1567  9400 a 16 ratio then the browser sets a limitation on the width of the element.  This causes my math on the sprite sheet to screw up, and causes a cumulative drift.  Thus more than half of the face that should cover the bottom is on the top, and the last little bit left is stretched across the whole of the bottom.p  pIf I make the image smaller than the dimensions given above, it works fine on devices.  I am rather stumped about what this bug might be.  It seems to be device specific, perhaps a limitation put on the canvas by the different hardware manufacturers.p  pHere is the code I am using to build my canvas cubep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction buildCube      var sides, imageRatio, canvasLength, media, cubeSprite       If the player isnt passed in, or there is no media data, throw and error.     ifcssPlayer  cssPlayer.mediaData          console.errorCannot build cube without media data.         return false            Grab media     media  cssPlayer.mediaData.media.cubic[0]       Array of sides to be created     sides  [front, right, back, left, top, bottom]     imageRatio  media.height     canvasLength  cube.config.canvasLength      var cubeSprite  document.createElementimg     cubeSprite.style.display  none     document.body.appendChildcubeSprite      cubeSprite.onload  function          console.logImage loaded.

Negative 79102 pI dont know much about migrations, but this is a specific question Im not sure how to answer.p  pIn production, how can one change the database formatschema when there is already user data in there Is the answer different for our Meteor app on MongoDB vs our master Postgres database Basically, if you write new code that introduces a new field, and new code that expects that new field to be present, then the system will not work when pulling data from the database that was there prior to the changeover.p  pFor Mongo at least, a possible solution is to write a script to update the database layout with the data in it, but I wonder if this is too error prone for a production database, and infeasible when you just dont have the necessary information like if you didnt collect a certain info field from the user before.p

The function generateNumbers just makes a vector of size length with numbers from the given range and swap simply swaps two elements from the array. Now I am trying to exploit the fact that all numbers are smaller that 1024. So roughly speaking half of them will contain a 1 in binary representation in the position corresponding to 29512. So we can use that to split the list in two lists. Then we check for both list what the digit corresponding to 28 is and split the list again. I am using the variable mask for this and the operator nampmask is zero if the is smaller then mask and non zero if it is larger that mask. For some reason though, it does not seem to work. Does anyone have any idea why The output list is almost sorted but there are just some mistakes at certain places. If anyone could help me out that would be great.

Negative 79102 pUsing Python 3.4. Have attempted to call function prime2 that returns a booleanalways either True or Falsefrom within an IFstatement.

Negative 79102 pIm querying the calendar events content provider and its returning events that were deleted. At first I thought it would be an easy fix by just modifying my query to filter deleted events, like thisp  precodeUri eventUri  CalendarContract.Events.CONTENTURI selection    CalendarContract.Events.CALENDARID     AND                           CalendarContract.Events.DTSTART   gt  AND                           CalendarContract.Events.DTSTART   lt  AND                           CalendarContract.Events.VISIBLE     AND                           CalendarContract.Events.DELETED     long currentMillisFromEpoch  System.currentTimeMillis                 selectionArgs  new String[]Integer.toStringargs.getIntCALENDARIDARGS, Long.toStringcurrentMillisFromEpoch,                         Long.toStringcurrentMillisFromEpoch  long 3.15569e10, 1, 1  return new CursorLoaderImportCalendarActivity.this, eventUri, EVENTPROJECTION, selection, selectionArgs, CalendarContract.Events.DTSTART   ASC codepre  pAnd the worst part is that it IS working, every event is returned... with DELETED  0. But they are not shown in the calendar app. They were deleted. p  pAny idea what could be happeningp

Negative 79102 pIm getting quite stuck here.p  pIve got Silverlight 5 apps that are hosted in ASPX pages. I am using FormsAuthentication to create a cookie on login.p  pI want to be able to consume WCF services from Silverlight, and have those services be able to set a custom principal based on the identity of the user in Silverlight. I have tried using an IAuthorizationPolicy, but there is never an Identity property in the evaluationContext.p  pAm I missing something, or is it not possible to do this or at least, do it this way when using Silverlight I know the principal isnt used in the same way or not at all in Silverlight, but I am seeing the ASPXAUTH cookie passed to WCF. Is there something else I need to be doing on the Silverlight to pass the identity I would have thought I could get that out of the FormsAuthentication Ticket.p  pI should point out that ultimately I want to use a CustomPrincipal in ASP.NET, and set that in WCF as well.p  pI am using ClientBase to instantiate the service client.

Negative 79102 pI am new to Java Swing. I am trying to do research on how to change pages within the same JFrame within the same window to be specific.p  pWhat I am trying to do is that there are 2 pages.p  pThe first page has a list of selectable contents and a button that says Next. Hitting the next button would create a new page based on the selected content.p  pOn the new page, there is a back button that goes back to the original page, and the original page still remembers the the choice of selected content.p  pHow would I approach this I have looked up CardLayout, but I am not sure if that is the right technique.p  pOriginally, I thought creating 2 classes, each a JFrame. The first class first page upon hitting Next button would instantiate the second class second page. The second page would be on top of the first page in the same window, like a stack.p  pOn the second page, there is Back button which would call this.dispose, which would get rid of the second page popping off the stack but leave first page intact. The problem however is that creating the second page results in a new, separate window instead of being in the same window as first page.p  pAgain, how would I approach thisp  pBy the way, I am aware having multiple JFrames is a bad practice a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9554636theuseofmultiplejframesgoodbadpracticeThe Use of Multiple JFrames, GoodBad Practiceap

Negative 79102 pIm trying to create a makefile that will compile two files main.cpp queue.h Inside of the header file I have the a full implementation of a template Queue class.

Negative 79102 pIm using OpenJPA 1.2.3, the default version that comes with WebSphere 7.0. p  pWhat Im trying to do is to prevent OpenJPA from flushing until commit time.

I know why I get that error, and it can easily be fixed, but due a limiting in the existing custom logics and it cant be modified, I need OpenJPA to defer flushing until commit time. p  precode20150310 214345.622 class org.apache.openjpa.persistence.InvalidStateException Encountered unmanaged object in persistent field com.xxx.yyy.common.model.domain.XxxWorkorder.xxxBundle during flush.

Negative 79102 pAs described in a hrefhttpbugs.python.orgissue22139 relnofollowhttpbugs.python.orgissue22139a, the python27.dll is installed in the windows systems in my case CWindowsSystems32 folder.p  pBut I would like to know why Why is it not installed next to the python.exe, for example in CPython27p  pReason I ask Ive made a mercurial hook in python that our developers need to use to check if the commit message is valid. It checks a.o. for a valid JIRA issue number. To prevent all our developers to install python themselves and install the required modules manually a lot of work and errorprone, I zipped the python installation and asked the developers to unzip it locally. But they cant run it, because the python27.dll is missing, or worse, they already have another minor version of python installed, and the hook will fail due to the wrong python27.dll used. Confusing. If I just add the python27.dll the correct version to the zip file, it all seems to work great. So, why is it not installed in that location in the first place What is the advantage of installing it in CWindowsSystem32p  pHope someone can explain this to me Thanks in advance, Tallandtree.p

The windows size can go from 1111 to 3131 until the validate values inside the sampling windows are enough for the next round calculation, for example like belowp  precodedef ContextualWindows arrb4,arrb5,pfire arrb4,arrb5,pfire are 3131 sampling windows from large 15006400 numpy array     i5     while i in range 5,16         arrb4backarrb4[15i16i,15i16i]          only output the array data when it is large enough           to have enough good quality data to do calculation                if np.ma.countarrb4backgtmin10,0.25ii             arrb5backarrb5[15i16i,15i16i]             pfirebackpfire[15i16i,15i16i]             canfire0             i20         else              ii1  unknown pixel background condition could not be characterized     if i20          canfire1         arrb5backarrb5         pfirebackpfire         arrb4backarrb4     return arrb4back,arrb5back,pfireback,canfire codepre  pThen this dynamic windows will be feed into next round test, for examplep  precodeb4backavenp.meanarrb4Windows b4backdevnp.stdarrb4Windows if b4gtb4backave3.5b4backdev     firetestTrue codepre  pTo run the whole code to my multi 15006400 numpy arrays, it took over half an hour, or even longer.

Negative 79102 pFirst the important information.  I have a development machine that is running Ubuntu 14.04 desktop, MySQL server 5.6 and ruby 2.1.3 with rails 4.2.0.beta2.  I developed an application with two simple tables in MySQL called users and listings.  My app works beautifully on this machine.  I am now migrating it to the production machine.  Only major difference in configuration is that it is running the server edition of Ubuntu and not desktop.  Same version though.  After configuring that machine I checked out my app from source control to production.  When setting up the database I was able to perform rake dbcreate and rake dbschemaload without issue.  I have verified this through running sql queries directly to mysql.  My problem is that I can not insert any data through my rails application.br Note I still need to configure Phusion and Apache completely so I am running from command line and console right now.  I have not tested through my pages yet.p  pWhen I attempted to seed the users table with just one record database using p  precodebundle exec rake dbseed codepre  pI get the following errorp  precodeArgumentError users does not exist to be imported into.

Negative 79102 pWere new to Google Apps as an organization, having completed our implementation last month.

The Excel files connect directly to an MSSQL instance, and read records through stored procedures.p  pJust now I tried to achieve something similar through Apps Script, JDBC and Google Sheets, but the result is agonizingly slow. My test table contains slightly under 9000 rows, and it takes about 5 minutes to load it all.

Negative 79102 pOk so I have a function that allows my user to use the keyboard to go to the next field Which I got the code from SO It works perfect. My problem is, once my user gets to the final text field, in which, Ive selected GO as the return button, and I want to use the go as the ideal submit button. As the flow through the form goes, its presentably right, but the functionality at the end isnt there. I found an answer here, but it looks like its calling the same functions as the next field code. So they dont work well together. So heres what the Next Field code looks likep  precodeoverride func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      Keyboard Next Field amp Delegate     enterEmailTextField.delegate  self     enterPasswordTextField.delegate  self     self.enterEmailTextField.nextField  self.enterPasswordTextField     self.enterPasswordTextField.nextField  self.enterNameTextField      ...  codepre  pAnd the next block is displayed below override which im sure you know codefunc didReceiveMemoryWarning  super.didReceiveMemoryWarning code   p  precode Next Field func textFieldShouldReturntextField UITextField gt Bool      if let nextField  textField.nextField          nextField.becomeFirstResponder           return true  codepre  pOk that works just fine down to the last text field, But since the last field is Go Im trying to mimic what I would do with say an IBAction for a button, but instead the go button.

Negative 79102 pIm working on a search engine using AWS CloudSearch although I think my question is relevant to search engines in general. Lets say I have a document to be indexed that has a text field called strongemNameemstrong with the value codeSomecompanycode. Currently, if I run a query such as codeSomecompanycode, then of course I get that document in the result. p  pHowever, if I run a query like codeSome companycode, then I dont get that same result. I have some basic understanding of search engines and an inverted index. I know that the reason Im not getting the document in the result is because the search engine index is strongonlystrong mapping the document with the token codeSomecompanycode. There might be separate document mappings in the index for the token codeSomecode and for the token codecompanycode, but regardless my document is not mapped to either of them and I wouldnt expect it to be.p  pIs it possible andor practical to index the search engine is such a way as to make the codeSome companycode search query find the codeSomecompanycode document that Im looking forp  pI would also like the reverse situation to work. So, if the document is indexed using the text field codeSome companycode, then Id like the query codeSomecompanycode to find that document.p  pThere is a solution that Ive been thinking about, but I suspect it might go against the principles of an inverted index and be very inefficient. If I index all my documents with an additional field that contains the strongemNameemstrong value compressed every character except letters and numbers removed, and preprocess every query by compressing the value in the same way, then it should work all my queries would be prefix searches.p  pMy concern with this solution is that the inverted index will be filled with unique tokens that only map to a single document. Is that a problem Is there an alternative solution p

Negative 79102 pI am currently working on a project that converts a test from a standard word format to a format that is accepted by the new Saras program we are using.p  pI have been able to parse the file and gather the information that I want. Unfortunately there is a problem with the formatting, I only know how to parse and insert plain text. p  pA few options I have found so far include using the .Copy method and then using the .Paste method on the cell. I am using a class to hold the data intermittently so that if another parsing algorithm needs to be used for the next persons standard format, then the data will still be able to be put into the excel document the same way and the developer only needs to worry about parsing the new format.p  pNOTE If there is a way to paste this into a format like a stand alone cell and then set the cell or cell value to it, that would be great.p  pAnother option that I have found is using the interop.word.range.formattedtext property. This would work well if I was going to go from one word document to another, but I need to somehow get this formatted text over to an excel cell.p  pMy current thought process would be to take the text and put it into a RTF object. Later I would take it and put it into excel by inserting the RTF.text into the cell and use the RTF.format to format each character. This seems like more work than I should have to do.p  pPlease let me know what you all come up withp  pHere is some codep  pSTORAGEp  precodeclass Question      public string text     private Listltstringgt responses      public Questionstring txt, Listltstringgt r              text  txt         responses  r          public Listltstringgt getResponses  return responses   codepre  pPARSINGp  precodeif p lt MAX ampamp docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.ListFormat.ListValue  0       question main line     qTxt  docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.Text.ToString     p      question pos responses NOTE THIS WILL BE USED TO DO MULTIPLE CHOICE LATER     for  p lt MAX ampamp docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.ListFormat.ListValue  0 p              tmp  docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.Text.ToString         if tmp  null ampamp tmp  r             qTxt   rn   docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.Text.ToString       codepre  pSET THE VALUEp  precodeforeach Question question in questionList      ...

Negative 79102 pWhat I currently have is an array of managers with their own rows, and a check box matching up to a day of the week as the column title in row 1.  The check boxes are linked to other cells where they give a value of truefalse with the coinciding days at the top of each column.  p  pColumn A is the managers Unique Identifier the value to lookup,br Column B is the managers name doesnt need to be used for anything in this piece of code,br Columns CI are SundaySaturday check boxes,br Column J is blank,br Columns KQ are the corresponding truefalse values for SundaySaturday.br a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comlYcfx.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlYcfx.jpg altenter image description herea First manager and values start on row 2. Well call that sheet Days Off.p  pOn another sheet, I have a list of agents and their managers Unique identifier, along with some empty spaces for days off each manager can have up to three days off per week so there are three currently blank columns dedicated to this Columns DF.  Column C is where the managers Unique Identifier is that I need to look up on the Days Off Sheet in Column A. Well call this the Report sheet. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxI6t9.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxI6t9.jpg altenter image description herea What I would like to do is have a piece of code that looks for the value from column C on the Report Sheet, finds a match in Column A on the Days Off Sheet, then finds the True Values along that row and returns the Day name at the top of the Column in Column D, E, and F on the Report sheet.  If there are No days off All False, the fields should be left blank, and if there are only two days off the cell in Column F should be left blank.  The first True Value in the row should return to Column D, the Second to Column E, the third to Column F. The values should start filling in on Row 6 and end on the last row with data in column C.p  pI am lost as to how to accomplish this, my VB is weak, so I am hoping someone here can help.p
