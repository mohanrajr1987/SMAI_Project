Positive 4584 pI have two beans class A and class B defined in an XML file. When I start them, the DefaultListableBeanFactory creates the instance of class A first, then the instance of class B.

Why is a variable Int that is uninitialized set to 0 Instead of, for example, 1 I mean, 1 would be more appropriate as it would not collide with SQLqueries, Collectionobjectfetching or stuff like that either  in computer science we usually start counting with 0, so 1 would throw us a more obvious error.p  p2.

Negative 4584 pI know there are a few post out here about selecting records until a certain number is met from the sum of one field but there isnt any that suits me. Im using PHP and MySQL.p  pI have a table named quantity. Inside there are records of product name, product price and product quantity. Besides these, there are a few others that helps me select the last records based on date and position, aswell as a GROUP BY the field named price because there are different quantities with different prices for the same product. So, I currently select my product specific price and quantity like thisp  precodeSELECT price,quantity FROM SELECT price,quantity FROM quantity WHERE productname  DELL ORDER BY date DESC, position AS Actions GROUP BY price codepre  pThis query is a workaround because I need to get data like thisp  precodeproductname       price      quantity  DELL                100         30 DELL                120         10 DELL                130         2 codepre  pasuming that I have multiple records like these and I need to get the latest of them. Anyway, from this query I need to do the following I need to select the records whos quantity summed with another products quantity equals 35. So, by using my query I know that it should stop at line 2 because I can take the 30 products that came with the price of 100 and another 5 products from the line 2 that has price of 120. And then I would need to enter my updates. So, the new data would look like p  precodeproductname       price      quantity  DELL                100         0 DELL                120         5 DELL                130         2 codepre  pHow in the world am I going to achieve this  I hope my details are clear.

Negative 4584 pIm parsing a source file, and I want to suppress strings. What I mean by this is transform every string like bla bla bla  to something like string that is deterministic and does not contain any characters that may confuse my parser, because I dont care about the value of the strings. One of the issues here is string formatting using e.g. s, please see my remark about this below.p  pTake for example the following pseudo code, that may be the contents of a file Im parsing. Assume strings start with , and escaping the  character is done by p  precodeprinti printhello printhello printh e l l o  hellon printhello printstr123h e l l o printuppercaseh e l l og o o d b y e codepre  pShould be transformed to the following resultp  precodeprinti printstring printstringstring printstring string printstring printstr123string printuppercasestringstring codepre  pCurrently I treat it as a special case in the code i.e. detect beginning of a string, and manually run until its end with several subspecial cases on the way. If theres a Python library function i can use or a nice regex that may make my code more efficient, that would be great. p  pFew remarksp  ul liI would like the startofstring character to be a variable, e.g.  vs .li liIm not parsing Python code at this stage, but I plan to, and there the problem obviously becomes more complex because strings can start in several ways and must end in a way corresponding to the start. Im not attempting to deal with this right now, but if theres any well established best practice I would like to know about it.li liThe thing bothering me the most about this suppression is the case of string formatting with the likes of s, that are meaningful tokens. Im currently not dealing with this and havent completely thought it through, but if any of you have suggestions about how to deal with this that would be great. Please note Im not interested in the specific type or formatting of the instring tokens, its enough for me to know that there are tokens inside the string how many. Remark that may be important here my tokenizer is not nested, because my goal is quite simple Im not compiling anything.... li liIm not quite sure about the escaping of the startstring character. What would you say are the common ways this is implemented in most programming languages Is the assumption of doubleoccurrence e.g.  or any set of two characters e.g.  to escape enough Do I need to treat other cases think of languages like Java, CC, PHP, Cli ul  pThanks, Raxp

Negative 4584 pI want to get a value on popup page,  in one textbox, and send it to the parent window, to another textbox.p  pHow to do that p
Negative 4584 pFrom what I understand, the popup exists within its own visual tree. However, Ive noticed a few properties, Clip and ClipToBounds. What I am wanting to do is Visually clip a popup at the right and bottom edges of a window regardless of the fact that the popup is independent of the bounds of the window. Im not using XAML, but if somebody knows how to do it in XAML, then thats fine. I can get to the main window using System.Windows.Application.Current.MainWindow. Is it possible from this to get a value that I can use to clip the popup Im assuming that if there is a value that I can use, then I would be able to bind the clipping of the popup to that value. This is really not necessary since after the popup initially opens, if the window gets moved or resized, the popup closes. So I would really only need to clip the popup when it opens. The reason I would like to do this is because although I am using a popup, I dont want it to appear as a popup that exists outside of the window. FYI this is for a popup calendar for a custom datebox. Any ideas, as well as clarification of misconceptions that I may have, would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4584 pWeve spent the last few months tuning our production application so that we experience no full GCs. We now experience young GCs only, with the rate of young GCs dependent on the rate of object allocation.p  pOur application needs to be as close to realtime as possible so now were trying to reduce the number of young GCs. As the old axiom goes, most of the data we allocate ends up being garbage and discarded at the next young GC. So no need to preallocate for this type of data. However there is a good amount of objects defined by type that we know will make it from young GC to old GC. p  pWould it make sense to preallocate these objects during more ideal times i.e. at startup so well end up allocating less during our lessthanideal times Ive read the literature that mentions how object pooling is not recommended with the latest JVMs because allocation is much cheaper. What are the drawbacks to preallocating objects that I know will make it to the old GCp

Negative 4584 pIn the process of building what Id like to hope is a properlyarchitected authentication mechanism, Ive come across a lot of materials that specify thatp  ol liuser passwords must be saltedli lithe salt used should be sufficiently random and generated peruserli li...therefore, the salt must be stored with the user record in order to support verification of the user passwordli ol  pI wholeheartedly agree with the first and second points, but it seems like theres an easy workaround for the latter.  Instead of doing the equivalent of pseudocode herep  precodesalt  random hashedPassword  hashsalt . password storeUserRecordusername, hashedPassword, salt codepre  pWhy not use the hash of the username as the salt  This yields a domain of salts that is welldistributed, roughly random, and each individual salt is as complex as your salt function provides for.  Even better, you dont have to store the salt in the database  just regenerate it at authenticationtime.  More pseudocodep  precodesalt  hashusername hashedPassword  hashsalt . password storeUserRecordusername, hashedPassword codepre  pOf course, codehashcode in the examples above should be something reasonable, like SHA512, or some other strong hash.p  pThis seems reasonable to me given what little I know of crypto, but the fact that its a simplification over widelyrecommended practice makes me wonder whether theres some obvious reason Ive gone astray that Im not aware of.p  pstrongEDITstrong Some appear to not grok what the question is.

Negative 4584 pIm building a touch screen kiosk application in .NET C, WPF. the app itself is pretty trivial, it just collects user information. p  pBut heres where i am getting out of my comfort zone. The kiosk will be set up at remote locations, so with what I know of web development thats what pays my bills I cant find the kiosk but if I have a central location web server it can find me. When the event the kiosk is used for ends, I need it to upload a list of the users to a central repository. I am guesssing ftp over ssl might work, or since I have control of the app possibly a VPN client on the host machines to tunnel through to the central server, maybe using file sharing. These are just guesses, I am used to the opposite model request from a central server. Any advice to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. I need to implement this in code with limited user interaction. And I have no idea what the architecture of the networks the kiosk can be set up on will be like.p  pThanks in advance, Frankp

Negative 4584 pIn Rails3 there seems to be a problem when chaining two scopes ActiveRelations that each have a different includep  pConsider these two scopes, both of which work fine on their ownp  pFirst scopep  precodescope globalonly, lambda  user includescountry .wherecountries.areaid ltgt , user.area  codepre  pWork.globalonlyuser  cut list of fields from SQL for legibilityp  precodeSELECT  FROM works LEFT OUTER JOIN countries ON countries.id  works.countryid WHERE countries.areaid ltgt 3 codepre  pNow the second scopep  precodescope notbelongingto, lambda  user  includesparticipants .whereparticipants.userid ltgt  or participants.userid is null, user  codepre  pWork.notbelongingtouser  cut list of fields from SQL for legibilityp  precodeSELECT  FROM works LEFT OUTER JOIN participants ON participants.workid  works.id WHERE participants.userid ltgt 6 or participants.userid is null codepre  pSo both of those work properly individually.p  pNow, chain them togetherp  pWork.globalonlyuser.notbelongingtouserp  pThe SQLp  precodeSELECT list of fields FROM works LEFT OUTER JOIN countries ON countries.id  works.countryid WHERE participants.userid ltgt 6 or participants.userid is null AND countries.areaid ltgt 3 codepre  pAs you can see, the join from the second scope is ignored altogether. The SQL therefore fails on no such column participants.userid. If I chain the scopes in the reverse order, then the participants join will be present and the countries join will be lost. Its always the second join that is lost, it seems.p  pDoes this look like a bug with ActiveRecord, or am I doing something wrong, or is this a feature  p  pPS. Yes, I know, I can create a scope that joins both tables and it will correctly yield the result I want. I have that already. But I was trying to make smaller scopes than can be chained together in different ways, which is supposed to be the advantage of activerecord over straight sql.p

Negative 4584 pI am about to spend a lot of time solving a problem, and I wonder if there is an existing recipe for this.  Its a browserbased application JavaScript and Dojo Toolkit that is a client of a RESTful Web Service.p  pIt uses Comet to automatically update the display.  There is a callback function that processes every message received.  [Boring details of Comet  as a sort of background operation, an HTTP request is made to the server.  This request blocks on the server until it has a message for us.  When the client finally receives the response, it calls the callback function and then makes the next HTTP request.

Negative 4584 pIve been using Entity Framework Profiler to test my data access in an MVC project and have come accross several pages where Im making far more db queries than I need to because of N1 problems.p  pHere is a simple example to show my problemp  precodevar club  this.ActiveClub  ActiveClub uses code similar to context.Clubs.First  var members  club.Members.ToList return ViewMembersWithAddress, members codepre  pThe view loops through Members and then follows a navigion property on each member to also show their address. Each of the address requests results in an extra db query.p  pOne way to solve this would be to use Include to make sure the extra tables I need are queried up front. However, I only seem to be able to do this on the ObjectSet of Clubs attached directly to the context. In this case the ActiveClub property is shared by lots of controllers and I dont always want to query the Member and address table up front.p  pId like to be able to use something likep  precodevar members  club.Members.IncludeAddress.ToList codepre  pBut, Members is an EntityCollection and that doesnt have the Include method on it.p  pIs there a way to force a load on the Members EntityCollection and ask EF to also load their Addressesp  pOr, is using EntityCollection navigation properties on an entity in this way, just a really bad idea and you should know what youre loading when you get it from the contextp

This was already done and delivered, strongso far so goodstrong. The result set of query is like thisp  precode  ID  lastupdate            21  20110720 130321   32  20110720 130431   43  20110720 130527   54  20110720 130641   codepre  pThe trouble starts when the user asks me to modify it so the solution so that, eme.g.em, the first time that ID 21 is caught being more than 5 minutes old, the email is sent to a particular set of recipients the second time, when ID 21 is between 5 and 10 minutes old another set of recipients is chosen. So far its ok. The gotcha for me is from the third time onwards the emails are now sent each halfhour, instead of every five minutes.p  pHow should I keep track of the status of Mr. ID  43  How would I know if he has already received an email, two or three And how to ensure that from the third email onwards, the mails are sent each halfhour, instead of the usual 5 minutesp
Negative 4584 pI have an XYPlot on which are series and a couple of dynamically added shape annotations with no fill hence each of the series points are visible.

Negative 4584 pIm building a bubble breakerkinda game. My code uses two 2D arrays, one containing color indexes 1  6 to represent colored circles, and one indicating whether the circle has been selected 1 or 0. I can succesfully select a circle, the right value in the second array changes and this is reflected correctly on screen. p  pThis is the method that selects one circle and four adjacent circles. I pass in the X and Y coordinates that the user has selected on the grid. I set that position to selected from 0 to 1 in the SelectedCircles array. Check whether any of the sides has a circle with the same color, if so, change that circle to selected too.p  precode   private void SelectSurroundingCirclesint xPosition, int yPosition              SelectedCircles[yPosition, xPosition]  1         int colorKey  Circles[yPosition, xPosition]          int increment  1         for int i  0 i lt Nickles.Length i                      if Circles[yPosition  increment, xPosition]  colorKey                 SelectedCircles[yPosition  increment, xPosition]  1  TOP              if Circles[yPosition  increment, xPosition]  colorKey                 SelectedCircles[yPosition  increment, xPosition]  1  BOTTOM              if Circles[yPosition, xPosition  increment]  colorKey                 SelectedCircles[yPosition, xPosition  increment]  1  RIGHT              if Circles[yPosition, xPosition  increment]  colorKey                 SelectedCircles[yPosition, xPosition  increment]  1  LEFT               codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is that all circles of the same color that are next to each other get selected. Basically you first look at the circles adjacent as above, look at their adjacent circles, and so on... I tried various other things but somehow I couldnt figure it out. Hopefully someone can help me, I must be overlooking something.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4584 pMy program downloads mp3 files anywhere from 5MB to 100MB in size, and the memory leak size is the size of the download. The memory usage starts gradually going up after I click the button that pauses or cancels the download. That extra memory nukes itself after it finishes accumulating [filesize] bytes of memory, but I cant figure out whats causing it or how to stop it.p  pWhen I skipcancel the download, I change a state that it checks for so that it exits the download loop and disposes the stream from HttpWebResponse.GetResponseStream.p  pThen the memory usage gradually climbs up, for example for a 20MB download it will climb 20MB doesnt matter if I paused it halfway through the download. It climbs at about the rate it takes for the file to download from the internet. When it hits that amount, it plateaus there if the download has not been resumed from the pause if I canceled the download, it goes back down immediately after reaching that point. When I hit resume on the download, the download restarts itself and as soon as it starts getting data again, the memory usage drops immediately back down to normal. However, either way, it will not get rid of the leak until it has reached that top point.p  pIve tried explicitly disposing everything involved, including the httpwebresponse, and it didnt change anything. It seems like somethings not being closed, or somethings keeping a reference of the stream thats making it accumulate and store stuff in memory while it gets ignored.. Im not sure where to go with this, what else can give me clues. I wish there was like a resource monitor thatd tell me what kind of content is hogging all all the memory.

Negative 4584 pIm wondering if whats described in 1 is supported by the output caching providers that currently ship in the Azure AppFabric SDKp  blockquote   pNormally when a get request fails the client is responsible for   loading the missing data from slow storage e.g. a database, file   server, or remote service and populating the cache. This triples the   number of roundtrips needed for the request and introduces the   possibility for a race condition. With strongReadThroughstrong support turned on   AppFabric itself makes the secondary call to slow storage. AppFabric   gains this ability via a custom implementation of the abstract class   DataCacheStoreProvider.p blockquote  pThe strongWhats Nextstrong section of 3 seems to suggest that its notp  blockquote   pIn addition, the success of the Caching session state provider   scenarios with ASP.NET has resulted in requests for the ability to   associate writebehind and readthrough queries with the cache so that   the cache can become the primary way to manipulate data, while letting   the associated queries update the data tier in the back end.p      pWell be evaluating these and other features for possible inclusion in   future releases of Windows Azure AppFabric Caching. In the meantime,   we encourage you to experiment with the current Caching service   implementation and let us know how it works for you.p blockquote  pIs there any other mechanism for programmatically a invalidating and b replacing a cached page without letting it naturally rehydrate through client requests which can potentially cause issues under load, as all requests race to rehydrate the elementp  pOther documented differences w Windows Server 4p  blockquote   pstrongASP.NET Cachingstrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric provides both a session state provider and an   output cache provider. This provider differs from the one that shipped   with the first release of Windows Server AppFabric. It also provides   additional features. Because of this, it is important to carefully   follow the instructions for modifying the web.config file correctly   for Windows Azure AppFabric. For more information, see Using the   ASP.NET 4 Caching Providers for AppFabric.p      pstrongUnavailable Caching Featuresstrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric supports a subset of the caching features   available in Windows Server AppFabric. The following list describes   some of these differences.p      pstrongNotificationsstrongp      pNotifications are not supported in Windows Azure AppFabric Caching.   This also means that you cannot use notifications to invalidate the   local cache. In Windows Azure AppFabric, local cache can use only a   timeout based invalidation policy. For more information about the   notifications feature in Windows Server AppFabric, see Cache   Notifications Windows Server AppFabric Caching.p      pstrongExpiration and Evictionstrongp      pBy default, items in a Windows Azure AppFabric cache do not expire.   This means that when you exceed your maximum cache size, the least   recently used items in the cache are evicted. Unlike Windows Server   AppFabric, there is no way to change this default expiration setting   or value. However, if you add items to the cache with an explicit   expiration time, such as 10 minutes, then the cache will honor this   expiration value. This can be done with various overloads of the Add   and Put methods. Note that the ASP.NET providers automatically use   these overloads to provide explicit timeouts for session state and   output caching.p      pWindows Azure AppFabric Caching does not support disabling eviction on   a cache. Under memory pressure, it is always possible that items could   be evicted. Applications should be designed to anticipate that items   might be missing and require reloading at any time. If a cache is too   small for the application requirements, it can be dynamically   increased from the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal.p      pFor more information on expiration and eviction in Windows Server   AppFabric, see Expiration and Eviction Windows Server AppFabric   Caching.p      pstrongHigh Availabilitystrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric Caching does not support the high availability   feature. For more information about high availability in Windows   Server AppFabric, see High Availability Windows Server AppFabric   Caching.p      pstrongRegions and Tagsstrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric Caching does not support usercreated regions   or tagbased searches.p      pstrongAPI Supportstrongp      pIn most cases, you can use the same APIs to write cache clients that   use Windows Azure AppFabric or Windows Server AppFabric. There are   some exceptions due to differences between the two solutions.

Negative 4584 pI have been working on this problem for a few days and was hoping someone might have an answer.  I guess the more general description of the problem is that multiple users will access a database from multiple instances of an application and I would like to keep the local copy of the data as current as possible.  This is my current attempt at doing so, but I am open to any way of keeping the local copy in sync with the database.p  pI have two data tablesbr strongdtOriginalstrong is loaded at the start of the application and the user is allowed to edit it.p  pstrongdtFromDbstrong is loaded when the user changes the displayed record on the form and it only contains the current values of the record now being displayed after the change.  p  pI am attempting to update the dtOriginal table with those values from dtFromDb only if the row in dtOriginal is not marked as modified.p  pI have been attempting this with the merge method of the System.Data.DataTable class.p  precodeStronglyTypedDataTable dtOriginal  StronglyTypedDataTableAdapter.GetData  User modifies one record through collectionview...  displayed record is then changed and the following occurs StronglyTypedDataTable dtFromDb  StronglyTypedDataTableAdapter.GetDataByIDcurrentID dtOriginal.MergedtFromDb, true codepre  pI would have expected that any rows which were marked as unmodified would have been updated with any new local values from the database if they had changed in another instance of the program and were propagated back to the database, but this is not the case.  It looks like dtFromDb does get the updated values from the DB, but I must not be using the merge method correctly as the updated values are not propagated to the local copy.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pTylerp

Negative 4584 pI have a service that extracting html code from an URL, converting it to text only with Jsoup and then checks something on the string, and if some conditions are true it launches a notification and writes something to a file.

It takes more than any other process even more than tw launcher and Android System.

Negative 4584 pIm using Ben Almans plugin for hash change trackingp  pa hrefhttpbenalman.comprojectsjqueryhashchangeplugin relnofollowhttpbenalman.comprojectsjqueryhashchangepluginap  pAlso Ive modified my web configuration so that when you enter codewww.mysite.comtest1code, PHP grabs string with emtest1 valueem, forwards it to JavaScript. JavaScript sends it through AJAX to sever side script and brings back emtest1 pageem.p  pAnd after all user writing codewww.mysite.comtest1code in address bar gets the emtest1 pageem. Everything is OK.p  pNow. If you enter codewww.mysite.comcode, you see only index page, and there is a link to emtest1 pageem. If you press it, it makes address codewww.mysite.comtest1code and because of that codecode hash change plugin can bring you back using AJAX when you press back button.p  pWhat I want is to have such hash change plugin or method or system which will not need those codecode signs. Cause I want the user to see the same clean address like codewww.mysite.comtest1code.p  pIs that possiblep
Negative 4584 pIm attempting to generate infinite random terrain. The terrain should generate the same every time given the same seed.p  pIve tried using Javas Random function, creating the seed using various functions of the x and y coordinates of the given node on the terrain grid. Such as xyxyseed, 20x30y etc.p  pThe problem with this approach is that I always see clear patterns in the numbers generated.p  pSo basically what I want is fx,y  Random Numberp  pIt would be helpful if the above function could include a seed of some sort, making it fx,y,seed  Random Numberp  pI will need to generate several numbers for each x,y combination but it should be easy enough to derive additional numbers once I have the above function. These will serve to dictate height of the terrain, and what features buildings, trees will be present.p  pPlease, no mention of Perlin Noise or other such methods. My problem isnt making the noise look good, its getting reliably random noise.p  pThanks, Jamie.p

Negative 4584 pIm a complete beginner to programming and Ive been trying to figure this out for a while but Im lost. Theres a few different versions of the question, but I think I can figure the rest out after I have one finished code, so Im just going explain the one. The first part asks to write a program using a hrefhttpwww.drjava.org relnofollowDrJavaa that will display an image, wait for a user response, and then reduce the image to have only 4 levels per color channel. It goes on to say thisp  pWhat we want to do is reduce each color channel from the range 0255 8 bits to the range 03 2 bits. We can do this by dividing the color channel value by 64. However, since our actual display still uses 1 byte per color channel, a values 03 will all look very much like black very low color intensity. To make it look right, we need to scale the values back up to the original range multiply by 64. Note that, if integer division is used, this means that only 4 color channel values will occur 0, 64, 128 and 192, imitating a 2bit color palate.p  pI dont even get where Im supposed to put the picture and get it to load from. Basically I need it explained like Im five. Thanks in advancep

Negative 4584 pYou can work with Windows Presentation Foundation WPF in OS X without installing a virtual machine with Windows For example, using Wine can run .exe and also creates a virtual registry. I can create other partition on my hard disk using BootCamp and install Windows. I can create a virtual Windows using Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion, but its not native working like another application in OS X running just one OS.p  pWe can work in C using MonoDevelop now XamarinStudio but can not work with WPF.p  pThen, you can install Microsoft Visual Studio on Mac and working with WPF andor Silverlightp

Since I can let the browser first render all the cells and the table is amply wide such that the browser is not trying to compress the cells I get what a comfortable maximum width for all the cells should be.  I want to use that info to now calculate how many cells per row I can draw such that they are all uniformly sized and use all the real estate available to the table.p  pAgain, ultimately, I will begin with a simple array of strings and create a table with cells for as many of the strings as I can comfortably place in the table such that they are all uniformly sized to be the size of the cell holding the widest string.p

Earlier today, I attempted to write a more complicated composite actor, which consists of a number of actors e.g. rectangles, etc.  While visually, this task was successful, I encountered serious difficulties when trying to affix event callbacks to these children actors  in fact, as far as I could tell the events would NEVER reach the children of the parent actor. p  pThis leaves me very confused.  How would one, for example, create a button box using clutter  Would you have to create out your own actor detectionevent management system, or is the only way to connect an event callback to a child actor by adding the child to the stage instead of the actual parentp  pThis had left me very confused and considering the current lack of literature, any help would be greatly appreciated  p

Negative 4584 pI have written an application that essentially sniffs an Ethernet Device, and studies certain patterns. I am using Python and Scapy to capture data. Since the data needs to be captured in a database for posterity, and for pattern studies, we are considering the following strategy.p  p1 We want to use a high performance keyvalue store to capture basic data. This would be fundamentally a a keyvalue store with around 200 keys. 2 Every one hour we will pool the key store, and based on certain conditions and patterns we shall fill up a Postgres Database, based on values stored in KV store. p  pWe are planning to use Redis for the KV. We had considered other solutions including database, files based caches etc, but there are performance bottlenecks. For one there are several thousands of packets that gets processed every minute, and SQL calls back and forth from a database slows down the program.p  pI have never used Redis. But I am told its the fastest and most efficient KV No SQL data store. And the redis python APi makes it very Pythonic.Essentially the database store would have 200 odd keys and a value in long ints associated with 80 of keys, or in some cases, char fields that are less than 200 characters.p  pQuestionsp  p1 Is this is the right approach 2 What are the other parameters to consider 3 How much would the memory scale What all should I do to ensure that memory size is optimized for faster performance 4 How do I calculate memory sizesp  pPython is the only language we know. So any suggestion like CC may not appeal.p  pWe are Ok with a few packets being lost once in a while because the idea is to study patterns rather than come with absolute accurate results. Number of keys would remain the same, and their values can go up and down..p  pWe need finally calculated data to be stored in a RDBMS, because the future mainpulations are SQL intensive. p

Negative 4584 pIn a hrefhttpwww.yesodweb.combookpersistent relnofollowhttpwww.yesodweb.combookpersistenta there is no mention of SQL views.p  pI even in imperative languages have been very fond of immutable database schema design.  i.e. only INSERTs and SELECTs  UPDATEs and DELETEs are not used.p  pThis has the advantage of preserving all history, at the expense of making the current state a relatively expensive pure function of the history in the DB.p  pe.g. there is not a user table, just usercreated, userpasswordupdated and userdeleted tables, which are unified in a user SQL VIEW, showing the current state of users. p  pHow should I work with VIEWs in Persistent  Should I use Persistent at all  is it ironically for Haskell too tightly focused on a mutable DB for my usecasep
Negative 4584 pThe issue is with the SQL query that is used to find computers that the selected user has logged into.  I execute the query, use an adapter to fill the results into a table, and then read the table objects into an array.

Inside the function where the table is read into the array, the contents of the array seem fine just the computer name but when I pass that array out of the function and assign it to a variable, the array has the following data , compName.

Negative 4584 pSay I have a program that contains some data.  Some integer values, e.g. 1, 5, 10, 3.  The program has a GUI that displays the data.  Each integer is converted to string and displayed as a label.  There are several different parts of the program where the data can be changed, e.g. a button that increments a value when clicked.  Each time a value changes the corresponding label must be updated to display the new value.p  pPerhaps a more common senario say we have a control that both changes data and displays data, e.g. a slider bar.  Each time the slider is moved we want the data to change, and be displayed in a label or maybe many different labels.

Also using premultiplied alpha and gl.glBlendFuncGL10.GLONE, GL10.GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAp  pFinally I reset the frame buffer and have my new texture containing the old trails fading and the current fireworks on top drawn at 100 alpha. I then use this texture to draw to my scene together with all the other objects behind and in front of the fireworks texture.p  pAs I said, almost everything is working, except for those almost transparent trails staying after the trails should have faded. The higher the alpha value drawing the previous buffer the more noticable the trail leftovers that stay forever.p  pI have been trying with different blending modes, premultiplied and not premultiplied alpha etc. But since this is an android opengl es 1.1 I think the blending should be GLONE and GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA since all bitmaps are premultiplied by default.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a better way to do thisp  pThanks for any help, Andersp

Negative 4584 pI am new to iPhone app development and have a question about storing data. Ive spent quite sometime learning about core data but still confused about the concept of persistence store.p  pWhat I understand is that core data is just a way of managing the data you downloaded from an external database. But given that core data is backed by SQLite, does that mean there exists a SQLite db inmemory while running If so, does that mean when I use core data it will be more effective if I download a huge data set at start But what about apps such as twitter or Facebook that require constant update of data, is a straight NSURLConnection sufficient in these cases If core data is used, will the extra overheads i.e. data objects be of any burden for such frequent request of updatep  pI would also like to find out some common ways of setting up an online database for iPhone app Is it usually MySQL servers with a homemade Python wrapper that translates the data into JSON Any standard server provider would provide the whole package Or open source code p  pMany many thanksp

Negative 4584 pIve been profiling my app, looking for leaks. It wasnt long until I found some. I am getting multiple leaks from interaction with a UITableView.

Negative 4584 pI have noticed that in order to store a value into the session you simply call      req.session.key  value without the need to specify a callback. I have set mysql as my session storage adapter using the connectmysql module. So I am wondering that consider each time I save a value to the session it is being updated in the db, shouldnt there be a callback associated with this Yet everywhere I look people are happily using it synchronously. Can someone please explain why this is the case THanks.p

A property injector updates this new value in a target view MyView.

Negative 4584 pI have a large termdocument matrix and want to use the nonnegative matrix factorization function matlab offers. The problem is that after the 1st iteration the memory usage rises rapidly and reaches the top my system has 6GB, and on the other hand the CPU usage levels become very low about 15.

Negative 4584 pI created a UserControl that contains a custom ToolStrip Control. While using the UserControl throughout an application, the ToolStrip control cannot be accessed directly, as logically its embedded in the UserControl. So, to access the items of the ToolStrip I defined a readonly property in the UserControl class that returns the items of the ToolStrip. Now programmatically the items of the ToolStrip can be edited by using the UserControl.Items property, but I cannot do the same in the design mode. Like someone drags the UserControl from the ToolBox to the form, goes to the property grid, chooses the Items property and manipulates the items of the ingrained ToolStrip accordingly just as we do with any standard ToolStrip controls items collection with the help of Items Collection Editor. Herein, though the Items property of the UserControl shows in the property grid, its not usable and every time I click, it shows an error message Value cannot be null. Parameter name value. Im sure this is because the property is declared just as readonly and I need to hike more so that when it is clicked in the property grid, the Items Collection Editor pops up with the items of the ToolStrip and can be handled consequently. So how should I be doing this Please state if Im not clear.p  pRegardsp
Negative 4584 pThis is a strongHARDstrong question. In fact it is so hard it seems the SQL standard and most of the major databases out there dont have a clue in their implementation. p  pConverting all datetimes to UTC allows for easy comparison between records but throws away the timezone information, which means you cant do calculations with them e.g. add 8 months to a stored datetime nor retrieve them in the time zone they were stored in. So the naive approach is out.p  pStoring the timezone offset from UTC in addition to the timestamp e.g. timestamp with time zone in postgres would seem to be enough, but different timezones can have the same offset at one point in the year and a different one 6 months later due to DST. For example you could have New York and Chile both at UTC4 now August but after the 4th of November New York will be UTC5 and Chile after the 2nd of September will be UTC3. So storing just the offset will not allow you to do accurate calculations either. Like the above naive approach it also discards information.p  pWhat if you store the timezone identifier e.g. AmericaSantiago with the timestamp instead This would allow you to distinguish between a Chilean datetime and a New York datetime. But this still isnt enough. If you are storing an expiration date, say midnight 6 months into the future, and the DST rules change as unfortunately politicians like to do then your timestamp will be wrong and expiration could happen at 11 pm or 1 am instead. Which might or might not be a big deal to your application. So using a timestamp also discards information.p  pIt seems that to truly be accurate you need to store the local datetime e.g. using a non timezone aware timestamp type with the timezone identifier. To support faster comparisons you could cache the utc version of it until the timezone db you use is updated, and then update the cached value if it has changed. So that would be 2 naive timestamp types plus a timezone identifier and some kind of external cron job that checks if the timezone db has changed and runs the appropriate update queries for the cached timestamp.p  pIs that an accurate solution Or am I still missing something Could it be done betterp  pIm interested in solutions for MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and other DBMS that handle TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE.p

Negative 4584 pWell the title of this question might not actually reflect what I want, I couldnt think of anything better. Maybe I shouldve appended a emand then join two tables acquired this wayem to the end.p  pLets say I have this table. The scenario is, we pay loans with id codeloanidcode, and we store payments of that in the table Payment, each payment has its own codeidcode. When customer pays the payment, we change codepaidcode to code1code.p  precode  loanid  id  amount  paid          1   1    1000     1         1   2    1000     1         1   3    1000     0         2   4   10000     0         3   5   20000     1   codepre  pAnd now we need a report on loans. The output should look like thisp  precode  loanid   paid  remaining          1   2000       1000         2      0      10000         3  20000          0   codepre  pThe codepaidcode column is basically sum of all codeamountcode fields where pay  1. And the coderemainingcode is sum of the codeamountcode rows for which pay  0. They should be grouped by codeloanidcode.p  h2What I triedh2  pI tried different joins, products, etc but the best thing I could get out of my queries was this onep  precodeSELECT loanid, SUMpaid, SUMremaining FROM      SELECT loanid, 0 AS paid, SUMamount AS remaining     FROM Payment     WHERE paid  0     GROUP BY loanid      UNION      SELECT loanid, SUMamount AS paid, 0 AS remaining     FROM Payment     WHERE paid  1     GROUP BY loanid  GROUP BY loanid codepre  pBut I guess there should be better ways than mine.p

Negative 4584 pFirst a little bit context Im writing a little browsergame for practise my webskills and fun  There are users which own some factories and a main depot. These produce different types of products, which are stored in an internal factorydepot. The user can gather the factories to transfer the finished products into their main depot.p  pFor implementation i use PHP with PDO as databaseconnector. My webserver uses a MySQLdatabase and my for debugging i use a local Postgresdatabase.p  pThe user should be able to gather all factories without clicking on the gatherlink and wait for response. Therefore I use Ajax so that the user can click all factories once and wait until all requests are finished. To prevent this parallel access from introduce inconsistency into my database, I use transactions with isolation level SERIALIZABLE. Because pdo doesnt support isolation levels, I send at the connection with my Postgresdb a query withp  precodeSET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE SET statementtimeout10000 codepre  pThe second query should prevent parallel transactions from canceling, while another transaction is in progress. Both queries return no errors, but doesnt work. When I send 8 nearly parallel requests, only 23 of them returns with success, the other returns an error from postgres 25P02 IN FAILED SQL TRANSACTION. While debugging it seems to me, that the transactions doesnt wait for the other to complete, but Im not sure with this.p  pNow my questionsp  ol liAre there any possibilities to get isolation levels and timeouts working with PDOli liAre there any alternatives which i can use except heavyweight frameworks like Zend, i want to explore all mechanics from the deepli liCan I solve my problems if i use only one type of database and a specialiced connector like mysqli I thought its a good idea to use PDO to be more flexible, but maybe its not good for browsergames.li liIs my approach for the databaseaccess ok Or are there better designsli liAre such errors normal and such transactions should be looped until success When yes, with Ajax at clientside or with PHP at serversideli ol

The first allows the use to place a marker on the map at the location that was long clicked and the second gets the address of the location that was long clicked.

if the pointer              count is greater than 1              next thing to look at is if the x and y coordinates of the              persons finger change.             startTimeForLongClick  0  instead of a timer, just reset                                          this class variable and in our                                          ACTIONUP event, the DownTime

Negative 4584 pI have recently discovered that problems with intermittent failures for users running my application using Internet Explorer is due to a bug in Internet Explorer. The bug is in the HTTP stack, and should be affecting all applications using POST requests from IE. The result is a failure characterized by a request that seems to hang for about 5 minutes depending on server type and configuration, then fail from the server end. The browser application will error out of the post request after the server gives up. I will explain the IE bug in detail below.p  pAs far as I can tell this will happen with any application using XMLHttpRequest to send POST requests to the server, if the request is sent at the wrong moment. I have written a sample program that attempts to send the POSTS at just those times. It attempts to send continuous POSTs to the server at the precise moment the server closes the connections. The interval is derived from the KeepAlive header sent by the server.p  pI am finding that when running from IE to a server with a bit of latency i.e. not on the same LAN, the problem occurs after only a few POSTs. When it happens, IE locks up so hard that it has to be force closed. The ticking clock is an indication that the browser is still responding.p  pYou can try it by browsing to a hrefhttppubdev.hitech.comtest.post.phphttppubdev.hitech.comtest.post.phpa. strongPlease take care that you dont have any important unsaved information in any IE session when you run it, because I am finding that it will crash IE.strongp  pThe full source can be retrieved at a hrefhttppubdev.hitech.comtest.post.php.txthttppubdev.hitech.comtest.post.php.txta. You can run it on any server that has php and is configured for persistent connections.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipWhat are other peoples experiences with this issuepli lipIs there a known strategy for working around this problem other than use another browserpli lipDoes Microsoft have better information about this issue than the article I found see belowpli ol  pThe problem is that web browsers and servers by default use persistent connections as described in RFC 2616 section 8.1 see a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2616.txthttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2616.txta. This is very important for performanceespecially for AJAX applicationsand should not be disabled. There is however a small timing hole where the browser may start to send a POST on a previously used connection at the same time the server decides the connection is idle and decides to close it. The result is that the browsers HTTP stack will get a socket error because it is using a closed socket. RFC 2616 section 8.1.4 anticipates this situation, and states, ...clients, servers, and proxies MUST be able to recover from asynchronous close events. Client software SHOULD reopen the transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests without user interaction...p  pInternet Explorer emdoesem resend the POST when this happens, but when it does it mangles the request. It sends the POST headers, including the ContentLength of the data as posted, but it does not send the data. This is an improper request, and the server will wait an unspecified amount of time for the promised data before failing the request with an error. I have been able to demonstrate this failure 100 of the time using a C program that simulates an HTTP server, which closes the socket of an incoming POST request without sending a response.p  pMicrosoft seems to acknowledge this failure in  a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb895954httpsupport.microsoft.comkb895954a. They say that it affects IE versions 6 through 9. That provide a hotfix for this problem, that has shipped with all versions of IE since IE 7. The hotfix does not seem satisfactory for the following reasonsp  ol lipIt is not enabled unless you use regedit to add a key called FEATURESKIPPOSTRETRYONINTERNETWRITEFILEKB895954 to the registry. This is not something I would expect my users to have to do.pli lipThe hotfix does not actually fix the broken POST. Instead, if the socket gets closed as anticipated by the RFC, it simply errors out immediately without trying to resent the POST. The application still failsit just fails sooner.pli ol  pThe following example is a self contained php program that demonstrates the bug. It attempts to send continuous POSTs to the server at the precise moment the server closes the connections. The interval is derived from the KeepAlive header sent by the server.p
Negative 4584 pOkay, so I know this sounds like a very nooby question but I did my best so please hear me out before adding negative commentsdownvoting. br br Okay, so from what my research says, using cURL for my C program when involving anything webrelated is the best way to go. Now, me being new to C, I didnt want to ask questions for every step and try doing it myself, apparently, this was not the case.br br strongProblemstrong CodeBlocks is not recognizing the curl plugin saying it does not exist br br strongGoalstrong br Attempt to make the example source located a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlcsimple.html relnofollowherea from the official cURL website work. br br strongAttempt 1strongbr So, I downloaded the plugin using the help manager where it shows which is the best thing to download. I got the .zip file emcurl7.24.0develmingw32em back. I decided to copy the contents of the bin folder to my projects bin and copy the include folder to my project. It kept saying it did not recognize curlcurl.h or saying it did not exist. br br strongAttempt 2strong br Without deleting the bin and include folder, i decided to move the curl.h folder into my project itself via CodeBlocks by creating a folder called curl and then putting the curl.h inside the folder The folder curl was in the Headers folder created by the program and attempt to run it again seeing that it existed. Same Error br br strongAttempt 3strong br After countless searches, I come across that I should put my curl files and all the files inside the bin folder into CWindows folder. So I copied everything in the includes folder and the contents of the bin folder including the curl folder in it to the WINDOWS folder. Same error. br br strongAttempt 4  Sort of...strongbr Now, there was something about going to my project options and selecting certain files to import and that stuff but it was way more confusing because each site had different options so im unable to do recall the steps. br br Im now relying on the StackOverFlow community to give me a hand. I tried explaining my problem in the most detailed way but if you have any questions or need more information, dont hesitate to ask.

Negative 4584 pI installed OpenCart today on a vm under Linux. On the LAN it works fine.  I opened the port 80 on router but when I try to load my website from external URL, it loads only the text without image and template. Where is the problem Thank youp
Negative 4584 pIn Linux, when a process try to access a page that doesnt have a current physical mapping missing page table entry, a page fault is generated by CPU. This causes Linuxs page fault handler to be invoked. If this fault is major, meaning Linux has to read the page from the swap device, the handler has to read from the actual disk in this case. Since reading from a disk is asynchronous submitbio, does this cause the process to reschedule And wake up when IO is completep  pIf reschedule does happen, where is the call to schedule Reading the code in mmswapstate.c doesnt give me a clue as to when or if this happens.p

Negative 4584 pIm facing this problem while designing my iOS app. Suppose that a user purchases an app and downloads it to the iPhone. I would like to provide him with a default consumable item the first time he runs the app to use whenever he wants , however I would also like to track if the user has already consumed the item. This way if he decides to reinstall the app we can restore the transactions if he used the item or we can avoid possible intents to download different kind of content by reinstalling app and consuming default items each time. Guess NSUserDefaults is not an option here.p  pOne approach that came to my mind was using UDIDor any iOS 6 alternatives to keep a record on server of the users device the moment he uses the default item. But this will limit items just to the device from which they consumed content.p  pIt would be great to support all the users devices like inAppPurchases, but I cant figure out a way to implement this.p  pAny suggestions or help would be great. Thanks a lot. p

Negative 4584 pIm trying to write some basic soundediting programs in Java, but Ive been having a huge amount of trouble with my 16bit WAVE file format.p  pWhen I asked Java how many samples it thought my sound file had, it gave me a number twice as big as I expected. When I told Java to generate a sine wave of a 80000 byte samples, it played for 1 second instead of 2 even though the sample rate was about 40000 per second.p  pAfter some more searching, I realized the the frame size of my file was 2, that a sample was actually 2 bytes instead of one, and that this was called a 16bit audio file. As an experiment, I wrote my sound file to an array of bytes, set every other byte to 0, and played back the result. When I kept only the odd samples, the sound file played back with a tiny bit of static noise. When I kept only the even ones, that static noise played back on its own without the sound file. This makes me think that the even bytes contain the exact inverse of the static in the odd bytes, which contain the actual sound to be played. When played back together, the even bytes silence the static in the odd bytes, which increases the sounds fidelity.p  pa hrefhttphome.roadrunner.comjgglatttechwave.htmPOINTS relnofollow titleThis websiteThis websitea has a pretty good explanation of the basics of 16bit sound encodings. However, its not quite good enough for me to go ahead and start editing the file byte by byte. How can I do bytebybyte editing of a 16bit or larger sound file while still preserving its higher fidelity Whats the formula for encoding sound with 16 bits per sample instead of just 8p

The LayersManager class holds all the layers that the user is currently using think Photoshop layers. The LayersView is a JPanel that lists the layers contained in the LayersManager.p  pWhat I would like to do is to update the LayersView JPanel by adding or removing a LayerComponent from the JPanels container whenever the addLayer or removeLayer methods are called from the LayersManager.p  pIn other words, what I want is a reverse ChangeListener where whenever a change is made in the LayersManager, the LayersView is automatically contacted, adds or removes a LayerComponent from its container and invalidates itself.p  pSo my questions are Is there a standard built in listener to do this Are listeners the right way to go Or should I just include a reference to the LayersView inside the LayersManager and manually call the required methods I suspect this is bad design I cant think of a nice design wise way of implementing my own listeners.p  pAny help appreciatedp

Negative 4584 pIs there a standard container for a sequence of fixed length, where that length is determined at runtime. Preferrably, Id like to pass an argument to the constructor of each sequence element, and use that argument to initialize a const member or a reference. Id also like to obtain the sequence element at a given index in O1. It seems to me that all of my requirements cannot be met at the same time.p  ul liI know a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainerarray relnofollowcodestdarraycodea has fixed length, but that length has to be known at compiletime.li lia hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainervector relnofollowcodestdvectorcodea has dynamic size, and allows passing contructor arguments using a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainervectoremplace relnofollowcodeemplacecodea. Although you can a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainervectorreserve relnofollowcodereservecodea memory to avoid actual reallocations, the type still has to be a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppconceptMoveAssignable relnofollowmovablea to theoretically allow such reallocations, which e.g. prevents const members.li liThen there is a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainerlist relnofollowcodestdlistcodea and a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainerforwardlist relnofollowcodestdforwadlistcodea, which dont require a movable type, but which are still resizable and will perform rather poorly under randomaccess patterns. I also feel that there might be considerable overhead associated with such lists, since each list node will likely be allocated separately.li liStrangely enough, a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppnumericvalarray relnofollowcodestdvalarraycodea is my best bet so far, since it has a fixed length and wont resize automatically. Although there is a a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppnumericvalarrayresize relnofollowcoderesizecodea method, your type wont have to be movable unless you actually call that method. The main deficit here is the lack for custom constructor arguments, so initializing const members isnt possible with this approach.li ul  pIs there some alternative I missed Is there some way to adjust one of the standard containers in such a way that it satisfies all of my requirementsp  hr  pemEditem To give you a more precise idea of what Im trying to do, see this examplep  precodeclass A    void foounsigned n   class B  private   A const a   const unsigned i public   BA aa  aaa, i0     BA aa, unsigned ii  aaa, iii     Bconst stdpairltA, unsignedgtamp args  Bargs.first, args.second     Bconst Bamp  delete   BBampamp  delete   Bamp operatorconst Bamp  delete   Bamp operatorBampamp  delete   void Afoounsigned n     Solution using forwardlist should be guaranteed to work   stdforwardlistltBgt bslist   for unsigned i  n i  0 i     bslist.emplacefrontstdmakepairthis, i  1     Solution by Arne Mertz with single ctor argumen   const stdvectorltAgt ctorargs1n, this   const stdvectorltBgt bsvectorctorargs1.begin, ctorargs1.end     Solution by Arne Mertz using intermediate creator objects   stdvectorltstdpairltA, unsignedgtgt ctorargs2   ctorargs2.reserven   for unsigned i  0 i  n i     ctorargs2.pushbackstdmakepairthis, i   const stdvectorltBgt bsvector2ctorargs2.begin, ctorargs2.end  codepre

Negative 4584 pI appreciate any help, and would like to thank you in advance. Im working on a project for one of my classes. Essentially performing merge sort using multithreading and reference classes. In main Im just trying to create an initial thread that will begin the recursive mergesort.

We just store the temporary order with shipping address as serialized data in db, and after a successful callback from the payment gateway we flag the order as paid, and send orderinfomation to the Dynamics NAV webservice where the real order will get processed. The webshop is on HTTPS. Users can have accounts to view their orders, the orders are also fetched from the Webservice, and not from db.

Negative 4584 pIm trying to get a codeListBoxcode to change its back ground from a codeGridcode to a user selected codeImagecode at the click of a codeButtoncode.  Besides the background, the list box contains a collection of UI elements that are bound to an codeObservableCollectioncode via codeItemSourcecode, and then presented via item presenter.p  pOriginally I had the background XML within the codeListBoxcodes template, and this worked fine up until I needed to put a content presenter in there to give the user the option to selected different back grounds.  p  pThe background updates fine, its just that none of the codeListBoxcode items show up.

Negative 4584 pThis may be an absurd question plus I am unsure how to best Tag it but lets me explain 1st. For the last few months I have regularly had stupid issues with my eclipse project when I have made no changes to anything related to the project That I am aware of. For example, When I finished yesterday Everything worked perfectly, I came in today and suddenly on first run I had a the error codejavax.xml.stream.FactoryFinderConfigurationError Provider com.sun.xml.stream.ZephyrParserFactory not foundcode so I had to add a new dependency to my pom, one I had never needed prior to this error, but this in turned cause another error codejava.lang.LinkageErrorcode if someone has in sight to what is wrong with this specific error, while its not the main question I would love to know. Now I am confident this is completely an environment issue as my team mates are running the same project on there machine with no issue and I even tried redeploying the project currently hosted on the DEV environment which is in working order to my local machinep  pSo What Im asking is is there a way I can create a kind of log of everything that is used or referenced by this project each time it is run successfully, and when I say everything I refer to things like changes to Maven config, weblogictomcat, java patches, eclipse plugins, OS patches windows 7 in mycase, build paths, project configs.... basically anything eclipse would use to build and deploy the project p  pI realize the list is most likely massive, but if it was possible to do this on each run or as an extra flag or something then it wouldnt be too difficult to compare the log of a successful run with that of a non successful run this could later be automatedp  pAs I said This may be absurd but if possible it would be a very useful tool. p
Negative 4584 pIm quite green on CSS but Im building a webpage and after a lot of searching and coding Ive come quite far in browser compability. But there is a big difference in how my Androidphone renders the webpage if you compare to the other major browsers. It looks like thisp  pa hrefhttpneobux.se1.jpg relnofollowhttpneobux.se1.jpga and 2.jpgp  pAs you can see, its slightly better in landscape view. Since the margin expands in landscape view Im guessing it got to have something to do with either my sidhuvudvanstercontainer or sidhuvudhogercontainer which both have width50.

Negative 4584 pI want my iOS app to follow the common pattern of having a main view where signing up or signing in is required to access the app, so if it is the first time the app is run in the device or the user is not logged in, that is the view displayed, and another app view is displayed otherwise. Sign up and Sign in buttons in main view may navigate to the corresponding forms, or they may show them modally. Once the user access the app, it should be tab based, similarly to Twitter app. p  pMy question is what should be my coderootViewControllercode A codeUINavigationControllercode where to push the main view if there are no users credentials, and the codeUITabBarControllercode if there are Or should I set the coderootViewControllercode dynamically in the app delegate depending on having credentials or notp  pThanks p
Negative 4584 pI am creating a native app for android using sencha touch 2.2.1p  pI want to integrate the feature of social media sharing Facebook and Twitter.p  pThe idea is ,there will be list of images and few buttons under each image. When the user clicks on the share button, Facebook and Twitter icons will popup and if user click on facebook, than that particular image will get posted on users wallif heshe is already logged in, otherwise will open facebook login window. Same will happen for Twitter.p  pI am able to implement this thing with sencha webapp. Becuase on the webapp, facebook is getting its fallback url and it posted the image successfully. But when I created an apk of my application then the sharing code is not working.p  pIt is showing error  URL not allowed........ I think it is an issue of fallback url.  I used facebook sdk also but it did not work for me. I also tried with combination of sencha Touch and Phonegap but still the same error as mentioned above. p  pPlease share if anybody implemented similar to this type of project. p

Negative 4584 pwe have an svn with several php applications in it not depending from each other, with different versions.p  pThe problem I have, is that I dont know where to store the config files and how to make them accessible to the applications.

Though, sometimes cell 3 has more content  so much that it requires more height than 1 and 2, so the other cells get stretched out. That means there will be a large empty area in the bottom of cell 1.p  pSo, I want cell 1 to have always the minimum weight, so if cell 3 stretches out the table, the extra space will place itself in the bottom of cell 3.

Negative 4584 pI am implementing a health bar that animates via user input. p  pThese animations make it go up or down by a certain amount say 50 units and are the result of a button press. There are two buttons. Increase and Decrease.p  pI want to execute a lock on the health bar so that only one thread can change it at a time. The problem is Im getting a deadlock.p  pIm guessing because a separate thread runs a lock that is held by another thread. But that lock will give way when the animation completes. How do you implement a lock that ends when [UIView AnimateWithDuration] completesp  pI wonder if codeNSConditionLockcode is the way to go, but I want to use NSLocks if possible to avoid unnecessary complexity. What do you recommendp  pEventually I want to have the animations queue up while letting user input continue, but for now I just want to get the lock working, even if it blocks input first.p  pHmm come to think of it there is only one [UIView AnimateWithDuration] running at a time for the same UIView. A second call will interrupt the first, causing the completion handler to run immediately for the first. Maybe the second lock runs before the first has a chance to unlock.

Negative 4584 pAlright, so Im pretty new to Spring, but I was asked to resolve a bug. So in our application, we have a page that queries a database based on an id. However, not all entries are unique to the id. The id and date pair, on the other hand, do define unique entries. p  pSo this page takes in an id. If there is only a single entry related to this id, everything works fine. However, if there are multiple entries, the page displays a radio button selection of the various dates that pertain to that id. We use something like p  blockquote   plt formradiobutton idloadDate pathloadDate valuedate labeldate p blockquote  pLater on the same page, we want to display the data for that option. As part of it, we display the date of that selection p  blockquote   plt forminput idaiLoadDate pathloadDate maxlength22 size22 classreadonly readonlytruep blockquote  pThe problem is that when this happens, the variable or bean Im not quite sure about Spring yet.. loadDate a string ends up being the same date twice, seperated with a comma. Im guessing the problem here is the pathloadDate that is common to both lines. p  pInstead of appending the date to the already existing one like a csv, Id like it to overwrite the current entry intead. Is there a way to do this p

Negative 4584 pI have a WP7 app that uses a SQLite database. A feature of the app is backing up to SkyDrive, which works fine, but afterwards my app throws the unable to open database file. If I wait a bit anywhere from 10 to 60 seconds itll start working again.

Negative 4584 pI have problems dealing with thousand of data. The scenario is looping through a collections Vector. with more than 40000 objects and draw only the items that dont overlap each other At the moment I do  I divide the area where I can draw in squares a Vector. contains  all the points indentifying the squares  for each item in Vector. I loop through the squares to figure out wich area the item belongs to  I draw the first item in Vector. and I add the drawn item to a Vector. of drawn items  for all the remains items I check if the item I have to draw overlaps the items already drawn in the belonging area looping through the Vector. of drawn items  if it doesnt overlap I draw it and add it to the Vector. of drawn items, if it overlaps I dont draw it.br To speed up the looping Im using dictionary and vector, Im declaring all the variable outside the loop and Im also using the Duffs device for actionscriptbr My problem is the loop is still quite slow about 9 seconds.

Negative 4584 pIve been making a text adventure game in C to learn more about strings and such. I have about 3 random scenarios that are triggered after the 10 basic ones where you start.

Negative 4584 pHi everyone First time posting on stackoverflow.p  pI was wondering if there was a wayhow to stop the size of a container shifting when a scrollbar is added to itp  plike, if I take a div and slap codeoverflowyscrollcode into its style, it adds a nice and nifty scrollbar, but aligns all the dynamically positioning content inside of it to the left a little bit because the scrollbar changes the actual size of the content areap  pIm not great with web dev vocabulary, but I hope you understand what I mean.p  pI found that on iOS, adding codeoverflowyscrollcode also doesnt physically add a scroll bar and doesnt change the size of the container all of the stuff inside of it stays centeredp  pBut if I add a scroll bar to a div with items inside of it positioned to a relative percentage, the size of the container will change and therefore all the content will movep  ptldr how do I keep my stuff in the dead center even after I add a scroll barp  pI was thinking making it statically positioned but I want the horizontal height to stay relative can I specify a static position for the x but not the yp  pthanks.p

Negative 4584 pI am developing an application where I am streaming live sensor data via bluetooth, then have several Activities that can work on this live stream of data to display it in different ways e.g. statistics, histogram, trend charts etc.p  pI need to maintain the bluetooth link across Activities, and I also need to maintain receiving the data into a buffer across Activities e.g. you can be viewing the data in the trend chart activity, then hop across into a statistics Activity without it clearing the data.p  pHow Ive done it is to extend application and have it hold a custom class which holds all the relevant Bluetooth objects bluetooth device, IOstreams.  Then when the user initiates the connection through the front page Activity, the bluetooth connection is opened and a service is started that reads the data from the input stream, converts it and stores it into a arraylist. Then any of the display Activities work on this ArrayList.p  pThat works great.  But I cant work out how to close the bluetooth connection and service when the application is either killed, or placed into the background.  As its important to ensure the bluetooth connection is closed properly, or else it can be difficult to reestablish a connection.p  pAbout the best Ive come up with so far is to implement a task transition timer as described in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma155731213015368httpstackoverflow.coma155731213015368a, and have it close the connection and service if the timer completes.p  pI was hoping there might be a better way of doing thisp

Negative 4584 pIm developing a web app where a user can request a service and a provider will be available to respond to him. So, When a user requests for some sort of service, our application will send a notification to the provider asking him to respond to the user. What Im trying to do is when a user requests a service, the provider gets the notification instantly something like facebook does.p  pOne way to get this is using AJAX to send requests to the server every 510 secs what we call is polling so far i know.

Negative 4584 pI stuck at somewhere in dependency injection and oAuth 2.0 tokens. I have a service layer underneath my asp.net mvc5 web application.

Negative 4584 pI am wandering for seven hours for solving my issue. I have created project in which i m using strongemGLSurfaceViewemstrong on which i have set one image and after that i have implement different effects on it using strongemEffectFactoryemstrong class. p  pBut my Problem is when i have taken a screen shot with effected image it always shows as a black screen instead of with image. I know that may be its because of strongemSurFaceviewemstrong. But If any suggestion which might be helpful for me.p  pThanks in Advance.p  pHere is my code.p  precodepublic class EffectsFilterActivity extends Activity implements     GLSurfaceView.Renderer

Negative 4584 pI work in project in WPF which uses Entity Framework with SQL Server. The optimalization there is crap. Everything is too slow.

By those information I will be able to find bugs.p  pI want to measure about 100 methods which have selects from db in many classes.

It then creates a new workbook for each unique number regardless of the date selected.p  pAny help would be absolutely amazing I have been struggling with this for over a weeks now. p  pMy code is,p  precodeWith WorkbooksInvoicing.xlsm.Sheetssheet1          .AutoFilterMode  False         If Me.ComboBox2.Value ltgt vbNullString Then         .RangeA2W26.AutoFilter Field20, Criteria1Me.ComboBox2.Value          For i  LBoundmyarr To UBoundmyarr         .AutoFilterMode  False         .RangeA2W26.AutoFilter Field1, Criteria1myarri         .AutoFilter.Range.EntireRow.Copy  Set wbNew  Workbooks.Add wbNew.Worksheets1.Paste  WorkbooksInvoicing.xlsm.SheetsInvoice Template.RangeA1R83.Copy  wbNew.Activate Worksheets.AddAfterWorksheetsWorksheets.Count.Name  Current Invoice  wbNew.SheetsCurrent Invoice.RangeA1.PasteSpecial PastexlPasteAll,  OperationxlNone, SkipBlanksFalse, TransposeFalse       Dim s As Integer     s  2      Dim t As Integer     t  21    WorkbooksInvoicing.xlsm.SheetsClient Information.Activate       Do Until IsEmptyCellss, 3     Period  Cellss, 21.Value     If Period  ComboBox2.Value Then      Dim wsInvoice As Worksheet     Set wsInvoice  wbNew.SheetsCurrent Invoice          wsInvoice.Cellst, 2.Value  Cellss, 10.Value    Volumes         wsInvoice.Cellst, 3.Value  Cellss, 8.Value     Benefits         wsInvoice.Cellst, 7.Value  Cellss, 11.Value    Rates         wsInvoice.Cells8, 2.Value  Cellss, 14.Value    Insurer Name         wsInvoice.Cells9, 2.Value  Cellss, 16.Value    Insurer Address         wsInvoice.Cells13, 2.Value  Cellss, 3.Value    Client Name         wsInvoice.Cells14, 2.Value  Cellss, 4.Value    Client Address         wsInvoice.Cells10, 9.Value  Cellss, 1.Value    Policy Number         wsInvoice.Cells11, 9.Value  Cellss, 22.Value   Renewal Date         wsInvoice.Cells12, 9.Value  Cellss, 20.Value   Anniversary Date      With wsInvoice     Select Case Cellss, 9         Case 1001  Formula for Life, AD amp D, ASI, CI             Prem  .Cellst, 2  .Cellst, 7  1000         Case 1103  Formula for LTD             Prem  .Cellst, 2  .Cellst, 7  100         Case 1104  Formula for STD             Prem  .Cellst, 2  .Cellst, 7  10         Case 2112  General Formula             Prem  .Cellst, 2  .Cellst, 7     End Select      .Cellst, 9.Value  Prem     End With      With wsInvoice     Select Case Cellss, 15         Case 5501 Commission schedule          Case 5502 Commission schedule           Case 5503 Commission schedule              FrontL  1             HBack  0         Case 5504 Commission schedule           Case 5505 Commission schedule           Case 5506 Commission schedule              FrontL  1             HBack  0         Case 5507 Commission schedule              FrontL  1             HBack  0         Case 5508 Commission schedule              FrontL  1             HBack  0         Case 5509 Commission schedule           Case 5510 Commission schedule           Case 5511 Commsion Schedule              FrontL  0.9             HBack  0.1         Case 5512 Commission schedule              FrontL  0.9             HBack  0.1         Case 5513 Commission schedule              FrontL  0.8             HBack  0.2         Case 5514 Commission schedule              FrontL  0.9             HBack  0.1             Comm  0.06         Case 5515 Commission schedule              FrontL  0.9             HBack  0.1             Comm  0.1     End Select      .Cells38, 8.Value  FrontL     .Cells39, 8.Value  HBack     .Cells18, 4.Value  Comm     End With          t  t  1       End If       s  s  1      Loop  End With    Next I  End Sub  returns an array of unique values within a specified range Private Function uniqueValuesInputRange As Range Dim cell As Range Dim tempList As Variant tempList   For Each cell In InputRange     If cell.Value ltgt  Then         If InStr1, tempList, cell.Value  0 Then             If tempList   Then tempList  TrimCStrcell.Value Else tempList  tempList amp  amp TrimCStrcell.Value         End If     End If Next cell uniqueValues  SplittempList,  End Function codepre

Negative 4584 pI have an algorithm that calculates components bytes of a vector out of order. Im storing the vector in a file, since when I run this for real the vector will be millions of bytes long. But as a simplified example Id like to start with an empty filep  p1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 p  pThen my algorithm will fill in two values at a timep  p1 1 4 7 1 1 1 1 p  pthenp  p1 1 4 7 1 1 3 9p  petc. until all the values have been filled in. Is this possible to do Ive tried using random access files, but when you use the seek method it fills in 0s for all values before the ones I want to edit, deleting any previous calculations my algorithm has done. Since I need this program to work on large sequences of numbers, pulling the whole file into memory is not an option. Any ideas p

Negative 4584 pVery often, I have to use multiple libraries that handle errors differently or define their own enums for errors.  This makes it difficult to write functions that might have to deal with errors from different sources, and then return its own error code.  For examplep  precodeint dofooandbar      int err     if err  libfoodosomething lt 0           return err and indication that it was caused by foo          if err  libbardosomething lt 0           return err and indication that it was caused by bar           ...     return 0  codepre  pIve thought of two possible solutionsp  ul liCreate my own list of error codes and translate these error codes to new ones, using functions like codeint translatefooerrorint errcode, and I would write my own string representations for each error.li liCreate a codestruct myerrorcode that holds both an enum identifying the library and the error code.  The translation to string would be delegated to an appropriate function for each library.li ul  pThis seems like a problem that would come up very often, so Im curious, how is this usually handled  It seems like the former is what most libraries do, but the latter is less work and plays on the tools already provided.  It doesnt help that most tutorials just print a message to stderr and exit on any error.  Id rather have each function indicate what went wrong, and the caller can decide from that how to handle it.p

Negative 4584 pI am using Grails 2.3.11. With the application Grails web flow is used.p  pThe flow is there are four tabs, which will be treated as steps for Grails web flow. Clicking on a step it will go to listsearch page. The first initial search will have default search parameter values. And at the same time it stores to the scope of executions active sessions scope.p  pHere is the code snippet.p  pcodeObject res  execution.getActiveSession.getScope.putbeanID, beancodep  pHere codeexecutioncode is a reference of codeFlowExecutioncode.p  pLater on this object is been retrieved using active session itself. Below is the code snippet to retrieve data.p  pcodeObject objectFound  execution.getActiveSession.getScope.getbeanIDcodep  pIn both the case codebeanIDcode is same.p  pNow what happen to this is, when I put it to the active session, it does not gives error so assuming it is been saved properly. But on retrieving the object in another ajax request, retrieval of object gives null. Means no object found with the key.p  pThen strange thing happen is, when I perform search operation, same operation been performed as mentioned above. Now on retrieving with the same key it gives object back and not getting null value.p  pMy query is why this is happening How the web flow works in this casep  pI think in both the cases it should give back the object against the key with which it is been inserted.p  pLet me know if require more information about the query.p

Negative 4584 pOn a website I have some scripts which work on a temporary database. Before the scripts are starting I drop and recreate the temporary database from the production database.

I have approximately 30 table but only around half of them are modified by the scripts, so it would be great if I can limit the tables to work on.

Negative 4584 pI am doing a fun little project, making a kind of secret code program with a GUITkinter to encrypt my textnot very securely. I am trying to make a password on this program linked to a txt file. The program has default password abc, stored in a text file in sha224. When the user enters abc, it will hash their input in sha224, and compare it to the stored password in hexutf2.txt. Once they have logged in, the user will have the option to choose a new password by clicking New Passcode, entering their previous passcode, clicking next, and then clicking new code. After clicking new code, the user enters a new passcode in the entrypassVariable, then clicks enter passcode, which will write the new passcode on the txt file. Instead, the program hangs on the first pressing of Enter passcode, despite the fact that I had entered abc the default passcode. The program worked before I added the password element, so I will post only the password code here, but I will link to the entire program if anyone wants to see it.p  pstrongemEDITemstrongp  pPosting just the essential code here.

Negative 4584 pUsing Swift, I want to write a protocol that specifies that implementing classes must have a function that takes an enum which adheres to a given protocol, where that enum type is specified generically. Ive tried thisp  precodeprotocol Message   protocol Subscriber    func receiveltT where TMessagegtmessageT   enum Greeting  Message    case Hello, Goodbye   class SomeObject  Subscriber    func receiveltGreetinggtmessage Greeting      switch message      case .Hello       printlnHello     case .Goodbye       printlnGoodbye          codepre  pThis fails to compile with the message Enum case pattern cannot match values of the nonenum type Greeting at each of the case lines. This would appear to be because the Subscriber protocol expects something that is no more specialized than Message, but I set things up in terms of Greeting, which though it implements Message, is more specialized. Am I rightp  pSo, how do I do what Im attempting to do, pleasep
Negative 4584 pI made an usual 3level ExpandableListView based on the many examples on the internet and it works well.p  pWith one caveat.  Clicking on the 2nd and 3rd level does not work always. Although sometimes it works fine. Usually at start it works everywhere. Then it does not work anymore, on like 50 of the items. Without any logic. Sometimes I expand a 2nd group and then I cannot collapse that group anymore. Or sometimes I expand a 2nd group and then I cannot collapse any other group of the 2nd level.  The only consistent thing is that it often gets fixed by scrolling the locked up view out of the visible area and back in. p  pWhat could be going onp  precode    public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.chooselib          ...

an item to the outer list view, and changing descand focusability did not change anything. since only textviews are in the list they are not focusable anyways. And nothing useful in the logcat, toop  pWhat I do not really understand of the source I based on is the stuff in onMeasure. And the split between the groups and children of the listviews. Perhaps it is better to have an expandable list view for every group on the 1st level, instead one for every group on the 2nd levelp

Negative 4584 pIm trying to enable push notifications through parse. The parse notification code works if there is already a user cached and signed into the app. If I logout and try to signup a new user, however, the app crashes and I get an error that states NSInvalidArgumentException, reason Cant use nil for keys or values on PFObject. Use NSNull for values....I believe the issue is with the didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken method within the app delegate. Because there isnt a currentUser logged in, when the app tries creating a PFInstallation, all of the associating fields are returning nil. I have tried an if statement checking for a currentUser before running the PFInstallation code, but the app still crashes. I need to register for notifications after signup occurs, but I cant figure out how to do that seeing as didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken needs to occur in the app delegate.

Negative 4584 pI have read on a lot of sites that for iPhone 6 Plus the image asset needs to be three times as big as the actual image, so it therefor needs to be a 3x image. And then 2x is for iPhone 6 all the way down to iPhone 4 and then just the original size for iPhone 3GS and below.p  pMy main question is that am I right in saying this and if so, what if Apple changes the iPhones screen size again one day, will they make developer make a 4x image too I just think its getting a bit out of hand.p  pWhat is the best way to sort all this image sizes out Do you just make all the image assets for your app 3 times as big when you are designing them and then make a smaller 2x and 1x version of themp  pThanks for your time, Dan.p

Negative 4584 piIll gladly post code if someone can point out how to paste it in here without using the 4 space indentation system that doesnt workip  pHello folks After 9Hours racking by brains, I cant find an answer or find where my calculations are going wrong... but they are. I have a circuit built using a microchip 18F2550 microcontroller. I am using this circuit to measure the delay between 2 signals and am using the 2 CCP registers in capture mode. This all works and the result is sent to the PC over USB serial all dandy, but the results are wrong. I have to apply a gain of 16000 to any results to get somewhere near the delay presented to the pins.p  pI have the delay set in the linebr Timer1 is set as an internalbr Timer3 is disabledbr relevant interrupts are enabledbrp  pand the main routine runs continuously. When I get a rising edge detection on the CCP1 pin, the interrupt is configured to reset timer1 to zero as well as the overflow counterp  precode    INTCCP1     void ccp1isr  Captures the rising edge of CCP1 pin.               iftimingFALSE  only do this on the edge, any bouncing will reset timers etc.             settimer10             T1Overflow  0             PulseTime  0             timing  1      Set flag to indicate timing.             outputhighBLUELED               codepre  pthe codetimingcode flag ensures the times cannot be reset by another pulse on the CCP1 pin. Timer1 should then be reset and start counting as normal.  Every time it rolls around by 65535 16bit device another interrupt is fired after which the amount of overflows are incremented.p  precode    INTTIMER1     void isr              T1Overflow      codepre  pFinally, when the input pin on CCP2 goes high, the CCP2 interrupt is triggered.  This captures the value of the CCP register which is the value of Timer0 at the time the interrupt was fired and the overflow register.p  precode    INTCCP2     void ccp2isr                                  iftiming  TRUE  only output this when preceded by CCP1             ifCountDone  FALSE  do this once only                              CountDone  TRUE   and also flag to the main routine to output data to the terminal.                 Pulsetime  CCP2                 PulseOverflow  T1Overflow                 measureCount      increment the number of measures.                          outputlowBLUELED             timing  FALSE               codepre  pCCP1 can now start responding to the inputs again. The idea of this is that every time I get a pulse of one input at CCP1 followed by CCP2, a string is sent to the terminal with a counter, the number of overflows and the time left in the timer.p  precode    whileTRUE                         do forever while connected                    usbtask                           keep usb alive            ifCountDone  TRUE                    printfusbcdcputc, lu , lu ,  lu rn,measureCount, pulsetime, pulseoverflow            CountDone  FALSE         codepre  pso, I should get an output to the terminal of something like 1,61553,35 for a 12ms delay between CCP1 and CCP2. The problem is that these are the results I am getting for a 200ms pulse provided to the circuit. Verified twicep  pso where am I going wrong. I have a 48MHZ Clock with no prescaler which implies a cycle every 20ns. Divide by for 4 instructions per cycle for the clock which implies 5.2ns every cycle 16 bit timer which implies rollover every 655355.2ns  341us per rollover. when you do the calculations 0.000341pulseoverflowpulsetime5.2109 then the above data gives 0012.27ms and not the 200ms provided.p  pCan anyone point out where I am going wrong with these calculationsp

Negative 4584 pI have a simple VOIP type of app, that can be configured with and without echo canceling.  When using echo cancel, obviously Im using the VoiceProcessingIO unit.  Everything works great when configured that way, except of course the latency is a bit too long.p  pIf the user is using a headset with microphone, we give them an option to disable echo canceling, which switches to using the RemoteIO unit.  Obviously Id expect some acoustic echo from the device, but not nearly as much as I am getting.p  pIt turns out, that when using the RemoteIO unit, that IOS itself is feeding the output speaker data to the microphone input data Why in the heck would it do this  We effectively disabled the headset microphone on the remote unit, and still get substantial echo.p  pIts not a shared buffer problem, since we render the mic audio into a different AudioBufferList than the playback audio.

And, whenever possible, with some performance as Im holding the actors type in the logger.log class to know which relational table Ill have to query, instead of querying all the relational tables and then computing only the one record from the one only table that holds it.p  pFinally, I did used so many relational tables as I need the data layer and not the logic one to enforce the constraints between the log table and the many different actors external tables.p  pHope I explained the situation, thank you very muchp
Negative 4584 pIm learning assembly now and I dont get one thing about the presumably standard function template.p  pSo, based on a hrefhttpeu.wiley.comWileyCDAWileyTitleproductCd0764579010.html relnofollowthis really nice booka, emthe form to remember for functions is as followsemp  precodefunctionlabel     pushl   ebp     movl    esp, ebp     lt normal function code goes heregt     movl    ebp, esp     popl    ebp     ret codepre  pOK, Im perfectly fine with it, but there is one small thing that I dont understand. After the normal function code we restore the initial precall value of codeespcode, which was previously stored in codeebpcode. p  pNow, I understand it clearly why we want to serve the codeespcode value back to the calling context untouched. What I do not understand is under which conditions the codeespcode value can be changed at all during the functions execution. p  pIs it some kind of protection against ourselves in case we somehow corrupt the stack somewhere in our code included in this template Or maybe changing stack values inside a function is a normal practice Or it is possible that the initial codeespcode value may end up changed during execution even if we dont do anything with it I cant figure out how this can be, in fact.p  pI felt rather silly while thinking about this and checked the codeespcode value with codegdbcode in this simple codep  precode.section .data message     .asciz gt Hello from function dn  .section .text .globl main  main     nop     call    overhere     pushl   0     call    exit overhere     pushl   ebp     movl    esp, ebp     pushl   1     pushl   message     call    printf     add     8, esp     movl    ebp, esp     popl    ebp     ret  codepre  pAnd codeespcode as I actually expected was untouched, so moving codeebpcode to codeespcode didnt actually change anything. p  pNow, I hope that its clear what I want to find outp  ul liCan codeespcode value eventualy change by itself I would bet it cant.li liIf it cant, then this template above, obviously, assumes that the programmer might change it somehow inside the function. But I cant figure out why on Earth one might need to do that, so  is changing codeespcode value a mistakeli ul  pThank you in advance and excuse my ignorance.p

Negative 4584 pIn C often structs are typedefed to avoid writing struct everywhere.p  pWhen using this names as opaque pointer parameters in headers you have to forward declare them.

But to avoid huge include dependencies BlaBlaFooBar.h should not be included and just a forward declaration is used.p  pSo you have to write codetypedef struct sBlaBlaFooBar BlaBlaFooBarcode to forward declare it.p  pThat does bother me is the redundancy that i have to know the tag name of the structure because normally it does not matter.

Negative 4584 pWhile delving into CSS units Ive encountered a definition of the reference pixel.

I fully understand the purpose of introducing the second one, but I find its nomenclature misleading.

[a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS21syndata.htmllengthunits1a]p blockquote  pThe above statement seems pretty obvious for every unit except for the pixel. Following the w3c specificationp  blockquote   pFor a CSS device, these dimensions are either anchored i by relating the physical units to their physical measurements, or ii by relating the pixel unit to the reference pixel.p      p... Note that if the anchor unit is the pixel unit, the physical units might not match their physical measurements. Alternatively if the anchor unit is a physical unit, the pixel unit might not map to a whole number of device pixels. [a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS21syndata.htmllengthunits1a]p blockquote  pConsidering the aforementioned quotation I assume that absolute units are not all that absolute, since they may be anchored to the reference pixel. p  hr  h21.2 The reference pixelh2  pThe reference pixel itself is actually an angular measurement [a hrefhttpwww.inamidst.comstuffnotescsspx2a]p  blockquote   pThe reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arms length.

Negative 4584 pIm having some issues grokking how Angular UI Router nested views work.p  pMy stateProvider looks like thisp  precodestateProvider .statelogin,    url login,   views      main          templateUrl statictemplateslogin.html,         controller LoginCtrl          .statedashboard,      url dashboard,     controller DashboardCtrl,     views          main              templateUrl statictemplatesdashboard.html,         ,         content               templateUrl statictemplatespartialsdashboardcontent.html,             controller DashboardContentCtrl                codepre  pMy goal here is to load in the dashboard.html template dynamically this works.  But after that, populate the content uiview with dashboardcontent.html.p  pstrongdashboard.htmlstrongp  precodeltdiv classspan3gt    lt A bunch of plain html gt ltdivgt ltdiv classspan9 uiviewcontentgtltdivgt codepre  pMy index file that loads the whole app has a uiview named main, which seems to be working fine.  I need this to work because dashboardcontent.html contains menu items that will need to be available across the logged in site.  Only items in the content uiview will be changing significantly.  Anything else will just have something simple like an active class applied to a link.p

Negative 4584 pI think Im missing some basic aspect of ggvis  shiny. p  pFollowing the tutorials, plots are constructed in server.R using a series of  pipes, ending with bindshiny, which associates the plot with an identifier that can be referred to in ui.Rp  pWhat I dont get though is that the plot itself is not reactive in the way that code within renderTable, renderText or reactive will be. So if I want to refer to an input parameter like inputx in defining the plot, it wont work, Ill get an error saying codeOperation not allowed without an active reactive context. You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.code.p  pFor example, if input is the input parameter to the shinyServer function, I might have a plot that looks likep  precodedataframe gt ggvis aval,  bval gt layerpoints gt layerpathsx  xv, y   yv, data  data.framexv  c0, 0, yv  c0, inputmaxValParam codepre  pwhere layeRpoints is used to plot data in dataframe and layerpaths is being used to draw a vertical line up to the maxValParam value.p

It should also not be possible to run or even schedule run of this manual job if those other jobs are running. p  pI searched for the answer everywhere and checked every possible plugin that serves synchronization. But I did not figure it out how to solve the above problem. p
Negative 4584 pI have a database with 4 tables filled with millions of rows. I have my program run on several computers computing data and then returning it to the database. The huge bottleneck in my program design is that for each calculation, it has to download the data and then perform calculations on it and then save the results to the database. When I had the data on the local network it performed with crazy speed so I realize that the resources to download the data from a remote server is the problem. p  pWhat are some ways I can save data from the remote database either before or after my code runs so I can make my program more efficient. These calculations are done once and arent needed again and I have 24 computers running this same program.p  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args              try

Now the backing data for the table was coming from a webservice call that was returning a xml. Now Flexigrid has a URL property that can be set to indicate this and so it was easy to wire up the grid there.p  pWhat needs to changep  pCurrently due to performance issues i am planning to change to SlickGrid. But i cant find a way where i can bind the table to the result of the webservice call. i want the SlickGrid grid to update itself based of off the latest result from the web service url. p  hr  pEDIT  So now i have written a jquery ajax call to get the xml data from the web service. Now the question facing me is how do i get the slickgrid to render itself as per the xml data .p  pAppreciate the help.p

Negative 4584 pIn a nutshell, codeSOREUSEPORTcode socket option allow to create multiple sockets on ipport pair. For example, codeprogram1code and codeprogram2code both can call functions chain codesocketgtbindgtlistengtacceptcode for the same port and IP, and kernel scheduler will evenly distribute incoming connections between this two programs.p  pI assumed that with this option, you can get rid of the use of codeforkcode for spawning additional workers and can simply run new program instance.p  pI wrote a simple epoll socket server, based on this logic, and test it with weighttpp  pcodeweighttp n 1000000 c 1000 t 4 http127.0.0.18080codep  pFor two running instances the results is 44000 RPS, for one running instance  near 51000 RPS. I am very surprised with 7000 RPS differece. p  pAfter this test I add codeforkcode before codelistencode and run one instance of server, so now it has the same logic that previous implementation  two process with epoll loop listening socket, but codesocketgtbindcode called only once, before codeforkcode, and second process receive it FD copy for codelistencode call.p  pI run tests again and it shows 50000 RPSp  pSo, my question is very simple what magic do codeforkcode in this case and why it works faster than two independent process with it own codesocketcode Kernel do the same job for scheduling, I dont see any important difference.p

Negative 4584 pMyClass below represents a data structure that I need to be able to search very fast in two ways. So say I store the MyClass in and stdvector so that similar names in it can be quickly deleted and inserted continuously. But, I also need to be able to sort the contents of MyClass based on anInt. That is where an intrusive container or Multimap would sort the contents of a [very likely] unsorted stdvector.  Two containers performing two very different duties on the same underlying items.

Negative 4584 pIn my iOS 8 app using size classes, to get the iPad to have a different layout in portrait and landscape I have an codeIBOutletCollectioncode for each orientation that I activate and deactivate.  This has worked great up until the introduction of a Container View.p  pIm adding a new VC that is a separate tab item in the iPhone version, but I embed it into the iPad layout using a Container View.  Ill focus on just one size class, RegularRegular.  The container view has 4 constraints Trailing, Leading, Top, and Bottom.  When I run the app, it looks fine in that single orientation.p  pNow, when I add these 4 constraints to my codeIBOutletCollectioncode, the codeactivateConstraintscode message fails with the following error messagep  p Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSGenericException, reason Unable to activate constraint with items  layer   contentOffset 0, 0 contentSize 460, 78 and  because they have no common ancestor.  Does the constraint reference items in different view hierarchies  Thats illegal.p  pThe constraints dont reference items in different view hierarchies.  Top, Bottom, and Leading are all in relation to another view that is also in the VCs view.  The Trailing is in relation to a stepper that is also in the VCs view.  So theyre all at the same hierarchal level to my knowledge.  p  pWhen in debug, I can see that the constraint starts off with its codeactivecode property as codenilcode.  This appears to be normal the noncontainer constraints started off the same prior to them being set to codeYEScode.  I checked this with a for loop setting the codeactivecode property.p  pIs there something Im doing wrong with the constraints on the Container View  Are constraints on a Container View somehow special because they are on a Container View  Ive tried finding the answer myself, but I cant seem to find anything in regard to this issue Im having.  p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pem410 Edit to provide pictures amp code.  Note at this time Ive broken out the container constraints into a separate array so I can deal with them on their own.em  p  pIn the image below, the containers Leading, Top, and Bottom constraints are in relation to the view to the right of the container.  The Trailing constraint is in relation to the stepper above it. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5xqts.png altVC Layoutp  pRelated codep  precodeproperty strong, nonatomic IBOutletCollectionNSLayoutConstraint NSArray regularAnyConstraints property strong, nonatomic IBOutletCollectionNSLayoutConstraint NSArray regularAnyContainerConstraints  property strong, nonatomic IBOutletCollectionNSLayoutConstraint NSArray anyRegularConstraints property strong, nonatomic IBOutletCollectionNSLayoutConstraint NSArray anyRegularContainerConstraints codepre  pThese are the constraints in the codeanyRegularContainerConstraintscode array img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOc9uy.png altanyRegularContainerConstraintsp  precode[NSLayoutConstraint deactivateConstraintsregularAnyConstraints] [NSLayoutConstraint activateConstraintsanyRegularConstraints]  [NSLayoutConstraint deactivateConstraintsanyRegularContainerConstraints] [NSLayoutConstraint activateConstraintsanyRegularContainerConstraints] codepre

Negative 4584 pIm having a hard time understanding what a pointer is in a Btree. Are they the same as an internal node of a Binary tree  p  pstrongIf yesstrong, why the different name  br strongIf notstrong, how are they different p  pMy confusion comes after reading this Taken from wiki for B treep  blockquote   pThe primary value of a B tree is in storing data for efficient retrieval in a blockoriented storage context  in particular, filesystems. This is primarily because unlike binary search trees, B trees have very high fanout number of pointers to child nodes in a node,a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1201447427150831a typically on the order of 100 or more, which reduces the number of IO operations required to find an element in the tree.p blockquote  pI have read in other SO posts that a B tree is a B tree where the pointers dont hold data, only keys. So, whats this pointer  And if someone could explain how there are such a high number of pointers to a leaf node, that would be awesome p  pstrongEDIT strongp  pAfter the discussion in the comments section, things are starting to get clearer. However, in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma120144742715083 highly upvoted answer a to the difference between B trees and B Trees, the poster has put up an image, in which pink arrows are going out from the internal nodes. It says pointers to data records .. but arent the data located in the leaves, so why pointers here p

Negative 4584 pI am trying to write an extension method for the MVC controller class, since I see such code repeatedly in my programp  precodeif viewModel  null      return HttpNotFound  return ViewviewModel codepre  pThe idea is that I want an extension method called codeViewModelResultcode to take care of this, so that it will return either an codeActionResultcode or codeHttpNotFoundcode result depending on whether the view model is available. This way, I dont have to write these 34 lines of code every time. p  pHowever, it seems that the protection level of the methods codeViewcode and codeHttpNotFoundcode in the MVC controller is causing some serious trouble.

This confuses me, I thought in extension methods all private and protected methods of the very object labeled by codethiscode keyword are accessible, just like when you write a method in this class. But Ive been proved wrong, those nonpublic methods are inaccessible in extension methods. p  pNow the question is, how can I get by this issue I am kinda clueless, dont know what I can do about this. The MVC controller class comes within the .NET framework, and I cannot modify the source code. It is not recommended to change internal implementation of .NET framework anyway. Can anyone help What do you recommend me to do in this case p

Negative 4584 pIn my project I generate custom wrappers for youtube video embeds on the client side. I used to get video titles by parsing xml responses from codehttpgdata.youtube.comfeedsapivideosVIDEOIDcode. Recently Youtube changed the title field for every video with codehttpsyoutube.comdevicesupportcode indicating deprecation of Data API v.2. I went to v.3 documentation and got confused. It was talking about authorization credentials, registering a project in the developers console, etc. Is it really necessary to just get a videos titlep

Negative 4584 pI have this somewhat convoluted situation. Im given an object codeocode, a string codencode and array of objects codeargscode. I am to call the method codencode on the object codeocode with the given arguments.p  pThe problem is that this input always comes to the same thread, and the objects provided are sometimes controls created on different threads. So when I try to invoke certain methods on them I get the crossthread invocation exception.p  pIt wouldnt be a problem if I could just check if the object is a control and then call its codeInvokecode method and do my stuff inside of that call. Unfortunately, I cant do that because I could for example be passed a codeControlCollectioncode object that belongs to some control. If I call its codeAddcode method, I get the exception, but the codeControlCollectioncode has no codeInvokecode method.p  pWhat can I do about this Performance isnt something Im worried about yet so any solution is a good one. Maybe if I could catch the exception and get the thread it wants me to call from, then repeat the invocation Or maybe theres some way to get the thread an object belongs top

Negative 4584 pI have deployed a Java web application in Heroku. p  pNow, I want to change the backend so that it can notify connected users regarding specific events.

Negative 4584 pI am moving .NET Remoting solution to WCF. There are windows form client and WCF application server in session mode running as windows service and a layer of interaction application server and WCF core singleton server running as windows service too.  The structure of data consist of about 20 middle weight classes for core and application server with mostly composition relationship and with corresponding interfaces.  An interaction of a client and application server in .NET Remoting is provided by references to interfaces proxies on client to objects in server. That is working very well using full features of OOP. For example a Remoting requestp  precodeIDTGroupUser aDTGroupUser  addGroupUser group, user, requestor codepre  pServer sidep  precodepublic IDTGroupUser addGroupUserIDTGroup group, IDTUser user,   IDTGroupUser Requestor              if Requestor.User.IsSuperUser  Requestor.Group.IsAdmin                      DTGroupUser gu  new DTGroupUsergroup, user, Requestor             ISingletonSpace.groupUsers.Addgu             return gu                  else return null      codepre  pNow in WCF there is no object oriented approach.  So far I am trying to use server objects ID on client side to link to server objects. If client need something from server then p  pclient sending with each request one additional parameter  ID and on the server side first is searched by ID that object and then p  pperformed needed operation.  But this looks like a big bottleneck. WCF requestp  precodeint aDTGroupUser addGroupUser gID, uID, requestorID codepre  pServer side where IDTUser, IDTGroup, IDTGroupUser and ISingletonSpace are endpointsp  precodepublic int addGroupUser uint gID, uint uID, uint requestorID      if IDTUser.UserIsSuperUseruID  IDTGroup.GroupIsAdmingID       2 searching              uint guID  IDTGroupUser.createGroupUsergID, uID, requestorID  3 searching         ISingletonSpace.groupUsersAddguID                              1 searching         return guID          else return 1  codepre  pHow to organize interaction between client and application server without searching the objects Is there a way to make a datamember of datacontract as reference to object in serverp

Negative 4584 pWe know from QThread a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5qobject.htmlthreadaffinity relnofollowdocumentationa p  blockquote   pA QObject instance is said to have a thread affinity, or that it lives   in a certain thread. When a QObject receives a queued signal or a   posted event, the slot or event handler will run in the thread that   the object lives in.p blockquote  pDoes the thread affinity has any impact on the class instance data Does the class data becomes a thread datap  pApart from the above, the reason I am asking is because I want to pass a pointerreference of another class in its constructor. If I am being object oriented, I shall not access its data directly but if I call the other class member function of that class, will it also be called in this class thread as wellp

Negative 4584 pI have a table displayed using PHP. There are only two rows, the first row contains the headers, second row contains text box inside the td. What I am trying to do in this part of my script is for the user to enter some values, then I would like to grab the values according to the header names so that I can use them for a query.p  pI have created the table headers and text boxes according to how many headers there are as you can see in the codes below. This is inside one function, other parts are just the codes for the table and queries.p  pNow my main problem is that I want to get the values of each text box according to the headers. An example would be if the header is called codeConfigurationcode and the value in the text box under that header is the user has typed in code1,5,8code. After a button click, a new PHP function would be executed. This function is the one Im working on to get the text box values. Ive tried iterating through the table cells in Javascript but Im stuck at getting the text box values.p  pIf possible, I would like to know how all the headers can be stored in an array in Javascript, the text box values to be stored accordingly as well. If it were in PHP itd be something like codeuserinput[header][textval]code. Or just separate arrays would be fine as well as long as I am able to get the values that correspond to the headers so that I can use it in my query.p  pNote I am using ajaxs post to pass back values to my PHP file. The table is created with dynamic values so itll be getting the values in the same PHP file and passing it back to there as well called database.php.

Around ListBox I want to add GridLines on X and Y axis I hope thats the right word  data info on X axis and data info on Y axis  a hrefhttpi50.tinypic.com5fiyxh.jpg relnofollowexamplea  hour times every half hour or so on X and 0100 on Y axis.p  pSo on X axis I like to have hour from 000 to 2400 and on Y axis  from 0  100. I can use normal label or textblock and write number in is the simplest idea. But because grid of listbox will change depending on the data, I like to have manageable scaling. Start is always eg. 0 and end is also always eg. 100. I like to scale infos that show infos every 20 units 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 or every 25 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 or so.p  pI think do it with a Borders for little marking line and in next row with TextBlock define value. All this wrap in DataTemplate.p  pIf something unclear or have any questions please ask.p
Negative 4584 pA friend of mine and I are in our senior year and will be starting a senior project soon. We had the idea to do a data analysis and data visualization project for it. Our project involves reading a CSV file that is updated every 2 minutes, parsing that data, then storing it in a database. Once that data is stored we want to run some analysis on it and provide an API through which we could access that data to visualize in some way. Our end goal would be to build an Android app that displays some of the raw data from the CSV and the analysis in a user friendly format. I talked to another CS Major and he explained that I would need a few different servers to accomplish this One for the storage, another for analysis, and another for some type of queue that would make sure things dont get screwy while we are doing scraping and analysis. The problem is, I dont really know where to start with this. Ive done some work with a SQL database before and a PHP front end, but nothing with multiple servers. Ive heard of tools to use with big data projects like Hadoop but im not exactly sure where it fits in. If someone could point me to a resource of some kind to explain, or explain themselves, how I would start to structure this kind of project, that would be awesomep
