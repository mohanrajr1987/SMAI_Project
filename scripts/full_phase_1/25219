Positive 25219 pI have two codeUIPickerviewcode, codepickerView1code and codepickerView2code in my view controller. p  pWhat I want to achieve here is when I select a string from my codepickerView1code, it automatically changes the strings for the codepickerView2code.p  pI created a section 3 because there was a lot of strings, ideally I want this all in section 1, as I currently have my code set to 3 picker views but I only want two picker views.p  pHere is an example.p  pPickerview1 contains a,b,c,d.p  pIf a is selected, the codepickerView2code would show specific strings for that to choose from, if I choose b then the strings for a would not show but the strings for b would show separately. p  pIn section 2 I want each of those fields to correspond with the sub strings that are defined in section 1 and section 3, this then populates the second UIpickerview, so every time i select a string in the first picker view the second uipickerview generates the specific strings for that. p  pHere is my codep  precodePickerView Category IBOutlets      IBOutlet var pickerView1 UIPickerView  UIPickerView     IBOutlet var pickerView2 UIPickerView  UIPickerView     IBOutlet var pickerView3 UIPickerView  UIPickerView     IBOutlet var textField1 UITextField  UITextField     IBOutlet var textField2 UITextField  UITextField     IBOutlet var textField3 UITextField  UITextField      var SECTION2  [Select, Criminal Activity, Begging,Harassment, Criminal Damage, Disruption Of Service, Drunken Behaviour,Fare Evasion, Feet on Seats, Hate Crime, Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour, Litter, Missile Throwing, Noise,Rowdy Behaviour, Smoking Tobacco, Drugs, Threatsabuseintimidation towards Staff, Threatsabuseintimdation towards Passengers ]      var SECTION1  [Select, gtgtgtCriminal Activityltltlt, Assault, Arson, Trespass, Spitting, gtgtgtBeggingltltlt, On Board, Off Board, gtgtgtHarassmentltltlt, Stalking, On Board, At StopStation, Bullying, gtgtgtCriminal Damageltltlt, Damage to Exterior, Damage to Interior, Glass Breakage,Grafitti, Window Etching, gtgtgtDisruption Of Serviceltltlt, Interfering with the engine, Opening emergency exits, Pressing emergency stophandles, Throwing debris on to the linetrack, gtgtgtDrunken Behaviourltltlt, Drinking on the mode of transport, Drinking in the stationstop, Aggressive Drunks, gtgtgtFare Evasionltltlt, Fraudulent Pass, None payment of fare, gtgtgtFeet on Seatsltltlt, Purposeful Obstruction ]      var SECTION3  [Select, gtgtgtHate Crimeltltlt, Disability, Ethnicity, Gender, Race,Religion, Sexual Orientation, gtgtgtLitterltltlt, On Board, At stationstop, gtgtgtMissile Throwingltltlt, Stone Throwing, Throwing Objects, gtgtgtNoiseltltlt, Inappropriate Musical Content, Loud Music, gtgtgtRowdy Behaviourltltlt, School Children, ShoutingSwearing, Within Shelter, Within StationStop, GroupsGangs, gtgtgtSmoking Tobaccoltltlt, On Board, At stationstop, gtgtgtDrugsltltlt, Smoking Drugs, Drug Paraphernalia, Drug Taking, Drug Dealing, gtgtgtThreatsabuseintimidation towards Staffltltlt, On Board, At stationstop, gtgtgtThreatsabuseintimidation towards Passengersltltlt, On Board, At stationstop ]      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad          var Viewcontroller           pickerView1  UIPickerView         pickerView2  UIPickerView         pickerView3  UIPickerView         pickerView1.delegate  self         pickerView2.delegate  self         pickerView3.delegate  self          self.textField1.inputView  self.pickerView1         self.textField2.inputView  self.pickerView2         self.textField3.inputView  self.pickerView3          pickerView1.tag  0         pickerView2.tag  1         pickerView3.tag  2          textField1.inputView  pickerView1         textField2.inputView  pickerView2         textField3.inputView  pickerView3           func numberOfComponentsInPickerViewpickerView UIPickerView gt Int           return 1           func pickerViewpickerView UIPickerView, numberOfRowsInComponent component Int gt Int           if pickerView.tag  0              return SECTION1.count          else if pickerView.tag  1              return SECTION2.count          else if pickerView.tag  2              return SECTION3.count                  return 1           func pickerViewpickerView UIPickerView, titleForRow row Int, forComponent component Int gt String           if pickerView.tag  0              return SECTION1[row]          else if pickerView.tag  1              return SECTION2[row]          else if pickerView.tag  2              return SECTION3[row]                  return            func pickerViewpickerView UIPickerView, didSelectRow row Int, inComponent component Int            if pickerView.tag  0              textField1.text  SECTION1[row]          else if pickerView.tag  1              textField2.text  SECTION2[row]          else if pickerView.tag  2              textField3.text  SECTION3[row]                 codepre

Positive 25219 pI am facing an issue with keyboard in iOS 9. I have a UItextfield in a strongtable view cellstrong which was working fine on iOS 8.x.x, once I updated to iOS 9 it is displaying a keyboard which is nonresponsive. The keyboard is greyed out and tapping on the textfield for the second time opens a responsive keyboard. I am not sure why this is happening..  All other textfields in the application are working as expected...p
Positive 25219 pI have a form with textfield on my viewcontroller. When the user touches the textfield for adding their state I display a UIPicker for them to select one. Problem is if the keyboard is displayed from a previous textfield I cant get it to dismiss. Here is my codep  precode void textFieldDidBeginEditingUITextField textField       if self.currentTextField          self.currentTextField  nil         self.currentTextField  KIPTextFieldtextField      else          self.currentTextField  KIPTextFieldtextField            if self.currentTextField.tag  0  self.currentTextField.tag  self.arrSearchFields.count1           kill the editing         [self.view endEditingYES]         [self.currentTextField resignFirstResponder]          set the picker type         if self.currentTextField.tag  0              self.currentPickerType  SUPPLIERPICKER          else if self.currentTextField.tag  self.arrSearchFields.count1              self.currentPickerType  STATEPICKER                   if self.hasPicker              [self addPicker]          else              [self closePickerYES]                else          [self closePickerNO]        codepre  pFor those who responded with resignFirstResponder I have that and it works, but I need the keyboard to be dismissed when I am displaying the picker. So there are 3 textfields, TF1, TF2, TF3, for TF1 and 2, touching them launches a picker, when the user selects a picker row, the textfield is populated with that value and the picker is dismissed. However, if you go to TF2 first, the keyboard is displayed, you can dismiss it by either the return key or texfieldDidEndEditing will dismiss it. But say you dont enter any text but touch TF1 or 3, the picker is now displayed but the keyboard is still on the screen. I cant get it to dismiss, even with self.view endEditingp

Negative 25219 pIn my day job I, and others on my team write a lot of hardware models in VerilogAMS, a language supported primarily by commercial vendors and a few opensource simulator projects.  One thing that would make supporting each others code more helpful would be a LINTER that would check our code for common problems and assist with enforcing a shared code formatting style.  I of course want to be able to add my own rules and, after I prove their utility to myself, promote them to the rest of the team..  I dont mind doing the work that has to be done, but of course also want to leverage the work of other existing projects. p  pDoes having the allowed language syntax in a yacc or bison format give me a leg up  or should I just suck each language statement into a perl string, and use pattern matching to find the things I dont like p  pmost syntax and compilation errors are easily caught by the commercial tools.. but we have some of our own extentions. p

Negative 25219 pIm refactoring the way the client code for a bottomup web service is built.  The existing build creates the Java client code by using a deployment of the web service on JBoss 4.2 and executing the Axis 2 AntCodegenTask against a hrefhttpdevserver.urlwsdl relnofollowhttpdevserver.urlwsdla.  This method fails if the development server is down or has outdated wsdl.  Crusie Control fails whenever the wsdl changes.p  pI need to build the client code against the web service class itself instead of having to point to a deployment of the web service.  I use java2wsdl to generate wsdl from the web service class and then use the same AntCodegenTask to generate the client classes.p  pThe problem is that wsdl created by java2wsdl is different than what JBoss displays in a hrefhttpdevserver.urlwsdl relnofollowhttpdevserver.urlwsdla.  Among other things, some of the namespaces are different and the AntCodegenTask step doesnt convert these namespaces into the correct package structure.p  pIve got to get the final package structure to be what the client code expects.  The existing AntCodegenTask uses namespacetopackages... to accomplish that, but when I execute the same AntCodegenTask to the wsdl generated by java2wsdl it doesnt convert the namespaces to the package name.p  pWhy would Axis show different wsdl when the web service is deployed in JBoss than it generates from java2wsdlp  pIs there a way to use Axis to create the client code from the web service class without generating the intermediate wsdlp  pThe documentation for the java2wsdl and wsdl2java Ant tasks is a little bit spotty.  Axis 2 v 1.4.1 gives Ant tasks for AntCodegenTask and 2 Java2WSDLTasks in different packages.  The Axis 2 installation includes binaries for wsdl2java and java2wsdl, but no codegen binary.  Maybe AntCodegenTask is the same as wsdl2java.p  pHas anyone got something like this to work with Axis 2p

Theses represent a proxy object for example a MyServiceSoapClient and a number of autogenerated domain objects say, for example a CustomerInfo.p  pSo, if I do something along the lines of the followingp  precodeMyServiceSoapClient client  new MyServiceSoapClient CustomerInfo cust  client.GetCustomerJohn Smith codepre  pI will get back a CustomerInfo object with various properties etc, all nicely deserialized from whatever XML the server returned.p  pstrongThe Problem Is...strongbr  Lets say I change the value of the Name Property in the cust object to Bob Dylan.br  Ideally, Id like to have a base class called ServiceEntity that will track if changes have been made by trapping the continentlyprovided INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged event in the base class, to provide a Dirty property indicating that the object has changed since it was fetched from the service.p  pstrongThe Solutionstrongbr  Although the below answer is a good one, we took a slightly different approach...br  As the sync status only needs to be recorded in a few situations, it made more sense to add sync tracking through a Generic class, so we can use it as and when needed.br  Heres an example generic class and interfacep  pInterface  p  precodepublic interface ISyncEntity       ltsummarygt      Gets or Sets the Entity Sync State      ltsummarygt     [XmlIgnore]     [SoapIgnore]     EntitySyncState SyncState  get set        ltsummarygt      Flag for deletion      ltsummarygt     void DeleteOnSync       ltsummarygt      Flag for Creation      ltsummarygt     void CreateOnSync  codepre  pClass  p  precodepublic class SyncEntityltTEntitygt  ISyncEntity       ltsummarygt      Backing Field for Entity Property      ltsummarygt     private TEntity entity       ltsummarygt      Gets or Sets the Entity in question      ltsummarygt     public TEntity Entity              get  return entity          set  OnEntityChangevalue             ltsummarygt      Invoked when a Property on the Entity is changing      ltsummarygt      ltparam nameentitygtltparamgt     protected void OnEntityChangeTEntity entity               Detach the property change event handler from the previous entity         if entity is INotifyPropertyChanged             entity as INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged  OnPropertyChange           Set backing field         entity  entity           Implements INotifyPropertyChanged         if entity is INotifyPropertyChanged             entity as INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged  OnPropertyChange           Set the Sync State         SyncState  EntitySyncState.Unchanged              ltsummarygt      Fired when a property in the entity changes      ltsummarygt      ltparam namesendergtltparamgt      ltparam nameegtltparamgt     protected void OnPropertyChangeobject sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e               If a delete or create is already pending, dont worry about the update         if SyncState  EntitySyncState.Unchanged             SyncState  EntitySyncState.UpdatePending           region Sync Framework Members      [XmlIgnore]     [SoapIgnore]     public EntitySyncState SyncState              get         set           public void DeleteOnSync              SyncState  EntitySyncState.DeletePending           public void CreateOnSync              SyncState  EntitySyncState.CreatePending           endregion  codepre  pExtension Method  p  precodepublic static SyncEntityltTEntitygt ToSyncEntityltTEntitygtthis TEntity source      if source  null         throw new ArgumentExceptionSource cannot be null      return new SyncEntityltTEntitygt              Entity  source       codepre

Negative 25219 pIm writing a small software application that needs to serve as a simple planning tool for a local school. The problem it needs to solve is fairly basic. Namely, the teachers need to talk with the parents of all children. However, some children have, of course, brothers and sisters in different groups, so these talks need to be scheduled next to eachother, to avoid the situations were parents have a talk at 6 pm and another one at 10 pm. Thus in short, given a collection of emnem children, where some children have 1 or more brothers or sisters, generate a schedule where all the talks of these children are planned next to each other.p  pNow, maybe the problem can be solved extremely easy, but on the other I have a feeling this can be a pretty complicated problem, that needs and can be solved with some sort of algorithm. Elegantly. But am I right Is there Ive looked at the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHungarian5Falgorithm relnofollowHungariana alorithm but it doesnt quite apply to this particular problem.p  pEdit I forgot to mention, that all talks take the same amount of time.p  pThanksp
Negative 25219 pI have what seams simple, but I just cannot get it to work. I have a variable coming into a ViewControllerpresented by a modal view and in the viewController I access the appDelelgate to get at a variable in the passed NSArray. I can verify that the variable is availible with my NSLog just before I make a mess of assigning it, so I know it is there. in the .h file is the followingp  precodeclass ViolinMakerAppDelegate   interface DetailsViewController  UIViewController       ViolinMakerAppDelegate dappDelegate  DetailsViewController detailsView    IBOutlet UIViewController modalViewController   IBOutlet UITextView violinMakerDescription    property retain, nonatomic ViolinMakerAppDelegate dappDelegate  property nonatomic, retain DetailsViewController detailsView  propertynonatomic, assign UIViewController modalViewController  property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UITextView violinMakerDescription codepre  pIn the .m file is the following.p  precode    import DetailsViewController.h     import ViolinMakerAppDelegate.h      implementation DetailsViewController     synthesize detailsView, violinMakerDescription, dappDelegate          voidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated                     dappDelegate  ViolinMakerAppDelegate  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]          DetailsViewController detailsViewController  [[DetailsViewController alloc]initWithNibNameDetailsViewController bundlenil]          self.detailsView  detailsViewController      Tried below, but the variable is not getting to the IBOutlet..

I just keep getting nothing but the static text in the IB. I am sure I have the IB connected right, as I have it working similarly from a the RootViewController pushing another view, and all connections are the same and very simple. One IB outlet, one UITextView.p  pIt sounds crazy to me, but is there any reason that because this view is in a modal view, that it cannot load variables into text fields, only send variables back into the program from a modal controllerp  pAnyone out there like to help me get this through my dense skull what I am missing for this final code to assign it to the IBOutlet Thanks in Advance, Kirkp  pScott I have tried everything, and thought that was what was needed... not sure really.

Negative 25219 pAlthough I love the git history rewrite feature, how does one go about ensuring history isnt rewritten. p  pWe dont mind what a programmer does on their own machine, but we need to ensure that a version is not pushed to the server that changes history.p  pie We need to guarantee that a particular version from the past really was that version. So this would include preventing someone going through and permanently removes a file from the history, or permanently alters a file throughout all history. p

Negative 25219 pI have a webpage in ASP.NET 3.5 that will be creating WebControls dynamically. The WebControls that it will be creating will be known by their fully qualified path ie  System.Web.UI.WebControls.whatever.

Connected the client with dbgrid etc and that part works fine. p  pBut I want the client first to login and then be able to access data and I want the server to log each connection and also when the client logs off or is disconnected, so I am guessing I need the sessionID and a timeout.

Negative 25219 pAs I see it, the advantages of a list over an array are pretty obviousp  ul liGenerics provide more precise typing codeListltIntegergt, Listlt extends Numbergt, Listlt super Integergtcode.li liA List interface has a bunch useful methods codeaddAllcode, coderemovecode etc. While for arrays all standard operations except getset must be performed in a procedure manner by passing it to a static method.li liCollections offer different implementations like codeArrayListcode, codeLinkedListcode, unmodifieable and synchronized lists, which can be hidden under a common List interface.li liOOB length control.li ul  pAs disadvantages I can only mention the absence of syntactic sugar and a runtime type check. At the same time supporting of both structures requires frequent using of codeasListcode and codetoArraycode methods, which makes code less readable. So I am curious if there are any important benefits of using arrays that I miss.p

However, when my C code detects an event I would like it to call back into my C code. The C function pointer to call back into will be provided at runtime. Note that the C function pointer is to a function found in the exes execution environment. It may use static members from there.

Negative 25219 pI am wondering about the benefits of having the stringtype immutable from the programmers pointofview.p  pTechnical benefits on the compilerlanguage side can be summarized mostly that it is easier to do optimisations if the type is immutable. Read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2916358immutablestringsvsstdstringherea for a related question.p  pAlso, in a mutable string type, either you have threadsafety already builtin then again, optimisations are harder to do or you have to do it yourself. You will have in any case the choice to use a mutable string type with builtin thread safety, so that is not really an advantage of immutable stringtypes. Again, it will be easier to do the handling and optimisations to ensure threadsafety on the immutable type but that is not the point here.p  pBut what are the benefits of immutable stringtypes in the usage What is the point of having some types immutable and others not That seems very inconsistent to me.p  pIn C, if I want to have some string to be immutable, I am passing it as const reference to a function codeconst stdstringampcode. If I want to have a changeable copy of the original string, I am passing it as codestdstringcode. Only if I want to have it mutable, I am passing it as reference codestdstringampcode. So I just have the choice about what I want to do. I can just do this with every possible type.p  pIn Python or in Java, some types are immutable mostly all primitive types and strings, others are not.p  pIn pure functional languages like Haskell, everything is immutable.p  pIs there a good reason why it make sense to have this inconsistency Or is it just purely for technical lower level reasonsp

It has to be killed from the task manager. What I see from the dumps the application is stuck in an infinite loop.p  pThe loop is from walking a double linked list which has become cyclic. There are signs of memory corruption, in that many data members have strange values, like no matching enumerant, values under 0000FFFF or the linked list itself is reported as being 300 million in size which is not normal.p  pThe only other information I can get from the dumps is that a socket read operation failed with 0 data read.

Negative 25219 pHeres my problem I need to perform frequently readingwriting operations to one file via different threads, and I tend to use threading.RLock.acquire and threading.RLock.release to lock the resourcee.g., one txt file.

Negative 25219 pIt seems so obvious. How can I cast an object myObjet to the type of myObjet.getClass  I tried combinations of forName, cast and others ... none seem to work sp  pThe problem is that I have a list of Objects and I would like to get them back to their original type which is given by myObjet.getClass.getName.p  pRegards, Timp  hr  pYes this is Java and it is certainly not wrong. Let me explain the problem. Picture a program that deals with simple forms like Squares and Circles that are derived classes from Form, the main class.p  pSo there is a search function that returns a Form, but you have to provide the type and a reference of the form a number, for examplep  precodeForm myForm searchFormString formType, String formRef codepre  pI know what the Form it returns is going to be because I gave those arguments to the search function a square, for instance. The returned object will still be a Form, but I want it to be of the Square class, so I need to cast it. It is compatible since Square inherits from Form.p  pThe only problem is that formType is variable, it might indeed be Square, but it could also be Circle. That is why I need a generic cast for the return object.p  pIf I do a myForm.getClass.getName, I get Square. So I need to cast myForm to myForm.getClass. p  pDo you see the problem p

It looks like, in JSF 2, EL expressions in components that are not rendered are evaluated. This did not appear to be the case in JSF 1.2.

Negative 25219 pI have got a question regarding specific situation about using MySQL DB in a closedsource application. Tried to find some answers on this but none of them clearly regarded my specific conditions.p  pIm developing some application that uses MySQL DB to stores its data. The application will be sold for money and it has closed source. I wont be distributing MySQL DB with my application, I will tell my customers that they need to download MySQL separately and set it up on their server and then configure my app to use it. When connecting to the MySQL from my app I will be using some other .Net connector commercial license, not the one provided by MySQL on GPL.p  pHaving all these conditions above, do I or my customers need to purchase MySQL commercial license or would the GPL edition be okp  pThanks, Rafalp
Negative 25219 pIm writing a Rails application that serves files stored on a remote server to the end user.p  pIn my case the files are stored on S3 but the user requests the file via the Railsapplication hiding the actual URL. If the file was on my servers local filesystem, I could use the Apache header XSendfile to free up the Ruby process for other requests while Apache took over the task of sending the file to the client. But in my case  where the file is not on the local filesystem, but on S3  it seems that Im forced to download it temporarily inside Rails before sending it to the client.p  pIsnt there a way for Apache to serve a remote file to the client that is not actually on the server it self.

I have even thought about codemmapcodeing the file into memory which will not be a good solution if I use logs with more than 4GBs in size, and returning the mapped chunk back from the codeAllocatorcode that I will pass to the buffer.br This seems to be a bad approach since the circular buffer documentation says that codeAllocatorcode will be used for stronganystrong memory allocation and not just the buffer allocation.p  pIs there any other functionality for circular files, or some other way to do thisp  pEDIT Well, I actually meant logging in the sense of filesystem logs that is logging writes.

Negative 25219 pI have succesfully written some CUDA FFT code that does a 2D convolution of an image, as well as some other calculations. p  pHow do I go about figuring out what the largest FFTs I can run are It seems to be that a plan for a 2D R2C convolution takes 2x the image size, and another 2x the image size for the C2R.

Negative 25219 pI am still new to silverlight and would like to ask few questions that relate to performing common tasks in silverlight that you used to do in asp.net programming btw, I am using silverlight 4p  ol lipIn silverlight, how do you access a public property on a user control in a databinding expression without setting datacontext on the control itself For example, let us use a datagrid with ItemSource bound to some collection but you want to also databind to a value defined by a property your user control using the databinding expression, perhaps using Source property. In asp.net you could access any public propertymethod using lt expr .pli lipIn asp.net when a postback control was clicked and raised an event you were able to access the row in the event handler via event args and use FindControl to find any control in the row. Whats the equivalent process in silverlight I know how to do get the row using DataGridRow.GetRowContainingElement but then when I use row.FindName I cant find another control in the same row by its name, I get null back. I found postings to do something like grid.columns[colIndex] but thats error prone since you are using index to reference the column and then you have to get the cell content to access the control you after cell.GetCellContentrow. It is also not universal, the above illustrated how to do it in a datagrid.pli lipIn asp.net theres OnDataBind event you can handle on majority controls, is there something equivalent in silverlightpli ol

Negative 25219 pI have a shell script that calls a java jar file and runs an application.  Theres no way around this, so I have to work with what I have.p  pWhen you execute this shell script, it outputs the application status and just sits there pretty much a console so when something happens to the program it updates the screen. This is like with any normal non daemonizedbackgrounded process.  Only way to get out of it is ctrlc, which then ends the process altogether.  I do know that I could get around this by doing codepathtoshellscriptscript.sh ampcode, which would background it for my session I could use nohup if I wanted to logout.p  pMy issue is, I just dont know how to put this script into a init script.  I have most of the init script written, but when I try to daemonize it, it doesnt work.  Ive almost got it working, however, when i run the initscript, it actually spans the same console on the script, and just sits there until i hit ctrlc.  Heres the line in questionp  pcodedaemon basedirprog ampamp success  failurecodep  pThe problem is that I cant background just the codedaemon basedirprogcode part and I think thats where Im running into the issue.  Has anyone been successful at creating an init script FOR a shell script  Also this shell script is not daemonizable you can background it, but the underlying program does not support a daemonize option, or else I would have just let the application do all the work.p

So, I can use codeANY employees.age lt 18code  simple enough. But say I want to match any that have an employee under 18 who also has the last name Howser.

Negative 25219 pIm more of an HTMLCSS guy, and while I know a bit of basic Javascript, Im not sure how to code what Id like to see. Im trying to do this on a WordPress page.p  pThis is a page that shows upcoming events for a certain provinceregion of Canada, and has an interactive map at the top.p  pWhen a user clicks on a certain province on the map, it calls a function that loads a unique DIV and its content inside another container DIV to keep all content loading in the same spot. All the DIVs for each provinceregion are on the same page, as WordPress is installed in the root directory, and doesnt allow links to pages within the same domain other than the ones it creates.p  precode    ltdiv idmapgt     ltdivgt    ltdiv idscheduleBoxgt  content will be loaded here      ltdivgt  lt  DIV FOR BC EVENTS  gt     ltdiv idbcgt     ltdiv classscheduleheadergt     lth2gtUpcoming Events for British Columbialth2gt     ltdivgt     lttablegt     lttbodygt     lttrgtlt TABLE HEADERS gt     lttd classtableheadergtDatelttdgt     lttd classtableheadergtTimelttdgt     lttd classtableheadergtCitylttdgt     lttd classtableheadergtVenuelttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgtlt EVENT 1 gt     lttd classdategtAugust 01, 2011lttdgt     lttd classtimegt1200 AMlttdgt     lttd classcitygtKelowna, BClttdgt     lttd classvenuegtVenue Name Herelttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgtlt EVENT 2 gt     lttd classdategtAugust 01, 2011lttdgt     lttd classtimegt1200 AMlttdgt     lttd classcitygtKelowna, BClttdgt     lttd classvenuegtVenue Name Herelttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt     lttd classdategtAugust 01, 2011lttdgt     lttd classtimegt1200 AMlttdgt     lttd classcitygtKelowna, BClttdgt     lttd classvenuegtVenue Name Herelttdgt     lttrgt     lttbodygt     lttablegt     ltdivgt    Event listings for Alberta       ltdiv idabgt     ltdiv classscheduleheadergt     lth2gtUpcoming Events for Albertalth2gt     ....     ...     ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pBecause of WordPresss limitations, when the user clicks on another province, the previously displayed content is swapped with the new content without referencing a URL or HTML page.

Negative 25219 pI have a UIPageControl with lots of pages around 50 each of which represents a UITableView which has around 250 rows. I add the UITableView subview on the UIScrollView on demand as to keep the memory usage at low levels. However if you browse to all pages and scroll down through all the TableViews the memory usage shoots up making the application really slow. Please give me your insights on how to keep the memory usage as low as possible.

Negative 25219 pI am working on an asp.net MVC 3 project as a team member. This project has some folders like repositories, infrastructure, Datalayer, services, providers and ViewModels.

Negative 25219 pI adapted cyrilutil.el for having transliteration of the Mkhedruli script of Georgian language. A very quick and dirty hack, but it led me to trying to learn about displaytables.

I posted it here a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1253614 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com1253614ap  pIn addition to this, I alter the standarddisplaytable in .emacs to eliminate linewrapping eol char, and making split windows on tty use a nicer unicode character, like thisp  precodesetdisplaytableslot standarddisplaytable wrap   setdisplaytableslot standarddisplaytable verticalborder  codepre  pThe problem now is that, though transliteration works all right, I end up losing my standarddisplaytable adjustments.

Should I change ToBeProcessed to be an interface ItoBeProcessed that is used in the app and the plugin Then have a separate assembly that holds the base ToBeProcessed class which would not be referenced by the application at all just the by pluginp  pEDIT The problem was resolved by using an interface class. I still dont know what was going wrong but Kols answer showed that in theory this should have worked correctly the way it was.p

I just need ema path that includes exactly strong10strong nodesem. Butli liEach node has an attribute, lets say its color. Each node has one of strong20strong different possible colors.li liThe path Im trying to find is the shortest path with exactly strong10strong nodes, where each node is a different color. I dont want any of the nodes in my path to have the same color as any other node.li liItd be nice to be able to force my path to have one value for one of the attributes at least one node must be blue, for instance, but thats not really necessary.li ol  pThis is a simplified example. My full data set actually has three different attributes for each node that must all be unique, and I have 2k nodes each with an average of 35 outgoing edges. Since getting a perfect shortest path may be exponential or factorial time, an exhaustive search is really not an option.

Negative 25219 pBackground I need to create an NDIS filter intermediate driver. This driver will pass all traffic while collecting metadata primarily timing information. The driver will export this information to a user application by inserting its own packets containing the metadata and passing them up the stack. p  pMy question is regarding NDIS versions. Eventually, I will have to write a driver for both Windows XP and 7. However at the moment, I will only be implementing one of these as a proof of conceptprototype. I know that in NDIS 6 they split the filter functionality out from generic intermediate drivers into a separate driver type lightweight filter in order to simplify the creation of filter drivers. Microsoft provides examples of passthrough filter drivers in the DDK for both NDIS 5 and 6. Ive been looking at these examples and the NDIS 6 LWF only looks somewhat simpler although admittedly, Im still new to Windows driver development.p  pAll other things equal, it would be better to support Win XP first larger installed base, easier access to test machines, etc. However, if NDIS 6 lightweight filters would make for fastereasier development, I might be better off implementing the Win 7 driver first. p  pIn short In your experience has NDIS 6 noticeably simplified filter driver development compared to NDIS 5p  pThanks for any input.p

Negative 25219 pI have to render a complex table with variable number of columns. In this example number of columns depends of type of the subRow. For example, if the subRow is type 1, it has 3 actions, if the subRow type is 2, it has 4 actions. Together it is 7 actions, so my table has 7 columns  first two where i render subRow name and type descendant or children etc, but this is less important. these first two columns are always present, so 72  9 columns. Subrows are added from a tree not drawn on the example picture, beacuse its not relevant for this problem.p  pI made it work in internet explorer, beacuse im using font tag to hook on a knockout template to, but mozilla firefox and google chrome are not able to render this.p  pstrongMy question is  How to draw this in table, without of font tagstrongp  pI wouldnt have anything against some other tag, as long as firefox an IE can render it, but i tried most of them, and thy dont do the job.p  pEverything will be much more clear with pseudo code and picture p  pstrongHTML strong p  precodelttablegt lttheadgt     lttrgt         lt              So this is the table header.

Negative 25219 pWhen people select the light theme the keyboard changes to a light color. Unfortunately this doesnt contrast very well with the branding in the app Im making.

Negative 25219 pIm creating a json webservice C, WCF and I need to identify a user. There is no session management, therefore the user would need to send an identifying string for every command. The solution I came up with is to AES Encrypt the users credentials and the time when the string would expire currently 1000ms, then use Base64 to encode it HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode before sending via URL or otherwise.p  pMy problem is this The encoded string almost always looks the same, with very few changes I assume that would be the Minutes amp Seconds of the expiry, since the credentials date and hour very rarely changes. Although a string can only be used once the last received string is recorded, and the second to the last is likely to have expired, I still think it would be easy to just intercept and block the GET request, fudge a few things then resend it. And when the attack is automated, even the timeout probably wouldnt work.p  pSo. How can I introduce additional reversible entropy to an AES encoded Base64 stringp

Negative 25219 pi got a very specific question about server programming in UNIX Debian, kernel 2.6.32. My goal is to learn how to write a server which can handle a huge amount of clients. My target is more than 30 000 concurrent clients even when my college mentions that 500 000 are possible, which seems QUIIITEEE a huge amount , but i really dont know even whats possible and that is why I ask here. So my first question. How many simultaneous clients are possible Clients can connect whenever they want and get in contact with other clients and form a group 1 group contains a maximum of 12 clients. They can chat with each other, so the TCPIP package size varies depending on the message sent. Clients can also send mathematical formulas to the server. The server will solve them and broadcast the answer back to the group. This is a quite heavy operation.p  pMy current approach is to start up the server. Than using fork to create a daemon process. The daemon process binds the socket fdlisten and starts listening. It is a while 1 loop.  I use accept to get incoming calls.p  pOnce a client connects I create a pthread for that client which will run the communication. Clients get added to a group and share some memory together needed to keep the group running but still every client is running on a different thread. Getting the access to the memory right was quite a hazzle but works fine now. p  pIn the beginning of the programm i read out the procsyskernelthreadsmax file and according to that i create my threads. The amount of possible threads according to that file is around 5000. Far away from the amount of clients i want to be able to serve.  Another approach i consider is to use select  and create sets. But the access time to find a socket within a set is ON. This can be quite long if i have more than a couple of thousands clients connected. Please correct me if i am wrong.p  pWell, i guess i need some ideas p  pGroetjes Markusp  pP.S. i tag it for C and C because it applies to both languages.p

Negative 25219 pSomething that seems to be absent from the otherwise great new features for Windows Azure announced on June 7th, is the ability to define distributed caches for the reserved instances of a Website Cluster in Reserved Instance Mode.p  pAs of now it seems to be only possible to create distributed caches for standalone webroles or worker roles. Does anyone know a workaround or know if this is something that is comingp  pThe reason why Im asking this is because it forces me to create a dedicated worker role for caching and since Im contrained by costs I cant afford another three instances just for caching. This leaves me with a caching service thats not fault tolerant when in reality my three Webroles hosting the Websites would be a fault tolerant and b could contribute enough memory to the distributed cache that Id gain a much larger cache without a single point of failure as with a single caching workerrole.p

The same for coderes.onclosecode, which I read about in another post.

I know the data that is returned by the get is valid, it just wont run synchronously.p  pAnyone have any ideasp

Negative 25219 pIm writing a program where I need to parse a JavaScript source file, extract some facts, and insertreplace portions of the code. A simplified description of the sorts of things Id need to do is, given this codep  precodefoo[a, b, c] codepre  pExtract codeacode, codebcode, and codeccode and rewrite the code asp  precodefoobar, [0, 1, 2] codepre  pI am using ANTLR for my parsing needs, producing C 3 code. Somebody else had already contributed a JavaScript grammar. The parsing of the source code is working.p  pThe problem Im encountering is figuring out how to actually properly analyze and modify the source file. Each approach that I try to take in actually solving the problem leads me to a dead end.  I cant help but think that Im not using the tool as its intended or am just too much of a novice when it comes to dealing with ASTs.p  pMy first approach was to parse using a codeTokenRewriteStreamcode and implement the codeEnterRulecode partial methods for the rules Im interested in. While this seems to make modifying the token stream pretty easy, there is not enough contextual information for my analysis.  It seems that all I have access to is a flat stream of tokens, which doesnt tell me enough about the entire structure of code. For example, to detect whether the codefoocode function is being called, simply looking at the first token wouldnt work because that would also falsely matchp  precodea.b.foo codepre  pTo allow me to do more sophisticated code analysis, my second approach was to modify the grammar with rewrite rules to produce more of a tree. Now, the first sample code block produces thisp  pre Program     CallExpression         Identifierfoo         ArgumentList             ArrayLiteral                 StringLiterala                 StringLiteralb                 StringLiteralc pre  pThis is working great for analyzing the code.  However, now I am unable to easily rewrite the code.  Sure, I could modify the tree structure to represent the code I want, but I cant use this to output source code. I had hoped that the token associated with each node would at least give me enough information to know where in the original text I would need to make the modifications, but all I get are token indexes or linecolumn numbers.  To use the line and column numbers, I would have to make an awkward second pass through the source code.p  pI suspect Im missing something in understanding how to properly use ANTLR to do what I need. Is there a more proper way for me to solve this problem p

Negative 25219 pIve looked at loads of different sliders and havent found anything that accomplishes what the designer would like. The image below should help explain. Note that there is space above and below the slider for headerfooter content.p  pA. Basically the idea is for the next image 2 to be partially visible on the right using a certain amount of screen space, say 10.p  pB. The current image 1 floats to the left and fills the height  it may be a wide or narrow image.p  pC. The amount of space shown in light gray will depend on the users available screen space. When the images reach full resolution, then the gap will expand as needed.p  pD. In reverse, as the available space shrinks the gap will shrink, and p  pE. After the gap has reached a minimum size, the slides shrink.p  pF. Then the current slide 1 will start to be clipped from the left amp right if needed wide images.p  pG. For the animation, the next slide 2, slides over to fill the gap and then bumps the current slide 1 out, leaving a gap before pulling the next image partially in.p  pIs there a slider that already does something similar, or do I need to modify an existing one If so, what would be a good starting point Ive tried ones like Flexslider, but the JS resizing interferes with getting two on the screen.p  pNo image posting privs yet, so here it is a hrefhttpimgur.comswYtr relnofollowhttpimgur.comswYtrap

Negative 25219 pI have developed a REST API using Play Framework 1.2.4, and I have a strong liking for the framework.

Negative 25219 pI recently upgraded to Emacs24, and a number of my custom keybindings broke as a result of it. p  pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeemacsNamedASCIIChars.htmlthe fine manual,a it is possible to make Emacs stop conflating function keys with their ASCII control codes eg, it is possible to have codeCmcode and codeRETcode bound to different things, or codeCicode and codeTABcode, and so on. This has always been a large pet peeve of mine with Emacs, that such valuable first level keyboard shortcuts are wasted on things for which I already have dedicated keys on my keyboard. I want to bind them to different things, in my case, to modernize the keybindings by mimicking gedit. In Emacs23, this was working beautifullyp  precodeglobalsetkey kbd Ci gotoline globalsetkey kbd Cm commentoruncommentregion globalsetkey kbd Cd killwholeline   Fix some stuff broken by the above globalsetkey [delete] deletechar globalsetkey kbd TAB indentfortabcommand globalsetkey kbd RET newline codepre  pThen, I upgraded to Emacs24 and it broke, kinda. It still works in the sense that codeCmcode certainly does one thing, and codeRETcode does another, but the problem is that the return key no longer behaves properly in terminal mode or in the minibuffer. Instead of activating the command Ive just typed, in both cases, the return key simply moves the cursor down to the next line and Im left with no way of activating the commands I type in to either the minibuffer or the terminal.p  pIronically, Emacs24 introduced a lot of changes to the behavior of deleting, and in the process they decoupled codeCdcode from codeDELcode so that its actually now safe to bind codeCdcode to something without needing to bind codeDELcode back to the expected behavior, so it would be great if I could achieve similar it just works behavior for my return key, while codeCmcode is bound to something else.p  pSo, I can envision two possible solutions to this problem. One might look like thisp  precodeglobalsetkey kbd Cm commentoruncommentregion globalsetkey kbd RET dowhatiexpectthereturnkeytodoinanymode codepre  pOR, something like this would be even nicerp  precodesetq decoupleasciicontrolcodesfromfunctionkeys t codepre  pBut Im not aware of any such variable or function that would help me out in this scenario.p  pIve made several unsuccessful attempts at using modehooks to restore the correct bindings in terminal and minibuffer modes, but I just cant seem to get anything to work. Helpp  pThanks.p

Negative 25219 pI have several plots on one figure.  One is a 3D plot, the rest are 2D.  When I select Zoom on the toolbar, left clicking on the mouse uses the codezoom.mcode functions, and in 3D, it looks like it uses codecamzoom.mcode.  However, when I right click to bring up the context menu, the Reset to Original View looks like it only works on the 2D plots.  For the 3D plot, selecting this either does nothing or it loses the xaxis limits, and therefore the plot shows no data points I cant get it to work consistently.p  pIm trying to come up with a workaround for this problem.p  pI would like to override the context menu for just the 3D plot with my own function that would redraw the plot, and leave the default context menu for the 2D plots.

Negative 25219 pGiven a sorted array, it is very easy to visualize a BST from it in a topdown manner. For example, if the array is code[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]code, we can see that the root will be the middle element, that is code4code. To its left there will be a subtree whose root is the middle of the array slice to the left of code4code, that is code2code. In the same way it will be similar in the right also.p  pHow can we do this visualization for the bottomup approach to constructing the BST Basically I am trying to understand the algorithm to construct a BST from a sorted linked list, which takes codeONcode in bottomup manner, and codeONlog Ncode in topdown manner.

Negative 25219 pI want to run tests with randomized inputs and need to generate sensible random numbers, that is, numbers that match good enough to pass the tested functions preconditions, but hopefully wreak havoc deeper inside its code.p  pcodemath.randomcode Im using Lua produces uniformly distributed random  numbers.  Scaling these up will give far more big numbers than small numbers,br and there will be very few integers.p  pI would like to skew the random numbers or generate new ones using the old function as a randomness source in a way that strongly favors simple numbers, but will still cover the whole range, I.e. extending up to positivenegative infinity or code1e309code for codedoublecode.  This meansp  ul linumbers up to, say, ten should be most common,li liintegers should be more common than fractions,  li linumbers ending in 0.5 should be the most common fractions,  li lifollowed by 0.25 and 0.75 then 0.125,li liand so on.li ul  pA different description Fix a base probability emxem such that probabilities will sum to one and define the probability of a number emnem as emxsupksupem where emkem is the generation in which emnem is constructed as a surreal numbersupstrong1strongsup.  That assigns emxem to 0, emxsup2supem to 1 and 1, emxsup3supem to 2, 12, 12 and 2, and so on. This gives a nice description of something close to what I want it skews a bit too much, but is nearunusable for computing random numbers.  The resulting distribution is nowhere continuous its fractal, Im not sure how to determine the base probability codexcode I think for infinite precision it would be zero, and computing numbers based on this by iteration is awfully slow spending nearinfinite time to construct large numbers.p  pDoes anyone know of a simple approximation that, given a uniformly distributed randomness source, produces random numbers very roughly distributed as described abovep  pI would like to run thousands of randomized tests, quantityspeed is more important than quality.  Still, better numbers mean less inputs get rejected.p  pLua has a JIT, so performance is usually not much of an issue.  However, jumps based on randomness will break every prediction, and many calls to codemath.randomcode will be slow, too.  This means a closed formula will be better than an iterative or recursive one.p  hr  psup1sup Wikipedia has an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSurrealnumber relnofollowarticle on surreal numbersa, with a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwindex.phptitleFile3aSurrealnumbertree.svg relnofollownice picturea.  A surreal number is a pair of two surreal numbers, i.e. codex  nmcode, and its value is the number in the middle of the pair, i.e. for finite numbers codenm  nm2code as rational.  If one side of the pair is empty, thats interpreted as increment or decrement, if right is empty by one.  If both sides are empty, thats zero.  Initially, there are no numbers, so the only number one can build is code0    code.  In generation two one can build numbers code0   1code and code 0  1code, in three we get code1   2code, code1  2code, code01  12code and code10  12code plus some more complex representations of known numbers, e.g. code11  0code.  Note that e.g. code13code is never generated by finite numbers because it is an infinite fraction  the same goes for floats, code13code is never represented exactly.p

This is so that I can present a proper error message to the user. The example above with the malformed sku is contrived and I have no desire to make my Magento app work with those erroneous skus.p  pstrongUPDATE CAUSE OF ERRORstrongp  pI traced the codeloadcode call  that is triggered by the codeforeachcode, and it boils down to a bug Zend  PHP.p  pI traced the call to wwwlibZendDbStatement.php codestripQuotedsqlcode, and the following statement codesql  pregreplaceqqe2[q]q, , sqlcode on line 204 in Magento 1.7.0.2.p  pWhen codepregreplacecode is run with the SQL generated by the codeloadcode statement, the program just terminates. There is no trace in either apaches or phps log. The log works, because they get filled with other stuff.p  pa hrefhttpframework.zend.comissuesbrowseZF5063 relnofollowI found this bug report on the issuea. There they indicate it is a segmentation fault. I guess there is  no way to recover from that .p  pSince the question was explicitly about how to catch the error condition and a lot of the advice here was more about sanitizing the data I dont feel there is a clear cut winner for the bounty. But Franklin P Strube at least hinted at doing check deeper down the stack, so he gets it. p  pThank you for all you help guys. If you have any advice on how to handle segfaults please do share .p

Negative 25219 pIm building a bunch of forms that have labels and corresponding fields input element or more complex elements. p  pLabels go on the left, fields go on the right. Labels in a given form should all be a specific width so that the fields all line up vertically.p  pThere are two ways maybe more of achieving thisp  ol lipemstrongRowsemstrong Float each label and each field left. Put each label and field in a fieldrow divcontainer. Set label width to some specific number. With this approach labels on different forms will have different widths, because theyll depend on the width of the text in the longest label.pli lipemstrongColumnsemstrong Put all labels in one divcontainer thats floated left, put all fields in another floated left container with paddingleft set. This way the labels and even the label container dont need to have their widths set, because the column layout and the paddingleft will uniformly take care of vertically lining up all the fields.pli ol  pSo approach 2 seems to be easier to implement because the widths dont need to be set all the time, but I think its also less object oriented, because a label and a field that goes with that label are not grouped together, as they are in approach 1. Also, if building forms dynamically, approach 2 doesnt work as well with functions like codeaddRowlabel, fieldcode, since it would have to know about the label and the field containers, instead of just creatingadding one fieldrow element.p  pWhich approach do you think is better Is there another, better approach than these twop

Negative 25219 pIm basically asking if we can fake some sort of multiple inheritance on attribute classes. I have some view models with a lot of properties that are all getting the same combinations of attributes for field length, formatting, some custom stuff, etc. There are probably on the order of 50 fields like this. Some of the attributes have constants in them.p  pThis seems really bad as code duplication. If I want to change the formatting or any of these constants a bit, I have to find and fix every field individually. Is it possible for me to create some single [MyCustomFieldType] attribute that simply behaves as all of those other attributes combined, so it stays DRYp  pedit What I mean about code duplication is that each property has emmultiple attributesem Im not referring to the fact that there are multiple properties. I understand that even if I had one attribute to place, I would have to place it many times. But then at least I have one place the attribute class to change things like format strings or other numeric constant parameters.p

Negative 25219 pI have a problem with preferences, some users tell me that screen start blinking and is not possible to stop it and need to reboot. I tryed to eliminate every kind of code in java source setOnClickListener, setOnChangeListener, I also added some code in onDestroy to avoid to use setOnChangeListener to check if a value is changed,

Negative 25219 pSo Ive been using Python 3.2, and OpenPyXLs iterable workbook a hrefhttpopenpyxl.readthedocs.orgenlatestoptimized.html relnofollowas demonstrated here in the Optimized Reader examplea.p  pstrongMy problemstrong arises when I try to use this strategy to read a file or files that Ive extracted from a simple .zip archive emboth manually and through the python zipfile packageem.  When I call code.gethighestcolumncode I get A and code.gethighestrowcode I get 1, and when asked to print each cells value as shown herep  precodewb  loadworkbookfilename  filename, useiterators  True ws  wb.worksheets[0]     Only need to read the first sheet, nothing fancy for row in ws.iterrows     for entry in row         printentry.internalvalue codepre  pIt prints the values in A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and A7, regardless of how large the file actually is. There isnt any reason for this in the file itself, and it will open in Excel perfectly fine. Im quite stumped as to why it does it like this, but I assume that the unzipped XLSX is formatted differently prior to being saved from within Excel, and OpenPyXL cannot interpret it correctly.  I even renamed the .xlsx to .zip so that I could explore the file and examine the differences, but couldnt tell much except that the one saved from Excel also has a subfolder called theme within the xl folder that the previous version does not, with font and formatting data.p  pIMPORTANT NOTE When I open it and resave it with the same filename from within Excel and emthenem run this bit of code, it works strongperfectlystrong  returns correct greatest row and column values, and correctly prints every cell value.  Ive tried instead saving the workbook through OpenPyXL immediately after opening it, but this yields the same erroneous results.p  pBasically, I need to discover a method to properly extract a strong.xlsxstrong file from a strong.zipstrong file so that it can be read with OpenPyXL.

I tried it once, but it seemed way more complicated than the editors I was already using, and I gave up on it. However, I am wondering if maybe I should give it another chance, but I want to know if you think it is worth me putting the time in to learn how to use it Are the benefits that great And will it still most be useful in maybe 4 or 5 years I read it has been around already for over 20 or so years. p  pAlso, I am not really skilled at all in unix or Linux or any of that.

Negative 25219 pCurrently I am working on an application in C which I want to be const correct.  Meaning using const on parameters wherever possible, and stuff like that.  However, this C application makes use of a C library which does not use const often.  The problem Im running into is when sending parameters to functions in the C library the parameters cannot be const so I am forced to do a cast.brbr    Using const cast kind of detracts from the whole const correctness I have been working towards. When working with C libraries that are not const correct, do you just go with the flow and also not use const correctness in order to use these libraries easily  Or is there a better way that I am not seeing  Note that this is a rather small program, so isolating the part that uses the library and making just that part not const correct is not really an option.p

Negative 25219 pIm attempting to use the strongftplibstrong library in Python to try and FTP some videos to my website. Ive got a script with the basics working, but theres a problem with it. When I try to play my video back using VLC player, it appears that its corrupt, as it only plays the first 15 seconds of video probably until some important keyframe in the video, but thats likely besides the point and then the audio only sometimes continues. p  pThe strange thing about it is that if I perform an codels lcode on both the local directory and the remote directory, the filesizes are the same even though the Mac locally calculates the filesize as 75.6 MB while the cPanel File Manager shows it as only 71.2 MB. To doublecheck, the MD5 checksums on both ends also came out to be the same. But clearly, the data isnt entirely right on the server side.

Negative 25219 pI have been meddling with an idea in C to create a piece of software for pseudopersonal usage but ran into implementation problems. Well... maybe they are strongdesignstrong problems I am unaware of, but I just simply cant figure out.p  h2The idea, expectation and general pseudo algorithmh2  pConsider we have the following databasep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeFoo  Bar  Foobar Baz  Qux  Bazqux Foobar  Bazqux  Foobarbazqux codepre  pThese are emrecipesem for creating the said emitemsem. Using one codeFoocode and one codeBarcode, we create a codeFoobarcode emresultem which can further be an emingredientem for another emrecipeem.p  pNow think that we need to figure out the full recipe for the item codeFoobarbazquxcode. For the human mind and intelligence, its relatively easyp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeWe need Foobarbazqux Foobarbazqux  Foobar  Bazqux     Foobar  Foo  Bar     Bazqux  Baz  Qux  Foobarbazqux  Foo  Bar  Baz  Qux codepre  pAnd of course, if and when we have all emingredientsem at our disposal, we can run the emrecipeem and create the items with executing each emrecipeem in the order a few paragraphs above. So like we first create codeFoobarcode, then codeBazquxcode, then combine the two to get the final result.p  pBut in real time, the database is a stronglotstrong bigger. Thats where, I suppose, computers should come in. With a working software, the machine could easily find all the ingredients and execution crafting steps and give it to the user, so we dont need to read through strongALLstrong the entries by hand.p  h2The implementation ... attempth2  pI have thought about using C for achieving this piece of software. Commandline project, nothing shiny or anything, just pure codestdiocode.p  pFirst, of course, I needed to define the emitemem. emNoteem Right now I think about using structs, but if needed, I can upgrade them to classes. The database is initialized from some sort of sequential text file which will be made later. The database is not altered or written in any manner during or after execution, once it is loaded, its readonly. And of course, I needed to define the emrecipeem.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodestruct Item      public string Name   struct Recipe      public Item Result     public Item[] Ingredients  codepre  pThese two structs are held in a generic, codestaticcode codeListltgtcode field of codeProgramcode the default class.p  pAt entry point, we define some items and some recipes for testingp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeitems.Addnew Item  Name  Foo  items.Addnew Item  Name  Bar  items.Addnew Item  Name  Baz  items.Addnew Item  Name  Qux  items.Addnew Item  Name  Foobar  items.Addnew Item  Name  Bazqux  items.Addnew Item  Name  Foobarbazqux   recipes.Addnew Recipe      Result  GetItemFoobar,     Ingredients  new Item[]  GetItemFoo, GetItemBar    recipes.Addnew Recipe      Result  GetItemBazqux,     Ingredients  new Item[]  GetItemBaz, GetItemQux    recipes.Addnew Recipe      Result  GetItemFoobarbazqux,     Ingredients  new Item[]  GetItemFoobar, GetItemBazqux   codepre  pBecause items are primary keyed by their codeNamecode field, codeGetItemcode is simply a codeList.Findltgtcode shortcutp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeprivate static Item GetItemstring name      return Program.Items.Findmatch gt match.Name  name  codepre  pSo right now, the database is set. I have realized that I need to make some sort of recursive method to fetch all the ingredients, but this is where I came to problem.p  pConsider the following, first attempt this is not recursive, only goes one level deepp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodestring search  Foobarbazqux SearchRecipesearch codepre  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeprivate static void SearchRecipestring search      ListltRecipegt itemrecipes  Program.Recipes.FindAllmatch gt match.result.Name  GetItemsearch.Name      foreach Recipe recp in itemrecipes              Console.WriteLine         Console.WriteLineIngredients           foreach Item ingredient in recp.Ingredients                      Console.WriteLineingredient.Name                codepre  pThis produces the following output, which is, without recursion, is pretty fine and expectedp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode Ingredients Foobar Bazqux codepre  pSo for the recursion, I modified the code like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode    foreach Item ingredient in recp.Ingredients           if recipes.FindAllmatch2 gt match2.Result.name  Ingredient.name.Count  0                SearchRecipeingredient.Name                Console.WriteLineingredient.Name      codepre  pNow the output is the followingp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode   Ingredients     Ingredients   Foo  Bar  Foobar    Ingredients  Baz  Qux  Bazqux codepre  pI see what happens as I understand my code right now. Lines marked with codecode are recursions for codeFoobarcode, codecode are recursions for codeBazquxcode and codecode are the output of the original method call. But this isnt... kinda the output I would want to implement, as it fails to be understood easily and... isnt generally right.p  h2The expected output and the questionh2  pThe output I visualized is something like the following of course the extra status lines are ignorablep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeSearching for Foobarbazqux 1 recipe found.  1 Foobarbazqux  1 Foobar  1 Bazqux 1 Foobar  1 Foo  1 Bar 1 Bazqux  1 Baz  1 Qux 1 Foobarbazqux  1 Foo  1 Bar  1 Baz  1 Qux  1 Foo  1 Bar gt 1 Foobar 1 Baz  1 Qux gt 1 Bazqux 1 Foobar  1 Bazqux gt 1 Foobarbazqux  Exit. codepre  pThis is what I call as embreaking downem the emchain of item creationem recipes... or... I dont strongcallstrong, but strongimaginestrong so, in reference to the questions title. So the program works asp  ol liUser enters the final emitemem they are searching for this is codeFoobarbazquxcode in our exampleli liThe program ravages the database enough times so first the emingredientsem of the searched emitemem are found, and then it recurses deeper until it finds only subatomic emingredientsem that cannot be crafted from others they are not a codeResultcode for any codeRecipecode.li liWhile working so output is shown.li ol  pemNoteem Fits the real scenario better, but makes an extra implementation gap Much of the items have more than one recipes from which they can be created.p  pWhat I would like to strongaskstrong for is advices and help. I am slowly wanting to convince myself that this program is strongunwritablestrong which is only some sort of desperate outcry and that my idea has emdesignem issues. But I still hope that, within boundaries, we dont need fancy, yettobecreated AI systems to solve this... kinda underestimatable problem.p  pThank you.p

Negative 25219 pI am using Blend 2012 to design an HTML5 Windows 8 metro app, but I am running into problems because Blend runs all JavaScript in the webpage in the background, live updating my app while it is running. This slows down blend horribly, as I am still prototyping and havent finished the functionality of the app yet, so it is doing a lot of debug printing, etc. p  pIs there a way to either disable JavaScript or simply pause execution so I can edit the HTML in Blend without it running my code I would prefer a solution that is toggled in Blend, rather than adding code in my project to disable functionality if it detects Blend as its host, however I will gladly accept that if it is the sanest method.p  pThank youp

Negative 25219 pWith functional reactive programming, is there a common technique for handling events in different streams that must be coordinatedp  pE.g. suppose you have streams A, B, C that are related like A  B, B  C, and A  C i.e. B depends on A, C depends on A and B. If A emits an event, for some period C is holding the latest A, but old B which is derived from the old A, which is an inconsistent state for stream C.p  pThere are various solutions that require deep knowledge of whole FRP stream graph, e.g. if C knows all the relationships between its dependencies, it will know B depends on A, and can wait for both A and B before emitting. This seems complex and expensive.p

The new version is responsive and therefore uses codetransformcode to go between slides, rather than the old way of using the codeleftcode property used in v3.x.p  pI have created a demo here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSXZjV relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netSXZjVap  pWhen viewed in Safari 5, the hover on the blocks dont do anything. However, when disabling codewebkittransform translate3d0px, 0px, 0pxcode via the inspector, the animations work fine.p  pstrongIs there a way to get the two transforms to work in harmonystrongp  pMany thanks.p  pP.s. I am yet to test this behaviour in Safari 6 as I am currently running Snow Leopard.p

Negative 25219 pI have several codeEmployeecode objects which are all codeSerializableAttributecodes. This is due to WCF, because these are objects passed between the client and the server. p  pI would now like to save and load several of these, either to a file or by using codeSystem.Propertiescode namespace. With the System properties, I could not find a way to save them because the types that are allowed are pretty limited int, string, float and some others. Theres nothing involving serializable, and the only collection available is a string collection.p  pWhat would be the best approach Im not sure what is the proper way to save a collection, like Listlt of SerializableAttributes to a file.  Otherwise, I can use System.properties and I could do it the hard way by converting the objects to strings and back, but this approach will be pretty ugly.p

You can think of the class this method lives in as a row iterator made up of individual column iterators, which are stored in codeviscode. Im not surprised that this method gets called a lot since its an iterator, but I emamem surprised that the program spends a lot of its time eminem this method. This method doesnt do too much, so why is it spending its time herep  pHere are the specific questions Im askingp  ol liIs there some gotcha of VisualVM Im hitting For example, could the JIT be confusing VisualVM in some way thats causing VisualVM to attribute time to the wrong methodli liWhy would the program be spending its time here The method just doesnt do too much.

Maybe is a problem on my PC, maybe a Sage problem or a Python bug I didnt try the same on Python.p  pUsing codexrangecode instead of coderangecode doesnt help either.

It was great. I started of with a little application which worked fine. After, I tried using my actual codeWPFcode application, but what seemed to happen was, after including all the codedllcodes, and after launching the .exe file, the application didnt run at all. I tried on other machines within the office, but the same problem occurred. The application just didnt execute.p  pI then tried a simple codeWIXcode installer without the dialogs. And I seemed to experience the same thing as the Advanced Installer did  It just didnt execute the code.execode file. p  pWhat I tried to test whether it was my application was that I copied all my codedllcodes from my debug folder of my actual application, and pasted them into the Program Files on my codeCdrivecode. And that seemed to work on other machines as well as my own  which got me even more confused I also made sure that the application build options were as followsp  precodeBuild Option Page   Copy to Output Directory Do not copy  Custom Tool MSBuild Compile  codepre  pTherefore, I am struggling to come to terms whether it is my application whether its the codedllcodes or something missing within the actual app strongORstrong whether I have been missing something within the actual installer using codeWIXcode.p  pAny help, expertise or guidance would be much appreciated to help me understand what I am doing wrong  Like I say, I am new to the whole packaging so it might be something really silly that I am missingp  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 25219 pI was wondering if anyone knows if ASP.NET charts plot points when you specify the value of 0, assuming that every other point is above the value of 0.  So lets say for example, we have values code0, 0, 0, 4234, 4342, 6354, 75656 0, 0, 0, 56342, 2243, 3432, 0, 0, 0code  Will asp.net plot any of the 0s or will it simply skip them and show the next dates because it will consider there was no data for those 0s.p  pFor sake of argument lets say we are using a column graph that plots number of eggs laid by all chickens in Canada for range of days.p  pSo will my graph show empty columns for the 0s or will it condense and show the next column with data instead.p

Negative 25219 pUnder the hood, a C method of a class is like a C function whose first parameter is an instance of the class  or struct.p  pFor examplep  precodevoid FooDo codepre  pwould be equivalent to this declaration in Cp  precodevoid DoFoo this codepre  pHence, using a member msomeMember from within a method is like using thismsomeMember from inside the C function.p  pAfter so many years of CC programming experience, I just recently asked myself iWhat if I call a method from an instance pointer that is NULLip  pMy guess was iIf the method refers to no member at all, when why would it craship  pSo I did a quick test on a Windows platform, with Visual C 2008p  precodeclass Foo  public     Foo      virtual Foo       void Do   void FooDo      cout ltlt Calling Do for  ltlt this ltlt endl    int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      Foo foo     foo.Do      Foo pNullFoo  0     pNullFoogtDo      return 0  codepre  pWhich gives an output likep  precodeCalling Do for 0038FE5C Calling Do for 00000000 codepre  pThis could be an hassle when doing postmortem debugging of a crash over an instance pointer that is null. You might think that this method cannot be called if this is invalid.p  pOn the other hand, if the method is declared virtualp  precodevirtual void FooDo  ...  codepre  pThen the linep  precodepNullFoogtDo codepre  pwill produce an page fault exception. Why Because instances of a class with virtual methods have a pointer to the vtable to the child class virtual methods they belong to. So the first thing the compiler would do is to make pNullFoo to access its vtable member, then bangp  pIn conclusion, this is better design to have non contextual functions like Do be implemented as procedural routines than methods, unless they are virtual.p

I think window.location.reload is not working, because when I just comment this line and try clicking the button and manually refresh the page it shows the changes Status.p  pCan you please suggest what should I use to make this work in Firefox and Chromep  pWhen I googled, I found somewhere it works in Firefox and Chrome if you give it in setTimeout. I tried it, but even then its not working for me.p  precodeltscriptgt      document.body.onclick, activate, function           var pkgVersion  this.attrdataversion         alertUrl.ActionSetActivePackage, Deployment,  version pkgVersion          .getUrl.ActionSetActivePackage, Deployment,  version pkgVersion .donefunction                      setTimeoutfunction   window.location.reloaddata , 0      ltscriptgt codepre  pPlease suggestp

Negative 25219 pnew iOS developer here. I have multiple views that require different images to be displayed in portrait and landscape. I currently have implemented that successfully and the portrait image loads fine, and, upon rotation, the landscape image also loads fine. However, if the device is in landscape orientation then switches to another view, it loads improperly  wrong size, resolution, alignments, etc. My code for dealing with orientation changes is belowp  precode voiddidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationfromInterfaceOrientation              ifself.interfaceOrientation  UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft  self.interfaceOrientation  UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeRight                      image1.image  [UIImage imageNamedLandscape.png]                  else ifself.interfaceOrientation  UIDeviceOrientationPortrait  self.interfaceOrientation  UIDeviceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown                      image1.image  [UIImage imageNamedPortrait.png]           codepre  pI believe it is because the method is only called upon rotation. If I rotate the improper, initial landscape view, for instance, it displays the correct images once again. Is there a way to get the method to run and load the proper landscape view when the initial orientation is in landscape Or a way to force the correct image to display Thanks much.p

Negative 25219 pI am doing a thermodynamic simulation on a double dimension array. The array is 1024x1024. The while loop iterates through a specified amount of times or until goodTempChange is false. goodTempChange is set true or false based on the change in temperature of a block being greater than a defined EPSILON value. If every block in the array is below that value, then the plate is in stasis. The program works, I have no problems with the code, my problem is that the serial code is absolutely blowing the openmp code out of the water. I dont know why. I have tried removing everything except the average calculation which is just the average of the 4 blocks up, down, left, right around your desired square and still it is getting destroyed by the serial code. Ive never done openmp before and I looked up some things online to do what I have. I have the variables within critical regions in the most efficient way I could see possible, I have no race conditions. I really dont see what is wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 25219 pI am using RCurl for the first time to enter data into a form on the website. I need to be able to select a particular option from a drop down list and submit the form. The tricky part is the website is directed from another page before that. To be more specific, below is the url of the page I am trying to post the form inp  pa hrefhttpenergyalmanac.ca.govpetroleumfuelswatchpage2.php relnofollowhttpenergyalmanac.ca.govpetroleumfuelswatchpage2.phpap  pAs you can see there are no options available in the drop down list as this page is directed from another page before this which populates the options. By manually inputting the data in the previous page and inspecting the values populated, I have figured out that the values in the drop down list increment by 1 every week. Currently, for example, that value is 1091. This value needs to be assigned to the input field PkID. However, despite looking at other StackOverflow questions and reading up on the postForm function, I am unable to populate the form and get to the next page. p  pMy question is am I missing something in my code that is not posting the value correctly Or is the code not working because entering that url, there are no available options in the drop down list. p  pBelow is the code that I have. I apologize if my explanation isnt clear.p  precodepostFormhttpenergyalmanac.ca.govpetroleumfuelswatchpage2.php,     PkID  1091, style  post codepre  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 25219 pIn playing around with brushes I was wondering if it is possible to create a GradientBrush that goes around the outside edges of a Windows Phone page. For instance, for each side, the part farthest from the center of the screen would be the devices accent color or a gradient of colors, while the inner part would be PhoneBackgroundBrush or transparent so a fading effect would be seen. I would only need the gradient to be a very small portion of the entire phone screen, and not stretch into the very center of the screen.

Negative 25219 pI was wondering is it possible to display random page each time I refresh my url addres. I have my local network. Inside, lets say I have address base.lan and few other pages like page1.lan, page2.lan, page3.lan So every time I enter or refresh base.lan page I would like to see one of that other pages. I also added js code which refresh page every few mins to auto change contentp  pFor the static page I could usep  precodeltiframe srcpage1.lanindex.htmlgtltiframegt  codepre  pbut I need to display that pages randomly page1, page2 or page3. And the page should looks natural. I also was thinking about reverse proxy but I dont know how to display random page and what happened when I reload that page even tho I have to add refresh script on each pagep

Negative 25219 pFirst of all I would like to thank anyone who replies to this, your help is greatly appreciated p  pI am trying to compute the standard deviation of a set of floating point numbers passed to my program as command line parameters. First I store each of the parameter strings in a codetempcode variable, then I parse them to floating point numbers using codesscanfcode. My first problem is that the first and when I say first, I am talking about the one after the name of my program...so actually the second command line parameter doesnt get parsed. In the loop that I use to compute the average of the numbers I try to print out each parameter right after I parse it to a floating point number. It always prints all of them except the first one. The first one always gets printed as codenancode. Also, the variable codestddevcode gets printed as codenancode as well, even though I never modify it. This puzzles me.

Negative 25219 pBasically, I want my app to behave like Photos.app does. When you zoom into an image, nothing special happens, it just makes that portion larger. However, if you then zoom out and the image has black letter boxing around it, it will center it properly so the black borders are balanced vertically and horizontally. So basically it will center it when needed, but leave it otherwise.p  pMany a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions638299uiscrollviewwithcentereduiimageviewlikephotosappquestions and their corresponding answersa try to address this, but they seem to all implement it emas the image is being zoomedem. I just want it to center the image properly post zoom if needed. Is there an accepted way to do thisp  pRight now I simply have it like thisp  precode voidscrollViewDidEndZoomingUIScrollView scrollView withViewUIView view atScaleCGFloatscale      [UIView animateWithDuration0.3 animations         [self centerViewInSuperviewself.imageBeingOverlayed]     ]  codepre  pBut it gets called when it doesnt need to be called or when a user is zooming in on something specifically so the image neednt be centered. Should I just adjust that method to somehow detect when theres black bars around it and it doesnt need to be centered Or is there a more widely accepted wayp

Negative 25219 pIve got a test case that accesses the browser and does some stuff with it. But I need to programmatically change what the inputs are for some of the text boxes. I have 8 strings and a boolean value that the test needs the run properly.  The problem is, is that you have to run the test case through ant and the build process before you can actually run it. Id love to be able to build this, put it on the device and then somehow pass the data to the device when I call it. But I dont know if that is possible.

Negative 25219 pIm working on an iPhone app that involves certain physics calculations that are done thousands of times per second.  I am working on optimizing the code to improve the framerate.  One of the pieces that I am looking at improving is the inverse square root.  Right now, I am using the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFastinversesquareroot relnofollowQuake 3 fast inverse square roota method.  After doing some research, however, I heard that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6666451fastinversesquarerootontheiphonethere is a faster way by using the NEONa instruction set.  I am unfamiliar with inline assembly and cannot figure out how to use NEON.  I tried implementing the a hrefhttpscode.google.compmathneon relnofollowmathneona library but I get compiler errors because most of the NEONbased functions lack codereturncode.p  pEDIT Ive suddenly been getting some unclear question close votes.  Although I think its quite clear and those who answered obviously understood, maybe some people need it stated explicitly emHow do you use Neon to perform faster calculations And is it really the fastest method for getting the inverse square root on the iPhoneemp  pEDIT I did some more formal testing on Neon VS Quake today, but If anything, Im even more uncertain about the outcome nowp  ul lipInApp Testing An app that is currently in the app store with its invsqrt method modifiedp  ol liQuake Method leading by a marginal increase in average FPS under stressful conditionsli liNeon It was a really close call but it seemed that Quake was slightly fasterli li1sqrtf a bit more noticeable difference, 13 FPS drop.li olli lipFormal Testing An app that devours my Phones CPU.  Times how long it takes each method to get through an array of 10000000 randomly generated floatsp  ol liNeon clearly the fastest, and double the speed if it is used to do two sqrts at once.li li1sqrtf Only marginally slower than Neon.  This surprising result leads me to deem this test inconclusive until I investigate furtherli liQuake This method, surprisingly, was a few orders of magnitude slower than the other two methods.  This is especially surprising given its performance in the other test.li olli ul  pWhile quake vs neon was too close to say anything for sure in the app performance test, the quake vs 1sqrtf was quite clearly cut out in the first test, and the second test was extremely consistent with the values it outputted.  What is important in the end, though, is app performance, so Im going to make my final decision based on that test.p

Negative 25219 pIm doing a graphics test using PyGame to simulate the Dragon Curve being unfolded. I already made one successful version that keeps track of all the points as they rotate around each other, but obviously, this begins to slow down pretty substantially after a few iterations. In order to speed this up, I want to simply store the drawn segments into an image variable, and continually save a segment of the screen to a variable and draw those moving rather than keeping track of a lot of points. How can I do either of the followingp  ul liDraw to an offscreen image variable that then gets drawn to the screen in the correct placeli liSave a section of the visible display into an image variableli ul  pI tried reading through some of the PyGame documentation, but I didnt have any success.p  pThanksp

Negative 25219 pFirst let me tell you Im new to the .NET world, but have been Software Emgineer for 16 years, so Im not new to coding. I ran across something that has me baffled, and maybe a more seasoned .NET developer might know what is causing a perfomance issue of my COM object. I have spent days browsing through forums with no luck, I decide to seek help by putting this post together.  I have developed my .NET code in VS 2010 using C.  I know, the IDE is little aged. The code is pretty simple. The main method takes the Certificates encoded string, converts it to a byte format, and passes that to the X509Certificate object. I then use the objects method to get the expiration date. I also added a memory cleanup class hoping it would solve my problem.

As you might have expected, it works fine, however this is where my problem occurs. When I first ran the code it flew, it took roughly 10 minutes to go through 4,000 records.  I had a few anomalies that I wanted to check, so I ran it a couple more times.  Each time it degraded, and enventually started crawling.  My first thought was it was a memory leak.  Since I was running it locally, I decided to turn off the power to the pc see if it cleared.  It did not.  I also installed it on my laptop to prove to myself it ran smotthly on its first run. Ran fine on the first one, then perfomance started degrading on consecutive runs.  Last day it was running so slow it was over 8 hours. This is local machine testing so there are is no servers to contend with network traffic. I am at a complete loss, can anyone tell me what is going on  CPU is at 20 when running, and Mem usage for notes2.exe growsa little each time.  It slows down when it enters p  pexpirationdateexpirationdateCOMObj.GetCertExpirationDaterawdatap  pThats the bottleneck. I am completely stuck, does anyone know what is going on p
Negative 25219 pLets assume we have the following scenario, 2 entities users, images.br Users can like images, and also follow each other. So we have 2 relational tables, userlikes and follow where who liked what, and who follows who are keptp  pSo, we are represented by a user and want to perform a search to fetch images that are liked by our friends and are named cat.jpg.p  pIn sql something like that would look likep  precodeSElECT DISTINCTimages.id  FROM images  JOIN likes ON likes.imageid  images.id  JOIN    SELECT follow.followingid     FROM follow     WHERE follow.followerid  MYID as following   ON following.followingid  likes.userid  WHERE images.name  cat.jpg ORDER BY images.date DESC LIMIT 0, 20 codepre  pThe above query will return the 20 most recent unique ids of the images the users we are following liked and that are the images named cat.jpg. p  pMy question is... How can this procedure be optimizedp  pThe first thought that comes to my mind is caching, but if another user searches for cat.jpg she will be served different results because she will follow a different set of users. Therefore caching in this specific scenario seems costly since there can be a huge amount of possible searchkeywords and a huge set of usersfollowingusers combinations. Is it a viable solution If that user never again searches for cat.jpg then caching the response would simply be a waste of memory.p  pGenerally I ve seen people suggesting using Redis or even Memcached for storing peruser lists of updates or social feed entries, but in a search scenario something like this seems to fall short. No p  pAny suggestions, tips, or links with resources discussing similar issues and approaches, are greatly appreciatedp

Negative 25219 pI have encountered a following problem when trying to optimize my application with CAmp the data transfers. For me, there is no problem with copying data from CPU to GPU as I can do it in the initial state of the application.

Negative 25219 pI have a script that uses ajax to send mail. I have tested it by checking the email that will receive the mail and true enough, the ajax request is successful. I also checked the console window of my Firefox browser and it also shows me a successful message. But my problem here is that instead of the codedonecode callback function, the codeerrorcode callback function is fired. You may all wonder why Im still using the codeerrorcode function instead of codefailcode. The reason for this is because when I tried using the codefailcode function, it doesnt trigger the alertbox that I have set inside it. So what I did is go back and use codeerrorcode function again since at least it triggers the alertbox I made.p  pHere is the scriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var submitButton  submit               Variable to cache button element     var alertBox1  .success                  Variable to cache meter element     var alertBox2  .alert     var closeButton1  .close1                   Variable to cache close button element     var closeButton2  .close2                   Variable to cache close button element       function          contactform .submit functione             e.preventDefault             console.log hello              var formData   this .serialize             console.log formData               .ajax                  type POST,                  url send.php,                  data formData,                  dataType json,                  done function                          submitButton.fadeOut500  Fades out submit button when its clicked                         setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                              alertBox1.fadeIn500  Fades in success alert                         , 500                  ,                  error function                     submitButton.fadeOut500  Fades out submit button when its clicked                         setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                              alertBox2.fadeIn500  Fades in fail alert                         , 500                                                  closeButton1.clickfunction   Initiates the reset function             alertBox1.fadeOut500  Fades out success message             setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                 input, textarea.notinput[typesubmit].val  Resets the input fields                 submitButton.fadeIn500  Fades back in the submit button             , 500                  return false  This stops the success alert from being removed as we just want to hide it                   closeButton2.clickfunction   Initiates the reset function             alertBox2.fadeOut500  Fades out success message             setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                 input, textarea.notinput[typesubmit].val  Resets the input fields                 submitButton.fadeIn500  Fades back in the submit button             , 500                  return false  This stops the fail alert from being removed as we just want to hide it               ltscriptgt codepre  pWhat seems to be the one causing this Just to reiterate, Ive tried using codefailcode instead of codeerrorcode callback function since that is one of the answers I found in the Internet and also because I know for a fact that the codeerrorcode function is already deprecated.

Negative 25219 pMy goal with this was to make it so that all codeLevel.WARNINGcode and higher codeLogRecordscode sent to codeBukkits Loggercode were sent to a log file that Ive specified, as well as the console as per usual. Ive seen a few web pages showing examples of having multiple handlers for a single Logger and couldnt see how my code differed. Ive been messing around with it for a while and cant seem to figure out what is causing the odd behaviour observed in both the console output and file output.p  pI cause a codeNullPointerExceptioncode in my codeItemFrameListenercode whenever a player right clicks an item frame and expect it to be logged after TEST in the file output. The Filter appears to be receiving TEST twice and should be returning true each time, but is only logged to file once which is what I was originally expecting. The first codeNPEcode returns true the first time, and then false the second time as its hash is now in the set, however nothing is added to the output file. Subsequent NPEs only call the filter once according to the console, returning false each time as expected.p  pIf I addp  precodeif true    return true  codepre  pafter the initial debug output in LogFilter, then the filter still claims to receive each message twice according to the console output, but does so for all subsequent NPEs after the first, unlike beforehand. TEST and both NPEs are recorded in the log file once each in this case so thats TEST, NPE1 and NPE2.p  pIf I remove the filter entirely dont add it in the first place, then all codeLevel.WARNINGcode and higher LogRecords make it into the log file as in the previous test, they only appear once each in the file.p  pstrongmain plugin classstrongp  precodepackage uk.co.mysterymayhem.bukkittestplugin

Negative 25219 pIm trying out MVVM with a simple project using WPF and Ive got the grips on mostly how the pattern works and their intentions. However, one of my problem now is how navigation is done in MVVM. For example, when I have a navigation pane and I need to show a UserControl on the rightside of a window based on what item is clicked on the navigation pane. Or showing a new window.p  pHow is this done in MVVM Ive browsed the internet but all implementations I see uses IoC containers. I want to implement the application without these frameworks as I want to understand how it works. Some have mentioned using controllers for navigation but I cant seem to find a simple and short example.p  pBasically, I need a short and simple example of how it navigation is done in WPF MVVM.p

Negative 25219 pHello ive got a question for you. I know java a little bit and i need your help. I am trying to process image by multi threading. The idea is simple. I load pixel by pixel in threads, then store it in bufferedImage object, then save. I am going to use fixed nubmer of threads.p  pThis is my way to achieve it. I am posting links due to long codep  pa hrefhttppastebin.comzuD9JTxn relnofollowhttppastebin.comzuD9JTxna a hrefhttppastebin.comFBZzsG2i relnofollowhttppastebin.comFBZzsG2iap  pNow every thread after calculating new rgb value for particular pixel, sends it to App. I wish i could store it in array, then send it all to app, then merge with other threads. Is this possiblep
Negative 25219 pIve been searching for any insight into best practices for making sure there is consistency with my keys in a dictionary. The dictionary is used throughout multiple classes, so there is a main class that stores the dictionary for access from each class.p  pMy question really is this multiple classes access this codeDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode and the set of keys about 40 in total are always the same. Right now I am accessing the values through codedictionary[keyname]code, but I was wondering if it would be a better practice to use use const strings to store these keys or if there was a more effective way to reduce the chance of introducing errors through misspelling and to make it easier to keep track of the keys. The keys need to be strings or need to be quickly convertible to strings as they are also used in a multipart form for submission to a web service.p  pThanks for any insightp

Negative 25219 pI have a Simulink model being compiled to an executable through Embedded Coder RTW and have an SFunction that I know has no connection between the input and output so would like to turn off direct feedthrough on its input port. I could in fact make two SFunctions to replace it, one with an input, one with an output, the only complication is the external system I am addressing does its twoway communication in a single function call.p  pWe currently use the Legacy Code Tool to compile all of our SFunctions, but this I have read and verified forces all inputs to be direct feedthrough whether they are or not with no explanation of why. I have had a look as the SFunction Builder block, however it makes no reference to direct feedthrough on inputs. I have also looked at the msfuntmplbasic.m template  builder script however it seems to be limited to inputs and outputs with primitive data types via the DatatypeID.p

Negative 25219 pa hrefhttpwww.filedropper.comforcheck21 relnofollowSample Excelap  pHi Guys,p  pI am having a bit of trouble with my excel macro. Theres a part of code wherein it compares cells from sheet1 to sheet2. The issue is even when a cell in sheet1 matches the cell in sheet2 it still shows as NOT MATCH.p  pI believe that one of the cells, either ValueA or ValueB, has hidden characters in it. Their contents came from different sources. I tried doing CLEAN formula but that didnt help. Any ideas PLEASE SEE LINKED FILE ABOVE. I copied and pasted the 2 values AS IS so you can test what could be hidden.p  pI am dealing with a large rows of data so I dont want to be using DO WHILE in VBA. Is there a formula or code to leave just visible characters and SPACE in a cellp  pp  pa hrefhttpwww.filedropper.comforcheck21 relnofollowSample2ap  pHeres another sample, this is taken from the master file itself so its close to the original. As you can see, there is a formula in sheet1 column B that checks if each of the Record ID already exists in sheet2. All of them say NOT FOUND Doesnt exist in sheet2 but many of them actually already exists in sheet2 including Record ID 1743840. If you do a manual CTRLF to find that Record ID in sheet2 youll see its there and the FIND system works, but the formula isnt.p
Negative 25219 pI have a 1320x1320 spritesheet, each individual image is 120x120, 121 total images. I have been using this formula to set the backgroundposition up until nowp  pcodeimage[i].style.backgroundPosition  120i  px   Math.floori11120  pxcodep  pNow that Im close to finishing my project, I wanted to update some of the quick fixes I made, so that I dont use 121 Math.floors to load all the images, and so its easier to update them in the future without having to rearrange all the images in the spritesheet to be in alphabetical order when I add new ones. So I went and used a program to generate the current css positions for all my images, for examplep  pcode.image[1]600px 480px .image[2]1200px 840px .image[3]1200px 720px .image[4]1200px 600pxcodep  pbut the problem with this is, if I change the backgroundsize, it completely ruins the position for all the images. Theres an instance where I load all the images at once, so the user can select one of them, but to show 121 images at once I need to downsize it a little, so I go from 120x120 to 72x72 with backgroundsize, but the positioning gets ruined with the new method, does anyone have a work around to this p  pAll the backgroundsize  backgroundposition issue threads Ive seen have been about percentages and something entirely different than what Im having. p

Negative 25219 pOk, Im not even sure if that is the right question to ask. Ive been confused by what is A Graphics object for a while now, I used to think that it is simplly a tool to use to change colors and draw to specific containerie JFrame, JPanel. However, Ive been studying bufferingtriple, double, flipping...etc and how it works for 3 days now, and my confusion has only increased. for instance, why when we need to draw to the bufferie BufferStrategy, BufferedImage we get its own graphics object to draw to it and then we project it to the screen does the Graphics Object represent the drawing surface ie the JPanel it self if were using one to draw custom painting via codeJPanelpaintComponentGraphics gcode   and so when were getting the graphics object of a buffer, do we actually get its drawing surface to paint on Please somebody explain, any help is appreciated Thanksp

Negative 25219 pI have a text box widget that I use just to print debug data to and I want to change the background color for each line of text within the text box widget to make things easier to read.  I have been looking at how to highlight text with the text box widget, but cannot seem to figure out how to get the background color for each line to change.  Is it possible to do thisp  pSo far I have tried using tags, but I think Im misunderstanding how to use them or something because Im having trouble getting any results.  The searches I have done on google come up with questions regarding highlighting specific words, and I couldnt find any similar scenarios to work off of.p  pIf anybody knows of some resources I can look at, or could point me in the right direction, that would be wonderful.  An example would be even better, but I dont expect anybody to do the legwork for me.p  pThanksp
Negative 25219 pIve developed a MVVM WPF application which runs on a Windows 2012 server. The user logs in  and use the application using remote desktop mstsc. My application contains a ViewModel containing 3 string properties. I have a DataTemplate on that ViewModel containing 3 TextBoxes.p  pMy problem is that if, for a reason, the user is disconnected from the server, the focused TextBox when the user reconnects is lost and the focus is moved to the Window. So if the user was focused on the TextBox2 when disconnecting, when he reconnects the focus is lost and no textbox are focused.p  pThe problem seems to happen when the DataTemplate is applied. Upon reconnecting, the server seems to force a rerender of the application.p  pIf I dont use a DataTemplate, the focus is kept and the user can continue from where he was before disconnecting.p  pAnyone has any idea why or how I can work around that behaviourp  pMy ViewModelp  precodeusing System.Windows  namespace FocusOnDisconnectWpfApplication.ViewModels      public class TestViewModel  DependencyObject              public string Test1                      get  return stringGetValueTest1Property              set  SetValueTest1Property, value                    public string Test2                      get  return stringGetValueTest2Property              set  SetValueTest2Property, value                    public string Test3                      get  return stringGetValueTest3Property              set  SetValueTest3Property, value                    public static readonly DependencyProperty Test1Property              DependencyProperty.RegisterTest1, typeofstring, typeofTestViewModel          public static readonly DependencyProperty Test2Property              DependencyProperty.RegisterTest2, typeofstring, typeofTestViewModel          public static readonly DependencyProperty Test3Property              DependencyProperty.RegisterTest3, typeofstring, typeofTestViewModel       codepre  pMy Viewp  precodeltResourceDictionary xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation                     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml                     xmlnsViewModelsclrnamespaceFocusOnDisconnectWpfApplication.ViewModelsgt      ltDataTemplate DataTypexType ViewModelsTestViewModelgt         ltGridgt             ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltRowDefinition gt                 ltRowDefinition gt                 ltRowDefinition gt             ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt              ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentCenter                      VerticalAlignmentCenter                      TextBinding Test3                      Width500 gt             ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentCenter                      VerticalAlignmentCenter                      TextBinding Test3                      Width500                      Grid.Row1 gt             ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentCenter                      VerticalAlignmentCenter                      TextBinding Test3                      Width500                      Grid.Row2 gt         ltGridgt     ltDataTemplategt  ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pEditbr So to add to my question, Ive tested what events were fired on Windows Server 2012 and 2008.br br On Windows Server 2012br OnInitializedbr OnApplyTemplatebr OnLoadedbr OnContentRenderedbr OnSessionSwitchbr OnSessionSwitchbr OnApplyTemplatebr br On Windows Server 2008br OnInitializedbr OnApplyTemplatebr OnLoadedbr OnContentRenderedbr OnSessionSwitchbr OnSessionSwitchbr br As you can see on 2008, OnApplyTemplate is not fired when you reconnect.br Im still in the dark here, any help is appreciated.p

Negative 25219 pI was doing some studying on CodeSchool. While watching a tutorial I was confused by an example. What they were trying to explain in the video was that closures created in loops wont bind until the last minute. The aim for this code was to take a name check for it in the array and return the name alone with its positionwithout the zero convention. Since closures dont bind till the last minute this code is returning codez 5code. I am confused why this code is returning a 5 and not a 4. The length of my array is 4 and the for loop stops before 4 because codei lt passengerArray.lengthcode which is the equivalent of codei lt 4code therefore the last index checked should be codepassengerArray[3]code which means my codei1code should be 4 in the end and not 5.

Negative 25219 pFirst of all, this is not about memory mapped file.p  pI implemented minifilter driver from ms minifilter sample swapbuffer. And successfully swapped some specific data when IRPMJWRITE is passed in. But when the system cache is emptied i.e, reboot all swapped buffer was not applied to the file. I checked right after buffer swapped and It was perfectly swapped. But after I empty the system cache, Its gone. How is this possible Minifilter driver cant change anything to the buffer to write on diskp  pI dont know exactly but I can guess that this is about the windows cache and memory manager. But must it apply the swapped content when its cache is being empty Im gonna read the book NT file system internal to find out, but anyone in here may be able to show me the the reason.p

Negative 25219 pI need to use hibernate in my projects and I need a better code completion when editing HTML file or JSF file, so I installed Jboss Tools from the Eclipse Marketplace. I use this combo since 2010 , but since last update I am experiencing some random out of memory error in eclipse. Ive edited the config file to enhance the heap and the perm space, but even with more then 3gb dedicated, the error still persist.p  pIs anyone experiencing this Has anyone found a solution p  pI think there are a lot of people with the same issue, because even after a fresh installation of both ide and plugin the issue persists.p  pOn google I cant find anything useful and I dont think the solution is not incrementing the heap much more, because the memory inspector shows an usage of less then 300MB and my heap is 3GB at the moment. When the error occurs the heap space is blown up instantly from 300MB to 3GB and after a bunch of second the ide shows the error popup. After the error, the heap became less than 300MB.p  pNOTE The issue is manifesting with jdk 1.7, 1.8 all the updates of this and last year and on a Windows PC it happens with both Windows 7 and Windows 88.1 p

Negative 25219 pThis is getting weird. Ship inherits from Entity and MerchantShip from Ship, other types are to be added later, but the basic idea, and what is asked by the professor, is that I use polymorphism, so that I can work on a collection of the main class pointer with allocated memory used as an array in my implementation, thus there is a virtual void update in all three of the later classes. In fact I have used all combinations of virtual and nonvirtual functions that could make sense.

Negative 25219 pI have a table in a MySQL database containing a relatively low number of records5075, and I often need to use all of the records at once in my PHP code in the form of a multidimensional array. Now, as I rarely modify the records in the table, but need to use them very often in my PHP code, I would like to eliminate the need to read the records from the database every time I need them by making the page I use to modify the records generate valid PHP code containing the records. I would then simply include the generated code instead of connecting to and reading from the database anytime I need to.p  pTo sum it up I want to know how to, in PHP, take the entire contents of a MySQL table and write them in the form of a PHP array, such as this onep  precoderowsarray     arrayidgt1, namegtapples, amountgt250kg,     arrayidgt2, namegtoranges, amountgt89kg,     arrayidgt3, namegtbananas, amountgt4, ...     arrayidgt66, namegtpotatoes, amountgt6t codepre  pAside from the answer on how to do it, I would also like to know is it smart to do it Would this open up any security holes, will it make my code run faster, and is there any other way to do thisp

So I have like p  precode url appmod1mod2, codepre  pin my route and as the user interacts with buttons on the page, 2 of them are binded to scopes in the controllers, lets sayp  precode scope.mod1  true  scope.mod2  false codepre  pAnd then as the user interacts with them it would change the url accordingly. So if they clicked the buttons and made mod1  false and mod2  true, the url would change top  precodeappfalsetrue codepre  pHere is the catch  I would love to be able to do this without refreshing the page each time if its even possible in the first place. The idea is so that the user can then copy the url and use it later  kind of like a save state. Any advice on this matter would be much valued, as I am not sure where to look.

Negative 25219 pI am trying to discover the best way of avoiding UILockups when you are doing a lot of updates to the UI at once.p  pThe basic premise is that on start up my tool runs a perforce FSTAT on the within a background worker. This generates a very large list of files and their information. Once this is completed, in its RunWorkerCompleted function, I then propagate this information to the UI inside of a TreeView.p  pThis however, involves lots of property updates Depending on the number of files that its propagating to. It can be 5000 files. This completely locks up the UI for about 35 seconds.p  pI was wondering if I can asynchronously update the UI, such that I say, propagate 1020 files at once amp Still let the UI thread continue to update so that its still responsive.p  pThank you.p

Negative 25219 pWere having trouble getting the performance we need out of SQL Azure, and Im curious if anyone has tried using Active GeoReplication to split read and write loads for performance, either successfully or unsuccessfullyp  pOne of our databases seems to be a great fit for this. The only writes occurring on this database are from an application that downloads data updates as xml files from a 3rd party service it processes those files to update the data. Files come in frequently and the app executes anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand inserts and updates each minute. The app is provided by our data provider. Improvements to their updater, like batching insert amp update statements, is not an option right now. Their updater is written in perl and uses ODBC. Weve updated to the latest ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server to enable connection retries in the connection string.p  pReads occur from our .Net web service. The queries it executes are pretty heavy with lots of joins. Weve done a fair amount of tuning and caching to reduce the load on our DB. When we were running it on SQL Server installed on some middleoftheroad leased server hardware we were well within capacity. Now were over on SQL Azure and seeing slow processing even at a Premium P2 level. Going to P3 is cost prohibitive at this time.p  pEarlier today I set up the active readable secondary, and Im not seeing what I expect. The only thing connecting to our writable master is the updater app. Our web service is connecting to the readable secondary. However, Azures portal show all the load on our masterp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVVcXq.png altPrimary DB old portal img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlJqI6.png altPrimary DB new portalp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQFrRu.png altSecondary DB old portal img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv2nVr.png altSecondary DB new portalp  pI also note that our average DTU percent used is up about 20 since setting up the active secondary.p  pIf I execute codeSELECT SUMexecutioncount FROM sys.dmexecquerystatscode I get close to the same number of total executions on each DB. If I sit and refresh codeSELECT  FROM sys.dmexecrequests CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecsqltextsqlhandlecode I also see a similar number of queries running on each DB. Furthermore, our read queries use views we created, and I am seeing our queries on each DB  not just queries the updating app runs it has no idea about our views.p  pCan anyone help me understand what is going on here If those 2 queries didnt show executions on the secondary, Id say we arent even connecting to it. We went from one P2 DB at like 6070 DTU to two P2 DBs with one at like 90 DTU and one at 0 DTU. So now were paying twice as much and appears we have even less resources available to us.p  pAre we wrong in thinking that we should have 2x P2 total DTUs here Does Azure only give you one databases worth of resources for an active georeplicated set Is the stats somehow combined that Im not really seeing whats hitting each individual database with those queriesp

Negative 25219 pI want a singleton accessible to the whole request and only to calls from that request.  p  pI have a client with a requirement that the builtin server side session not be used. Instead I need to rebuild the UserSession object each time based on the requests cookies and query string and validate it with the database. There is some overhead in building the UserSession object, so I want to do it only once per request, as early as possible, and then reference that object later throughout the request.  p  pCurrently I am using OWIN middleware to call the facade object that actually builds it and then I am sticking the result in a classs static field decorated with [ThreadStatic]. I then use a custom Authorize attribute on my controllers to inspect that singleton to make sure it is valid.p  pstrongFirststrong, is this secure across multiple requests Stated differently, does the use of [ThreadStatic] ensure that each requests static object can never be accessed by another HTTP request, even from the same browser session.  p  pstrongSecondstrong, could I run into issues with using the TPL or other asyncronous programming approaches where the singleton instance should be available because it is the same request, but it is not because it might be executing on a different thread. p  pstrongLastlystrong, am I doing wrong Is there a better or precanned solution to this problem than what I am doing.p

Negative 25219 pI wrote a simple client and server to work with outofband data. The client just sends a single out of band data to the server and the server uses SIGURG to handle this single byte. The server also should handle normal traffic in an infinite loop. The code has a race condition which does not work as expected. Sometimes I get an Invalid argument from a call to recv in the SIGURG handler. Another question I have is that should I block SIGURG signal when calling accept Also, which one is the preferred scenariop  ul liinstall SIGURG handler and set the socket owner for the listening socket embeforeem calling accept.li liinstall SIGURG handler and set the socket owner for the connected socket emafterem calling accept.li liif none of the above, please write your suggestion.li ul  pMy last question is, since the client sends the outofband data immediately, is there a chance for the server to receive the SIGURG just after the completion of threeway handshake, but before returning from accept If so, I think the clifd var can has an invalid value when it is used in the SIGURG handler.p  pthe code for the clientp  precodeinclude myheader.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]      struct sockaddrin saddr     int sockfd      const char c  a      if 2  argc              fprintfstderr, Usage s ipaddrn, argv[0]         exitEXITFAILURE           if 1  sockfd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0         diesockfd      voidmemsetampsaddr, 0, sizeofsaddr      saddr.sinfamily  AFINET     saddr.sinport  htonsPORT      if 1  inetptonAFINET, argv[1], ampsaddr.sinaddr         dieinetpton      if 1  connectsockfd, struct sockaddrampsaddr, sizeofsaddr         dieconnect    if 1  sendsockfd, HELLOn, 6, 0       diesend      if 1  sendsockfd, ampc, 1, MSGOOB         diesend      closesockfd      return 0  codepre  pand the code for the serverp  precodeinclude myheader.h  void sigurghandlerint  char    oob int sockfd, clifd  int mainvoid      struct sockaddrin myaddr     char buf[BUFSIZ]     ssizet nbytes     sigsett sset, oset     sigemptysetampsset     sigaddsetampsset, SIGURG      if 1  sockfd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0         diesocket      voidmemsetampmyaddr, 0, sizeofmyaddr      myaddr.sinfamily  AFINET     myaddr.sinport  htonsPORT     myaddr.sinaddr.saddr  htonlINADDRANY      if 1  bindsockfd, struct sockaddrampmyaddr, sizeofmyaddr         diebind      if 1  listensockfd, BACKLOG         dielisten      if 1  fcntlsockfd, FSETOWN, getpid         diefcntl      if SIGERR  signalSIGURG, sigurghandler             diesignal     for                block SIGURG when accepting the connection        sigprocmaskSIGSETMASK, ampsset, amposet         printfbloking in acceptn         if 1  clifd  acceptsockfd, NULL, NULL             dieaccept           unblock SIGURG        sigprocmaskSIGSETMASK, amposet, NULL          printfrecving normal datan         nbytes  recvclifd, buf, sizeofbuf, 0         buf[nbytes]  0  nullterminate           printfs, buf            closesockfd   void sigurghandlerint signo      char buff[100]     ssizet nbytes      printfSIGURG receivedn     if clifd  0              if 1  nbytes  recvclifd, buff, sizeofbuff  1, MSGOOB             dierecv in sigurghandler          buff[nbytes]  0         printffrom sigurghandler received sn, buff          else              printfclifd  dn, clifd         exit1       codepre  pExamplep  precodegt .serv  bloking in accept          first client  SIGURG received from sigurghandler received a recving normal data bloking in accept          second client  SIGURG received recv in sigurghandler Invalid argument gt .serv              third client  bloking in accept SIGURG received clifd  0 gt codepre

Negative 25219 pWe are getting the below error when we change the android phone orientation. Currently testing this in android v 5 and 4.4.4. Our app is locked to portrait. So if we twist the phone to landscape mode, the view will  not get changed but remain in portrait mode.p  pThis exception is thrown and the app crashes when we change the phone orientation to landscape. This will not be able to replicate always. But once in 10 or 15 times, app crashes with the below error. Even if it is random, this can be replicated constantly. Might be if we twist the phone at any particular time but not sure. I frequently get this when I twist the phone during the login or logout actions which takes a couple of seconds to complete these actions.p  pThis exception is not thrown from a particular activity or piece of code.

Negative 25219 pCurrently I understand flyway has commandline support. We, as developer or devops   we deploy automatically with jenkins and standard tool chain we have. p  pIssues is when we do application release, We have to apply DB patches. We can definitely automate them But process at our organization says we have DBA that needs to review your sql before you apply. p  pWe know its relatively useless, But we still need to support that. Can you suggest a way of doing these  I mean can  does flyway have hooks that tell us list of migration sql will be applied  and print on screen or something ,then DBA can execute the same  p  pOr can we do some addon to do the same p  pWould really appreciate help here from flyway team.p  pThis is only thing stops us from using flyway in real application.p

Negative 25219 pIve been working with modping on ejabberd, and could observe thisp  ul lipcodepingintervalcode Secondsbr How often to send pings to connected clients, if the previous option is enabled. If a client connection does not send or receive any stanza in this interval, a ping request is sent to the client. The default value is 60 seconds. pli lipcodetimeoutactioncode codenonecodecodekillcodebr What to do when a client does not answer to a server ping request in less than 32 seconds. The default is to do nothing.pli ul  pFor now, I have the ping interval as 15 seconds. A smaller value would drain the battery of mobile clients, as has been observed.p  pSo, gauging a bit I changed the strongIQTIMEOUT value from 32 seconds to 5 secondsstrong a smaller value. This closes my connection with a relatively smaller wait now. This is a change in the wait time for receiving acknowledgement from the connected peer i.e. if the ack is not received within 5 seconds, the socket is closed by ejabberd now.p  pI am anxious if this impacts any other functionality of ejabberdp  pWhat are the drawbacks of setting up a small value such as 5 seconds in my casep

Negative 25219 pIm currently updating an app that I didnt build but have been working with for a little while, keep in mind Im very new to iOS programming. The app uploads work orders to a client server when they are completed using NSURLConnection, if it has no connection it will queue them up and then wait for a connection to do the upload. This is fine unless the app is backgrounded, as often times the user will forget to open the app back up to complete the upload. p  pApples email app doesnt have this problem, it will complete uploads even while the app is backgrounded if it finds a connection and notifies the user with that whoosh sound. Im not sure how that is done in the background as Apple seems to prevent most actions when backgrounded. Is something like that possible using NSURLConnection or will I need to convert everything to use NSURLSession or something similarp  pI dont see this topic coming up on google so Im wondering if somebody could point me in a helpful direction.

Negative 25219 pI have an xeditable form with several fields in it. Ive only show the checkbox field here for brevity. There is an edit button that opens all of the elements for editing and when I click submit all of the elements are saved. While in edit mode I want to be able to call a function when the checkbox is clicked before submitting the form. It will be for validation to make sure the user really wants to uncheck the box. I want to prevent the default behavior of the checkbox and display a dialog for confirmation. This is simple with a regular checkbox but I can figure out how to do it with xeditable . ngclick doesnt seem to work.

Negative 25219 pRight now I have such forma hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com8Mtwf.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8Mtwf.png altenter image description hereap  pThe aim, that Im trying to reach, is to open another form based on codeblockidcode value by pressing button. And it works. But blockid value in textblock should be based on three other values in the form codeNtablecode, codetargettablecode and codesourcetablecode. In the attached picture can be seen blockids textblock form options.  Source values for that textblock is query with name codes2code, and I tried to limit codeblockidcode value by setting filter here this wayp  precode[s2].[Ntable][Form1].[0] AND  [s2].[targettable][Form1].[2] AND  [s2].[sourcetable][Form1].[4] codepre  pThere codes2code is the query name, codeForm1code is the name of current form, code0code and so on is the just list of values for first 3 textboxes. However that doesnt work at all. So codeblockidcode is independent. That is wrong here and how it can be fixedp  pPS Im really sorry for not english language in the attached picture, I cant change the language. And I tried to deal with the problem by using codeEvent Processingcode macros but failed.p

Negative 25219 pI developed a site with a registration form and this form uses a captcha. Now Im developing a Java desktop application that make possible for an user to register my site through the application. The application should present a registration form with same fields of the site, and for this I have no problem. But the site need a captcha, so I would like to show the captcha sent from site on my desktop application. If I use a crawler like JSoup I need to redownload the captcha image, and my captcha system on site changes the image at every request. In this way captcha image will always be incorrect. The idea to create a different, captcha free, registration request to the site is a bad choice. How can I achieve thisp
