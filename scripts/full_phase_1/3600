Positive 3600 pIm using the code below JQuery to delay the loading of a div until after the strongentirestrong page has loaded code, images, etc and rendered. It is working in Safari and Firefox, but not in Chrome. On Safari and Firefox, the web page loads and renders everything, and then it loads the div the Facebook embed after the browser says everything is loaded loader stops spinning, page content is shown, browsers developer tools say everything is loaded  not just DOM. In Chrome, though, it just loads at the end after DOM content but before everything is loaded and shown like it does in Safari and Firefox, which is how it is supposed to and how I want it to work. I would greatly appreciate any help on making this work in Chrome like it does in the other browsers I asked yesterday, but the answer I was provided didnt fix the issue for me, and I perhaps wasnt clear about what I wanted perhaps mistaken for only after DOM was loaded so I decided to put it up again so it was more clear.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt    function insertFB var htmlltdiv classfbpage datahrefhttpswww.facebook.combobcaputolivingwell datasmallheaderfalse dataadaptcontainerwidthtrue datahidecoverfalse datashowfacepiletrue datashowpoststruegtltdiv classfbxfbmlparseignoregtltblockquote citehttpswww.facebook.combobcaputolivingwellgtlta hrefhttpswww.facebook.combobcaputolivingwellgtBob Caputo Living Wellltagtltblockquotegtltdivgtltdivgt FBPAGE.htmlhtml   if document.addEventListener document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, insertFB, false      if WebKiti.testnavigator.userAgent var timer  setIntervalfunction ifloadedcomplete.testdocument.readyState insertFB  ,10     window.onload  insertFB    ltscriptgt codepre

Positive 3600 pI have checked each and every question and article about this, that I could find, but nothing really answers it. I make it sound as if I have just one question, theres more of them.p  pMaybe I should first explain what I am trying to do, I am building a File Manager entirely in JavaScript, the File Manager receives files from Backend PHP, Twig, it then stores them in an array of Folder, each Folder has its own Files, Folders is an Array, and Files in each Folder is an Array as well, these Files are also shown on the page, and the user can select, copy, cut, paste  other operations  them  I am still writing these operations, because here lies the problem .br Files on page have dataid assigned to them, so that I can easily operate on them between File Manager and the Backend, and because I know the ID of every and each file, I think I could completely eliminate traversing through Arrays of Files in search of a particular File, if I could only create an Array that would take the ID of a File as an Index, and because this is JavaScript, I can do that but there are some problems with it.p  pTrying to use an Object for this task just does not work, because it is just way slower than Array  now, I understand, that the differences in speed, even if in millions, are not that big, but why not try to dig for ultimate performance, right  p  pSo here is a list of questions, that I cannot seem to find a reliable answer top  ol liWhy is Object on Chrome so much faster, than Object on Firefox li liWhy is accessing an undefined index on Chrome so much slower li liWhy is Array so much faster on Firefox, than on Chrome li liI know why Chrome loses performance with higher indexes  at 100k it transforms the array into a list, I think, it was answered with a link to source in another question on SO , but Firefox loses performance gradually as if it traveresed to higher indexes sequentially, even if accessed directly, why is that li liWhy is an Array extermely slow when there is only one element in it, but that element is at a very high index li ol  pThere are probably some more questions I have, but I cannot think of them right now.p  hr  pThe fastest configuration I found, that supports IDs as indexes and holes between them, as well as starting at a high index, is using an Array that holds the data you want to store, and another array, that just holds the indexes, so that when you are searching for an object with ID 10, you touch the index Array, instead of the Array with data. br You can see an example of this in a hrefhttpjsperf.comarraymanagementperformance2 relnofollowhttpjsperf.comarraymanagementperformance2a.p  pEDIT If you want to see the performance degradation, please review this jsperf and change minId and maxId to some big numebers.p  hr  pHere are some statsp  pObjectp  pRead Defined Firefox 165.173 mln opssec  Chrome 351.699 mln opssecbr Read Undefined Firefox 98.582 mln opssec  Chrome 54.666 mln opssecbr Write Close Firefox 7.599 mln opssec  Chrome 291.244 mln opssecbr Write Far Firefox 5.599 mln opssec  Chrome 93.733 mln opssecbr Write Overwrite Firefox 7.599 mln opssec  Chrome 291.244 mln opssecbrp  pArrayp  pRead Defined Firefox 681.206 mln opssec  Chrome 401.522 mln opssecbr Read Undefined Firefox 681.206 mln opssec  Chrome 62.827 mln opssecbr Write Close Firefox 400.234 mln opssec  Chrome 121.519 mln opssecbr Write Far Firefox 348.560 mln opssec  Chrome 121.519 mln opssecbr Write Overwrite Firefox 400.234 mln opssec  Chrome 234.337 mln opssecbrp  pP.S.

What it needs to be able to do is determine the current open dialog save as window and then change the name and set the folder to save to. Actually, even just being able to click the save button keeping the default name and location would be fine too. I could just rename and move it afterward. I did see win32 but Im not sure if thats the best option. Im on Windows 7.p  pEDIT 1012015p  pTried a few things and I can operate the save button in the save as dialog by sending a keyboard Return using keybdevent. p  precode    win32api.keybdeventwin32con.VKRETURN, 0  codepre  pProblem now is that the default save location is not my Downloads folder when I click the button. Its an application directory where Google Chrome is. Likely some temp location. CProgram FilesGoogleChromeApplication45.0.2454.101. On to trying to figure out how to change the location.p

Negative 3600 pWhile talking to a colleague about a particular group of apps using up nearly 1.5G memory on startup... he pointed me to a very good link on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms954594.aspx relnofollow.NET production debuggingap  pThe part that has me puzzled is ...p  blockquote   pFor example, if you allocate 1 MB of   memory to a single block, the large   object heap expands to 1 MB in size.   When you free this object, the large   object heap does not decommit the   virtual memory, so the heap stays at 1   MB in size. If you allocate another   500KB block later, the new block is   allocated within the 1 MB block of   memory belonging to the large object   heap. During the process lifetime, the   large object heap always grows to hold   all the large block allocations   currently referenced, but never   shrinks when objects are released,   even if a garbage collection occurs.   Figure 2.4 on the next page shows an   example of a large object heap.p blockquote  pNow lets say we have a fictional app that creates a flurry of large objects   85KB, so the large object heap grows lets say to 200 Meg. Now lets say we have 10 such app instances running.. so that 2000 Megs allocated.

The ID number of the square that the cube currently occupies on is stored in a storagevariable. This is so that I can tell whether or not adjacent squares are free for the cube to move onto. When I move the cube, the storagevariable is updated to reflect the ID number of the new square.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrongbr The problem is that sometimes when I am moving the cube, the cube is moved too far or in the wrong direction and the square in the storagevariable does not match the actual square the cube is drawn on...This causes problems like the cube not detecting collisions and even going through objects it is not supposed to....p  pCube is drawn in a drawView method in an iPhone OpenGL ES EAGLView at a rate of 24 times per second...Could the fast drawing be the cause of this How can I fix this My job depends on it...p  pSomebody please help.p

Negative 3600 pI am new to C, C and .Net.p  pI am currently returning to programming from a stint in Networking and Cisco engineering. I used to program on IBM mainframes etc using Cobol, assembler, easytrieve, Rexx and clist etc so the command syntax is reasonably familiar to me as are programming standards and structures.p  pHowever I am having quite a bit of trouble getting to grips with the BCL and understanding the various components and what each is designed for and which is best to use in various situations, and in fact how some are actually used and coded. p  pI am often scratching my head wondering how the code came about from the descriptions I have found about the BCL components. Basically how to use them and code them seems to be a black art with no intuitive means at all.p  pSo my question is, apart from the msdn library, which I am finding to be a bit over complicated for my current needs, is there any good reference book, site, pdf that can give me a reasonable description, usage notes etc of the most commonly used .NET components such as System.IO etc p  pI have read a few book on C etc and have found a small program that does part of what I need to do in a project I have, requiring acces to devices via RS232 ports, but when decoding the program I find myself wondering why the person used the components he did and how would I know which components I should use when I make the changes I need to and add in the extra code that I require and how do I actually use these components when I do find them p  pI do realise a lot of this will be down to plain old experience, but a helping hand in the right direction would really help a lot.p  pMany thanks, George.p

Negative 3600 pIve been using PHP for about 4 years, however Ive come across a problem that requires something with slightly P better performance and so Ive chosen C.p  pThe program Im writing is a Linux daemon that will scan a MySql database for URLs to load, load them using cURL, search for a specified string, and then update the database accordingly. The problem that Im facing is that I dont know the size of the data that needs to be stored in a variable in order to be searched for a specific string.p  pI had the idea of using a linked list and allocating more nodes as the data fills the list. Is this a good way to go about doing thingsp  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 3600 pSo, Im building a WPF app and did a test deployment today, and found that it performed pretty poorly.  I was surprised, as we are really not doing much in the way of visual effects or animations.p  pI deployed on two machines the fastest and the slowest that will need to run the application the slowest PC has an Intel Celeron 1.80GHz with 2GB RAM.  The application ran pretty well on the faster machine, but was choppy on the slower machine.  And when I say choppy, I mean the cursor jumped even just passing it over any open window of the app that had focus.p  pI opened the Task Manager Performance window, and could see that the CPU usage jumped whenever the app had focus and the cursor was moving over it.  If I gave focus to another e.g. Excel, the CPU usage went back down after a second.  This happened on both machines, but the choppiness was only noticeable on the slower machine.  I had very limited time to tinker on the deployment machines, so didnt do a lot of detailed testing.p  pThe app runs fine on my development machine, but I also see the CPU spiking up to 10 there, just running the cursor over the window.p  pI downloaded the WPF performance tool from MS and have been tinkering with it on my dev machine.  The docs say this about the Frame Rate metric in the Perforator toolp  blockquote   pFor applications without animation,   this value should be near 0.p blockquote  pThe app is not doing any heavy animation, but the frame rate stays near 50 when the cursor is over any window.  The screens I tested on have column headers in a grid that highlight and buttons that change color and appearance when scrolled over.  Even moving the mouse on blank areas of the windows cause the same Frame rate and CPU usage doesnt seem to be related to these minor animations.p  pAlso, I am unable to figure out how to get anything but the two default toolsPerforator and Visual Profilerinstalled into the WPF performance tool.  That is probably a separate question.p  pI also have Redgates profiling tool, but Im not sure if that can shed any light on rendering performance.p  pSo, I realize this is not an easy thing to troubleshoot without specifics or sample code which I cant post.   My questions arep  ul liWhat are some general things to look for or avoid in the code to improve performanceli liWhat steps can I take using the WPF performance tool to narrow down the problem li liIs the PC spec listed above Intel Celeron 1.80GHz with 2GB RAM too slow to be running even vanilla WPF applicationsli ul

Currently using C we try to create a graph based direct show like cross platform library that would be helpful in live video broadcasting and processing. Our graph elements currently use char and int pairs for data exchange. To cast data to subscribed elements we use raw memcpy now. I want to go further and make it possible for us to make our graph elements base C template. So that one graph element would be capable of of sharing current graph element data with other Graph elements and that data it shares would be a structure that would contain not one char one int but any number of data fields and nearly any elements inside. So that is why I need to understand how to create a basic C structure that implements  copy constructor and assignment operator for me to be capable to use new for us data casting algorithms likep  precodevoid CastDataT item     forsizet i  0  i lt FuncVec.size i         T dataCopy  item         FuncVec[i]dataCopy       codepre  pinstead of currently usedp  precodevoid CastDatachar  data, int length     forsizet i  0  i lt FuncVec.size i         char dataCopy  new char[length]         memcpydataCopy, data, length         FuncVec[i]dataCopy, length                     delete[] dataCopy       codepre

Very nice. The problem is when the client disconnects midstream either gracefully or ungracefully. In either case, the server doesnt get notified of this disconnect other than as a fault picked up by the services error handler.p  pAs you can see, Ive tried hooking the Faulted and Closed channel events in the service method but they are not firing when the client disconnects.p  pI suspect that these events dont fire because with a streaming contract the service has already returned from the operation method GetStreamingData. This method has returned a Message with a custom bodywriter and its this bodywrite that lower in the service channel stack is grabbing results from the calculation thread via an IEnumerable and streaming them in to the reply message. Since the operation method has returned then Im guessing these channel events dont get fire.p  pThe binding is a customized version of net.tcp binding nonduplex with only two binding elements BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement and TcpTransportBindingElement. No security or anything. Basically just raw net.tcp with binary messages.p  pThe problem is that when a client disconnects, I want the server to stop the background calculation thread that is generating results and feeding them into the IEnumerable being read by the BodyWriter. The body writer has stopped obviously, but the thread continues to live.p  pSo where can I hook to discover if a client has disconnected midstreamp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThere are two main disconnection cases Explicit disconnection, due either to the disposal of the client proxy or termination of the process at the client Passive disconnection, usually due to a network failure example ISP drops the connection, or the network cable gets yanked.p  pIn the first case, there is an explicit connection exception that gets received by the server when it tries to send new data down the stream. No problem.p  pThe second scenario of a broken network pipe is more troublesome. Usually this condition is detected based on the Send timeout, but since this is a streaming interface the send timeout is cranked way up I have it cranked to several days since it is conceivable that streaming data transfers could last that long. So when a client is disconnected due to a flaky network pipe, the service continues to send data down a connection that does really exist any more.p  pAt this point I dont know of a good way to resolve the second option.

Negative 3600 pI am working on a django project in which I create a set of three abstract models that I will use for a variety of apps later on.

Negative 3600 pI am an MVC noob, but trying to implement best practices and keeping as little code in a view as possible.

Status Inactive   Mark Smith   etc... codepre  pI dont think its best practice to have some sort of multilevel for loop in a view correct me if Im wrong, and that I should have some sort of partial view for the member information right now, just FirstName and LastName, but will eventually be more complex and then some sort of main view for the grouping by status that then renders the partial view for each member.

However, I had to remove this attribute from the model because in the edit view for Network, I am displaying a grid of child NetworkDevice records and in the code that builds that grid, an exception is thrown when I attempt to iterate through Model.Network.NetworkDevices.  The exception thrown is strongMore than one item in the metadata collection match the identity NetworkId.strongp  pUPDATE The solution Ive come up with is to leave the NetworkID property in the NetworkDevice class, but decorate it with the [ForeignKey] attribute, which eliminates the exception described above.  Then I reference NetworkID when constructing the redirect URL after the update.p

Negative 3600 pSo Ive been hunting around for a good way to utilize a webcam from within a C application. I tried a pinvoke dll which turned out to be inexplicably and irreproduceably buggy. After tinkering with a few others that either werent suitable or were utterly archaic, I was referred to thisp  pa hrefhttpjakemdrew.wordpress.com20120110controllingyourwebcamerausingccomment15 relnofollowhttpjakemdrew.wordpress.com20120110controllingyourwebcamerausingccomment15ap  pIts the Touchless Vision code with a C wrapper updated to work in VS 2010. It works wonderfully...as long as VS is installed on the machine. Download and run that release build on anything that doesnt and it will throw an error claiming that it cant find WebCamLib.dll or one of its dependencies. The fun part is that Ive already integrated this into the project. It works great, but Id like to be able to distribute this without additional installers or requiring VS 2010 to be installed on everything. What gives herep

Negative 3600 pIn Vim, if you input Latex files vie the codeinputcode command, Vim opens up a split window displaying the included files.p  pThis is a pretty cool feature, but after a while it gets really irritating bc if one opens up a horizontal split that means that there are now 3 or possibly 4 split windows 2 that you desire and 2 more telling you what files are included for those 2 files. p  pyou can close the window manually, but then upon saving the file it reappears again. How can I disable this for include statements onlyp  pstrongEDITstrong I do not want to remove the split entirely. It does sometimes provide useful information. For example, if I type see figure reffoobar it will warn me that I should instead use see figurereffoobar. But that will go away after I fix the problem and save it. With codeinputcode statements, however, the split window never does.p

Negative 3600 pIm just reading Apples developer document of Xcode httpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationToolsLanguagesConceptualXcode4UserGuideInterfaceBuilderInterfaceBuilder.htmlp  pWe know that the difference between the two event handling mechanisms of targetaction and responder chain is whether the target is set or unsetnil. But in the section of To add new action messages to the first responders supported list of that document, the step 5 reads Select the class in which the method will be defined from the popup list in the Type column. Does it mean that the target is will be set, so the action message is sent directly to the type specified in the xcode, instead of going through the responder chain. Within my understanding, that step is not necessary for programming the responder chain. Am I rightp  pThanks.p

Negative 3600 pWe need to simulate MDI windows in a WPF application.p  pThe core functionality that we require is that that it is pinned to its parent, moves when the window moves, minimized with it and such.  We also need to have it be able to be given a WPF control as its parent and clip within its bounds.  Essentially our application is designed to be run full screen, containing with application button bars running along the top and sides along with a status bar that runs along the bottom.  The MDI windows must live within the remaining space and not overlap the button bars or status bar.p  pWe have found a project for DragCanvas that we used and they built our own UserControl that looked like a standard window.  We set the entire usable area, the area not occupied by button bars and the status bar, to be the drag canvas.  Then we added our custom window lookalike as a child of the drag canvas.p  pThis gave us the essentially funcitonality that we require, however, it is extremely slow to move around and even entering data in the textboxes within the window has a huge lag.  We will be deploying the application on laptop, some of which may be upwards of 4 years old.  I am testing on a fairly new i7 machine, and it is slow for me.  Espectially once you add multiple MDI windows to the drag canvas.p  pWhat are other people out there using  Any ideas why our implementation of the DragCanvas control would result in such a slow moving window.  Sometimes the mouse pointer is more than an inch ahead of the window when moving back and forth.p

Negative 3600 pI have a jQuery mobile dialog which works perfectly the first time its loaded, but once the codedialog.closecode button or back button in the browser is clicked and the dialog is initiated again, the dialog is not wrapped in jQuery UI tags and no styling is applied to it.p  pIt works the first time but never again after that. I am assuming it may because the old data may be present in the DOM, but when inspecting the page with firebug I cant find the old data present. I have noticed that after the first initiation, it uses the same jQuery ID on every instance of codeelement.datacodep  pHere is an example of the console.logsp  precodeBefore the dialog is ever created Object  jQuery16102984105026891979..., roledialog  After it has been created Object  jQuery16102984105026891979..., roledialog, page..., more...

Negative 3600 pI am aware there are other similar topics but could not find an straight answer for my question.p  pSuppose you have a function such asp  precodefunction aFunction   local aLuaTable     if something then      aLuaTable     end end codepre  pFor the aLuaTable variable inside the if statement, it is still local right. Basically what I am asking is if I define a variable as local for the first time and then I use it again and again any number of times will it remain local for the rest of the programs life, how does this work exactly.p  pAdditionally I read this definition for Lua global variablesp  blockquote   pAny variable not in a defined block is said to be in the global scope.   Anything in the global scope is accessible by all inner scopes.p blockquote  pWhat is it meant by not in a defined block, my understanding is that if I declare a variable anywhere it will always be global is that not correct.p  pSorry if the questions are too simple, but coming from Java and objectivec, lua is very odd to me.p

Negative 3600 pI have a simple broadcast receiver set to receive system intents informing my application of a change in network status.

Negative 3600 pI am currently coding an application that is using an XML document to retrieve data I am using libxml2.2.7.3. I set it to load a local XMLfile in the project in xCode, so along with all the other project files. I found that I wanted to be able to edit this XML file and then have instant updates on the application. I fetch the data from the XML document like thisp  precodeNSArray dagensRetList  [self getAllItemsdagensret fileNamedagensret.xml] codepre  pI thought that the easiest way to come around this would be to download the xmlfile whenever there is a new version of that document available from the webserver that I provide on every application launch  clicking the refresh button it would download the new file from the server  maybe let it check whether they have the same  tag weekNumber, its a Danish coded applicationp  pSo I am thinking on what would be the most convenient way to download the file and should I keep this way of fetching the data or would it be more wise to keep the document on the server and they would then read directly from the server everytime It could however end up using a lot of traffic, but its a product for my school so the userbase would be around 1200, but less as not everyone is using a smartphone p  pHow would you download a file from a webserver and then keep it cachedp

Negative 3600 pIm facing a very peculiar issue with sessions being reset without any apparent reason. This happens randomly, once every few tens or hundreds of requests.p  pMy web application is running on windows 2003, IIS 6.0, .NET 1.1. The application has a webpage which populates a bunch of Session variables during its PageLoad event. The data is stored out of process in ASPNET State Service.p  pAfter the Pageload event exits and the page is displayed, the user clicks on a button, which retrieves the session data and does some work with it. And this Buttonclick is where the issue occurs. On some occasions, the session variable is null, raising a nullRefException.p  pOur traces show that the sessionID during the Buttonclick event is a brand new session, with a different ID than the session of the PageLoad event. Thus, the application fails to retrieve the data that was stored during PageLoad. Our event log shows that the session variables for the problematic requests are indeed populated during the Pageload event, and the response is sent without issue, which normally would persist the data.p  pWe have ruled out session timeouts although a timeout would still result in the same nullRefException, the same session ID from Pageload would be used to retrieve nonexisting data. In this case, the sessionID is different than the original.p  pWe are not messing with the ASPNET cookie in any way, we do not use session.abandon, nor do we inadvertedly remove items from the session.p  pMy question is what serverside factors could cause the cardholders session to be reset like that The Application event log does not contain any useful info.p  pAlso, is there anything clientside e.g. cookie tampering that could force IIS to assign a new session upon subsequent postbacks of the pagep  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 3600 pIm pretty new to Oracle so not entirely sure this is possible, or if perhaps Im going about it the wrong way but here goes ...p  pPart of an old feeder script Im fixing is looping through  20 tables could change anytime to populate relevant staging tables. This part is currently emveryem basicp  precode...  INSERT INTO stagingtbl1      SELECT       FROM sourcetbl1       INSERT INTO stagingtbl2          SELECT           FROM sourcetbl2       ... codepre  pSome of the fields in the source database have different constraints etc which means that every now and then it will throw an exception and the feeder will stop. What Im hoping to do is create a procedure within the existing feeder package to loop through each row in each record before it is inserted and simply wrap it in an exception block. This way it can be logged without causing the feeder to stop. p  pEssentially Im chasing something like thisp  precodeBEGIN procedurexsourcerecord, stagingrecord     Perform validation to ensure records exit     Loop through all record rows   FOR row IN SELECT  FROM sourcerecord LOOP        Wrap in exception block        Insert into staging record        Log exception if it occurs   END LOOP          END codepre  pIve attempted ref cursors however in order to get them to work I would also need to know the rowtype in advance from my limited understanding. Ive also tried execute immediate however I cannot find a way to loop this in an appropriate way. Are there any other ways to tackle thisp  pstrongAdditionalstrongp  pI realise that we really should be fixing the source of the problem rather than going about it like this, unfortunately it is far outside my area of influence.p  pIt is possible to do this without making a separate procedure and just wrap all of the table references in a loop, however Id like to leave this as a last resort.p

It will only toggle open and closed when the toggle itself is pressed, not when an item in the menu is pressed or the user clicks outside the menu both of these should close the dropdown.p  pThe only thing Im doing nonstandard is my use of an iframe and a theme from bootswatch.p  pI havent had an issue like this before so I have a feeling it may be a bug upgraded bootstrap to 2.1.0, and jquery to 1.7.2 today.p  pall the code herep  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8gt         lttitlegttestlttitlegt         lt Le HTML5 shim, for IE68 support of HTML elements gt         lt[if lt IE 9]gt ltscript srchttphtml5shim.googlecode.comsvntrunkhtml5.jsgtltscriptgt lt[endif]gt         lt Le styles gt         ltlink href.cssbootstrap.css relstylesheetgt         ltstylegt             iframe                  border 0px                 height 95                 left 0px                 position absolute                 top 50px                 width 100                      ltstylegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv classnavbar navbarfixedtopgt             ltdiv classnavbarinnergt                 ltdiv classcontainergt                     lta classbrand targetmainframe href.home.htmlgt                        Brand                     ltagt                     ltul classnavgt                         ltli classdropdowngt                             lta href classdropdowntoggle rolebutton datatoggledropdowngt                                 lti classiconpencil iconwhitegtltigt                                 Sample                                 ltb classcaretgtltbgt                             ltagt                             ltul classdropdownmenu rolemenugt                                 ltligt                                     lta targetmainframe href.home.htmlgtOneltagt                                 ltligt                                 ltligt                                     lta targetmainframe href.home.htmlgtTwoltagt                                 ltligt                                 ltligt                                     lta targetmainframe href.home.htmlgtThreeltagt                                 ltligt                                 ltligt                                     lta targetblank hrefgtFour                                         lti classiconsharealtgtltigt                                     ltagt                                 ltligt                                 ltligt                                     lta targetblank hrefgtFive                                         lti classiconsharealtgtltigt                                     ltagt                                 ltligt                             ltulgt                         ltligt                         ltligt                             lta hrefgt                                 lti classiconcertificate iconwhitegtltigtStuffltagtltligt                         ltligt                             lta hrefgt                                 lti classiconglobe iconwhitegtltigtThingsltagtltligt                         ltligt                             lta targetmainframe href.home.htmlgt                                 lti classiconfilm iconwhitegtltigtNothingltagtltligt                     ltulgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcontainergt             ltiframe idframe namemainframe src.home.htmlgtltiframegt             lt container gt         ltdivgt         lt Le javascriptgt         ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.2jquery.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt          ltscript src.jsbootstrap.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             document.readyfunction                   .dropdowntoggle.dropdown                 var frameheight  window.innerHeight  50                 document.getElementByIdframe.style.height  frameheight  px                           window.resizefunction                   var frameheight  window.innerHeight  50                 document.getElementByIdframe.style.height  frameheight  px                      ltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  plive here a hrefhttpwww.joshlevent.comdropdownbug relnofollowhttpwww.joshlevent.comdropdownbugap

Negative 3600 pIn my applications I usually create three tables for access management.

I created a custom AuthenticationProvider and implemented the codeauthenticatecode method like sop  precodeOverride public Authentication authenticateAuthentication authentication throws AuthenticationException      UserProfile profile  userProfileService.findByEmailauthentication.getPrincipal.toString      ifprofile  null         throw new UsernameNotFoundExceptionString.formatInvalid credentials, authentication.getPrincipal           String suppliedPasswordHash  DigestUtils.shaHexauthentication.getCredentials.toString      ifprofile.getPasswordHash.equalssuppliedPasswordHash         throw new BadCredentialsExceptionInvalid credentials           UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken token  new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationTokenprofile, null, profile.getAuthorities      return token  codepre  pThe codeprofile.getAuthoritiescode method creates a list of Rights rights are wrapped in my own implementation of GrantedAuthority.  So, the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken object is created with this list. This is the UserProfile.getGrantedAuthorities method that takes care of thisp  precodepublic Collectionlt extends GrantedAuthoritygt getAuthorities      SetltProduxAuthoritygt authorities  new HashSetltProduxAuthoritygt     for Role role  roles          for Right right  role.getRights              ProduxAuthority produxAuthority  new ProduxAuthorityright.getName             authorities.addproduxAuthority                   return authorities  codepre  pMy question is whether this is a correct approach. I am getting the impression that I should stuff roles into GrantedAuthorities instead of rights, but I would like to use rights to secure methods and urls, because it gives me more fine grained control  over authorization. How would I accomplish this And what is the difference between a ROLE and a PERMISSION in Spring Do permissions map to rights and could I use hasPermission to secure stuff bases on rights instead of roles p

Negative 3600 pThe title pretty much says it all. Im working on an android project currently that sends a HttpHead request and verifies which status code is sent back. There are certain sections of the website I am accessing that require session data and if you dont have an active session it will redirect you status 302 to the login page otherwise it will just go to the requested page 200. So thats my quick and dirty way of telling whether the session cookies I have are valid without downloading a whole page worth of data. Im just wondering whether this will effect things like Google Analytic tracking data for the website or not so as not to produce false page views for them.p  pCheers p

Negative 3600 pI have a multithreaded application, where different components running in different threads needs to send out UDP messages. For now they all share the same Socket instance.p  pThe socket is created as codeSocket socket  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udpcode and codesocket.Sendbyte[] messagecode is called from the threads. Socket.Send is the only method that is called.p  pIs this a bad approach I havent seen any problems yet, but I fear that this is not the way sockets were intended to be used.p
Negative 3600 pLately I implemented the FXAA algorithm into my OpenGL application. I havent understand this algorithm completely by now but I know that it uses contrast data of the final image to selectively apply blurring. As a post processing effect that makes sense. B since I use deferred shading in my application I already have a depth texture of the scene. Using that it might be much easier and more precise to find edges for applying blur there.p  pSo is there a known antialiasing algorithm using the depth texture instead of the final image to find the edges By fakes I mean an antialiasing algorithm based on a pixel basis instead of a vertex basis.p

Negative 3600 pAssume a class has a component of an object with a fixed type. There are two ways to make the component an attribute of the class. One is to use a pointer pointing to ab object of this type, the other is to use directly the object. When using pointer, I dont need to include the header file of the components type declaration but use forward declaration only. And it is more extensible. My question is this how about its performance when accessing and using it Can the modern compilers optimize it to have the same or similar performance as the direct use Whats your strategy to decide itp  pA stupid examplep  precode Use pointer. class A1  ...  class A2  A1 a1 ...  class A3  A2 a2 ...  class A4  A3 a3 ...  class A5  A4 a4 ...

Negative 3600 pI have a AutoCompleteBox which I search by using a ProductCode. The item source for the autocompletebox is a list codeListltProductgtcode where Product has following properties ProductCode,ProductID,ProductBrandCode.p  pIt all works fine except when I try to retrieve SelectedItem property when selected product has the same ProductCode as another product in the list.p  pSo for example, lets say I have 6 productsp  precode ProductID  ProductCode  ProductBrandCode   1              t1                abc  2              t34               zyx  3              test123           abc  4              test123           zxc   5              test123           asd  6              t23               asd   codepre  pIf I select the 5th product ID of 5, the SelectedItem returns the product with ID  3. Same thing happens if I select product with the id4, I always get the first product that matches the ProductCode. Im assuming that this is caused by the fact that my ValueMemberPath is set to ProductCode witch in this case is not unique and the autoCompleteBox somehow picks up the first matching ProductCode. It works perfectly fine if I select a product that doesnt have a duplicate ProductCode in the list.p  pThis is how it looks in xamlp  precode ltmyAutoCompleteBox xNameautoTxtBoxProductCode                  verticalAlignmentTop HorizontalAlignmentLeft                  Height25 Margin116,10,0,0                  Width144 BackgroundFFEDF4AB                   TabIndex2001 IsTabStopTrue                  PopulatingAutoBoxPopulateProductCode                      ValueMemberPathProductCode                  StyleStaticResource autoTextBoxInError                  Validation.ErrorValidationError                  PreviewKeyUpautoTxtBoxProductCodePreviewKeyUp                  IsTextCompletionEnabledFalse MinimumPrefixLength2                  TextBinding PathProductCode,                         UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged,                         ValidatesOnDataErrorstrue,                         NotifyOnValidationErrortrue,                         ModeTwoWay                         SelectedItemBinding PathProductIDgt                         ltmyAutoCompleteBox.ItemTemplategt                             ltDataTemplategt                                 ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                                     ltTextBlock TextBinding ProductBrandCode                                                FontWeightBold                                                ForegroundBlack                                                Width65 FontSize14gt                                     ltTextBlock TextBinding ProductCode                                                   ForegroundBlackgt                                 ltStackPanelgt                             ltDataTemplategt                         ltmyAutoCompleteBox.ItemTemplategt                     ltmyAutoCompleteBoxgt codepre  pAnd in my Code I retrieve the selected item like thisp  precode private void autoTxtBoxProductCodePreviewKeyUpobject sender, KeyEventArgs e       Product prd  ProductautoTxtBoxProductCode.SelectedItem    MessageBox.Showprd.ProductID.ToString    codepre  pIs there any way around this problem Thanks very muchp

Each activity relates to an element of the property i.e. kitchen, bathroom, central heating etc. There will be circa 50 questions when the app is complete. Each activity has three Spinners and two Edit Texts with which the user must input data relating to the age and condition of the relevant element of the property before moving onto the next activity. p  pMy problem is as followsp  pQuestion 1 relates to the kitchen. Once all the relevant data is inputted I use an intent via a next page button to start the next activity which relates to the bathroom. However, if I realise I made an error with my data input on the kitchen activity and go back via an intent from the bathroom activity in the same way I got to the bathroom activity from the kitchen activity the data I previously inputted is no longer there. p  pHow do I retain this data It is essential that my app users can flick backwards and forwards between the survey questions and view the data they have previously inputted. Once all 50 questions have been answered the data will be saved to a database and the next property can then be surveyed.p  pI have trawled the internet and various books for the answer to this but I am encountering conflicting information.

Negative 3600 pI have a a project with a lib inside it. The project has no resource of its own and all the reoources are in the lib  On my build machine Im using ant to build the project.BR Until upgrading to ADT22 build was ok when building both from eclipse and ant.BR After the upgrade the build fails for the cases when I modify the main project manifest in the ant build.xml. If I dont modify the manifest in the ant build.xml then the build is passed well. The problem that I see is that in that case R files are not generated in my main project but only in my lib project. brbEditbbr The problem was because I changed the package name in the manifest during the ant build. br I Have two build.xml files. One for my main project and one for my lib project.br I moved the ant task that modify the package name to the main application build.xml to be the first compile target depends. brp  precodelttarget namecompile dependsbackupFiles,replaceManifestgName,buildsetup, prebuild, codegen, precompilegt   codepre  pbr And this fixed my problem.br I guess something in the way ADT22 handle the ant build was change and this is what cause the problem since with previes ADTI didnt Have problemsp

Negative 3600 pWhen I attempt to add a Python package under development with codedistributecode to a codevirtualenvcode via codepython setup.py developcode, the system Python path codeusrlibpython2.7distpackagescode on my Ubuntu 13.04 system is automatically added to the virtualenvs codeeasyinstall.pthcode file.

Is there some way to prevent codepython setup.py developcode from adding the system Python path to codeeasyinstall.pthcode when a required package already is installed in the virtualenv I want to avoid adding the system Python path to codeeasyinstall.pthcode because it confuses the codedistributecode entry point mechanism of Python packages that are available both in the virtualenv and in the system Python path e.g., ipython. p

Negative 3600 pI am using Jquery colorbox and flask. When the user hits an icon the script submits a url to render the form inside the colorbox.

Negative 3600 pIve got an application with several ColorPickers in them  theyre just used asis, no data providerderived colours or anything  with editable  true. However, the textfield used to displayinput the hex code for the selected colour is greyed out and uneditable. I cant find any help for this, only a plethora of tutorials telling me to set editable as true, which obviously doesnt work.p  pHave also tried binding to data array of colours, but this does nothing except stop the field from being greyed out though no text appears or can be edited inside it.p  pDoes anyone know how I can stop this happening Thanks in advance.p

Negative 3600 pI have a dart web application using polymer. I can successfully run it with Dartium using boot.js. However, my index.html file is actually a Django template in another git repo for the project. Its uses template inheritance, among other things, so its not just a normal HTML file.p  pMy goal is to have a Makefile compile the project on request. Currently, pub deploy will compile all the code, and it will run in nondart browsers. However, my custom polymer elements do not end up being registered. They all show up as blank. Is this kind of setup even possible, that is, to not have an index.html entry point and build custom polymer elements I could create a dummy buid.html to satisfy the entrypoint requirement, but this seems like a suboptimal solution.p  pMy current buid.dart looks likep  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodeimport dartio import packagepolymercomponentbuild.dart import packagepolymerdeploy.dart as deploy  main    buildnew Options.arguments, []     .then gt deploy.main  codepre  pand the outputp  precodepackagepolymercomponentbuild.dart Error line 68 pos 29      ambiguous reference JSON is defined in library dartconvert      and also in dartio           var message  JSON.encode[jsonMessage] codepre

Negative 3600 pId like to be able to set the fill color of a boxplot series, then override that color on certain states hover and select.p  pThe issue is, any time I set the default fillColor, the hover and select states no longer work, and only the default fillColor is used.p  pIf no default fillcolor is set, then the state fillColors also dont work I guess because they rely on the fillColor property already being set to work.p  pHowever, if I set the default fillColor to an invalid setting like fsdfrw4jh432, then it sorta works. That is, the states now work.p  pSee this jsfiddle to see what I mean a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netwiseguy205b3CuF1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netwiseguy205b3CuF1ap  pAs you can see from that jsfiddle, the hover and select states work, though the fill color starts out black because its an invalid color code.

Negative 3600 pI had been using 2010 Macbook Pro for a while and had updated the Mac OSX to the latest version, and I had been suffering the slow speed for a long time. So last night I googled and do some cleanup , such as fix disk permissions, but the Mac was still slow. And someone suggest to reinstall MacOSX. p  pI was thinking it was the new version of Mac OSXs problem, I had the same kind of problems happen on the 1st version IPad either.p  pAfter I reinstalled, the computer became much more faster. But I encountered the following problemsp  ol liJDK 7 DMG does not support OSX 10.6.8, but ONLY OSX 10.7li liGithub official client does not support OSX 10.7li ol  pGooooooogled again and again, to solve the 1st problem, there are mainly to suggestions A. Using PackageMaker to remove the OSX version condition. B. Using a tool Pacifist to open the pkg file inside the DMG file downloaded from official.p  pSince I have PackageMaker installed on Mac OSX, so I choosed A. Open it with PackageMaker, remove the limitation, and build it again, I installed with the new pkg file successfully at LibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachinesjdk1.7.040.jdkContentsHomep  pAnd then set JAVAHOME on .bashprofile.p  pThen I download the glassfish 4.0 multilanguage version, unzipped, and startdomain successfully. and finally the problem killed me for now.p  pAfter glassfish v4 started, I try to login into web console atp  precodehttplocalhost4848 codepre  pthen glassfish server instance dies, the java process of glassfish is still there, but without any response, the web console starting icon keeps rolling all the time.

Since github official does not support OSX 10.6.8, I found an old installer with version 1.0.3. I installed this version, with one ONLY problem for now, I cannot login into github with username and password,no error responses, just no responding, I suffered this once I was on Windows. But I can work with clicking the Clone into Desktop button on github.com.p  pCan someone help me out I am working on JDK7 based projects. p  pWhy everybody is leaving Snow Leopard, and does not support it anymore, but old Mac computers should be die without working software after 23 years, just 23 years. And OS upgrade to nex t level will DOWNGrade the performance. Why this things happen Is it the oracle from godp

Negative 3600 pIm developing a simple Spring web application to manage documents in PDF format, which should be able to perform the usual operations list them, add a new one, delete and update. These operations go to a MS SQL Server db the documents table has a VARBINARYMAX field to store the documents bytes. The problem arrives when updating a previously added file. Adding the file is easy. The simplied form in the JSP is like this onep  precodeltformform methodpost actionAddDoc commandNamedocument enctypemultipartformdatagt             lttable iddocumentTablegt                 lttrgt                     lttdgt                         ltpgtChoose fileltpgt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltpgtltinput typefile namefile pathfile size40 valuedocument.filegtltpgt                         ltpgtltsferrors pathfile classerrorgtltpgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt lttrgt                     lttd colspan2gt                         ltp classsubmitgtltinput idsubmitForm typesubmit namecommit valueGogtltpgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt lttablegt         ltformformgt codepre  pAs you see the form sends a Document object when submitted, which is validated by the controller and inserted into the database. This Document object stores the documents bytes into a MultipartFile before insertion. Now I want to update this Document object, so the JSP page is the same one as for adding, with the difference that the already existing Document has to be loaded from DB prior to show the page. The form is now populated with the Document info, except the input file field, which I dont know why doesnt get populated while you can see that codevaluedocument.filecode. The problem is that the user might not need to update the file itself, only the other associated attributes that appear on the form, but when it is submitted all fields are properly encapsulated within Document object, except for the file which is empty and causes validation to fail. I would like to be able to populate the file input field when the update document JSP page is loaded, so the info can be sent again if the user submits the form without changing this field.p  pIve thought about other solutions, like modifying the validator to accept an empty file field and then getting the info again from DB or session, but this doesnt look neat.p  pWhat do you think would be a good approachp

Negative 3600 pI am working on an application where my database schema does not match up well to my domain model, and modifications to the database schema are not under my control.  Because of this, I end up doing a lot of mapping in my repository calls, and I have many concrete repos to handle the mapping to and from the database using entity framework databasefirst.  What I am looking for is an elegant way to make calls to my repositories based on the domain entity object type.  Thus far, the domain model itself is still very anemic, as we are still in the process of defining business rules.p  pI have seen an example elsewhere cant recall the link where the repository calls were passed through the domain entities via a static property, but I do not know if this will present threading issues or whether it violates any domain model principles, especially if we decide to implement DIIoC down the road.p  pHere is an example of what I have so far.

Negative 3600 pI made part of a game. In the game there is a player and enemies. I decided to add NPC characters to the game which move randomly.  The problem is that they do not draw as expected.  p  pNPCs do not run as smoothly as the rest of the code. When an NPC moves around it leaves big patches of white where it has been. I think its the speed of the update but Im not quite sure. The framerate is roughly 40 fps. I have tried to find a problem in the update function of NPCs but it looks perfectly fine. However, NPCs only stop creating the weird white patches when I exclude the codedef updateselfcode. Im running Window Vista, Python 2.6 and Pygame.

Negative 3600 pI am developing a highperformance multithreaded application on the Linux platform. Ideally it is expected that all similar threads run with the same speed. However, there are some situation which One thread may execute while another is waiting for some other system latency. One example of system latency is timer interrupt handlers LOC which periodically runs on all CPU cores. p  pI am looking for a low overhead way to perform system performance debugging and detect such a situations. More specifically, I need to know WHY the application threads does not run with ideal speed and which system task is responsible for that wait state. p  pI think there are some performance statistics about process scheduling in codeprocPIDschedcode like codenrwakeupscode. However, I am more interested to know codeWHYcode rather than codeHow Manycode.p  pI used to run codeftracecode while my application is running to monitor Linux kernel function activities and detect execution of any unusual tasks or interrupts. That was how I detect timer interrupt handlers put my application threads in wait state. However, this method has very high performance overhead and its hard to interpret the output. p  pIdeally, I can put my application threads to specific CPU cores. Then I need a performance monitoring tool which tells me what other processes has been executed on these CPU cores during the execution of my application. p  pAny idea p  pThanksp

Negative 3600 pMy app is set up like this, I have two view controllers coming off of my RootViewController  a simple main selection page with two buttons. The top button sends me to ViewController 1 where I take a photo and insert data in 6 text fields about the photo. I then hit a save button which saves those entities to my ManagedObjectModel TargetData inside my ManagedObjectContext. The second button on the main page leads to a TableVIewController where I have called an NSFetchedResults sorta thing to update the TableView.p  pIt works pretty well...at least until I run the TableViewController once. I can add as many photos with text data as I want until I show the TableViewController, at which point, upon leaving the page, the TableViewController will only show the objects it loaded the first time I opened the page, not any items added after that. I have done a little searching and have found that after loading the TableVIew for the first time, the fetchResults is only seeing however many entities it saw the first time it loaded. For example, if I started the app, added 5 photos with text, then ran the TableViewController, I would see 5 items correctly displayed. I could go back to the main page and then add another photo with text, but if I went back to the TableVIewController I would only see the 5 photos I added before opening the TableViewController.p  pIn the class for the TableViewController I have set the  and am using all of its normal methods inside my TableViewController.m file.p  pTotally clueless.

Negative 3600 pMongoose doesnt appear to support Mongo DBRefs. Apparently they released DBRef support but it was actually just plain references no ability to reference documents from different collections. Ive finally managed to craft a schema that allows me to hold an array of ObjectID references and populate them, which is great for certain parts of my schema, but it would be extremely convenient if I could use proper DBRefs to create an array that lets me refer to documents from a number of collections.p  pLuckily theres a module that can monkey patch DBRef support into mongoose a hrefhttpsgithub.comgoulash1971mongoosedbref relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgoulash1971mongoosedbrefap  pUnluckily, I cant make any sense of the documents. The best I can tell is that there is no ability to use DBRefs in an array there is a fetch method to dereference, but it takes a single dbref populate doesnt seem to be patched to fill in DBRefs, and I cant tell how Im supposed to emassignem a DBRef given a source document [collection.items.push].p  pFrom the internet, it appears that I can assign an object of the form  id document.id, ref Collection   when logging the result, it appears to have taken as a DBRef data type, but I am unsure if this is correct since I cannot seem to do anything useful with it turn the ref back into a document.p  pWhat I really want is a way to represent an ordered list of items from multiple collections any solution to this is fine by me, but so far DBRefs are the best Ive got.

Negative 3600 pIm using Swig for generating Java code from CC code.p  pI get many classes unhuman readable, kind of  SWIGpfp........, and so long.p  pHowever, I need my final generated classes to respect some naming rules.p  pFor example p  pstrongSWIGpfpstrong should be deleted and replaced by something kind of strongPointerOn...strong.p  pAlso, in the C code there is a suffix  not generated by SWIG  which is strongFFEstrong used for many methods and I need to delete it.p  pI find in the documentation of SWIG that there is this example of renaming and using regex p  precoderenameregex[AZ][az].2s, isenumitem  codepre  pBut I dont know really how to adapt it in my case.p  pMoreover, having the content of my interface .i  this way p  precodemodule FfeFooJava  include foo.h   some typemaps here that use some C classes and C structures having suffix FFE .....  include foo.h codepre  pWhere can I add the renaming instructionsp  pstrongRemark strongp  pI tried this instruction p  precoderenameregexFFE.2s  codepre  pAnd it changed even some strings values.

Ive checked my nginx error and access logs as well as my gunicorn log and it seems that a gunicorn worker times out after 30 seconds, hence the 404.

Negative 3600 pVim is so awesome.

Negative 3600 pI need to perform casefolding on a set of strings, and must ensure beforehand that they will not exceed a given length after this is done to hardcode the needed buffer size. The problem is that a string length in code points may change after casefolding is applied.

Negative 3600 pIm a noob to this forum and a noob to javascript, but I know a fair share of as3.p  pSo swiffy doesnt support input textfields. I thought that a workaround would be to call a javascript function from the swiffy object which I can do using callExternalInterface which would load an HTML input textfield into an iFrame or a div on a higher zindex layer above my swiffy object, positioned exactly so it looks like its all part of the swiffy object, but sadly my javascript knowledge is in its infancy.p  pIve been going at it, doing research, trying different things, for five or six hours now and everything I try doesnt work. Im loading an external HTML file which defines the textfield, and so far I have gotten something to load, but its all weird, and while it now shows up at the right position, it breaks the layout of the site, and shows up in a little box that tells me I need a plugin to do that.p  pThis is what I have right now, and its pathetic and doesnt even work at all.. loademail is the javascript function Im calling from my flash filep  precodefunction loademail document.getElementByIdswiffycontainer.innerHTMLltobject typetypehtml idemail.html ltobjectgt placeDiv console.infoemail0     function placeDivxpos, ypos    var d  document.getElementByIdemail.html   console.infoboo   d.style.position  relative   d.style.left  292px   d.style.top  380px   d.style.zIndex 2000   console.infoboo2  codepre  pPathetic, isnt it.p  pPlease helpp  pANSWERING MY OWN QUESTIONp  pTurns out this is all much simpler than I was making it out to be.p  pMy friend in Pakistan helped me out over Skype, this is how to get input textfields into your swiffy via javascript, from there it should be possible to cobble together some kind of emailerp  pYou dont need to load any external html file, just delete that part.

Negative 3600 pI have a form with a DataGridView.

If I grab the scrollbar with the mouse and drag it as far down as it will go, it stops maybe 97 of the way down the bar, as if Id reached the bottom and there are more rows of data that I haven not yet scrolled to.  I can release the scrollbar and grab it again and drag it down and it will go down further, but not all the way.  On the fourth try with the current data, it reaches the bottom.  p  pI can hold down the downarrow at the bottom of the scrollbar and that works.  I can cursorarrow down or pagedown all the way to the bottom.  When I do any of those things, the scrollhandle jitters down and then up a little like its recalculating or something.p  pI have tried having the form load with the bottom of the data showing by usingp  precodedgvECN.FirstDisplayedScrollingRowIndex  dgvECN.RowCount  1 codepre  pBut that scrolls the view to around the region of data where the grid seems to initially think the bottom is, rather than the actual bottom.p  pI emthinkem this is my first time working with wrapping text inside the grids cells, so I suspect that as a cause.p  pBut Ive been reading and reading and while Ive found plenty of exotic bugs and errors that sound related at first, they all end up not being my issue and I havent found anything that fixes it.p  pFeel free to ask in the comment for specific info about my project, Im not sure what you might need to help diagnose this.

Negative 3600 pIn a custom string class called codeStrcode I have a function codecstrcode that just returns the private member codechar datacode as codeconst char cstr const  return data code. This works when called after I create a new codeStrcode but if I then overwrite the codeStrcode using codecincode, calling codecstrcode on it only sometimes works, but always works if I codecincode a bigger codeStrcode than the original.p  precodeStr bthis is b cout ltlt b.cstr ltlt endl  cin gtgt b cout ltlt b.cstr ltlt endl codepre  pHere the first codeb.cstrcode works but if I attempt to change codeStr bcode to just b on the codecin gtgt bcode line then it outputs b  a bit of garbage. But if I try to change it to bb it usually works, and if I change it to something longer than this is b, it always works.p  pThis is odd because my istream operator which is friended completely deallocates the codeStrcode and ends up allocating a new char array only 1 char larger for each char it reads in just to see if it would work, it doesnt.

Negative 3600 pI have designed the following list. Now I want to keep its exact appearance but put more space inbetween the lielements. Unfortunately with paddingbottom it moves the borderbottom in a way that it does NOT stay exact in the middle between two elements but glues to the bottom, as it is supposed to do, I see that.

Negative 3600 pIm trying to make a simple program that can enable or disable the proxy settings in windows using winreg. There are 2 settings in the registry that Ill need to change to do this.

I can access both keys, and making the change to the dword was no problem. Where I am having a problem is with the second key, I can open and query it, but Im not sure how to change it. Its a string so I thought I could perhaps slice it and just add the bit that I want, but the original value is codex03code and I need to change it to x09 which when entered into python becomes t since I guess it is the escaped horizontal tab.

I know that this gets the files  string[] filePaths  Directory.GetFilescSomeFolder, .txt  but how to refresh the research and to store them in a file or the SQL table  I tried to use the Append but I had problems each time especially that it needs to run as a windows service.p

Negative 3600 pI have a nodejs sample that is showing tweets I am using socket.io and twitter search stream.

Negative 3600 pI have a User model that has a hasmany emails association to an Email model. The users primary email is just a column email for the user. However, I have this association that allows for multiple email addresses for a user.p  pThe problem is that when a new user is created and validatesuniquenessof email is checked, it only checks other users email column instead of possible secondary emails stored in the Email model.p  pI have tried to write a custom validate method in my User model that tries to find a user by the email address given and it works, but then it screws up other things in my code, like being able to add secondary email addresses or assign primary ones. p  pIs there a way to say something like validatesuniquenessof email through Email.all.each do e errors.add email, this is invalid if e.email  emailp  pThis looks really sloppy, but all Im trying to do is validate the uniqueness of the email address of a user upon creation against another models instances email address. p  pP.S. In case you are confused about the e.email, Email is the model and it has a column email that stores the email address.p
Negative 3600 pI am interested in the way Haskell generates type error messages. In particular, I am interested in the way it suggests program expressions the user might want to fix in order for the error to go away. Examples should make this more clear. Consider the first example.p  precodemain  zprint 2 zprint x  putStrLn x codepre  pThe corresponding error message isp  precodeNo instance for Num String   arising from the literal 2 Possible fix add an instance declaration for Num String In the first argument of zprint, namely 2 In the expression zprint 2 In an equation for main main  zprint 2 codepre  pThe way I am interpreting this is that the compiler is telling me that I should fix the parameter being passed code2code, or the whole function call codezprint 2code, or even the whole codemain  zprint 2code, but it does report codeputStrLncode saying I am using it in a wrong way and I should use some other function. Likewise, we have the following examplep  precodemain  zprint 2 idn x  x zprint x  putStrLn idn x codepre  pThe message is the samep  precodeNo instance for Num String   arising from the literal 2 Possible fix add an instance declaration for Num String In the first argument of zprint, namely 2 In the expression zprint 2 In an equation for main main  zprint 2 codepre  pBut, we could also change the second line to codeidn x  show xcode and the program is now well typed. Hence, I can see the pattern in the way Haskell lists those expressions, but I would like to see the actual algorithm if it is written down somewhere, but not the compiler source code. Note that I am not an expert in Haskell, more of an OCaml person. GJC version I am using is 7.4.1.p
Negative 3600 pI tried two different implementations of FFT in C and both are giving me some strange results. To create a minimal test I really came down to single normalized all params  1 cosine wave which I supply to the FFT but instead of getting single peak at 1Hz, I am getting some function resembling cardinal sine SINC. Now thats a little weird as SINC should be result of FFT for some flat box function.  Im out of ideas what could cause this behavior and just to be sure I ran a demo that shows the expected results a hrefhttpmadebyevan.comdft relnofollowherea. p  pIm currently using this a hrefhttpwww.lomont.orgSoftwareMiscFFTLomontFFT.html relnofollowimplementation of FFTa, but same results were with ExoCortex 1.2.

Negative 3600 pI have an Access 2010 database which is using a form codefrmTimeKeepercode to keep track of the users in the database. The form itsself has a width of 0 so it cannot be seen. It is the first form opened when the database opens and closes when access closes. It has 2 events, open and closep  precodePrivate Sub FormClose     DoCmd.SetWarnings False     DoCmd.RunSQL UPDATE tblUserLogs SET timeOut amp Date amp   amp time amp  WHERE id amp UserLogID     DoCmd.SetWarnings True     MsgBox time keeper close End Sub  Private Sub FormOpenCancel As Integer     DoCmd.SetWarnings False     DoCmd.RunSQL INSERT INTO tblUserLogsuser, timeIn VALUES  amp EnvironUsername amp , amp Date amp   amp time amp      DoCmd.SetWarnings True     Dim rst As DAO.Recordset     Set rst  CurrentDb.OpenRecordsetSELECT TOP 1  FROM tblUserLogs WHERE user amp EnvironUsername amp  AND timeOut IS NULL ORDER BY id DESC     UserLogID  rst0      DoCmd.OpenForm frmLogin End Sub codepre  pcodeUserLogIDcode is a global varriablep  pEssentially the form opens When the db opens and writes to codetblUserLogscode the username and the date time. Then when the database is closed the close sub writes to that same record using codeUserLogIDcode to ensure its the right record.

Negative 3600 pIn an NSManagedObjectModel, some objects are related to others with a delete rule such as cascade, which means that when an initial object is deleted, the related objects are also subsequently deleted.p  pObviously in a well designed database this would not be a problem, but I recently spent a while trying to figure out why some objects were becoming deleted and realised I had accidentally set a delete rule to cascade, which shouldnt have been.p  pThis made me wonder is there a way to tell if an object has been deleted by a delete rule, or by somewhere else in the code p  pI wondered also whether this would be possible by setting up the equivalent of a destructor for NSManagedObjects, e.g. to run a section of code when the object is about to be deleted.p

I have come to the conclusion that the DomainEntityLocator is fetching the entity but is not wrapping that in a transaction. So the DomainEntityLocatorfind method will retrieve the entity and the ServiceLayer will modify the value on the entity. The problem I have is that the find method is not wrapped in a transaction and since the entity manager I am retrieving is not managed the entity manager is not flushing the changes. Hence I do not see the updates on the value. p  pstrongOn Topic Question 2strongp  pIs there a common pattern to adding transaction management to the Entity Locator so that it will persist the object after request factory calls the setters. I used to do this with a simple servlet filter but the project I am working on requires java ee for maintaining this kind of functionality. I cant make the DomainEntityLocator a Stateless bean because of the way the ServiceLayer will look it up. Would it be best to extend the RequestFactoryServlet and wrap the doPost in a tranasction This seems like the most logical idea. Any suggestions p  pThanks again Thomasp

However, I need to use this in our Symfony2 project. Symfony2 obviously relies on namespaces a lot.

Negative 3600 pFellow more advanced programmersp  pPlease forgive me if this seems like the tired Python 32bit64bit ODBCOLEDB Windows issue but I tried searching the forums and cant quite find the reason to my issue.p  pBasically, I tried to connect a very simple Python script first via  ODBC using the pypyodbc module, and then second via OLEDB using the adodbapi module, both attempts to an MS Access 2010 .accdb database. However, for OLEDB I consistently get the emProvider not found. It may not be properly installedem error. And for ODBC I consistently receive the emData source name not found and no default driver specifiedem. p  pDigging deeper, something remarkable happened though. In Python, JET.OLEDB.4.0 works for .mdb files but not ACE.OLEDB.12.0 for .accdb files. Yet, the exact reverse happens when I ran an Access VBA ADODB connectionp  pMy environment includesp  ul liPython3.4 32bitli lipywin32219 installed with postinstallli liMicrosoft Office 2010 64bitli liWindows 7li ul  pYes, I downloaded and successfully installed the AccessDatabaseEnginex64.exe. Yes, I pointed ODBC data sources to WinSysWOW64. Yes, I see the Access driver and datasources for mdb and accdb in odbcad32.exe in aforementioned folder. Yes, I see the registry keys in regedit for Access mdb and Access mdb, accdb data sources and Access driver. And yes, I both restarted and shut offon my machine.p  pstrongOLEDBstrong br The following is my connection string that returns the emProvider not found error...emp  precodeimport adodbapi databasename  DdirectorypathDatabaseName.accdb   constr  ProviderMicrosoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0Data Sources   databasename  db  adodbapi.connectconstr codepre  pRemarkably though, the following connection string works perfectly but of course only with .mdb filesp  precodeimport adodbapi databasename  DotherdirectorypathOtherDatabaseName.mdb  constr  ProviderMicrosoft.JET.OLEDB.4.0Data Sources   databasename  db  adodbapi.connectconstr codepre  pbr strongODBCstrong br The following is my connection string that returns the emData source name not found...emp  precodeimport pypyodbc databasename  DdirectorypathDatabaseName.accdb constr  DRIVERMicrosoft Access Driver .mdb, .accdbDBQs   databasename db  pypyodbc.connectconstr codepre  pLike above, the following works ideally but only for .mdb filesp  precodeimport pypyodbc databasename  DotherdirectorypathOtherDatabaseName.mdb constr  DRIVERMicrosoft Access Driver .mdbDBQs   databasename db  pypyodbc.connectconstr codepre  pbr strongAccess VBAstrong br Interestingly, the EXACT reverse happens in an Access VBA module of course with the ActiveX Data Object library reference using the same connections strings both Driver and Provider.p  pCode works perfectly for both .mdb and .accdb filesp  precodeDim constr As String Dim CN As ADODB.Connection Dim RS As ADODB.Recordset  constr  ProviderMicrosoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0Data SourceDdatabasedirectoryDatabaseName.accdbPersist Security InfoFalse   OR constr  DRIVERMicrosoft Access Driver .mdb, .accdbDBQDdatabasedirectoryDatabaseName.accdbPersist Security InfoFalse  Set CN  New ADODB.Connection CN.Open constr codepre  pCode returns error  emProvider not foundem or emSpecified driver could not be loadedemp  precodeDim constr As String Dim CN As ADODB.Connection Dim RS As ADODB.Recordset  constr  ProviderMicrosoft.JET.OLEDB.4.0Data SourceDotherdatabasedirectoryOtherDatabaseName.mdbPersist Security InfoFalse   OR constr  DRIVERMicrosoft Access Driver .mdbDBQDotherdatabasedirectoryOtherDatabaseName.mdbPersist Security InfoFalse  Set CN  New ADODB.Connection CN.Open constr codepre  pbr ACE.OLEDB.12.0 VS ACE.OLEDB.14.0 br Finally, still in Access VBA, only the Provider Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 works which I thought corresponded to MS Access 2007.

Negative 3600 pI have widget that has some styling applied to it. But then if a certain class is applied to the body that styling gets overridden. For example, lets say the body gets a class of code.bluethemecodep  precode.widget  background lime  body.bluetheme .widget  background blue  codepre  pThis override will obviously apply to all widgets. Now lets say theres a type of page called codebody.testcode, where the same rules apply emexcept for one widgetem, that has a class of code.joecode. This code.joecode widget can appear on other pages  but only if it appears on the codebody.bluetheme.testcode page does it ignore the overriding styles. I can achieve by overriding it again like thisp  precode.widget  background lime  body.bluetheme .widget  background blue  body.bluetheme.test .widget.joe  background lime   revert to original styling codepre  pHowever in my case, I have many styles applied to the widget and its child elements, so much so that it would be a huge headache if I need to make a change and have to change the styling in two places.p  pIs there some way, perhaps with clever use of selectors, whereby I can do this without that extra third line in my example For example saying that I want to override any widget in codebody.bluethemecode, except for code.widget.joecode if the body also has a class of code.testcode.p  pI am using LESS CSS, so a technique using that would be fine.p

I occasionally run across something likep  precodeUPDATE foo SET bar  bar  1 WHERE ... codepre  pIs there way to do have DBIxClass execute exactly this kind of query  I dont want to do something likep  precoderowgtupdate bar gt rowgtbar  1  codepre  pbecause theres a race condition there if multiple processes are trying to do the same thing.p  pI could get around that with some kind of locking at the database level, but that seems worse to me than just using the original query.  Basically I just want to know if theres a clean way of using DBIC to do this or if I should just continue to use raw DBI calls here.p

Negative 3600 pemHopefully this question is not off topic, personally I feel like this is a perfectly valid programming question that I have as a programmer looking towards the future.em p  pGuys, Im failing to understand why I want to involve my websites with client side frameworks like Angular, Backbone, Ember, React, this, that or the other. p  pThe fact of the matter is why learn something like Angular when theyre pretty much pulling the rug out from under people and companies whove invested millions into Angular 1.0 in order to make a new framework which they will call angular 2.0 p  pIf I want some basic dom manipulation why learn a framework at all.  For instance, on the home page of my movies site a hrefhttpwww.noobmovies.com relnofollowwww.noobmovies.coma  youll notice some pagination, this is entirely done by grabbing JSON passed back from a Django Server View and using the client to parse the Data.  Say I need to update a movie etc... why not just pass some data via Ajax and send the response back  p  pThe bottom line is much of what AngularJS and the like does, aims to replace mature frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails etc... but why make life harder at the moment to jump on these buzzword projects that dont seem to do anything more than what these entrenched frameworks are more than capable of doing at the present  p  pTo me, Ive played with React, Angular and Backbone.  I dont like having to learn an entire framework to do something I may be better off doing myself.   It seems like all of these client side frameworks are not production ready to begin with, change way to frequently and make things harder than they need to be for many mundane tasks.  p  pTo me it just seems like everybody coming out of school is like, Dude, I have to build something with Angular to like keep up with the in crowd.  I see no reason why Angular projects are any better than Django or Ruby on Rails, in fact for the most part I see many cases of them being worse. p

Negative 3600 pCurrently I am working on a webpage where certain data from a database is being fetched and displayed to the user. This information is about certain project information and the lead partners of those projects. I want to implement a functionality where the user can click on a lead partner link and the link will redirect this user to another page emwhere the database information of all the organisations is onem strongBUTstrong with a strongpredefinedstrong search for only the organisations that are equal to the clicked lead partner link. p  pI found a solution on how to do this but the problem is that the solution which i describe further below isnt that goodefficient for multiple 128 organisations.. So the question is, do you know a bettermore efficient solution to achieve this. To answer this question you probably also need some background informationp  pstrongBACKGROUND INFORMATIONstrongp  pIn the outputted database information which is done in a table there are several information columnstitles such as p  ul liProject nameli liOrganisations involvedli liLeader partnerli liProject website And so on... li ul  pThe fetching of the data is being done with a simple query where certain database columns have a specific identifier. For example, the project website columns is obviously a link, so in the query it is being done as follows SomeQueryVar  SELECT projectwebsite as LINK FROM xxxx WHERE projectwebsite somewebsite   Just a short example to clarify things. p  pFor the displaying, the data is being catched like sop  precodeifcountSomeQueryVargt0     fori0iltcountSomeQueryVari               echo lttrgt           foreachSomeQueryVar[i] as keygtvalue                            echo lttdgt              bunserializevalue              ifkey LINK ampamp value  NULL                  first  true                  arrayfilterb                  foreachb as y                     echo lta href.y.gt.Project website.ltagt                     first  false                          iffirst break                                                              else                      echo value                          echo lttdgt                                                                         echo lttrgt        codepre  pAs you can see in the above code, certain database columns need other displaying as the rest. For example, links must be clickable instead of just being plain text. These strongexceptionsstrong are being catched with the strongif key strong, for the data that just needs regular displaying plain text there is the last else inserted that just echos the value. p  pstrongMY FOUND SOLUTIONstrongp  pSo regarding the question, i found out that i can create redirection links using the SomePage on the projects page and using this added link value on the organisations page to compare it. If the link is equal, then do the specific query. But it is probably easier to paste the code herep  pstrongThe CATCHING partstrong To catch a specific lead partner is also used an identifier in my query called ORG which stands for organisation. So here is the code where i catch the organisations tablep  precodeifkey ORG ampamp value  NULL      needle  arrayBrainport,Development,BRAINPORT,                     brainport,DEVELOPMENT,development     needle2  arrayCasa,CASA, casa     if strposarrvalue,needle  false                               echo lta hrefhttpportal.eucare.eudatabaseorganisationsabrainport gt.value.ltagt           if strposarrvalue,needle2  false                                  echo lta hrefhttpportal.eucare.eudatabaseorganisationsacasa gt.value.ltagt       codepre  pIn the above code i just created it for 2 organisations brainport and casa. For this solution i used a function called strposarr which searches for the needle in the haystack So in the code above i set the needles to the names in the database where it has to create a link for. So if for example a company with the word Brainport exists in the database, this catcher will see this and display the organisation and make the name clickable. p  pstrongThe strposarr function for the needle is as followsstrongp  precodefunction strposarrvalue, needle      ifisarrayneedle needle  arrayneedle     foreachneedle as what          ifpos  strposvalue, whatfalse return pos          return false  codepre  pIn the redirection page the code will also catch certain links to make queries for that link  so for the brainport link this is a hrefhttpportal.eucare.eudatabaseorganisationsabrainport relnofollowhttpportal.eucare.eudatabaseorganisationsabrainporta  in the second page code this link is catched like sop  precodehost  SERVER[SERVERNAME] .

Despite the fact that everything is compiling just fine, at runtime Im being told the the object doesnt recognize the selectors Im trying to send to it. This means I think that its not actually an instance of the class that Im casting it to. In attempting to test it, I come across this issue with code[NSObject isKindOfClass]code.

Inside this function, you cast data to whatever class you want. Then, you can send messages to the data instance on the main thread. Lets call it a view controllerp  precodevoid libraryCallbackFunctionvoiddata     MyCustomClass myViewController  bridge MyCustomClassdata      stuff stuff stuff      dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,        [myViewController makeInterfaceChange]      codepre  pThis snippet compiles just fine for me, but at runtime Im getting an errorp  pcodeNSInvalidArgumentException, reason [MyCustomClass makeInterfaceChange] unrecognized selector sent to class 0xf3fad8codep  pSo in other words, it appears that codedatacode doesnt actually point to an instance of MyCustomClass. Yes, makeInterfaceChange is defined for MyCustomClass, otherwise it wouldnt compile. As Ive mentioned before, calling codepo [data class]code from lldb when at a breakpoint in this function gives codeMyCustomClasscode.p  pAny ideasp  hr  pWAIT, COULD IT BE The critical bridge cast in this part of the code isnt syntax highlighting, even though strongit is everywhere else in my projectstrong.

From the research I have done, I would be inclined to believe that they were necessary for either overloading the methods with properties from respective parent classes, or overriding. However, as they are calling super which to my understanding would find the parameterless method in the super class which once again does the same thing, I dont see what could actually be getting changed. p  pAs a result of being part of a huge project with massive amounts of subclasses I cant just remove the first method declarations from each class and run to see what happens to identify whether there is a purpose, and I cant seem to find a reference to explain what these initial method declarations which use super are actually doing.p  pAny help or links would be incredibly appreciatedp  hr  pFollow up question p  pWhy cant SSTab just be initialized with parameters with CControl which can be initialized with parameters with Control I dont see how the parameterless constructor variables are necessary to initialize the kinds of objects, when there are constructor variables with parameters which call super anyways. p

For the boxplot are not in the correct x position as expected. this may not be a problem in his example because his boxplot is narrow. But it is extremly harmful when I added outliers. They do not match.p  psorry I have no reputation for posting images and more than 2 links.    i.stack.imgur.com   YTXbY.pngp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre

Negative 3600 pI am using jQuery UI draggable module, and Im having issues with the cursor option.p  pFirst, it does not let you specify multiple cursors, so if you want to use the grabbing cursor which I imagine would be the most common option, you cant specify codewebkitgrabbingcode and codemozgrabbingcode at the same time.p  pSecond, if I cancel the drag by returning codefalsecode from the start handler, it will not revert the body cursor, and I will be stuck with the grabbing cursor forever. I suppose its a bug with jQUI, but Im wondering if there are any workaroundsp

Negative 3600 pIm currently looking for the fastest data structure in C that fulfils my requirementsp  ol liI start with a few million entries which need to be inserted.li liIn each iteration I want to peek at the maximum element and update around 10 other elements.

I thought a heap would be the preferable choice. After looking into the STL I found that most data structures do not support an update which is the crucial part. The solution would be to delete and reinsert the elements which seems to be quite slow bottleneck of my program.

Negative 3600 pI have a RichTextBox that I add preprepared strings to.  Some of those strings contain email addresses and I would like to have those addresses open my default email client when clicked.  Ive tried prepending mailto to those addresses and it does cause the address to be highlighted in the text box, which is good, but clicking it does nothing. Ive seen articles on adding such links directly to a text box but my situation is such that I must preprepare an entire string containing the address as just part of it, then add that entire string at once to the text box.  Is there a way to accomplish thisp  pThanks, Rayp

Negative 3600 pWeve been using Dojo for a long time and at this point our site has become pretty large and complex. Weve gone through the migration to the AMD style, which I kinda like, but Im tasked with finding ways to reduce the script load on each page. One thing I noticed is the i18n, or nls files, that seem to be related to many dojo widgets.p  pWe have most of our code, plus a large part of dojos code, bundled into layer files. However, those layer files do not seem to include all of that layers referenced messages.

Negative 3600 pI am trying to fix a number of issues our companys platform has with an integration with Adobe Connect. One that has me perplexed is intermittent failures with the login method. We have one client whose credentials fail regularly, but not always. I have the login method call in a trycatch block with the CFHTTP output dumped into an email and sent to me. Here is a sample failure, using the cfhttp tag codeltcfhttp urlhttpCall methodGET gtcodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCidIK.jpg altenter image description herep  pHowever, when I invoke the login method via browser, using the URL attribute that is invoked by the CFHTTP tag eg. a hrefhttp[host].adobeconnect.comapixmlactionloginamplogin[username]amppassword[password]ampaccountid[id] relnofollowhttp[host].adobeconnect.comapixmlactionloginamplogin[username]amppassword[password]ampaccountid[id]a, I get the following callbackp  precodeltresultsgt      ltstatus codeokgt ltresultsgt codepre  pThe request header I get back is as follows img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comup4nP.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo, there is nothing wrong with the credentials passed in, nor with the response it does return a MIME type of textxml, when called directly. This points to an issue with the CFHTTP tag, and potentially with the Adobe Connect account weve set up for one of our clients, or both. This does not happen with every call made to Adobe Connect via CFHTTP, and it does seem to happen more often with the account weve set up for one particular client, than for others weve set up. We did get this with other accounts, but when I mitigated it by repeating calls to the API login method upon failure to return a MIME type of textxml, we are now only getting it with this account.p  pWhat can I do with the CFHTTP tag for this API call to get around this problemp

Negative 3600 pSo, Ive been banging my head against the wall for too long on what seems like it should be an easy data conversion. I am writing in python and passing to another module a hex value that is converted with a wrapper to c type uint64t. the problem is I am getting this hex value via the python library argparse. When it takes in this value, for example lets use the value 0x3f, it saves it as a string. If I try to cast this as an int it throws the errorp  precodeValueError invalid literal for int with base 10 0x3f codepre  pIf I create a variable hex  0x3f however, when I print it out, it gives me the appropriate integer value. which is great since Im creating a uint I am just confused how to make the conversion from string to int if a cast doesnt work. I have seen plenty of examples on turning this string into a hex value by letter in other words take each individual character of the ascii string 0x3f and give it a hex value but I havent been able to find an example of the situation I am looking for. Apologies if Im bringing up something that has been answered time and again. p

Negative 3600 pDespite the relative popularity of neighborNets, I couldnt find any solutions to the following problem. In R, Im trying to plot a neighborNet created using package codephangorncode, object class networx. The package uses codeigraphcode for plotting static 2D graphs, so every time I replot the graph, the layout changesrotates default behaviour of codeigraphcode, apparently. Now, if I were to plot an usual igraph, Id just save the layout, and then keep reusing itp  precodefixed  layout.spheresomegraph plotsomegraph, layoutfixed codepre  pBut this doesnt work for the current problem. The help file of plot.networx does refer to igraph and layout, but only in the See also section.

I thought about a Fortran script and converting it from codedouble precisioncode to codefloatcode, but I am not quite sure about the number of digits and this is always a bit tedious with Fortran.p  pSo does anyone know a script that can do this, a sorting program that can read that format or maybe even just a short codesedcode command that might help I am not that good with sed, so it would cost me quite a while to figure out how...p

Negative 3600 pWhile I was watching some dramas, I stumbled upon viki.com. Vikis videos have a comment system inside the video. Here is an example a hrefhttpwww.viki.comvideos1071499vscholarwhowalksthenightepisode1 relnofollowhttpwww.viki.comvideos1071499vscholarwhowalksthenightepisode1ap  pIt appears in the upper left hand corner and users are able to add comments at certain times and it would appear whenever the video plays at that time.p  pWould HTML5 Video Player be able to do this Or would it have to be done in flash I have looked at Video.js. a hrefhttpwww.videojs.com relnofollowhttpwww.videojs.comap  pIm not sure if Video.js allows me to customize HTML5 to the point of adding a comment system. p  pI would like to implement a comment system similar to Vivis in my videos. Can I make an HTML element containing my comment system and place it inside the video tag with the appropriate CSS and Javascript Would that allow me to do thisp  pHow would I go about it Im open to any suggestions. Thank you.p

Negative 3600 pIm getting ready to roll out a PHP application hosted on Google App Engine. It needs to have SSL support and Im trying to decide between SNI and VIP. There may be a chance some Windows XP users access the site, but probably not. My thought was to start out using VIP, check the Analytics to see if there are any Windows XP users, then switch to SNI if possible. p  pCan a switch like this be made If so, do you have any thoughts on the process of doing itp  pThanksp
