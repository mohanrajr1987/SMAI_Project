Positive 21406 pwe are on 7.1 EE and Ive been tasked with designing a SOAPWSDL web service running on Mule that could be consumed by the external clients. The WSDL is given as an input. p  pThe MuleSofts recommended way is to use CXF component for the purpose, generate java classes with wsdl2java and then add the WS logic to the java code.  This of course works but its more a java way of doing the task rather than Mule ESB way.p  pI would prefer an approach where strongMule flow and message transforming components implement the WS logic rather than the java classesstrong. p  pActually, the APIKit is already working this way. Unfortunately, it doesnt support WSDL.  So, what Im looking for is the followingp  ol liGetting the WS input as a POJO in the payload after the schema been validated by CXF. li liUse  DataMapper to transform the POJO to lets say some external VM input parametersli liGet the response from VM into DataMapper, put the values into the WS Response POJO. li liLetting the CXF to complete the task of returning the response to the caller.li ol  pThis would be more Mule way of doing the task, IMHO. p  pNow, looking at the java code generated there are request and response POJOs  already there and could be used in DataMapper. p  pI suspect that there could be actually a way of getting the WS request POJO in the Mule payload, transform it, populate the result POJO and somehow return it back to CXF.p  pAny ideas of how this could be implemented  p  pPls note that I dont think that using CXF proxy mode is a good alternative. Because with this approach you effectively loosing a knowledge about the requestresponse format.  And then youll have to manually define the payload fields for the mapping... Effectively, this would be a manual SOAP parsing.p

Positive 21406 pUsing mule 3.7 with a RESTful application and a design which calls for using dynamic links.  The Jersey documentation and examples call telling the application about the package to use links, and registering the DeclarativeLinkingFeature class on that package, then use InjectLink annotation on the field of the class to receive the link.p  pThis is problematic with Mule, and the Application structure is internal to Mule.  Without this registration, they InjectLink has no effect, jersey does not populate the link.p  pDoes anyone have a solution or work around, or even know if Mule has any provisions for implementing Dynamic Linking.  We have been able to find no information in the Mule documentation nor examples of Mule applications utilizing this feature.  Any hints would be appreciated.p

Positive 21406 pI have a mule cluster with 2 nodes running in different machines, cluster configured through mmc with tomcat. when I deploy application in mmc cluster, applications are deploying 2 nodes.

This causes duplicate of processing records i.e processing same application in 2 machines. Mule cluster is HAActiveActive mode, what I need is at any given time only one node should process and if there is a huge load then other server should process it, even failure of one server should pickup the other server up and running. Instead of doing this, scheduler runs in both application in parallel. How to avoid this.p

Positive 21406 pIm trying to get a project that was made in Mule 3.4 working in Mule 3.7.

Positive 21406 pMule ESB CE supports object stores, which can be set to persistent.

Positive 21406 pI would like to change the log directory from strongMULEHOMElogsstrong to strongMULEHOMElogsappsstrong.  The only place I have found that refers to a file path is in strongMULEHOMEconfwrapper.confstrong.  Editing the strongwrapper.logfilestrong does allow me to relocate the muleee.log file, which seems to be the Mule application log, but Id like to include Mule application logs there, too.  If I create an application called FOO and deploy it to the runtime environment, it will create a file called strongMULEHOMElogsmuleappFOO.logstrong, but changing the location seems to be difficult short of completely messing things up writing custom log4j2 XML files.p
Positive 21406 pI have an xml file in srcmainresources. I also have a folder called input at the root level of the project.

However as the objects in my array are instances of class, they are now like instance methods or conceptually they should be.p  pIs there a magic way to call class methods Or is this just a bad idea and I should just create instances of my policy objects and not use class methodsp
Negative 21406 pI am writing an application to allow users to schedule onetime longrunning tasks from a web application LinuxApacheCGIApplication.

Negative 21406 pIs it possible to get a LINQ to SQL DataContext to run completely inmemory Without it touching the databasep  pI am doing some very rapid prototyping, and want to minimize the surface area for major changes since the UI is changing so fast.

My assumption is that it is not possible, but I thought I would go fishing anyway.p

Negative 21406 pIve stumbled upon a rather strange issue today with Spring 3.0p  pTheres an abstract class codeAcode and its concrete implementation codeAImplcode. codeAImplcode is annotated as codeRepositorycode and is autoscanned by Spring codeltcontextcomponentscangtcode and codeltcontextannotationconfiggtcode are both declared in context. codeAcode and codeAImplcode are deployed in separate JARs not sure if that matters. Everything works just fine.p  pNow, I was reviewing that code and codeRepositorycode didnt seem like a good fit semantically the class in question has nothing to do with persistence so  in my infinite wisdom  Ive decided to change that to more generic codeComponentcode. Needless to say, everything blew up leaving me looking like a complete idiot. The error which occurred during Spring context initialization was Springs codeClassPathResource.getInputStreamcode method complaining about codeAcode class not being there it is, Ive manually checked plus regular class loader finds it just finep  pstrongNothing else has changedstrong. If I swap codeComponentcode for codeRepositorycode context initializes, if I swap them back it doesnt with the above error. a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.0.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlbeans.htmlbeansstereotypeannotationsSpring documentation claims theres no differencea between codeComponentcode and codeRepositorycode which is clearly a damned lie  So I wonder  what strongisstrong the differencep

Negative 21406 pI am continuing the development of a serialization layer generator. The user enters a description of types currently in XSD or in WSDL, and the software produces code in a certain target language currently, Java and ansi C89 which is able to represent the types described and which is also able to serialize turn into a bytesequence and deserialize these values. p  pSince generating code is tricky I mean, writing code is hard. Writing code that writes code is writing code to do a hard thing, which is a whole new land of hardness  . Thus, in the project which preceded my master thesis, we decided that we want some system tests in place. p  pThese system tests know a type and a number of pairs of values and byte sequences. In order to execute a system test in a certain language, the type is run through the syste, resulting in code as described above. This code is then linked with some handwritten hostcode, which is capable of reading these pairs of a byte sequence and a value and functions to read values of the given value from a string. The resulting executable is then run and the bytevaluepairs are fed into this executable and it is overall checked if all such bindings result in the output Y. If this is the case, then these example values for the type serialize into the previously defined byte sequence and we can conclude that the generated code compiles and runs correctly, and thus, overall, that the part of the system handling this type is correct.  This is a very good thing. p  pHowever, right now I am a bit unhappy with the current implementation. Currently, I have written a custom junit runner which uses quite a lot of reflection sorcery in order to read these bytevaluebindings from a classes attributes. Also, the overall stack to generate the code requires a lot of boilerplate code and boilerplate classes which do little more than to contain two or three strings. Even worse, it is quite hard to get a good integration with all tools which base on Junits descriptions and which generate test failure reports. It is quite hard to actually debug what is happening if the helpful maven Junit testrunner or the eclipse test runner gobble up whatever errors the compiler threw, just because the format of this error is different from junits own assertion errors. p  pEven worse, a single failed test in the generated code causes the maven build to fail. This is very annoying. I like it if the maven build fails if a certain test of a different unit fails, because for example, if a certain depth first preorder calculation fails for some reason, everything will go haywire. However, if I just want to show someone some generated code for a type I know working, then it is very annoying if I cannot quickly build my application because the type I am working on right now is not finished. p  pSo, given this background, how can I get a nice automated system which checks these generation specifications Possibilities I have considererdp  ul liA Junit integrated solution appears to be less than ideal, unless I can improve the integration of maven and junit and junit with my runner and everything else.li liWe used fitnesse earlier, but overall ditched it, because it caused more problems than it solved. The major issues we had were integration into maven and hudson.li liA solution using texttest. I am not entirely convinced, because this mostly wants an executable, strings to put on stdin and strings to expect on stdout. Adding the whole run application, link with host code and THEN run the generated executable seems kinda complicated.li liWriting my own solution. This will of course work and do what I want. However, this will be the most time consuming task, as usual. li ul  pSo... do you see another possible way to do this while avoiding to write something ownp
Negative 21406 pGood evening,p  pI am in the process of writing a Java Servlet Struts 2, Tomcat, JSP etc which is capable of doing some fairly complex simulations. These can take up to 2 minutes to complete on the and will return a graph of the results. It is trivial to calculate the percentage of the simulation completed because the process works by repeating the same calculations 1000s of times.p  pI would be interested to know if anyone has ever tried to use client side technology to provide any estimate of the percentage complete.

Negative 21406 pThe situation Im in is this  theres a process thats writing to a file, sometimes the file is rather large say 400  500MB.  I need to know when its done writing.  How can I determine this  If I look in the directory Ill see it there but it might not be done being written. Plus this needs to be done remotely  as in on the same internal LAN but not on the same computer and typically the process that wants to know when the file writing is done is running on a Linux box with a the process thats writing the file and the file itself on a windows box.  No samba isnt an option.  xmlrpc communication to a service on that windows box is an option as well as using snmp to check if thats viable.p  pIdeallyp  ul liWorks on either Linux or Windows  meaning the solution is OS independent. li liWorks for any type of file.li ul  pGood enoughp  ul liWorks just on windows but can be done through some library or whatever that can be accessed with Python.li liWorks only for PDF files.li ul  pCurrent best idea is to periodically open the file in question from some process on the windows box and look at the last bytes checking for the PDF end tag and accounting for the eol differences because the file may have been created on Linux or Windows.p

ProgramView has a property ProgramId, as its primary job is to display this data. ProgramWindow is little more than a wrapper window for this user control.p  pProgramViewViewModel also has a property ProgramId. Changes to this property drive out the operation of the view model, which are surfaced out of the view model using other properties, which ProgramView can bind to.p  pI am trying to hide the operation of the view model from the consumer of the ProgramView and ProgramWindow.p  pThis ProgramId should be bound through all of these layers. Changes to ProgramWindow.ProgramId should flow to ProgramView.ProgramId and then to ProgramViewViewModel.ProgramId. I cannot figure out how to properly implement this.p  pMy current approach is to surface ProgramId in all three classes as a DP. Within the Window, I would imagine ProgramView being instantiated thuslyp  precodeltlocalProgramView ProgramIdBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType localProgramWindow, PathProgramId gt codepre  pThis appears to actually work. Within ProgramView, I do obtain changed events for the property, and they do appear to have the correct value. FindAncestor seems to operate properly.p  pHow then should I synchronize the ProgramViewViewModel.ProgramId property I see two ways. One way would be to set a Binding on the ProgramViewViewModel instance itself, to also use FindAncestor, and find the ProgramId on the ProgramViewViewModel This has two downsides. It requires ProgramViewViewModel to surface ProgramId as a dependency property. Id rather like to avoid this, but it might be acceptable. Either way, I cannot accomplish it in XAML.p  precodeltlocalView.DataContextgt     ltlocalProgramViewViewModel         ProgramIdBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType localProgramView, PathProgramId gt ltlocalView.DataContextgt codepre  pThis does not work. It appears that I cannot introduce a binding expression within the instantiation of the instance. FindAncestor reports that it cannot find ProgramView. My theory here is that the instance is outside of the logical tree, and thus cannot traverse to its parent.p  pThe second option, which makes more sense, is to bind the ProgramView.ProgramId property to ProgramId in the DataContext. I cannot accomplish this because I cannot figure out how to specify a binding expression on a property defined in the codebehind.  is required in the XAML, but the type ProgramId exists on is actually . I cannot figure out how to specify this property.p  pIf I manually in codebehind of ProgramView create a Binding instance and call SetBindingProgramIdProperty, binding, the value no longer flows into the View itself. I believe this is because I just replaced the binding on ProgramView.ProgramId, which was previously set by ProgramWindow. One binding perpropertyp  pMy remaining ideas are to provide TWO ProgramId properties in ProgramView. One bound to the DataContext, the other publicly available to be bound by the consumer ProgramWindow, and then write OnValueChanged handlers that synchronize the two. This feels like a hack. The other is to manually watch for changes on ProgramView.ProgramId and ProgramView.DataContext within the codebehind of ProgramView, and propagate the value myself. Neither of these ideas feel ideal.p  pIm looking for other suggestions.p

Negative 21406 pWhat is a secure way to store and retrieve session data in a Web site Before realizing why it would not work, I for a good while believed the following approach wouldp  ol lipStore everything in session variables whose name is a randomly generated stringp  precode This will be the name of the session variable. id  uniqid   mycomplexobject contains sensitive information  I dont want to transmit over the network. SESSION[id]  mycomplexobject codepreli lipSend those randomly generated string to my users.pli lipOn the client side, send requests to my server using those randomly generated strings as codePOSTcode parameters.pli ol  pBut then I realized this is only as secure as PHPs session ID cookie or that of whatever languageframework you happen to be using, which, I guess, is sent through the tubes as plain text. Together, the session ID and the randomly generated codeidcode are everything an attacker needs to access codemycomplexobjectcode. And they are both available for free to the attacker.p  pSo, could anybody tell me an approach that actually works Maybe there is a secure way to set cookies.p  hr  pstrongNOTEstrong I did not set the PHP tag because it is only incidental that I am using PHP. If you want to give me an example in whatever happens to be your favorite languageframework, please feel free to do so.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong It seems like my original question was not clear enough.p  pLet us suppose we want to generate a HTML table each of whose rows corresponds to a product and will contain a hyperlink to a More information about this product page. Thus, I would do the followingp  ol lipIn codetable.phpcode, I would generate a table with N rows. For each row, I would generate a session variable containing information about the corresponding product. Somewhere in my HTTP responses body, I would also send the names of said session variables.pli lipWhen the user requests more information about a particular product, he sends a codePOSTcode request to codemoreinfo.phpcode, one of whose parameters is the name of the corresponding session variable.pli ol  pSo, while in my HTTP headers I am only sending the session ID cookie, in my HTTP bodies, I am sending the keys to lots of information. Any attacker who took the time to analyze the structure of my HTTP headers and bodies could completely hijack my users sensitive information.p

The fragment, as Im about to dump it, works perfectlyp  precodevoid lripme   unsigned short mr,  RIP from source image                 unsigned short mg,                 unsigned short mb,                 unsigned short lr,  into RGB layer                 unsigned short lg,                 unsigned short lb,                 struct layer lay,                 long start,long finish  long xw,yw long xf,yf long x,y unsigned long offset      xw  laygtparentgtx     yw  laygtparentgty     xf  xw  1     yf  yw  1      for ystart yltfinish y              for x0 xltxw x                      offset  y  xw  x             if x0  xxf  y0  yyf  then on edge                              lr[offset]  mr[offset]                 lg[offset]  mg[offset]                 lb[offset]  mb[offset]                          else                              lr[offset]  mr[offset]                 lg[offset]  mg[offset]                 lb[offset]  mb[offset]                             codepre  pAs you can see, the action at the edge of the image and inside the edges is the same Im simply moving the data. And this works  the output of this is an image in the lr,lg, and lb channels.p  pBUT. If, inside the else clause, I change the lines to read...p  precode            lr[offset]  mr[offsetxw]             lg[offset]  mg[offsetxw]             lb[offset]  mb[offsetxw] codepre  p...youd expect the interior of the image to move one scan line, as the data fetches would be coming from a full scan lines distance away but going to an unshifted target location. Instead, the output looks completely random. Like the shorts were loaded on the wrong boundaries, perhaps, or from somewhere else. This does the same thing...p  precode            lr[offset]  mr[offset1]             lg[offset]  mg[offset1]             lb[offset]  mb[offset1] codepre  p...there, Id expect the image to move one pixel horizontally. No. Same result  purest hash.p  pI have tried changing to pointer math instead of arrays mroffset1 and get exactly the same result. Ive compiled it in a library, and inside objc environment. Ive tried using even offset, thinking perhaps the compiler is confused about the size of the data. I get the same results every time. The offset value can be used as is, but ONLY as is. It cant be modified inside the brackets, and furthermore, it cant be modified OUTSIDE the brackets, just being treated as a long.p  pI have NO idea what is going on here. I would surely appreciate it if someone would help me understand what is.p  pA little background this is a RIP remove isolated pixel operation, or at least, it will be, if I can get at the 8 pixels surrounding the one the loop is currently looking at. Thats why the edges are treated differently I dont want to run the 8pixel lookaround on the edges, only inside them where Ill always have all 8 to look atp  precodeooo oxo ooo codepre  pIn this test case, Ive removed all the RIP code, as it adds a lot of complexity and doesnt shed any light on the problem. Its simply hah a situtation where array and pointer offsets dont seem to work sensibly.p

Negative 21406 pI am likely missing something obvious, but humor me...p  pI always like to name the important threads in my apps as it is useful with debugginglogging etc. If you query the main threads name via codeThread.CurrentThread.Namecode at program startup you will get back codenullcode. As such, I always ensure that the first thing that happens is that the main thread and any other relevent threads get assigned a nice meaningful name for future reference. p  pI never really gave it much thought until today, but when looking at the Threads window in Visual Studio before any thread names are assigned etc, a special category Main Thread is assigned as well as a psuedo name that also reads Main Thread but that isnt the actual thread name.p  pFrom a managed perspective, .NET doesnt expose anything meaningful on either codeSystem.Threading.Threadcode or codeSystem.Diagnostics.ProcessThreadcode that identifies an applications main thread at least that I could see.

Negative 21406 pAFAIK on Android, it is recommended to reference Bitmap objects as WeakReferences in order to avoid memory leaks. When no more hard references are kept of a bitmap object, the garbage collector will automatically collect it.p  pNow, if I understand correctly, the method Bitmap.recycle must always be called to free a Bitmap. I think this is because Bitmap objects have special memory management.p  pIs that correctp  pIf this is true, when using WeakReferences, there must be memory leaks because Bitmap.recycle is never called when the WeakReferences are freed. Or, somehow, are WeakReferences sufficient to avoid memory leaksp  pThanksp

Negative 21406 pI am trying to develop an object oriented representation of a finite element model. The finite element model consists of some output filesoutputs of a commercial Finite element program in binary format which keep certain data related to the finite element model for people who are not in the field, these data correspond to nodes of the model coordinates of the nodes, elements of the model, element connectivity for the element representationswhich elements are associated with which nodes and element matrix information. These data could also be represented generally as some vectors of ints and double and some other array structure if you call so. p  pI was thinking of making a general class FeModel and associating the above mentioned files as members of this class and work this way, of course these files would also be objects representing these files. However, the files that keep the information are not a part of the FeModel class that I was thinking on, at least conceptually. Since the idea does not relate to the real world representation, I thought that there should be a better way. Those files are just there to keep the information. p  pI am now thinking on the option of just reading the necessary information from these files in the FeModel class by creating suitable member functions and build what I want this way so that the interface is more or less a minimal one. However, on the other hand dividing this task into different classes representing the above mentioned files and using those as members in the FeModel class does not look also like a bad option to me. What are the decision criteria in these situations I am aware of the fact that a problem could be solved in many different ways but are there some sort of guidelines to follow in similar kinds of cases where one hesitates between some options p  pGreetz, U.p

Negative 21406 pI have the following problem Given a set of N integers divide them into two almost equal partitions in such a way that the sum of the greater partition is minimum. This sounds almost like the classical partition problem with one exception the even numbers can be divided by two and each half can be placed in a separate partition. p  pFor example  N  4 Numbers 20 5 3 1p  pThe result is 15p  pExplanation The first number will be divided by two and each half placed in one of the two partitions  first partition  10, second partition  10.The second number will be added to the first partition  first partition  15. The last two numbers will be added to the second partition  second partition  14p  p the sum of the greater partitionpartition one  15.p  pThe idea that I have is to sort decreasingly the odd numbers and using a greedy algorithm to start adding them always keeping the difference between the sum of the two partitions as optimal as possible. After finishing with the odd numbers all what is left is to take the even ones and see if adding them entirely to one partition is more optimal than dividing them by two and adding each half to one of those two partitions.p  pAlso for the following set of data the algorithm will provide the correct answer N  2 Numbers 16 15p  p will take 15, add it to the first partition, then take 16 see that is not optimal to divide it by two thus it will add it to the second partition.p  p the answer will be 16.  p  pI am interested if you can provide me a set of data for which the algorithm will not provide the optimal answer and I would be also be grateful if you could suggest any improvements.p  pThanks p

Negative 21406 pThis week we stumbled upon a rather odd bug in IE7 surprise, surprise when embedding a EOT font file using the codefontfacecode construct.p  pTo save on bandwidth, we often edit out sets of characters from a font that we know will not be used on a site. In this particular instance, we were using this font for headers that were all composed in title case, but displayed in uppercase using the codetexttransformcode property. Logically, we saved all our font files with only the uppercase characters, as we simply dont use the lowercase.p  pThe site rendered perfectly in every browser including IE6 and IE8 that supported the codefontfacecode construct, with the notable exception of IE7. IE7 only displayed the first character of each word in the proper font  the rest of the characters were displaying in the browsers default font.p  pScratching our heads, we finally figured out that since the headers were actually written as title case and therefore contained lowercase characters, even though the codetexttransformcode property was deployed and characters were appearing in uppercase, IE7 required the lowercase letters to exist in the EOT file to display the uppercase characters. Intuitive, isnt itp  pThe simple fix was the rebuild the EOT file with both upper and lowercase glyphs, even though the lowercase characters are never used.p  ul liProblem online a hrefhttpwww.testdomeinnaam.nlmike relnofollowhttpwww.testdomeinnaam.nlmikeali ul  pstrongHow can I fix this properlystrong i.e. make IE7 render the uppercase characters without having to include lowercase glyphs in the font.p  pThanksp

Negative 21406 pI am trying to implement a 3D rotation routine for an image stack using CCUDA mostly to speed up calculation times.

Negative 21406 pI am making a utility application. On the flipside, I have a UISegmentedControl. Depending on the users selection, a label on the main view will say one of two things. And while this functionality works, for whatever reason, whenever the user goes to the settings flipside of the app, the segmentedcontrol has the same part of the control highlighted. If the user presses part 0, then returns to the app, then goes back to the settings panel, the segmented control will show part 0 selected. If the user presses part 1, then returns to the app, then goes back to the settings panel, the segmented control will again show part 0 selected. I can disable this, by not choosing either as selected, but the problem still remains. When the user makes a selection, then goes to the main view, then returns to the settings pane, again nothing is selected. How can I retain the users selecting, so that when they return to the settings pane, it will have highlighted his or her most recent selectionp

Negative 21406 pCould somebody please explain to me why the JPA supports the codedoublecode type as a field type, but the bean validation constaints in codejavax.validation.constraintscode i.e. a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavaee6docsapijavaxvalidationconstraintsMin.htmlMinaa hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavaee6docsapijavaxvalidationconstraintsMax.htmlMaxa do not support it I know documentation says this is due to rounding errors, but if I choose the field type to be codedoublecode I already admit that I dont care that much about the explicit precision.p  pThe scenario I ran into this dilemma is the following I have an Entity that represents a point on the earths surface. If the precision is within a few centimeters its fine. It looks something like thisp  precodeEntity public class Point              The longitude in radians.

MinMath.Pi  2     MaxMath.Pi  2     double latitude   codepre  pUnfortunately this does not work, because the annotations do not support the double type. But using codeBigDecimalcode instead is not really an option, because I have some extensive computation with multiple points going on that still needs to be reasonably fast. I worked around it by defining a custom constraint check that does work with codedoublecodes, but somehow I think there is something Im missing in the whole story. So, what am I missingp

Negative 21406 pIm having a use case where Im sending data via TCPIP in one direction. Im doing this via multiple codesendcodecalls with very small in relation to the size of an ethernet frame payloads without any flags for the codesendcodecall. To prevent bloating up my small payload packets to the size of a full ethernet frame, I thought it would be nice to use the codeTCPCORKcode socket option. This works, but when actually comparing the situation before and after using codeTCPCORKcode, I noticed that this kind of aggregation was already done. Why is this so As I said, I do not use any flags for codesendcode like codeMSGMOREcode or other socket options, so I would have expected my original solution to be wasteful.p

Negative 21406 pWhat I want is to be able to use Microsoft Sync Framework to sync two SQL 2008 databases that both use the SQL 2008 change tracking feature.

However, that solution requires SqlExpressClientSyncProvider available from MSFs codeplex project site as Client Sync Provider. This same SqlExpressClientSyncProvider is hinted at elsewhere too.

Negative 21406 pI have recently started with XML and had a question regarding XML schemas. As I understand schemas define a sort of contract that all XML files that implement the schema, will follow. p  pTake, for example, this schema a hrefhttpestar8.energystar.govESESABS20SchemasManageMetersResponse.xsd relnofollowhttpestar8.energystar.govESESABS20SchemasManageMetersResponse.xsdap  pThe root contains three children txnsID, espUserID and customer. Ive read up on schemas and I think I am OK, but I am looking after someones code and the code calls p  precoderoot.getAllChildrenByNameOfcustomer  codepre  pinstead of p  precoderoot.getChildByNameOfcustomer  codepre  pwhich makes me think that there might be multiple customer elements, while I think the schema defines that only one may exist per document. Any clarifications Thanks for your time.p

Negative 21406 pThe syntax of CSS is a bit similar to JSON, making me wonder whether I could dynamically load and apply a CSS theme from a CouchDB using AJAX.

How would that work  I see 2 problems p  p1 how to store the CSS as JSON  in one big string field, or as a structured document p  p2 how to apply the CSS dynamically.p  pI have found that using jQuery, I can apply CSS to selected elements, but it doesnt work the same as normal CSS because the rules of precedence dont apply  you simply affect all selected elements each time you call the code.csscode function.  What I really need is a way to load an entire css file  as a document  and apply the whole thing as if it were a normal css file.p  pMaybe a codeshowcode function can transform a structured JSONCSS document into a normal CSS string  with standard CSS syntax  Then i just need to figure out how to apply it at runtime.p  pAppreciate any thoughts, ideas, and relevant links  thanks.p

Negative 21406 pIm trying to figure out how the Repository pattern works and how it can be implemented in a custom MVC pattern.p  pAs far as i understand it, the Repository is a layer which simply returns data from an entity class or saves the entity class to a persistent layer.p  pNow i currently see it like thisp  pA request comes in into my controller to create a user. Just a username and password. My controller will do something like thisp  precodefunction CreateAction        userRepo  new userRepository       user  new userEntity        usergtsetUsernameuser     usergtsetPassword123456      userRepogtcreateuser  codepre  pThen my emuserRepositoryem class looks like thisp  precodeclass userRepository      public function create  User user               thisgtdbgtexec  INSERT INTO ... QUERY TO SAVE THE USER        codepre  pAnd my emuserEntityem class looks like thisp  precodeclass userEntity      private username     private password      public function setUsername  username               thisgtusername  username           public function getUsername                return thisgtusername           public function setPassword  password               thisgtpassword  password           public function getPassword                return thisgtpassword       codepre  pNow the first thing that i think is wrong here is that im using a query inside the repository class. Where do i actually save the userEntity class to the database So in other words, where do i perform the actual SQL queries I guess the proper way would be to call a DAO inside the create method of the repository. But im still trying to figure out how a DAO really looks and how different it is compared to a Model in terms of the Model in a MVC pattern.p  pBut other than that, is this the proper way of implementing the repository patternp

Negative 21406 pIve created an activity that calls a DrawView extends View, I draw on a Canvas something like a binary tree. The canvas size is greater than the screen size, and the onDraw function draws all the canvas, not only the visible part of it. Ive added an horizontal and a vertical scrollView, and obviously onDraw is called again and again to refresh the view.

Negative 21406 pI have an SNMP trap application in Java that aims at listening to an SNMP agent and printing the received SNMP messages on a JTextArea in a JFrame window. p  pPart I below is my source code showing the content of class TrapReceiver. In this class, the listen method is the place that makes the most of the job. The class is intantiated within a JFrame class on which I intend to show the messages on so mentioned JTeaxtArea. I send the reference of the JTextArea object, the SNMP agent URL and the port into the constructor of the class TrapReceiver and then call the run method of TrapReceiver object to start execution in a seperate thread other than the JFrame instance. Part II below shows how I instantiate the class TrapReeceiver within the JFrame instance. p  pWhen I run the application I noticed that the JFrame instance i.e. GUI is freezing and no message is being printed on so mentioned JTeaxtArea within the JFrame instance which instantiates the class TrapReeceiver shown in Part I below. p  pMy question is why the JFrame instance i.e. GUI is freezing although the TRapReceiver itself is executed as a separate thread Also, I wonder what could be the possible solution to this freezing issue. Thanks in advance. p  pP.S. I have verified that TrapReceiver works fine and can print messages to standard output when running as a stand alone application without GUI but it is this GUI that is freezing somehow due to some possible thread synch issue. I tried to run the TrapReceiver without putting onto a thread and even in this case the GUI was still freezing.p  pstrongPART Istrongp  precode package com.[Intenionally removed].snmp   import java.io.IOException  import javax.swing.JTextArea  import org.snmp4j.  import org.snmp4j.mp.MPv1  import org.snmp4j.mp.MPv2c  import org.snmp4j.security.Priv3DES  import org.snmp4j.security.SecurityProtocols  import org.snmp4j.smi.OctetString  import org.snmp4j.smi.TcpAddress  import org.snmp4j.smi.TransportIpAddress  import org.snmp4j.smi.UdpAddress  import org.snmp4j.transport.AbstractTransportMapping  import org.snmp4j.transport.DefaultTcpTransportMapping  import org.snmp4j.transport.DefaultUdpTransportMapping  import org.snmp4j.util.MultiThreadedMessageDispatcher  import org.snmp4j.util.ThreadPool   public class TrapReceiver implements CommandResponder, Runnable      private String targetSnmpAgentURL    private int targetSnmpAgentPort    private JTextArea outConsole     public TrapReceiver           public TrapReceiverJTextArea outConsole         this.outConsole  outConsole          public TrapReceiverJTextArea outConsole, String targetSnmpAgentURL, int  targetSnmpAgentPort         this.targetSnmpAgentURL  targetSnmpAgentURL        this.targetSnmpAgentPort  targetSnmpAgentPort        this.outConsole  outConsole         try             listennew UdpAddresstargetSnmpAgentURL    targetSnmpAgentPort         catch IOException e             e.printStackTrace                   public final synchronized void listenTransportIpAddress address throws IOException            AbstractTransportMapping transport         if address instanceof TcpAddress              transport  new DefaultTcpTransportMappingTcpAddress address          else              transport  new DefaultUdpTransportMappingUdpAddress address                   ThreadPool threadPool  ThreadPool.createDispatcherPool, 10         MessageDispatcher mDispathcher  new MultiThreadedMessageDispatcher             threadPool, new MessageDispatcherImpl           add message processing models         mDispathcher.addMessageProcessingModelnew MPv1        mDispathcher.addMessageProcessingModelnew MPv2c           add all security protocols         SecurityProtocols.getInstance.addDefaultProtocols         SecurityProtocols.getInstance.addPrivacyProtocolnew Priv3DES           Create Target         CommunityTarget target  new CommunityTarget         target.setCommunitynew OctetStringpublic          Snmp snmp  new SnmpmDispathcher, transport         snmp.addCommandResponderthis          transport.listen         System.out.printlnListening on   address          try             this.wait          catch InterruptedException ex             Thread.currentThread.interrupt                              This method will be called whenever a pdu is received on the given port      specified in the listen method          Override     public synchronized void processPduCommandResponderEvent cmdRespEvent          System.out.printlnReceived PDU...         outConsole.appendReceived PDU...n         PDU pdu  cmdRespEvent.getPDU          if pdu  null                      outConsole.appendTrap Type    pdu.getType  n         outConsole.appendAlarm Type   pdu.getVariableBindings.get4  n         outConsole.appendAlarm Message    pdu.getVariableBindings.get9   nn                        Override      public void run          try                         listennew UdpAddresstargetSnmpAgentURL    targetSnmpAgentPort          catch IOException e              outConsole.appendnError occured while listening to SNMP messages n  e.getMessage  nn                  end of class TrapReceiver codepre  pstrongPART IIstrongp  pemstrongIn the following, I run an instance of class TrapReceiver within a thread.emstrongp  precode   private void jButtonStartListeningSNMPActionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                                                                   Thread snmpThread              new Threadnew TrapReceiverjTextAreaSNMPAlarmOutput, jTextFieldSnmpAgentUrl.getText.trim, Integer.parseIntjTextFieldSnmpAgentPort.getText.trim     snmpThread.start      codepre

Negative 21406 pI am trying to create an event calendar which whilst initially quite small could turn out to be quite large. To that end, when trying to future proof it as much as possible, all events that occur in the past will be deleted from the database. However, is it bad practise to alter the start date of recurring events once they have happened to indicate when the next event will start This makes it easier to perform search queries because theoretically no events will start more than say a week in the past, depending on how often the database is updated.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp  pMy current intention is to have a table listing the event details along with a column for whether it is a yearly, monthly, weekly or daily recurrence. When somebody then searches for events between 2 dates, I simply look at each row and check if EVENT START lt SEARCH FINISH ampamp EVENT FINISH  SEARCH START. This then gets all the possible events, and the recurring ones then need to be checked to see if they occur during the time period given. This is where I come a little unstuck, as to how to achieve this specifically. My thoughts are as followsp  pYearly if EVENT START  1 YEAR lt SEARCH FINISH  EVENT FINISH  1 Year  SEARCH START repeat for 2 YEARS etc until EVENT START  NO YEARS  SEARCH FINISH.p  pMonthly As above but  1 month each time.p  pWeekly As above but EVENT START and EVENT FINISH will be plus 7 DAYS BETWEEN RECURRENCE each iteration until EVENT START  7 DAYS REPEATED  SEARCH FINISH.p  pDaily As above but NO OF DAYS DIFFERENCE instead of 7 days for a week. This could be used to specify things like every 14 days fortnight, every 10 days. Even every week could use this method.p  pHowever, when I think about the query that would have to be built to achieve this, I cannot help think that it will be very cumbersome and probably slow. Is there a better way to achieve the results I want I have still not found a way to do things like occurs on the first Monday of a month or the last Friday of a month, or the second Saturday of April each year. Are these latter options even possiblep  p Edit added belowp  pIt might help a bit if I explain a bit more about what I am creating. That way guidance can be given with respect to that.p  pI am creating a website which allows organisations to add events, whether they are a oneoff or recurring daily, weekly, monthly, first Tuesday of a month etc.. The user of the site will then be able to search for events within a chosen distance arbitrary 10, 25, 50, 100miles, all of country on a set date or between 2 given dates which could be from 1 day apart up to a couple of years apart obviously events that far into the future will be minimal or nonexistant depending on the dates used.p  pThe EVENTS table itself currently holds a lot of information about the event, such as location, cost, age group etc. Would it be better to have this in a separate table which is looked up once it has been determined if the event is within the specified search parameters Clearly not all of this information is needed until the detailed page view, maybe just a name,  location, cost and brief description.p  pI appreciate there are many ways to skin a cat but I am unsure how to skin this one. The biggest thing I am struggling with is how to structure my data so that a query will know if the recursion is within the specified date. Also, given that the mathematics to calculate distance between 2 latlongs is relatively complex, I need to be able to build this calculation into my query, otherwise I will be doing the calculation in PHP anyway. Granted, there will be less results to process this way, but it still needs to be done.p  pAny further advice is greatly appreciated.p

To show you exactly whats happening I have prepared a jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netU2pHH11httpjsfiddle.netU2pHH11a for you.p  pThe Carousel is making every second image not visible to the user due to the Carousels changing style attribute, but the user should see every slide.p  pI have looked already into the sourcecode of the Carousel Plugin and Mootools JS Files but sadly couldnt work out the cause of the problem. I thought maybe its some namingproblem of functionsclasses between jQuery and Mootools but couldnt find any problem there.p  pI hope you can help me out here.p  pEdit I figured out it has something to do with the Fx.Slide class of mootoolsmore.js, deleting the class out of the sourcecode solved the problem. But thats still no really solution, any help is still very appreciated.p

A continuation that takes   type T is known as a valuebased continuation. A valuebased   continuation is scheduled for execution when the antecedent task   completes without error and is not canceled. A continuation that takes   type task as its parameter is known as a taskbased continuation. A   taskbased continuation is always scheduled for execution when the   antecedent task finishes, even when the antecedent task is canceled or   throws an exception. You can then call taskget to get the result of   the antecedent task. If the antecedent task was canceled, taskget   throws concurrencytaskcanceled. If the antecedent task threw an   exception, taskget rethrows that exception. A taskbased   continuation is not marked as canceled when its antecedent task is   canceled.p blockquote  pIs this saying that the final continuation for errorhandling should be the type of the final code.thencode continuation, or the type of the original codecreatetaskcode  If its the final as I did above with codevoidcode, will this continuation actually handle all above errors, or only errors for the final code.thencode callp  pIs this the right way to fix their example  Or notp

Negative 21406 pTitaniums tableview has the ios striped background for the window background and white background for the row background by default.p  pThe method to change the window background is to set the tableview background as transparent. But this causes the row background to become transparent as well.p  pI want to use my own window background but keep the row background in its default white. Is there any way to keep the row background in default whitep
Negative 21406 pI realize that the Eclipse graphical layout editor often usually doesnt render things the same way that the physical devices or emulator do. I can usually deal with that. However, I have a situation where I cant figure out why there is such a big difference, and more importantly, I cant figure out how to get what I want for a layout on the target devices.p  pI am attempting to use some custom ImageButton widgets with custom graphics files as buttons. I simply want the buttons to fill the parent layouts they are in. In the designer, they look the way I think they should. But when I run it on a device, the buttons are way to small. Here is what the design looks like, using a device that is set up to emulate the Droid X that I am testing with.p  pa hrefhttppozzy.comconsultingLayoutDesignInEclipse.PNG relnofollowhttppozzy.comconsultingLayoutDesignInEclipse.PNGap  pHere is a screen capture of the screen when running on my Droid Xp  pa hrefhttppozzy.comconsultingScoreEntryDroidXScreenCapture.png relnofollowhttppozzy.comconsultingScoreEntryDroidXScreenCapture.pngap  pI tried to trim the code down, but it still relies on a number of button image files.

Negative 21406 pAfter much effort, Ive finally got matplotlib, and all its dependencies, working harmoniously on Snow Leopard 10.6.8. Id now like to tweak its configuration slightly to allow me to use my 32bit installation of wxPython as its backend. The problem is that numpy required by matplotlib wont import when I use my 32bit installation of Python 2.7.3 python.org version. Googling for an hour or so has led me to believe that numpy can be built and installed as 32bit by specifying CFLAGS and LDFLAGS inconjunction with setup.py.

This is what I tried from within the downloaded numpy folderp  precode CLFLAGSm32 LDFLAGSm32 python setup.py install codepre  pI get a few error messages, but a 64bit compatible version of numpy does arrive in my sitepackages folder.

Here is what 90 of my php files look likep  precodeltphp  includeConnection.php  userid  POST[userid] fooid  POST[fooid] barid POST[barid] service  new Connection  echo servicegtgetDataXuserid, fooid, barid  gt codepre  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pMy question is, from your experience what is the best way to organize PHP scripts when there are lots of unique queries to handle Is having a Connection class that stores each separate query as a separate method and having a unique PHP file for each method a viable solutionp  pIve tried Googling other solutions and hierarchies but havent come across anything yet.p  pThanksp

Negative 21406 pI am migrating my asp.net mvc3 project to windows azure. I have to migrate asp.net membership to windows azure.

Means in my case i am using SQL server express 2008 as an onpremises data store. And i just have to chnage it to SQL azure data center.p  p2 I downloaded ASP.NET Universal provider through Nuget. This will automatically extend the membership support to SQL azure. Means i just have to change the connection string in the web.config file.In that connection string it requires servername and database. For this i have to create an account in the windows azure. Where i can create the database. And from there i can get the ready made connection string which i have to just paste in my web.config file.p  pAnd i want to know the next steps after doing all this.p  pI Just want to know whether i am on the correct direction or not. If is there anything i am missing or i am not on the right path then please guide to the correct direction  Thanksp

Negative 21406 pI have been trying to use the attributedText property of UITextView to add adjustable line height to my custom UITextView. My code works fine in the simulator, but I am unable to make it work on an iPhone5. If I remove the font line the line height works but it the text reverts to a default smaller font. If I add the font, the font works but the paragraph styling is ignored. I have tried the code on a vanilla UITextView in a fresh app with the same behavior, which makes me think this is an iOS6 bug.

Ever I often copy some code by selecting it first, and then I do a search for something to go and paste the code in, but Visual Studio then by default searches in the selected text, which is not what I want.p  pIm interested in a solution that works in at least Visual Studio 2010 and 2012, but 2008 would also be nice.p

Negative 21406 pI am currently trying to wrap my head around Nodes streams. I think I got the idea, but I am not sure. What puzzles me is a hrefhttpsgithub.comdominictarreventstream relnofollowthis quote by Dominic Tarrap  blockquote   pStreams are nodes best and most misunderstood idea, [...]p blockquote  pAs Dominic is definitely a very clever guy and I guess more clever than me I am not sure if I really understood streams correctly, or if I missed the point . Hence I would like to explain how I understood streams and ask you for approval or refusal.p  pMy basic understanding of streams is that streams are an abstract wrapper of transporting data from a source to a target. There are readable and writable streams, and duplex stream which are readable and writeable. The idea is to abstract away the actual source or target, so that you can focus on dealing with streams without the need to know what actual resource you are dealing with. You are just accessing a stream for reading and  or writing.p  pstrongIs my understanding of Node.js streams correctstrong  Basically, this is the same idea as it is with streams in .NET which has been my background for the last 12 years or so.  strongHow do Node.js streams differ from streams in .NETstrongp  pTo give an example It does not matter if I want to read from a file or a network resource, I just abstract the actual source away using a stream and then read from that stream. I could even change the source, but my streamreading code would still work exactly the same way.  Is this correctp

Negative 21406 pFor a sequence of n distinct elements, like for example 0, 1, 2, ..., n1, where n is even, it is possible to identify n permutations of the sequence that are completely dissimilar from each other. If n is odd, then it is possible to identify n1 such permutations. Note, this is just a claim and not yet a fact.p  pBy completely dissimilar which might not be accurate, I mean that there is no adjacent and ordered pair of elements, like 0,1, 2,3 and n3, n2, from a certain permutation that repeats in any of the remaining permutations.p  pFor examplep  pIf n2, then we can identify 0, 1 and 1, 0 as two completely dissimilar permutations.p  pIf n3, then we can identify 0, 1, 2 and 2, 1, 0 as two completely dissimilar permutations.p  pIf n4, then we can identify 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1 and 3, 2, 1, 0 as four completely dissimilar permutations.p  pIf n5, then we can identify 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 as four completely dissimilar permutations.p  pI will like to knowp  p1 Is there a general rule or algorithm to find, given a sequence, any n if n is even or n1 if n is odd completely dissimilar permutations of that sequencep  p2 Is there a formal definition of this problemp

Negative 21406 pHi I am reading real time values from a cell in Excel. The values are from a Siemens S7 plc. I can get the values if they come in slow enough. For example if I choose a cell that holds the minutes it correctly updates when read. However when I look at the cell containing seconds it only updates every 30 seconds. I always get returned 15 or 45. Is there a way I can get the cells contents every secondp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args throws InterruptedException      try          POIFSFileSystem fs  new POIFSFileSystemnew FileInputStreamfilename         HSSFWorkbook hssfworkbook  new HSSFWorkbookfs         HSSFSheet sheet  hssfworkbook.getSheetAt0         HSSFCell currentStateCellnull         HSSFRow currentRow  sheet.getRow34         currentStateCell  currentRow.getCell0      whiletrue             Thread.sleep800         fs  new POIFSFileSystemnew FileInputStreamfilename          hssfworkbook  new HSSFWorkbookfs         sheet  hssfworkbook.getSheetAt0         this row contains the seconds cellcell A,33         currentRow  sheet.getRow33         currentStateCell  currentRow.getCell0         this print out willgive me either 15.0 or 45.0 I want 160         System.out.printlncurrentStateCell.getNumericCellValue        catch IOException ex          Logger.getLoggerReadExcelExample.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex       codepre  pp

Negative 21406 pI am using springdatamongodb dependency in my Spring MVC application. It was working fine till now but I needed to add a Class instance property to one of my domain objects. Since Mongo doesnt support persisting Class instances directly, I added custom converter for this case.

pWhy do I get this issue only for one page and the first time only Its like something is not instantiated and then suddenly its all fine.

Negative 21406 pI am now writing a JNI version of older cc code I wrote earlier in the year, to include in my android application. I wrote a desktop application equivalent of what I am writing in both Java and C, and the difference in performance is prominent, and I want to therefore take advantage of the ndk.p  pI am extremely new to JNI, and the way I understand things, it seems that I have to do some type mapping codejdoublecode to replace codedoublecode, codejintcode to replace codeintcode, and so on. The thing is though, Ive tried running some of my old code unchanged, and it worked I even have some STL libraries included codelistcode and codevectorcode and I faced no problems.

Negative 21406 pIm reading, in a simple way, how do TLBs work and I dont understand somethingp  blockquote   pThe TLB references physical memory addresses in its table. It may   reside between the CPU and the CPU cache, between the CPU cache and   primary storage memory, or between levels of a multilevel cache. The   placement determines whether the cache uses physical or virtual   addressing. If the cache is virtually addressed, requests are sent   directly from the CPU to the cache, and the TLB is accessed only on a   cache miss. If the cache is physically addressed, the CPU does a TLB   lookup on every memory operation and the resulting physical address is   sent to the cache.p blockquote  pSummary When the TLB is between CPU and CPU cache it uses physical addressing and the CPU does a TLB lookup on every memory operation and the resulting physical address is then sent to the cache.p  pMy question since the CPU deals with virtual addresses, how is this query performedp  pI dont understand CPU encounters a virtual address  CPU contacts TLB which is addressed with physical addresses    TLB spits out another physical addressp  pTLBp  precode Physical Address  Another Physical Address  codepre  pThis totally doesnt make sense to mep  pTaken a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTranslationlookasidebufferOverview relnofollowfrom wikipediaap

I have Oracle.DataAccess 2.112.3.0 in my GAC, and I considered updating to release 5 11.2.0.3.20 of the aforementioned Oracle software, but Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio is the only component that appears to have been updated from release 4, and I believe that Oracle Data Provider for .NET 4 is the component that needs updating. In my .NET project, System.Data.Entity and System.Data.OracleClient are both runtime version 4.0.30319.p  pAnyway, I am just wondering if anyone else has encountered this error, and if so, if any solution has been found  aside from the one in the Oracle forum thread that is linked above that proposes using stored procedures as a workaround.

When this SQL was traced, I passed a 4,000character string as the parameter, and of course an exception occurred. The DBA also mentioned something about certain SQL clients  such as SQLPlus  not being able to handle VARCHAR2s over 2,000 characters. I did not entirely follow. Whether using SQLPlus, SQL Developer, or any other tool, Oracle is still going to be querying a 4,000character VARCHAR2 field. Plus, my magic number is 1,999 characters not 2,000 characters. Did the DBA perhaps mean there is a limitation with how many characters can be in a parameter More importantly, when I execute this SQL in SQL Developer and I enter a 4,000character string for the parameter, it works perfectly. So I am still utterly confused about why it is not working via LINQ to Entities.

Negative 21406 pI have six 6 groups of radio buttons in my Excel spreadsheet.  I am copying amp pasting all of the cells around these radio buttons which grabs the radio buttons too, offsetting everything downward by 60 cells.  This places the pasted radio buttons in the same relative position within the copied range of cells as I go down my page.  p  pThe problem is that the radio buttons are not attached to cells, but are instead objects.  So every time I paste, I need to go into each group of radio buttons and modify the referenced output cell.  Note, the referenced range and output cell for each group of radio buttons is also copied every 60 cells downward.  p  pIs there any way to make the referenced range and output cells for these radio buttons change automatically with each paste so that I dont have to go in and manually modify them each time  p

Negative 21406 pIve been hearing more and more about CSS3 transitions lately. As a JQuery developer of a few years, Im totally in love with how solid it is  robust animations that are simple to execute, and wonderful browser support. Its a very rare day that I find a requirement that JQuery cant handle.p  pNow, its my understanding that CSS3 transitions have some bugs, and by nature of being CSS3 limited browser support. Its also lot harder to time oncomplete and trigger events for animations you need to listen to. Some sites even provide a javascript fallback for their transitionsanimations, and it seems pretty inefficient to me to have the same information in two places on a site.p  pFrom my perspective, theres no reason to stop using JQuery in favor of CSS3 transitions at least not yet  yet the practice is becoming more and more common, so there has to be a reason. Why do CSS3 transitions existp

Negative 21406 pIm still relatively new to JavaScript, coming from a more classical i.e. Java, also ActionScript 3.0 background.

Negative 21406 pIm currently trying to wrap my ahead around the codeMVVMPatterncode. In addition Im using codePRISMcode for IoCsupport etc. But there is one thing among others in particular, that Im not comfortable with the way Im doing it, because it seems a bit strange to me, so maybe I didnt get it right.p  pLets say I want to make a codeListViewcode that displays part of a database schema. So on the toplevel I would have one element per database. Within these elements I want to show the tables in that database and within that, the column names of that table.p  pThe way Im doing this now, is to create 3 view models 1 BaseViewModel for the view hosting the codeListViewcode. One for each layer of the codeListViewcode. So Id have f.e. a codeDatabaseViewViewModelcode, a codeDatabaseTableViewViewModelcode and a codeDatabaseTableColumnViewViewModelcode names are not too hot here. p  pSo the BaseViewModel has an codeObservableCollectioncode of codeDatabaseViewViewModelcodes, the codeDatabaseViewViewModelcode has an codeObservableCollectioncode of codeDatabaseTableViewViewModelcodes and so on.p  pSo obviously those view models need some configuration data the codeDatabaseTableViewViewModelcode f.e. needs to know its database. In my opinion an object should be completly initialized after creation, so Id like to pass that data in the constructor. Of course, that makes it impossible to resolve those view models from an IoC container. But I have to resolve it, since they have some dependencies that need to be resolved f.e. an codeIEventAggregatorcode.p  pAs far as Ive read, the or at least one way to handle this, is to use codeFactoriescode to create the view models, but Im not quite happy with that layout. It seems a bit oversized. p  pSo I wanted to ask you, if I have maybe overlooked something.  Is my view model design valid Or how would you design your view models for this kind of hierarchical codeListViewcodep  pstrongEditstrong For clearification The reason Im creating those 3 different view models is, that I think it gets a little messy in fact Im having trouble to come up with an idea of how to implement that at all off the top of my head when you try to expose properties of objects further down the hierarchy f.e. the column names for databinding.p  pOf course I could use dependency properties or implement the codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode in my model classes  and that might in fact be a good way to go for a new project  but lets assume you have a model, that cant be easily modified.p  pstrongEdit2strong Regarding Sheridans comment on the weird view model classes, thats because in the app Im developing, the database schema IS my data. Im not working on the actual data in the database. Im developing a MySQL Management Agent for Microsofts Forefront Identy Manager. That management agent needs to know the schema of the database relationships etc., which currently gets read in from an XML file. So Im building a UI to comfortable create said XML file. If I was working with the actual data in the database, the view models would most certainly look completely different.p

And it will be locked more than 10 seconds for sure as there almost 1000 values to handle. And all this time synchronization block of finilize cannot be entered. So the application crashes. Note that even removing braces of synchronization block has no use. In such a case LunRef method is locked see a hrefhttpsgithub.comLuaDistluajavablobmastersrcjavaorgkeplerprojectluajavaLuaObject.javaL210 relnofollowfinalize methoda.p  pIs it problem in LuaJava API Or there is another way to execute scripts and have no problems with finalizep  pThanks in advance for helpp

Here is a snippetp  precode7fffe137a0007fffe137b000 rp 00031000 0801 4463612                    usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtxcdxtns2tc.so.0.0.0 7fffe137b0007fffe137c000 rwp 00032000 0801 4463612                    usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtxcdxtns2tc.so.0.0.0 7fffe137c0007fffe1381000 rxp 00000000 0801 4462728                    usrlibx8664linuxgnulibdrmnouveau.so.2.0.0 7fffe13810007fffe1580000 p 00005000 0801 4462728                    usrlibx8664linuxgnulibdrmnouveau.so.2.0.0 codepre  pNot entirely sure what these libs are, but Im assuming they are core components of the OS, and Im accessing them via their physical address so that I can integrate properly through the Xfce frontend.p  pSo, is there a list of the file contents somewhere Or does anyone happen to know off the top of their heads exactly what is in the files Or better yet, which file contains the values Im looking for, stored in memoryp  pThe reason I dont like ptrace is that is freezes the UI and workers of the game Im trying to work with. Ive been contemplating workarounds for a considerable time, just have never gotten around to trying to implement anything as yet, and currently Im having to use Linux for my university studies, so why not try do this as well in my down timep

Negative 21406 pIve got a MySQL INNODB table containing about 2,000,000 rows with 10 fields table cars. Itll keep increasing progressively at a current rate of about 500,000 rows a year. Its a busy table getting different type of queries on average 23 times a second 247.p  pThe situation right now is that I need to expand the information to include an INT field countryid. But, this field will for at least 99  of all rows be default 1.p  pstrongMy question is Would there be any specific reasons to do either of the following solutionsstrongp  ol liAdd the INT field to the table and index it cars.countryidli liAdd a relational table carcountries which includes the fields carid and countryidli ol  pI setup these examples in the test environment made a few thousand iterations of querying the tables for data to find this outp  ol liDatabasetable size will due to the index increase with 19  21 MBli liQueries will take on average 16  longer 0.37717 secs vs 0.32431 secs for 1,000 queries eachli ol  pIve previously tried to keep tables filled with appropriate information for all fields and added relational tables where nonmandatory information was needed for a table but now Ive read theres little gain in this as long as theres no need to have arrayed data which MySQL doesnt handle and PostgreSQL does in the table.

My aim is to be able to create a single Entity Framework .edmx file that can be used on both an MS SQL Server database, and an SQLite database.

Negative 21406 pIm using UIWebViews in an iOS 7 app to display content. Unfortunally it happens that users have enabled the system wide restrictions for websites that were introduced with iOS 7. Although I have nothing of the category adult in my webview content the filter seems to dislike what I want to display in some cases.p  pSo I searched for a way to detect if the system wide restrictions for websites are enabled by the user or a settings profile that is installed on the device. Id like to at least tell the user why some elements of the view behave not as expected and give the advice to allow localhost to fully use my app and still have the restrictions enabled.p  pSadly I could not find a way to detect if those restrictions are enabled. I could of course observe the content of every UIWebView and react in case the content is blocked... this just seems a bit of an overhead to do with every webview all the time and I would like to limit that to those users that really have the restrictions enabled.p  pThis page describes how to setup website restrictions and how they appear to the user, there is also an image how a site in Safari then appears. The same I get in my apps webview a hrefhttpwww.ifans.comforumsthreadsinsideios7howtoblockwebsites.399846 relnofollowhttpwww.ifans.comforumsthreadsinsideios7howtoblockwebsites.399846ap  pSo any hint how I could detect enabled website restrictions would be nice.

Negative 21406 pWe have a text box which is in fact an instance of the standard native Windows edit control used to enter text. The control was created using CreateWindowsEx without the ESAUTOHSCROLL flag specified. It implies that word wrapping for entered text is used automatically.p  pOur goal is to fix the controls width and increase the height of the control automatically as the number of text lines is increased to show all them. An example by default, the text box is empty.

Same apply for the CPU. First one to reach 100 wins the game. Now with my code  The game doesnt stop when anyone reaches 100.

Negative 21406 pIm looking to build a webpage based around a changing homepage. Its going to have the user answer questions, with their answers being stored as part of their session dont want to have to have the user log in. Id then like to be able to access their answers to show them different content on the homepage on the basis of their answers.p  pAt the moment this is what Ive got  p  precode urls.py from django.conf.urls import patterns, url  from home import views  urlpatterns  patterns,     urlr, views.IndexView.asview, nameindex,     urlrPltquestionidgtdPltchoiceidgtd, views.DetailView.asview, namedetail codepre  pThe user visits the index  clicks on an answer link and I receive a questionid and a choiceid. At the moment, Im dealing with them like this...p  precode from views.py class DetailViewgeneric.ListView     templatename  homeindex.html     contextobjectname  homepageobject      def getquerysetself         questionid, choiceid  self.request.path.replace, .split[13]         if history not in self.request.session             self.request.session[history]  [questionid  choiceid]             self.request.session.modified  True         else             self.request.session[history].appendquestionid  choiceid             self.request.session.modified  True         productset  random.sampleProduct.objects.all, 4         return productset codepre  pSo basically I just show the user exactly what they were seeing on the homepage with the bonus of me being able to store their answers. However, it feels like a bit of a hack as theyre actually on a completely different page and the URL shows it and looks messy.p  pIve investigated redirects following posts but most of them seem to be centred around forms and user authentication and so have special methods surrounding them.p  pIs there a sensible way of doing this Is there a neat oneliner thatll handle the parameters Im interested in and keep the user on the same page. Sort of tempted to go the way of AJAX but dont want to have to start investigating how nicely that plays with Django sessions, which Im liking using.p  pThanks,p  pMattp

Negative 21406 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am receiving rgb24 images from a webcam and am encoding them to mpeg4 using libavcodec.  I am not able to decode them back to rgb24.  avcodecdecodevideo2 returns that it processed all of the input but the third parameter to avcodecdecodevideo2 always returns 0. p  pstrongWhat worksstrongp  pPrior to calling avcodecencodevideo2, the rgb24 image is converted to yuv420p format via swsscale.  This works properly as I can take the result from swsscale and convert it back to rgb24 successfully.  I can view the results on the screen which is how I now this part works.  p  pstrongDescriptionstrongp  pFor each image returned from avcodecencodevideo2, I am calling another function that will decode it back to it rgb24.  This scenario is setup for testing purposes to ensure I can encodedecode successfully.   Below summarizes what is happening in the codep  precode variable declarations   ...    main processing   while true       rgb24  getRgb24     swsscale ..., amprgb24, ..., framegtdata, ...            swsscale is successful       ret  avcodecencodevideo2 ..., amppkt, frame, ampgotoutput            avcodecencodevideo2 returns success and gotoutput is 1        copy encoded image to another buffer      memcpy hugebuffer, pkt.data, pkt.size      memcpy hugebuffer  pkt.size, 0, FFINPUTBUFFERPADDINGSIZE       avinitpacket ampdecodePacket      decodePacket.data  hugebuffer     decodePacket.size  pkt.size     len  avcodecdecodevideo2 ..., decodeFrame, ampgotoutput, ampdecodePacket        len  pkt.size but gotoutput is ALWAYS 0      codepre  pI wonder if there is something else I need to do before calling the decode function  p  pFor reference, I have provided the actual code below which includes the following four functions videoEncodeInit, videoEncode, videoDecodeInit, videoDecode.  After that, I have posted how the functions are called.p  precode   Copyright c 2001 Fabrice Bellard     Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy   of this software and associated documentation files the Software, to deal   in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights   to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, andor sell   copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is   furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in   all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Negative 21406 pstrongUPDATEstrong This is why I am not using media queries The site is a parallax site which has about 6070 individual images that animate within each div. Originally I coded the site using straight media queries but that ended up not working because the site would load extremely slow on 3G connection. Now what I am doing is I have created 5 screenshots with all of the elements in their final positions and I am setting those as the background images for the divs by default. Then if it is detected that the screen width is above 1100pxassuming faster internet connection it will remove the background images and append all of the individual assets within the divs. let me know if there is a better way to accomplish this.p  pI have a parallax site which is using jQuery to append elements into the slide divs if the browser width is 1100px or greater and another function to empty those divs if the window is resized smaller than 1100px. I am trying to set this up so that the elements will append and empty automatically as the browser is resized. Here is an example of the append functionp  precodefunction appendElements      swap in desktop content     if window.matchMediaminwidth 1100px.matches      jQuerybgcontainer.append         ltdiv idBG classbgimages datastellarratio.5gt             ltimg srcimgbgbg1.pnggt         ltdivgt       appendElements codepre  pAnd here is an example of the empty functionp  precodefunction emptyContainers      if window.matchMediamaxwidth 1099px.matches          jQuerybgcontainer.empty          codepre  pI added the emptyContainers function to a resize eventp  precodejQuerywindow.resizefunction     emptyContainers     codepre  pThis works as it should, if I start out with my browser at a width of 1100 px, it correctly shows the appended assets and then if I resize the browser below 1100 it removes the assets from the containers. The problem is going back the other way. If I try to resize from below 1100 back up to above 1100 the elements are not reappended.p  pI tried adding the appendElements function to the resize event as well, but this caused all of the elements to duplicate so that there were multiple instances of each element on the page.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advancep

Negative 21406 pIm querying an array using codeincode operator and Im also trying to sort results, but I keep getting this errorp  blockquote   ptoo much data for sort with no index.  add an index or specify a   smaller limitp blockquote  pI know that the sort is limited to 32 megabytes or you have to use an index. The problem is that I have a compound index on field that Im querying and on field that Im sorting on. p  pThe collection p  precode     a  [ 1, 5, 7, 10 ],     ...  other fields are not relevant for querying  codepre  pThe query looks like thisp  precodedb.mycol.find a  in  [ 1, 10, 19, 100, 2000 ] .sortb  1 codepre  pThe codeincode query contains approx. 2000 IDs to match. p  pThe index isp  precode     v  1,     key           a  1,         b  1     ,     ns  db.mycol,     name  a1b1,     background  true , codepre  pIf I use codeexplaincode when doing the query without codesortcode I can see that MongoDB is using that index to perform the query, but it obviously cannot use that same index to perform the sort. I also tried to use a codeskipcode and codelimitcode, but if I use a codeskipcode thats too big I get the same error, probably because index is not used for sorting. p  pIf i create an index only on field codebcode MongoDB will happily sort the data for me. But what I really want is to perform a search on indexed array field and sort the data.p  pI looked at the documentation but I couldnt find anything helpful. Did I encounter a bug in MongoDB or Im doing something wrongp

Negative 21406 pI am in the midst of creating the architecture for my new Point and Click game in the Starling framework. It is set to be big in size, so I am trying to make sure to use best Object Oriented practises to ensure I do not A Repeat the same methods. B Keep it sustainable and clean.p  pI was unaware of Interfacing as a way to contract all classes. To keep everything consistent and to ensure that sub classes have the methods to function correctly. Let us look at an example of a player class i have created.p  precodepublic interface IPlayer     function changeDirectionvoid    function walkToPositionvoid    function pickUpItemvoid   class AbstractPlayer extends Sprite implements IPlayer     public function changeDirectionvoid     protected function walkToPositionvoid     protected function pickUpItemvoid     class Player extends AbstractPlayer     override protected function walkToPositionvoid     override protected function pickUpItemvoid   codepre  pI am aware that AS3 Does not support Abstract Classes natively. But I choose to have it in this form as it makes sense to. What I do not understand is why the interfaces only support public methods. Doesnt that defeat the whole purpose of having an interface so you know what methods are needed for a player. Declaring only the public functions of the player class seems like a half job.p  pA verbose explanation of this concept and perhaps a more advanced solution to how this could be structured would be of great benefit.p  pMany Thanks, Shaunp

Negative 21406 pIve been trying to figure out how this works on a lowlevelp  precode[Authorize] public ActionResult Index      return View  codepre  pBasically, the above code snippet seems to intercept calls to  the Index method, perform an authorization check, and throw and exception if not authorized. The exception prevents the code within the Index method from ever being invoked. p  pThis seems very AOPlike, and is not something easily done in C. If I were to implement my own class that extended System.Attribute, I would not have any interface to hook into pre or post invocation of the method my attribute decorates. So how does the MVC Authorize attribute do it, and how could I do it on my ownp  pPostSharp is a library that accomplishes the same thing using IL Weaving. Basically, at compile time, PostSharp scans the assembly for methods decorated with certain attributes, and then rewrites your code to wrap your method calls with other method calls. p  pDoes the MVC framework also perform some kind of IL Weaving at compile time Is it possible for me to perform my own IL Weaving Or are there other techniques for applying the same AOP principles without complex IL Weaving p  pIve tried to find information on IL Weaving but all I find are articles about PostSharp. I would prefer to stay away from PostSharp because of the Licensing hassles, but moreover, I just want to know how the heck they did it for my own growth as a developer. Its quite fascinating. p

A table called codepersoncode and a column inside person called codelikecode. When user clicks a button, the codelikecode will increase by one. I do it likep  precode[SameBackgroundQueue addOperationWithBlock     User user  [User MRfindFirstWithPredicatesomepredicate]     user.like  1     NSManagedObjectContext localContext  [NSManagedObjectContext MRcontextForCurrentThread]     [localContext MRsaveToPersistentStoreWithCompletionBOOL success, NSError error          [SameBackgroundQueue addOperationWithBlock             [self syncWithServer]This can take time     ] ] codepre  pHowever, if the user clicks fast, the like will not be correct, because codeMRfindFirstWithPredicatecode can get dirty record. The problem stems from that codeNSOperationQueuecode can employee different threads, and codeMRfindFirstWithPredicatecode uses the context from the current thread. So potentially, it will try to get user from different codeNSManagedObjectContextcode and hence it will get dirty data.p  pOf course if we use codemainQueuecode, we will not have any problem. However, how can I use background thread and also make sure I dont have dirty record problem. Seems the whole problem can be solved if I run on one particular thread rather than user NSOperationQueue. Should I use GCD insteadp  hr  pIn my previous project, I am using p  pcode[self createManagedObjectContextWithParentself.mainQueueManagedObjectContext andConcurrencyTypeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType]codep  pandp  precode[managedObjectContext saveamperror] if managedObjectContext.parentContext      [managedObjectContext.parentContext performBlock         NSError parentError  nil         [managedObjectContext.parentContext saveampparentError]     ]  codepre  pI know there are WWDC videos talking about NSManagedObjectContext and concurrent context, etc. But if I use that, I can not use MagicRecord. p  pAny suggestion will be highly appreciated.p  hr  pActually I find a more efficient way to do it. Please correct me if I am doing it wrong.p  pI actually create a common strongsingletonstrong context code[NSManagedObjectContext MRcontext]code to be shared for User OperationQueue. So even all threads access the same context, they will not get dirty data.p  pThere will still be glitches, eg, what if two threads are changing the same object of the same context. That is normally a very rare case, but I will see how it goes. I may set max concurrent thread to be one, just to avoid the situation. I am not sure whether it will decrease the performance. Will update the progress tomorrow.p

Negative 21406 pSo I was assigned in class to code this redesigned homepage in a week. It has to me responsive so after I got it all coded which is a miracle in and of itself I started to research how to make it responsive. I know this probably wasnt the best way of doing things, but hey, this is really my first time to code anything so live and learn I suppose. Anyway, Ive gone through my CSS and set all of widths to be percentages to give it fluidity a good place to start I think. I assigned a maxwidth to almost everything because I have a slider set up with 600px images and I dont want them to scale above that. So everything works fine until I get below 1300. You can visit the site a hrefhttpthomashall.idesignclass.com relnofollowherea to see what happens. I do not understand why the two boxes on the right jump down if they are simply told to take up a certain percentage of the parent div. Interestingly enough, at the same point the last footer item also drops down. Is there something I am missing or what can I do to make it scale properlyp  pI know that in actuality I do not want it to scale indefinitely and plan to use media queries to handle it at smaller resolutions, but it is bothering me that it isnt scaling properly at even such a high resolution of 1300. I wasnt planning to do a media query until I got down to 1024. p  pIf you have any other advice or resources for making a site responsive feel free share.

Negative 21406 pIve created an Access database to be shared through the entire department, which Ive split into a front end and a back end. Unfortunately, theres no easy way I can figure out to ensure all users are consistently using the newest version of the front end on their local machine as I add requested updates.p  pTo overcome this, I created an install batch script that creates a shortcut on their desktop. as well as nesting the front end and an update batch script in a custom folder on their PC. The shortcut actually links to the update batch script, which then downloads the newest version of the front end overwriting the existing one, then loads it.p  pIdeally, this would not download it every time and instead only downloads it if the version of the front end on the network is greater than that on the local machine. Unfortunately, I cant seem to figure out how to do this with an accdb file though Ive seen information for executable files. We are using Access 2010 and an Access 2007 filetype. I still have not figured out how to append a version number to the front end, but Im open to including a text file as well simply to store that version number. Any suggestionsp  pBelow is the script I currently have for the update file.p  precodeECHO OFF CLS XCOPY NetworkPathInstall.accdb cReservedDatabase y q XCOPY NetworkPathInstallUpdate.bat cReservedDatabase y q CLS ECHO Starting database...

Negative 21406 pSo I thought I ask a new question which is an extension of my old question. So I was able to get the contents out from the ImageJ window into my JInternal frame which is inside my desktop pane. But the image will not zoom as the frames size is enlarged. I have found a couple of ways mainly using the zoom class in ImageJ but it will not scale to fit the frame. So I was wondering if anyone knows what I am doing wrong. The zoom in is working and so is the zoom out but the set to zoom and scale to zoom dont work and I have no idea why. Thank in advance. p  pHere is part of my codep  precodepublic class CustomGui extends ImageWindow implements InternalFrameListener, ComponentListener, ActionListener      public CustomGuiImagePlus imp, String title, JDesktopPane desktop, final JMenuItem save, JWindow win, JMenuItem fft          superimp          TODO Autogenerated constructor stub         setCall         img  imp         save.setEnabledtrue         fft.setEnabledtrue         this.title  title         this.win  win         this.fft  fft         this.save  save           JPanel panel  new JPanel          ImageCanvas c  new ImageCanvasimp         c.getImage          panel2.addnew JLabelnew ImageIconc.getImage          m  new ImageWindowimg          Image n  new Image         frame  new MyInternalFrametitle, img, save,m         ImageCanvas c  m.getCanvas         ImagePlus im  new ImagePlus         im.setImageimg           ImageRoi roi  ImageRoi         panel.addc           frame.addm.getContentPane         m.centerNextImage        This is where I try to use the zoom class.         img.getCanvas.setScaleToFittrue          ImageCanvas nu  new ImageCanvasimg         nu.setScaleToFittrue       I set arg to scale but it doesnt work, even when I put it in component resized listener.

Negative 21406 pBefore you claim that this is a possible duplicate, hear me out.p  pIm trying to write some code for my company to be able to parse data onto a server, and in order to do so, I need to use scientific notation. p  pIve already figured out how to convert a regular number to scientific notation using codeFormatcode, but my problem is that I need to have Excel display 0.0000e00, not 0.00e00p  pMy code is extremely basicp  precodeSub ConvertScientific     Dim org, conv     If IsNumericRangea2.Value  True Then         org  Rangea2.Value     Else         MsgBox This is not a valid number     End If     conv  Formatorg, 0.0000E00     Rangeb2.Value  conv End Sub codepre  pMost of that is stuff that doesnt even need touching, but the problem Im running into is that, even though Ive defined the format to be code0.0000e00code, it still ends up resulting in code0.00e00code format. p  pThis is extremely essential to my program, mostly because its meant to run automatically without having a defined spreadsheet where the decimal value is set to 4 on some cells. I know that it is possible to have my desired format, but the only way Ive been able to do it is by doing it manually.p  pMany thanks to anyone with advice.p  pEDITp  pI discovered that a possible way of reformatting is using the codeRange.NumberFormatcode property, but it seems silly to have two lines of code, where one should be sufficient. If anyone could explain why my code isnt working as I understand it should, please feel free to let me know for a 1 andor a valid answer.p

Negative 21406 pIve built an SSIS package in SSDT 2012.  The package was running successfully until I made a change to a script task.p  pThe task, written in C, uses an OLEDB connection to open an Excel workbook and load cell values from each worksheet into separate DataTables.  The table data is then stored in SQL Server. p  pI was opening and closing the connection for each sheet.  I then decided to try to make the code more efficient by only opening the .xls file once, looping over the sheets, and only closing it after all sheets had been loaded.p  pI rebuilt the package.  Now, when I run it, SSIS reaches this script task the last in the package and hangs, displaying the yellow arrow indicating that it is validating the taskp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDx15m.png altenter image description herep  pAny break point that I set in the script code is never reached.  Oddly, if I stop running the package, open the script in VSTA, remove all breakpoints in the C code, and then save the task, the package designer still shows a red circle, which I though indicated that the task contains breakpoints.p  pThese seems like bugs in SSISSSDT.  What would cause the relocation of some script code to hang the validation process like thisp

Negative 21406 pI have a serial communications protocol with several commands, all of which are specified in a text file.

Negative 21406 pThe various examples I see about how to find positions of the matches returned by an IndexSearcher either require retrieving the documents content and search a TokenStream or to index the positions and offsets in the term vectors, turn the query into a term and find it in the term vector.

I thought about using lucenesuggest to do some spellchecking beforehand but it occured to me that it boiled down to trying to find fuzzy matches.p

Negative 21406 pI have a listview in which I inflate a layout with multiple textviews and buttons. I understand to get the text from a view that was clicked is codeTextviewview...code. However I am trying to get the text from the specific textview that is located in the layout in which the user clicked. I have tried using OnItemClick but when I use this the item must be focused before the any of the buttons functions work. I resorted to and prefer using onClickListeners in the codegetViewcode method of my custom adapter. So simply put, how do I click a Button and get the text that is in TextView that is located in the appropriate inflated layout list view item, given that since each inflated layout is considered as one list itemp  pHere are pictures to clarify what i am looking for. Both layouts are members of a listview. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIm0bQ.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJYZhc.png altenter image description herep  pI want to click the button with the date on it and get the text from the textview in the middle of the layout. However when I click the button with the date on it, I can only get the text from the textview in the middle of the layout of the last child. If My Party is the first child in the listview and 3303 going away service... is the second child, when I click the date button the code in my custom adapter returns the text from the last loaded text in the view which will be 3303 going away service. What I am trying to do is when I click the date button on My party, get the text My party. Like wise with the second child. p  pHere is the getView in my custom adapter. p  precode Override     public View getViewfinal int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent           viewHolder

Negative 21406 pI am trying to get a set of information that is currently only available as a column of XML data in a SQL server Im using MS SQL Server Studio 2008.  My table of interest has a column with a lengthy XML string 150,000 chars and is about 20,000 rows tall. My goal is to pull down copies of each XML entry into a separate file in order to flatten the data in postprocessing. p  pI cant figure out how to query over the XML sequentially, though.  It seems like it would make sense to write some kind of script to go through the table and query the XML data one row at a time, then save the text as a .xml file on my disk, and then move on to the next row. p  pHave you seen any implementations of this idea querying out one .xml file at a time before to point to Do you have any recommendations for how to implement this, or alternate approaches  p  pThanksp

Negative 21406 pIm creating a service that hosts and runs other smaller services in separate app domains Sort of like a mini IIS.  When each service gets registered on startup, I run the following codep  precodeAppDomainSetup setup  new AppDomainSetup      LoaderOptimization  LoaderOptimization.MultiDomain,     ShadowCopyDirectories  service.FullPath,  Directory service binary lives in     ShadowCopyFiles  Convert.ToStringtrue   AppDomain domain  AppDomain.CreateDomainservice.Name, null, setup ServiceDomain s  domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrapltServiceDomaingt s.RegisterServiceservice, DefaultPort codepre  pThis basically sets up an app domain, enables shadow copy, and calls codeRegisterServicecode in the new app domain.  The codeRegisterServicecode method will create an instance of an object, which will load the shadow copied assembly into memory.p  pFor example, a service might contain the type codeServiceFoocode in the assembly codeFoo.dllcode.  codeFoo.dllcode lives in codeservice.FullPathcode, and thus gets shadow copied over when the app domain is loaded.  From this point on, I can emdelete or modifyem the original codeFoo.dllcode in the codeservice.FullPathcode directory, which is great.p  pHowever, when someone emmodifiesem the original codeFoo.dllcode For example, they copy in a new version over the network, I want to be notified so I can unload the old app domain and create it again with the new version of the assembly.p  pBasically, what Im trying to do here is provide the ability for administrators to deploy new versions of services without disrupting other services running in the same process.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong How can I be notified when codeFoo.dllcode is modified, or perhaps any file in the codeShadowCopyDirectoriescode directory changes  Im sure I could check time stamps in these directories every few seconds, but it seems like there should be a better way.  Whats the best approach for this situationp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pMy current ideas all resolve around codeFileWatchercode.  However, figuring out which files to watch is proving to my difficult.p  pstrongIdea 1strong Monitor codeservice.FullPathcode, which is the directory that contains the file that might be changed.  However, multiple services might live in this directory.  If I monitor the directory, a change to one file might cause false restarts on services that dont actually use that file.p  pstrongIdea 2strong Parse codeservice.TypeNamecode, which is a string containing the fully qualified type name.  .NET provides ways to parse these strings, such as codeType.GetTypestringcode, which would then allow me to get access to the code base.  However, the second I load the assembly into the parent app domain, it becomes locked so I cant change it anymore.  I could attempt to parse codeTypeNamecode by hand, but this syntax is rather complex.  There are whole libraries that attempt to parse this syntax.p  pstrongIdea 3strong Monitor the codeAssemblyLoadcode eventp  precodedomain.AssemblyLoad  sender, args gt      string test  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.FriendlyName     Uri fileUri  new Uriargs.LoadedAssembly.CodeBase     FileInfo fileInfo  new FileInfofileUri.LocalPath  codepre  pThis gets fired when the domain loads an assembly.  I can detect if codefileInfo.Directorycode is the same as codeservice.FullPathcode and set up a watch on that file if so.  One problem.  This delegate gets run within the context of codedomaincode.  I dont have any access to the codeServiceResolvercode or anything within the root domain.p  pstrongIdea 4strong After I call codes.RegisterServicecode, check codedomain.GetAssembliescode and try to find ones that came from codeservice.FullPathcode.

Negative 21406 pIve seen questions where the two characters are the same, but noting that relates to this specific question so here goes.p  pIm running a C console app that reads an input file that is variable length records. Each record is variable length fields. Ive got everything working in terms of parsing out each individual field within each record, not a problem. Except that today I cam across the  character in the input file. Now I know this translates to , so Im ok with it. However, because I the input file sees  as 2 characters, the record length changes in the C app because the app is interpreting those 2 characters as a single . This is causing my record length to change from 154 characters to 153, and then during the parsing, messing up the individual fields.p  pIm ok with the  character getting stored in my DB. But my question is this.p  pPrior to parsing the fields out of the record, how can I go about easily with checking every single character detecting that the  exists and trigger it to change the parsing logic Should I simply do a IndexOf on the character and code it that way I would think that would add a bit of overhead of I had to put that logic on every single field, although it seems like the easiest way. I would think theres a better way to handle it overall but Ive not encountered this before. Most of the posts I have found are more for handling the  character in text as opposed to text being converted properly from  to p  pIdeasp  pthe streamreader open I am using is as followsp  pSystem.IO.StreamReader concatenatedFile  new System.IO.StreamReadercTestingtest.txt,System.Text.Encoding.UTF8p  pThe record length changes from 154 characters on the input to 153 interpreted characters.p

Negative 21406 pI am trying to load HDF5 data from a memory cache memcached or the network, and then query it read only from multiple Python processes, emwithoutem making a separate copy of the whole data set. Intuitively I would like to mmap the image as it would appear on disk into the multiple processes, and then query it from Python.p  pI am finding this difficult to achieve, hence the question. Pointerscorrections appreciated.p  h2Ideas I have explored so farh2  ul listrongpytablesstrong  This looks the most promising, it supports rich interface for querying HDF5 data and it unlike numpy seems to work with the data without making a process local copy of the data. It even supports a method codeFile.getfileimagecode which would seem to get the file image. What I dont see how to construct a new File  FileNode from a memory image rather than a disk file.li listrongh5pystrong  Another way to get at HDF5 data, as with pytables, it seems to require a disk file. The option drivercore looks promising, but I cant see how to provide an existing mmapd region into it, rather than have it allocate its own.li listrongnumpystrong  A lower level approach, if I share my raw data via mmap, then I might be able to construct a numpy ndarray which can access this data. But the relevant constructor codendarray.newbuffer...code says it will copy the data, and numpy views can only seem to be constructed from existing ndarrays, not raw buffers.li listrongctypesstrong  Very lowest level approach could possibly use multiprocessings codeValuecode wrapper to help a little. If I use ctypes directly I can read my mmapd data without issue, but I would lose all the structural information and help from numpypandaspytables to query it.li listrongAllocate disk spacestrong  I could just allocate a file, write out all the data, and then share it via pytables in all my processes. My understanding is this would be memory efficient because pytables doesnt copy until required and obviously the processes would share the OS disk cache of the underlying file image. My objection is it is ugly and brings disk IO into what I would like to be a pure memory system.li ul

Negative 21406 pIts a bit more complicated than that.p  pFor a travel website, I have 3 parent categories Series, Post Type, and Location.p  pEach post is assigned to a child category. For example respectively EU2014, Picture Gallery, and Rome.p  pOn each post, there is a sidebar. My intention is that this sidebar will contain links to the other related posts. A post is related if it isp  p1. In the same Series child category such as EU2014 AND 2. in the same Location child category lets say Rome.p  pReally what Im doing here is making it so that way the client can write any number of posts, and a network of links will appear on all of them in the sidebar.p  pSo, in sum, all posts designated EU2014 AND Rome will be part of a collection.p  pThen I can format the sidebar nicely based on what Post Type a post in question is with appropriate icons or whatnot.p  pMy problem is thisp  pI need pseudo code. Ive started working on it, but Im very concerned that, if I am to iterate through the entire database of posts every time I load a post, simply to write that sidebar, it will be a massive resource drain on the system.p  pHow can Ip  p1. Identify the child categories of the current post and 2. get the names and links of each post whose Series and Location child categories match those of the current post in order to write that information to the sidebar of the current postp  pwithout creating a black hole of fuckery when the site grows to more than just a few total postsp  pThis is going to be written in PHP, so if anyone has any interest in helping me figure out more than just pseudo, Id be thrilled to suss it out with you.p

The SwingWorker is being implemented to update the user as to the current place in the zip file that is being read since the zip contains a lot of files and will take some time to read and write out. I tried placing a system out just after publish call and that gets executed but the System.out.printlnstr in process never fires. Everything works except the process method Even put a sysout directly before the loop in process and that never gets executed. Any idea puzzled...p  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pI posted the entire example and the final solution was to place the call to readZipFile method to read file in its own thread while continuing to update the writer in the SwingWorker which updates the EDT thread that the GUI runs in.

Negative 21406 pI have a specific situation. I have a web app tests written in java selenium webdriver that are organized and executed with testng in parallel. The process looks like thisp  ul liEvery testng test not test method is run in parallel.li liEvery testng test contains one class and the class has more then one test methodli liEvery testng test has the same listener ItestListener that starts the webdriver that is later shared between all tests methods in this particular test. This listener also closes the webdriver at the end of this test.li ul  pI am trying now to run this suite on Selenium Grid. Problem that I am facing is that after finishing the test webdriver instance stays in Selenium Grid active and blocks execution of next test until the timeout kicks in and kills the test. I am guessing that the problem is this handling of webdriver through the test listener and sharing one driver between test methods.p  pI am doing this simply because I want to save some time on opening and closing the webdriver before and after every test method. p  pMy question is Does anyone have an idea if this behavior is possible when using Selenium Grid and if yes, how this should be handled So does anyone have this situation that he is using Grid and he has the test methods that are sharing webdriver and everything is working correctly If so, I would like to hear how did you achieve it. p  pThanks everyone in advance Lukap  pEdit TestListener codep  precodepublic class WebDriverTestListener extends TestListenerAdapter   Override public void onStartITestContext testContext      super.onStarttestContext     DesiredCapabilities capabilities  DesiredCapabilities.firefox     WebDriver driver  null     try          driver  new RemoteWebDrivernew URLhttplocalhost4444wdhub, capabilities      catch MalformedURLException e          e.printStackTrace          testContext.setAttributewebdriver, driver         Override public void onFinishITestContext testContext      super.onFinishtestContext     WebDriver driver  WebDriver testContext.getAttributewebdriver     driver.close  codepre  pp

Negative 21406 pI think I have a pretty generic question, but it is for a specific application.  I would simply like to know how it might be possible to set a custom attribute on a dropdown that equals the dropdowns initial value.  That value will be bound from a KnockOut view model value, but I dont want to have it be bound permanently, so that if it changes, that attributes value does not changep  precodeltselect databindoptions availableSlots, attr  preset SlotPosition , event change, myChangeRoutine  gtltselectgt  codepre  pIn the example above, codepresetcode is my attribute, and I want to set it to codeSlotPositioncode, which is in my viewmodel and is what the dropdown will initially automatically be set to.  codeavailableSlotscode is a MVC serversidecreated SelectListItem that has slots 1 through x number of items that I return into my viewmodel as a ko.observableArray.  It is in the serverside code that I set codeSelectedcode to true where it needs to be set, for the given value, and build the options.p  pThe above example would bind my attribute codepresetcode to my models value codeSlotPositioncode, but I just want it to remember that value until it is changed, instead of permanently binding to it.  The issue I have is that in codemyChangeRoutinecode, the value for codepresetcode has already become what the dropdown was changed to.  I want this to work so that when I change the dropdowns value and codemyChangeRoutinecode runs, I can do something with the old value.p

Negative 21406 pIm wondering what the best way is to read a file using the new Java 8 stream API, filter the input stream by a pattern match, and then pass the result to a function that consumes the groups from the match.  I expect thats not possible, because stream operations are stateless and the groups from the pattern matcher cannot be passed to the next step in the stream processor.p  pSo, lets say I have thisp  blockquote   pstream.filters  pattern.matchers.matchesp blockquote  pIs it possible to add a callout to a function that takes s or, preferably, the groups from the matches  Something likep  blockquote   pstream.filters  pattern.matchers.matches.ifTrues  myfuncsp blockquote  pI basically want to avoid collecting all my matches to an inmemory data structure, because I dont know how big my stream is.  Lets say I have a huge file and I want to construct and serialize an object that encapsulates the pattern matchers groups.  I dont want to hold all the matches in a single data structure and process that imperatively, so what is the best way to operate on the file such that I can process a single line and limit my memory consumption while also allowing for the file to be processed in parallelp  pIs it better to just iterate over the lines and process those oneatatime  Would this be equivalent to the terminal operation of forEach on the stream  In my use case, I probably dont care about the sideeffects of not being able to parallelize on the terminal operation, but I am curious about the general case when forEach would be problematic during parallel processing.p  pThanks.p

From time to time hot fixes are required between releases, so the current practice is to branch from tag and then release from this new branch. p  pThe problem is that there is a gap between actual tag and new branch which is not covered with any tools as a reviewer you have to either rely on developer and believe that he has created branch from the right tag etc. which was common practice so far or you have to manually check where does the branch come from which is just another manual operation and can be skipped due to close deadlines.p  pstrongSo the question is is there any way to use pull requests procedurestrong  I would prefer raising pull request or some similar control and review tool to tags directly but as far as I understand I cant. Also I can create prodbranch for each release and tag from it, but is seems ponderous to me and I would like to avoid such procedure. p  pP.S. Project uses Stash for pullrequests and Crucible for review.p

However, when I try to run multiple liquidsoap scripts for different mount points, I cannot start the telnet server again because it is already running for the first script, therefore not allowing me to queue songs on anything but the first mount point.p  pThe only thing I can think of is to run different telnet servers on different ports for each of the mount points, but that seems sloppy and inefficient.

The content fetched from AJAX is variable in length across the butttons. I want to maintain that ultimately all buttons have the same height and width after the content is loaded. I tried determining the maxheight and width and then using jQuery to set that. But its very cumbersome and jittery because for some cases number of buttons is very high and multiple AJAX calls are required to fetch content for all buttons. Then I have to resize after every batch.  Can someone suggest a neat way to do it, which would not be too obvious for the user and not degrade the userexperience for the webpage. Should I use animations to resize it p

Negative 21406 pThis is my first post, so my apologies if I word any of this incorrectly.  I will be happy to clarify if need be. p  pI have a pageViewController and each viewController it presents contains a scrollView which displays an imageView from an inapp photo gallery very similar to enlarging a photo in the Photos app and then swiping through the collection of images.  Ive implemented zooming in and out through pinch gestures and generally everything is working, however, when I swipe from one image to the next, then back to the original, and then try swiping forward or backwards, the view gets stuck.  To illustrate this a bit better, say you select image 2 in the gallery.  If you swipe to image 3, then swipe back to image 2, swiping towards either image 1 or image 3 shows a sliver of the image youre trying to get to and then snaps back to image 2.  p  pA quick pinch to zoom the image out a bit and have it lock back into the width of the screen allows you to freely zoom forward or backwards again.  Ive tried adding some code in viewDidAppear to zoom the image out quickly and then let it snap back to the bounds of the screen to simulate this gesture, but as expected you can see the adjustment happening each time a new image is put on the screen and Id like the swiping to be smooth.p  pAny ideas as to a way to fix this would be greatly appreciated.  Ive read into Apples documentation regarding both scrollViews and pageViews as well as their associated delegates and datasources but havent been able to find a source of this problem, though I may have simply overlooked something.p  pAs stated above, please let me know if I can offer any clarification to the issue at hand.  Thanks in advance.p
Negative 21406 pI have a table with 10 columns and 24 rows that can store a value or can be  0. They are called msg1, msg2... up to msg10.

Negative 21406 pI use PHP for solving this task. But thats not the point.p  pEvery morning I get four files each of them contains nearly 60008000 records having the following form p  ul liProduct nameli liPackageli liProducerli liPrice with taxli liExpire dateli liRestli liSeriesli ul  pParsing these records I get the table of products. Later clients make orders so I need to keep id of item in the order table. clients would like to see history of purchasesp  pAll is fine. The arising problem is that one day any of suppliers can send completely different price list. I.e. some products will be removed and others will be added. So it would be completely wrong to rely upon they order in the price list. p  pWhat Ive come to is to parse catalog blindly adding all items one time. Every next time when I  get catalog I need to add only new items and remove the old one from DB. though not actually removing but just marking as deleted so that no new purchases would be possible p  pFor deciding whether item is new or not I will retrieve record by record from Excel file and check  Product name, package, producer, series fields in conjunction against the table with products. p  pIf no such item is found I assume that this is a new item and Ill add it to DB. p  pWhat to do with deleted items Im not warned about deletion of them. So I cant find out what items are missing in the new Excel file. The solution is to scan DB item by item and see whether all items in DB are present in Excel file. If some item is missing  then I will mark  it as deleted. p  pOnce deleted items can be back for selling. So I will need to select all deleted items and check one by one against Excel file. If item appears in Excel file  I add it back.p  pIts worth to note that some suppliers give their catalogs as Excel files and others as DBF files as for now.  Who knows what formats will come in the future. Also the number of suppliers is supposed to grow up next month we get 2 more into play.p  pMy question. Is there any better way to do it more efficient Im afraid that my method is too straightforward.p  pHaving 8000 records and doing 3 checks I will get O2 complexity for every price list making whole search through MySQL Db. Perhaps it will work for 8000 records but Im sure its going to fail when one day I get price list with lets say 105 record. p  pIs there a better way to organise itp  pThanks.p

Negative 21406 pI am building a turnbased strategy game using libtcodpython.p  pI am trying to display a map which considers multiple fields of view one for each unit of varying range, and combines them into one. p  pIn other words, suppose there two units, alpha and beta. Alpha has a sight range of 5, Beta of 3. This means, barring any obstructions Alpha sees farther than Beta. p  pLibtcod has builtin functionality for building fov maps. p  pMy question is, supposing that I have 1 large 80x80 map with various terrain information some tiles are transparent, others not so, how I do I take slices of this map proportional to the sight range of the units and then combine them back together for displayp  pThe slices also need to be updated in their tile information as the units move about.p  pIve tried creating a fov map as an attribute of the unit, computing the fov using the builtin algorithm adding visible tiles to set, union all sets and then display those tiles. The problem with this is that it does not take into account the terrain tiles in the large map.p

Negative 21406 pI am relatively new to Hadoop and have been trying to set up a development environment for a project I am involved with CentOS 6.5 is the OS.  I originally set up the environment using Ambari 1.7 and installing the Hortonworks Data Platform version HDP2.2.0.02041.p  pNow, I am trying to upgrade to Ambari 2.0.1 and HDP2.2.6.0.p  pAmbari upgraded with no problems at all.  I also was able to register the new version of HDP through the Ambari Manage Version page.  That all went fine.p  pThe problem is when I try to finish the upgrade.  The instructions say to go from the Admin menu to Stack and Versions then the Versions tab.  There, I am supposed to see my registered versions and a link to complete the upgrade.  However, all I get is a blank page.p  pFYI, I tried multiple browsers to rule out a browser issue.  I tried Firefox and Opera.  Ive heard that Chrome is no longer supported for CentOS so didnt try that.p  pAnyone know why this page would just be blank andor how I can fix itp  pThanks Tomp  pBTW, I tried to post images, but I dont have enough reputation points so I cant.  Youll have to take my word for it that Manage Versions is showing the correct versions but the Versions tab under Stack and Versions is completely blank.p

Negative 21406 pIm facing some issues when Im trying to deal with codeIBindingListcode inherited collections that are modified by a nonUI codeThreadcode and are at the same time bound to the codeDataSourcecode Property of some Winforms Controls e.g. an old fashion codeDataGridViewcode.p  pMy point is that codeInvoke  Begincode are not suitable in my solution, cause the collections are not supposed to be really aware of the controls they are bound to.p  pIs there any other elegant solution than passing the UI codeDispatchercode or the appropriate codeSynchronizationContextcode reference to the collection which is going to be modified later onp  pI was thinking about how one can detect whether that the current codeThreadcode is the UI accessing to the collection If could know that,  therefore I could select emto dispatch or notem the collection modifications to the UI codeThreadcode. This solution still does not prevent to pass the reference of the UI codeSynchronizationContextcode or codeDispatchercode, though. p  pIt would be nice to have real static properties which could give access, instead we have codeDispatcher.CurrentDispatchercode and codeWinformsSynchronizationContextcode that actually cannot be accessed from another thread... dont really get the point of the design if we still need to pass the reference from the UI codeThreadcode then. But I guess there is some reasons behind the scenes.p  pI may misunderstood and twist the definitions of some terms, so feel free to correct me if thats the case. I do not want to pretend that Im expert or whatsoever.p  pThe fact that delegating systematically everything to the UI seems a bit too much and might somehow overload the message pump cause in this scenario it would be better to create the collection right beforehand within the UI scope but then it would loose the interest of delegating the modifications among several threads.p  pI know that codeIBindingListcode is going to reflect through codeListChangedcode which is subscribed via the Control bound to a codeIBindingListcode inherited collection the collection changes.  Basically those changes are going to be triggered by the nonUI codeThreadcode and that basically the very bottom line. Although, Im bit frustrated by the lack of elegant solutions.p  pBy the way, I am not willing to use the asyncawait and neither some special events of the BackgroundWorker that automatically Marhsall to the UI Thread when they are triggered.

Negative 21406 pI am attempting to write a python program that utilizes Tkinter window switching OOP classes. On the starting page, there is an entry form where the user fills in the relevant fields. After filling the form the button to tests is clicked where the user can select the test after switching framewindow, and the user information entered is simultaneously saved in the specified directory as a .txt file as a result of this button running several methods in class Startpage. The problem occurs when data is received by clicking on the yes or no buttons in the test 1 page. p  pThis page operates in a different class, yet requires a return value from method getinfo defined in the Startpage class to get the user information filename entered to create a second .txt file to store raw data, storing appended yes or no strings depending on the button clicked in test 1s GUI window. p  pHowever this file is never created since Test1 is not receiving any entry data from Startpage classwindow, therefore cannot assign a filename call the getinfo containing the widget.get functions for the second .txt file.p  pThe information is obtained in by the methods in the class correctly and everything works fine. However the problem arises when Test1 asks to receive the widget.get variablesmethods from Startpage.p  pThe error thrown is the following IndexErrorp  precode    Exception in Tkinter callback

Negative 21406 pI am not sure what the keyword I should use to google my problem. But I have been banging my head on the wall for three hours trying to see what is wrong here. It is just a simple pushing object into array. The problem is, when I tried to codeconsole.logcode the array value, two of the codeobjectcode keys value were changed. I am writing this in an AngularJS controller.p  pHere is the sample object which I put on a servicep  precodeonbd.data.add       predefined [         activity  morning jog,         purpose   grow,         days      0 1 2 3 4 5 6,         start     0530,         stop      0600,         meta      repeats everyday on 530 AM for half an hour     ]  codepre  pIn controller, here is the function that got called on codengclickcode event, which will push the said data from service into the AJAX data arrayp  precodeth.setActivity  function data       the data is one of the object inside the predefined      key from the service above     var newAct           activity  data.activity,         purpose   data.purpose,         day       data.days,         start     data.start,         stop      data.stop          th.list.pushnewAct  codepre  pHere is what I got from codeconsole.lognewAct, newActcodep  precodenewAct Object      activity morning jog,     purpose grow,     day 0 1 2 3 4 5 6,     start 0530,     stop 0600 codepre  pp  pWhich is correct, but here is what I got when I codeconsole.loglist, th.listcodep  precodelist [Object]     0 Object         hashKey object136         activity morning jog         day 0 1 2 3 4 5 6         purpose grow         start 0530         stop 0600     length 1     proto Array[0] codepre  pNotice that the key codedaycode and codepurposecode has changed. This happens only when I execute that codeth.setActivitycode function. Any thoughts why such a bizarre behaviorp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 21406 pIm building a site that relies on the output of a machine learning algorithm. All that is needed for the userfacing part of the site is the output of the algorithm class labels for a set of items, which can be easily stored and retrieved from the codedjangocode models. The algorithm could be run once a day, and does not rely on user input.p  pSo this part of the site only depends on codedjangocode and related packages.p  pBut developing, tuning, and evaluating the algorithm uses many other python packages such as codescikitlearncode, codepandascode, codenumpycode, codematplotlibcode, etc. It also requires saving many different sets of class labels.p  pThese dependencies cause some issues when deploying to codeherokucode, because codenumpycode requires codeLAPACKBLAS.code It also seems like it would be good practice to have as few dependencies as possible in the deployed app.p  pHow can I separate the machinelearning part from the userfacing part, but, still have them integrated enough that the results of the algorithm are easily usedp  pI thought of creating two separate projects, and then writing to the userfacing database in some way, but that seems like it would lead to maintance problems managing the dependencies, changes in database schemas etc.p  pAs far as I understand, this problem is a little bit different than using different settings or databases for production and development, because it is more about managing different sets of dependencies.p
Negative 21406 pSo Ive been trying to create a parallel processing effect on the same file through different sources. Parallel processing in sound engineering is essentially when you duplicate a signal twice and apply different effects to each signal ex. if I want a delay to only work on the lower end, then id duplicate the signal and add a biQuad with a lower boost  then an echo to only that signal, but not the original signal.p  pRight now I have the same file identified through different audio variablesp  precodevar mainVerse  document.getElementByIdaudio1 var mainVerseParallel  document.getElementByIdaudio2 codepre  pWhere audio1 and audio2 point to the same source. I also have two sources for each filep  precodevar source  audioCtx.createMediaElementSourcemainVerse var source2  audioCtx.createMediaElementSourcemainVerseParallel  codepre  pI then apply the filters to each nodep  precodevar s  source var s2  source2   source.disconnectaudioCtx.destination source2.disconnectaudioCtx.destination  for var i in filters1   s.connectfilters1[i]  s  filters1[i]    for var i in filters2   s2.connectfilters2[i]  s2  filters2[i]   s.connectaudioCtx.destination s2.connectaudioCtx.destination codepre  pBut the when i play the audio files p  precodemainVerseParallel.play mainVerse.play codepre  pThey dont sync up properly, Ive triedp  precodeaudio.addEventListenercanplaythrough, function, false codepre  pbut it gives a different sound every time I restart the track. Is there a way to fix this syncing issue, or is there a way i can do the parallel processing effect where I dont need  to create two audio variables and two sourcesp

Negative 21406 pI have a handler for SysTick exception which counts ticks and calls other functions f1, f2, f3 whose execution time can be longer than SysTick period. These functions set and clear their active status global variables so if a SysTick exception occurs it can detect an overload and return to interrupted function. p  pI have assigned fixed priority to SysTick exception lets say 16. I want to somehow make possible for SysTick to generate an exception regardless of its prior active status, go to SysTickHandler, increase tick counter and return to interrupted function. p  pOne solution which may be useful is to use BASEPRI. It can be set to priority lower than SysTick so it would enable that exception. Unfortunately, using BASEPRI got me nowhere because nothing happened I set it to max value. BASEPRI value was 0 inside SysTickHandler before I changed it. Should that value be equal to SysTick priority when processor enters handler function Is exception priority loaded automatically in BASEPRI p  pI have also considered for NVIC to have an issue with preempting already active exception but found nothing regarding that in ARM documentation.p  pAlso, return from handler when oveload is detected could set the processor state to thread mode. Lets ignore that for now.p  precodevoid SysTickHandlervoid       ticks     setBASEPRImaxvalue     if f1act  f2act  f3act return     else          f1         f2         f3       codepre  pA simpler example for this problem without return would be to increase tick counter when having an infinite loop inside handler.p  precodevoid SysTickHandlervoid      ticks     setBASEPRImaxvalue     while1  codepre

Negative 21406 pI have a strange CLR strongOutOfMemoryExceptionstrong in a strong64bit CCLIstrong process which has mixed native and managed C code inside. The process has the following structurep  ol liNative C code Main binary li liManaged CCLI code Main binary  li liC code External assemblyli ol  pBoth main binary and external assembly are built for x64 platform. The managed CCLI layer 2 serves as an adapter between native C code 1 and C code 3 which is actually a UI layer working with WPF. .NET Framework version is 4.0.p  pSo I have the Main Binary 1 and 2 built with MACHINEX64 and CLR which makes native C code 1 to work perfectly with 4Gb of memory consumed by the process, but CCLI layer code 2 throws an OutOfMemoryException once I step close to 4Gb. So far it happens in relatively random places but every time I saw it was in ManagedtoNative transitions when CCLI code tried to access a native method.  p  pIt seems like CCLI code inside Main binary doesnt feel itself as a x64ready code, while the tools tell that the binary is in PE 64bit ready format and the native code works well with 4Gb. According to ANTS memory profiler and CLRProfiler the managed heaps are almost empty several hundred of kb.p  pWhat could I miss Doesnt it look like Im linking to wrong .NET framework assemblies which are not x64ready Where should I look first  p  pThanks in advance for any help p

Negative 21406 pI have a WPF application that has a dynamic view that shows images, PDFs, or HTML web pages.

How do I get the request id How do I queryp  pI just want to show progress like on Azure portal  ideally being able to give an estimate of how long to complete.p  pAlternatively am I just supposed to fake the progress report and assume if no failure its in progress without issuep  pThis will apply to many items we need to create like websites, DNS, storage etc.p
