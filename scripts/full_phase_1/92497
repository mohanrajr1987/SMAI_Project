Positive 92497 pIm implementing a hrefhttpsfacebook.github.ioimmutablejs relnofollowImmutable.jsa in a set of a hrefhttpsfacebook.github.ioreact relnofollowReacta components with props containing objects, where Immutable has not been used before.p  pWhile I was rewriting all em someProp.someValue em to em someProp.getsomeValue em since Immutable dont have the props directly accessable, I am just wondering if it could have been possible to have the object properties directly accessable while the object is still immutable.p  pI guess the reason is that if they where directly accessable, they would be mutable because thats how javascript objects work. However, could it not be possible to a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsObjectfreeze relnofollowfreezea the objects in browsers supporting it of course, and still have the mutating methods .set, .map etc create copies instead of changing the object itself the way Immutable workp  pIs that technically possible, and is there any library doing something like this allreadyp
Positive 92497 pI have multiple components which all need to do the same thing. A simple function which maps over their child components and does something to each one. At the moment I am defining this method in each of the components. But I only want to define it once. p  pI could define it in the top level component and then pass it down as a prop. But that doesnt feel quite right. It is more a library function than a prop. It seems to me.p  pWhat is the correct way of doing thisp

Positive 92497 pI am interested in learning web appsite development. I did it as a hobby over 15 years ago, and for awhile now have been wanting to learn it again, obviously the webs much different now. I have been dealing with medical issues that have sidelined me and will continue to for at least the next 6 months, so this is the perfect time for me to learn it. I was surprised how quickly I picked up html and css, but I never learned JS when younger. I did some reading beforehand and my plan for now was to learn about nodeamp express, angular, and I am interested in react sass as well. p  pHowever I didnt want to try and skip plain JS, so its what I have been learning, through books and video. I would say I know the basics so far, functions, objects, arrays, conditionals, loops. I would next likely move into object oriented JS and maybe functional JS. My question is how much JS should you know before trying to move into angularp  pI looked in the archives and didnt see this answered though Im sure its probably in there. Thanks so much, Nickp

I put the code above.p  pTabSystem Has a method to change the currentTab state, this method is as prop in the tabs component that renders each tab.p  precodeReact.createClass   ....   handleClick currentTab      this.setState currentTab    ,    render       return        ltdivgt         ltTabs tabs  tabs2 currentTab  this.state.currentTab onClick  this.handleClickgt       ltdivgt          codepre  pTabs Receive into onClick prop the parent method, this method is as prop into tab component, my goal is to add the onClick method only in the name of the tab.p  precodeReact.createClass   ...   renderTabs       return this.props.tabs.maptab, index gt        var classname  index  this.props.currentTab  active  null       var clickHandler  this.props.onClick.bindnull, index       return          ltTab keytab.name onClickclickHandler indexindex classNameclassname nametab.namegt               ,   render       return        ltdivgt         this.renderTabs       ltdivgt          codepre  pTab Receive again into onClick prop the parent method.p  precodeReact.createClass   render       return        ltspan classNamethis.props.className onClickthis.props.onClickgt         this.props.name       ltspangt          codepre  pWhat is the best way to test this method Do I need in all components the method that works wellp
Positive 92497 pIm building a React Component for rendering an HTML form and Im finding the need to recursively iterate through all children of my parent Form component in order to add extra props to only children components of a certain Type.p  pAn example in JSXp  precodeltFormgt     ltpgtPersonal Informationltpgt     ltInput namefirstname gt     ltInput namelastname gt     ltInput nameemail gt     ltLabelgt         Enter Your Birthday         ltInput namebirthday typedate gt     ltLabelgt ltFormgt codepre  pIn this example, Im using React.Children.map inside my Form component, and then inside the map function Im checking the childs type and the childs type.displayName to determine what element Im dealing with either a native HTML element or a ReactElementp  precodevar newChildren  React.Children.mapthis.props.children, functionchild      if is.inArraychild.type.displayName, supportedInputTypes        var extraChildProps           alertColor this.props.alertColor,         displayErrors this.state.displayErrors              return React.cloneElementchild, extraChildProps      else        return child        .bindthis codepre  pMy problem is that React.Children.map only shallowly iterates through this.props.children, and I would like it to also check children of children of children, etc.  I need to add props to only my Input components so that they know when to display errors, and which color the error message should be displayed, etc.  In the example above, the birthday input does not receive the necessary props, because it is wrapped in a Label component.p  pAny plan for React.Children.map to have a recursive mode or any other utility out there that can accomplish what Im trying to do  p  pAt the end of the day, I would like to write a single function that maps through each and every child even nested ones in order to perform an operation on it in this case cloning.p

Positive 92497 pIve been applying a Fluxlike architecture to my React app, and am wondering if the app state is really meant to be kept in the stores rather than components.

The factory method uses a child container to register the codeIAddresscode dependency that is required by the ViewModel and then resolves the child ViewModelp  precodepublic class Factory      private readonly IUnityContainer container      public FactoryIUnityContainer container              container  container           public void RegisterStuff              container.RegisterInstanceltFuncltIAddress, IAddressViewModelgtgtCreateAddressViewModel           private IAddressViewModel CreateAddressViewModelIAddress model              IUnityContainer childContainer  container.CreateChildContainer          childContainer.RegisterInstancemodel          return childContainer.ResolveltIAddressViewModelgt       codepre  pNow, when the codePersonViewModelcode is initialized, it loops through each codeAddresscode in the Model and calls codeCreateAddressViewModelcode which was injected via the codeFuncltIAddress, IAddressViewModelgtcode argument. codeCreateAddressViewModelcode creates a temporary child container and registers the codeIAddresscode model so that when it resolves the codeIAddressViewModelcode from the child container the codeAddressViewModelcode gets the correct instance injected via its constructor.p  pThis seems to be a good solution to me as the dependencies of the ViewModels are very clear and they are easily testable and unaware of the IoC container. On the other hand, performance is OK but not great as a lot of temporary child containers can be created. Also I end up with a lot of very similar factory methods.p  ul liIs this the best way to inject the child Models into the child ViewModels with Unityli liIs there a better or faster way to do it in other IoC containers, e.g. Autofacli liHow would this problem be tackled with MEF, given that it is not a traditional IoC container but is still used to compose objectsli ul

Negative 92497 pIm relatively new to unit testing, and Ive discovered that while many sources say that you should write unit tests, few of them give any indication where to put them in your project.p  pThe only suggestions that Ive seen are to put them alongside the production code or to build a directory structure that mirrors your production code.  The problem I see with the first approach is that it would become difficult to extract those tests when you make a full build of the system for the second, how would you test functionality that is only visible at the package levelp  pIs there a decent way to organize unit tests so that you can easily automate the build process and still access everything that needs to be testedp  pstrongEDITstrong For those wondering about a specifc language, Im mostly working in Java.

Negative 92497 pLast time I did PHP I worked with CodeIgniter. To implement AJAX I used the XAJAX library, which was extremely simple and was capable of invoking private controller methods. Unfortunately XAJAX does not seem to be compatible with the latest version of CodeIgniter, or it might just be that it is not compatible with php5.25.3.p  pI was thinking of using jQuery, but since jQuery sends requests to an accessible URL it isnt able to invoke private methods. One of the reasons I want to use private controller methods for some of the ajax functionality is because I do not want the functionality to be directly accessible via an URL.p  pSo, is there an ajax library for CodeIgniter that can invoke private controller methodsp  pemEDITem treefaces answer has helped me out by pointing out that jQuery has a .post method. However, I am still looking for a library for CodeIgniter that plugs AJAX functionality in the framework. I would prefer to work with AJAX via PHP and CodeIgniter itself rather than typing out jQuery in my templates. Is there such a library around stillp

This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements  such as a style element in the body section instead of inside head  or two elements that overlap which is not allowed.p      pOne common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTMLs rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects.

Negative 92497 pA question like mine has been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions531759cvolatiledoubleaskeda, but mine is a bit different.  The question is, Why is the volatile keyword not allowed in codeCcode on types codeSystem.Doublecode and codeSystem.Int64code, etc.p  pOn first blush, I answered my colleague, Well, on a 32bit machine, those types take at least two ticks to even enter the processor, and the .Net framework has the intention of abstracting away processorspecific details like that.  To which he responds, Its not abstracting anything if its preventing you from using a feature because of a processorspecific problemp  pHes implying that a processorspecific detail should not show up to a person using a framework that abstracts details like that away from the programmer.  So, the framework or C should abstract away those and do what it needs to do to offer the same guarantees for codeSystem.Doublecode, etc. whether thats a Semaphore, memory barrier, or whatever.  I argued that the framework shouldnt add the overhead of a Semaphore on codevolatilecode, because the programmer isnt expecting such overhead with such a keyword, because a Semaphore isnt necessary for the 32bit types.  The greater overhead for the 64bit types might come as a surprise, so, better for the .Net framework to just not allow it, and make you do your own Semaphore on larger types if the overhead is acceptable.p  pThat led to our investigating what the volatile keyword is all about.  see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryzdxzk5cw.aspxthisa page.  That page states, in the notesp  blockquote   pIn C, using the volatile modifier on a field guarantees that all access to that field uses VolatileRead or VolatileWrite.p blockquote  pHmmm.....codeVolatileReadcode and codeVolatileWritecode both support our 64bit types My question, then, is, p  blockquote   pWhy is the volatile keyword not allowed in codeCcode on types codeSystem.Doublecode and codeSystem.Int64code, etc.p blockquote

This seems to be fully within their power, and it seems incredibly negligent that they dont do this for people who have bought their software.p  pPlease, if you could provide clear step by step help, because Im very ignorant when it comes to development configurations and stuff.

Negative 92497 pI have 3 selects that contain different categories. My website shows places to go out to eat and then I have one select that will let you choose between restaurants, bars... Another select will let you chose between a range of prices and the last one will let you chose the kind of atmosphere the place has.p  pThe way I set it up is the followingp  pI have my 3 selects and a .click function that will pop when you chose something in any of the dropdownsp  precode.formcomer div.jqTransformSelectWrapper ul li a, .formsalir div.jqTransformSelectWrapper ul li a, .formdormir div.jqTransformSelectWrapper ul li a, .formvisitar div.jqTransformSelectWrapper ul li a.clickfunction  var index this.attrindex var sel this.closestdiv.childrenselect.attrid var value  select.jqTransformHidden optioneqindex.attrvalue        .ajax      type POST,      url form.attraction,      data value  value  ampsel  sel,      dataType html,      success functiondata          contpag.htmldata               return false prevent default browser action          codepre  pIts a jqTransformed select, that makes the code harder.

Negative 92497 pI heard that a hrefhttpeventespresso.com relnofollowEvent Espressoa can do anything that the a hrefhttpwww.eventbrite.comlwordpress relnofollowEventbritea do. But I am confused about the Facebook part. Does it just support the useless share button and not the event link on the Facebook And according to the showcase on their website, there are nothing special for me to think it is better than the normal event management.p  pIm new to this area. And I really want to know if this plugin is really powerful as stated. I cant find a good case for study, and their website seems not well support for the users to find the useful information.p  pIs there a link of a wonderful website with this plugin or another plugin that do most things that Eventbrite do Or some good tutorial about itp
Negative 92497 pHere is a generic imaginary example made up for this post. Consider 6 classesp  precodeTableFactory, TableData, TableCRUD, TableSchema, DBConnect, Logger.  codepre  pcodeTableFactorycode is the outer class, lets say it holds a codeTableDatacode object for a  DB table.p  pIn this codeTableFactorycode,  there are no calls to codeTableSchemacode or codeDBConnectcode or codeloggercode.  I am aiming for an example of inner objects not needed in outer scope.p  pcodeTableDatacode is an inner fetches and operates on the data, so it needs codeTableCrudcode, codeDBConnectcode and codeLoggercode.p  pcodeTableCrudcode  contains codeTableSchemacode and needs codeDBConnectcode, and codeLoggercode.p  pcodeDbConnectcode itseld, to make things fun, needs a Logger. My example is now 3 scopes deep.p  pstrongMy Question is pretty simple, if you have an object 3 or more scopes in that are not called upon by objects on outer scope, how does one send those objects from outer to inner scope without breaking the Interface Segregation Principle  TableFactory shouldnt have to deal with DBConnect or Logger needed by inner objects.strongp  pIf one respects basic OOP principles and aims for easy testability  you would have outer objects needing injection of the 5 objects, and then have getter methods that woud pass the objects needed further up the chain.  And inner scoped objects would in turn require injection of the dependencies of their inner  3scopedeep objects, with getters for those too.  This makes for outer scoped objects requiring many dependencies, and getters just to pass those on.p  pIs there an alternative to this objectpassing methodology,  something I missed along the way Please share Any linkscomments appreciated.p

Negative 92497 pI Built a simple payment system integrating paypal with wordpress in php basically I build a list where each list item retrieves metadata from a specific page in wordress a page for every product and with this data build dynamically an add to cart paypal button.  this worked fine but..

I found a php program thats supposed to do that and from what I see in different internet forums  most of the time delivers to this promise , and I think I followed all of paypal instructions with the certificate private, public, paypals etc..p  pWhile I dont get any error from the html page  when I push the add to cart button I get a paypal error We have detected a problem with this shopping cart. If the problem persists, please contact the merchant. but I dont have any details why and what Im doing wrong..p  pI have a merchant account with paypal.p  pIn order to remove unnecessary clutter and noise I built a test page with static data to check if the button works right and here it is glad for any helpp  pthe basic test pagep  precodeltphp includeonce testfunctions.php inserting some test data themetacost100 themetanametestbook themetashipping20 building the paypal button line line.ltform targetpaypal actionhttpswww.paypal.comcgibinwebscr methodpost targetblank idpayform gt             ltinput typehidden namecmd valuecartgt                         ltinput typehidden nameencrypted value line. buildbuttonthemetacost,themetaname,themetashipping line.gt line.ltinput typeimage srchttpswww.paypalobjects.comWEBSCR640201104291heILibtnbtncartSM.gif border0 namesubmit altPayPal       gt                 ltimg alt border0 srchttpswww.paypalobjects.comWEBSCR640201104291heILiscrpixel.gif width1 height1gt                 ltformgtltbrgt echo line  gt codepre  pthe php buildbutton and encrypting functionsp  precodeltphp function buildbuttonamount,bname,shipping  Sample PayPal Button Encryption Copyright 20062010 StellarWebSolutions.com Not for resale   license agreement at httpwww.stellarwebsolutions.comeneula.php Updated 2010 02 01    form  arraycmd gt cart,         business gt XXXX.CO.il,  changed from the original         certid gt XXXXXXXXXXX, changed from the original     shipping gt shipping,         invoice gt , check what this is         currencycode gt ILS,         noshipping gt 0, refers to shipping address         addgt1,     itemname gt bname,     amount gt amount            encrypted  paypalencryptform   return encrypted  function paypalencrypthash      Sample PayPal Button Encryption Copyright 20062010 StellarWebSolutions.com     Not for resale  license agreement at     httpwww.stellarwebsolutions.comeneula.php      private key file to use   MYKEYFILE  homepaypalmyprvkey.pem  public certificate file to use MYCERTFILE  homepaypalmyprvkey.pem    Paypals public certificate PAYPALCERTFILE  homepaypalpaypalcert.pem   path to the openssl binary OPENSSL  usrbinopenssl      if fileexistsMYKEYFILE          echo ERROR MYKEYFILE MYKEYFILE not foundn          if fileexistsMYCERTFILE          echo ERROR MYCERTFILE MYCERTFILE not foundn          if fileexistsPAYPALCERTFILE          echo ERROR PAYPALCERTFILE PAYPALCERTFILE not foundn              if fileexistsOPENSSL                 echo error with openssl OPENSSL not found n                Assign Build Notation for PayPal Support     hash[bn] StellarWebSolutions.PHPEWP2 this is not needed cause i dont have a ewp      data       foreach hash as key gt value          if value                echo Adding to blob keyvaluen             data . keyvaluen                    opensslcmd  OPENSSL smime sign signer MYCERTFILE inkey MYKEYFILE  .                         outform der nodetach binary ltltEOFndatanEOFn   .

Negative 92497 pIm developing a java application, using a 32Bit native library which Im accessing via JNA. On MacOS X Snow Leopard its possible to pass the parameter d32 to the JVM, which causes the JVM to start in 32Bit mode. Ive got a launcher application, which sets some environment variables and then starts the main application. This is also the place where it is decided to launch the main application with the d32 switch, if the program is executed on MacOS.p  pSo heres my question Is there a similar way to solve this on Windows or Linuxp  pIt would be the best if it was possible to run the 64Bit JVM in 32Bit mode. But Im not really afraid to tell my users to install an additional 32Bit JVM, thats not the problem. The problem is, that I would have to tell my launcher application where the 32Bit JVM can be found, as the first one in the PATH variable could be the 64Bit one.p  pThanks in advance,p  paRestlessp

Negative 92497 pWe are working on a Spring 3.0.5 Web MVCbased application. In our code we quite often do something like thisp  precodeModelAttributeModelKeys.SOMEBEAN public SomeBean newSomeBean    return new SomeBean  codepre  pI think this is not necessary. But if it really wasnt, then I wonder how has this managed to slip through so many code reviews In my understanding, if a controller method wanted a NEW SomeBean, then annotating a parameter in that method with ModelAttribute should be enough Spring would then use the default constructor to new up the required bean for invoking the controller method, e.g.p  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST public String doIt   ModelAttributeModelKeys.SOMEBEAN final SomeBean bean,   final BindingResult bindingResult    ...  codepre  phere, Spring would new up an instance of SomeBean and try to databind into it from the POSTed data, right Theres no need for the method as shown in the first code snippet Please can you confirm this or provide me with your thoughts on this Would I be introducing a risk if I just went ahead and removed all these methods that do nothing other than new up an empty beanp

Negative 92497 pI am in the final stage of developing an iPhone game and I am dealing with a crash that appears to be memory related.p  pIt happens only on the device when I load a game level several times 10 to 15 times. I get some memory warnings around the 8th time and if I keep loading the same level it finally crashes with this message on the consolep  precodeProgram received signal  0. Data Formatters temporarily unavailable, will retry after a continue. Unknown error loading shared library   DeveloperusrliblibXcodeDebuggerSupport.dylib codepre  pSome goolge search told me this message usually means the app has run out of memory. p  pI ran the app under instruments but it didnt detect any memory leaks and the total allocation remained around 1,5Mb both live and overall bytes reaching 5,4Mb for a fraction of a second everytime I loaded a level. This doesnt seem a lot since a leaky test app didnt crash before allocating more than 30Mb on the same device iPhone 3GS. I am new to instruments so maybe I am missing something.p  pI ve been struggling with this bug for days now and I would be really thankful if someone could point me in the right direction.p

Negative 92497 pi recently a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6398079isflashorflexbettertobuildauserinteractiveorderingwizardwebsiteasked this questiona and i got a lot of great answers breaking down the difference between flash and flex which was very informative and helpful.  p  pOne of my main parts of the question never got answered so i wanted to focus on that as it was difficult to change to focus on the last questions once it got into a flash versus flex general debatep  pIn the first Site link on that question, as the use makes selections, these selections are getting applied to an image and you are building up a master image with all of the accessories chosen.  This is similar to a lot of these build a doll websites i see but there is one main difference that goes to the heart of my question.p  pFor example, on strongstep 3strong, you choose a color and get something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8c6Hq.png altenter image description herep  pthen on strongstep 4strong, as you choose accessories, the images changes to thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4WfAj.png altenter image description herep  porp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAsrHD.png altenter image description herep  porp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZK4tM.png altenter image description herep  pNow this site is using flash or flex, etc and people have told me this could be replicated without flash 100 bysimply looking at using zindex with images and jquery  css but in the images above, it doesnt seem like these additional images are just being layered on top because in some cases the accessories is partially behind the original image stars in the back of the cake, etc. So it seems like something more sophisticated is going on.  I cant seem to find any examples on the web that show this capability in any tutorial or  examplep  pI wanted to get feedback to if the follow capabilities where available just using regular css, floats, etc or there was some particular feature in flash  flex that i should be looking at  to give this capabilities where you can merge images together to give you the affect in the images above.p

Can some one please show me how to simply load images from the device to a list view. There is no book, tutorial, or post on here that just simply shows how to do this and its kind of funny and crazy at the same time.p
Negative 92497 pIm working on an app for a client and the client wants absolutely everything to be shareable using sharekit. One of the views that the client wants is a photo gallery that can be easily updated and viewed. Ive looked around at folks who have done this and I particularly like the way the Obama 2012 app does it using flickr. This brings me to the question, Im trying to use the flickr api to display a photo gallery that will allow sharekit to share the url to the image but am hitting a brick wall. Ive searched for a few days now and havent found a tutorial that shows a working example in the way I need it, if anyone has done something similar or knows a good tutorial that would be greatly appreciated.p

Why not use codeConstrainedCopycode here  p  p2 How much would be the cost of using codeConstrainedCopy code all the time then I am assuming there would be more logic added to codeConstrainedCopy code  p

I recall when I was playing with IBM 1130 APL back in 1970.  This was an APL interpreter that ran in 8k words, needless to say, it was limited.  For example, it had a roll but no deal. The interpreter phased itself in and out of memory, the 1130 supported code overlays, it would separate your subroutines into groups and when one group called another, it would load the new group off of disk yes, pseudo swapping in 8k. So I wrote versions of deal, using various schemes, and randomly, we would hit one that could phase in and out without seeking, and that version, no matter how badly written with how many lines and how many interpreter actions would run 10 times as fast as any other.  I had no idea what I was doing, I would keep adding ravels and meaningless assignments and breaking statements across lines or combining them until I got one that would run without seeking.  A 52 deal 52 that was seeking could take 45 seconds.  p  pAnd then last night I calculated the 150,000th Fibonacci number in J.  It had to be the 64 bit version, and it took one hour, 17 minutes.  I used exact arithmetic, the number has 31349 digits and it starts 1012838344936638038......  And I realized that the 1130 could never have calculated this, the number would not have fit, cause you need three of them and the biggest one made had 32k 16 bit words.

Negative 92497 pIm developing an iOS app which syncs with Dropbox. I use the Dropbox SDK for iOS.

Negative 92497 pSo I decided back when I was coding to have different tables for each type of content. Now I am stuck solving this. Basically my notification system ranks the newest content by its timestamp currently. This is inaccurate however because there is a small chance that someone would submit content at the same time as another person, and incorrect ranking would occur.p  pNow if I had all my content in a single table, I would simply rank it by an autoincrementing variable. Is there a way to implement this autoincrement integer across multiple tables e.g. When something is inserted into emtable1em, id0, something is inserted into emtable2em, id1. Or do I have to recode all my stuff into a single table.p  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pThe reason I have content in multiple tables is because its organized and it would reduce load stress. I dont really care about the organization anymore, because I can just access the data through a GUI I coded, Im just wondering about the load stress.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm using PHP 5 with MySQL.p

Negative 92497 pHopefully this will be an easy one to answer. p  pI am working on a table that requires MTD data. One of our SQL guys told me to use p  precodeMONTH monthtodate 11 codepre  pWhere codemonthtodatecode is set to codeGetDatecode in the parameter list in SQL Server Management Studio. So in theory, he says, it should select the month 11 and then get today and return all the requested data in between those two dates. But Im thinking this isnt correct. p  pIn looking at my data Im starting to think that Its just returning data for the whole month of November instead of just MTD. I guess, technically, anything that has 0 wont be calculated. However that just means its poorly written code correctp  pIn your opinions, would this be the better way to return MTD datap  precodeproductiondate lt today and ProductionDate gt DATEADDmm, DATEDIFFmm, 0, today, 0 codepre  pThanks in advance everyonep

Negative 92497 pIve been coding with PHP and MySQL for about a year now and have gotten the hang of it pretty well constructing really complicated queries with joins and calculated fields and all the other joys of MySQL hasnt been a problem for me in months.p  pBUT theres something syntactically screwy with the following chunk of code that I cant figure out  even though its impossibly simple, and, even more infuriating, is closely related to other parts of the project that Im working on and which works flawlessly.p  pHeres the problem code Im trying to run, followed by the bugchecking Ive already done to try to isolate the problem.p  pIf anyone has any suggestions, Id be totally grateful because Im beginning to lose my mind.p  h1Problemh1  pIm really losing my mind over this, so please dont laugh when you see the codep  precodequerySELECT countsomefield FROM dbname WHERE otherfield.myvariable. codepre  pMy query finds no results when using a certain variable as part of a field search  even though I know that there are over 900 records in the database that should match.p  h1Bugcheckingh1  ul liBecause I know the value of the variable Im passing to the query, Ive tried hardcoding it into the query and it works fine.  li liIve run the query in the MySQL console again, of course, hardcoded instead of with the variable and it works fine. ul liTo my mind, these two facts eliminate the possibility that theres something syntactically incorrect with the PHP version of the query.  li ulli liIn order to eliminate all possible database connection issues and to make sure the problem isnt related to iterating through the results returned, instead of trying to get the actual results, Ive altered my original query to return only the count of the results and have incorporated the standard codeor diemysqlerrorcode statements during the connection sequence.  The query is executing, but is finding 0 results, so that eliminates the possibility that its a connection issue.  li liIve verified that the field Im checking is the correct field for the information Im looking for like I said, it runs fine if I hardcode the variable into the query... which, of course, will not be an option in the finished code.  li liIve checked the type of the variable before trying to pass it into the query figuring that maybe, because its pulled from a returned xml earlier in the script, that maybe it was showing up as an array or something.

Negative 92497 pI need to be able to get a sequential number I dont mind if there are holes in the generation and I think a SQL Sequence would be the perfect match for this.p  pI am working with the Play framework and it uses JPA2 backed by hibernate.p  pMy problem right now is that I cant seem to get Hibernate to generate the Sequences as part of the automatic ddl update on start of the application.p  pEvery documentation I can find about using SequenceGenerator seems to be related to the Entity Id, and not how to define a sequence independent of the one used for the entity id.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT Just to give more context for the question, what I am doing is a implementing a service for keeping highscores, the first time a player starts the game it will ask the server for a guest account. p  pGuest accounts have a username in the form of player  number like player123123 where the number would be generated from the sequence that I am trying to use.p  pWhen the user registers he will be able to change the username to something custom, but not in the form of player  anything, so that the namespace player  number remains free to use for guest accounts. p  pEDIT2 For now I got it to work by defining an extra useless entity that will never be used and just use the Sequence from that entity, but it is an ugly hack.p  pIgnoring possible solutions hacks for my concrete problem, I would like to know if it is possible with hibernate and jpa2 to declare extra not the one used for id generation sequences asociated to an entity or independent from any entity and have hibernate create them in the db automatically.p

I am using this tutorial a hrefhttpccn.ucla.eduwikiindex.phpSettingUpandUsingGitUsingPublic.2FPrivateKeyswithGIT relnofollowUsing PublicPrivate Keys with GITa.p  pHowever I am guessing this is for using the GIT terminal. I am typing the following command in cygwinp  precodesshkeygen t dsa codepre  pIt cant find that, so I added on git in front so that it would recognize it as a GIT command, so I didp  precodegit sshkeygen t dsa codepre  pIt now says codesshkeygen is not a commandcode.

Negative 92497 pIm maintaining a Rails 3.1 app. App db has more than 50 tables and maybe 30 of those need seed data for the app to function correctly. p  pApp has plenty of statistical data as a seed data and some tables contain more than 150 000 records. I have been testing using fixtures actually using rake tasks to create fixture files from devdb. Because of huge fixture files, testing has become slower and slower. Were talking about 20 minutes to run the whole test suite.p  pAt the time I started making tests, fixtures were way to go. Currently Im not so sure anymore. I keep reading about tools like factorygirl, capybara, rspec and spork. Ive done few tests with those and they seem nice and fun to use.p  pemBasically Id like to know how would you test this kind of setupem p  pFixtures are way too slow. Thanks for the helpp
Negative 92497 pthis is a noobie question regarding tree maps. I have read through the Java API and other documentation but am still unclear about just how this works.p  pFrom my understanding, a Tree in java or any language is sort of like a family tree where you have sayp  precodeLayer 1                               OldestGuy     Layer 2       OldGuy1       Oldguy2         OldGuy3        OldGuy4           OldGuy5 Layer 3   Guy1 Guy2 Guy3 Guy4 Guy5  Guy6........ etc codepre  pWhere Layer 1 has 1 value i.e. a central node and from there there can be arbitrary amounts of values or Guys in each subsequent layer, and some of the branches can be longer than others for example it could go OldestGuy  OldGuy1  Guy1 amp Guy2...Guyn   whilst at the same time another branch is just OldestGuy  OldGuy4p  pWith this ind mind I am trying to add values to a TreeMap in specific locations of specific branches whilst making specific connections but all I seem to be getting is the same results as a HashMap. p  pit seems what I want to do requires something more than the TreeMap ....as the Key or Layer would be the same for several different valuesp  pAny suggestions  explanations would be fantastic because I feel as if I am seriously barking up the wrong tree with this one.p  pI have seen examples of this being done using googles .jar, such as a family tree but I am just trying to understand this as there seems to be lots of conflict between TreeMap and Trees and how you can store data in them.p

Negative 92497 pAre there projects or plugins that utilize javascript or jQuery to scroll diagonallyp  pe.g. when you scroll down your content, It would be pulled at the topleft corner of the browser and when you scroll up your content would be pulled at the bottomright of the corner.p  pI see some similar projectwebsite that they animate their elements when scroll. Most of the site that use javascript has some lags with the effect though. Another ive seen is using html5  parallax effect similar to Nike a Better World httpcoding.smashingmagazine.com20110712behindthescenesofnikebetterworldp  pCan you point me where can be a good starting point Basically I want to scroll the items diagonally leftorright.

An organization may use mobile devices to improve clinician workflow, bedside information gathering and reporting, or a host of other care delivery applications. In some cases, individuals may use their own mobile devices to meet their personal workflow requirements.   Whatever purpose the device serves, healthcare organizations must be prepared to understand all the issues related to mobile device use.

We characterize the differences in the offices based on the levels of computerization in terms of workflow, sources of time delay, and barriers to using EHR systems to support the entire workflow.  The study was based on a combination of questionnaires, interviews, in situ observations, and data collection efforts. This study was not intended to be a fullscale timeandmotion study with precise measurements but was intended to provide an overview of the potential sources of delays while performing office tasks. The study follows an interpretive model of case studies rather than a largesample statistical survey of practices. To identify timeconsuming tasks, workflow maps were created based on the aggregated data from the offices. The results from the study show that specialty physicians are more favorable toward adopting EHR systems than primary care physicians are. The barriers to adoption of EHR systems by primary care physicians can be attributed to the complex workflows that exist in primary care physician offices, leading to nonstandardized workflow structures and practices. Also, primary care physicians would benefit more from EHR systems if the systems could interact with external entities.   ltdescriptiongt         ltitemgtltitemgt             lttitlegtAHIMA Comments on Proposed Modification to ICD9 Procedure Codeslttitlegt             ltpubDategt4132012 24658 PMltpubDategt             ltlinkgthttpwww.ahima.orgdownloadspdfsadvocacyAHIMA20commentsCMprocedure0312.pdfltlinkgt             ltauthorgtwebmasterahima.orgltauthorgt             ltcategorygtNews  Alertsltcategorygt             ltdescriptiongtThe American Health Information Management Association AHIMA respectfully submits the following comments on the proposed procedure code modifications presented at the ICD9CM Coordination and Maintenance CampM Committee meeting held on March 5.ltdescriptiongt         ltitemgtltitemgt             lttitlegtAHIMA Foundation Establishes Research Innovation and Leadership Institutelttitlegt             ltpubDategt4132012 24747 PMltpubDategt             ltlinkgthttpahimafoundation.orgPolicyResearchRILI.aspxltlinkgt             ltauthorgtwebmasterahima.orgltauthorgt             ltcategorygtNews  Alertsltcategorygt             ltdescriptiongtFor the HIM profession to remain relevant and influential we must have a dynamic and expanding knowledge base and defined set of desired skills and expertise.

Negative 92497 pWere building some kind of automatic self describing REST service live doc generation. For this we have a controller method that looks for all controller beans and fetches also the requestmapping information to display them in a nice friendly html page.p  pFor this we use the MetadataReader created via CachingMetadataReaderFactory to fetch the Metadata of the class. When we get the MethodMetaData for the public methods we find the RequestMapping annotation along with produces and value parameters, but the method field is always an empty array, although we have it configured in the source code and the mapping works. So the information should be somewhere. This is quite puzzling p  pEDIT method field is empty The RequestMapping Annotation has a method field, which is an array of RequestMethod objects. If you try to read that from the MethodMetaData instance its an empty array. Example metadata.getAnnotationAttributesRequestMapping.class.getName.getmethodp  pI tried to find the reason in the spring framework source code, but havent found the reason so far...p  pAny ideasp  pFYI Were using Spring 3.1p

Which is fine, I can achieve that with jQuery, but as soon as I submit the form again, the client is not on the codeModelMapcode anymore.p  pI have even tried adding the saved client to the codeModelMapcode of my POST method but even that didnt work.p  pIm not entirely sure if Im doing it the right way. To be honest, every tutorial Ive seen uses more or less what Im doing but strongNONEstrong of them have a PUT request  mostly deal with creation of objects, which I dont have an issue.p  pWhat I have in mind is that I might need to have a controller method mapping to codesecureclientsclientIdcode with codeHTTP.GETcode and another controller method mapping codesecureclientsclientIdcode with codeHTTP.PUTcode.p  pBut Im not sure if that makes sense, so Im a bit lost.p  ul liShould I create my controllers entirely on JSON callsli liShould I redirect the user and forget about AJAX calls in this scenarioli ul  pSuggestions are more than appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 92497 pI am running a service in the background that reads GPSNetwork location and needs to do the followingp  ul liprun in background without interruptions on app restart and keep it alive as much as possible without being killed This is solved with the help of Merlins comment bellowpli lipon a new location received, call a web service and send the read locationpli liphave a repetitive task running every 60 seconds and resend last location to the web service. This will help in case the user stays in the same position.pli ul  pThere are a few things I have considered and Im not sure if I understood right. The service runs in the same thread as the main app, so sending the location to the server on same thread as the UI thread may trigger UI freezes and this is not good. Also Im not sure if GPSNetwork listeners have their own threads or use the same thread as the app.p  pHere is a shortened code of the service to make things clearerp  precodepublic class GPSLoggerService extends Service  Override public void onCreate      locationManager  LocationManager getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE   Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId       locationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER, 0, 50, locationListenerNetwork     locationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 0, 50, locationListenerGps      scheduleTaskExecutor  Executors.newScheduledThreadPool5     scheduleTaskExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRatenew Runnable          Override         public void run                  updateLocationlastLocation         , 60, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS      return STARTSTICKY   LocationListener locationListenerGps  new LocationListener      Override     public void onLocationChangedLocation location          updateLocationlocation      ...

The scheduleTaskExecutor I belive its not the way to go. Sometimes, even after I call stopService the service remains alive, even if I tell the TaskExecutor to shutDown. I cant find another explanation for which the service isnt stoping.  So to recap I need to send the location each time the listeners receive a new location and resend it every 60 seconds. I also need to be able to stop the service quickly with active threads canceling.p  pHow would you recommend me to handle my case p

Negative 92497 pAfter reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11385331cprogramlinkingwithsharedlibrarywithoutsettingldlibrarypath11385376comment1500678611385376this questiona, my first reaction was that the user is not seeing the error because he specifies the location of the library with codeLcode.p  pHowever, apparently, the codeLcode option only influences where the linker looks, and has no influence over where the loader looks when you try to run the compiled application.p  pMy question then is whats the point of codeLcode Since you wont be able to run your binary unless you have the proper directories in codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode anyway, why not just put them there in the first place, and drop the codeLcode, since the linker looks in codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode automaticallyp

Negative 92497 pThe scenario is we have a WCF service that consumes methods from an internal web service that we have built.p  pThe WCF service is very lightweight.p  pWe want to secure this WCF service so only certain clients can consume it it is currently sitting on a public facing server.p  pWe do not have the ability to install certificates on this public facing server so we are wondering the best securiyt model to use.p  pIdeally the thought was somehow it can be configured so that the client uses a certificate that the WCF service simply passes on to the internal web service as this is on a server we do control and the certificate authentication then happens.p  pIs this possible.. If not are there any other security options that we could employ..p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 92497 pI have two tables say Parent and Child. I want parent and Child to link to each other using a foreign key. The child table has two fields, one among them being countrysig. This countrysig is actually made from joining two fields in strongparent tablestrong named strongcountrystrong and strongcodestrong. Eg If country is IN and code is 15 then countrysig is strongIN.15strong.p  pNow I want that during creation of django model for parent table, it should automatically create this field countrysig strongderived fromstrong country and code so that I can reference it to the child table.p  pPS  Since the parent table is very large, I dont want to create another field in the db derived from those two fields, but I can tweak the other table child table to divide the countrysig field into two columns with country and code but that will not work since django doesnt support composite primary key.p  pstrongEDITstrong Actually I am implementing it in tastypie, I want tastypie to think as if it is a real field.

Negative 92497 pSo I know there are tons of questions similar to this but I havent been able to find an answer to this specific question. p  pIf I have a two column div layout, I want the div on the left to have a fixed width of 250px and a marginleft 5 just the way I want it setupf for my design...p  pthe second div the one on the right I want to basically go to the end of the screen to the right. So the left div is 250px with a marginleft of 5 and I want the second div the one on the right to fill the entire rest of the browser.p  pOn the second div I have tried a float left with a 100 width, but that makes the second div go to the bottom of the first, and fills up the screen. If I give the second div a fixed witdth, of coarse the float works but it doesnt fill up the browser window...and if you move the browser window smaller than the second div, it gets pushed down again to the bottom of the first div...p  pIs there anyway, with just css, to have one div with fixed widthand marginleft with a percentage, and the next div straight to the right of the first like a float would normally work with a percentage of 100 or something like that so that it fills the rest of the screenp  po ya I also need both divs to have height 100 if that makes a difference...Thanksp

Negative 92497 pIm writing an ARCenabled framework which creates a hierarchy of objects, not unlike Cocoas view hierarchy. Each controller object can have several subcontrollers. Controllers may have references to each other, which poses the potential risk of creating a retain cycle.p  pstrongI know how to avoid retain cycles. I want to know if theres a way for me to detect programmatically that a retain cycle exists and prevents an object from deallocatingstrongp  pAt some point, the existing root controller will be replaced by a new root controller. Since Im using ARC I cant use retainCount to check the existing controllers retain count. Which is not to be trusted anyway from what Ive read.p  pI have a test setup where the root controller has two sub controllers, and each of them has a strong reference to the other. In that case the root controller does not run dealloc, neither do the other two controllers when the root controller is replaced with a new controller. As expected. I was thinking that given this scenario, there should be some way for me to determine whether that root controller did actually deallocate or not.p  pstrongPossible Solutionstrong I did assign the tobereplaced root controller to a zeroing weak property on a global object shortly before replacing the controller. Then I have setup a timer so that after a fraction of a second I check if the property is nil or not. If its nil, the controller did deallocate. If its not nil, it probably indicates a memory leak likely to have been caused by a retain cycle somewhere in the hierarchy. In that case I print a log statement for as long as the replaced controller is not nil to get the developers attention.p  pThis works, but are there any alternative better solutions Or possible caveats with this solution p  pSpecifically, how much time can pass before the object deallocates  is this guaranteed to be instantaneous or can deallocation be delayed and if so, for how longp

Negative 92497 pI am using Fluent NHibernate for my ORM. In doing so I am trying to use the NHibernate LINQ syntax to fetch a set of data with the power of LINQ. The code I have works and executes correctly with the exception being that a timeout is thrown if it takes longer than roughly 30 seconds to run. The question I have is how do I extend the default 30 second timeout for LINQ statements via NHibernatep  pI have already seen the posts a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12406717linqtimeouttimeoutexpiredherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11821236sqltimeoutexpiredherea, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2519754settinglinqtonhibernateadocommandtimeoutherea but the first two refer to setting the DataContexts Timeout property, which does not apply here, and the third refers to  setting the timeout in XML, which also does not apply because I am using Fluent NHibernate to generate the XML on the fly. Not only that but the post is 2 years old and Fluent NHibernate has changed since.p  pWith the ICriteria objects and even HQL I can specify the timeout, however that is not the goal here. I would like to know how to set that same timeout and use LINQ.p  pExample codep  precode    using var session  SessionFactory.OpenSession     using var transaction  session.BeginTransaction              var query  from mem in session.QueryltMembergt                      select mem         query  query.Wherewhere statement         int start  currentPage  1  max         if start gt 0             query  query.Skipstart.Takemax         else             query  query.Takemax          var list  query.ToList         transaction.Commit         return list      codepre  pThis code where statement does not matter works for all purposes except where a timeout occurs. p  pAny help is appreciated.

Negative 92497 pIm attempting to write to the stdin of a subprocess both are java apps.  Reading the processs output works fine, but inputting does not work using either codePrintStreamcode or codePrintWritercode.  Here is a sample program that I wrote to test the odd behavior, which I run with no arguments.  That then runs the same program as a subprocess.  The sub process just reads input and echoes it into the output.  The main process takes stdin and writes it to the subprocess input and outputs the subprocess output to stdout.p  pThe trouble is, this doesnt work.  The codenextLinecode of the subprocess doesnt match with the codeprintlncode statement in the parent process, so the subprocess never outputs anything.p  pWhy is this happening, and how do I fix it preferably on the parent process, because I cant alter the child process of the main project.p  precodeimport java.lang. import java.io. import java.util.Scanner  public class ProcTest     public static Scanner stdin     public static String line     public static Process sub      public static BufferedReader childout     public static PrintWriter childin      public static void mainString[] args             stdin  new ScannerSystem.in             ifargs.length gt 0 ampamp args[0].equalsy                     whiletrue                             line  stdin.nextLine                             System.out.printlnline                                  else                     try                             sub  Runtime.getRuntime.execjava ProcTest y                             childout  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReadersub.getInputStream                             childin  new PrintWritersub.getOutputStream                             whiletrue                                     childin.printlnstdin.nextLine                                     childin.flush                                     whilechildout.ready System.out.println childout.readLine                                                   catchIOException e                             e.printStackTrace                                         codepre

Negative 92497 pAs the title indicates, Im having trouble updating a datagrid in WPF. Basically what Im trying to accomplish is a datagrid, that is connected to a SQL Server database, that updates automatically once a user enters information into a few textboxes and clicks a submit button. Youll notice that I have a command that joins two tables. The data from the QuoteData table will be inserted by a different user at a later time. For now my only concern is getting the information from the textboxes and into the GeneralInfo table, and from there into my datagrid. The code, which Ill include below compiles fine, but when I hit the submit button, nothing happens.

Negative 92497 pEvening everyone.p  pI seem to have hit an odd problem when trying to pass an object to another objects constructor whos constructor also relies on the object its being passed to.p  pFor instance, take the example belowp  precodeToolBar myToolBar  new ToolBarwebPanel WebPanel webPanel  new WebPanelmyToolBar codepre  pHowever when constructing ToolBar it returns a NullPointerException. Ofcourse thats because webPanel isnt constructed yet and it requires it.p  pBoth of the decelerations and initialization must remain in the same class called BuildUI since its where I set up the properties. It also doesnt make sense for a ToolBar to create a webPanel object and vice versa.p  pIm also not sure if thats even good programming practice, since both objects require references to each other.p  pAny advice here is much appreciated.

Negative 92497 pIm trying to connect to Active Directory to look for a specific user, edit that users properties and save the changes. Seems like a simple task, but Im having a hard time putting this thing together. p  pIve tried using VBscript, and allthough it seems it can be done, I have to add the administrator username and password in clear text. Which is NOT a good idea. The script is also triggered from regular users which have no access to Active Directory. So the initial script needs to fire a second script that is run as domain admin.p  pSomeone gave me a tip though. Create a web page or a windows service that the script can call. And that service or webpage connects to AD and makes the actual changes. I guess a windows service would be the cleanest way of doing this. p  pBut I only have Visual Studio Express and it seems I cannot create a windows service with that. The initial script needs to be vbscript, because its being run from a software where only vbscript is supported. p  pSo what would be the ideal solution here Would it be possible for the first vbscript to collect the data it needs, pass those as arguments to a second vbscript that makes the actual changes A vbscript would be easier to maintain, if I need to update more user properties than those I need right now. p  pWe do use Sharepoint as well. Perhaps I could create a webpart that uses javascript to collect the data passed from the initial vbscript and connect to AD that way Just brainstorming here to find the most appropriate solution  p

At the moment its just hiding  showing panels, changing test in a Window, but I need to create a transition to move the panel out of frame and back with the push of a buttno with lets say 30FPS. Ive tried to google solutions for this but so far Ive only found solutions to use mouse as the vector X,Y point and move items with a mouse and one library here a hrefhttpcode.google.compdotnettransitions relnofollowhttpcode.google.compdotnettransitionsap  pExcept the library doesnt work with a panel that has a background image and a label on top. The panel  label blinks in an out so that the background comes visible for microseconds.

Now is there any other solution for this program I am creating Different programming language, a library, some way One person suggested C and GDI but I have honestly no idea how that would work as its just shapes and I want to use images.p

Negative 92497 pIm trying to analyze a dynamic language that can have multiple translations, depending upon probabilities. I have a few defined types in my language such as number, vector, etc...p  pFor example, if we were to see the expression ab then that could be the addition of two numbers or it could be the addition of two vectors. A number is more likely and so we think the best representation is the sum of two numbers. However it is possible that they are vectors, and so I still want to keep this less likely representation.p  pIf later on I saw ab then I know that they cant be vectors, as vector division is undefined. So I would throw away the vector representation and the correct one prevails.p  pI want to do this by analysing an AST. The problem is that due to the many possible combinations of types and operators, we have a combinatorial explosion.p  pAny ideas on a suitable strategy or pattern that I could use Im thinking about a type of visitor for different combinations, that run in parallel to give the best meaning to a structure. Sort of like analyzing a sentance in natural language processing.p  pIm using ANTLRs tree walking mechanism for the analysis, so any references specific to that system, or implementing semantics for a dynamic language would be much appreciated.p

Negative 92497 pThis question is a bit more specific than what the title indicates. Ive tried several methods, hoping to get the request XML to deserialize into an object, with nothing but problems.  Read on, and please just make a suggestion for some ideas for me to look into.p  pThe Problems br br I am stuck receiving a POST in HL7 format.  This is approximately a 55k post with about 200 bytes of useful info in it. I only need to extract those few bytes.  Normally, this will only be about 30 bytes, depending how many tracking numbers are sent to me.  NO, I do not have any say in changing this. br br This HL7 data is in standard XML format, with the exception that a lot of Attributes are used to carry data, instead of Elements.  Again, I seem to be stuck with the sender doing it this way.  My preference, and experience with web services, is the standard MS SoapWSDL setup.  br br I have used XSD.exe to create a class to contain the deserialized data  from some sample XML that will be sent to me. , however, XSD seems to convert all attributes to elements.  When I view the resulting WCF service page, I dont see xml that looks like what I am receiving.  This difference seems to be preventing the deserialization of the HL7 request  See the following abbreviated samples br Sample of an abbreviated inbound requestbecause dealing with the 55k sample was killing my brain, just the first few lines brp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltQUQIIN300102XXX xmlnsurnhl7orgv3 ITSVersionXML1.0gt   ltrealmCode codeXXX gt   ltid extensionXX011111 gt   ltcreationTime value201212201334240500 gt   ltresponseModeCode codeIMMEDIATE gt   ltversionCode codeV3201012 gt   ltinteractionId extensionQUQIIN300102XXX gt   ltprocessingCode codeP gt   ltprocessingModeCode codeT gt   ltacceptAckCode codeNE gt   ltreceiver typeCodeRCVgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltdevicegt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltid extensionXXXIB assigningAuthorityNameService gt     ltdevicegt   ltreceivergt   ltsender typeCodeSNDgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltdevicegt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltid assigningAuthorityNameCCC gt     ltdevicegt   ltsendergt   ltcontrolActEventgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltid extensionTracking assigningAuthorityNameTRANSTYPE gt     ltcode codeOrder gt     ltstatusCode gt     ltqueryByParametergt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltqueryId extensionNJ011111A20121220133343 gt       ltparameterListgt         ltrealmCode codeXXX gt         ltaccessionNumgt           ltvalue extensionNJ011111A gt         ltaccessionNumgt         ltbatchNumbergt           ltvalue extension120927001 assigningAuthorityNameZZ1 gt           ltvalue extension120927002 assigningAuthorityNameZZ1 gt         ltbatchNumbergt codepre  pbr br The batchNumber is the primary data I need to get from the inbound request. br If I view the WCF project service help page  created by using the WCF REST project type nuget package, if I remember correctly , I get brp  precodeltQUQIIN300102QDgt   ltrealmCodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltcodegtString contentltcodegt ltrealmCodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltcodegtString contentltcodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltrealmCodegt   ltidgt ltidgt   ltextensiongtString contentltextensiongt   ltassigningAuthorityNamegtString contentltassigningAuthorityNamegt ltidgt ltidgt   ltextensiongtString contentltextensiongt   ltassigningAuthorityNamegtString contentltassigningAuthorityNamegt ltidgt   ltidgt   ltcreationTimegt     ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltvaluegtString contentltvaluegt    ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt     ltvaluegtString contentltvaluegt    ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltcreationTimegt codepre  pbr br Now, the XML that I fed into XSD.exe does not look like what the service page hands out, and for whatever reason, when I pass in the post request, it will not deserialize. br br I hope thats enough information to describe my problem. br br What is my best choice for a solution br Create an MVC project and accept an XMLDoc as the post datatype, and do XML manipulations to get what I need Or some other option br FYI, the return data has to be inserted into the XML at some point, but I havent gotten that far yet. br br FYI, my experience with creating web services has been limited to VS.

Negative 92497 pstrongSee update belowstrongp  pI am having an issue of slow query performance when querying a very simplistic Sqlite datatable of about 500,000 rows from within a C.Net application 5sec.p  pI have tried the exact same query on exactly the same database using LinqPad, as well as 2 database browsers both based on QtSql, and it runs 10x faster 0.5secs. Same query, same db, different apps, only mine doesnt run fast.p  pIt makes negligible difference whether Im returning values or just a Count.p  pIve triedp  ul libuilding for each of .Net 3.544.5li libuilding for each of of AnyCPUx86x64li liusing each of System.Data.Sqlite, sqlitenet, as well as directly accessing a sqlite3 dll via COMli libuilding for each of WPFWinFormsli lidifferent variations of the queriesli ul  pNone of these make any noticible difference to the query time.p  pI know that rewriting the query using JOINs may help, but what I cant figure out is why the same query works fine in LinqPadSql browers but not from any app I try to create. I must be missing something pretty fundamental.p  pExample Tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE itemsid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, id1 INTEGER, id2 INTEGER, value INTEGER codepre  pExample Query String though basically any query using a subquery takes a long timep  precodeSELECT count  FROM items WHERE  id2 IN       SELECT DISTINCT id2 FROM items WHERE id1 IN               SELECT DISTINCT id1 FROM items WHERE id2  100000 AND value  10          AND value  10   AND value  10  GROUP BY id2 codepre  pI know this could probably be rewritten using JOINS and indexing to speed it up, but the fact remains that this query works significantly faster from other apps. What am I missing here as to why the same query runs so much slower no matter what I tryp  pstrongUPDATEstrong It seems the version of sqlite has something to do with the issue. Using the legacy System.Data.Sqlite v1.0.66.0 the query runs just like the other apps, however using a more recent version it is slow. I havent pinpointed what at what version exactly this changed, but am pretty sure its to do with the underlying sqlite3 version not System.Data.Sqlite specifically. If anyone knows what could have changed that would cause subqueries to slow down so much in this situation, or if there are settings or something that can make subqueries run faster in new versions of sqlite please let me knowp  pAgain, the query is an example and is not ideal and partially redundant... the question is more about why it works in one and not the other.p  pThanks in advance for any additional inputp  pstrongUPDATEstrong SOLVEDp  pSee my answer below.p

Negative 92497 pIm seeking for an advice regarding the best practice of starting java programs from shell scripts.p  pCurrently the practice within our firm seems to be having a shell script which sets all the environment variables and launches the java which is not important in this case process on background similar top  precodenohup JAVACMD gt LOGDIRLOGFILE 2gtamp1 amp codepre  pwhich is the last line of the script. We are launching single process.p  pOne doubt I have is that return code of such shell process is always 0 even for the case when the program fails to start due to some ExceptionError. This makes it hard for monitoring tools  they cant rely on the shell exit code for example.p  pI found out this can be fixed by waiting for the process to end likep  precodenohup JAVACMD gt LOGDIRLOGFILE 2gtamp1 amp wait  codepre  pBut my understanding is that this makes the last codeampcode completely useless since runningp  precodenohup JAVACMD gt LOGDIRLOGFILE 2gtamp1 codepre  pwill have the same effect.p  pSo my question is what is the best practice of launching programs from shell Does the running on background have some benefits Im overlooking p

Negative 92497 pOk this is more curiosity than practical requirement. p  pLets say I have this classp  precodepublic sealed class Entity      int value      Entity                 public static implicit operator Entityint x              return new Entity  value  x        codepre  pI dont want this class to be instantiated outside the class and this works. But here codeEntitycodes will be referenced and not copied like value types. This class being so small I want it to behave likes value types. Also if I compare two instances of codeEntitycodes like codee1  e2code its going to give reference equality ok I can overload codecode but thats more work. So I would make it a structp  precodepublic struct Entity      int value      public static implicit operator Entityint x              return new Entity  value  x        codepre  pBut now someone can do codenew Entitycode easily.p  pMy question is there a way I can have a type structclass thatp  p1 will be copied every time the value is accessed, so thatp  precodeEntity e1  1 Entity e2  e1 ReferenceEqualse1, e2  prints false, just like any value type codepre  p2 has value semantics when comparing for equality p  precodeEntity e1  1 Entity e2  1 e1.Equalse2  prints true   this is easy though by overriding default equality. codepre  p3 is not instantiable outside the scope of the typep  precodeEntity e  new Entity  should not compile codepre  pBasically close to an enums behaviour. I can certainly live without it, just learning. p

Negative 92497 pIm unclear as to what value to set for NSOpenGLPFAColorSize when creating an NSOpenGLPixelFormat. From the documentation it statesp  blockquote   pValue is a nonnegative buffer size specification. A color buffer that most closely matches the specified size is preferred. If unspecified, OpenGL chooses a color size that matches the screen.p blockquote  pBut does this mean the number of bits per pixel Or bits per component For example, if it were set 24 and interpreted as strongbits per pixelstrong then that would mean that each RGBA color would have 6bits per component for a total of 24bits for the entire RGBA pixel.p  pHowever, if it is to be interpreted as strongbits per componentstrong then that would mean 24bits for each of the red, green, blue and alpha components to make a 96bit RGBA pixel.p  pIm inclined to believe that it means strongbits per componentstrong as the values Ive seen set in sample code ranges from 8, 16, 24, 32 sand everything but 24 makes sense when interpreted as strongbits per componentstrong.s It would be nice though to have some definitive answer.p  pstrongNotestrong Edited to reflect that pixels in OpenGL are RGBA not RGB.p
Negative 92497 pI want to make an expandable list of radio groups in my android app. each element of the list should contain when opened several individual radio groups. So far I am testing with only one radiogroup per child and already I am encountering a problem I cant seem to solve by myself.p  pWhen I expand a parent of my expandable list, it seems to work properly. The radiobuttons of a radiogroup which is the only child element of a parent right now are displayed the way they should. However, when I expand another parent of my expandable list, the radio buttons are added to the already existing buttons of the other child group. Which means Once Ive expanded several child groups, each one of the expanded children contains tons of radio buttons, flooding the whole screen. Simply put, when I expand parent 1 I get the choicesp  ul liyesli linoli limaybeli ul  pWhen I expand the second parent, I get the radio choicesp  ul liyesli linoli limaybeli liyesli linoli liperhapsli liprobablyli ul  p... which are also added to the radio button group thats inside parent 1. So now I have 2 large expanded list elements. When I expand another group, the choices get added to all the child views as well, and so on, and so on...p  pSo, following simple logic it seems that all the radio buttons are not put into a new group thats newly created every time I expand a child list, but instead they are added to the same, already existing group.p  pI have been able to pretty much isolate the problem to the getChildView function inside my ExpandableListAdapter class. This is the code which causes the output described abovep  precodepublic View getChildViewint groupPosition, int childPosition, boolean isLastChild, View view,         ViewGroup parent      ExpandListChild child  ExpandListChild getChildgroupPosition, childPosition     if view  null          LayoutInflater infalInflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE         view  infalInflater.inflateR.layout.childlayout, null           ArrayListltHashMapltString,Stringgtgt inputDetailsList  child.getInputfields     RadioGroup rg  new RadioGroupview.getContext     RadioGroup rg  RadioGroup view.findViewByIdR.id.radiogroup     int hasradiogroup  0      for int i  0 i ltinputDetailsList.size i         if inputDetailsList.geti.gettype.equalsradio             hasradiogroup  1             RadioButton rb  new RadioButtonrg.getContext             rb.setTextinputDetailsList.geti.gettextcontent             rg.addViewrb                    return view  codepre  pHere is the xml file that is used as child layoutp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheight55dip androidbackgroundcolorExpandChildBackground androidorientationvertical gt  ltTextView     androidididtvChild     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextColorcolorBlack     androidtextSize17dip gt  ltRadioGroup     androidididradiogroup     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidorientationvertical     gt ltRadioGroupgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pThe line where I suspect my error could be this onep  precodeRadioGroup rg  RadioGroup view.findViewByIdR.id.radiogroup codepre  pIt looks for the radio group I created inside the inflated child layout R.layout.childlayout. But it does not use a new one for each expanded child view and instead uses an existing one to apply the buttons to. In other words, it seems like the radio group never gets the sign that its finished andor the child view never gets the sign that a new radioGroup has to be used instead of the old one.p  pWhat I have tried is creating a new RadioGroup for each child view using the following line you can see it is the commented line in the code above, instead of using the radiogroup I defined in my layout. Making a fresh radiogroup would look like thisp  precodeRadioGroup rg  new RadioGroupview.getContext codepre  pHowever, this does not work, it does not display any radio groups, let alone buttons at all. I have also tried removing the radiogroup element from the layout xmlfile because its not used anyway. Still no luck. Using simple unorganized textviews for each element seems to work properly, so this points to a problem with my radio group implementation as well.p  pHonestly, I am out of ideas right now. I might be getting the wrong context, but I have no clue what context to use. If anyone is able to point me the right direction, I would be extremely grateful. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 92497 pI have been planning to make a font changer app to ultimately put on my phone. But I am having some difficulties at the moment because some fonts just arent working. I think it could be my code actually. I may be missing something because I saw another Font changer code and it worked perfectly. So all I want to know is why arent some of these fonts working. Is there a certain method that I am suppose to call I did some research on this and found that I had to use the import java.awt.Font Which makes certain fonts work.

Negative 92497 pI need to make a server and a client to a simple chat. The server must to have threads to keep listening all clients and must send a message received to everyone. The server must have 2 threads to keep listening the socket for new messages and to read the message from keyboard and send it to the server. My problem is how to make multiple connections to the server I was thinking in use multiples sockets, one for each client, and the clients would try to connect with each port until some works, but it doesnt give error if the socket already has a connection in a port as I tough. Does someone has some tips I need to use TCP.p  pEDIT My problem isnt in the server, my problem is in the client. What I did or tried, at least, Im not sure if its right was make the main in the server create a thread to listen a socket. When there is a connection, this thread take care of that socket and the main create another thread to take care of other socket with other port. The problem is how can I detect in the client that a port is already in use and I need to connect in the socket of the next portp  pAnd sory for the bad English.p

Negative 92497 pI have a ready enterprise nonAppStore legacy iOS application for iPad that I need to refactor it was written by another developer, my predecessor on my current job.p  pThis application fetches its data via JSON from a server having MSSQL database. The database schema has about 30 tables, the most capacious are Client, City, Agency each having about 10.000 records each and the further growth is expected in the future. After the JSON is received one JSON requestandresponse pair for each table  it is mapped to the CoreData  the process which also includes glueing together the corresponding CoreData entities Client, City, Agency and others with each other i.e. setting the relations beetween these entities on the CoreData layer.p  pIn itself the projects CoreData fetchpart or readpart is heavily optimized  it uses, I guess, almost all possible performance and memory tweaks CoreData has, that is why UI layer of application is very fast and responsive, so that I consider its work as completely satisfactory and adequate.p  hr  pstrongThe problemstrong is the process of preparation of CoreData layer, i.e. the servertoclient synchronization process it takes too much time. Consider 30 network requests resulting in 30 JSON packs pack I mean one table  one JSON, which are then mapped to 30 CoreData entities, which are then glued together the appropriate CoreData relations are set beetween them. When I first saw how all this is done in this project too slow, the first idea to come into my head wasp  pFor the first time a complete synchronization is performed apps first launch time  perform a fetch of strongthe whole databasestrong data in, say, one archived file something like database dump and then somehow import it as a whole to a Core Data land.p  pBut then I realized that, even if such transmission of such onefile dump was possible, CoreData would still require me to perform a gluing of the corresponding CoreData entities to set the appropriate relations beetween them so that it is hard to imagine that I could benefit in performance if I would rely on this scheme.p  pAlso, my colleague suggested me to consider SQLite as a complete alternative to Core Data, but unfortunately I dont have an experience of using it, thats why I am completely blind to foresee all the consequences of such serious design decision even having the synchronization process very slow, my app emdoes workem, especially its UI performance is very good now. The only thing I can imagine about SQLite that in contrast to Core Data it will not push me to glue some additional relations on a client side, because SQLite has its good old foreign key system, doesnt itp  hr  pAnd so here are the questions Respondents, please do not mix these points when you answer  there is too much confusion I have about all of themp  ol lipDoes anybody have such experience of taking firsttime large import of the whole database approach in a way I have described above I would be very thankful to know about any solutions should they exploit JSONltCoreData pair or not.pli lipDoes Core Data has some global import mechanism which can allow masscreation of corresponding 30tablesschema possibly using some specific source other than 30 packs of JSON described above without a need of setting up corresponding relations for 30 entitiespli lipAre there any possibilities to speed up the synchronization process if em2em is impossible Here I mean the improvements of current JSONltCoreData scheme my app uses.pli lipMigration to SQLite should I consider such migration What I will benefit from it How the whole process of emreplicationtransmissionclient preparationsem could look like thenpli lipOther alternatives to CoreData and SQLite  what could they be or look likepli lipAny other thoughts or visions you may have about the situation Ive describedpli ol  hr  pstrongUPDATE 1strong p  pThough the answer written by Mundi is good one large JSON, No for using SQLite, I am still interested if there are any other insights into the the problem Ive described.p  hr  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI did try to use my russian english the best way I could to describe my situation in a hope for my question could become pretty clear to everyone who will read it. By this second update I will try to provide it with some more guides to make my question even more clear.p  pPlease, consider two dichotomiesp  ol liWhat canshould I use as a data layer on iOS client  CoreData vs SQLiteli liWhat canshould I use as a transport layer  JSON singleJSONatonce as suggested in the answer, even zipped maybe or some DBitselfdumps if it is even possible, of course  notice I am also asking this in my question.li ol  pI think it is pretty obvious the sector which is formed by intersection of these two dichotomies, choosing CoreData from the first one and JSON from the second is the most widespread default in iOS development world and also it is used by my app from this question.p  pHaving that said, I claim that I would be thankful to see any answers regarding CoreDataJSON pair as well as the answers considering using any other sectors what about opting SQLite and some kind of its dumps approach, why notp  pAlso, important to note, that I dont want to just drop the current option for some other alternatives, I just want to get the solution working fast on both synchronization and UI phases of its usage. So answers about improving current scheme as well as answers suggesting the other schemes are welcomep  pNow, please see the following update 3 which provides more details for my current CoreDataJSON situationp  hr  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pAs I have said, currently my app receives 30 packs of JSON  one pack for the whole table. Lets take capacious tables for example Client, Agency, City.p  pIt is Core Data, so if a codeclientcode record has nonempty codeagencyidcode field, I need to create new Core Data entity of class codeAgency NSManagedObject subclasscode and fill it with this records JSON data, thats why I need to already have corresponding Core Data entity for this agency of class codeAgency NSManagedObjects subclasscode, and finally I need to do something like codeclient.agency  agencycode and then call code[currentManagedObjectContext saveamperror]code. Having it done this way, later I can then ask this client to be fetched and ask its code.agencycode property to find corresponding entity. I hope I am completely sane when I do it this way.p  pNow imagine this pattern applied to the following situationp  pI have just received the following 3 separate JSON packs 10000 clients and 4000 cities and 6000 agencies client has one city, city has many clients client has agency, agency has many clients, agency has one city, city has many agencies.p  pNow I want to setup the following relations on Core Data level I want my client entity codeclientcode to be connected to a corresponding city and corresponding agency.p  pThe current implementation of this in the project does very ugly thing  p  ol lipSince dependency order is the following City  Agency  Client i.e. the City needs to be baked first, the application begins creating entities for City and persists them to Core Data. pli lipThen it deals with the JSON of agencies it iterates through every JSON record  for every agency, it creates a new entity codeagencycode and by its codecityidcode, it fetches corresponding entity codecitycode and connects it using the codeagency.city  citycode. After the iteration through the whole agencies JSON array is done, current managed object context is saved actually the [managedObjectContext save] is done several times, each after 500 records processed. At this step it is obvious that fetching one of 4000 cities for every client for every of 6000 agencies has a huge performance impact on the whole synchronization process. pli lipThen, finally it deals with the JSON of clients like in previous 2 stage, it iterates through the whole 10000elements JSON array and one by one performs the fetch of corresponding agencies and ZOMG cities, and this impacts the overall performance in the same manner like previous stage 2 does.pli ol  pIt is all very BAD.p  pThe only performance optimization I can see here, is that the first stage could leave a large dictionary with cities ids I mean NSNumbers of real ids and faulted City entities as values so it would be possible to prevent ugly strongfindstrong process of the following stage 2 and then do the same on the stage 3 using the analogous caching trick, but the problem is that there are much more relations beetween all the 30 tables that justdescribed [ ClientCity, ClientAgency, AgencyCity ] so the final procedure involving a caching of all the entities will the most probably hit the resources iPad device reserves for my app.p  hr  pstrongUPDATE 4strongp  pMessage for future respondents Ive tried my best to make this answer welldetailed and wellformed and I really expect you to answer with strongverbosestrong answers.

Negative 92497 pI seem to be having problems with Bootstraps carousel. The last time I implemented one was when I was using Bootstrap 2.xx. Ripping from the 2.xx example code pages worked fine. But when I do the same, the carousel does not seem to work. Doesnt slide, nothing. I have included Bootstrap 3 CDN and the paths work.

Negative 92497 pIve searched for an answer to this, but since Im fairly inexperienced I may not even know the right keywords to find relevant information. Apologies if this is redundant...p  pI have a database with several tables that have identical structure  just named differently depending on sport type i.e. MLBGames, NFLGames, and NCAAFGames. In my C class, I have logic that is applied the same way to each, only depending on which sport I happen to be working on. Is there any way to declare a single list so that I dont have to have 3 different lists, initialize the one for the sport Im working on, and have a switch statement every time in the logic that I need to work with the datap  pHeres the initialization code to help make sense of the question. It would be so much easier to just declare one List dbGames, fill it, and use that in the rest of the logic.

Negative 92497 pThis is my first question at Stack Overflow, so feel free to tell me if I do something wrong p  pIm working on a project involving EJB and JBoss 4.2.3.GA.

Also, if I call it with an existing and working IP address where a server is up and running, its OK too. p  pHowever if I call the method with a nonexisting or nonworking address or dns name, instead of throwing the NamingException, it returns the EJB in my own machine.

Negative 92497 pI have a pretty long form with about 9 or so pairs of radio buttons, bound by AngularJS. They look like thisp  precode ltinput typeradio namedidPay datangmodelmodel.didPay valueTrue gt   ltinput typeradio namedidPay datangmodelmodel.didPay valueFalse gt codepre  pBy using browser dev tools, I can see that by default model.didPay is set to  , Im guessing to keep the bound radio buttons from having an unintended default selection. If I click on an option and then manually set the value of model.didPay to     it in fact resets the selection back to their original state. So far so good.p  pMy problem is that some of the radio buttons are hidden based on previous selections, so in the best case scenario I will be posting at least 3 or so of these radio buttons as     to the server.p  pOn the server side, I have WebApi and JSON.Net doing the deserialization. While deserializing, JSON.Net throws an error p  precodeException Error reading string. Unexpected token StartObject. Path didPay, line 1, position 91.   System.Exception Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException codepre  pI was hoping that by setting the destination variable to string, JSON.Net would hopefully assign null or an empty string if it encountered  . However, this isnt the case as it correctly errors out when it encounters a new object instead of a string.p  pMy question is how are people dealing with this AngularJS radio button behavior when POSTing data Any ideas of how I can get JSON.Net to serialize that value into anything usefulp  pGlad to provide more details if need be.p  pstrongAdditional detailsstrongp  pI have a model where for example didPay is a bool property and a viewmodel where its being mapped as a string.p  precodepublic class Model      public bool DidPay  get set       rest of the props   public class ViewModel      public string DidPay  get set       rest of them props  codepre  pMy WebApi controller is taking the viewmodel as a parameter and doing the model binding magicp  precodepublic HttpResponseMessage PostViewModel data      var mappedData  Mapper.MapltViewModel, Modelgtdata      save the data      return response  codepre  pKirans suggestion gave me an idea. I changed the type of my ViewModels property to object and now it no longer complains about the deserialization. So thats one problem fixed. My current issue is mapping the JObject to a codeNullableltboolgtcode with Automapper. Im hoping thats an easy thing to configure.p

Negative 92497 pI have several PNG images with alpha transparency.  These display properly when used for general Quartz stuff such as in the UI.  However when I go to take the image and get it into OpenGL I find that the data I get has a solid alpha of 255.  I am using what seems to be the usual UIImage convert to CGImage and render into a context.  Ill post relevant bits of code below.  p  pI have done a lot of searching and finally stumbled upon a way around this and I wanted to share on here, but it is slow as it has to loop over every pixel, and copy that raw alpha into the alpha channel.  Id love to know a way around this.  I havent switched any PNG options in my build not sure where to set that to see if it helps..p  pthanksp  pFirst I get a UIImage from my app that I added like thisp  precodeUIImage image  [UIImage imageNamedimageName] codepre  pthen i convert to a CGImageRef and I do the usual context create like this relevant line onlyp  precodeCGContextRef spriteContext  CGBitmapContextCreatespriteData, width, height,                                              bitsPerComponent, bytesPerRow,                                              CGImageGetColorSpacespriteImage,                                                    kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast  kCGBitmapByteOrder32Big codepre  pThen these next two lines are the magic to get me at the REAL png raw data I probably should check the RGBA vs other formats but I am lazy  After that I draw the image, and then go back and fix up the alpha yes I know I could do this in a single loop and skipping bytes this is more readable for now...p  precode THIS data actually HAS the alpha CFDataRef data  CGDataProviderCopyDataCGImageGetDataProviderspriteImage GLubyte pixels  GLubyte CFDataGetBytePtrdata   3 CGContextDrawImagespriteContext, CGRectMake0, 0, width, height, spriteImage    Sadly we now have to loop and fix the ALPHA directly from the raw PNG source  data as otherwise we get wrongmissing alpha... for int y0 y lt height y      for int x0 x lt width x          int byteIndex  bytesPerRow  y  x  bytesPerPixel          spriteData[byteIndex  3]  pixels[byteIndex 3 ]       codepre  pthen I do the usual glTexture calls etc and it works fine..  If I leave out the copy loop above I get solid sprites with no alpha.  If I do the above, my sprites draw correctly with transparency.p  pI am aware of the whole premultiplied stuff iOS does but this seems broken  At least hopefully the above might help someone but there must be a better wayp  pThoughts  Thanksp

Negative 92497 pI have experimented with packaging my sitedeployment script in a Docker container.

To accomplish this I forward the Docker Unix socket using the codevcode option when starting the management container.p  pIs this a good or a bad idea Can I run into problems by doing this I did not read anywhere that it is discouraged, but I also did not find a lot of examples of others doing this.p

Negative 92497 pIm taking a compilers course and Im recapping the introduction. Its a general overview of how the compiler process works.p  pIm a bit confused however.p  pIn my course it states in addition a lexical analyzer will typically access the symbol table to storeget information on certain source language concepts. So this leads me to believe that a lexer will actually build a symbol table. The way I see it he creates tokens and stores the min a table and states what type of symbol it is. Like x  VARIABLE, for example.p  pThen again, when reading through Google hits and I can only seem to find vague information about the fact that the parser generates this But the parsing phase comes after the lexer phase. So Im a bit confused.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9703227symboltablepopulationafterparsingcompilerbuildingSymbol Table Population after parsing Compiler buildinga States that the parser populates the tablep  pa hrefhttpwww.cs.dartmouth.edumckeemancs48mxcomdocSymbols.html relnofollowhttpwww.cs.dartmouth.edumckeemancs48mxcomdocSymbols.htmla Says The symbol table is built by walking the syntax tree.. The syntax tree is generated by the parser, right Parse tree. So how can the lexer, which runs before the parser use this symbol tablep  pI understand that a lexer can not know the scope of a variable and other information that is contained within a symbol tabe. Therefore I understand that the parser will add this information to the table. However, a lexer does know wether a word is a variable, declaration keyword etc. Thus it should be able to build up a partial  symbol table. So could it perhaps be that they each build part of the symbol table p

Negative 92497 pI have a piece of code that does something like this p  precodeselector1.hide300 ... ... ... if selector2visible.length0    selector3.show  codepre  pHere, codeselector1code is a subset of codeselector2code. The problem I have is that the last part of the code that is attempting to make codeselector3code visible does not get past the codeifcode as codeselector2visible.lengthcode is not zero. This is because codeselector1code is still being animated. If I wait for 300ms for the animation to be completed, The code shall work fine. And I cannot use the completion callback functions  my code is too complicated for that.

GruntGruntts was setup to watch a directory for changes to code.tscode files and then compile them to code.jscode. All the project files including the local npm modules are stored on dropbox and each computer I develop on also has codegruntclicode installed globally. Everything was working great for a couple weeks and then last week I saw that Typescript 1.0RC was available so I attempted to change the codegrunttscode dependency from 0.9.5 to 1.0 to see if it would work. Well it didnt so I uninstalled codegrunttscode and reinstalled it. It still works fine on 2 of my 3 PCs but for some reason my main one the one where I initiated the changes will not successfully watch the directory and recompile anymore. I have uninstalled node, removed the npm modules directories I could find one where node was installed and then 2 under appdataroaming  one of which was a cache folder and then reinstalled only the things I have on the other PCs, but it didnt make a bit of difference. The most annoying part is that there are no errors it just simply sits there after the initial compile that happens when I run codegruntcode from the project folder...never updating on file changes...If I run codegruntcode on another pc and make file changes, once dropbox syncs that PC watches and compiles fine.p  pAside from trying to find somewhere where some old npmnode info is cached, I am out of ideas on what to try...p  pEven though it shouldnt matter since it works on other PCs via dropbox, here is the gruntfilep  precodemodule.exports  function grunt      use strict      grunt.initConfig         ts              options                  target es5,                 module amd,                 sourcemap true,                 declaration false,                 nolib false,                 comments false             ,             dev                  src [src.ts],                 watch src,                 outDir src                      ,           load the task     grunt.loadNpmTasksgruntts     grunt.registerTaskdefault, [tsdev]  codepre  pPackage.jsonp  precode   devDependencies      grunt 0.4.1,     gruntts 1.7.22,     typescript 0.9.5     codepre

Negative 92497 pI have an applications that is required to listen to ADT and ORU messages.  These message types could both be received on a single channel and post processed as appropriate.  Alternatively, they could be received on separate queues and processed separately.  I am using Camelmina for the MLLP channels.  What is the conventional approach to this type of application  I have been trying to consider the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.  I guess if they were separate, I could run separate applications that persist the data in a common data store.  This may simplify development and be a more SOA approach  but that is the only advantage I can think of. p

From there we would copy from alpha to beta, then from beta to production. So there is not a unique build for each environment. The way were handling environmentspecific settings right now is there is one config file that has all the settings for each environment Lets call this EnvironmentSpecificSettings.config Ill refer to it below. There is a static file on each server that indicates which environment the server should be in, and so when that config file is read in, the matching settings can be applied.p  pThe problemp  pThe ADFS configuration is handled in the web.config. There are a few things that are specific to the environment. How might I handle this within my current deployment paradigm I had a couple of ideasp  ol liinclude a file reference in the web.config that reads in a static environmentspecific file that would not be part of the deployment.li liTry to pull something off in ApplicationStart that would read in settings from EnvironmentSpecificSettings.config mentioned above and alter the web.config.li liTry to tweak the configuration of the WSFederationAuthenticationModule at runtimeli ol  pthe first idea 1 is less than optimal because it requires files hanging around outside of source control and outside of deployments, however it should work easily enough. Next, 2 I kinda think isnt possible. Im not sure you can change your web.config like I am hoping, but maybe Finally, 3 Is only reasonable because Im in a special situation where Im not doing regular passive authentication, instead Im manually redirecting to adfs, so I have a chance to change settings, such as injecting the whr parameter to avoid HRD. So, it might be possible, however, Im not sure how or if you can change some of these values on the fly such as thumbprint, or wsFederation issuer or realm.p  pDoes anyone have any better ideas or experience in handling environmentspecific settings without doing the visual studio web deploys with transformsp
Negative 92497 pI read the paper of Viola and Jones.  They stated clearly in the paper that their algorithm is faster than others because calculation of image pyramid is avoided by scaling feature rectangles.p  pBut I googled around for a long time, only to find that OpenCV implements the image pyramid method instead of scaling the feature rectangles. And integral image is computed for all sub images in the pyramid. And this is done for every frame if this algorithm is used to process video in stead of picture.p  pWhats the rationale of this choice I dont quite get it.p  pAll I can understand is completely the opposite for video applications, scaling the features only needs to be done once, and the scaled features can be reused by all the frames. And only the integral image of the whole image needs to be computed .p  pAm I correct on thisp  pViola and Jones also presented a 15fps frame rate on a Pentium 3 computer, but I hardly see anybody achieving that performance with the OpenCV implementation on modern computer. Thats strange, isnt itp  pAny input will be helpful. Thank you.p

Negative 92497 pI am trying to wrap my head around the high level concepts and Im just starting to learn Spring Security at the same time.  While eventually I want to support Login via Google and other social media, for now I am just prototyping so all I want is a quick way to add user support to my app for testing purposes.p  pI am using Spring Boot and Backbone.  After the initial page load, all requests are made via REST through Backbone.

I just get a code403  Forbiddencode.p  pI think I understand why this is happening at a highlevel.  I assume I need to send user details with every request to the server.  But Im not sure how that works with Spring Security and I cant find any documentation to explain it.   p  pI would rather follow Spring Security guidelines here rather than attempt to roll my own solution and reinvent the wheel.  p  pIs there a idiomatic way to do this in Spring Security  p

Negative 92497 pI am working on a Recurrent Neural Network in C using the Qt library. It gets constructed with a vector containing the topology where the number of elements define the number of layers and each element specifies the number of neurons in each layer.p  pThe problem at hand is that the class needs to store some weights in matrices which depend on the size of the elements as well as their number is depended on the size of the vector. Required is a fast and efficient, index based access, 3 dimensional of which one dimension differs in size container. It does not necessarily be able to be resizable but AFAIK it can not be preallocated bevor the constructor, since size and number is given with the constructor.p  ol lipI tried to store them in a nested vector but except from problems how to work with that I already read that nested vectors do not have a good performance, e.g.p  ptypedef QVector lt QVector lt QVector lt double   Weightspli lipI read something about Dynamically Allocated MultiDimensional Arrays using arrays of pointer pointing to arrays of pointers pointing to ... and so on. This did not look very elegant.pli lipQt also provides some Matrix classes but since I can not preallocate them I neglected those.pli lipTaking some additional library like a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1440libsmultiarraydocindex.html relnofollowBoosta.pli lipAnother solution might be writing some class or custom container for my needs but I would rather not unless this is really the best way to do it.pli ol  pSo I am asking for advise what is the way to go here Is there even a possibility to preallocate the memory or does it need to be dynamic p  pDisclaimer I am aware that there are a lot of similar questions around but they seem to lack comparing possibilities also I am not always sure if the underlying situation is the same.p

Negative 92497 pI have an Android application that needs to access data from different screens.  The main problem is, each one needs to be able to modify the data, and there is quite a bit of it  3 million integers divided among six arrays.p  pThe options that I can think of arep  ol lipPut each screen in a separate view, and use a ViewAnimator as the topmost layout, switching between the child views as necessary this way, the arrays are defined in the main activity and are accessible both reading and writing by all of the screens.pli lipPut each screen in its own Activity, and pass the data from one screen to another by putting it into a Bundle that is included in the startActivityForResult call and any changes would be passed back through the returned Intents Extras in onActivityResult.  The problem with this is, the data has to be copied quite a few times, which, it seems to be, involves quite a bit of overhead in terms of both time and memory.pli lipCreate a Class to hold the data create a variable of that Class in the main activity, and pass that variable back and forth  but is the variable itself being passed to the second activity, or a copy of it so any changes would then not be reflected in the variable in the main activitypli ol  pIs there a preferred method for a situation like this  Am I leaving something outp
Negative 92497 pWere am building a SharePoint 2013 site not sure if SharePoint is affecting it or not with which I am using jQuery, jQueryui, requireJS and angular.p  pWeve got require and angular to play nicely together, loading in the required js filescontrollers as and when they are needed.p  pHowever, we are having issues with jQueryui.. Ever so often 1 in 10 approximately, it fails to load properly. The page has fully loaded, and the jquery and jquery UI files are listed under sources, yet no UI functions work.p  pFor example, my calendar controls error when loading, with emundefined is not a functionem. I can type   strongdatepicker.datepickerstrong in the console window, and I get emundefinedem back. When jQuery UI does successfully load, I get the expected result in the console window..p  pI have tried loading the jQuery and jQuery UI files directly at the top of the page, and not via require, but this fails to work to resolve the issue..p  pCan anyone suggest what may be going wrong here pleasep  pThanks Dannyp

Negative 92497 pIf I issue an update to mongodb with a read preference of MongoClientRPSECONDARY is it possible for my update operation to read an out of date record for determining which records to updatep  pTo be clear Im basically asking is update considered a write operation and therefore follows Secondardy  A replica set member that replicates the contents of the master database. Secondary members may handle read requests, but only the primary members can handle write operations. See Secondariesp  pSo if mongo decides to split the operation into two separate components, the query portion to locate the records to update and the write portion, the read COULD read out of date data from a secondary.p

Negative 92497 pI have a series of rather complex D3 directives that are all embedded in a single view in angular. Originally each one lived on a separate view with lots of other content and in that context each performs exactly as intended. It was decided that we should aggregate these data interactive components into a single view location for easier access, and since each directive is an isolate scope returning a link function that contains all the logic with no reference to the parent scope of the view controller, I assumed it would be as easy as thisp  precodelteaagaugedatainteractiverechargegtlteaagaugedatainteractiverechargegt lteaagaugedatainteractivewellsgtlteaagaugedatainteractivewellsgt lteaagaugedatainteractivespringsgtlteaagaugedatainteractivespringsgt codepre  pHowever, when I do that only the first directive seems to be receiving all the mouse events even when it is hidden and off screen while the others are visible and on screen.p  pThe directive definition object is essentially identical in eachp  precodevar directiveDefinitionObject     compile false,   controller false,   controllerAs false,   link false,   priority 0,   require false,   restrict E,   scope ,   template false,   templateUrl false,   terminal false,   transclude false,   type false  codepre  pSince there is no parent controller reference, an isolate scope is defined, and the directives are never onscreen at the same time and so there is no invisible overlapping of the interactive portions I do not understand why only the first operates correctly.p  pFor clarity, here is one of the link functions they are roughly equivalent in structure.

Negative 92497 pEclipse supports conditional breakpoints which break at a particular line when the condition is true.p  pIt also supports watchpoints which break immediately when a given variable is accessedmodified, regardless of the line that caused the modification.p  pHow would I create a conditional watchpoint such that it breaks at whichever line a given variable is modified AND the condition is truep  pFor example set a MODIFY watchpoint on a variable X so that it only breaks when X is set to a value  1000p  pEDIT Say a field can be changed from many different methods, potentially in different packages. One could conceivably create a conditional breakpoint at each of these locations to break when the condition is true.  However, the number of places this variable is touched can be numerous and placing that make breakpoints is rather inefficient from a human standpoint.  An alternative is watchpoints which automatically breaks any time the field is modified, regardless of where it was modified from in code.  However, I dont know of a way to only have watchpoints break when a condition is met.p

Negative 92497 pbecause of my assignment to recreate an application as much as possible, I cannot change the spinner item order unless what Im about to ask is impossible in Android. p  pI populate the spinner using values from a String[].

Negative 92497 pI have a hyperlink that when clicked will render a popup form. However before the popup renders I want to validate some data first. So in this case, if the client name already exists, do not render the popup to create a new client with that name.

If the validation passes, then document.location.href  popupUrl would render the popup, otherwise if the validation fails the error message  errorMessageClientName.show  is displayed instead. However event.preventDefault does not work, the popup is rendered. It should be noted that validateClientName is a callback function, and that might be part of the problem. Setting the event in a global variable and attempting event.stopPropagation in the callback function does not work. The datatogglemodal attribute in the hyperlink is a bootstrap feature that renders a modal popup when the hyperlink is clicked.p  pSo how do I fix thisp

Negative 92497 pI have a rather strange behaviour in an app that is monitoring some CLCircularRegion objects.p  pstrongWhat the app is expected to dostrongp  pWhenever a region is entered or left, an entry in a quite simple UIManagedDocument not located in the iCloud will be updated or created. Furthermore, a NSLocalNotification will be fired telling me which region has been affected and how long the user stayd within the region.p  pstrongWhat really happensstrongp  pThe Notifications are fired as expected, so the delegate methods are fired. Even the duration is calculated correctly. BUT, whenever the app was in background for a longer time  what means about an hour or more  there are no objects updated or created in the UIManagedDocument. This behaviour is hard to debug, because I cannot reproduce it with the debugger attached or in Simulator, just on my iPhone 5S running iOS 8.1.3.p  pstrongWhat I already tried outstrongp  pEven if the UIManagedDocument handles context saving by itself, I tried to call the context saving directly from the location managers delegate method. Without any success. Turning on the location update background capability lead the app to be rejected from the app store, because there is no need to do background location updates when working with region monitoring.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pDoes anyone out there face similar problems or knows how to do the trickp  pthank you in advance, Peterp

Negative 92497 pSo I have a c ATL COM component, which calls my C component that exposes a COM visible interface.The ATL COM component passes an Interface pointer to my C component so my c code can call back into the ATL object. the ATL component is used in a windows forms app. p  pOK so, in order to do its work, the c component needs to spin a thread and watch for things to happen.p  pHere is my question.  Can I safely access, in managed code background thread an object that is a an interface pointer to an  STA objectp  pin c classic COM, you need to marshal and unmarshal the interface. do i need to do that in managed code if so howp

I am using a MVC patter which in terms mean that I have 3 different abstractions, M stands for the Model abstraction which holds all seperate classes relating to the application, V stands for the View abstraction which is only going to have the code which the user can see and calls from user interaction. C stands for the Controller abstraction which gets calls from user interractions from the View and further distributes them to the right Class in the Model. p  pNow In my case I have a GUI that is created in a EDT in the View abstraction and the above SQLConituousloopfethconnectionclassthing is in the Modelofcourse.

Negative 92497 pThe way I understand it, is if I have an animation thats 30 seconds long and is also a loop, through Cycle Offset I can make this animation start at a time different than second 0. So I could make it start at second 10, go to 30, then back to 0, to 30 and keep looping that way. I have a Game Object, an Animation Controller and an Animation Clip. I set a whole bunch of different values for the Cycle Offset of the Animation by selecting it in the Project Folder and then updated its settings in the Inspector and it does nothing, the animation still starts at second 0 every time, regardless of what value I write in.p  pNot sure if this helps at all, but I also duplicated my Game Object, Animation Controller and Animation Clip so I actually have 2 of each. I did however, go to my Animator window, to make sure the default state for each Animation Controller is different and it is. I also checked that each object has a different Animation Controller. I honestly dont even think this part matters that much, because even if these were wrong, the animation would at least start from a later point on both game objects when changing the Cycle Offset. What happens though, is basically nothing, the animation just starts from second 0, goes to 30 and loops every time.p  pWhat am I missing Thanks in advancep

Negative 92497 pIm using spritekit in Swift and setting up textures using the codeSKTexturerectinTexturecode function.

Negative 92497 pNote that by widget this excludes canvas items which arent widgets.p  pMy goal is to build two classes one that produces items of a canvas widget, the other producing widgets themselves. This is to ensure I can move stuff around in the window and keep it there upon reopening. Ive already done this for canvas items. You see, canvas widgets actually return an actual ID that remains constant for the respected items, thus I can reference that and its coords.p  pHowever, for widgets themselves, there seems to be no such way of obtaining an ID. Ive tried codewidget.getintcode, codewidget.getvarcode , etc. Ive also tried  codereprwidgetcode and codeidwidgetcode, but embothem of these values change upon reopening, am thinking that new widgets are created, where the variable just refers to a newly created widget in comparison to the one just destroyed, even if it has identical properties.p  pIve also tried putting said widgets in a parent window, like window, or frame, but these widgets themselves do not assign any unique values to their respective child widgets.p  pSo basically, I can obtain unique values of any given widget, but none that are constant. This could by emanyem value by the way, for I shall just turn it to a string, append it to a dict, and assign the coords to said str to reference a specific widget.p  pThank you in advance for any guidance, it is much appreciated p

Negative 92497 pIm adding quiescence search to my chess engine using alphabeta prunning with transposition tables called inside MTDf algorithm.  In my main search, after reaching depth0 leaf node I call Quiescence search that is implemented as simple alpha beta prunning without transposition table because tests showed that searching only captures works faster without TTp  pI noticed something that is not covered in pseudo codes on this topic When Im at depth0 leaf in main search and I call quiescence search function to obtain node evaluation, I think I should obtain type of evaluation too exact, alpha or betap  precode... beginning of main alphabeta search, checking node in TT if depth  0       calling quiescence search with current alpha beta     int qresult  QuiescenceAlphaBetaSearchnode, alpha, beta     saveInTTnode, qresult.Type, qresult.Value   else      ... run alpha beta search of node.children  codepre  pIn typical examples leafnode evaluation is stored in TT always as exact value, but when node evaluation is based on alpha beta search through captures and this search starts with alphabeta boundaries that are not inf,inf, I think the result of QuiescenceAlphaBetaSearch will not be always exact value and if its stored in TT it should be marked with flag returned from quiescence search, am I correctp  pIm not really sure if passing current alpha and beta from main search to Quiescence search is mathematically correct, so I would appreciate confirmation on this topic too.p

Negative 92497 pI need to figure out how to delete this chart because when I create a new one in the same spot, the previous one still shows through. The user originally selects something from a dropdown. Based on that the js does a codehttp.getcode request to a url. Then it creates a chart with that data, and refreshes the chart every x seconds. When a user selects something different from the dropdown, it does the same process, but for some reason I cant seem to destroy the old chart. You can see I tried to attempt so  codescope.myChart.destroycode but at that point it says that my chart isnt defined.p  pIt makes sense because when a new item is selected in the dropdown, it basically calls all of this over again from the beginning.

Basically the only difference is that the second layer of columns should not resize like they do right now.

It should stay fixed, and appear with the same width he has when the animation is complete. p  pThe technique I used doesnt seem to allow that.

Negative 92497 pI am currently working on a webpage. I wanted to add a background to the title that would resize with the size of the browser window.

Negative 92497 pIm trying to perform a somewhat complex copy operation for a series of referential rows in a set of poorlynormalized hierarchical tables. Unfortunately, these tables use surrogate keys, but there are instances in the hierarchy where some tables have a surrogate key but no valid uniqueness properties within the table. Therefore, as I insert my copied rows in each hierarchical table, there are cases when I cannot avoid duplicate records because there is no way for me to correctly differentiate what are effectively duplicate rows. Sadly, I cannot change the structure of this database.p  pThe technique Im using is to INSERT based on the results of a SELECT statement, where each row in the select joins together rows that form a hierarchy of source entities from this join result, copied content is taken and inserted into rows that represent the destination hierarchy. In the join statement, the surrogate key ids are used. For examplep  precodeINSERT INTO [PersonTable] SELECT [sourcePerson].[Content], [destParent].[Id] FROM [GrandParentTable] [sourceGrandParent] JOIN [ParentTable] [sourceParent] ON [sourceParent].[GrandParentId]  [sourceGrandParent].[Id] JOIN [PersonTable] [sourcePerson] ON [sourcePerson].[ParentId]  [sourceParent].[Id] JOIN [GrandParentTable] [destGrandParent] ON [destGrandParent].[Name]  CopyTo JOIN [ParentTable] [destParent] ON [destParent].[GrandParentId]  [destGrandParent].[Id] WHERE [sourceGrandParent].[Name]  CopyFrom codepre  pMy problem is that this hypothetical table, [PersonTable], does not have sufficient columns or constraints to uniquely identify rows within it, so if I wanted to subsequently copy rows from another table [ChildTable], I would get duplicate rows when executing a subsequent queryp  precodeINSERT INTO [ChildTable] SELECT [sourceChild].[Content], [destPerson].[Id] FROM [GrandParentTable] [sourceGrandParent] JOIN [ParentTable] [sourceParent] ON [sourceParent].[GrandParentId]  [sourceGrandParent].[Id] JOIN [PersonTable] [sourcePerson] ON [sourcePerson].[ParentId]  [sourceParent].[Id] JOIN [ChildTable] [sourceChild] ON [sourceChild].[PersonId]  [sourcePerson].[Id] JOIN [GrandParentTable] [destGrandParent] ON [destGrandParent].[Name]  CopyTo JOIN [ParentTable] [destParent] ON [destParent].[GrandParentId]  [destGrandParent].[Id] JOIN [PersonTable] [destPerson] ON [destPerson].[ParentId]  [destParent].[Id] WHERE [sourceGrandParent].[Name]  CopyFrom codepre  pOne way I had hoped to get around this was to somehow correlate the copied row ids with the source Ids, and store them in temp tables that could replace these joins. I wanted to use the OUTPUT clause for this, so that I could grab the inserted rows [Id] value, but even though it seems sensible that you should be able to output anything from the joined tables, this isnt the case.p  pAssume for this next example that there already exists a table that weve filled with valid ID pairsp  precodeCREATE TABLE tempParentIds      [destParentId] int     [sourceParentId] int  codepre  pWe attempt to fill the next level down in the hierarchy with the following statementp  precodeCREATE TABLE tempPersonIds      [destPersonId] int     [sourcePersonId] int  INSERT INTO [PersonTable] [Content], [ParentId] OUTPUT INSERTED.[Id], [sourcePerson].[Id] INTO tempPersonIds SELECT [sourcePerson].[Content], [destPerson].[ParentId] FROM tempParentIds [tempParent] JOIN [PersonTable] [sourcePerson] ON [sourcePerson].[ParentID]  [tempParent].[sourceParentId] JOIN [PersonTable] [destPerson] ON [destPerson].[ParentId]  [tempParent].[destParentId] codepre  pHowever, this statement will not execute because [sourcePerson] isnt accessible in the OUTPUT clause, and thus we have no way of keeping track of the source row and the destination row that was copied from it.p  pIs there a way to obtain information from an inserted row in addition to information from outside the inserted rows columns If this is possible Id love to know how, but if Im going about this the wrong way based on the description of my problem please feel free to set me straight, too.p

Negative 92497 pIm building an Android app that requires me to send messages to another device via Bluetooth every minute while the phone is sleeping.p  pThis requires me to register a receiver that listens for the Intent.ACTIONTIMETICK intent when the app calls onStop and unregister it when the app calls either onRestart or onDestroy.p  pThis worked when my phone was on Android Kitkat, but now that Ive updated the OS to Lollipop, Intent.ACTIONTIMETICK does not seem to be broadcasted every minute anymore. In other words, Intent.ACTIONTIMETICK is not consistently issued by the system while the phone is sleeping during Android Lollipop even though it did work for Kitkat. Therefore, my broadcast receiver listening for this intent is triggered at weird times sometimes never triggered, sometimes triggered in the middle of a minute.p  pIs this purposeful or is this an Android bug in the Lollipop OS Is this in any way related to the fact that the AlarmManager API also does not have exact time deliveries from API 19 now due to the new batch policy that minimizes battery use by batching alarms together a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappAlarmManager.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappAlarmManager.htmlap  pstrongMost importantly, is there any way around this so that I can still receive updates when the time has changed Note I do not want to use the AlarmManager API.strongp  pThanks in advance All help is appreciated.p

Negative 92497 pI am attempting to dockerize a GUI app and have had some success. If I build the dockerfile into an image and then perform a codedocker run name testcontainer testimagecode it appears that the process begins but the abruptly stops. I then check the container with codedocker pscode to confirm no containers are running. Then I check codedocker ps acode and can see that it exited with status code codeexit0code. Then if I run the command codedocker start testcontainercode, it appears to start the codeENTRYPOINTcode command again, but this time it is able to continue and the GUI pops up. p  pMy best guess is that I think that when I run the codedocker runcode command, the process begins but might be forked into a background process, causing the container to exit since the foreground process has ended. Although that could be way off because you would think the codedocker startcode command would result in the same outcome. I was thinking of trying to force the process to stay in the foreground, but do not know how to do that. Any suggestionsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I editted my Dockerfile to use supervisord to manage the starting of the GUI app. Now my docker run command will start supervisor, which will start my GUI app, and it works. Some things to note about this are that supervisor showsbr codeINFO spawned myguiapp with pid 7codebr codeINFO success myguiapp entered RUNNING statecodebr codeINFO exited myguiapp exit status 0 expectedcodebr Supervisor and the container are still running at this point, which seems to indicate that the main process kicks off a child process. Since supervisor is still running, my container stays up and the GUI app does show up and I can use it. When I close the GUI, supervisor reportsbr codeCRIT reaped unknown pid 93codebr Supervisor remains running, causing the container NOT to close. So I have to CTRLC to kill supervisor. Id rather not use supervisor, but if I need to, I would like for supervisor to close itself gracefully when that child process ends. If I could figure out how to get my container or supervisor to track child processes of the main process, then I think this would be solved.p

Negative 92497 pWe have a strange problem with our Android app. In Fabric we have a very infrequent crash. It is a standard UnsatisfiedLinkError meaning that in the static initializer of the Java class, the .so library fails to load. This is what we have found out so farp  ul lipThe problem is very rare. It happens in a couple of hundred devices out of hundreds of thousands or of installations.pli lipOnce it happens, it seems like restarting or even reinstallationdoes not solve it.pli lipIt happens across various brands like Sony, Samsung, Huawei.pli lipIt happens across all Android versions from 2.3 to 5.x.pli lipWe managed to catch it once in the office on a Nexus 1 device. When it started to happen, it always failed in the LoadLibrary call even though the same apk worked just fine on other devices.pli lipWhen the problem happened, I removed the armv7a and x86 versions of the lib and only left the armeabi one to rule out the wrong lib was loaded, it still failed. Rerunning the app through Android studio several times adding logs still caused the failure in the same place.pli lipThen all of a sudden, without no obvious change, it started to work in the Nexus 1 and even after dozens of retries, we can not reproduce the problem again. The only thing that happened before it started to work was that I tried to manually install a corrupt apk with adb install which failed and the next time I loaded the app through Android studio, it worked and has worked even since. I am not sure if the failed installation of the corrupt apk somehow cleaned something out or if it was just a coincidence.pli lipThe thing I failed to do was to check that the armeabi .so file was actually present in the lib folder on the device when the failure occurred. I only came to think about this after it had already started to work.pli ul  pSo, to sum up. The apk is perfectly fine but and installs fine from Android studio the Play store on 99,9 of the devices but then under certain conditions which are very rare, the LoadLibrary fails and when it does, there seems to be no obvious fix, not even reinstalling solved it but as I explained, something finally changed and when it started working on the Nexus 1, it has continued to work ever since.p  pThis problem is really tricky since we have no way of reproduce it right now and we know it is affecting at least a small group of our users.p  pAny suggestions on how to narrow this down are welcome.p
