Positive 104797 pI have an UITabBarController that has 3 UINavigationController within. What I am trying to do, is on the push of a button on the UINavigationControllers bar, to drop the bar all the way down to right above the UITabBarControllers bar. I am doing this so that I can display in a pull down fashion, more content that would fill in the area above the now lowered UINavigationBar and then go away when it is moved up. So, in essence, I want to move around the UINavigationBar of a UINavigationController. I will only need this slideup down behavior of the UINavigationBar in the root view controllers of the respective UINavigationControllers of each tab. I have tried to just reposition the bar on the UINavigation controller like so...p  precode IBAction func moveBarDownsender AnyObject       self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame  CGRectx 100, y 500, width 100, height 100        note that I just used bogus values for demonstration purposes. codepre  pHowever, I get something like this...p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png altenter image description hereap  pAs you can see, the navigation bar extends all the way to the top even though it only has a height of 100. This leads me to believe that I am not supposed to resize and move around the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController and move it around. So, was thinking and researching some other ways of getting this same functionality. p  p1 Fake it I was thinking that I could just programmatically insert an identical but fake navigation bar not connected to a UINavigationController, hide the real UINavigationBar attached to the navigation controller, and then move the fake one around as needed. Then, on the slide up, I could move fake navigation bar back up, unhide the real one, and then delete the fake navigation bar.p  p2 Implement my own sort of navigation controller I was reading that I could use a container view to implement my own navigation controller. I am not familiar with doing such a thing, and dont even know if implementing my own UINavigationController would be a good thing to do.p  pSo, my question is, how would I achieve the desired functionality of moving the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController Is there some way that I am totally missing Any comments, suggestions, or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 104797 pI am developing an ASP.NET web application that incorporates google maps. I have an ASP.NET listbox on my page which contains a list of items. When the user selects one of the items, Id like to show this item on the map. The main complication lies in the fact that google maps uses javascript to control it and the listbox is a server control.p  pI can think of two ways to do this. The first would involve the listbox calling a javascript function when the user selects a new item. I can then write this function to perform the necessary map operations. Unfortunately, the OnSelectedIndexChanged property of the listbox doesnt seem to support javascript functions.p  pThe second involves wrapping an UpdatePanel around the listbox and getting the listbox to perform a postback. In the SelectedIndexChanged event in VBC, I would the need to somehow make a call to a javascript function which would then update the map.p  pWhich solution can I usep  pThanksp  pAmrp

These applications will need to be able to query information from the internet query via Google, grab feeds from our other sites, just general web access and save files to their computer.p  pThe reason I want to host the application is so that it all can be centrally managed, and any updates would be instantly deployed to everyone that uses the service. There always seems to be headaches with developing a pure desktop app in a language like C with regards to making sure people use the latest version, dont have some odd problem with the installer, etc.p  pSince we dont want to tie up our servers CPU I want effectively all of the processing done clientside. Meaning that they would log into their account, access the app, and then all the work done within the app is all handled by their machine. Only specific data would be sent back to the server.p  pstrongSo  which language is best for this Microsofts Silverlight, Adobes Flash, or Suns JavaScriptstrong Ive heard a lot of good things about Silverlight and have wanted to try it for some time.

Negative 104797 pI am working in an Agile environment and things have gone to the state where the client feels that they would prefer Waterfall due to the failures thats what they think of the current Agile scenario. The reason that made them think like this would be the immense amount of design level changes that happened during the end stages of the sprints which we developers could not complete within the time they specified. p  pAs usual, we both were blaming each other. From our perspective, the changes said at the end were too many and designcode alterations were too much. Whereas from the clients perspective, they complain that we developers are not understanding the requirements fully and coming up with solutions that were not what they intended in the requirement. like they have asked us to draw a tiger, and we drew a cat.p  pSo, the client felt not us that Agile process is not correct and they want to switch to a Waterfall mode which IMHO would be disastrous. The simple reason being their satisfaction levels in a Agile mode itself were not enough, then how are they going to tolerate the output after spending so much time during the design phase of a Waterfall developmentp  pPlease give your suggestions.p

Negative 104797 pI have an app where the appDelegate has a UITabBarController.  Each of the tabs has a navigation controller which I currently use to push a single detail view onto the stack in each tab.  I am hoping to replace my navigation controller on each of the tabs with a splitViewController.  I use the Interface builder to provide the UINavigationController for each tab.  I am having trouble loading a nib for each tab that has a UISplitViewController in it.  I am getting an instance of the UITableViewController class displaying on the screen, but I am not getting the UISplitviewController or the Popover or the detail view etc.  These classes are all working in a standalone app, but I am not able to get them into each of the tabs in one app.  Although I am currently using the Interface Builder I am open to doing this programmatically. If someone has suggestions, or an example small project of a Tab based app with individual split views in the tabs I would appreciate it very much.  As this is my first question I am not sure how much code or other pictures from IB would be helpful for me to post.  If you need further detail please let me know and I would gladly amend this post.p

Negative 104797 pfolks. Ive created a setup project in VS2008 which installs fine by itself. However projects being installed by this installer depend on components mainly speaking ESRI which must also be installed on target machines. There is a separate installer for ESRI that we have and it consists of msi srcipt as well as 6 folders with subfolders in those which are user by this msi. I cant seem to figure out how to include that into my setup project, so that target users just run one full package. I tried the following which emalmostem works 1.Created one more class library project in the solution 2.Added installer class to it 3.Overrode Install method and wrote p  precodestring pathAssembly.GetExecutingAssembly.Location Process.StartPath.Combinepath, esriinstaller.msi codepre  p4.Added msi file to output folders pane in installer project This does not quite work bc apath doesnt point to directory where the installer was launched in fact I tried various combinations of Assembly.Get....BasePath methods  these yield either WindowsSystem32 or target folder bI also have to manually copy all ESRI folders into installers package dir ...binRelease p  pSo, is there a literate way to add that package to my installer I configured .NET dependencies in Detected Dependencies properties dialog box to install those from full dotnetfix included in the package and it worked fine, and I thought may be I could somehow force installer to think that ESRI is also dependendent on project, but with no results yet. Any suggestionsp  pNow, we also need to automate some installer packages like SqlServer2008 to minimize user interraction.  In fact, we would like to supress some dialogs from installer do not offer to use SoftIce  we are not hackers, unfortunetly. A friend of mine has pointed to some AutoIt project.  Is that itp

Negative 104797 pIm fumbling around a bit with WebSockets, and was pretty pleased with how easy it was to get a Tornado server running that does basic websocket connections. Ive never used Tornado before today, and while I like what Ive seen theres a few questions that I have regarding its use.p  pPrimarily, Im using WebSockets so that I can have lowoverhead communications between two or more client machines. For the purposes of conversation lets just say its a chat client Obviously I can connect into the server from multiple machines, and they can all push messages to the server and the server can respond, which is great But thats not too much better than your standard AJAX requests. If I have a persistent connection I want to be able to push data to the clients as well. The simplest possible scenario is user 1 posts a message to the server and upon receiving it the server immediately pushes it to user 2.p  pSo what would be a good way to accomplish that As far as I can see in Tornado theres no way to communicate between connections other than placing the message in a datastore somewhere and having all the other connections poll for new info. That strikes me as terribly clunky though, because all youre really doing at that point is moving the polling process from the client to the server.p  pOf course, I may be barking up the wrong tree entirely here. Its certainly plausible that Tornado simply isnt the right tool for this job, and if thats the case Id be happy to hear suggestions for alternativesp
Negative 104797 pI have a long running process that I suspect has a memory leak.  I use codetopcode to monitor the memory levels of each process and nothing uses more than 15 of the total RAM.  The machine has 4GB of RAM and the process starts with well over 3GB free.  The process itself does very heavy, custom calculations on several MB of data.  It takes a single core at 100.p  pAs time goes on, memory disappears but codetopcode does not blame my long running process.  Instead, the cached and buffers memory increases and the free memory is reduced to as low as 2MB.  The process eventually finishes its job and exits without issue but the memory never comes back.  Should I be concerned or is this normal  Are there other tools besides codetopcode that can provide a deeper understandingp  pThanks.p

Negative 104797 pIve created a UIWebView for logging into Facebooks Graph API OAuth interface. This works great, but I have to tap the first input field in order for the keyboard to pop up. Ideally, the keyboard would appear as soon as the form appears. So Ive been trying to figure out how to make the first form field get the focus from the codewebViewDidFinishLoadcode UIWebViewDelegate method, like sop  precode voidwebViewDidFinishLoadUIWebView wv      [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringdocument.getElementsByNameemail[0].focus]  codepre  pAlas, this does not work. Curiously, when I run that JavaScript in the Firefox JavaScript console, it does move the focus to the email field. When I run it in Safari for the Mac, however, it does nothing, just like on iOS. FWIW, codealertdocument.getElementsByNameemail[0]code emdoesem show that it selects an HTMLInputElement. So why does codefocuscode do nothing either in iOS or Mac OS Xp

Negative 104797 pIm just curious about this, as its probably too much trouble to be worth it for me. Im wondering how its possible to have each file of a custom type have a different, descriptive icon in windows explorer. A classic example it Photoshops .psd files. Windows doesnt natively have a clue what a psd is I assume, but somehow, when browsing in Windows, the file icon is a thumbnail of the psd itself.p  pHow is this done Im curious both from a programming perspective and OS perspective. For example, when Windows sees .psd, what does it do to get the thumbnail Does Adobe install some separate utility in a magic location that Windows uses to generate the thumbnail for the filep

Negative 104797 pFirst of all, apologies for not being able to supply any sourcecode. My project is pretty big and linking everything would be impractical, and I have not been able to scale down the problem which is exceedingly annoying. I will do my best to explain it here.p  pI am dynamically creating new instances of a class on each loop in my code. This instance is dynamically given a couple of properties while in the loop, name for example. At the end of each loop, the newly generated instance is added to an ArrayList held in a another, 3rd, class. p  pThe problem however is that when a new element is added, for whatever reason, all previous elements change to match exactly the latest. My guess is that the ArrayList is creating a reference to the dynamically created element so that whenever it changes, they all change, but I do not know how to fix this.p  pI would be grateful for any advice and apologies again for the quality of this explanation.

The XMLHandler is being called from a SAX parser in another class not shown.

Negative 104797 pThe .NET call codeEnvironment.UserNamecode for the most part 99.9 of the time gives usernames in the same casing  for example codeAwebbcode.

Negative 104797 pCurrently my database design is not normalised.p  pWhen a user visits the website all the data such as the full browser name, OS name, etc are stored. This is causing the database to grow very fast at a rate of about 10GB a day with just 2 million people a day 2 million inserts per day. However this only means that there is only one insert per data. I am using mysql and php.p  pNow what I was wondering if it would be faster if I normalised the data. What I mean is create separate tables for OS name and OS ids, browser name and browser id. Then use the ids in the traffic log table. In this situation there would be two lookups in the browser table and the os table for the ids and if they dont exist then two inserts and then another insert with the browser id and os id in the traffic log table. So 2 selects and 2 potential inserts and 1 set insert.p  pWhich one is likely to be faster. Also are there any other options for file based approach for storing the os etc or maybe store the all possible browsers, os in arrays and then only insert if the visitor has one of those browsers or os else just put them in as none.p
Negative 104797 pImagine you have a derived class, where the base class is something you cannot modify.  The base class has a lot of state many nonconstant private members and many constructors, with varying numbers of arguments to initialize some subset of the state the size of the subset varies by constructor, of course.p  pNow my derived class is a very lightweight wrapper over the base class.  Lets assume it adds no state of its own, and only slightly modifies the behavior of a couple methods perhaps doing some additional logging around a codesuper.originalMethodcode call.p  pThe issue I have is that I want to take an object of the base class, and create a copy of it, with the same state, but as an instance of my derived class.p  pThis is proving difficult.  I cant call the most complete constructor of the base class, passing all the state from the source by calling getters, since depending on how the base class was constructed, some of the state values may be rejected by this constructor.  For example, you can create a default object with a 0arg ctor, any many values will be null.  It is not, however, legal to pass null values in the ctor that allows you to specify these values.p  pFurthermore, the method above is fragile because if a modification to the base class occurs which adds more state, and even more complete constructor or state which cant be set in a constructor, but only through accessor methods is added, the copy wont be complete any more.p  pWhat I want is like clone, but rather initializing a new object of the same type, initialize the base class members of the derived class.  I guess such a thing doesnt exist.  Any suggestions on a pattern that might offer something equivalentp  pKeep in mind I cannot modify the base class.  If I could, this would be much easier.p

By default, Maven23 will deploy the assembly generated together with the main artifact to remove Maven repository.  Is there any way that I can deploy only the main artifact but not the assemblypli lipI have an artifact, in which I have jar plugin generate another artifact with different classifier more specific, an EJB artifact, and I generate an client JAR.  I want to deploy only the client JAR to Maven repo coz I think the main EJB artifact is not really going to be shared by other project.  Is it possible to do sopli ol  pThanks a lotp  hr  peditied to provide more infop  pThe reason for avoiding deploy the EJB, is because the EJB main artifact is not going to be depended by other project except the containing project.  The containing project will build a EAR which contains the EJB, and normally we only need that build locally by mvn package.  However, the EJB client is something that we will deploy to our repo to let other project share when they need to communicate with our application.  p  pHonestly it doesnt harm to deploy the EJB too, but I just want to see if I can save unnecessary waste of disk space on our repository.p  pSimilarly, for deploying assembly, it is because the project is something we want to deploy to let other project to depends on.  However, when building that project, we also have a separate assembly created on the same time for example, an allinone executable jar which we only need that built locally, and it is not something that other projects will depends on.p

But now I need to move this encrypted data to a file, so that the user can take the file that contains the encrypted data, to decrypt, so that he gets his original file provided he entered the correct key.p  pHopefully that was clear enough. All help is greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 104797 pIm planning to create a WebGLbased, realtime strategy game, where players are able to play together. Ill use Node.js to create the game server, and websockets for realtime connections.p  pIve broken my mind about what would be the best concept to synchronize the clients.p  pOne possibility would be to send only the orders of the users moving units, building buildings etc. to the server, which sends them to all other clients. But here, I have the problem of the delay. I think that the games would get async this way.p  pAnother possibility would be to calulate the game on the server. The clients still send the instructions to the server, but the server sends now all changed states of all unitsampbuildings to the clients in a high interval. The problem is here the high amount of data and how fast this can be...p  pDo you have some other ideas or improvement proposalsp  pThanksp

Negative 104797 pI have a quick questionp  pHow can I return a Cstyle 2 dimensional array from an Objective C method, containing pointers to various objects that I can address using myArray[x][y].someProperty or [myArray[x][y] someMethodCallmyArgument] Im guessing that something like NSData would need to be used to package the return data, which would be unpackaged on the other end.p  pThe objects that need to be addressed like so are stored internally inside the Objective C class as a 1 dimensional NSMutableArray, which has a capacity equal to widthheight. Im aware that some pointer magic is going to have to happen here to translate between the Cstyle 2D array and the actual 1 dimensional NSMutableArray.p  pIs this possiblep  pCheers, Keven Tippingp

Negative 104797 pIm trying to use some Android library on my project but Im having a problem with minimum SDK version and target SDK version. The library Im talking about is a hrefhttpsgithub.comjohannilssonandroidactionbartreemimicnativeapi relnofollowthis ActionBara. It says on the readme that emThis projects aims to provide a reusable action bar component for Android 1.6 and up to 3.0em.p  pI want to target my application at 1.6 if I happen to need some higher APIs, Ill change it when I have to and so I created an Eclipse project for the ActionBar with the build target as API Level 4 1.6. Despite the library codeminSdkVersioncode being set to 4 and codetargetSdkVersioncode set to 10 the project doesnt compile though. Theres 3 errors to be exact that I think belong to API Level 10 2.3.3, at least one of them I know for sure cause its trying to use codeBuild.VERSIONCODES.GINGERBREADcode, which doesnt exist on API Level 4.p  pHow come the library supports emAndroid 1.6 and up to 3.0em and doesnt even compile with 1.6 in mind cause its using stuff from a higher APIp  pFine I thought, lets set the API Level to 10 and see what happens. The errors are gone and now I just have a warning, just like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3911258whathappensiftheminsdkversionislowerthanthetargetsdkversionthis onea. I can live with that, its no biggie but if theres any way to remove that from Eclipse, let me know please.p  pThen I created my project targeting 1.6, I referenced the library into my project but I cant compilerun it because the same errors as above apply also here.p  pHow can I workaround this If the library supposedly supports emAndroid 1.6 and up to 3.0em, how can I use on my project that targets Android 1.6p

Which to usea, one of the answers is actually a question that hasnt been answered [QUOTE]strongp  pQuestion, many here say that Pt are only for print. But isnt it nice to have a simple ability to make the text the size you want fast without remembering what DIV has what Em or  value. For example, when you havep  precodeltbodygt  ltdiv idbox1gt    test text sample1    ltdiv idbox2gt      test text sample2      ltdiv idbox3gt        test text sample3         ltdiv idbox4gt           test text sample4         ltdivgt      ltdivgt    ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI know it is a kind of weird structure, but lets say that a layout needs a structure like that for graphic purposes and CSS image layering. So I would like to make box1 font  100, box2  1.2em. box3  .8em, and box4  1.6emp  pNow, the problem is that Em from box 1 also transfers to all its children, correct me if I am wrong, so it means that box2 is not exactly 1.2em, and by the time when we get to box 4 font size its really hard to say what it is.

However when I reinstall the app or restart the iPhone they seem to arrive. p  pIm not sure if this is a problem within my app or not, as even when the app is closed and handling of the notification should rest completely with the Operating System no notification is recieved until a restartreinstall is done.p  pThe feedback service yields nothing, and NSLogging the received notification within the app also yields nothing like the notification never makes it to the appp  pEDITp  pSome additional information, as nobody seems to know whats going on.p  pI am using the sandbox server, with the app signed with the developer provisioning profile, so theres no problems there. And the App recieves the notifications initially.p  pThe problem seems to be that when the app doesnt recieve anything when its in the background for about 90s120s it just stops receiving anything until it is reinstalled.p  pEven double tapping home and stopping the app that way doesnt allow it to recieve notifications in the app closed state. Which I would have thought would have eliminated problems with the apps coding entirely, since at that point its not even running.p  pI timed it to see after  how long it stops recieving notifications.

Negative 104797 pIm trying to use dynamic sets to handle the way Excel 2010 does subqueries when using filters, but Im running into what seems to be a strange bug in the MDX query engine.p  pSuppose I have a time hiearchy with Year  Month  Date.

But if I change this to December 21 2011, January 22 2012, Feb 12 2012 so that it spans a year, I will get around 1500 or as many days as there are in the time dimension It works fine with spanning weeks and months but not year Its the same if I use count on the set. The strange thing is that it sometimes works, e.g. if I select the whole of 2011. p  pI have encountered this bug with two different cubes and 3 different hierarchies. If I have a hierarchy of Year tertial month week and day, it will work on year, tertial, week. But not month and day.p  pAny idea what is going on here p

When all combinations with THAT prime are done, drop it, and repeat with the next lowest prime number available on the primes generator.p  pMy attempts to do this with recursive generators have gotten me very confused on when to pop out of the recursion with yield , or raise StopIteration, or return, or simply fall out of the recursed function.p  pThanks for your wisdomp  pADDITIONAL NOTEp  pI emdoem have one way to do this now I have written a function to factor numbers, so I can factor them down to primes, and yield the results.  No problem.  I keep this blazingly fast by relying on a cache of what is the lowest prime factor of number N... for N up to 10 million.p  pHowever, once Im out of the cache, well, it devolves to naive factoring. Yuck.p  pThe point of this post isp  ul liIm assuming that generating large composites from their factors will be faster than factoring large composites... especially since I DONT care about order, andli liHow can you have a Python generator recursively call itself, and yield a single stream of generated thingsli ul

Negative 104797 pI have a small project in my webprogramming course where I am supposed to make a small game in javascript. This is the game two cannons are fixed on opposing ends of the game space. The cannons take turns shooting at each other, and the player tilts the cannon to some degree and chooses a force to shoot the cannonball with. Theres a bunch of other stuff Im thinking of that will be added if theres time.p  pI found a nice site, a hrefhttpwww.rodedev.comtutorialsgamephysics relnofollowhttpwww.rodedev.comtutorialsgamephysicsa, to get me going with 2d physics and Ive made some tests, see the code below. I do however have two big problemsp  ol liNonflat floorground.li liRotationli ol  pRight now the script is only checking for the style.top value of the floorDiv, so the box will always land on this row of pixels. If I want to have  variableheight terrain, this wont suffice. Any ideas from you guys on how this could be accomplished Is there anyway to check the color at a specific pixel If so I could check for nonsky or ground colored pixels and make this the landing critera.p  pI need to rotate the cannon so players can adjust their aim Im thinking Ill make two different cannon objects, the cannon base and the cannon barrel. Then I could just rotate the cannon barrel when the player presses a key. Unfortunately rotation seems to be hard in webprogramming. I found this jquery plugin, at a hrefhttpcode.google.compjqueryrotate relnofollowhttpcode.google.compjqueryrotatea, but Im not getting it to work quite as I would like. Even though Ive made sure the cannonball is centered in the picture there is also some translation, not just rotation. I suppose this might be because the picture doesnt rotate about its center See the rotation test code below youll have to download the rotation plugin if you want to try the code. I suppose I could just make a picture for each angle but that seems kind of wasteful since theres no actual visual change to the cannon otherwise.p  pAlso, if I want to animate several objects at the same time, do you think I should just change all the objects in the same gameloop function Any ideas on thisp  pThe following is the code for the physicstestingp  pCSSfilep  precodemoveDiv

Negative 104797 pWe have a large nested observable array mapped though templates to create a tree view.  The list is dynamic, but there are potentially 1000 elements in the tree. p  pWe are having performance issues loading and searching this collection  most noticeably in IE8 and iPad. Chrome seems ok.p  pThe elements in the collection dont actually change, so I dont think we need the notify aspects of the observables, but we want to take advantage of the databinding. p  pIs there a way to do databinding to objects in your viewmodel which are not observable Is there a way to create nonobservable complex data collections without using ko.mapping.fromJSp

Bobs current average is 60, teacher 1 wants to update his average with a test where he got 70 and teacher 2 wants to update his average with a test where he scored 40. p  pSo in the 1 to a million chance that the 2 teachers hit the update button simultaneously, precisely to the splitsecond exactly at the same time, what will happen Will it give an error message, does php or mysql magically queue updates, will only the first score update bobs average and the second user get an errorp  pEdit My concern is that the second user must get the value after the first user edited the values, I was thinking of fetching the record then doing the calculations in php and then updating the record again, but in this situation how can I ensure that the second user fetches a value of 65 and not 60, can this be done with transactionsp

Negative 104797 pI am building an eCommerce system that uses composite bucket hashing to efficiently group similar items. Without going into why I chose this system, suffice it to say it solves several key problems facing distributed eCommerce system.p  pThere are 11 buckets, all of them ints, which represent various values. Lets call these fields A to K. The 12th field, L,  is an array of product IDs. Think of this all as a hierarchy with the leaf level L being data.p  pI ran some initial tests in MongoDB where I stored this data as individual documents. However, this is not efficient because a given set of A to K could have many L values, so these can be stored as an array.p  pThis gives me two optionsp  ol liInsert a meaningless id document id, and put an index on A  K to ensure uniqueness. I already ran some tests on indexes, and indexing more that the first 2 columns impacts speed substantially.li liMake A  K a composite id, and have one document data field L.li ol  pI know 2 is a highly unconventional use of MongoDB. Are there any technical reasons why I shouldnt do this If not, using the official C driver, how would I perform this insertp

Negative 104797 pI have a stack of UIViewControllers currently, each is a modal ViewController presented over the previous one.

The intention is to have the callback fire after the ajax content has been loaded ie after the codeajaxPagecode function has been executedp  pCan anyone see what the problem is Is there a better way of implementing a callback function in plain javascriptp  pstrongPS no jQuerystrongp

Negative 104797 pI am quite stuck I need to compress the content of a folder, where I have multiple files extension .dat. I went for shell scripting.p  pSo far I told myself that is not that hard I just need to recursively read the content of the dir, get the name of the file and zip it, using the name of the file itself.p  pThis is what I wrotep  precodefor i in .dat do zip i.zip i done codepre  pNow when I try it I get a weird behavior each file is called like 12232012 data102 test1.dat and when I run this sequence of commands I see that zip instead of recognizing the whole file name, see each part of the string as single entity, causing the whole operation to fail.p  pI told myself that I was doing something wrong, and that the i variable was wrong so I have replaced echo, instead than the zip command to see which one was the output of the i variable and the i output is the full name of the file, not part of it.p  pI am totally clueless at this point about what is going on...if the variable i is read by zip it reads each single piece of the string, instead of the whole thing, while if I use echo to see the content of that variable it gets the correct output.p  pDo I have to pass the value of the filename to zip in a different way Since it is the content of a variable passed as parameter I was assuming that it wont matter if the string is one or has spaces in it, and I cant find in the man page the answer if there is any in there.p  pAnyone knows why do I get this behavior and how to fix it Thanks p

Negative 104797 pIve been reading a lot of blogs which advocate the emfat models and skinny controllersem approach, esp. the Rails camp. As a result the routers is basically just figuring out what method to call on what controller and all the controller method does is call the corresponding method on the model and then bring up the view. So Ive two concerns here which I dont understandp  ol liThe controller and router are really not doing much different tasks other than just calling a method on the Godlike model based on the route.li liModels are doing too much. Sending emails, creating relationships, deleting and modifying other models, queuing tasks, etc. Basically now you have Godlike objects that are supposed to do everything that may or may not concern with modeling and dealing with data.li ol  pWhere do you draw the line Isnt this just falling into the God patternp

Negative 104797 pI am creating an ePub reader on IOS. Basically,  I use uiwebview to load the xhtml files. Every time  page turn I need to load the file with uiwebview then call javascript to scroll to the right offset.  Here is a problem, some xhtml file is big like  2MB that it cost too much time to load. Thus the page turn animation is not so smooth. So I am thinking I could load the xhtml once with uiwebviewA , and each time page turn, I create another uiwebviewB and grab the needed html contentlike second page from uiwebviewA. In this way, I could limite the html into small size and the page turn animation should be smooth. My question is that is there any open source javascript library can do the job Any comments is appreciatedp

Negative 104797 pI want to be able to convert a PDF file to an HTML file via PHP, but am running into some trouble.p  pI found a basic way to do this using a hrefhttpsaaspose.com relnofollowSaasposea, which lets you convert PDFs to HTML files. There are some problems with this, however, such as the use of SVGs, images, positioning, fonts, etc.p  pAll I would need is the ability to grab the text from the PHP file and any images associated with it, and then display it in a linear format as opposed to it being formatted with absolute positioning.p  pWhat I mean by this is that if the PDF looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSb83em.png altenter image description herep  pId want to convert it to a single column design HTML file. If there were images, Id want them returned as well.p  pIs this possible in PHP I know I can simply grab the text from the PDF file, but what about grabbing images as wellp  pAnother problem is that I want everything to be inline, as its being served to the client in a single file. Currently, I can do this with my setup through some codep  precodefor i  0 i lt objectnumber i                  object  htmlgtfindobjectgtfindembedgteqi                 embed  filegetcontentsOutputOutputHtml . objectgtattrsrc                 arraypushconvertedobj, embed                 arraypushoriginalobj, object                           for i  0 i lt objectnumber i                 pqoriginalobj[i]gtreplaceWithconvertedobj[i]              codepre  pWhich grabs all the codeSVGcode files and displays them inline.

Negative 104797 pOn windows you can see pull up the task manager or codeGetProcesscode in powershell to get a  list of running processes along with their memory and cpu usage.p  pYou can also on windows 8 or codeGetServicecode in powershell view all running services. Yet for services you do not get any of those numbers.p  pFrom my developer point of view this always seemed a bit odd. Sure, a service requires a bunch more deployment effort and is awkward to code and debug, but otherwise its just a program same as any other.p  pIm sure theres a good reason for why services do not have those numbers, one that probably has something to do with how windows runs services.

Assuming the memory is byte addressable, and each integer takes up 4 bytes of memory, and say we allocate 40 bytes of memory to the pointer codepcode from address code0code to code39code.br Now, from what I understand, the pointer codepcode initially contains value code0code, i.e. the address of first memory location. In the loop, a displacement is added to the pointer to access the subsequent integers.  p  pI cannot understand how the memory addresses uptil code39code are accessed with a displacement value of only code0 to 9code. I checked and found that the pointer is incremented in multiples of 4. How does this happen Im guessing its because of the integer type pointer, and each pointer is supposedly incremented by the size of its datatype. Is this truep  pBut what if I actually want to point to memory location 2 using an integer pointer. So, I do this codep  2code. Then, when I try to dereference this pointer, should I expect a segmentation faultp

Negative 104797 pI have been trying to get a twitter search to work using NSJSONSerialization to parse the query results.  I originally used a tutorial on accessing Twitter data using an SLRequest, but Ive found that in doing this I need the results to update a property in order to save them. I want the fetching to be a class method, so Im avoiding using properties. The issue Im running into is a bit weird and Im not sure why it would be happening. Basically I can get the fetch with [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData ...] reliably  except for one keyvalue pair in the dictionary, the results. The value for the key results is returning as  , and is type NSArrayM. I can see that the URL I am sending to fetch the data is correct, and that the rest of the information in the parsed dictionary is correct.

As a user is inputing code into the web code editor, their keystrokes and clicks are being recorded so that they can later be played back.p  pThe idea would be that someone could write a snippet of code, and someone could later play back that snippet of code almost like a video to see how the coder arrived at that solution. Its sort of like a screen recording, except instead of recording the screen which wouldnt be possible without an application installed on the endusers system, Ill record their inputs as they happen so that those inputs can be replayed.p  pIs that possible using pythondjango Is there something already available in django or something else that would give me this recordingplayback functionalityp  pWould postgreSQL be able to keep up with all those readswrites if say 100 users were doing this at the same time This may be a task better suited for something like mongoDB, but Id prefer not to use a noSQL database as the DB for the entire site.p  pIf you feel theres a better framework for this like Rails Id be interested in hearing about that as well.p

Then I want to pipe the clientserverinteraction through this setup and verify it in between, or send specific messages to them individually, verifying the answer.  p  pIs something like that possible, or is there a better wayp

Negative 104797 pWe started having a weird error on production environment recently test environments works fine.p  pjava.lang.IllegalArgumentException Illegal pattern character yp  pThis is caused by the following codep  precodeSimpleDateFormat dateFormat  SimpleDateFormatDateFormat.getDateInstance dateFormat.applyLocalizedPatternyyyyMMdd codepre  pThis error is normally thrown when for example using Y instead of y for year. This is not the case here as you can see above. Im not 100 sure of the locale set on the server.

Negative 104797 pI have successfully created an online help in my application using JavaHelp.  At the first step I have created the example from JavaHelp so I had the typical menu with animal information.p  pIn the next step I changed all the hs, xml, and jhm and created new ones to have a skeleton of the help system of my application and not anything about animal kingdom.  Of course, I had to create the html pages, I just created the page, inserted some foo data and leave it like that. My next step was to create the actual help pages, but due to time and budget constraints some other people are going to do this part. The last step in the plan is to index the help system to have the search functionality available, for this I have read that I need to use the java indexer and then it would create be some files in a new folder called JavaHelpSearch.

Negative 104797 pI am using python which I am pretty new to and could do with some guidance with what I believe to be a string formatting problem.p  pI have an output from an external program that I want to translate into floats. The output contains two numbers that may or may not be in scientific notation and can have up to 15 digits after the decimal point which I have omitted here.p  p1.040e053.1676e03j I want this to become two separate numbers like this 0.00001040 , 0.0031676p  pother examples of the output data in its currently useless form are as follows 0.05726360.419420j would become  0.0572636 , 0.419420 0.0001944.85091e05jp  pI aim to take the two numbers contained in each pair of brackets, square them and add them together. If the result is two number in scientific notation then that is fine, so long as I am able to perform math operations on them. Also the minus sign doesnt need to survive the transformation as that would disappear when I square it anyway. If that makes things easier.p  pThe approach I am currently taking is a rather convoluted and messy method. Using x.find to locate the e,  and  and then interpreting which parts of the string should be extracted to form the number.p  pI am also unfamiliar with the re module and unsure how to use it to extract the right format.p  pAny help would be apprieciatedp

Negative 104797 pThe android tablets generally have a back button.  It displays like an arrow that did a Uturn.  For most native programs this means return to some previous screen.p  pIn my tablet Im showing a custom HTML5 web page.  I have an HTML5 SELECT control on my page.  When the user selects a value from it the control is hidden change CSS visibility, etc. through Javascript on the onchange event.  I also trap the onkeyup event in case the user hits the Escape button on a desktop device, etc.  I also trap the onblur event if the user taps outside of the control.p  pOn the tablet the user can click on the tablet back button.  The effect of this is to exit from the display of options to show the web page with a closed SELECT control.  This back button isnt being detected by my Javascript handlers.  p  pIs there an event for this that I can hook into in Javascript so I can hide my SELECT controlp  pUPDATE 0907 Here is an example of the behavior.  I have a place in a SVG graphic that responds to a touch event.  An HTML SELECT control is made visible and it is expanded automatically. Rather than show the option list as a HTML list in the web page, a fullscreen tablet option list is shown.  If I click on the back button of the tablet not the browser the select control is still shown displayed on the web page.  If I click on the select control itself the tablet option list is shown again. If I click on the tablet back button again the original logic I programmed in is completed.  Very strange.p  pThanks, Jerome.p

Userid1, 20131005 has a tau value of 1 because they havent logged back in when treating the current day as the 7th.  e.g So if someone hasnt logged back in, their tau value keeps increasing. So since userid1 last logged in on the 5th, they currently have a tau value of 1, and that value will keep increasing by 1 for everyday they dont log back in.

Negative 104797 pIn this script we have a stager function which will act as an intermediary for user interaction on the screen before data are sent back to the database.  The AJAX call succeeds, but instead of the query from the database inside the div, I have [object Object].  If I inspect the console I see that the data coming from the database are correct.  How can I change my code so I can get the text inside my div.  What fundamental element am I misunderstanding with AJAX and JavaScript in general tips to avoid this in the future.p  pEDIT just noticed thats its most likely due to the fact that my stageOptions object doesnt have AJAX calls as properties, but straight text.

Negative 104797 pWe have haproxy 1.3.26 hosted on CentOS 5.9 machine having 2.13 GHz Intel Xeon processor which is acting as a http amp tcp load balancer for numerous services, serving a peak throughput of 2000 requestssecond. It has been running fine for 2 years but gradually both traffic and number of services are increasing.p  pOff late weve observed that even after reload old haproxy process remains. On further investigation we found that old process has numerous connections in TIMEWAIT state. We also saw that codenetstatcode and codelsofcode were taking a long long time. On referring a hrefhttpagiletesting.blogspot.in201307themysteryofstalehaproxyprocesses.html relnofollowhttpagiletesting.blogspot.in201307themysteryofstalehaproxyprocesses.htmla we introduced codeoption forceclosecode but it was messing up with various monitoring service hence reverted it. On further digging we realised that in codeprocnetsockstatcode close to 200K sockets are in codetwcode codeTIMEWAITcode state which is surprising as in codeetchaproxyhaproxy.cfgcode codemaxconncode has been specified as 31000 and codeulimitncode as 64000. We had codetimeout servercode and codetimeout clientcode as code300scode which we changed to code30scode but not much use. p  pNow the doubts are p  ul liWhether such a high number of TIMEWAITs is acceptable. If yes whats a number after which we should be worried. Looking at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1803566whatisthecostofmanytimewaitontheserversideWhat is the cost of many TIMEWAIT on the server sidea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions337115settingtimewaittcpSetting TIMEWAIT TCPa seems there shouldnt be any issue.li liHow to decrease these TIMEWAITsli liAre there any alternatives to netstat and lsof which will perform fine even if there are very high number of TIMEWAITsli ul

But, i mustnt too ask the server  thats the difficulty.p  pSo I find a solution. p  pFirst I bind gridview to my database, then i want to export gridview datas to two XML files, one static and one as new source to gridview who is going to be sorted, in the aim to compare the twice after sorting, finding the changes and then update only the rows who are changed in the database. Do you think that is a good idea  Have you other idea to do that p  pIve to use an other method, because it is impossible to sort gridview dynamically for my situation.p

Negative 104797 pIm new on here, but not a total beginner to programming. I got a book on creating a 2D DirectX game engine so I could expand my programming knowledge, however I am new to C and DirectX itself, so Im afraid Im a bit clueless on working with multiple project files and headers. I decided to develop my game engine in a proper development environment, so I got VS2013 Professional though the Dreamspark program.p  pAs I said, I havent worked with something like VS before, so Im hitting issues with getting my game engine running and Im not sure what to do. The book said that if I get all my code down correctly in 3 .cpp source files, 3 headers and 1 main .cpp source file to initialize my engine in a blank game project the program should compile fine, and it does. The issue is that I only get the resultant .obj files and the projects static library file to appear in my project folder. I dont know what I have to do to get the project to compile the executable needed to actually run this blank game with the engine.p  pThe actual project solution was taken from the disk which came with the book, I wrote my code on top of that solution as my own was causing linker errors. The project properties show that the project is defined as a .lib project, so how is this supposed to work p  pI apologize if this is a simple problem, but Im only used to working with 1 file console applications in C, this is a big jump for me but Id like to understand how Im meant to get an .exe created from this project, I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me how this sort of .lib project works. I can post the code if its necessary, but theres 7 files of it so its quite long. Thanksp

Negative 104797 pIve quite new to Fortran and OpenMP, but Im trying to get my bearings. I have a piece of code for calculating variograms which Im attempting to parallelize. However, I seem to be getting race conditions, as some of the results are off by a thousandth or so. p  pThe problem seems to be the reductions. Using OpenMP reductions work and give the correct results, but they are not desirable, because the reductions actually happen in another subroutine I copied the relevant lines into the OpenMP loop for the test. Therefore I put the reductions inside a CRITICAL section but without success. Interestingly, the problem only occurs for reals, not integers. I have thought about whether or not the order of the additions make any difference, but they should not produce errors this big.p  pJust to check, I put everything in the parallel do in an ORDERED block, which of course gave the correct results albeit without any speedup. I also tried putting everything inside a CRITICAL section, but for some reason that did not give the correct results. My understanding is that OpenMP will flush the shared variables upon enteringexiting CRITICAL sections, so there shouldnt be any cache problems.p  pSo my question is why doesnt a critical section work in this casep  pMy code is below. All shared variables except emnpem, emtmem, emhmem, emgamem are readonly.p  pEDIT I tried to simulate the randomness induced by multiple threads by replacing the do loops with random integers in the same range i.e. generate a pair i,j in the of the loops if they are visited, generate new ones and to my surprise the results matched. However, upon further inspection it was revealed that I had forgotten to seed the RNG, and the results were correct by coincidence. How embarrassingp  pTLDR The discrepancies in the results were caused by the ordering of the floating point values.

Negative 104797 pI am running g on a Linux system where my stable header files exist in a readonly directory inc and the ones I am working on are in inctest. As a result of this, the same filename can exist in both directories. I want to be able to keep it this way, so that I always include any headers present in inctest before any are included from inc. p  pThe problem I am having is that at different times it seems to arbitrarily take from either of those directories, rather than always the same one first.p  pThat is, I run g Iinctest Iinc a.cpp b.cpp ...p  pand sometimes I get the one from inc, other times I get the one from inctest.p  pIs the order that my I parameters are specified irrelevant The man page for g says Order does matter when you use several options of the same kind. p  pIs there some other way I can guarantee always including headers from one directory before their same named counterpart in another directory I still need to include both, as inc contains all of the headers that I am not currently working on. Renaming the ones I am working on is not helpful because then I need to change all of my includes...p  pEdit I dug a little deeper and noticed that a header in inc is including another header that exists in both inc and inctest. I copied this header temporarily to inctest and sure enough, it now included the correct one. Is this a bug or proper behaviourp

Negative 104797 pIm development an app through titanium.

With Password. Note, the keyboard is still up for textfield.li liClick Resume button, return back to app.li liNow, if you try to dismiss keyboard, it just stuck there. And keyboard no response until next TextField or TextArea.li ul  pAnd this always happens. Im not sure if this is a bug from Titanium or iOS itself. Im trying to replicate by native objective c code.p  pDoes anyone have clue how to fix thisp  pThanksp  pUPDATESp  ol liIve tried to replicate by native SDK. Nothing happened. So I guess this is a bug only for Titanium.li liFinally address the problem, when you open the number pad for guided access then go back to app, it will cause the textfield lose focus. So, if user tapclick the textField, then there will be no problem.li liAnd there is another scenario There are two window, A and B. B has a textField, and Ive set it focus when it opened. In Window A, I triple click home button and open the number pad to enter password. Go back to app, open window B. Now since Ive programmatically focus the textfield, so nobody click the textField. Now if you try to dismiss the keyboard without touchclick the textfield, you will see the same bug happened before. While if you click the textField, manually refocus it, there will be no problem.li ol

Negative 104797 pIm looking at making some custom GWT widgets styled in a uniform fashion without requiring the designer to go into each widgets UI file every time they want something to appear differently.  I would provide a bunch of base styles for elements in the widget and the designer comes along later and sets, in UIBinder, HTML, CSS, anything really, the style using the same selector.p  pFor example I have a composite widget which I have setup to use a CSSResource.  This CSS resource has a style named .myHeaderStyle which is applied to an element on the composite.p  pThis composite is used in another GWT Widget and needs to appear slightly differently when used in the enclosing widget.p  pMy hope here is that I can specify another style in the UIBinder definition of that UI also named .myHeaderStyle and have this style override the style specified in the composite widgets CSSResource.  p  pHowever, in my attempts to make this happen even with important included on the style properties that are to override the initial style, Im only getting the original .myHeaderStyle set on the composite widget.p  pIm trying to specifically avoid addingchanging the style in the composite every time we compile, I want it to inherit from the enclosing page effectively overriding the composite widgets original styling.p  pIs what Im trying to do possible in some form with GWTCSSp
Negative 104797 pI have a administration website that uses icons to indicate when something can be deleted, edited or created. I use bootstraps tooltip to do that, and binding a tooltip to all elements on every page that has delete iconsbuttons is easyp  precode.deletebtn.tooltip   placement top,   title Slet  codepre  pSince I use ajax and dom manipulation to add new elements new delete buttons, the previous example will not add tooltip to newly after document ready added buttons. I found a solution like thisp  precodebody.tooltip     selector .deletebtn,     placement top,     title Slet  codepre  pThat works as well. The problem is that i need tooltips on .editbtn as well. I figured i could just replicate the above example and change the selector to .editbtn. The thing is  it doesnt work  only the first tooltip on the body element seems to work. I tried swapping the order and then i can get .editbtn to work, but then .deletebtn stops working. It seems only only tooltip can be set on a given element body at a time, and only the first one works  even when i pass different selectorsp  pAm I missing something here  is there an easy solution to this I would really love if i dont have to manually initialize every newly created element with a tooltip manually. I was also thinking of doing ap  precodebody.onmouseover, .btndelete, function... body.onmouseout, .btndelete, .... codepre  pBut that seems like a lot of work and moves the responsibility of showing the tooltips away from bootstraps plugin and into my own code...p

If I quit the application and restartit and go into my recording list menu again it will correctly show the correct number of subentites.p  pI use the following code in ViewDidLoad of my strongPreviousFlightVC.mstrong to load my flightsp  precodeNSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNameFlightRecording]  NSSortDescriptor originSort          [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyoriginAirport ascendingYES]  NSSortDescriptor destinationSort          [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeydestinationAirport ascendingYES]  NSSortDescriptor dateSort          [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyrecordingStart ascendingYES]   fetchRequest.sortDescriptors  [originSort, destinationSort, dateSort] [fetchRequest setIncludesSubentitiesYES]  self.frc  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestfetchRequest managedObjectContext[self managedObjectContext] sectionNameKeyPathnil cacheNamenil]  self.frc.delegate  self NSError fetchingError  nil if [self.frc performFetchampfetchingError]      NSLogSuccess Fetch  else      NSLogFetch Error  codepre  pFor each cell Im generating the Count as such p  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath   RecordingRowCell cell  nil  if UIUSERINTERFACEIDIOM  UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad         IPAD Version      cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierRecordingRowCell]  else        Iphone table Cells      cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifieriphoneFlightCell]   FlightRecording rec  [[[self frc] fetchedObjects] objectAtIndex[indexPath row]]   Count the records int recordCount  [rec.ahrsMessages count] NSLogd, recordCount   ... codepre  pDoes anybody have any ideas why I might be seeing this behavior  Could I some how have left the data open for writing  Any suggestions would be great.

Negative 104797 pSo Im building a framework for reproduceable articles. p  pEach article will be composed of a combination of sections which basically constitute an html block and some associated content. For example a given article may be composed as followsp  precodeauthor section text section image section text section blockquote section carousel section text section codepre  pIm imagining theres a partial template for each section, and as mentioned the sections will have associated data, so for a text section it might just be the copy although it could be a markdown file, for an image section it might be a collection of urls and alt tags and so forth. Each article will also need an associated CSS amp JS file for any bespoke modifications, as well as its own image repo.p  pThe ultimate structure I need to end up with after building looks like thisp  precodesite     [shared]css     [shared]img     [shared]js     articles         article01             [article specific]css             [article specific]img             [article specific]js             index.html         article02             [article specific]css             [article specific]img             [article specific]js             index.html codepre  pObviously it would be fairly simple to just copy and paste HTMLCSS files, change a few values and build it all with grunt, but Im trying to avoid copy paste duplication and it seems like assemble could be the answer. p  pSo my broad plan was to use assemble to compose the articles, with the goal of being able to generate a new article simply by populating a .json file or similar.p  pIn my head it looks something like thisp  precode    title    Article Title,   sections [             type    text,       data            content    Lorem iplsum dolor...            ,             type    author,       data            name    Bob Servant,         meta    As if you dont know who Bob Servant is,         url    bobservant.com            ,             type    image,       data            src     httpplacehold.it300x300,         alt   Bob Servant               ]  codepre  pThis .json file would dictate the order of the sections, and provide the content, hopefully negating the need for an individual .hbs template for each article.p  pIn my default template Im basically looking to achieve the following pseudo codep  precodeforeach section    get the the appropriate template and pass it the associated data object  codepre  pThe other problem Im struggling with is the fact that I want to have generic partials such as text.hbs, image.hbs author.hbs etc, but I need to be able to have multiple instances included within a given article, each with their own data.p  pI suppose ultimately its a problem of abstraction, both in terms of how far its appropriate to decouple the templates and data, but also how to go about binding the data to the correct instance of the template... if that makes sense. p  pIf anyone has any helpful suggestions that would be very much appreciated.

Negative 104797 pFor reference, the problem Im trying to solve is efficiently finding and removing duplicates in a table that could have a lot of entries.p  pThe table I am working with is called PersistedDay with a dayString object in it its a string. P. There are more columns that arent relevant to this question. Id like to find any PersistedDays that have duplicates.p  pIn SQL, this is one of the efficient ways you can do that FYI, I can do this query on the CoreData backing SQLite DBp  precodeSELECT ZDAYSTRING FROM ZPERSISTEDDAY GROUP BY ZDAYSTRING HAVING COUNTZDAYSTRING gt 1 codepre  pThis returns ONLY the dayStrings that have duplicates and you can then get all of the fields for those objects by querying using the resulting day strings you can use it as a sub query to do it all in one request.p  pNSFetchRequest seems to have all of the required pieces to do this too, but it doesnt quite seem to work. Heres what I tried to dop  precodeNSManagedObjectContext context  [self managedObjectContext]  NSFetchRequest request  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNamePersistedDay inManagedObjectContextcontext] [request setEntityentity]  NSPropertyDescription dayStringProperty  entity.propertiesByName[dayString]  request.propertiesToFetch  [dayStringProperty] request.propertiesToGroupBy  [dayStringProperty] request.havingPredicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat dayString.count gt 1] request.resultType  NSDictionaryResultType  NSArray results  [context executeFetchRequestrequest errorNULL] codepre  pThat doesnt work. P If I try that I get an error Unsupported function expression countdayString when trying to do the fetch. I dont think the dayString in dayString.count even matters in that code above...but, I put it in for clarity SQL count just operates on the grouped rows.p  pSo, my question is is this possible and, if so, what is the syntax to do it I couldnt find anything in the CoreData docs to indicate how to do this.p  pI found one similar SO posts that I now unfortunately cant find again that was about running a count in a having clause I dont think there was a group by. But, the poster gave up and did it a different way after not finding a solution. Im hoping this is more explicit so maybe someone has an answer. p  pFor reference, this is what I am doing for now that DOES work, but requires returning almost all the rows since there are very few duplicates in most casesp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext context  [self managedObjectContext]  NSFetchRequest request  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNamePersistedDay                                           inManagedObjectContextcontext] [request setEntityentity]  NSPropertyDescription dayStringProperty  entity.propertiesByName[dayString]   Get the count of dayString... NSExpression keyPathExpression  [NSExpression expressionForKeyPath dayString]  Does not really matter NSExpression countExpression  [NSExpression expressionForFunction count arguments [NSArray arrayWithObjectkeyPathExpression]] NSExpressionDescription expressionDescription  [[NSExpressionDescription alloc] init] [expressionDescription setName dayStringCount] [expressionDescription setExpression countExpression] [expressionDescription setExpressionResultType NSInteger32AttributeType]  request.propertiesToFetch  [dayStringProperty, expressionDescription] request.propertiesToGroupBy  [dayStringProperty] request.resultType  NSDictionaryResultType  NSArray results  [context executeFetchRequestrequest errorNULL] codepre  pI then have to loop over the result and only return the results that have dayStringCount  1. Which is what the having clause should do. Pp  pNOTE I know CoreData isnt SQL.  Just would like to know if I can do the equivalent type of operation with the same efficiency as SQL.p
Negative 104797 pI have a chain of ajax requests.  They are used for copying category tree from one parent to another.  In case if any of copied categories has subcategories, the ajax request is run once again. This loop ends only after there are no any subcategories left.p  pProccessing all subcategories in ohe request causes server timeout error when there are too many subcategories, that is why separate ajax requests are used for subcategories. p  pHere is the basic scheme of the codep  precodefunction ajaxProcessCategoriesarguments   .ajax     ...     success functionjsonData             ...       ifjsonData.hasOwnPropertychildren         for var i in jsonData.children           ajaxProcessCategoriesarguments     ,     ...     codepre  pit works just fine.

This causes the errors. And you seemingly cant stop the automatic reencoding.br And a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma28880393716796httpstackoverflow.coma28880393716796a  by Artefacto brstrongPHP does not use the wide WIN32 APIstrong calls, so youre limited by the codepage.br And at a hrefhttpsbugs.php.netbug.phpid47096 relnofollowhttpsbugs.php.netbug.phpid47096a  there is the bug report for PHP.brp  blockquote   pstrongThough on there nicolas suggests, that a COMobject might workstrong brstrongfs  new COMScripting.FileSystemObject, null,   CPUTF8strongbrp blockquote  pMaybe I will try that sometimes.brbr strongemSo there is the part of my questionleft  Is there PHP6 out, or was it withdrawn, or is there anything new on PHP about that topicemstrongp  p full Questionbr The most questions about this topic are 1 to 5 years old. Could php now save a file using fileputcontentsdir .  . POST[fileName], POST[content]p  pwhen the POST[fileName] is UTF8 encoded, for example .xml  Currently it is saved as .xmlp  pI checked the fileName variable, so I can be sure its UTF8 echo mbdetectencodingPOST[fileName]p  ol liIs there now anything new in PHP that could accomplish itli liAt some places I read PHP 6 would be able to do it, but PHP 6 if i I remember right, has been withdrawn. li liIn Windows Explorer I can change the name of a file to .xml. As far as I have understood the old questionsampanswers, it should be possible to use fileputcontents if the fileNamevar is simply encoded to the encoding used by windows 7 and its NTFS disc. There is even 3 old question with answers that claim to have succeededbr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7502685phpfilehandlingwithutf8specialcharactersPHP File Handling with UTF8 Special Charactersa br a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6980068howtoconvertutf16letoutf8inphphow to convert UTF16LE to UTF8 in phpa br and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6467501phphowtocreateunicodefilenamesPHP How to create unicode filenamesa brbrOverall and most approved answers say it is not possible.  I checked all suggested answers already myself, and none works.li liHow to definitly and with absolute accuracy find out, in which encoding my Win 7 and Explorer saves the filename on my NTFS disc and with German language setting As said I can create a file .xml in the Explorer.li ol  pMy conclusion br 1. Either fileputcontents doesnT work correctly when handing over the fileName which I tried with conversions to UTF16, UTF16LE, ISO88591 and Windows1252 to Windows,  br2. or fileputcontents just doesnt implement a way to call Windows own file function in the appropriate way so this second possibility would mean its not a bug but just not implemented. For example notepad has no problems creating, writing and renaming a file called .xml.p  pJust one example of the error messages I got, in this case when I used  mbconvertencodingtheFilename , Windows1252 , UTF8p  pWarning fileputcontentsdirToSaveIn.xml failed to open stream No error in Caa xampphtdocsmyinterface.lomyinterfacephpWriteLocalSearchResponseXML.php on line 26  With other conversion I got other error messages, ranging from invalid characters to no string recognized at all.p  pGreetings John  p

But Im thinking of the few that I may have missed.

Negative 104797 pI am running my rails 4 application with nginxpassenger server, and the SSL is on my AWS load balance.

Just by adding the redirection on the load balance doesnt do the work.p  pThen I tried forcessl on the production config on rails,  that didnt work either, because it shows me that the server is trying to look for the controller under the public folder.. and throw me a 404.p  pAnother solution I was trying to do was adding this part on my sitesenableddefault filep  precodelocation      needed to forward users IP address to rails   proxysetheader  XRealIP  remoteaddr     needed for HTTPS   proxysetheader XFORWARDEDPROTO https    proxysetheader  XForwardedFor proxyaddxforwardedfor   proxysetheader Host httphost   codepre  pThat code above at least redirect the url to https but Nginx still show me the 404 code.

Negative 104797 pI want to learn how the KnuthMorrisPratt algorithm works. I watched this tutorial form the Princeton University a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchviZ93Unvxwtw relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchviZ93Unvxwtwa . In this Video they use a table, with length of the alphabet  number of lines and length of the Pattern number of  columns. The see the table as an DFA which is used to detect the pattern in the text. I think this approach is interesting but Wikipedia says that the KnuthMorrisPratt algorithm uses a prefix table with only one line for the length of the prefixes. Both works and both is Onm in therms of speedn is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern. But the DFA Version needs more Space.

Negative 104797 pI am building a phonegap based app and trying to update and manage the push notification badge in it.

Negative 104797 pI have banged my head against the wall for a couple of days on this one.

This issue is the format of the messages that come back from the  Xerces parser.  Problem is, I want the field name and linecolumn numbers for  where the error occurred without having to dig it out of a long String that  is different for various errors. Seems like it should be simple but Spring does  not seem to make this easy. And once the error appears at the handleRequestValidationErrors  routine, the exception messages have been formatted already.  p  pSpecifically I would like to either replace the XMLErrorReporter or the MessageFormatter that the XMLErrorReporter uses in the schema validator that Spring creates.  Xerces provides a standard property for replacing the  error reporter however, Spring does not make this easy. It uses a  hardcoded JAXP factory called Jaxp13ValidatorFactory to create  an XMLValidator object that essentially wraps creation of a  Xerces validator at each request handling.  XMLValidator does not allow setting of properties on the validator implementations it  creates.  p  pI have looked at custom configuration of Xerces as well as other  possible hacks, and at this point the only thing I can think of is to override the handleRequest routine in the XsdValidationInterceptor to create my own validators that I can configure as needed.p  pAnybody have any better ideas  p  pThis is the same question asked here, but unfortunately not answeredp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions130960howcaniprovidecustomerrormessagesusingjaxpdocumentbuilderHow can I provide custom error messages using JAXP DocumentBuilderap

My purpose for this, is Im teaching a Portable Programming class next semester, and I want to be able to just copy or give the student a .zip file, have them expand it on a specifically named volume, and the environment works.  This includes the SDK versions, AVDs, etc.  Ive got everything apparently working so far, but have a problem with the AVDs.p  pThis is a new install, using latest Eclipse, etc.p  pId hoped to find these directories, etc. within an XMLINI file, and use an editor or sed to change the strings, but cant seem to find the directory names of anything Ive needed to change so far within an XMLINI file within the unzipped Android directory  but dont see them.p  pI do see a reference within PreferencesAndroidBuild Default debug keystore that references .android  but it is not editable.  There IS a custom debug keystore setting on the same dialog page, but changing it does not seem to have an effect on the AVDs and their location.  So far, thats the ONLY reference Ive found for my home directory.  Ive looked at the Eclipse CLI at a hrefhttphelp.eclipse.orglunaindex.jsptopic2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user2Ftasks2Frunningeclipse.htm relnofolloweclipse.orga, but dont seem to see anything relating to this issue at least not anything thats ringing a bell with me.p  pSo  how can I change my default home directory without boogering up the environment, etc. for EclipseAndroid, so my AVDs and whatever else I HAVENT run into yet, can be installed and usedrun from the USB drivestick  p  pPlease  I DO NOT WANT links to other portable packages, as Im not sure whats actually been altered in them and probably not current, and an update is likely to hose everything anyway, and dont want to pass along anything to students.  Im downloading official packages from official locations, and want to keep it that way.  So Im only looking for things that can be fixededited within an officially installed environment to get the effect Im looking for. Thanksp
Negative 104797 pHi I am new to Angular and javascript and need a bit of help. p  pI have a service that will need to aggregate data from various locations. I am building a subservice to pull data from one of these locations. This subservice needs to 1 retrieve data from a REST web service, 2 massage it a bit and 3 return the final data to the invoking service. p  pI have steps 1 and 2 working, however I am running into a problem on the third. In general, I am having a hard time understanding promises. Yes, Ive read the documentation, googled around, even saw a cartoon on it, still cant figure it out.... Anyway, here is the relevant codep  precodeapp.serviceadvsolr,[http,functionhttp      var DEBUG  false     var conf  getconf     var solr  serverurl     var res       var data        this.query   functionsearchp          Run Search         querysolrsearchp         return data            var querysolr  functionsearch          var g  serverurl works fine         if DEBUG  console.logg          http.getg.thenfunctionresponse             res  response.data  this works             parsesearchres this massages the data and sticks it in the data object             return data this does absolutely nothing here               ] codepre  pThe main query method is ran by the other service. This queries a Solr instance, gets the results and massages them into the format I want. I know I can do this elsewhere, but I want to have this as a standalone service for portability and plus I just want this to work dammit. p  pSo the query method runs, I had some other stuff in there, but I took it out for this example since it would not add value. It hits querysolr which gets the data and massages it with parsesearchres, which sticks it into the data global variable. p  pNow the issue is that query method returns the empty data before parsesearchres had a chance to load the data in it. How can I prevent the query method from returning without the data p  pThanksp

Negative 104797 pWhat would be the consequences of inserting a positive lookbehind for nbytes, codeltCncode, into the beginning of any arbitrary regular expression, particularly when used for replacement operationsp  pAt least within PHP, the regex match functions, codepregmatchcode and codepregmatchallcode, allow for matching to begin after a given byte offset. There is no corresponding feature in any of the other PCRE PHP functions  you can specify a limit to the number of replacements done by codepregreplacecode for instance, but not that those replacements matches must occur after nbytes.p  pThere would obviously be some lets call them trivial consequences to performance and readability, but would there be any nontrivial impacts, like matches becoming nonmatches except when they are not offset by n bytes or replacements becoming malformedp  pSome examplesp  pcodesome expressioncode becomes codeltC4some expressioncode for a 4byte offsetp  pcodethis has groupsicode becomes codeltC2this has groupsicode for a 2byte offsetp  pAs far as I can tell, and from the limited tests that Ive run, adding in this lookbehind effectively simulates this offset parameter and doesnt mess with any other lookbehinds, substitutions, or other control patterns but Im also not an expert on Regex.p  pIm trying to determine if there are any likely consequences to building replacefilter function extensions by inserting the nbyte lookbehind into patterns. It should operate just as the match functions offset parameter works  so simply running the expression against codesubstr subject, offset code wont work for the same reasons it doesnt for codepregmatchcode most notably it cuts off any lookbehinds and codecode then incorrectly matches the start of the substring, not the original string.p

Negative 104797 pWhile prototyping out an API amp SDK, Ive run into this question with several plausible solutions. Im looking for help with some of the high level architecture. In short, it is guaranteed that some consuming applications of the API are going to want to configure their own authentication providers.p  pOptions that Ive been munching onp  ol liKeep resource server and authorization coupled but figure out some way to delegate authentication in one of the authentication providers in my auth manager to the client application. li ol  pemThis sounds promising until I realized that in the particular use case, its actually necessary that even my providing application not know the users credentials.emp  ol start2 liSeparate the resource server and make each consuming application responsible for providing an authorization server, and set those endpoints as part of the configuration when registering the consuming app with the resource provider.li ol  pemThis feels like an uncomfortable inversion of what is often desired when using authorizationcode grant types. It also would require any default authorization providers to be implemented by each consuming application.emp  ol start3 liSome kind of delegating authorization server that falls back to a default if a client hasnt provided endpoints for their own authorization server.li ol  pThis would probably be a good solution, but Im not sure how to do it the springsecurityoauth2 way or if Id have to implement a bunch of my own stuff.p  ol start4 liCreate a default auth server, and optionally allow consuming applications to point to whichever auth server they want.li ol  pemThis seems viable approach in that it offers lots of customization. My concern is, how do I enforce some kind of registry with the resource server If the auth server is the server that approves consuming applications, but I dont want to let any consuming application implement its own auth server, just some of them. Otherwise nontrusted clients could end up approving themselvesemp  pIn case this influences any guidance, my resource provider will need a fully inflated OAuth2Authentication object which contains user details and client details.p  pThis image mostly explains what Im talking about, except I want multiple authorization servers and want to leave it to the consuming application to decide which authorization server to point at. How could I check on the resourceserver side of things that the authorization server proxying the requests is an approved authorization serverp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8mBJA.png altle imagep  pstrongADDENDUMstrongp  pI took a look at the existing implementation thats being used for this custom authentication case and I guess were just reading a token off their session that gets set by their own login service and building their user each time off of that. This sort of customization is a problem in that were removing customizations from the provider side of things in favor of handling that in the consuming applications. So, Im looking for solutions so consuming apps can define their own authentication means, to the point of even providing users that the providing application doesnt persist which leads me to think it may need to be an entire auth server. p  pThat being said, this seems like a potentially unsustainable inverted model IMHO, the provider should be the maintainer of users and authorization, not the consuming apps. So, Ill probably recommend a more business oriented change.p
Negative 104797 pFirst post here. I have a bunch of xy data actually lats and longs, plotted the lines successfully with a scalar value for each line. Scalar values run between 0 and 0.5ish.

Negative 104797 pI am reasonably new to sysfs with respect to driver development and I seem to be observing some rather odd behavior.  To make a long story short, it seems that the kernel is not passing back complete structs to my callback.

Negative 104797 pGiven the option between using GPG and OpenSSL for local encryption before pushing archives to an offsite backup location, what are the benefits and drawbacks of each solutionp  pBackground I currently manage a server infrastructure based on Ubuntu 14.04.1 with all current patches applied as they become available.p  pAll of these systems are headless, automatically built using vetted preseeds and automation tools, and run in virtual machines via KVM on uniform Intelbased hardware.p  pWe have a preference for Ruby, but a stronger preference for doing things correctly. Because of both, weve chosen the backup gem as the means to create encrypted archives of data we want preserved, since it will create the same encrypted archives for a developer using Vagrant that it would in production, regardless of the mechanism by which its transmitted. p  pAll software and configuration is managed via Puppet, so neither decision will have any impact on user experience or convenience. Either option will create relevant scripts to manage, verify, or restore from any backups created. p  pGiven that, does either encryption option offer any advantage against the other when used for this purposep

However, about two weeks ago, after having not restarted any of my nodes for quite a while, I discovered that I now need a lot more attempts 20 in order to start a node. p  pFrom the stack trace, it looks like a timeout issue in doWaitForCore but I cannot find a setting to increase the amount of time that DSE would wait for a core to load during startup before giving up. The core that is mentioned in the stack trace is always the same, and I assume that this is because it is my biggest core 1.4 billions records and it takes the longest time to load. But when I manage to start the node successfully, there are no signs of errors  I can query the core like any other core.p  pp  pThere are two other issues that may or may not be related to the one above.

Negative 104797 pIve implemented a user matchmaking system a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15776955rediswatchmultiexecbyoneclientusing the info from this questiona with Redis for a game that needs to connect two users and start a game.p  pIt works like thisbr User A comes to the server and asks if there are any users searching. Because there are none he gets added to a Redis set data type with a key name of userssearching.  p  pUser B comes to the server and asks if there are any users searching. The userssearching key is read and because it finds User A searching the matchmaking ends and the match begins. During this, the ids of User A and User B are deleted from the userssearching set.p  pThis is the normal scenario. But the following could happenbr User C comes to the server and he asks if there are any usersbr  He got here before User B and will matchmake with User A and B will wait for another user.  He got here after User B and User A started the match and will just wait for another user.br  He got here exactly when User B found User A but the keys werent deleted from the userssearching set.

Asynchronous   operations may only be started within an asynchronous handler or   module or during certain events in the Page lifecycle. If this   exception occurred while executing a Page, ensure that the Page is   marked lt Page Asynctrue . This exception may also indicate an   attempt to call an async void method, which is generally unsupported   within ASP.NET request processing. Instead, the asynchronous method   should return a Task, and the caller should await it.p blockquote  pBased on this exception, it sounds like my codeSendMessagecode method probably needs to return a codeTaskcode. However, codeclient.SendAsynccode returns void so there doesnt appear to be any codeTaskcode to return or codeawaitcode.p

Negative 104797 pI am creating a numpy array between two limits with a step size of 0.005 using numpy.arange. Normally I would expect the output to go up to but not include the stop point.

Negative 104797 pI am trying to use the DailyMotion Embed API in order to play a video on iOS. I have disabled the chrome, because I have custom controls. This works perfectly fine on desktop and other mobile devices, but not on iOS. This has to do with iOS not allowing JS triggering of video playback.

Negative 104797 pI have a fat jar which uses java 8 features.I would like to use it with buildroot. But as I am reading on it for a couple of days, the jamvm version 2.0 supports java 8 and because of GNUClasspath limitations it we cant use any java 8.0 complaint jars in it. Is there a way to overcome this I also read that IcedTea can be used an alternative, but I am not sure how to install or build buildroot with IcedTea. Any pointers on this would be great. p  pThanks, Gp
Negative 104797 pI have this dreaded error when I run on the iPhone but not on the simulator. Ive tried running instruments for zombies, allocations and sudden terminations but the later will not run on a device. Nothing out of the ordinary is highlighted by these tools. Maybe Im using them wrongly but its seems pretty straight forward.p  pBasically I get this error when Ive added a 2nd set of data arrays to the app, and on the simulator it uses about 70MB whereas without the 2nd set it uses 20 to 40MB. It really looks like Im simply out of memory iPhone 4s but from what Ive read, thats not likely. From the allocations instrument, the last thing that happens is a VM allocation but I dont know if it was successful or anything. The instrument doesnt say anything much at all.p  pDoes anybody have a method for tracking down such a problem with Xcode 6 and running on the device My app is using ARC. Is there a debugger console command I should knowp  pThanksp  pPS Ive also enabled zombie objects in Xcode but also no clues about the error.p  pHere is the code I was asked to postp  precode  Process

Negative 104797 pI have a bash script sitting on a server and a Java app that will run on said server. My goal is to invoke this script, twice, from the Java app such that both will run concurrently.p  pI have the following codep  precodeRuntime runtime  Runtime.getRuntime Process process  runtime.execnew String[]  binbash, c, script.sh amp script.sh amp   codepre  pThis should invoke the script via bash, run it in the background, and then immediately set off another one before the first finishes the script takes about ten seconds to run. This all seems to work perfectly fine.p  pThe problem is, I then want to wait until both background processes have completed before moving on to the next line in my Java program. I tried thisp  precodeint exitValue  process.waitFor  next line of code codepre  pHowever, it seems that next line of code is running before both processes have really finished. I suspect that what is happening is that Java considers the process complete as soon as the second process is kicked off since they are both run in the background. My guess is that process.waitFor is really only good for tracking foreground processes.p  pI suppose one solution would be to make a temporary bash script that kicks off both processes in the background, run emthatem script in the foreground, and track its progress with process.waitFor. But I would really prefer not having to keep creating temporary scripts that call other scripts just so that it can run in the foreground. Ideally I would like invoke the background processes the way I am today and simply wait until they are all done. I dont know if this is possible.p

Negative 104797 pI have a msi installer, which after installation opens up configuration screen. Before I start configuring, I need to enter my login credentials.

One with red border is a windows pane, inside that is a web page where you can see a fields to enter credentials. When I see this using UISPY, I can see a URL in the value field when pointed inside the pane.p  pIf I use UI automation, it cannot detect the web page. If I use selenium it cannot detect windows screen. How do I handle this scenario. Any suggestion would be of great help.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDqBHf.png altenter image description herep

I need that any logging performed on server side to include, in the log line, the username which performs the action which generated the log statement.p  pIn standard Java EE application that was easy to do. Just implement a ServletFilter, get the username, set it on MDC and everything was fine because both the filter and the actual servlet processing was performed in the same thread.p  pIn JAXRS I cannot use a ContainerRequestFilter to do similar thing because, apparently the filter is executed in a different thread than the actual resource method called.p  pOne solution i found was to define an Interceptor, that intercepts all method calls on the resource classes and accessing the HttpServletRequest is getting the username and set it on MDC. p  precodepublic class LoggingInterceptor   Inject private Logger logger  AroundInvoke public Object methodInterceptorInvocationContext invocationContext throws Exception   int modifiers  invocationContext.getMethod.getModifiers String className  invocationContext.getTarget.getClass.getSimpleName String methodName  invocationContext.getMethod.getName if Modifier.isPublicmodifiers       configureLogginginvocationContext       log method start      if logger.isDebugEnabled      StringBuilder builder  new StringBuilder     builder.appendSTART      builder.appendclassName     builder.append.     builder.appendmethodName     builder.append  Arguments       Object[] parameters  invocationContext.getParameters     for Object parameter  parameters          builder.appendparameter  null  null  parameter.toString         builder.append            logger.debugbuilder.toString         Object result  invocationContext.proceed   log method end if Modifier.isPublicmodifiers ampamp logger.isDebugEnabled      StringBuilder builder  new StringBuilder     builder.appendEND      builder.appendclassName     builder.append.     builder.appendmethodName     builder.append  Returned       builder.appendresult     logger.debugbuilder.toString   return result   private void configureLoggingInvocationContext invocationContext   if REST class set user name in logging MDC if invocationContext.getTarget instanceof AgroMeteoResource      MDC.putuserName, anonymous     AgroMeteoResource agroMeteoResource  AgroMeteoResource invocationContext.getTarget     String authId  agroMeteoResource.getRequest.getHeaderAuthResource.PARAMAUTHID     if authId  null       put the user name in order to appear in the log files     MDC.putuserName, authId        codepre  pp  pHowever, I find this approach not very wellsuited quite primitive I might say  .

Negative 104797 pI have made a very simple thing in unity3d. A cube is in the main scene and I control it via accelerometer. Just that. Simple. Now when I build my project of iOS and run it on the device using default build player settings, it runs extremely extremely slow. I dont know whats the issue. Is it iPhone 4 As its an old device. Frame rate appears to be slow in the game. I havent checked the frame rate as of yet. But there is nothing at all in the scene except a mere cube. And Im using the free unity version. I checked out some other posts. They say its got something to do withp  blockquote   pApplication.tragetFrameRatep blockquote  pI also tried to set it to 60 in my scenes script but no gain. Some forums said that all iOS devices have vsync enabled and in that case .tragetFrameRate doesnt work.p  pI dont understand the issue plus Im a beginner on unity.p  pAny help would be highly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 104797 pIm developing a rather large website with which included a customer base and billing plans. The monthly billing should happen automatically however, an employee should, manually, click a button to initiate the process every month due to business rules and the number of customers are between 3000  5000. On every single invoice, the price lines should be calculated based on quite a lot of parameters and even external data from a webservice. p  pThe above will definitely be a very long running task and since the application is an ASP.NET MVC website running on IIS, I dont want the process to run in its own thread on IIS. My concerns are that if anything happens to IISthe webserver, the billing calculation process stops aswell, which would be critical, to say the least.p  pTherefore Im looking for alternatives and have read about creating a Windows Service for tasks like this. Is this the way to go Or is there other, maybe more modern ways of running long processes The process has to able to be started from the ASP.NET MVC application though.p  pAny helphint is greatly appreciated p

Negative 104797 pI have no idea if this is the most efficient way of doing what Im trying to do, if isnt by all means tell me. p  pIm building a chrome extension that is supposed to loop through each word on the page, and then compare it to a list of 12,000 elements in an array. I managed to make it work on the content script page, but to my dismay, it takes about 7 seconds to load my content script because of all the looping that is taking place. This isnt ideal, obviously. So I had the idea of sending all the codepcode tags to the background page, where it then compares the codepcode words to the array, and once it figures out which match, it sends a message back to the content script with a smaller array of just the words that are located both in the codepcode tags and in my array. p  pNow my question is, is this possible Will it reduce the load time Is this efficient p  pOne final question My manifest is using a background page in the form of codehtmlcode but if I wanted to also use a background script Google doesnt allow that, so can I place my background script in the background page codehtmlcode file and will it load that scriptp

Negative 104797 pThe a hrefhttpscode.google.compaparapi relnofollowAPARAPI projecta describes itself asp  blockquote   pAparapi allows Java developers to take advantage of the compute power of GPU and APU devices by executing data parallel code fragments on the GPU rather than being confined to the local CPU. It does this by converting Java bytecode to OpenCL at runtime and executing on the GPU...p blockquote  pIm wondering what benefit this offers over traditional concurrency frameworks such as a hrefhttpsgithub.comGParsGPars relnofollowgparsa or a hrefhttpakka.io relnofollowAkkaa.p  pUnder what circumstances would converting JVM bytecode to OpenCL be faster or more preferable to what these alternatives offer Why is the OpenCLGPU paradigm faster at least under certain circumstances than JavaCPU What circumstances would warrant doing thisp
Negative 104797 pI would like to add content textpicture thumbnails to an area on the middle of my HTML page. This area currently has Paragraph of text repeated throughout. Id like it so that the DIV tags on the bottom could move down as the one middle DIV expands in size. It would also be nice if the two DIVs along either side of the middle could expand to the same height. Is this possible without manually changing all of the top and left propertiesp  pCurrently, I put a scroll bar in the page so that you can view all of the text. Id like to remove that scroll bar and have the page height expand as necessary when I add content. I know that the absolute positioning is screwing me up, however I adapted this page from other pages on my website that are a set size. Im sure its considered bad page design...p  pHere is the sample page live on my website a hrefhttpenvyblade.xoom.itswtorsample.html relnofollowhttpenvyblade.xoom.itswtorsample.htmlap  pUpdate I removed all of my heights and absolute positioning of all my sub DIVs. I then went and added in box shadowing. I had to resize a few things so it would look similar. This is what I get. Its not as perfect yet a hrefhttpenvyblade.xoom.itswtorsample2.html relnofollowhttpenvyblade.xoom.itswtorsample2.htmlap  pThe two images wont center between the top and bottom shadow boxes like they did when I was using images. And it would nice to see the bottom boxs shadow instead of the page just ending.p  pHTMLp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtSample Pagelttitlegt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetiso88591gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefsample.cssgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv classMainboxgt      ltdiv classSlice07gt         ltimg srcimagesSlice07.jpg width1024 height25 altgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classSlice08gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classSlice11gt         lth1gtSample Pagelth1gt         ltdivgt     ltdiv classSlice13gt     ltpgt         Paragraph of text.

Negative 104797 pIm writing a code to solve for a root in a nonlinear, one variable equation. The root has to be in the range of 0 to 1.

Ive tried codescipy.optimize.brentqcode, but I cant figure out how to use it.p  precodefrom sympy import Symbol, solve def findintersectionA, eV     x  Symbolx     y  Symboly     y  0.18x  5.87  A0.02x0.42     tempx  solve1.35x1.4y0.33xy0.7580.28xy1y0.1010.109yx1xeV, x     for value in tempx         if valuegt0 and valuelt1             permxvalue     return permx codepre
Negative 104797 pI have a production and local DJANGO development environment. To push things to production we have a deployer which minifies and gzips all CSS and JS files. p  pTo serve them on production I need to call them like p  precode  ltlink relstylesheet href STATICURL cssfilename.min.css.gzgt codepre  pHowever on development I want the normal css file served that way I dont have to reminify and gzip each time I save with p  precode  ltlink relstylesheet href STATICURL cssfilename.cssgt codepre  pIs there any way to achieve and automatize this behaviour by adding something to the deployer, is there some other workaround I could get rid of the .min extension if its possible to add the .gz in a clean way p  pI want to note the I know I could implement some htmlparser which adds it on each deploy but Im looking for a neat and django oriented solution.p

Negative 104797 pI need help troubleshooting some JQuery code that breaks when a user changes muscle groups by clicking on an image map in my Rails 4 application.  Some background  The image map is of the human muscular system. The target muscle groups and strength exercises are in separate dropdown menus, which work okay. The hotspots on the image map also work okay.p  pMy goal is to improve user experience by letting users click hotspots on the image map to choose target muscle groups. Im using JQuery to filter option elements by optgroup. For example, if a user clicks the abs region on the image map, the first dropdown menu should indicate the users muscle group selection, and the second dropdown menu should populate with absrelated exercises.  My JQuery works okay until a user changes muscle groups by clicking the image map.  Thats when the exercise dropdown menu stops populating.p  pForm fields for dropdown menusp  precodeltdiv classfieldgt   lt f.label musclegroup gtltbr gt   lt f.collectionselect musclegroupid, MuscleGroup.ordername, id, name, prompt Choose your target muscles, includeblank false gt ltdivgt ltdiv classfieldgt   lt f.label strengthexercise gtltbr gt   lt f.groupedcollectionselect strengthtraininglistid, MuscleGroup.ordername, strengthtraininglists, name, id, name, includeblank true gt ltdivgt codepre  pThe rendered HTML for dropdown menusp  precodeltdiv classfieldgt   ltlabel classstring required forstrengthexercisemusclegroupgtltabbr titlerequiredgtltabbrgt Muscle groupltlabelgtltbrgt   ltselect idstrengthexercisemusclegroupid namestrengthexercise[musclegroupid]gtltoption valuegtChoose your target musclesltoptiongt   ltoption selectedselected value11gtAbs  rectus abdominisltoptiongt ltdivgt  ltdiv classfieldgt   ltlabel classstring optional forstrengthexercisestrengthexercisegtStrength exerciseltlabelgtltbr gt   ltselect idstrengthexercisestrengthtraininglistid namestrengthexercise[strengthtraininglistid]gtltoption valuegtltoptiongt   ltoptgroup labelAbs  rectus abdominisgt   ltoption value5gtLying Leg Raiseltoptiongt   ltoption value6gtKneeling Front Pull Downltoptiongt   ltoption value15gtBicycleltoptiongt   ltoption value24gtAb Rolloutltoptiongt    more option values ...   ltoptgroupgt   ltselectgt    ltdivgt codepre  pJQuery codep  precodedocument.readyfunction        mapabs.clickfunction         var absID  11         var musclegroup  strengthexercisemusclegroupid option[value  absID  ].attrselected,selected         var strengthtraininglists  strengthexercisestrengthtraininglistid.html         var options         var musclegroupselected  strengthexercisemusclegroupid selected.text         options  strengthtraininglists.filteroptgroup [label  musclegroupselected  ].html         console.logoptions           if options            strengthexercisestrengthtraininglistid.htmloptions             return strengthexercisestrengthtraininglistid.parent.show           else              strengthexercisestrengthtraininglistid.empty             return strengthexercisestrengthtraininglistid.parent.hide                  end click function     end ready codepre  pThis is what happens after the page loadsp  pIf a user clicks on the abs hotspot, the first dropdown menu correctly indicates that abs is the selected option for the muscle group. The second dropdown menu correctly populates with abs related strength exercises.  This is the desired behavior anytime a user clicks a hotspot.p  pThis is what happens if a user uses the image map to change from one muscle group to another onep  pMy JQuery code breaks on the change.  If a user uses the image map to change  from one muscle group to another, say from abs to biceps, the first dropdown menu correctly changes to indicate biceps is the newly selected option, but the second dropdown menu disappears.  No biceps exercises are shown.  In the console, the variable named options is undefined after the attempted change.  The options variable is empty, because of the break in my codes logic.p  pThe following behavior is what I want to see whenever a user clicks the image map to change muscle groupsp  pa  the first dropdown menu should indicate the new muscle group selected, and b  the second dropdown menu should populate with exercises that target the new muscle group.p  pMy thought is to bind a JQuery change event to the selector strengthexercisemusclegroupid to deal with when a user changes muscle groups. Something likep  precodestrengthexercisemusclegroupid.changefunction   code to address what happens when user changes muscle groups    codepre  pHowever, Im new to Jquery and confused about how to do this, in particular  the syntax and where to place such a function if that is indeed what I really need to fix my code.

Negative 104797 pI am writing a node app with various communities and within those communities users are able to create and join roomslobbies.  I have written the logic for these lobbies into the node app itself though a collection of lobby objects.p  pLobbies require some maintenance once created.  Users can change various statuses within the lobby and I also have calls using socket.io at regular intervalsabout every 2 seconds for each lobby to keep track of some user input live.p  pNone of the tasks are too cpu intensive.  The biggest potential threat I foresee is a load distributing algorithm but it is not one of the live calls and is only activated upon a button press by the lobby creator it also is never performed on more than 10 things.p  pMy concern arises in that, in production, if the server starts to get close too around 100200 lobbies I could be risking blocking the event loop.  Are my concerns reasonable  Is the potential quantity of these operations, although they are small, large enough to warent offloading this code to a separate executable or getting involved with various frankenthread javascript libsp  pstrongemTLDRemstrong node app has object with regular small tasks run.  Should I worry about eventloop blocking if many of these objects are made.p

Negative 104797 pMy app allows users to put some custom XAML markup into a textbox. When my app loads I use XamlReader.Parse to load the tree. I then overwrite some Resources in my MergedDictionaries with these custom resources.p  pThis has worked well and I can catch the XamlParseException when a user has entered invalid Xaml. The problem comes when a user types in an incorrect attribute value like the Color of a Border. If they type in Grey instead of Gray, there are no exceptions and the UI just fails to display. In fact it appears like the app has frozen.p  pThis problem can also be replicated in the VS Designer. Just type in an incorrect Color value ignore Intellisense. There will be no warnings in VS.p  pAre there any ways to catch this incorrect attribute valuep
