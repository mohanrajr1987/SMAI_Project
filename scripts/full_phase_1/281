Positive 281 pIm working on a task where I need to make multiple request to an HTTPS url from my java program and read the response.

Negative 281 pHi everybody on stackoverflow.p  h1SHORT VERSION h1  pI need to use x,y,z acceleration values related only to the movement of the iPhone. Just to be clear, think an environment like a car. The iPhones accelerometer is very sensitive. If I log acceleration values with a frequency of 100Hz, there are so many values related to noise, car vibrations and other acceleration vectors which are not directed like the iPhone motion for example, dampers oscillations cause acceleration vectors directed along zaxis.p  pIn other words, I need to filter accelerations detection in a way capable to isolate accelerations whose direction is the same within a certain offset of the motion direction.p  h1DEEPER CONSIDERATIONS h1  pObviously, I could fix the iphone position so that its y axis overlaps the movement direction in the previous car environment, this means fixing the iphone y axis parallel to the front direction. The problem is that I need to allow iphones relative moments. I cant fix the iphone position.p  pFirst of all I analyzed values produced by noise and oscillations, and I figured out that their magnitude is often very higher than normal car accelerations. Filtering the magnitude is a good idea to ease the problem but its not a solution on one side many unwanted noise accelerations are not filtered because their magnitude falls within the range, on the other side many wanted motion accelerations are filtered because they falls outside the range.p  pOn the iPhone 3GS I can use the magnetometer to measure degrees heading relative to magnetic North. I could use this to find the direction of motion but the problem is still there  magneticHeading value is always measured relative to the top of the device. So the iPhone should be fixed along the front direction.p  pI cant think any other solution. Ideas Tank youp

Negative 281 pbr I am working on a project written in C which involves modification of existing code. The code uses object oriented principlesdesign patterns heavily and also complicated stuff like smart pointers.br While trying to understand the code using codegdbcode,I had to be very careful about the various polymorphic functions being called by the various subclasses.p  pEveryone knows that the intent of using design patterns and other complicated stuff in your code is to make it more reusable i.e maintainable but I personally feel that, it is much easier to understand and debug a procedure oriented code as you definitely know which function will actually be called. p  pAny insights or tips to handle such situations is greatly appreciated.p  pP.S I am relatively less experienced with OOP and large projects.p

Negative 281 pIm working on a public release if a model using Fortran 9x and Id like to design the code to support both static or dynamic memory management.p  pIve only seen one example of a code that supports something like this. It is implemented using preprocessors that look something like thisp  pThe code would include some memory management control file with the followingp  precodeifdef STATIC   define NMEM N   define PTR       blank else   define NMEM    define PTR ,pointer codepre  pThe user supplies the following file to configure static memoryp  precodedefine N 100       Example array size define STATIC codepre  pIn the core code, you declare your variable as suchp  precodereal PTR, dimensionNMEM  x codepre  pSet STATIC during compilation, and it becomesp  precodereal, dimension100  x codepre  pUnset STATIC implicitly setting it to dynamic and it becomesp  precodereal, pointer, dimension  x codepre  pand some later code allocates the memory.p  pThis works perfectly fine, but I like to avoid using preprocessors if I can, and it does feel like a kludge to me. Is there a more standard solution to this problem, or is this how it is normally handled Is there even much difference between static and dynamic compilations these days keeping in mind that I will probably want to use as much memory as I canp

Negative 281 pIm a little confused about the flow in a system using domain events to build the read model.  Particularly, how do we deal with the fact that the user expects data and its view to change when they complete a command, but due to our system architecture nonblocking calls to publish events the actual database might not change before the page is reloadedp  pIm hoping to move the design of one of our systems more inline with CQRS using events and a service bus.p  pLets say my flow goes as suchp  ol lipUser clicks button in View to perform Task of removing Payment Method from their Account.pli lipController calls PaymentMethodRemovalService, passing it accountId amp paymentMethodId.pli lipController uses AccountRepository to retrieve Account and calls account.RemovePaymentMethodidpli lipAccount validates that operation can occur and publishes event PaymentMethodRemovedMessageaccountId, paymentMethodIdpli lipBecause event publishing is asynchronous, we now have to return from service and return view from the controller  strongbut our actual data isnt updated yetstrongpli lipA handler, IHandlelt PaymentMethodRemovedMessage , hears the event and removes the actual row from the DBpli ol  pSo, whats a guy to dop  pI could simply, say, remove the div that was displaying the payment method.  This may work in an AJAX scenario, but what if Im using PostRedirectGet to support nonJavaScript clients.  Then I will be firing my Get and reading the data from the Query side of things, potentially before its updated.p  pDo I just show a notification saying their request to remove the payment method has been submitted  which doesnt seem to friendly, makes sense for submitting an order, but not for, say, changing an address.p  pstrongIs there a way to reconcile implementing changes as decoupled asynchronous events and showing the user data that reflects their current changestrongp  pEDIT  My question is quite similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3380431cqrsdddsynchingreportingdatabasehttpstackoverflow.comquestions3380431cqrsdddsynchingreportingdatabasea  I have to say, the answer given there and also alluded to here, has a bit of a smell to it  wrangling the UI to show an update thats out of band with the read DB, so to speak.

Negative 281 pGood evening,everyonep  pIm sorry if this sounds like a silly question, but I have not been able to find the answer I am looking for otherwise.  I am writing an command line application in C and from within the program, I would like to call other commandline applications.  For example and only as a clear example, say the I would like to write a C app that calls the java compiler.  For one, how would I do this  Is there a C function that directly calls the command line of something  For two, how would I take the normal text output that the java compiler displays and display it through the c programp  pIm sorry if this sounds a bit crazy, but I am very new to C and I have never done anything like this before.  I would love to start writing a few of these utility style apps.  If it matters any, I am currently running Windows, but would prefer a platformindependent method if possible, as I do use Linux from time to time.p  pThanksp

Negative 281 pI am trying to solve a small issue. I have built an entire web ASP.NET application using mostly client side JQueryJavaScript code.

Therefore I would be sending a string to my server with the filename, not an array of bytes.p  pAny thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated p
Negative 281 pI have a Mac client application written in ObjectiveC that presents the user with a list of html documents in a table, and when the user clicks on a row it loads the selected HTML page into a WebView.p  pEvery HTML page has a listener on click that calls an ObjectiveC method.p  pWhen the application runs and the user clicks on the first row, everything works fine. The click event is trapped, and my ObjectiveC method is successfully called.p  pHowever, when the user clicks on a second or subsequent record and then a new HTML page is loaded in to the same WebView the listener on click never fires.p  pIf the selected record is the first to be loaded it always works fine, so the problem is not one of bad HTML files. FYI, all files are largely identical.p  pIve boiled the problem down in a simple test application. It can be downloaded here  a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu160638WorkTCLMapTest2.zip relnofollowhttpdl.dropbox.comu160638WorkTCLMapTest2.zipap  pNOTE The test application outputs a message to the standard log, so you will need to check either the log window in Xcode or Console.app to see the ObjectiveC method call working or not. The buttons along the top are in pairs, loading first from a local file, then an HTML page as a string, then pulling an HTML page from a web site.p  pFrom extensive searching Im guessing that when I load the second HTML page into the WebView the previous page is retained somehow, and the two listeners on click are clashing in some way Is that possiblep  pCan anyone recommend a way to load HTML pages such that subsequent loads will work Is there a way to ensure that any pages previously loaded into a WebView are fully unloaded before I load the second pagep  pAny suggestions you could make would be appreciated.p  pRegardsp  pDarren.p

Does anyone have an example of how to do thisp  pstrongEdit Response to Commentsstrongp  pThank you all for the comments  here is the additional information requestedp  pThe exception is thrown from the codeforeachcode statement.  Specifically, when stepping through the code it thrown in the step after when codeincode is highlighted.  It seems that I was able to create the event log object but Im not able to access the entries in the event log.p  pMy account does not have permission to read the event log on the target system, but I have credentials for an account which does.  When connecting manually through the event viewer there is an option to connect as another user.  After doing this manually, then my code ran without a problem.  However, I cannot rely doing it manually every time this program runs.  What I need is a way to connect as another user programmaticly.  I thought that the codeEventLogPermissioncode would be the way to do that, but maybe there is another way.  If anyone knows how to connect to a remote log as a different user in C, that would be exactly what I was looking for.p

Negative 281 pIn an existing project, I see a class Vector3d, templated, with the usual operations for vectors in the sense of algebra. After profiling, I noticed that a large amount of the time is spent in this class. p  pI was wondering if there was a wellknown implementation of such a basic concept as a 3d vector in C. Indeed, it might be easier to use a good implementation of the vector instead of trying to optimize this one. p  pEdit This is in a context of a geometrical representation of some objects. But it is independent from any visualization. I will see if there is a way of avoiding to call the various methods too often. And I will have a look at the proposed packages.p

Negative 281 pOk, so I found some rather weird behaviour while messing around with the WPF ProgressBar control. This control is located in a column of a ListView control and the general situation differs little from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5929199makeprogressbartakeavailablespace59294965929496this question amp answera in its essence.p  pI bind codeProgressbarcode to a class by means of several properties codeMincode, codeMaxcode, codeValuecode, all OneWay Bindings obviously. This other class is updated from another thread and regularly uses the codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode interface to let the ProgressBar know the status is progressing. And this all works just greatp  pBut here is where it gets odd. My ProgressBar loses its glow.. right upto the moment it reaches the codeMaxcode 100 value. Then it suddenly starts pulsing its white glowy stuff all over the green bar, and this is very annoying. I am showing progress with a reason, and the lack of a pulse is actually pretty distracting once you start to notice it not being there.p  pThus, I set off to debug. I found that with codeThread.Sleep1000code in my threads processing, it still hid the glow, but if I bump it to codeThread.Sleep1500code the glow comes back at all times with a crazy vigour. After that, I tried translating my progress units to smaller numbers so the integer values would take longer to change. Min 0, Max 100 still has the lack of the glow. Min 0, Max 10 had the glow come back in its full vigor. In all cases, it is the same amount of work and time spent to reach 100, but it is a very visible binary YESNO effect with regards to the glow showing. The only thing I have not tested is whether it also happens when the ProgressBar is not placed inside of this ListView control.p  pI know myself well enough that I cant make sense of the deep WPF innards of the XAML involved with the ProgressBar control. So I was hoping anyone here knows whether this is a known bug, something they stumbled into, or something they might even know how to work aroundfix.p  pMy machine runs Windows 7, and Im developing in VS2010 targeting  .NET Framework 4 Client Profile.p

Negative 281 pI have a ListView which is layout below a header bar and layout above a footer bar. Each row of the ListView contains a LinearLayout with a CheckBox and TextView side by side.

Negative 281 pIm trying to build an user loginauthentication client for a RESTful webservice created by me.  However, while trying to setup authentication using the authentication APIs available JAXRS, I had some troubles and decided to change the approach.

This message body will then be encrypted using the RSA algorithm in the client using some JavaScript lib and decrypted on the server side.p  pThe problem is I used Java to generate the PublicKey, and they are stored as an base64 string, encoded using X509 padding.p  pHow can I decode this encoded string, which represents the Public Key, using only JavaScript, and actually use it to encrypt some textp  pthanks in advance p

Negative 281 pI have few ideas where im not sure if Im correct and if my approach is correct. The situation is that I got some backend servers which exposes REST of course stateless interface and expects usage of HTTP authentication via its headers. Then I have some its clients and one of them is web server which has loaded web application that is accessed by typical web browser using SSL. User via web browser enters his credentials username and password, which are sent to web server and here comes the thing I want to ask. Web server will delegate all the requests to backend server REST putting those credentials to HTTP headers. Is it safe to store those credentials within HTTP session between web server and browser And if not, where to store them otherwisep  pThanksp

Negative 281 pIve searched in google and android develop site about the issue that the  sampling rate of the touch event is too low. However, most of the information  obtained is in opposite side. Many docs discuss about that the sampling rate is  too high such that it causes game programming to slow down the frame rate.  Its said that this is fixed in some android version. p  pNow I come up with the problem. I desired to develop a handwriting note app  which requires the touch event handling. I noticed that the touch event triggered or to said, captured in onTouch function is not as frequently as I want. It seems only tens of touch events captured in onTouch and the points are not enough to make a smooth handwriting. p  pDoes anyone knows how to increase the sampling rate of the touch event I wonder  whether this is a hardware issue or because of android framework may filter some of the  event. Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks....p  pBRp  pYiJup

After looking at several tutorials on ajax upload that each refer to the AjaxUpload.js plugin and getting absolutely bubkis because on his page, it is not named AjaxUpload.js, it is name something else.  If it is even there at all.  I didnt feel like going through the hassle of renaming it, and just freaking seeing what happens, because that usually just results in an ugly orgy of errors on obsenities.  p  pC  Alot of the solutions appear to use CAKE.  Not really sure what the hell that is, but it looks like some kind of PHP design pattern based off of the popular MVC design pattern.  Not really sure though.  p  pD this appears to be a really hard task.  Not something that would take a couple of lines of code and prayer.br   D1 The PHP code seems simple enough.

On the other hand, when the user taps on LinearLayout1, only the background of LinearLayout1 should be changed. But now when the user taps on either of both LinearLayouts, both of them change their background.p  pThe behaviour on tap on LinearLayout2 should be as onListItemClick while when the user taps on LinearLayout1 a Dialog should appear if this matters.p  pAny ideas how could I solve the background change issue Ive tried playing with focusable and clickable options. If i set clickabletrue to both LinearLayouts, the children TextViews of LinearLayout2 do not change their colour the TextViews should change their text colour.p  pThank youp

Negative 281 pThe issue I am facing is an interesting one and my knowledge of security is strong, but my understanding is weak. That is, I understand the theory, but have had little practical application in this particular regard. I have stored passwords, transmitted them using salt, verified them a hash, etc. My needs here are similar but specific.p  pI have one application that other external application may hook into via a ContentProvider URI. External applications may be developed by anyone, thus I do not have control over them. However, I want to limit some access to subscribers. To facilitate this, each subscribed application will have a key registered to its package name. The ContentProvider then needs to verify this key as valid.p  pMy issue is this Since it is passed via URI, it is easily possible to intercept the key in transit. Additionally, my subscribers need a method by which they can store their own key without having to connect to a secure server. They cannot store the key as a literal within their app, of course, as this makes for easy vulnerability. I am trying to provide as much of a solution as possible without having to trust the security of these other applications. p  pSo, how do we store a key in both my database and their external application, and allow them to send it to me for specifically verified queries I think my issue in understanding how to do this is the aspect of persistent storage and how it affects the model. That is, with a password model, the password is typed and not typically stored.p  pFuzzicalLogicp

Negative 281 pOk guys, here is my question.br I would use CoreData  Source List  NSTreeController to create something similar to the source list of Finder or iTunes if you prefer.br My problem is that what I have in my source list doesnt come entirely from CoreData. For example I have a section root called data from core data that is populated using CoreData, but I also have some fake sections i.e. Favorites section that are created runtime.br For this reason I think that binding the OutlineView and the NSTreeController directly to CoreData using entities is not feasible and that I have to use something intermediate like a NSMutableArray that I populate at start with data coming from CoreData and the fake sections using adhoc classes for the members like in the SourceView example by Apple. This is the first question 1 Am I right in doing thisbr My second question is about this NSMutableArray. Lets say that using this array could be a solution, I was wondering which is the correct way to fill the array in. In the example SourceView the intermediate array is populated runtime using the NSTreeController insertObject, but another solution I was thinking of is subclassing NSMutableArray and change directly the content of the array. 2 Am I breaking the MVC in this wayp

Since the jobs mostly use bulk statements to run the updates, we have run into blocking locks several times now, having to kill single jobs to allow others to run through.p  pstrongWhat are good ways to prevent jobs from colliding with each otherstrongp  pI am thinking about things likep  ul lisetting up a metajob which knows about dependencies and coordinates the dependent jobsli licreating schedules which keep conflicting jobs as separate as possibleli licoordinating jobs with the third parties to prevent conflicts between external and internal jobsli linot using bulk statements updating everything at once with a single codeMERGEcode or codeUPDATEcode but instead update one by one committing the intermediate resultsli ul  pEspecially the last option seems a plausible approach to me in order to reduce the probability of blocking locks. But I know that performance suffers a lot when I switch our jobs from bulk updates to looping over cursors.p
Negative 281 pIve never actually come across this before... Ive been creating a jQuery slider, its set up in the following wayp  pI have a viewport div  thats 500px wide and has its overflow set to hidden. Then inside that it has another div that is 1000px wide. Then finally inside of that all the thumb divs which are floated left and have border AND outlines assigned to them. Then of course Ive got the jQuery buttons which animate it left and right etc, its nothing fancy but it all works properly.p  pHowever the outline on the thumb divs which are outside the the view port are still showing, everything else is hidden properly but for some reason the outlines still appear, its as if they ignore the overflow hidden properties of the viewport.p  pIve mocked up a basic example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netK4BXb relnofollowherea, without all the jQuery but just to show you what I mean and in this example overflow is set to scroll not hidden, but it still gets the same outcome.p  pIs this normal behaviour for Opera Ive tested it in Chrome, FF, and IE and it all works okay, just a bit confused by the matterp  pI know I could always use one outer thumb div with a border then an inner thumb div, or even a bg image or something but I want to try and solve it properly if I can.p  pAny idea what it could bep

Negative 281 pIm using google DFP.p  pIf I use synchronous ads from google, my site loads slowly as it needs to load the ad at the same time it loads the website, and if an ad takes long to respond, then the load of the page gets paused.p  pIf I use asynchronous ads, this is not a problem since the page will load wether or not ads are loaded. In other words, it makes the site load faster. The thing is, using asynchronous ads creates a div with fixed width and height no matter if there are ads displaying or not. So usually this creates a lot of blank space on my site, since not all ads position are being used. Same goes with synchronous ads.p  pGoogle offers a third choice that doesnt create a div, it just uses javascript to display ads, and if there arent any ads publishing in that space, then it just doesnt display any blank space, which is good, however it behaves synchronously...p  pWhat I want is some method to use asynchronous ads and not get blank spaces in case no ad is publishing.p  pThanks.p

Negative 281 pFirst of all let me apologize in advance for what is my very first question posted on stack overflow and probably a quite stupid one.p  pSince a Map in scala is instantiated using the following syntaxp  precodeval myMapMap1gtvalue1,2gtvalue2 codepre  pI was expecting the Map object from codescala.collection.immutablecode to provide an codeapplycode method with a signature roughly looking likep  precodedef apply[A,B]entries A,BMap[A,B] codepre  pObviously I should be blind, but I cant find such a method. Where is it defined p  pFurthermore, could someone give me information about the purpose of the codeMap1code, codeMap2code, codeMap3code, codeMap4code classes defined in the codeMapcode object  Should they be used by the developer or are they only used internally by the language andor the compiler  Are they related somehow to the map instantiation scheme i was asking about above p  pThanks in advance for your help.  p
Negative 281 pI want to adddisplay data from querying from the database and add it into an XML file. Example, I have a tablepersons which has a name and age. I create a mysql query to get its name and age. Then simply put the dataname and age of persons into an XML file.p  pHow would you do that Or is it possiblep
Negative 281 pIn Java, all variables containing proper objects are actually references i.e. pointers. Therefore, method calls with these objects as arguments are always by reference. Calling a method which modifies the state of the object also affects the original object on the caller side.p  pC is different Here arguments can be passed by value or passed by reference. Calling a mutator method on an object which was passed by value leaves the original object unaffected. I suppose call by value creates a local copy of the object.p  pSo my first response to this  coming from Java to C  is ALWAYS use pointers when using objects as arguments. This gives me the behavior I have come to expect from Java.p  pHowever, one could also use call by value in case one does not need to modify the object in the method body. Are there reasons why one would want to do thisp

As the OS is running out of memory, is it not putting pressure on the CLR to release the memoryp  pHowever and even more confusing, if we wait until the task has completed, then hit enter to run the task again the memory is released, so obviously the previous dictionary has been garbage collected hasnt it.p  pSo, why is the memory not being released And how can we get the CLR to release the memory p  pAny explanations or solutions would be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT Following replies, particularly Beskas, it is obvious my description of the issue is not the the clearest, so I will try to clarify.p  pThe code may not be the best example, sorry It was a quick crude piece of code to try to replicate the issue.p  pThe dictionary is used here to replicate the fact we have a large custom data object, which fills a large chunk of our memory and it is not then released after the task has completed.p  pIn the example, the dictionary fills up to the limit of the dictionary and then throws an exception, it does NOT keep filling forever This is well before our memory is full, and it does not cause an OutOfMemoryException. Hence the result is a large object in memory, and then the task completes.p  pAt this point we would expect the dictionary to be out of scope, as both the task and the method Method have completed. Hence, we would expect the dictionary to be garbage collected and the memory reclaimed. In reality, the memory is not freed until Method is called again, creating a new WasteOfMemory instance and starting a new task.p  pHopefully that will clarify the issue a bitp

I dont really have any clear idea how to sort out relevant content based on all these numbers and the research terms. p  pSomething that I plan on doing is a search result page with multiple tabs, one there it would show all the results of the search and then in other tabs it would be separated in articlesphotosvideos.p  pI have no idea if Im actually on the right path to get something working.

Negative 281 pIn a rather complex HTML5 webapp that I am creating I find that it is handy to add a few custom attributes to some document elements.  With jQuery I find that I can retrieve such attributes without any issues  in Chrome, Safari and Firefox thus far and, I hope, also on the AndroidiPhone mobile browsers.p  pQuestion  is such usage, injecting custom attributes, ok or will I be breaking something down the line.  To get things into context I am using jQuery Mobile, with jQuery and a few jQuery plugins.p  pOn a related note I assume it is possible to retrieve all elements with a specified attribute with jQueryp
Negative 281 papologies in advance, I am still an Installshield newbie p  pI am currently using installsheild 2010 for an isntall packed for my application ds2. My trouble is I need to remove a previous incarnation of that project which was created with an installshield 2008 as a merge module ds1, not a installer in its own right.p  pSo the old version  ds1 is currently lacking in upgrade code etc, and only has access to a Product Version and Package code.p  pThe new program has the usuall Upgrade, package, product codes ds2.p  pIs there anyway to either associate the old product mergeModule to the new application so it can be uninstalled as a previous version. Or is there another method where i can ask installshield to remove anything with product code xxxxxxxxp  pI hope thats clear enough for a response Thanks in advancep
Negative 281 pIm handling errors using the code[HandleError]code attribute from within an MVC3 application.

The reason for adding this here is that it seems like a good catchall without any custom code. The existingResponsestrongReplacestrong is required, other modes result in 404s not being handled.p  pThe problem is that when existingResponseReplace the CustomErrors not longer functions. It just returns a stripped 500 error without details.p  pAre these two modes just mutually exclusive I am aware that I can code other 404 solutions, but ideally Id like this simple config change to work or understand why it just cant be done.p

Negative 281 pI have a ASP.NET MVC website and I would like to profile all the method calls including Javascript which get invoked on a specific user action on a web page button click for example.

The event is handled by the Javascript first which makes an Ajax call to the server, gets back the response and does something with it. There is a lot going on both on the client and on the server when this event fires, so looking for profiler to show the root cause of the problem, instead of manually debugging and stepping through every single method.p
Negative 281 pWe have to create rather large Ruby on Rails application based on large database. This database is updated daily, each table has about 500 000 records or more and this number will grow over time. We will also have to provide proper versioning of all data along with referential integrity.

In that case the root controller does not run dealloc, neither do the other two controllers when the root controller is replaced with a new controller. As expected. I was thinking that given this scenario, there should be some way for me to determine whether that root controller did actually deallocate or not.p  pstrongPossible Solutionstrong I did assign the tobereplaced root controller to a zeroing weak property on a global object shortly before replacing the controller. Then I have setup a timer so that after a fraction of a second I check if the property is nil or not. If its nil, the controller did deallocate. If its not nil, it probably indicates a memory leak likely to have been caused by a retain cycle somewhere in the hierarchy. In that case I print a log statement for as long as the replaced controller is not nil to get the developers attention.p  pThis works, but are there any alternative better solutions Or possible caveats with this solution p  pSpecifically, how much time can pass before the object deallocates  is this guaranteed to be instantaneous or can deallocation be delayed and if so, for how longp

Negative 281 pI used to be a senior tech service side and have just a little current programming knowledge, so please forgive me if I missed something obvious about the issue. Here goes  I uploaded my second mix to Soundcloud yesterday, and added the artwork in while in was still on the loadingencoding screen. The upload went smoothly and I filled in all the data for the track, and the artwork had loaded properly here a hrefhttpsoundcloud.comdvjrickkraftrickkraft012013electro relnofollowhttpsoundcloud.comdvjrickkraftrickkraft012013electroap  pI tried sharing to Facebook after that, but I was getting the default Soundcloud JPG. As per your suggestion and previous experience, I ran the link through the Facebook debug lint bar, which showed me the page scrape still shows the Soundcloud default when doing a page scrape. I had a similar issue with Mixcloud before when Facebook cached an image before I had set the correct one, ran debuglint and saw the fresh scrape with all correct information, and it began pulling in the right data.p  pI also tried variations 1 123 2 through the debug hadnt tried them previously so they wouldnt have been cached with each pulling the default Soundcloud JPG and not my art.p  pIn addition... the same day I uploaded a previous track here a hrefhttpsoundcloud.comdvjrickkraftrickkraft120505 relnofollowhttpsoundcloud.comdvjrickkraftrickkraft120505a which seems to have been replaced by my shared Jump Smokers track. I didnt delete it, and am at a loss for words as to how it disappeared... I wanted to test to see if Facebook pulls in the art for the first upload, but Ill have to reupload at the end of this current promo period. I realize this is likely a separate issue to report.p  pAny help you can suggest that I can do or your Dev team can do to resolve this would be greatly appreciated. Im right on the edge of my big breakthrough here as an artist in Taiwan and every lit bit really really counts. Sincerely, Rick Kraftp

Has anyone got the same problem before or has any idea to fix thisp  pBest.p

Negative 281 pI was not sure which SE site to pick  stackoverflow and math were the candidates  but as we might write a piece of software for this problem I decided to post it here.p  pIn our climbing gym, were facing the problem that adjacent wall sectors may not use equal or similar climbing hold colors. Im looking for an algorithm for allocating climbing hold colors to wall sectors. Until now we did that manually, with varying and sometimes unpleasant results. Here are our rulesp  pIf a route in sector A is red, no red route may be set in the sectors nearby A1 and A1. Preferably, no route with that color should be set in the sectors A2 and A2 unless special care is taken by the route setters to make the routes not touch.p  pDifferent colors in one or adjacent sectors should be sufficiently different. For example, combinations like red and pink are not allowed, red and violet should be avoided. Colors being complementary to each other is not really a reason to combine them in an area, because we have climbers who are redgreen color blind some other flavors as well. Also, there are noncolors such as white and black also dont go together, fluorescent colors and holds with two or three colors combined. However, we can safely say which color combinations go well together, which should be avoided and which are not allowed.p  pThere can be up to four routes in a sector. Sectors with just one or two routes should be avoided. We have different amounts of each color, so that must be taken into account as well. Sectors may be circular such as around a pillar or otherwise interconnected a pillar and a nearby wall which are connected by a roof.p  pIs there a common approach to such a problemp  hr  pEdit 1br I have implemented mbeckishs suggestion and wrote a simulated annealing algorithm for this problem. While I believe that my code works as it should, the results are not satisfactory.p  pHere are some detailsp  ul liThere are 15 sectors with 4 routes eachli liThere are 10 route colors 3 primary, 3 secondary, black, white, turquoise and violetwhite combinedli liThe amount of each color is fixed between 3 and 8 routes per colorli liThe colors are clustered when the algorithm startsli liI defined a matrix with a penalty 1e2...1 for each possible color combinationli lithe energy function sums up all penalties within each sector and between adjacent sectorsli lithe neighbour function swaps a randomly chosen pair of routes between two different sectors unless the route colors are equal, in that case a new pair for swapping is chosenli liT decays exponentiallyli liP is implemented as in the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSimulatedannealing relnofollowwikipedia article on simulated annealinga.li ul  pThis will happily run and swap around, but the results always contain sectors with two routes of equal color. Nevertheless Id like to include a convergence plot of energy normalized blue current, green best vs iterationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAEoKU.png altenter image description herep  pResults are similar when I shuffle the routes before starting the algorithm. Its like doing some preiterations without looking at penalties. Here is the same kind of plot, preshuffled, with a  faster decay of T to make the algorithm more greedy, and more iterationsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRndWf.png altenter image description herep  hr  pEdit 2 The neighbour function now picks a random color C1 from the sector with the highest energy S1 and swaps it with a random color C2 from a random other sector S2, unless C1 is already contained in S2 or C2 is already contained in S1. This gives slightly better results, but they still contain sectors with duplicate colors. Ill try to come up with something different now.p

Negative 281 pSo basically, I have a tab bar where you have an add button to clone tabs and later edit them. My problem is that once so many tabs are added, my left and right arrows and my add button are removed. How can I add tabs, but keep my buttons from disappearing Fixed position is not an option, I want the buttons next to the newest tab, and once the bar reaches a maxwidth, the buttons stay there. the arrows are to scroll through the tabs to see ones that will be hidden on overflow. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpHraC1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpHraC1ap  pstronghtmlstrongp  precodeltdiv classtabBox stylemaxwidth800pxgt   ltul classtabsgt     ltli classselectedgtlta hrefgtCertificate of Quantityltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtCOQ  ProductsChemicalsltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtMovement Summaryltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtBarge Surveyltagtltligt      ltul classtabButtonsgt       ltligtlta href classtabNavLeftgtltltagtltligt       ltligtlta hrefstep2b.html classtabNavRightgtgtltagtltligt       ltligtltdiv classtabNavAdd titleAdd another report form to nomination stylemargintop6pxgt       ltinput typebutton valueadd classaddTab gtltdivgtltligt     ltulgt                 ltulgt   ltdivgt codepre  pstrongjquerystrongp  precode add new tab input.addTab.liveclick, function event    var ultab  this.closest.tabs  cache ul.tabs   var li  ultab.childrenlinot.selected.first  cache the row     ultab.childrenlilast.afterli.clone.finda.attrhref, .textNew Tab.end  codepre

Im doing the easy thing and just not allowing itp  pWhat ever I put in there.. it ends up leaving whitespace and doing other weird stuff.  p  pstrongeditstrong  so... ive tried a few ways but never found a perfect solution to thisp

Negative 281 pI am having trouble creating a correct HABTM hasandbelongstomany relation where custom SQL behaviour is required.  The idea is to have Documents which can be attached to a single Service or multiple Services, as well as those same Services having a single or many Documents attached to it.

Negative 281 blockquote   pSo, Im working on a social political website. Currently Im working on the map page that contains all 100 North Carolina Counties and when you hover each county, its corresponding election results  data displays. For the first loop, Im pulling out the election result numbers and percentages to each party  Republican, Democratic, Other . To display the corresponding candidate to each election results, Ive had to create a nested loop. Ive decided to throw the nested loop into a function so its not sitting in with the rest of the code on the template. This is what it looks like in my functions.php filep blockquote  precodefunction grabcandidatenamecounty, office, party   args  arrayarraykey gt county, value gt county,arraykey gt office, value gt office,arraykey gt party, value gt party  cquery  new WPQueryarray     posttype gt governmentofficials,     showposts gt 1,     metaquery gt array         relation gt AND,         args       ifcquerygthaveposts       while cquerygthaveposts  cquerygtthepost          echo thetitle     endwhile wpresetpostdata endif  codepre  blockquote   pAlright, now  this is what it looks like in my template file for this bitp blockquote  precodeThis pulls information from the election results that each candidate custom post type can relate to. category  getthecategory officer  getfieldoffice codepre  blockquote   pThis is the function being called out.

So, my thought would be that my meta keys amp values are being ignored. I understand that right now I have them stuffed in my args variable, but that was just to tidy things up. If I list the arrays with the metaquery then my candidate names dont even show up on my election results page.p      pThanks in advancep blockquote  pAlright, Ive fixed it.p  pAlright, so the code above works. I was just an idiot and forgot to enter in meta data options in for county and office.

Negative 281 pI want to make an APInode.js with a get function. The module I use supports a write, and all incoming data is emitted by an event which I can subscribe too. The underlying system is based on polling.p  pBut I also want to add pollers that write using setInterval. When I add an listener for requesting the rpm, I get the RPM information every second. When I call a get at the same time for vss, its possible that the data.name and type dont match.

So the user always stays on the same page the index page, but the content changes.p  pHowever, I am trying to make the website available in different languages, and I am wondering about how to do that. I thought about having an codeengcode folder in my codeviewscode folder, with only HTML content in english. I would then check if the language is set to english in order to know which content to include in the page using jQuery.p  pBut I dont know how exactly I would do that, how good that method is, or which method to use for that matter. Also, is using Javascript to change a div content the way I do a good practice  What would you recommend p

Id 3 is ok too, because I would exclude him out later on, but for id 1 it says the second unpayment was in May, while I want to make it to be the first because he unpaid in March, but paid again in April so it should start ranking from there. Once he paid his last payment the process starts again.p  pThe idea is to keep it simple without complex queries.

Negative 281 pIm relatively new to PHP and slowly learning the idiosyncrasies specific to the language. One thing I get dinged by a lot is that I so Im told use too many function calls and am generally asked to do things to work around them. Heres two examplesp  precode Change this  catch Exception e    print It seems that error  . egtgetCode .  occured   logError  . egtgetCode    To this  catch Exception e    code  egtgetCode   print It seems that error  . code .  occured   logError  . code  codepre  p2nd Examplep  precode Change this customergtsetProductsproducts   To this if emptyproducts    customergtsetProductsproducts  codepre  pIn the first example I find that assigning codeegtgetCodecode to codecodecode ads a slight cognitive overhead Whats code Ah, its the code from the exception. Whereas the second example adds cyclomatic complexity. In both examples I find the optimization to come at the cost of readability and maintainability.p  pstrongIs the performance increase worth it or is this micro optimizationstrongp  pI should note that were stuck with PHP 5.2 for right now.p  pIve done some very rough bench tests and find the function call performance hit to be on the order of 10 to 70 depending on the nature of my bench test. Ill concede that this is significant. But before that catch block is hit there was a call to a database and an HTTP end point. Before codeproductscode was set on the codecustomercode there was a complex sort that happened to the codeproductscode array. strongAt the end of the day does this optimization justify the cost of making the code harder to read and maintainstrong Or, although these examples are simplifications, does anybody find the 2nd examples just as easy or easier to read than the first am I being a wienerp  pCan anyone cite any good articles or studies about thisp  h2Edith2  pAn example bench testp  precodeltphp class Foo          private list         public function setListlist                  thisgtlist  list            foo1  new Foo  fori  0 i lt 1000000 i          a  array         if emptya                 foo1gtsetLista  gt codepre  pRun that file with the codetimecode command.

Negative 281 pI have an app, so far basic on technical grounds, that seems to take a long time to load. At present it displays a background image and shows 12 images on top of it, not much more sophisticated than a Hello, World app.p  pThe status in Xcode is Waiting for  s iPhone to launch, and it stays there for several minutes before finally waiting for it to launch. This is with the device tethered to the computer. Xcode says, No issues to the right of that.p  pThe only thing I can think of that may need slimming down is several highresolution images. Im not doing anything particularly interesting besides displaying a shrunken version of one of them, and in the past I had what seemed like normal response times.p  pAre there any obvious causes for why a starter app should take several minutes to get up and running on an iPhonep  pThanks,p

Negative 281 pFor a lot of jQuery functions you are able to pass an options object to the function. Internally that is overriding the default options for the function.

Negative 281 pI programming a 60 FPS game and need to find those code sections that are badly affecting the game loops performance. Im currently storing a nanosecond timestamp at the start of the frame and split my code into logic parts, for example Rendering particles or Iterate through enemy AIs. After finishing the execution of each section I store the execution time needed to execute code since the last section finished. At the end I retrieve the total execution time [nanoseconds now] minus [first nanosecond timestamp] and calculating the percentage of each code section execution time. This allows me to display the percentage taken by each section, but doesnt seem to be the perfect solution. I guess GC randomly affects code section executions.p  pIs there a better way I can implement or even an API  Analytics Tool for doing exactly thisp

Every second, a new MB is allocated in the memory. The problem I encounter is if I uncomment the calloc line and comment the malloc and memset lines. From what I know, calloc should initialize all bytes to zero in the allocated memory the same thing that malloc and memset do.p  pWhen I run the code with calloc without the malloc and memset, an initial 1 MB is allocated as it is normal, and then after some seconds 10 another MB is allocated.p  pWhy is this behaviourp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 281 pI want to have a custom directive that is reusable and creates an isolate scope so it can be used anywhere as long as the consumer uses the API defined by the directive.  Then, I want the consumer to easily be able to mix and match different reusable pieces that fit within the main reusable directive.p  pThe situation Im working with is a drop down menu.  The main directive would isolate the scope and define the API for the dropdown as a whole.  The inner directives would allow the consumer to choose whether they want a button that opens the menu, a search boxinput field that opens the menu, etc.  Then they could also choose what menu style is usedp  precodeltdropdown items... selecteditem...gt   ltdropdownbuttongtTranscluded button text hereltdropdownbuttongt   ltdropdowniconlistgtltdropdowniconlistgt ltdropdowngt codepre  pThe parent directivecontroller would handle statecommunication for the inner pieces ie. the button might trigger the open state, and the list would respond by opening. In other words, the parent directive would provide a single place for the consumer to define behavior and isolate scope from the rest of the page, while the nested directives would change shared staterespond to changes in shared state based on their role.p  pI actually had this working by using an isolate scope on the main dropdown directive and then inheriting scope with the nested directives didnt specify scope ... on the nested directives.  But, with Angular 1.2, things have changed such that the isolate scope of the parent is truly isolatedthe children inherit the scope that exists outside the parent directive, rather than sharing its isolated scope.p  pWhat is the Angular way to accomplish such a thingp  pIve started retrofitting my existing code to share the controller from the parent directive with the nested children, but I feel thats the wrong way to go once I get into the situation where the children need to listen for changes on the shared scope... The only way I can see to do that would be to pass a callback function from the nested directives into the shared controller which it would bind to a scope.on method.  Seems like the wrong path to head down.p

Negative 281 pI want to set permissions to a user group in Django. I noticed that Django provides the inbuilt functionality of setting the permissions to a user group. Basically, what I need is to provide some features to a user group and then inherit those features to its users.p  pIve some permissions in the codeauthpermissionscode table, I want to use that permissions and apply it to the users group and thereby to the user.

As of right now, I was just making codeuserscode, not the user groups. So, my question is How do I make a user group and apply permissions onto it. Also, add users to a user group. The properties of the user group should be inherited to its usersp

Negative 281 pI am working on a project which allows tagging of directories. As part of the interface, I would like to display a list of the directories. Each entry in the list would be the directory name, plus a number of columns. One for each tag known to the application at the time, with a checkbox indicating whether the directory has been tagged with that tag or not. The user can then tag or untag a number of directories easily.p  pI thought using a WPF DataGrid would be good for this, but am having trouble deciding how to store the tagged directory in a way that allows me to bind it to the DataGrid instance easily, since the number amp makeup of the tags could change at any time.p  ul lipOne way would be to have a master list of directories amp their tags, and from this I could generate a complementary set of Expando objects every time the number of known tags changed. Each object would have a boolean property for each tag. The list of these objects could be bound to the DataGrid and autogenerated columns would display them automatically. The nice thing about this is that it does model what I am displaying nicely  even if the directory doesnt have a tag, it still has the property of doesnt have this tag, and its simple to implement. The problems are its messy and inefficient, and not sure about this I dont think I can call methods on the Expando object when the properties change.pli lipThe other way would be to dynamically recreate a DataTemplate whenever the known tags changed. The downside is I have to dynamically create a DataTemplate in codebehind.pli ul  pI wonder though thinking about the first option  is there a way to override the properties an object appears to have to WPFp  pFor example, is there an interface like codeIDataBindingSourcecode which looks something likep  precodeinterface IDataBindingSource      string[] MyProperties     Type[] MyPropertyTypes     object[] MyPropertyValues  codepre  pThat is, strongis there a simple way to change what properties appear to the DataGrid and so use autogenerated columns at runtimestrongp  pEDIT To clarify about the tags. By tags I mean the small descriptive string version. The number of tags the user will want is limited, but there are a large number of directories. So I would like to display a set of checkboxes for each directory that would allow me to add or remove a tag for that directory, just like you would set permissions for users, for example each permission being a tag, users the directory. The number of potential tags at any given time though is variable, as the user could add more, or remove a tag from all directories and effectively deleting it.p  pThis isnt a hard problem  a really naive way would simply be to manually draw a table, one column for the directory, the others with the known list of tags, and then logic would create and set checkboxes in the cells with loops. There are many ways to do it  but I would like to use the nicest  that allows me to code it quickly and preserves functionality inbuilt into controls like freezing and reordering, etc.p

For examplep  pI had the following url mapping stronghomestrong set to strongISAUTHENTICATEDFULLYstrong to allow everybody to go to home. I have deleted that database entry and if I run the app locally pointing against prod db and when trying to go to home I get an access denied which is good, exactly what I wanted. Additionally, if I go to strongsecurityInfomappingsstrong that url is not  displayed because it no longer exists in the database.p  pBut if I go to the prodcution application which is pointing to the same database and go to stronghomestrong I am still alowed to access it  even though that rule is no longer on the db. Also if I look at strongsecurityInfomappingsstrong that url mapping stronghomestrong its still displaying but yet if I go to requestmapsearch and look for it, its not found.p  pTo me it seems like the permissions work not based on Requestmap but based on what securityConfigmappings states. p  h1QUESTIONh1  pMy question is how come the data in securityInfomappings does not match whats on the Requestmap tablep  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 281 pI am writing a small PHPMySQL application for personal use. This is my first time using PHP, so bear with me.p  pI wanted to be able to change the DB schema afterwards, if needed, so everything went into variables stuff like table and column names.

This was a dealbreaker. Approach number two does away with the codeglobalcodes, but the syntax is not so nice.p  pIs there a timetried PHPstyle solution to this problemp

Negative 281 pIve created a Kendo Scheduler that binds to a remote data source. The remote datasource is actually a combination of two separate data sources. This part is working okay.p  pQuestion is... is there any way to prevent certain events from being destroyedp  pIve stopped other forms of editing by checking a certain field in the events properties and calling codee.preventDefaultcode on the codeeditcode, codemoveStartcode and coderesizeStartcode events if it should be readonly. This works fine, but I cant prevent deletes.p  pAny suggestions greatly appreciated.p

Negative 281 pi was going through web service concept.In general the internet is working based on HTTP as application protocol and TCP as transport protocol.Then where does SOAP fit here. web service is an inter operable mechanism done by using XML format. If WSDL describes webservice data in terms of XML do we need an XML based SOAP protocol. What we can do is just send the WSDL languaugei guess it is created by visual studio based on our web service over HTTP, can some body brief about this.p  pone more question Restful service doesnot contain WSDLp

Negative 281 pIm developing an strongMVC 5strong web application with an existing database. The application really has strongtwo types of interfacesstrong, one set for strongregistered usersstrong only, the other set for strongadmin usersstrong only. p  pUnfortunately both types of users are not stored in the same User table, rather, in two separate tables, i.e., tblUser and tblAdmin. This is an inherited database so theres nothing I can do about that.p  pI was thinking of creating strongtwo MVC websitesstrong, one for the registered users, and the other for the admin users. I could still do this, however, it would mean repetition of some code.p  pAnother option I was thinking of doing was just having one MVC site, and create an strongAreastrong within that to securely place all the administration interfaces and code.p  pI would then have strongtwo Account Controllersstrong standard Account Controller and one in the Area for Admins each with their own strongLogin Actionstrong. p  pEach Login Action would use the latest strongASP.Net Identitystrong for Authentication i.e. setup ClaimsIdentity, IAuthenticationManager etc, something like thisp  precodeprivate IAuthenticationManager AuthenticationManager      get              return HttpContext.GetOwinContext.Authentication        public ActionResult LoginLoginViewModel model, string returnUrl              if ModelState.IsValid                      var user  AccountService.VerifyUserLoginmodel.UserName, model.Password             if user  null                              var identity  new ClaimsIdentitynew[]  new ClaimClaimTypes.Name, model.UserName, , DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie, ClaimTypes.Name, ClaimTypes.Role                  Add claim to store doctor ID, roles can also be added here if needed                 identity.AddClaimnew ClaimClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, Convert.ToStringuser.userID                 identity.AddClaimnew ClaimClaimTypes.Role, AddRoleHere                  AuthenticationManager.SignInnew AuthenticationProperties  IsPersistent  model.RememberMe , identity                  return RedirectToLocalreturnUrl                          else                              ModelState.AddModelError, Invalid username or password.                                 If we got this far, something failed, redisplay form         return Viewmodel      codepre  pMy worry is that, if I use the strongAuthenticationManager.SignInstrong in both Login Actions, albeit they are different Actions, would this cause problems, e.g., sharing of the authentication cookie being setup, threading issues or even race conditions.p  pI feel I need to ask this question and hopefully get some response before I continue with this application. p  pIve seen a previous application with these issues, not necessarily to do with authentication, but lets just say it makes me very cautious especially when data is involved.p  pAny feedback or discussion around this would be great.p  pThanks.p

Negative 281 pI have data that is best represented by a tree. Serializing the structure makes the most sense, because I dont want to sort it every time, and it would allow me to make persistent modifications to the data.p  pOn the other hand, this tree is going to be accessed from different processes on different machines, so Im worried about the details of reading and writing. Basic searches didnt yield very much on the topic. p  ol liIf two users simultaneously attempt to revive the tree and read from it, can they both be served at once, or does one arbitrarily happen firstli liIf two users have the tree open assuming they can and one makes an edit, does the other see the change implemented I assume they dont because they each received what amounts to a copy of the original data.li liIf two users alter the object and close it at the same time, again, does one come first, or is an attempt made to make both changes simultaneouslyli ol  pI was thinking of making a queue of changes to be applied to the tree, and then having the tree execute them in the order of submission. I thought I would ask what my problems are before trying to solve any of them.p

Negative 281 pIve built an image slider that shows 2 partial images and 1 full image on codemouseentercode of that particular image. It worked fine until I set the last image to its full width using css as a default image this way when the user opens the page this 1 image will show completely. p  pI have used an codeifcode statement so the default image is reduced in width when the other images are hovered over. However as soon as any of the images are moused over including the default the last image momentarily reduces its width before the other image expands. This creates a temporary gap on the right side of the slider. Ive tried changing the animation times and using other methods like jQuerys codecsscode method without any success. p  pThe same problem also occurs on codemouseleavecode when it leaves the containing slider from the last default image only.p  pAnyone have any idea on how to overcome this bug so the animation runs smoothly  p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idimgSlidergt     ltulgt         ltligtltimg srcimagesGirlskyscraper.jpg height300 width300 gtltligt         ltligtltimg srcimagescitiesskies.jpg height300 width300gtltligt         ltligtltimg srcimageswindows.jpg height300 width300 gtltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodedivimgSlider      height300px     width600px     border1px solid 2367d3   divimgSlider ul li      floatleft     width150px     overflow hidden   divimgSlider ul lilastchild      width300px  codepre  pstrongJavaScriptstrongp  precodedivimgSlider ul li.on     mouseenter function         ifthis  divimgSlider ul lilast              divimgSlider ul lilast.animate                 width 150             ,0                   this.animatewidth300,400     ,     mouseleave function         this.animatewidth150,400        divimgSlider.onmouseleave,function     divimgSlider ul lilast.animate         width300     ,400  codepre  pjsfiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXwL2G relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netXwL2Gap

Negative 281 pLately Ive started learning about codereactivecode, codeeventdrivencode, nonblocking Java frameworks and there is one that caught my eye  codevert.xcode. p  pI guess the same question may apply to strongakka Play frameworkstrong cause their philosophy or one of the goals is the same  and that is emreducing thread number and therefore highering scalability of an applicationem. p  pcodevert.xcode suggests that number of threads it consumes is equivalent to the number of CPU cores but it also bares in mind that sometimes you have to do a blocking operation so it encourages a developer to perform a blocking operation on a seperate working thread worker vertical in terms of vert.x. p  pAnd thats where we come to my questionp  ul liif Im supposed to perform blocking IO operations on a new separate thread that means that every user that does a blocking operation has a new thread and therefore number of threads again becomes equal to the number of users as in a classical blocking thread modelli ul  pA real example would be a JDBC query  if 1000 concurrent users query  a SQL database via JDBC every user spawns its own worker thread for that blocking operation. From my point of view theres no thread sparing, improved scalability or RAM sparing compared to classical blocking thread model. I must be missing something... Or not Thanks in advance for all the answers.p

Negative 281 pI just starter learning the new features in C 11. I was reading about lambdas in C Primer Stanley Lippman and was experimenting with them.p  pI tried the following pieces of codep  precodeauto func gt int       int c0     return []gt int return 0   int main     auto p  func  codepre  pThis code compiled fine. So I guess lambdas without any captures are just generated as normal functions by the compiler and we can use a normal function pointer to them.p  pNow I changed the code to use capturesp  precodeauto func gt int       int c0     return []gt int return c   int main     auto p  func  codepre  pBut this failed to compile. I got the following compilation error while using gp  precodemain.cpp In function int  func main.cpp631 error cannot convert funclambda0 to int  in return return []gt int return c codepre  pFrom the error I can understand that it is not a normal function that is generated and it might probably be a class with an overloaded calloperator. Or is it something elsep  pMy questions  How does the compiler handle lambdas internally How should I pass around lambdas that use captures i.e. what should be the return value from func I cant currently think of a use case where I would need to use lambdas like this but I just want to understand more about them. Please help.p  pThanks.p
Negative 281 pI have trouble with the Java Sockets.  p  pI need to connect a server and a client through the local network and as there can be more then two devices connected to the router the Client must find out the Address of the server. p  pThe only way I know to solve this problem is to get the three first numbers of the clients IPv4address and loop every of the 254 other possible IPs. emI know that this way is very slow and may cause many problems.

So, whats the problem, I hear you ask Well, since I want to refresh the quotes every time the application starts up and get fresh ones from the server, the way Im trying to accomplish that is by deleting the contents of the Inanity table of the database and repopulate them on startup. So, I have created this method in the SQLi database helper class thats called strongdbDeletestrong which I call right at the start of the strongdonestrong method of the FindCallback class of the Parse.com library although I have commented this out from this code, it works swimmingly it deletes the contents of the database just fine. Unfortunately, when I do that, it appears that the local SQLite database is not repopulated on app startup for some infernal reason, so I keep getting the placeholder a, b and 1 values that are returned when the strongretrieveInanitystrong method cannot find cursor contents. Here is the strongdbDeletestrong method, which is quite simplep  precodepublic void dbDelete          SQLiteDatabase db  this.getWritableDatabase         db.deleteTABLEINANITIES, null, null      codepre  pI have been trying to solve this for quite some time and its driving me crazy. I understand that the question is pretty convoluted, big and that it doesnt contain any catchy NullPointerExceptionslogcat action but any help would be appreciated. I must be missing something obvious related to the SQLite database use but I simply cant figure it out. p

The date can either be provided in the URL or as a user selection on a form, doesnt matter to be very much.p  pAny ideas Ive been pulling my hair out with this for a while nowp  pThanks in advance for any ideasp  pEdit I worked this out in a getcontextdata method for the viewp  precodeusers  User.objects.annotatetransactionsCounttransaction.excludetransactions0.orderbyname for u in users         totals  Transaction.objects.filteruseru,year2012.valuestype.annotatetotalSumtotal codepre  pWith this totals becomes a dicts of the totals for each of the different values of type  so thats perfect. But, Im not sure how to get both of those to a template  users being a QuerySet and an array of totals since there would be one for every item in users including some thatd have no values.p

Negative 281 pContextp  ul lipI am attempting to combine a large amount of separate password list text files into a single file for use in dictionary based password cracking.pli lipEach text file is line delimited a single password per line and there are 82 separate files at the moment. Most 66 files are in the 1100Mb filesize range, 12 are 100700Mb, 3 are 2Gb, and 1 the most problematic is 11.2Gb.pli lipIn total I estimate 1.75 billion nonunique passwords need processing of these I estimate 450 million 25 will be duplicates and ultimately need to be discarded.pli lipI am attempting to do this on a device which has a little over 6Gb of RAM free to play with i.e. 8Gb with 2Gb already consumed.pli ul  pProblemp  pI need a way to a aggregate all of these passwords together and b remove exact duplicates, within my RAM memory constrains and within a reasonable 7 days, ideally much less but really I dont care if it takes weeks and then I never need to run it again time window.p  pI am a competent Python programmer and thus gave it a crack several times already. My most successful attempt used sqlite3 to store processed passwords on the hard disk as it progressed. However this meant that keeping track of which files had already been completed between processing instances I cancelled and restarted several times to make changes was tediously achieved by hashing each completed file and maintainingcomparing these each time a new file was opened. For the very large files however, any progress would be lost.p  pI was processing the text files in blocks of 1 billion at most lines at a time to prevent memory exhaustion without having no feedback for extended periods of time. I know that I could, given a lot of time populate my database fully as I achieved a DB filesize of 4.5Gb in 24 hours of runtime so I estimate that left to run it would take about 4 days at most to get through everything, but I dont know ifhow to most efficiently readwrite to it nor do I have any good ideas on how to tackle the removing of duplicates do it as I am populating the DB or make additional passes afterwards... Is there a much faster means of doing lookups for uniqueness in a database configuration I dont know about.p  hr  pMy request here today is for advice  solutions to a programming and optimisation approach on how to achieve my giant, unique password list ideally with Python. I am totally open to taking a completely different tack if I am off the mark already.p  hr  pTwo nice to haves arep  ul lipA way to add more passwords in the future without having to rebuild the whole list andpli lipA database lt 20Gb at the end of all this so that it isnt a huge pain to move around.pli ul  hr  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pBased on CLs solution which was ultimately a lot more elegant than what I was thinking I came up with a slightly modified method.p  pFollowing CLs advice I setup a sqlite3 DB and fed the text files into a Python script which consumed them and then output a command to insert them into the DB. Straight off the bat this did work but was extremely infeasibly slow.p  pI solved this by a few simple DB optimisations which was much easier to implement and frankly cleaner to just do all from the core Python script included below which builds upon CLs skeleton code. The fact that the original code was generating strongsooooooostrong many IO operations was causing something funny on my Win7 OS causing BSODs and lost data. I solved this by making the insertion of a whole password file one SQL transaction plus a couple of pragma changes. In the end the code runs at about 30,000 insertions  sec which is not the best but is certainly acceptable for my purposes.p  pIt may be the case that this will still fail on the largest of files but ifwhen that is the case, I will simply chunk the file down into smaller 1Gb portions and consume them individually.p  precodeimport sys import apsw  i  0 con  apsw.Connectionpasswordstest.db cur  con.cursor  cur.executeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Passwordspassword TEXT PRIMARY KEY WITHOUT ROWID cur.executePRAGMA journalmode  MEMORY cur.executePRAGMA synchronous  OFF  cur.executeBEGIN TRANSACTION for line in sys.stdin     escaped  line.rstrip.replace,      cur.executeINSERT OR IGNORE INTO Passwords VALUES, escaped,     i  1     if i  100000  0  Simple line counter to show how far through a file we are         print i  cur.executeCOMMIT con.closeTrue codepre  pThis code is then run from command linep  precodeinsertpasswords.py lt passwordfile1.txt codepre  pAnd automated byp  precodefor f in .txt do  insertpasswords.py lt f  codepre  pAll in all, the DB file itself is not growing too quickly, the insertion rate is sufficient, I can breakresume operations at the drop of a hat, duplicate values are being accurately discarded, and the current limiting factor is the lookup speed of the DB not the CPU or disk space.p

Negative 281 pI am writing a Web Service client using JAXWS with Metro 2.3  RI. My application is Multi Threaded and supposed to endure an heavy load there for I keep the Service Thread Safe as a static member and use an Object Pool for the Port objects. The problem is that whenever I attempt to invoke the externalized web service method, a new connection is being created instead of reuse the active one. Note that the connection stays established for 10 seconds. I made sure to use the following VM arguments Djava.endorsed.dirsendorsed Dhttp.keepAlivetrue Dhttp.maxConnections20 and verified that the keep alive header is being set as part of the HTTP Request. I am putting in the endorsed folder all the Metro 2.3 jars webservicesapi.jar, webservicesextra.jar, webservicesextraapi.jar, webservicesrt.jar, webservicestools.jar and doing that in order to insure that I operate with the 2.3 version and not with what comes in the JDK. I am using JDK1.7.051 and JRE1.7p  pWhat else should I be doing in order to be able to work with HTTP connection pool over Metro JAXWS 2.3p  pThanks Urip

However in X.9 Mavericks, the script only works correctly if run directly in bash deleting both the users directory and removes the user from the user list, but when run from a LogoutHook, the entire Users directory gets deleted but the users themselves do not. If the machine is restarted and you select a user from the login screen, the machine goes through the Apple initial setup and generates a new Users directory and a new directory for the user in question. From the little bit of looking around I have done LoginLogout hooks have issues working with Mavericks, but none of the other solutions I have seen seem to pertain to this issue. This will be used for a computer lab setting and we cannot downgrade to X.8, any suggestionsp

Negative 281 pIm working with a .net DLL Ive created previously as an interface between a serial device programmable MCU and MATLAB Example operation 1. MATLAB sends a open port request via the DLL to the serial port,  2. The port is opened in the DLL and MATLAB have no control over the port only the DLL has, 3. MATLAB sends additional requests like read, write etc... to the DLL and it responds accordingly  4. MATLAB sends a close port request via the DLL to the serial port,  5. The port is closed BUT still occupied by the DLL.p  pThe problem is that since the DLL is inside MATLAB and it cannot be unloaded MATLAB, as stated in the MATHWORKS website, doesnt support unloading an already loaded .net DLL and MATLAB cannot control the port directly, the port is unavailable until MATLAB is closed and the DLL is unloaded happens only when MATLAB closes. This means that the user needs to close MATLAB a couple of times...p  pSo, is their any workaround way to unload the DLL or any another solutionp  pP.S, MATLAB has some serial capabilities but they are very limited in performance data acquisition for example hence they cannot be used also, the DAQToolbox is good but costs alot.p

Is there something more to itp  pAs I understand it, all the javascript is joined together, all the HTML, all the CSS, all the templates.p  pIs there any sense of the kind of protection that one would get with Python modules, with OOP classes  I know that whether one declares a variable in a Meteor JS file with a var or not determines whether it has global access how does one use this to modularize the app, if all the Javascript files are joined together if they emareem in fact joined togetherp  pForgive my ultanewbie question but if you have any insight on how to see the forest for the trees, much appreciated.p

Negative 281 pI have a pretty runofthemill node.js server with expressjs installed locally for development purposes I store various files and request them via a basic HTTP call that returns the file through express res.download feature. Most of the time, this works without a hitch.

Out of maybe a hundred files, this has only happened twice, and both were JPG files, but the sample is too small to draw any conclusion. What I know  p  ul liThe issue is reproductible  if it happens with a file, it always happensli liThe issue is not related to the way files are stored  if I swap the problematic file with another one but keep everything else the same name, location, etc., it works fineli liRight before the res.download happens, the file is okay  checking its size with fs.stats returns the correct valueli liThe HTTP response encounters no visible problem  no error, 200 response code...li liThe source file seems to have normal metadata and JPG markersli ul  pstrongUPDATEstrong I did some tests, and strongthe issue seems to be somehow related to encodingstrong  the mangled response file is, for reasons unknown, encoded in UTF8  the size discrepancy comes from all nonUTF8 characters being replaced by codeEF BF BDcode the unknown character symbol  I still cant understand why it happens, what makes these few files different from others, and if it can be detected andor corrected upstream. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong After some additional tests, I still cant quite pinpoint the cause, but I can add the following info  p  ul lipSystemswise, the issue happens during the data streaming in fs.jspli lipThe root cause is located somewhere in the EXIF data of the imagepli ul  pFor those interested, the source image source.JPG and download result response.JPG can be found here  a hrefhttpwww.sycomor.frtest relnofollowhttpwww.sycomor.frtesta  I also added a similar image that isnt affected by the download and comes out clean.

Negative 281 pI have a trading card game Like top trumps Where theres a deck of cards on the left and one on the right, I want to pass objects between these lists of cards, which I CAN do. But not without using a switch case to select the new cards as in the code below, I need to pass the card objects and remove them so eventually one list will have all 30 cards and one will have none, how do I do this when all my cards on the left are simply called nextCard Can I use some sort of array Please use some sort os code or pseudocode in your answers, as Im just a beginner.   p  pTLDR Need to move card objects between lists, Adding them to one list, deleting from another. Right now Im using a switch statement to pass in object data to list. Ill answer any questions you ask.p  precodeListltCardsgt myListofCards ListltCardsgt myListofCards2  First card will be displayed on the left on the screen myListofCards  new ListltCardsgt nextCard  new Cards nextCard.cardName  Character nextCard.strength  45 myListofCards.AddnextCard listOfCards.ItemsSource  myListofCards  Second card will be displayed on the right on the screen myListofCards2  new ListltCardsgt nextCard2  new Cards nextCard2.strength2  Character2 nextCard2.age2  42 myListofCards2.AddnextCard listOfCards2.ItemsSource  myListofCards2  When the value of the card on the left of the screen is compared  to the one on the right, it is higher, so the card on the right should move to the deck on the left side. Just to test this out I used the following switch case statement. It works but, when I eventually have about 30 cards and they are being added and removed from the 2 different decks, the case statements obviously will not  work anymore, so what I want is to be able to move the different cards between lists without the switch case.    int index  rand.Nextrandom.Count var i random[index] random.RemoveAtindex  switch i      case 1     myListofCards  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard  new Cards     nextCard.cardName  Character     nextCard.strength  45     myListofCards.AddnextCard     listOfCards.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break      case 2     myListofCards  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard  new Cards     nextCard.cardName  Char     nextCard.strength  55     myListofCards.AddnextCard     listOfCards.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break   int index  rand.Nextrandom.Count var j random[index] random.RemoveAtindex  switch j      case 1     myListofCards2  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard2  new Cards     nextCard2.cardName  Character2     nextCard2.strength  45     myListofCards2.AddnextCard         listOfCards2.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break      case 2     myListofCards2  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard2  new Cards     nextCard2.cardName  Char2     nextCard2.strength  60     myListofCards2.AddnextCard     listOfCards2.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break   public void cardSwapandScore              winback.Visibility  Visibility.Visible         win.Visibility  Visibility.Visible         if nextCard.power gt nextCardComp.powerComp                      win.Text  You win                           myListofCards.AddnextCardComp             myListofCards2.RemovenextCardComp                               else         win.Text  You Lose         win.Visibility  Visibility.Visible                  myListofCards2.AddnextCard         myListofCards.RemovenextCard        codepre

If I enter Y, then the dowhile loop succesfully repeats, but the getline function seems to already think that there is input in cin, even though I dont enter anything.p  pHere is my code so farp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt includeltstringgt  using namespace std  int main           string secretWord     string secretWordClean       string guessedLetters to be loaded with  characters equal to length of secretWord     string incorrectlyGuessedChars       char individualCharGuess     char playAgain     sizet countOfLetters  0 begine count at 0     sizet guessesRemaining     int guessedUsed       begingamelabel which we can use to bring us back to the start of the dowhile loop at any time      dostart of the game      cout ltlt Please enter a secret word      getlinecin, secretWord y getline is cuaing the issue        forint i  0 i lt secretWord.length i             if isalphasecretWord[i]                      secretWordClean  secretWord[i]                             secretWord  secretWordClean assign all alpha secret word string back to original variable for better readability      guessesRemaining  secretWord.length  2       forint i  0 i lt secretWord.length i          guessedLetters   fills guessedLetters with blanks equal to the length of the secretWord                    cout ltlt Please guess a letter, you have  ltlt guessesRemaining ltlt  guesses remaining ltlt endl          cin gtgt individualCharGuess           forint i  0 i lt secretWord.length i every complete iteration of this for loop  one single guess                 ifsecretWord[i]  individualCharGuess                     guessedLetters[i]  individualCharGuess will replace the spaces with the correct character, if guessed                     countOfLetters if any letter is guessed correctly, this indicator will be inrimented above 0                     continue                                    ifsecretWord.findindividualCharGuess  stringnpos                     ifincorrectlyGuessedChars.findindividualCharGuess  stringnpos                     incorrectlyGuessedChars  individualCharGuess                                                           ifsecretWord.compareguessedLetters  0              cout ltlt You win The word was  ltlt secretWord ltlt endl              guessedUsed  secretWord.length  2  guessesRemaining  1               cout ltlt You used  ltlt guessedUsed ltlt  guesses. ltlt endl               cout ltlt Play again Enter Y for Yes, or anything else to exit               cin gtgt playAgain              ifplayAgain  Y              break exit the loop if user guesses all the letters and doesnt want to play again                            else                   goto begingame                                   guessesRemaining we decriment our total guesses remaining if the user does not win the game or run out of guesses           ifcountOfLetters gt 0              cout ltlt You have correctly guessed a letter ltlt endl              cout ltlt Here are the letters you have guessed correctly so far               cout ltlt guessedLetters ltlt endl              cout ltlt Here are the letters you have guessed incorrectly so far               cout ltlt incorrectlyGuessedChars ltlt endl              countOfLetters  0 reset the counter to prepare for next iteration of dowhile loop                    else if guessesRemaining lt 0               cout ltlt You have run out of guesses ltlt endl              cout ltlt Here are the letters that you guessed correctly               cout ltlt guessedLetters ltlt endl              cout ltlt Here are the letters you guessed incorrectly               cout ltlt incorrectlyGuessedChars ltlt endl              cout ltlt The secret word was  ltlt secretWord ltlt endl              cout ltlt Play again Enter Y for Yes, or anything else to exit               cin gtgt playAgain              ifplayAgain  Y              break exit the loop if user guesses all the letters and doesnt want to play again                            else goto begingame                    else               cout ltlt You guessed wrong Keep trying,  ltlt guessesRemaining ltlt  guesses to go ltlt endl              cout ltlt Here are the letters you have guessed correctly so far               cout ltlt guessedLetters ltlt endl              cout ltlt Here are the letters you have guessed incorrectly so far               cout ltlt incorrectlyGuessedChars ltlt endl                   while secretWord.compareguessedLetters  0  guessesRemaining  0 use to repeat the request for a single char guess       return 0  codepre

Negative 281 pIn Haskell syntax, we can have a abstract type like code[a gt b]code, which is a list of functions a to b.  A concrete type of this would be code[Int gt Int]code, such as codemap  [1..10]code. Is it possible to have a list of cascading functions in a type like code[a gt b, b gt c, c gt d, ...]code The individual elements of the list are all different I think so I dont think its possible. But is it possible with dependent types What would its type signature be preferably in pseudoHaskell syntaxp

Negative 281 pOn iTunesConnect, I submitted scaled app screenshots for the iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and the iPhone 4s. However, when I view the app on the App Store, I only see the 4s screenshots regardless of what device I am using I have physical access to all three devices. These screenshots are not simply inapp screenshots, they have been formatted to show the app running on the physical device itself so the difference is notable. I have experienced this problem on both of my app submissions, is there anyway this can be remediedp

Negative 281 pI have a big text file with 32000 rows and 60 columns. rows are genes and columns are samples and each cell contains the values of each gene in each sample. I want to remove those genesrows which have more than 10 times 2 and less than 2. which means for example if the first row has 2 or less than 2gene value in at least 10 samplescolumn I want to remove it. I think at first it should iterate over the rows to find those columns which have 2 or less than 2 and count them for each row. if the count is at least 10 the row will be removed. thanksp

Good for child themes to override or add to the sections.   Simply include this function in the child themes functions.php file.

The PKCS1 v1.5   representation appears as    CRYPT PAD ASN.1 OID, DIGEST data   Note that the padded ASN.1 will be of the following form    01  FF    00  prefix  hash where  is concatenation, 01, FF, and 00   are fixed octets of the corresponding hexadecimal value, hash is the   SHA1 digest of the data, and prefix is the ASN.1 BER SHA1 algorithm   designator prefix required in PKCS1 [RFC 2437], that is,    hex 30 21   30 09 06 05 2B 0E 03 02 1A 05 00 04 14 This prefix is included to make   it easier to use standard cryptographic libraries. The FF octet MUST   be repeated the maximum number of times such that the value of the   quantity being CRYPTed is one octet shorter than the RSA modulus.p blockquote  pIn other words, if I am have the stronghashstrong value for a certain XML element not encoded in base64, is that right, what do I do with it before sending it to the strongSignHashstrong in emRSACryptoServiceProviderem function I know its in the text, but I have troubles understanding it.

Negative 281 pIve been trying to switch my code from using one codeioservicecode per network connection to using shared ones, and Im seeing some very odd behaviour on server sockets client ones seem to work OK.p  pIn order to try to work out whats going on Ive restarted building up a simple example that will allow me to check my assumptions about everything that ought to happen. The first problem Ive hit is that codeioserviceruncode doesnt exit when there are no handlers left, and as far as I can tell the handlers arent removed from the work queue.p  pI have one thread that does an codeasyncacceptcode followed by an codeasyncreadcode. There is a separate client thread which has its own codeioservicecode. The client threads codeioservicecode is never run, and the servers one is run in yet another thread.p  pIm using a condition variable to wait in the server thread for the read to complete which will never happen as the client never writes. This times out just fine and then I call codesocket.cancelcode. I would expect this to remove the read handler and run to exit as the work queue is now empty.p  pI do see the read handler get called with a cancel error, but run never exits. When I tie the socket lifetime to the handler lifetime by lambda capturing a codesharedptrcode to the socket the memory isnt freed either.p  pThe server is set up like thisp  precodestdmutex mutex stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockmutex stdconditionvariable signal  boostasioioservice serverservice boostasioiptcpacceptor listenerserverservice stdmutex readmutex stduniquelockltstdmutexgt readlockreadmutex stdconditionvariable readdone stdthread server[amp]      stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockmutex     listener.openboostasioiptcpv4     listener.setoptionboostasiosocketbaseenableconnectionabortedtrue     listener.bindboostasioiptcpendpointboostasioiptcpv4, 4567     listener.listen      stdsharedptrltconnectiongt servercnxnew connectionserverservice     listener.asyncacceptservercnxgtsocket,         [amp, servercnx]const boostsystemerrorcodeamp error              logthread ltlt Server got a connection  ltlt error ltlt stdendl             boostasioasyncreaduntilservercnxgtsocket, servercnxgtbuffer, n,                 [amp, servercnx]const boostsystemerrorcodeamp error, stdsizet bytes                      logthread ltlt Got  ltlt bytes ltlt ,  ltlt error ltlt stdendl                     stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockreadmutex                     lock.unlock                     readdone.notifyone                               lock.unlock     signal.notifyone     if  readdone.waitforreadlock, stdchronoseconds1  stdcvstatustimeout           logthread ltlt Server read timed out  cancelling socket jobs ltlt stdendl         servercnxgtsocket.cancel         servercnxgtsocket.close      else          logthread ltlt Server data read ltlt stdendl          logthread ltlt Exiting server thread ltlt stdendl  signal.waitlock logthread ltlt Server set up ltlt stdendl codepre  pThe codeioservicecode thread is set up like thisp  precodestdthread serverio[amp]      logthread ltlt About to service server IO requests ltlt stdendl     try          serverservice.run      catch  ...           logthread ltlt Exception caught ltlt stdendl          logthread ltlt  Service jobs all run ltlt stdendl     signal.notifyone  codepre  pThe output is as followsp  precode10.0002 139992957945728 Server set up 10.0005 139992957945728 Client set up 10.0006 139992848398080 About to service server IO requests 10.0006 139992848398080 Server got a connection system0 11.0003 139992934819584 Server read timed out  cancelling socket jobs 11.0004 139992934819584 Exiting server thread 11.0004 139992848398080 Got 0, system125 20.0006 139992957945728 IO thread timed out servicing requests  stopping it  This should not happen because the server service should have run out of work 20.0006 139992957945728 Waiting for things to close.... 22.0008 139992957945728 Wait over, exiting codepre  pColumns are time  10s, thread ID, log messagep  pAt the 11 second mark you can see that the codeasyncreaduntilcode is called.

Negative 281 pI have a database on server X containing my source data. I also have a database on server Y that contains data I need to augment with data on server X.p  pCurrently we have a nightly job on server Y that calls a stored procedure on server X, inserts it into a table variable, then sends the data as xml to a stored procedure in the database on server Y.p  pBelow is a basically what the code looks likep  precodeGet data from source DECLARE MySourceData TABLE       [ColumnX] VARCHAR50,         [ColumnY] VARCHAR50    INSERT INTO MySourceData EXECUTE [ServerX].SourceDatabase.dbo.[pListData]  DECLARE XmlData XML SELECT      XmlData               SELECT              [ColumnX]               ,[ColumnY]         FROM             MySourceData          FOR XML RAW Item, ROOTItems, ELEMENTS, TYPE       Send data to target EXEC TargetDatabase.dbo.pImportData XmlData codepre  pThis approach keeps any server names or database names within the sql of the job step which we think of as part of configuration, and allows us to abide by our in house development standards of using stored procedures for data access.  While this particular solution is only processing a few thousand records, and the xml wont get that big, if we tried applying it in scenarios where the dataset was larger, how poorly it might scale.

Negative 281 pIve got an iOS app thats using a table view with a search bar added to the table view. When a row is tapped, I push another view controller that shows the details of the row that was tapped. Our table view and detail view both hide the navigation bar.  When the search bar is not active, the navigation bar is disabled on the detail view controller, which is expected. However, when search is active, the navigation bar shows up on the detail view controller. From what Ive read, thats the default behavior for any transitions that occur when search is enabled. Is this accurate If so, is there anything I can do to hide the navigation bar More generally, is there anything I can do to have the push of the detail controller behave the same way regardless of whether search is active or notp

Negative 281 pyeah, I didnt find any coverage of this topic, so I thought Id give it a shot here. Im trying to add a loading animation within an existing function, which returns a list of strings. My code looks like thisp  precodeIoC.GetltIEventAggregatorgt          .PublishOnUIThreadnew ShowWaitingAnimationArgs                        DisplayMessage  Updating database file...,              ShowWaitingAnimation  true                Task.Factory.StartNew gt                ResultList  update.HandledDifferencestestContext, realContext, imo          IoC.GetltIEventAggregatorgt              .PublishOnUIThreadnew ShowWaitingAnimationArgs ShowWaitingAnimation  false            return ResultList codepre  pthe IoC[...] calls are basically just messages sent to a framework, which enable and then disable the loading animation. The actual work is done in update.HandledDifferences function, which basically updates my database file and returns a list of possible error occurences. So right now I want to calculate HandledDifferences and show the loading animation while its calculated so neither UI thread nor this one get blocked, and after its done, I want to return the result  pretty much whats written in that code.  However, since its asynchronous, it doesnt even wait for my ResultList to be calculated, it just returns the value which is in there at the time.p  pI already tried calling the return value of the task and waiting for the task, where both options ended up blocking the UI thread Task.wait sometimes even would block the task itself, so it never got completed and I never got past that line.p  pIm pretty much out of ideas now. I just want to await the task to be completed, but I cant do that because its not a asynchronous method and it cant be made into one it has to implement an interface. Any ideas how to do that Admittedly, Im not really experiences with asynchronous programming, but I couldnt find anything like that anywhere.p

Negative 281 pI understand the main difference between IQueryable and IEnumerable. IQueryable executes the query in the database and returns the filtered results while IEnumerable brings the full result set into memory and executes the filtering query there. p  pI dont think using an extension method to query on the initial assignment of a variable will cause it to be executed in the database like IQueryable, but I just wanted to make sure.p  pThis code will cause the full result set of People to be returned from the database, and then the filtering is done in memoryp  pThe People property on the context is of type DbSetp  precodeIEnumerableltPersongt people  context.People Person person  people.Wherex gt x.FirstName  John codepre  pEven though I am adding the filtering below as an extension method before assigning the item to my variable, Im assuming this code should work the same way as the code above, and bring back the full result set into memory before filtering it, rightp  precodePerson person  context.People.Wherex gt x.FirstName  John codepre  pEDITp  pThanks for the replies guys. I modified the code example to show what I meant removed the IEnumerable in the second paragraph of code.p  pAlso, to clarify, context.People is of type DbSet, which implements both IQueryable and IEnumerable. So I m not actually sure which .Where method is being called. IntelliSense tells me it is the IQueryable version, but can this be trusted Is this always the case when working directly with a DbSet of a contextp

Negative 281 pIm trying to create a small example to hydrate zf2 forms to doctrine entities. You can find my code example at a hrefhttpsgithub.cominbazHydrateExample relnofollowhttpsgithub.cominbazHydrateExampleap  pI generated my doctrine entities by using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjohmuemysqlworkbenchschemaexporter relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjohmuemysqlworkbenchschemaexportera. After that I extend my entities to use MappedSuperclass to be able to do fast changes in mysql workbench without merge my own changes in the entities to the generated files every time.p  pSince these generated entities implement the InputFilterAwareInterface there is already a filter named debitor in my case when it comes to the attachInputFilterDefaults call in ZendFormForm on line 696 using zf2 2.5.1. This leads to not add the filter for my contact collection in my debitor fieldset which results in not having the contact hydrated to the according entity. Because my entities implement InputFilterAwareInterface the InputFilter of the according entity is used instead of the one I defined in my fieldset zf2 ZendFormForm line 812.p  pAdditionally I added the example of DoctrineModule hydrator.md with a BlogPost and Tags which works quite well. But I think the reason for that is that the entities do not implement the InputFilterAwareInterface.p  pIs it possible to use zf2 Form with InputFilterAwareInterface Doctrine entities What do I need to change to make this conjunction work like expectedp  pkind regards Andip
Negative 281 pNew here. So, I was able to figure how to iterate through each element in A and compare it to one element in B.
