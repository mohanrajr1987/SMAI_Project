Positive 2175 pI have an SSIS package that needs to get file size, last modified date, and file name with extension and dump that information into a sql server 2014 table. p  pIm developing using SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2013. So far, Ive created a script task which reads from a sourcedirectory string variable and writes to an object variable. My plan is to create a table within the script, loop through the source directory and pull the desired file properties using fileinfo. Then search that table for only .txt files and sort by filename and place into a separate, sorted table. Then place those values into my object variable. Then loop through the object using a foreach loop container p  pHowever, I cant get this to work. Whenever I execute just the script task I get Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.p  pPlease see below C code. p  precodepublic void Main           Create a dataset.

Positive 2175 pIm new to SSIS but I have experience with c .NET, SSRS, TSQL, and so on. I was handed an old SSIS package and have successfully upgraded it to work in Visual Studio 2013, SQL Server 2014, with project deployment model. Next I want to use project level connection managers. I created a new one and changed all the connections in one of my packages to use it. Then I deleted the old package level connection manager and started getting this error Error at SQL PostExecute to SSISPckgLog [Execute SQL Task] Connection manager oldConnection does not exist. Can someone help me find where PostExecute is located. It is not visible on the Control Flow surface. If I can find it, I can change it so it will use my new project level connection manager.

Positive 2175 pIm attempting to determine the best way, either in SSIS or straight TSQL, to merge two rows based on a given key, but taking specific data from each row based on various aggregate rules MAX and SUM specifically.

My concern there is that is not scalable  it works fine if I have a customer occur only twice in the main dataset, but the goal would be for the logic to work for N number of rows without needing to do a ton of rework. Im sure theres also a TSQL approach that Im missing here. Any help would be appreciated.p

Positive 2175 pI have a table with nearly 10 million records.  We are in dire need to perform a Type 2 data warehouse table and a slowly changing dimension to populate that table.  That is the easy part.p  pThe hard part is, I want to understand how I can ONLY have the SSIS package look at the items where the items modified date is 72 hours or less than the current date this would cause the package to run quickly the second time around.  I can have the Slowly Changing Dimension run off of a view that has this filter in it. BUT I do not want it to expire the records that were not in the last bunch of data. p  pIs there any tutorials hopefully including screen shots of what I can do to make this all happen smoothly  I have searched and searched and have found nothing, but I am pretty sure that this is something very easy to do.p

Positive 2175 pI have recently created a DTS package on our SSIS servers that downloads a file from our SharePoint servers to a local destination, before extracting the Excel data to a SQL database. This is done using a Script Task with the following code.p  precode        string fileUrl  httpenternal.websitelinktofile.xlsx         string tempUrl  localserverdirectoryfile.xlsx          WebClient client  new WebClient         client.Credentials  System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials         client.DownloadFilefileUrl, tempUrl codepre  pThis works well, and weve been using this job for a few weeks, however it seems that today when trying to open the file from SharePoint, we get an error that 256 users are currently accessing this file and as this is the limit, no more users are allowed access. There is only a small team working on this file so its not likely that this is a genuine case of 256 users on it  Im thinking that the code above downloads the file but then doesnt close the connection, meaning that every time this job runs a new user is added.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas about how to adjust the code to close the connection after the download is completep  pThanksp

Positive 2175 pIm attempting to modify an existing SSIS package generated by the ImportExport Wizard 64bit by restamping the query into the package. It calls a database on the same LAN as the calling SQL Server, but is run from a 2nd SQL server, so that the package can be called on demand for loading data from a stored procedure as part of a server job on the calling server. p  pConfig works like this On server where platform data resides MS SQL Server 2008 R2p  ol liDatabase table has subset of fields from our platform, loaded and defined in the designer.li liThere exists a view, which calls the table and imports its data to the viewli liStored Procedure is a complicated union query with a bunch of left outer joins.li ol  pOn calling server MS SQL Server 2008 R2p  ol liImport Export wizard is used to generate SSIS package which sql server job can call on demand and periodically to load the data into the appropriate table and thus, load the view. li liSQL Server job configured to use the package createdmodified to load said data.li ol  pSSIS package does this from calling server p  ol liSource data dbservername, SQL server authenticationli liDestination data dbservername same as above, SQL server authenticationli liQuery Execute NameOfMyStoredProcedure Note existing package is encrypted.li ol  pWhen it gets to this point, it sometimes, but does not always timeout, and has not in the past, until now. The change is the addition of some columns to the SPs query that loads the data. p  pMy Question is there a way [ reg entry, setting value on the database, etc ] to modify the timeout value [ appears to be either 15 or 30 sec ] so that the ImportExport wizard will allow the parsing of the query so that the SSIS package can be parsedp  por alternately,p  pIs there a way to modify the query in design of the SSIS package without going through the importexport wizard Note the calling server does not have the BI studio installed.p

Negative 2175 pIm trying to write a custom JavascriptConverter for use with a WebService Im writing. I have to write a custom converter, because Microsoft.JScript.JSObject doesnt support IDictionary, so it gets treated as an array. I have this part working fine. However, because Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject is a subclass of Microsoft.JScript.JSObject, it also trys to convert it using the same method. How can I return something that will be serialized as a JSON array I have to return an IDictionary, which will become a JSON object. Is there something Im missingp  pSpecifically, how do I return something from Serialize that gets serialized as an Array, not as an Object.p  pThanksp  pEDITp  pI guess I need to be more specific.p  pMicrosoft.JScript.JSObject implements IEnumerable, but not IDictionary. Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject is a subclass of Microsoft.JScript.JSObject. If I create a .asmx in JScript.NET, when I try to return a JSObject, it gets serialized as an array because it implements IEnumerable, but not IDictionary, which means that only the property names in the object get serialized. Of course, If I hand back an ArrayObject, it works properly, and serializes it as an array.p  pSo, I implemented a subclass of JavascriptConverter, which says that its SupportedType is Microsoft.JScript.JSObject. Now, JSObjects get properly serialized. However, because ArrayObject is a subclass of JSObject, JavascriptSerializer no longer takes care of serializing ArrayObjects itself, it hands it off to the JSObject serializer. The question is, how does my custom serializer return something that the JavaScriptSerializer will properly treat as an array, not as an object  Serialize is forced to return an IDictionary, and that gets serialized as an object, not an array.p  pDoes this question make more sensep  pBTW Ive looked at WCF and C instead, but the DataContractJsonSerializer output is completely useless unless youre going to only ever access it using a WCF client Im planning to retrieve it using jQuery.p  pAnswerp  pI finally understood what bdukes was trying to say, and it works You need to tell it its an array when returning the dictionary although this wont work for a toplevel array. Here is the codeSerializecode function that I would up writingp  precode   public override IDictionaryltstring, objectgt Serialize object obj, JavaScriptSerializer serializer          JSObject jsobj  obj as JSObject         Dictionaryltstring, objectgt netdict  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt          if jsobj  null              foreach string prop in jsobj                  object value  jsobj.GetFieldprop, BindingFlags.Default.GetValuejsobj                 switch value.GetType.FullName                      case Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject                         object[] arrobj  IEnumerableMicrosoft.JScript.ArrayObjectvalue.Castltobjectgt.ToArrayltobjectgt                         netdict.Addprop, arrobj                         break                     default                         netdict.Addprop, value                         break                                                return netdict      codepre

Negative 2175 pIm working on a highlyspecialized search engine for my database. When the user submits a search request, the engine splits the search terms into an array and loops through. Inside the loop, each search term is examined against several possible scenarios to determine what it could mean. When a search term matches a scenario, a WHERE condition is added to the SQL query. Some terms can have multiple meanings, and in those cases the engine builds a list of suggestions to help the user to narrow the results.p  pAside In case anyone is interested to know, ambigous terms are refined by prefixing them with a keyword. For example, 1954 could be a year or a serial number. The engine will suggest both of these scenarios to the user and modify the search term to either year1954 or serial1954.p  pBuilding the SQL query and the refine suggestions in the same loop feels somehow wrong to me, but to separate them would add more overhead because I would have to loop through the same array twice and test all the same scenarios twice. What is the better course of actionp

Negative 2175 pI dont use Tcl in my daily work. However, I have a colleague who occasionally interacts with a customer who wishes our tools extension language worked more like Tcl . One topic he brought up was how Tcl let him set how much precision was emstoredem in a double, via a global variable, tclprecision.p  pI did some web searches, and the documentation I found certainly seems to suggest that this is the case rather than just setting the print precision. However, it looks as if tclprecision has had a checkered history. I get the impression that it was removed entirely for a version or two, and then put back, but with warnings and tuttuts about overriding the default value, 0, which really means 17 which the manual promises is enough to represent any IEEE 754 double.p  pSo can anyone tell me more about what tclprecision emactuallyem promises to do, and what effect it has on doubles underthecovers Is it just a global setting for emprintingem numbers, or does it in fact emtruncateem the precision of numbers as stored which seems dangerous to mep
Negative 2175 pfor one of my customers I implemented a site that displays a questionaire.

Negative 2175 pI have read that one of the tradeoffs for adding table indexes in SQL Server is the increased cost of insertupdatedelete queries to benefit the performance of select queries.p  pI can conceptually understand what happens in the case of an insert because SQL Server has to write entries into each index matching the new rows, but update and delete are a little more murky to me because I cant quite wrap my head around what the database engine has to do.p  pLets take DELETE as an example and assume I have the following schema pardon the pseudoSQLp  precodeTABLE Foo  col1 int ,col2 int ,col3 int ,col4 int PRIMARY KEY col1,col2  INDEX IX1 col3 INCLUDE  col4 codepre  pNow, if I issue the statementp  precodeDELETE FROM Foo WHERE col112 AND col2 gt 34 codepre  pI understand what the engine must do to update the table or clustered index if you prefer.  The index is set up to make it easy to find the range of rows to be removed and do so.p  pHowever, at this point it also needs to update IX1 and the query that I gave it gives no obvious efficient way for the database engine to find the rows to update.  Is it forced to do a full index scan at this point  Does the engine read the rows from the clustered index first and generate a smarter internal delete against the indexp  pIt might help me to wrap my head around this if I understood better what is going on under the hood, but I guess my real question is this.  I have a database that is spending a significant amount of time in delete and Im trying to figure out what I can do about it.  p  pWhen I display the execution plan for the deletion, it just shows an entry for Clustered Index Delete on table Foo which lists in the details section the other indices that need to be updated but I dont get any indication of the relative cost of these other indices.  p  pAre they all equal in this case  Is there some way that I can estimate the impact of removing one or more of these indices without having to actually try itp

Negative 2175 pI have a java applet in which I have to display a large amount of items dictionary entries.   The user needs to be able to select individual items in the list, hence it is implemented as a JList.    Generating the list was very quick until I decided to make the display more asthetically pleasing by formatting the individual items using HTML.    Now the list looks pretty but it takes between 10 and 15 seconds to generate it each time the user accesses the dictionary without formatting it occurs almost instantly.   I suppose I could take the performance hit up front by generating the list when the user first enters the application and just hiding and unhiding the list as needed.   But, Im wondering if there is a better way.   Perhaps a more efficient way to generate the list.  p  pHere is the section of code where the slow down occurrs Between the display of C and Dp  precodeDefaultListModel dictCodeModel   new DefaultListModel System.out.printlnC while e.hasMoreElements      String currentEntry       DEntry dentry  DEntry e.nextElement     if filter                          dictCodeModel.addElementdentry.theToken  tokens have embedded html tags   System.out.printlnD codepre  pAs you can see it is pretty simple.    When theToken is formatted as HTML, I get a real performance hit.     Any ideas of what I can do to get around thisp  pThanks,p

When tracing this code, if I on purpose create error 500 it always goes to OnUnload event and gets closed.p  pSo, do you think is this execution safe  emTo stop discussion whether I shouldnt open SQL when I actually need it, answer is that every page which uses BasePage also opens a SQL connection.emp

Negative 2175 pPreface I taught myself how to use Django a couple of years ago, developed a webapp, handed the keys to my clients, and havent had to do much with the app since then, nor have I developed with Django since then.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pA lot of users cannot log in successfully, and this appears to be a persistent problem for those it affects. However, I cannot for the life of me figure out what these users have in common. They use different operating systems, different browsers, access the site at different times of dayweekmonth. Its a reliable failure that doesnt seem to follow a pattern at all.p  pstrongSpecificsstrongp  pThe webapp is running on Windows, Django 1.0, and uses MySQL as the database. Sessions are stored to the database.p  pstrongEliminating Possible Causesstrongp  pIts not a wrong usernamepassword problem, unfortunately. That would be easy. No, the thousands of users of this webapp use the same username and password. Not my preference or choice Furthermore, the failuretoauthenticate is not accompanied by a usernamepassword error message.p  pNow, the site emdoesem work for most of the users. So I know that the basic authentication configuration is correct the codeMIDDLEWARECLASSEScode and codeINSTALLEDAPPScode tuples contain the correct contrib lines. codeLOGINURLcode, codeLOGINREDIRECTURLcode, and codeLOGOUTURLcode are all set correctly. The URL dispatcher works, the views work, etc.p  pThe fact that it is a consistent, ongoing failure for the affected users means that its not a load problem.p  pFor some affected users, using a different browser will fix the problem. For others it does not. And its not necessarily a question of peculiar browser configuration, because a lot of the users who tried second browsers did so by downloadinginstalling a second browser for the first time, presumably using the default configuration. Note that the users are largely not power users.p  pstrongReproducing the Errorstrongp  pThe hardest part of all of this is that I have never had a failed login on any of my computers or browsers, so its impossibly difficult to tackle the debugging process.p  pThe problem is reproducible, though. The primary clients computer, when she is logged in to it and using IE 7 or 8, fails to log in, with the expected behaviour. The hitch it is emnotem reproducible when emIem am logged in to the same computer, regardless of the browser I use.p  pstrongWhy Im Asking Herestrongp  pI do most of my development in PHPMySQL. When Im looking for login problems I look for problems in the usernamepassword, cookies, serverside sessions, browsers, etc. I write debugging code to dump the servercookie variables to the screen, etc.p  pUnfortunately I dont know how to debug Django middleware. I dont even know what type of problem this could possibly be. p  pstrongFinallystrongp  pI have been wracking my brain for days.

I can send over the Order to the ViewModel MVC 3 or ViewData MVC 21 from the controller which works fine, and I can send a collection of Item as well, but how do I display a list of Items that contain both the Item properties and the Quantity from the OrderItem Since both are collections, I could OrderBy ItemID and loop over both at the same time in the view, but that seems really messy.p  pI fiddled with creating an anonymous class that combined both Items and Order but that didnt really work when it came to combining the collections.p  pI basically want to loop through each Item and OrderItem and display the following properties, without doing it in the viewp  pNamebr Descriptionbr Sizebr Quantity  p  pIdeasp
Negative 2175 pIm programing with other people an application to college homework, and sometime we use nonenglish characters in comments or in Strings displayed in the views. The problem is that everyone of use is using a different OS and sometimes different IDEs to program.p  pConcretely, one is using MacOS, another Windows7, and another and me Ubuntu Linux. Furthermore, all of them use Eclipse and I use gedit. We have no idea if Eclipse or gedit are configurable to work propertly with UTF8 bussiness, at least I dont found nothing for mine.p  pThe fact is that what I write with nonenglish characters appears in Windows amp MacOS virtual machines with strange symbols and viceversa , and sometimes, what my nonlinux friends write provokes compilation warnings like this codewarning unmappable character for encoding UTF8code.p  pDo you have any Idea to solve this It is not really urgent but it will be a help.p  pThank you.p

Negative 2175 pOk, im not sure how to put this. But here goes.p  psay i have a database with the tables movie and usermovie, movie holds information on any given movie, and usermovie holds information on the users relationship to the movie.p  pSo, when a user sets the value watched on a given movie, then this results in a table record in usermovie. however, if a user doesnt set any movies as watched, then this would mean that the no movies have been watched and no records are set. so there is this logic already in place. Now i could always have just created a default record for each and every user times the number of movies. but this wouldnt be very effective.p  pso when i try to create a query like, fetch me all movies that the user hasnt watched. that should return me a list of ALL the movies in the database. however, since usermedia doesnt contain any records, it would actually give me an empty list.p  pso is there a solution i could use herep  pIs it possible to get hibernate to return a default entity in the event that the entity doesnt exist or in the event of a left join and the joined value is NULL can i return a default valuep  pmy current backend is mysql. maybe i could create a custom function to deal with this problemp  pEDITp  pusermedia can also hold values like acquired true,false, wishlisted true,false, emotion LOVE,HATE,NULLp  pA requirement for my solution is that i get a list of usermedia joined with movie. Therefore usermedia cant be NULL.p

Negative 2175 pIve just landed in a new code base. While working to make the application to run locally, I noticed I was just getting oneliners for errors in the log and console output  no stack traces. I started searching code and the only thing I could find logged was the exception message. Ditto for chaining exceptions only the message was being retained. I mentioned this to the projects sole developer and asked if it was an intentional design decision. The reply was, in part, I dont think wed gain much from [logging stack traces].p  pFrom years of Java development, I know how valuable stack traces are they tell you which line the exception happened on and you can track how you got there. You read the stack trace and the relevant code and thats probably enough to solve 80 N.B. statistic has no statistical backing of errors you encounter.p  pIm not looking for arguments about what to log or when  thats not the question, and its been covered elsewhere. Really, this just seems like such a fundamental thing to me that I never thought of how to explain it other than that strack traces show you where the error was. I was hoping I could quickly find a quote from emEffective Javaem or the like, but Google hasnt turned up anything so far. p  pAny suggestions of authoritative, convincing sources for descriptions of why you should pay attention to stack tracesp

Negative 2175 pIm wondering what are the best practices to test the interface functionality of a website.p  pIm interested in what methods are available for testing the interface and dynamic generated contents. In particolar I struggle to figure out whether it is possible to create automated tests for actions that require user interaction, or if it is just a waste of time and I should just get some beta tester do this type of work.p  pIll try to give some examplesp  ol lipon SO when you type the title of your new question some related questions appear. Obviously you can implement some sort of test that tells you that you got the correct number of related questions, and that they get displayed, but how do you test the correctness of the links Would you setup a mock set of questions always the same and check that the returned questions are some preestablished ones That would work, sure, but its hardly testing the robustness of your search algorithm. What happens when other questions are added to the pool Are the returned results still relatedpli lipClicking on a certain button a JS is called that generates a popup div, that the user can move around. Again, how do you automatically test this kind of interface You can test for the appearance, but how do you test for the movementpli lipYou have an interface to upload files to the site to embed in your message like the image icon here on SO. So the user is required to 1 press the button 2 browse for the file 3 wait for the upload 4 press OK and finally heshe will see the image in the message. Again, I can see how you can automate the test for the upload e.g. try upload a normal file, then one which is too big, of an unsupported format and so on. But what about the use of the interface If the codeOKcode or the codeBrowsecode buttons dont work for whatever reason its no use that the upload works as, at the end of the day, you still cannot upload your file and see it in your message.pli ol  pObviously all of the above are fairly straightforward to betatest just tell a bunch of users to test your website and theyll notice if anything goes wrong, but can you do and more importantly would you spend time implementing automated tests on this kind of things Also, when beta testing, would you have testers run wild and do whatever they want on the site, or rather tell which functions youd like them to test. Id propend for the 1st but Im open to suggestions.p

Negative 2175 pIm using jQuery and I have the following problemp  pIn my site I have a chessboard with pieces. Every square is a simple div with the background property to show white or black.

Every codepiececodeclass img is a draggable and every codesquarecodeclass div is a droppable. I already have a serverside function that, given a set of coordinates, returns strongVALIDstrong if the movement is valid, and strongINVALIDstrong if otherwise.

Negative 2175 pThis is a trickier problem than it sounds.  I run RubyMySQL on many servers and use mysqldump wo any problems.  However, Im using an Ubuntu setup and it appears to be acting quite different than Fedora and RHEL.  When I backup the production server using mysqldump it causes Rails to become inaccessible.  Apache is still able to serve up images and CPUmemory usage is low, so it appears to be purely a contention with RoR and MySQL.

Negative 2175 pSo when a user comes to my page, there is certain data that I want to store from how they are interacting with the page. None of this data is being persisted though, so Im trying to figure out the best way to do it.p  pFor example, they log onto my page, and Im getting their location through javascriptgoogle maps. Should I store that in the session Im also getting their IP through javascript. Should I just make the javascript query everytime I need to use it or should I store that in the session as wellp  pIs cacheing better than storing things in the session Should I put this all in a codemodelcode, put the codemodelcode in the cache, and then use a codeGuidcode to retirve the right codemodelcode for the right user in the cache Would this get crazy expensive if thousands of users were on the page at oncep  pUsers are also able to get a list of records from the database using this information that Im gathering as params to a stored proc. This list sometimes needs to be requeried for, but other times, it just needs to be resorted on the page. I wouldnt want to query for all of these everytime Im just sorting through it, but would the cache be able to hold like thousands of records in it for each user logged inp  pIve just never came across this stuff in MVC before so I could use a little guidance.p  pThanks guys.p

For small and simple boards, I get the desired results the script solves the puzzle correctly, but for larger and full boards i.e. all slots but one occupied I get a php timeout. I need to get it to work with a 7x7 board, with the following layoutp  precodex x 1 1 1 x x x x 1 1 1 x x 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 x x 1 1 1 x x x x 1 1 1 x x codepre  pWhere x is unusable, 1 is a slot with a peg and 0 is a free slot.p  pThe board is represented by 7x7 array an array of arrays. I traverse it one key at a time, doing the following checksp  pIs this keys value 1 If yes, is the following keys value 1 too and the following 0  which means theres a peg to take, and theres a space to move the first one. If yes, then I create a copy of the board and apply these changes, and resend it to the function. If not, I check in another direction currently checking order is right, left, up, down. p  pRecursion ends when the script cant find a valid path from that position. Then, I do a check to see if theres only one peg left which would mean that the board is solved, or if there are pegs left which would mean that the board wasnt solved. In the latter, the whole path should be discarded.p  pI would copyamppaste my code, but as its still a little messy I preferred to explain it.p  pI tried strongRodolphe Courtiersstrong algorithm a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgrcourtiepegsolitairesrctippegsolitaire.php relnofollowherea, with the same results.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrong Ok, so far making the DFS nonrecursive didnt quite help there are still a lot of steps involved. So now Im thinking about checking the board for patterns that yield a unsolvable puzzle first, and if thats the case I instruct the script not to bother traversing it in the first place. As before, will post my findings.p

Negative 2175 pAs a followup to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6443607escapingcharactersbydoublingtheminphpprevious questiona where I asked for a solution to a broken problem, Im trying to find a way to express an arbitrary identifier in a readable way.p  pContext we are working with ementitiesem domain model objects from a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDomaindrivendesign relnofollowDDDa, which have an emidentityem. This identity mapped to a database primary key can be expressed as a string code123code, codeABCcode.p  pSome ementitiesem can have a emcompound identityem, i.e. composed of two or more other entities emidentityem codearray123,ABCcode.p  pSometimes, we want to prettyprint this emidentityem, or to use it in a place where just a single string is allowed for example, in an HTML codeltoptiongtcode value. The process has to be predictable and reversible, i.e. there should be no ambiguity in how to reverse it back to its original state.p  pWhen we want to humanread this emidentityem, for debugging purposes, its easier to read code123code, codeABCcode, or code123ABCcode rather than codea2i0s3123i1s3ABCcode, thats why we dont want to use builtin functions such as codeserializecode or codejsonencodecode.p  pjsonencode does a pretty good job, but when it comes to use it in HTML, where quotes have to be properly encoded, it becomes quite unreadablep  precodeltoption value[ampquot123ampquot,ampquotABCampquot]gt codepre  pWhere we could use a nice format just like this onep  precodeltoption value123ABCgt codepre  pWhen posting the HTML form, we have to be able to revert this encoded emidentityem to its original state codearray123,ABCcode to retrieve the correct ementityem.p  pFinally, it is perfectly acceptable that the format becomes complicated to humanly read if the emidentityem contains other chars than letters and figures.p  pSome basic examplesp  pcode123code  code123codebr  codeABCcode  codeABCcodebr  codearray123,ABCcode  code123ABCcode just an ideap  pcodestring with nonalphanumeric, even nonsc charcode  codecodep  pAny more or less complicated representation is acceptable for strings containing other chars.

Negative 2175 pEditp  h3Apologies for previous generalityh3  pI hereby try to be clearer. I am testing an image, so I am to write a number of methods which will run to analyse the image.  Not all images tested will be the same, and so I want an object for each image. Many of the methods I am to write dont run on all of the image.  For example, I have a method which returns the distance of an array point from the centre of the image, using a pixel spacing constant which is an attribute of the image.  Here I have an example, I read an image and thereby create the object image, and some attributes which will be useful to me.  But my point objects, which belong in that image, wont have access to those attributes if they have a class of their own it is useful to have a point class, because other analysis also uses points, and uses the same methods.p  precode    class imageobject     def initself, filepath     creates an instance of the image from filepath         xscale  self.readheaderxspacing         xscale  self.readheaderyspacing pixels per mm property of image      class pointobject     def initslef, i,j     self.i  i  array position in image.     self.j  j     self.x  self.i  xscale real position in mm in image     self.y  self.i  yscale but xscale and y scale are not in scope here. codepre  pSo the question is... how do I give point objects attributes like distance that depend on image attribute like xscale and yscale.  In my mind i want image.point.x to be allowed, where image.point.x is depended to image.xscale. The slight complication, which I think we can probably ignore for now, is that a point should not be allowed to exist outside of the context of an image, because it wont mean anything to have the point with out the image attributes, like scale. I hope that is clearer, and generally more useful.   Thank you.p  h3Origional question.h3  pId like to have an open image.  The image should be an object, as plenty of methods are associated with it.. e.g. reading header info and giving the object lots of attributes like title, sizex, sizey... p  pThen the images are made up of points, obviously  so I thought Id have a points class.  I could then define a Point object, and it could have attributes, like position depending on some pixel spacing constants from the image header.  And this class would have lots of point methods, like distance, change value, move, scale, polt between two points.... etcp  pMy problem is two fold.  The creation of point objects should really depend on the existance of the image object.  I dont know how python handles this kind of conditional creation of objects.  And second, The point object must be aware of the image object that it is relavent to.  Ideally, I would have Image.Pointx,y and that would mean that the point x,y exists within the image, and so it could have access to all the varialbes created when the image object was initialised.  I hope all that makes sense.  I have tried super, but it doesnt seem to do the conditional bit, and it runs a method in the base class, where I really just want to have some variables availalbe.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 2175 pI have been able to successfully encrypt and decrypt AES256 in both php and objectivec code. I wont post any code here since I have tried many varieties and none work. I have no idea how these encryption functions work... AES is a standardized algorithm, so why it doesnt work in my thinking boils down top  pa the ivbr b some encoding errorbr orbr c differences in padding should be irrelevant for decryption.p  pIf someone has AES functions that work in both php and objectivec that would be wonderful, but if not, any help in understanding what is causing these varied results would be appreciated.p  pIf you want a more narrow question, it is about encodings, iv, and block size of this AES cipher.p  p1 Does it matter what encoding is used in terms of the key and the plaintextciphertext Basically Im guessing it is not a problem with the plain text since all the characters that I would use at least during testing are standard ASCII symbols. But lets say php strings are ASCII and I am using UTF8 in objectivec... I dont know enough to say if php uses ASCII or if the bytes ie. the key would be different between the two.p  p2 To my knowledge the ECB mode uses no iv correct if wrong. CBC mode uses an iv. In this case, the iv must be recorded along with the cipher text. Now this key is 16 or 32 chars long in php depending on 128 vs 256 block size. This means 16 or 32 bytes And will the string 1234567890123456789012 be the same in ASCII and UTF8 when converted to bytesp  p3 What is the difference between block size and key size in terms of the alogrithm again correct if wrong Basically they are all the same algorithm just different parameters And using a 256 bit key vs a 128 bit key is just a matter of which key is passedp  pAlso, note that I have been using base64 encoding to transfer strings between the applications for testingp  pThanks, Elijahp
Negative 2175 pIm a student programmer and I am using Qt to build some GUI applications for work and I have been running into moc issues over and over again. I was hoping for a solution to the current problem that I am having however, if anyone more veteraned in Qt could shed some light on how to properly handle these files while making changes to your cpp files Id appreciate any help. In my most recent change sorry I cant post what it did look like, because its obviously been restructured I was validating data by nesting a function inside of my checkData function.

Negative 2175 pI need a little help regarding WCF Services. Situation is something like this, I have made a website project in .net 4.0 and then I added a SilverlightEnabled WCF service with the name AdminService.svc. I wrote a few methods in this service, of course, made them [OperationContracts]. Then I created another Silverlight 5.0 project in the same workspace and tried to consume the service AdminService.svc, added its reference in this project We have to keep in mind that AdminService is running in another website type project in the same workspace. But now everytime I run the application and try to call a method which simply return some data, I get this error p  pAn error occurred while trying to make a request to URI p  blockquote   phttplocalhost2850XYZServicesAdminService.svc. This could be   due to attempting to access a service in a crossdomain way without a   proper crossdomain policy in place, or a policy that is unsuitable   for SOAP services. You may need to contact the owner of the service to   publish a crossdomain policy file and to ensure it allows   SOAPrelated HTTP headers to be sent. This error may also be caused by   using internal types in the web service proxy without using the   InternalsVisibleToAttribute attribute. Please see the inner exception   for more details.p blockquote  pObvious answer to this problem is to add a crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml, right I have both of them in place in my wcf website type project at the root level with the following content,p  pclientaccesspolicy.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt ltaccesspolicygt   ltcrossdomainaccessgt     ltpolicygt       ltallowfrom httprequestheadersgt         ltdomain urigt       ltallowfromgt       ltgranttogt         ltresource includesubpathstrue pathgt       ltgranttogt     ltpolicygt   ltcrossdomainaccessgt ltaccesspolicygt codepre  pand the other onep  pcrossdomain.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltDOCTYPE crossdomainpolicy SYSTEM httpwww.macromedia.comxmldtdscrossdomainpolicy.dtdgt ltcrossdomainpolicygt   ltallowhttprequestheadersfrom domain headersgt ltcrossdomainpolicygt codepre  pKindly help me out of this, its becoming troublesome now.p

Meanwhile, the table focus will jump to the top left cell leaving the recently edited cells editor open.p  pWhen this happens, arrow keys will navigate the tables focus, but other keys will type into the editor.p  pIve tried calling the CloseEditor event on the gridview in the repository editors Validating event as well as the Cell Value changed event, but with no results.  Has this happened to anybody elsep
Negative 2175 pIm using jQuery to create an interactive map. If you click on any of the 6 locations to the left of the map, the map will pan to them and a label with their name appears by the marker. I know my code is quite messy but this is for demo purposes only. So far its all working fine  p  pa hrefhttpsmartpeopletalkfast.co.ukgmap2 relnofollowhttpsmartpeopletalkfast.co.ukgmap2ap  pTheir is some additional functionality. When you click on a marker in the map itself, the name should appear by the marker, and the location name to the left of the map should become bold. This is happening on firefox and chrome but nothing happens on iPad and iPhone. p  pIve read about issues with using jQuerys live on iOS but ive tried the workarounds without luck. Thanks p

Negative 2175 pI have implemented the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDiamondsquarealgorithm relnofollow titlediamondsquare algorithmdiamondsquare algorithma and I would like to store the map data in a file format. Im mostly a beginner in C, or at least in file reading and writing, so I have problem where to store a lot of data.p  pFor example if I create a 6565 map, then its 16384 triangles, and each got 3 coordinates, 3 normal coordinates. Of course I can divide it for example to 4 3232 map piece, but its still many. Of course what really matters is the speed, there is no problem to write all the data in txt, but it is really slow, especially when I increase the map size.p  pI not really need a source, but something to read or learn from it.p

Negative 2175 pI am trying to figure out how to update of UI elements UIImageViews based upon the content of user event callbacks that are invoked when a user event is passed during MIDI playback. More specifically, these user events contain note data e.g. played note is 60, aka middle C that is passed into the user callback function.p  pI want to update my UIImageViews based upon what note is played. I have tried to access the UIImageViews from within the callback but since it doesnt have direct access to the ViewController and since it runs on a thread other than the main one, I have been advised to do it a different way.p  pSo, what I would like to do is to create a separate controller that can relay information from the callback function to the UI but I have no idea who to go about doing that.

However, I have published the app and am seeing different kinds of error reports caused by this library on various phones, particularly when the Activity is resumed i.e. it seems the Activity which has the Fragments cant resume itself on some phones without force closing. Below Ive pasted some trimmed stack traces to serve as example. Really irritated by this because I cant replicate it on the devices I have.

Negative 2175 pNeed to design a simple one for school.  More specifically a Moore FSM. Im not sure how state transitions happen, is it next state each clock I need to know because im wondering if i can shift a register and add a value to it, all in the same state... Could use wave edgesp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have to design the strongALUstrong part with registers as a schematic from gatelevel, so no target strongCPUstrong.p  pI made the algorith diagram, then put states to function blocks according strongMoore FSMstrong rules. each block of operations gets one state. p  pFor instance in a state strongemS1emstrong, i have the following operations strongemy0  shift Reg1 left y1  Reg1  Reg1  Reg2emstrong. So the microcommand that the control part of Moore strongFSMstrong outputs would be strongem0000011 yn...y1,y0.emstrong this microcommand should be the input to the ALU part which i need to design. Now i realized strongy1,y0strong will conflict eachother, since both are using strongReg1.strong p  pIts problematic since I dont actually have the Control part, I have to imagine the core FSM and design only the ALU with registers. This is why i was wondering if i get more than one clock cycle, so i can sequence strongy0,y1strong or do i have to complete the entire operation in one clockp  pI plan on making parallelin, parallelout nonshift registers, obviously i cant do the two operations of the microcommand at the same time. So what can i do p  precode1. make extra states which i really dont want to do 2.use edges of a single clock might cause problems 3.Assume i get a preset amount of ticks from the clock to complete the microcommand  This would make the most sense, but i dont know if its the case. The control unit does know the algorithm and thus how many operations need to be performed codepre  pI have to note again, that the control part is totally abstract and i have no idea how this is handled in practice. p

Negative 2175 pi am after some advicestrategy on limiting http requests when consuming multiple web services. I feel i could do this if the requests were happening synchronously, but they are asynchronous and think i should try to perform the limit logic in a way that i wont block.p  pDue to the web app consuming multiple web services there will be different limits for different requests.

Negative 2175 pI am extending a scheduling app that displays multiple Fullcalendars in agendaDayView to show the days schedule for multiple people.  Having each Fullcalendar use its own scrollbar has been rejected accordingly, all the calendars are displayed fulllength, with a single scrollbar set in the surrounding div.p  pThe problem now is to have the headers stay fixed during vertical scrolling.  There are other requirements for extended header functionality additional data, icons, links, etc., so it made more sense to me to make my own headers above each Fullcalendar div.p  pUsing CSS and placing the divs correctly, I was able to get the calendars to vertically scroll separately from the headers, thus achieving a fixed header effect.  The problem was then horizontal scrolling  if I made the divs extend outward horizontally, then the vertical scrollbar for the div containing the calendars was all the way to the right, outside of visibility.p  pI have also tried plugins for fixed headers by setting using a  with arbitrary text for the headers and then putting the Fullcalendar divs inside  elements in a single row.  These all failed in different ways hiding the calendars, reprinting the headers, other ways.p  pHere is the base setup  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjzqJC relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjzqJCa.

Negative 2175 pIm building a real time data system that allows an ApachePHP server to send data to my Node.js server, which will then immediately send that data to the associated client via socket.io.  So the ApachePHP server makes a request that includes the data, as well as a user token that tells Node.js which user to send the data to.p  pRight now this is working fine  Ive got an associative array that ties the users socket.io connection to their user token.  The problem is that I need to start scaling this to multiple servers.  Naturally, with the default configs of socket.io I cant share connections between node workers.p  pThe solution I had in mind was to use the RedisStore functionality, and just have each of my workers looking at the same Redis store.  Ive been doing research and theres a lot of documentation on how to use pubsub functionality for broadcasting messages to large groups rooms.  Thats fine, but I need to be able to send messages to a single client, so I need some way to retrieve a users socket.io connection from the RedisStore.p  pThe only way I can think to do this right now is to create a ton of rooms named with the users token, and only have one user in each room.  Then I could just emit to that room.  However, that seems very inefficient.p  pIs there a better way that I can retrieve users unique socket.io connections from Redisp

Negative 2175 pIm stuck with a weird problem which is probably my lack of knowledge, I present the offending codep  precodetry      f.Delete     fTemp.MoveTof.FullName     Console.WriteLineINFO Old file deleted new file moved in gt 0, f.FullName  catch IOException ex      Console.WriteLineERROR Output file has IO exception gt 0, f.FullName     Environment.ExitCode  1  codepre  pf and fTemp are FileInfo objects. So if I run this with code where f is a video file playing in a mediaplayer it throws the exception. That works fine and as expected. Now when I close the mediaplayer it deletes the file Even though my application is long closed. Even when I close Visual Studio it still deletes the file, when I close the mediaplayer. As if some callback is being setup somewhere to make sure the file gets deleted at some point. This offcourse in unwanted behaviour.

Negative 2175 pThese days, Ive been messing around with the ObjectiveC runtime, trying to find out how some things work. In one of my experiments, I did the following I got the following code which is in a file called codetest.mcodep  precodeimport ltobjcObject.hgt  interface MySuperClass Object    int myMessage1 end  interface MyClass MySuperClass      int myIvar  void myMessage2 end  implementation MyClass void myMessage2    myIvar  end  int main      MyClass myObject     myObject  [[MyClass alloc] init]     [myObject myMessage2]      return 0  codepre  pand tried to compile it with codeclang fobjcnonfragileabi fnextruntime o test test.mcode. As you can imagine, the compiler will generate a linking error message because Im compiling an ObjectiveC file, but Im not telling the linker to link it against an ObjectiveC runtime library with the codelobjccode option, for example. But I did that on purpose, to check out which objc runtime library symbols would be referenced and, thus, would be missing. And I got the following error messagep  precode clang fobjcnonfragileabi fnextruntime o test test.m  tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x0 undefined reference to OBJCMETACLASSObject tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x8 undefined reference to OBJCMETACLASSMySuperClass tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x10 undefined reference to objcemptycache tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x18 undefined reference to objcemptyvtable tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x30 undefined reference to OBJCCLASSMySuperClass tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x38 undefined reference to objcemptycache tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcdata0x40 undefined reference to objcemptyvtable tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcmsgrefs, coalesced0x0 undefined reference to objcmsgSendfixup tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcmsgrefs, coalesced0x10 undefined reference to objcmsgSendfixup tmptestjEfgSA.oDATA, objcmsgrefs, coalesced0x20 undefined reference to objcmsgSendfixup clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation codepre  pIts easy to understand why some of the listed symbols are undefined. codeobjcmsgSendfixupcode, for example, refers to a runtime library function. codeobjcemptycachecode and codeobjcemptyvtablecode are both runtime library structs declared in a hrefhttpopensource.apple.comsourceobjc4objc4532runtimeobjcabi.h relnofollowhttpopensource.apple.comsourceobjc4objc4532runtimeobjcabi.ha. However, codeOBJCMETACLASSMySuperClasscode and codeOBJCCLASSMySuperClasscode are structs that represent a class that has been declared in codetest.mcode, so that there is no reference in the ObjectiveC runtime library to these symbols. They should be defined in codeteste.ocode, but it seems theyre not. So, why does this happenp  pAnd one more thing there is no broken reference to neither codeOBJCMETACLASSMyClasscode nor codeOBJCCLASSMyClasscode. Therefore, there are broken references to codeObjectcode and codeMySuperClasscode and both of them have subclasses in codetest.mcode, but there is no broken reference to codeMyClasscode, which has no subclass. So, why the linker seems to expect there to be references,  in the runtime library, to the classes that have subclasses, but not to those that havent anyp

Negative 2175 pI have a set of large CSV files with many columns each that I need to import into a SQL Azure database.  Ordinarily I would use the import wizard in SQL Server Management Studio.  However, the wizard does not appear to be an option when connecting to SQL Azure in SSMS.  Is that correct And if so, what is the recommended tool for accomplishing this task Im looking for a tool that will infer from the data what the columns should be allowing me to override the data type as needed.  Since I have a lot of columns in each of the files Id like to avoid the tedious work of manually writing the SQL code to generate the tables.p

We are a very large retailer and already have ties with google products.p  pI still do not know much about Google App Engine development.  From what i understand it seems that you have to develop with their Java SDK.  Meaning your applications must be developed specifically for their hosting platform. I am not about to give up Grails, so am hesitant. p  pSo questionsp  ol liI would like to know if anyone has experance with trying to integrate Grails applications into Google AppEngine li liIs it possible to simply push a Grails project packaged as a war into Google AppEngine  li liI found this a hrefhttpwww.grails.orgpluginappengine relnofollowGrails AppEngine plugina.

Negative 2175 pI have the following architecture for my appp  pjQueryMobile web app  Gets JSON from  REST API created in Cp  pI have placed the REST API Code in a virtual directory in IIS 6. The Mobile site code is running in the root of the website... so the rough file structure is like thisp  pre  inetpub      index.html     myjavascript.js      restapi       web.config       Global.asax       binbunch of Dlls...  pre  pThe Server is behind a network with the following sort of IP translation not the real IPs... For examplep  pre Web Server external IP  121.131.141.50  with URL httpmysite.com Internal IP             10.210.2.5 Subnet                  255.255.255.0 pre  pI have tried restricting access to the coderestapicode folder by IP as I would like for it only to be accessible from the web server.  I have tried the IIS approach and set Directory Security settings, and have also tried the approach of using a codeServiceAuthorizationManagercode class to check Request IP in the Http Request.br Both approaches gave me the same result There was no problem restricting and testing the actual service call through Fiddler to prove that a 401 would be thrown from any IP other than the web server IP 10.210.2.5.  I was also able to execute it from the webserver which is the desired setup.p  pHowever, once the Mobile site javascript calls it, I get the 401 unauthorized. As the Javascript code is client side, the restapi assumes that the call is coming from the Clients IP address, which of course, is blocked.p  pIs there a neat way to check that the call comes from the IP where JavaScript is sitting  p  pOr Is there a better way to go about the whole thing   Is there a way to make the web app specifically permitted to access the coderestapicode virtual directory p

Negative 2175 pThis might be deleted, since involves idea sharing which is not quite allowed in stack overflow, but still before that if I could get any ideas from solid programmers, it will be a win situation for mep  pAssume that you have a class bStudentb, stored in the database, and this class has a list property called bfavoriteTeachersb. This list constantly gets updated by the system and involves the id of teachers.p  pYou also have a class bTeacherb, also stored in database and likewise has a list property bfavouriteStudentsb. It is again updated constantly and involves the ids of students.p  pIn our system, when a student calls a function lets say bnotMyFavoriteTeacherb, our system has to apply the changes belowp  ol liDelete the given teachers id from favouriteTeacher listli liDelete the students id from given teachers favouriteStudent listli ol  pIve tried to consider the number of rows updated could exhaust the database so instead of mapping the students with their favorite teachers in a separate table as buserid, teacheridb, instead I created a column and stored a string which contains the teachers ids separated by comma. Ex 1,2,14,4,25. Same applied for the bteacherb as well. p  pHowever when we call this function, we also face another problem. In order for this operation to be done, you need to convert the string to list, find the element by linear search and later on delete, and later on convert list to string and push back to db. And you have to do the other operation for the bteacherb class as well. If we bdid notb apply the string method, deletion would be easier but since we would be handling deletion and addition operations for like 2k times a day, i did not think it would be bfeasibleb to use separate tables.p  pI wanted to ask in order to decrease the number of operations, could a data structure be chosen such that it would increase the befficiencybp

Negative 2175 pIm trying to hash some values and use the hashed value as an index in my database. Not having collisions is very important, which is why Im going with md5. Having 128 bits, gives me more than the space I need to not worry about collisions I know that md5 is not collision safe.p  pAnyways, how can I store the result of the md5 in a database and so that I can index it and retrieve it quickly I was thinking of having two Long variables where one would hold the value of the first 64 bits and the other the second 64 bits and use both keys as an index on my database. But I need a fast way for doing this... what would be the fastest way p  pI dont think storing the md5 hashed value as a byte array will help much when I need indexing. p

Negative 2175 pSo far Ive managed to connect to a Web Service and get my SoapObject response, but Im having  trouble narrowing down a good, clean way of parsing. Searching the Internet hasnt really yielded much results, everyone has a different way and different process usually geared towards their own Web Service making it a one time use type of solution. Basically, below is the response that I get from a Web Servicep  precodeanyType  schemaanyType   elementanyType    complexTypeanyType     choiceanyType      elementanyType       complexTypeanyType        sequenceanyType         elementanyType             elementanyType              elementanyType                elementanyType                 diffgramanyType          NewDataSetanyType           Repx0020InformationanyType             LoginCorrectLogin PasswordInCorrectPass     codepre  pAnd basically I want to be able to parse out just the two important fields Login and Password. From what I read I tried just iterating through the SoapObject response based on the property count but that doesnt seem to work. When I tried I get a property count of 2 for the response so instead I ended up doing some thing like this below p  precodeSoapObject responseSoapObject envelope.getResponse                  if  response  null                      Log.iMessage, the response contains   response.toString                     SoapObject diffgram  SoapObject response.getPropertydiffgram                     SoapObject NewDataSet  SoapObject diffgram.getPropertyNewDataSet                     SoapObject RepInfo  SoapObject NewDataSet.getPropertyRepx0020Information                     for int i  0 i lt RepInfo.getPropertyCount i                          PropertyInfo info  new PropertyInfo                         RepInfo.getPropertyInfoi, info                         Log.dInfo, info.name      RepInfo.getPropertyi.toString                         which gives the following message in LogCat   DInfo716 Login  InCorrectLogin   DInfo716 Password  InCorrectPass codepre  pThis process works, as by the last loop I get the two objects I want but I just feel like theres a cleaner way of doing this. I only ask because as I get further into this App there will be some more complex Web Service calls being made and I want to be able to have something that is reusable throughout the app instead of having to build several SoapObjects for each request just to get down to the objects I want. p

Negative 2175 pIt strongfinallystrong occurred to me that you are supposed to code up an codeActivityMappercode to parseinspect the codePlacecode subclass that its codegetActivityPlacecode method is passed, and to return the appropriate codeActivitycode to present to the user.p  pSo this got me thinking it makes sense that you need many different codePlacecode subclasses in your app, each representing a different bookmarkable URLstate.p  pBut why would an app ever need more than 1 codeActivityManagercode and codeActivity Mappercode It seems that there is no GWTimposed restriction as to which codePlacecode gets mapped to which codeActivitycode...p  pIve heard some strategies where each display region gets its own codeActivityManagercode. It seems too me like this just makes your project more complicated without providing any emrealem benefits. Thanks in advancep

In codeValidationSummarycode there should be 1 error message for each column in which at least 1 validator fails.p  pThe problem is that codeValidationSummarycode will show the same message for each row in which a validation fails which is expected behavior, but it would be nice to be able to remove the duplicate error messages.p  pExample, assuming 2 rows and no data enteredp  blockquote   pFirst name is requiredp      pFirst name is requiredp      pLast name is requiredp      pLast name is requiredp blockquote  pInstead of the desired behaviourp  blockquote   pFirst name is requiredp      pLast name is requiredp blockquote  pOne solution I found is to use a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary9eee01cx28vvs.7129.aspx relnofollowCustomValidatora outside the codeRepeatercode for each column and place them in the same codeValidationGroupcode as the codeValidationSummarycode but I am thinking there must be a better solution.p

Negative 2175 pI am new to programming and was asked a question in a test, although I failed the test. I wanted to find out the answer and proceed with more learning. The question isp  pA singlethreaded application has need of an asynchronous processing mechanism.  The design chosen is a cooperative multitasking system, where Task objects, driven by a master object, encapsulate potentially long running operations.  The design calls for the master to manage running tasks, calling an update function on each Task object when that task is to run.  In turn, the Task object needs to regularly check with the master during this update function to see if it needs to return control back to the master, postponing more processing until next update.p  pA piece of code using this system should be able to create a Task object, passing in any initial state, and then should be able to query that Task object to determine whether it is finished and, if so, what the results of the operation were.  The caller will hold onto the Task object pointer to query it for completion and to obtain results.p  pHeres the definition of the parts of the master object that can be used by the Task objectp  pmaster classp  precodePublic Interfaces ListTask  Adds a task to be managed by the master.  Takes a Task object as a parameter.  Returns a Boolean true if successful.  TaskComplete  Should be called by a managed Task when it is complete.  Takes a Task object as a parameter.  Doesnt return anything.  TaskStatus  Must be called regularly by a Task during Task update.  Takes a Task object as a parameter.  Returns a Boolean true if Task update should return immediately, false if OK  to keep running codepre  pDesign the Task class for this system.  Implement a task that determines whether a given balanced binary tree is actually balanced or not.  The node structure for this tree is as followsp  precodeNode Structure Data Node Data Integer Left Child Node Right Child Node codepre

Also, while starting the webapplication, it causes some browsers Dolphin on my HTC One X to crash and on the others ones it takes ages to load.

Negative 2175 pso in the a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgguideconceptsinjector relnofollowAngularJS docsa I saw this about the injectorp  precode You write functions such as this one. function doSomethingserviceA, serviceB     do something here.    Angular provides the injector for your application var injector  ...    the oldschool way of getting dependencies. var serviceA  injector.getserviceA var serviceB  injector.getserviceB   now call the function doSomethingserviceA, serviceB    the cool way of getting dependencies.  the injector will supply the arguments to the function automatically injector.invokedoSomething  This is how the framework calls your functions codepre  pit looks nice. but i dont get it. in the last line where the injector looks for dependencies, isnt it exactly like having global variables serviceA, serviceB I mean, say I would rewrite it like thisp  precodevar serviceA, serviceB  function doSomething      access serviceA, serviceB  codepre  pwhat is the benefit of having the injector do that I mean, if he can magically find the right objects for the arguments, doesnt it mean I can find them just as easily if they are global variablesp  pI hope my question is clear...p

Negative 2175 pI have a page that serves two purposes, mostly viewing an entry in the database, but some of the fields are displayed in textfieldstextareas because you can edit some values and then depending on the button you select at the bottom, you can update those entries.  I especially like the textarea because of its lookfeel, naturally resizeable in the page, and comes with standard rightclick options like SelectAll, etc. thx to browser support.  p  pAnyway, one of those fields shown in a textarea Id like to prevent from coming through upon postback because that value isnt going to be edited Ive even made it readonly so you cant even edit the textarea.p  pHow to accomplish preventing form postback for an input from the ASPX page  I know that is counterintuitive in general, but I thought perhaps theres a way similar to the Hidden inputs.  Also, I know that in the controller I could just wipe that field in the model before doing anything with the model submitted from the form, but Im curious if there is some option from the page that I could do.p  pIm using this syntax to define the textareabrp  precodelt Html.TextAreaFormodel gt model.Key, new  readonly  readonly, class  readonly, cols  62, rows  15 gt codepre  pbEDITbbr I probably should have noted that one of the main reasons I need to do this is because one of the model fields may contain some HTML in it.  This is an internal website and that field cannot be edited manually, so no one can input HTML, it is just a value in the database that comes from a license generation program.  And so, when I use a TextArea in a form that is bound to a model field, ASP.NET throws an exception upon binding the TextArea data back to the model to send upon postback.p  pI saw the SO answers using [AllowHtml] and [ValidateInputfalse] attributes, one wasnt available to me in MVC2 and the other requires downgrading the requestValidationMode, so I am looking for an alternative way to prevent the possible HTML value from being posted back at all but still displayed in a textarea.p

Negative 2175 pI been trying to think of a way to change the font size as the parent element sizes changes. Most likely this would be due by the browser size being changed.

Media queries great for detecting what device being used and all, but not how I want it to be.

Negative 2175 pI have searched high and low for this answer. I have tried suggestions to similar problems posted on Stack and other sites. My toolchain consists of an x64 machine with windows 7, visual studio 2010, opencv 2.4, qt 4.8, and boost. I configure all of my projects using CMake, which finds all of these libraries and includes and creates my visual studio project. I have compiled two versions of boost, a 32bit version build in the command line and placed in boostboost1470libwin32, and a 64bit compiled in the Windows SDK v7.1 64bit compiler and stored in boostboost1470libx64.

What I do is click various links on my web page which will open new windows.  For my test, I opened the initial browser from my debugger and from my main page I spawned 5 other browsers.  The call above executes immediately from the window started by my debugger but when I view the request from the network capture it will sit saying Pending until it eventually timedout.p  pNow the interesting part is that if I close any one of those windows I spawned, the request will change from pending and go to my controller and return as expected.  With a little more playing around, if I try it again not opening additional browsers it will always get sent to the server immediately, but if I open that 5th browser, then it becomes slow again.  I did various tests to make sure nothing was wrong with specific windows, it seems to be that magic number of 5 browsers that causes my request to not be sent.p  pHere is a screenshot of my successful request when I close the 5th browser window. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwTJWu.png altSuccessp  pHere is a capture of my request headers img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMwGZ3.png altenter image description herep  pHere is a capture of my response headers img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com41RDs.png altenter image description herep  pHere is a capture of my timings img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn9qmV.png altenter image description herep  pThe main thing I cant really understand is why there is a 46 second wait period and then two start periods.

Negative 2175 pI am currently running iPython on two separate computers a laptop running Mac OS 10.7.5 and a desktop running Mac OS 10.8.4 and would like to install Cython to speed things up. On my laptop everything went smoothly I downloaded Cython then ran the codepython setup.py installcode command from the Cython directory and Cython installed immediately.p  pHowever, things are not going quite so smoothly on my desktop. The first issue was that I did not previously have gcc on the computer. However, downloading the latest version of Xcode should have solved that problem. Now when I run the codepython setup.py installcode command, everything works fine until the install starts codebuilding Cython.Plex.Scanners extensioncode from within the codepython.pycode file located in my iPython directory. The issue is that the command which the install automatically inputs reads code A p p l i c a t i o n s  X c o d e . a p p  C o n t e n t s  ...  u s r  b i n  c l a n gcode and so on. I then get an error message which reads codecommand  failed with exit status 1code. Clearly the issue is the added white space in the directory path.p  pI do not know why this white space is there and I do not know how to tell the computer to look in the proper directory the one without the spaces. If anybody could please help it would be greatly appreciated. I should also note that I did not have this problem on my laptop because the proper executables were located directly in my codeusrbincode directory. I do not trust that I know enough about what Im doing to manually move the proper executables from within the Xcode package contents to the codeusrbincode directory, though that seems like a possible solution.p

Negative 2175 pIm trying to test a device that will not use proxy for http. Id like to return a 404 status code on traffic to a certain host  normally I would utilize a proxy and mangle the responses.  In this case Im not able to use a proxy. HTTP packet sniffing in the absense of a proxy is easy enough with wire shark or httpscoop however I cant actually mangle any of the traffic without getting in the middle.p  pIs it possible to easily arp spoof and modify the response Im guessing Id have to either write something fairly custom to do this which does sound like fun OR I could find another solution like dropping all traffic to the ip using iptable rules or similar.p  pEdit This is a common problem on android testing so Im adding a tag. I answered the question a hrefhttpmitmproxy.orgdoccertinstallandroid.html relnofollowhttpmitmproxy.orgdoccertinstallandroid.htmla This will do it via transparent http proxying. You use a router eg iptables or pf to proxy the traffic.p

Negative 2175 pI have developed a site with MVC4, jQuery and Twitter Boostrap. Now I decided to add knockout to some pages in order to make the workflow more fluent. On this particular page the intention  is to have a list of items to the left that can be reordered with jQuery UI sortable items. When clicked the details of each item will turn up in an area to the right for editing. Depending on type the the editing will be very different so I decided to have separate DIV tags that are made visible depending on type.p  pThe previous working version loads the page items through the model. My idea was to add an observable array to the knockout viewmodel and then just load it on page load. The model is defined on the server so my intention was to not define all properties once again on the client viewmodel. Further manipulation and editing would just use the same collection and upload newchangeddeleted values to the server through AJAX calls.p  pI have read the knockout demos and searched stackoverflow for similar usecases. I think I followed the suggestions, but obviously something is missing. The model is loaded all right. The items turn up and are displayed with different colors depending on type. They are sortable and on resort the changes are sent back to server and persisted all right.p  pThe missing part is the display and editing of the currently selected item. I added another property named currentItem to the viewmodel. In the function body.onclick, .sortableItem I can verify that the currentItem is loaded and the Heading property is correct.p  pBut visibility and content of the DIV divEditType1 is not affected. Have I misunderstood the binding concept Have I misunderstood the loading from server JSON array Any help is most appreciated. p  pThis is the server page modelp  precodepublic class PresentationItemsModel      public Guid PresentationId  get set      public string DisplayName  get set      public ListltPresentationItemModelgt PresentationItems  get set   codepre  pThis is the repeated item modelp  precodepublic class PresentationItemModel      public Guid PresentationItemId  get set      public string PresentationItemType  get set      public int OrderNumber  get set      public string Heading  get set      public string Content  get set      ....  codepre  pThis is the client page irrelevant parts removedp  precodemodel MyCustomWeb.Models.PresentationItemsModel  ltheadergt     lth2gtModel.DisplayNamelth2gt ltheadergt  ltdiv stylefloat leftgt     ltfieldsetgt         ltlegendgtCurrent listltlegendgt         ltul idsortable databindforeach presentationItemsgt             ltli classsortableItem btn btnblock databindcss sortable  PresentationItemType  Itemgt                 ltdiv stylefontweight 500gt                     ltspan databindtext Headinggtltspangt                     ltspan classuiicon uiiconarrowthick2ns styledisplay inlineblock color gray float right opacity 0.5 height 14px margin 2px 4px 0 0gtltspangt                 ltdivgt             ltligt         ltulgt     ltfieldsetgt ltdivgt  ltdiv iddivEditType1 databindvisible currentItem.PresentationItemType  Type1 stylefloat left marginleft 50pxgt     ltfieldsetgt         ltlegendgtEdit Type 1ltlegendgt         ltdiv classcontrolgroupgt             ltinput typetext databindvalue currentItem.Heading placeholder  Enter Heading gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcontrolgroupgt             ltbutton idbtnSave typesubmit classbtn btnprimarygtSaveltbuttongt             ltbutton idbtnDelete typesubmit classbtn btndangergtDeleteltbuttongt         ltdivgt     ltfieldsetgt ltdivgt  ltdiv iddivEditType2 databindvisible currentItem.PresentationItemType  Type2 stylefloat left marginleft 50pxgt ltdivgt  ltdiv iddivEditType3 databindvisible currentItem.PresentationItemType  Type3 stylefloat left marginleft 50pxgt ltdivgt   section Scripts      ltscriptgt         document.readyfunction                 Enable item sorting             sortable.sortable                                      cursor move,                     placeholder sortableSeparator,                     update function                            Create array of all changed items                         var changeItems  []                         var currentOrderNumber  1                         .sortableItem.eachfunction                               var id  this.attrdataid                             var previousOrderNumber  this.attrdataorderNumber                             if currentOrderNumber  previousOrderNumber                                 changeItems.push id id, orderNumber currentOrderNumber                              currentOrderNumber  1                                                   Send ajax action                         .ajax                             type PUT,                             url apiPresentationApiChangeOrder  Model.PresentationId,                             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,                             data JSON.stringifychangeItems                                              ,                                             Enable change depending on item click              Note Must be done this way beacuse of the dynamic binding             body.onclick, .sortableItem, function                   viewModel.currentItem  ko.dataForthis                 alertviewModel.currentItem.Heading   Works fine                 alertJSON.stringifyviewModel.currentItem   Also looks good                              Knockout view model             function ViewModel                  var self  this                 self.presentationItems  ko.observableArray[]                 self.currentItem  ko.observable                           var viewModel  new ViewModel             viewModel.presentationItemsHtml.RawJson.EncodeModel.PresentationItems             ko.applyBindingsviewModel              ltscriptgt  codepre  pEdit An attempt to create a Fiddle demo can be found here  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXXNz9 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netXXNz9ap
Negative 2175 pIve been benchmarking some CUDA programs 2D and 3D lattice boltzmann solvers and have come across something unusual I would expect some random variation in the performance of the solver over time, but over a variety of different problem sizes, block sizes, OS and GPUs not to mention that the 2D and 3D codes are completely separate and not different configurations of the same program I can see a very clear sinusoidal fluctuation in kernel execution times. For the two GPUs Ive tested on K5000m and K20c the variation seems to have a frequency in the 1012Hz range. p  pIs there any known explanation for this My goto idea is thermalpower management but Ive not been able to prove it. Has anyone else experienced thisp  pFURTHER INFO AND AN EXAMPLEp  pA MSVC2010 project for a small example code can be found at a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comvieweravamppidsitesampsrcidZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxtYXJram1hd3NvbnxneDplOWMwNWNhNDA4MmMwMjg relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comvieweravamppidsitesampsrcidZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxtYXJram1hd3NvbnxneDplOWMwNWNhNDA4MmMwMjga The project requires CUDA 5.0 and a sm30 device,although there is only one file so building the project manually would be trivial. The code is fairly self explanatory, 100 iterations of a simple kernel kernels to read from several arrays and write to several arrays are performed by default are timed and their results printed to a file.  Performing a FFT of the execution times yields visible peak near 11Hz on a K5000m. I would post an image  but I dont have the reputation.p

Negative 2175 pI am trying to create a swipe event that will hide  show the navigation at the bottom of a mobileready page.

Negative 2175 pI currently have a merge sort, which was sorting a list of Nodes according to an integer within each Node called F So Node.F.p  pHowever, I have come up with a need to use the MergeSort for another list of objects  Entities. However, I want to sort this according to an integer within each Entity called AmountEaten So Entity.AmountEaten.p  pNow here lies my problem  making the MergeSort class work for all objects. I have already replaced all references to Node within the sort with object, but how do I allow a custom criteria for sorting Is there a way to provide it as a parameter.p  pIf that doesnt make sense, within the MergeSort, I compare two values E.g. Left.F lt Right.F. With a generic object, this doesnt work, because F doesnt exist. I would like to be able to compare anything within the object, inside my Sort E.g. Left.AmountEaten lt Right.AmountEaten. I cant figure out how to give this as a parameter. I immediately thought of Delegates, but Im not sure howif that is right.p  pAs the sort deals with lists and not individual objects, I cant simply give a parameter of FAmountEaten as I would like to access the variable, not the value.p  pIf you need any more detaildont understand, please ask.p  pstrongSeem to have reached some form of a conclusion, but can you help me make it workstrongp  pemMergeSort Classemp  precodestatic class MergeSort      public static IListltobjectgt SortIListltobjectgt input, Comparisonltobjectgt comparison  Comparison is a delegate that works out the difference                                                                                           between 2 values  Same signature used by ListltTgt.Sort               Listltobjectgt Result  new Listltobjectgt         Queueltobjectgt Left  new Queueltobjectgt Switched from lists to queues because removing at index 0 is more efficient         Queueltobjectgt Right  new Queueltobjectgt         Dequeue and Count have a time complexity of O1          if input.Count lt 1             return input          int midpoint  input.Count  2          for int i  0 i lt midpoint i             Left.Enqueueinput[i]         for int i  midpoint i lt input.Count i             Right.Enqueueinput[i]          Left  new QueueltobjectgtSortLeft.ToList, comparison Recursion o         Right  new QueueltobjectgtSortRight.ToList, comparison  This line and the one above split the list into smaller lists left and right          Result  MergeLeft, Right, comparison This joins the lists together          return Result           private static Listltobjectgt MergeQueueltobjectgt Left, Queueltobjectgt Right, Comparisonltobjectgt comparison              int cmp  comparisonLeft.Peek, Right.Peek         If cmp is less than 0, left is less.

Negative 2175 pWhen I use FIRSTVALUE on a data set that I construct by hand I get one result, and when I use it on a data set that results from a left join, I get a different result  even though the data sets appear to me to contain the exact same data values. Ive reproduced the issue with a simple data set below.p  pCan someone tell me if I have misunderstood somethingp  pThis SQL produces the expected result, that FIRSTVALUE is NULL and LASTVALUE is 30.p  precodeSELECT   agroup,   aval,   FIRSTVALUEaval OVER PARTITION BY agroup ORDER BY aval ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING fv,   LASTVALUEaval OVER PARTITION BY agroup ORDER BY aval ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING lv FROM    SELECT 1 agroup, 10 aval   UNION ALL SELECT 1, NULL   UNION ALL SELECT 1, 30  T codepre  pThis SQL uses a LEFT JOIN that results in the same data set as above, but FIRSTVALUE appears to ignore the NULL.p  precodeSELECT    agroup,   aval,   FIRSTVALUEaval OVER PARTITION BY agroup ORDER BY aval ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING fv,   LASTVALUEaval OVER PARTITION BY agroup ORDER BY aval ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING lv FROM    SELECT      T1.agroup,     T1.akey,     T2.aval    FROM         SELECT 1 agroup, 1 akey     UNION ALL SELECT 1, 2     UNION ALL SELECT 1, 3    T1   LEFT JOIN        SELECT 1 akey, 10 aval     UNION ALL SELECT 3,30    T2 ON T1.akey  T2.akey  T codepre  pI can also show that the left join behavior is different when using a table variable vs. a CTE.

My code is as follows.p  precode  1 include ltiostreamgt   2 includeltstdlib.hgt   3 using namespace std   4    5 bool legalintchar str   6    7 int mainint argc, char argv[]   8    9  int total  0  10  forint i  1 i lt argc i  11    12   if legalintargv[i]  true   13     14    cout ltlt Good to go ltlt endl  15     16   else  17     18    cerr ltlt Error illegal integer. ltlt endl  19    return 1  20     21    22   23    int value  atoiargv[i]  24   cout ltlt value ltlt endl  25   26   27 bool legalintchar str  28   29  whilestr  0  need to  30  if isdigitstr  do something here  31    32   return true  33    34  else  35    36   return false  37    38  codepre  pWhat i need to know is how can I index through all characters in the string and make sure they are digits with the legalint function. If someone could point me in the right direction thatd be great If anymore clarification is needed, just ask.p
Negative 2175 pI have two VSPackages. The first one provides a global service. Both VSPackages consume the service. p  pThe service is defined as explained in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb16645928vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowMSDN How To Register a Servicea. I left out the ComVisibleAttribute, because the howto says its only required if the service needs to be available in unmanaged code, which it doesnt.

This means that the package was sited. When the GetService call in Initialize is reached, VS loads my service provider, i.e., the ProvideServiceAttribute correctly marks the MessageBusProviderPackage as provider of the SMessageBus service. The provider package gets instantiated and its Initialize method gets called, wherein the service is retrieved successfully.

Negative 2175 pId like to have multiple codeActionListenercodes in my class.

Negative 2175 pWhen I send objectForKey to the dictionary returned by [NSManagedObjectModel entitiesByName], objectForKey returns the expected result if the passedin key is a literal constant such as foo.  But if I instead pass in a local variable whose value is constructed to be equal to foo, objectForKey returns nil in Mac OS X 10.9.  In Mac OS X 10.8, it returns the expected value, whether the key is a constant or not.p  pThe problem is probably due to the fact that, in 10.9, entitiesByName returns a subclass of NSDictionary called NSKnownKeysDictionary2.  In 10.8, it returns NSKnownKeysDictionary1.  My guess is that p  ul liDuring optimization, the compiler coalesces any duplicate constant strings into one.li liNSKnownKeysDictionary2 is optimized based on the assumption that keys are such constants, and thus uses pointer equality instead of isEquals.li ul  pAccording to the documentation, a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationcocoareferenceCoreDataFrameworkClassesNSManagedObjectModelClassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccinstmNSManagedObjectModelentitiesByName relnofollow[NSManagedObjectModel entitiesByName] returns an NSDictionarya, which is in turn a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationcocoareferenceFoundationClassesNSDictionaryClassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefdoccrefNSDictionary relnofollowdocumented to use isEquals to compare keysa p  pemWithin a dictionary, the keys are unique. That is, no two keys in a single dictionary are equal as determined by isEqual.emp  pSo I think this is a bug in Mac OS X 10.9.  I think that maybe someone didnt notice that [NSManagedObjectModel entitiesByName] was a public method when they optimized it to return NSKnownKeysDictionary2.  Since most developers use constant strings for entity names, this bug slipped all the way through the Developer Previews and no one noticed.p  pAm I wrong, or should I file a bugp  pThanks,p  pJerry Krinockp  hr  pCode demonstrating this from my project, sorry is below.

Practically readswrites to boolean variable are atomic, but theory doesnt guarantee that. From my point of view the code above could be safely rewritten with C11 by using stdatomicloadstore functions with acquirerelease memory ordering constraints correspondingly.li liWe dont have this problem in the described example, but if we have more then one write we may have problems with memory ordering. Volatile is not a fence, it doesnt force memory ordering, it just prevents compiler optimization.li ol  pSo why so many people use volatile bool for busy wait and is it really portablep

All of them create a new input buffer for scanning the string, and return a corresponding YYBUFFERSTATE handle which you should delete with yydeletebuffer when done with it. They also switch to the new buffer using yyswitchtobuffer, so the next call to yylex will start scanning the string. p blockquote  pThen you have codeyyscanstringcode and suchp  pUsually Flexs default settings are fine, I have one file to scan or only need the one scanner however this task is different. p  pI am trying to create a scanner able to scan multiple files and some strings.

Negative 2175 pIm creating an Android app using the YouTube Data API v3. So far so good until I realized that a great many videos do not play.p  pI get Content from holder is blocked in your country on copyright grounds....p  pI googled and it seems the way to deal with this is to use the version 3 YouTube.Search.List object and to setp  psearch.setVideoSyndicatedtruep  pUnfortunately this is far too restrictive. All Vevo videos and who knows what else disappear from the results even though those played fine.p  pI already have search.setVideoEmbeddabletrue so that is not a variable of interest in this equation.p  pNow I should add I have poured over the documentation and ended up finding thisp  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutube2.0developersguideprotocolpartialcsw1RetrievingVideosforMobilePlaybackhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutube2.0developersguideprotocolpartialcsw1RetrievingVideosforMobilePlaybackap  p... which saysp  pstrongRetrieving videos for playback on mobile devicesstrongp  pTo ensure that an API response only contains videos that are suitable for playback on a mobile device, set the fields parameter to the following value. Note that the hash character  that appears in the parameter value must be escaped 23.p  pfieldsentry[linkrela hrefhttpgdata.youtube.comschemas200723mobilehttpgdata.youtube.comschemas200723mobilea]p  pIf you are developing an application for mobile devices, you may also want to specify the mobile projection in API requests.p  p....p  pOk... so even though this is only applicable for API version 2.0 I figured, what the hey...

Note the mobile is known as projection in the documentation and would normally be api in the common endpoint.p  pNow when I say, this does work that means I get XML back that does indeed filter out the videos that were getting the blocked on copyright grounds playback error.p  pHowever a search on PNK or Rihanna or insert pop arteest du jour here yields AWFUL results.p  pMy headache worsens YouTubes official mobile app for Android does INDEED display YouTube Vevo stuff as when I do not set syndicated to true AND they do not display all the myriad videos blocked in my country on copyright grounds.p  pNow I am in the Big Apple USA so lets not take the your country stuff to imply I am in some unfortunate burg.p  pSo in a nutshell something is rotten in the YouTube Data API when attempting to create an acceptable mobile UX or I am missing something. I hope it is the latter and someone can tell me how to use YT Data API v3 to get Vevo the baby and lose the six zillion blocked in your country on copyright grounds bathwater results.p  pThis issue seems to be long standing but also a niche area and it simply makes no sense that Google would tell their API developer community to use the syndicated attribute which removes all content from their partner like Vevo who seem to want their content played on mobile..... The player API for Android does show ads for these so it is a monetized revenue stream after all.p  pAnybody here can enlighten me as to what I am missing from this equation or is this just something no one at Google is aware of or deems high enough priority to remedy I am new to version 3 of the API so maybe Im just ignorant of something key.p  pTHANKSp

Negative 2175 pThis is what I have to do Write a script in Python that is an implementation of a version of the Vigenere cipher for English text. Your script should distinguish lowercase and uppercase letters i.e., the encryption key and the plaintext are allowed to be composed of lowercase and uppercase letters but the ciphertext should be uppercase. In addition to letters, there will be four other characters in the plain text comma 26, dot 27, dash 28, underscore 29 changing the encryption function to be under mod 30. Your script should read from standard input and write to standard output. It should prompt the user for the encryption key of size k. The key is not allowed to be repeated as in the standard Vigenere cipher. Instead, we will follow a block cipherbased idea. Basically, the plaintext and ciphertext will have blocks of size k which is same as the key size. If the key length is shorter than the plaintext, the ciphertext of block size k of the previous block is concatenated to the key. Here is an example when the keyword is Carbondale with k  10p  precode Plaintext   SIUCSDepartmentisthebest  Key         CarbondaleUIHAQBBDPTUZ,MUOUCX  Ciphertext  UIHAQBBDPTUZ,MUOUCXHTODQTPYUM codepre  pSo, I want to know if anyone can help me with the part of the extra characters , .

Negative 2175 pI am currently trying to write a Java program that solves this.p  pAnother way to generalize the twothread Peterson lock is to arrange a number of 2thread Peterson locks in a binary tree. Suppose n is a power of two. Each thread is assigned a leaf lock which it shares with one other thread. Each lock treats one thread as thread 0 and the other as thread 1.p  pI feel like I have solved it, but my output is not always correct. I suspect my problem is in the for loop in my lock method that calls a verified Peterson lock Peterson lock has no errors in that it was provided to solve this problem. I basically build a balanced binary tree, declare an array of Peterson Algorithm instances, and, as each thread comes in, I have use the tree as an index and call the Peterson locks.p  precodepackage mutex  import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock  public class treelock implements Lock  int totalinstances int threadinstances  0 int N static int cnt  0 static int cnt2  0 int flag  0 Node root Peterson[] PeterInstances int[] IncomingThreadIDs  final private ThreadLocalltIntegergt THREADID2  new ThreadLocalltIntegergt     final private AtomicInteger id2  new AtomicInteger0      protected Integer initialValue         return id2.getAndIncrement         Constructor    treelock Constructor Input          n, the number of threads Descritpion    Determine number of instances fore each thread, Create IDs for each thread,                  Create Balanced Binary Tree of with keys numbered from 0 to n treelockint n      Nn     int temp  n     totalinstances  n  1     int[] IDs  new int[totalinstances]      Determine number of instances of each thread     whiletemp  1              temp 2         threadinstances           PeterInstances  new Peterson[totalinstances]     forint i  0 i lt totalinstances i              PeterInstances[i]  new Peterson          IncomingThreadIDs  new int[n]      Create IDs for each thread     forint i  0 i lt ni2              IncomingThreadIDs[i]  cnt         IncomingThreadIDs[i1]  cnt          cnt2          Create array with keys for each node in binary tree     forint i  0 i lt totalinstancesi              IDs[i]i          Create binary tree with keys from above array     BuildTree0,IDs.length1,IDs   Function    BuildTree Input       lowest index of array, high index of array, pointer to array Output      Balanced Binary Tree Description Createds a Balanced Binary Tree Credit to httplinwdav.blogspot.com201106howtobuildbalancedbinarysearch.html public Node BuildTreeint low, int high, int[] arr             iflow gt high         return null     else              int mid  low  high2         Node node  new Nodearr[mid]         ifflag  0                      root  node             flag                  node.leftChild  BuildTreelow,mid1,arr         node.rightChild  BuildTreemid1,high,arr         return node         Function     findNodeParent Input        key for a node Output       key of parent node Description  Determines the key for a parent node public int findNodeParentint key      ifroot.key  key         return  1     Node focusNode  root      whilefocusNode.leftChild.key  key ampamp focusNode.rightChild.key  key              ifkey lt focusNode.key                      focusNode  focusNode.leftChild                  else                      focusNode  focusNode.rightChild                    return focusNode.key   Function     lock Description  locks other threads public void lock      get thread ID     int cnt3  THREADID2.get  N      int[] path  new int[threadinstances]     path[0]  IncomingThreadIDs[cnt3]      create path to root node     forint k  1 k lt threadinstances k              path[k]  findNodeParentpath[k1]          attempt to lock thread up to root node     forint i  0 i lt threadinstances i                               Problem is here         PeterInstances[path[i]].lock             ThreadID  findNodeParentThreadID        Function    unlock Description  unlocks other threads public void unlock      get thread ID     int cnt3  THREADID2.get  N      create path to root node     int[] path  new int[threadinstances]     path[0]  IncomingThreadIDs[cnt3]      forint k  1 k lt threadinstances k              path[k]  findNodeParentpath[k1]           attempt to unlock thread to the node     forint i  threadinstances  1 i gt 0 i              PeterInstances[path[i]].unlock          Any class implementing Lock must provide these methods public Condition newCondition  throw new java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException  public boolean tryLocklong time,            TimeUnit unit throws InterruptedException  throw new java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException  public boolean tryLock  throw new java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException  public void lockInterruptibly throws InterruptedException  throw new java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException     class Node  int key  Node leftChild Node rightChild Node parent  Nodeint key      this.key  key    codepre

My driverpackage debug build, 64 bit has both kernelmode and usermode code.The package was successfully installed in my target machine and the module too got loaded as I can verify using the windbgcommand lm. And Im running the Windbg in Admin mode on the host and debugging the target using 1394 firewire card.p  pAfter commencing the application, when I try to debug a function in the usermode driver, I observe that the intendedfunction is not getting hit though the breakpoint is properly set and enabled. Then I set a breakpoint of a function a recurring service procedure which often gets hit when enabled in kernelcode. This time this kernel mode driver function breaksin and after sometime the aboveset usermode driver function too breaksin and I can debug the same and follow the code path. p  pAgain, when I close amp restart the application, only when the kernel mode driverfunction breakpoint is enabled and hit, the user mode driverfunction gets hit. But, if its disabled, the user mode driver function is not hit. This happens irrespective of on what functions we are setting the breakpoints on kernelmode or usermode drivers.p  pWhy this behavior, though the modules are properly loaded Do I need to configure or make sure something so that as and when I start the application, I dont need to rely on the kernelmode partp

Ive concatenated the users ID to a button name attribute. For example, nameaddfriend2, or namecancelrequest2. Before AJAX request, I split that string, and then send the button name and the ID separately. In serverside, I process the request, with the given ID and my own ID which remained in the session variable, and then return the users ID, and in AJAX callback, I concatenate it back to a new button name. Everything works fine now, but Im still confused with that session problem. p

Negative 2175 pIm new to PHP and web development, and Im trying to figure out how to design my site with as little copyandpasted code as possible.

This is a simplified version of what Im working with right now p  precodeltphp content  htmlspecialcharsGET[contenturl]gt  ltbodygt     ltdiv idmaincontainergt         ltphp require header.htmlgt          ltdiv idcontentcontainergt             ltphp include contentgt         ltdivgt          ltphp require header.htmlgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pAll of the sites content is stored in pages about.html, social.html, etc. that should be somehow loaded into the contentcontainer div of the index.php template page. This way, it should be easy to maintain and update the sites content without touching the template at all. Before this, I tried using AJAX to load in content asynchronously but I wasnt able to link directly to individual pages through that method, so using PHP GET seems like a better option. p  pI have a good idea of what I emwant to doem, but my unfamiliarity with web development and the syntax of PHP is kind of a roadblock for me right now. So, how can I use PHP GET to populate my page with content from another file strongEdit 1strong Or, am I going about this problem the wrong way, and what should I be doing insteadp  pstrongEdit 2strong For the mere sake of learning, Id kind of prefer to see how this kind of thing is done using PHP or even JS, if possible.

However sometimes I edit my script in order to be able to reproduce my results if needed I would like to have a copy of whatever version of the script was used to generate the data live right in the directory with the data. So basically I would like to have my python script copy itself to the data directory. Whats the best way to do thisp  pThanksp

Wouldnt this recreate the retain cycle that we were trying to prevent in the first placep  pLets say for example that self is 0x123 Then weakself is also pointing to 0x123. Then strongSelf would get set to 0x123 inside the block.br Wouldnt this make a retain cycleself has strong reference to block and strongSelf has a strong reference to selfp
Negative 2175 pI really want to grasp TDD approach and integrate it into my coding behaviors, but I have really hard time to understand how do people test some complicated cases. For example, consider this situation I have a game, consisting of levels. When the user passes the level, I should display a dialog, informing him of his current position amongst his friends. The dialog can show only 3 places, amongst which the current user should have the highest place and score. If the user has less than 2 friends, I must display fake friends in this dialog.p  pSo, I have a function, which receives a vector of objects, containing UIDs of users by which they are represented in some social network and their scores and places in the leaderboard for the given level. The function should be called after the game level ends and it should marshal those users in right order in the dialog view which displays the users in proper order, according to their place, scores etc. So this function looks like this in pseudocodep  precodepublic function marshallUsersusersVector.ltUsergtvoid     Add necessary fake users, if the vector length less than 3     Compute social network request for userss photos    basically it just a string with commaseparated user ids     Enquiry social network API asynchronously, calling callback    function when the request succeeds. This is singleton.   private function callbackusersArrayvoid       fill the user portraits in the dialog  codepre  pSo how can I extract what exactly should I test in the marshallUsers function Inner object state changes How can I test the function which not only relies on external global object, but also logically continues after the asynchronous call succeeds How can I avoid thatp

It describes a way to migrate a persistent store and change the journaling options... but it assumes I already have an instance of NSPersistentStore, which I dont.  I could add it via the PSC... but that would require migrating it, which defeats the whole purposeagain, because Im trying to find the version of the existing store before I migrate it.p  pOne potential complication here is that Im trying to switch from a UIManagedDocument store to a traditional CoreData stack were ditching UIManagedDocument because of a neverending string of problems, and we understand a standard CoreData stack much better.  In practice this hasnt seemed to have been a problem until now but I thought it might be worth mentioning.p  pEdit this is on an iPad 3rd generation running iOS 7.1.1.p

Negative 2175 pI have two arrays, both with rowsintAllNumsRows. The first array arrAllNums is Public Dimd as Integer and is 6 columns wide, i.e. arrAllNums1 to intAllNumsRows, 1 to 6. The second arrAllNumsDates is Public Dimd as Date and is just 1 column wide, i.e. arrAllNumsDates1 to intAllNumsRows. The dates correspond to their arrAllNums data.p  pAs you can see in the code below, the Ranges are resized to rows equaling intAllNumsRows and their respective arrays are placed into them. The first Range and its array work just fine. The proper cells on the sheet have the data 6 columns wide and the correct number of rows. All the data shows.p  pThe second Range is done exactly the same way with arrAllNumsDates, but only the first date...the date coming from arrAllNumsDates1...is placed in emall the cells of the rangeem. In other words, if arrAllNumsDates1112014, then that is the date that is placed in every cell from AA5 through to the last cell row in the Range. The same date is in every cell.p  pAs you can see, Ive used Debug.Print to verify the actual dates stored in the array. Theyre perfect. There is nothing wrong with the array. And since Range does in fact display dates in all the correct cells, it seems that the Range is resizing properly. There is a date in all the proper cells.

Negative 2175 pI have a codeView Controllercode that sets up and runs an codeAVCaptureSessioncode. After the user captures a photo, I do some codeCore Graphicscode processing on the image to get the image ready for saving and uploading to third party services.p  pBecause this codeCore Graphicscode processing takes some time, I decided to sort of trick the user when they press the button to capture a photo. p  pInstead of waiting for the codeCore Graphicscode processing to show their final photo on the screen, I just pause the codeAVCaptureSessioncode and then its codePreview Layercode just shows a freeze frame of what was on screen when the user pressed the button.p  pThis has always worked perfectly for me, but now I have a problem.p  pWhen a user wants to share the final photo to Instagram, the Instagram app is opened and the user leaves my app. Once the user is done with the Instagram app and they come back to my app, the screen is just white, and Im assuming this is because the codeAVCaptureSessioncode andor the objects that it interacts with are being destroyed.p  pThe thing is, the user can still come back and share the final photo to other services just fine, but the average user wont even try to do that because the photopaused codePreview Layercode is not on screen anymore and they will just think that it has been deleted.p  pIs there a way that I can keep these codeAVCaptureSessioncode objects from being destroyed, so that when the user comes back to my app it does not look like their photo has been erased from the screenp

Negative 2175 pI have a Mac, so I dont have access to any windows.h functions, or any other windows libraries in C. I am creating a game in C. The controls of the game are the characters w,a,s,d. Currently I have the input method as stdcin. However, the problem is after the user types each character they must hit enter every time. Furthermore, the fact the stdcin does not timeout means that the user can essentially pause the game to think about what move to make next which ruins much of the fun of this game. p  pI need a function like stdcin but with a timeout of about .25 seconds. A function that will return as soon as the user types the character without the need of the user hitting enter would also work but a function like stdcin with a timeout would be preferred. Please dont suggest windows library functions as I am again a Mac user using terminal. p  pAre there any standard c functions within the standard mac Libraries which will function equivalently to stdcin with a timeout of T that will run correctly in a Mac terminalp

Negative 2175 pI have a web application that is used in a warehouse. The browser runs in a handheld scanner connected by WiFi. The application runs ok until the user moves from one area of the warehouse to another one. The applications becomes unresponsive for a while and then it becomes responsive again.p  pMy guess is that it has something to do from changing from one access point to another.p  ul lipWhen the transition happens, you can ping from the gun to the server without problems.pli lipThe IP address remains unchanged.pli lipThe webserver access log, doesnt show any activity.pli ul  pI am not a network specialist. But my guess is that things are ok at the Internet Layer IP, but they break out at the transport layer. May be there is a conversation going on open socket between the browser and the server and the change in the access point leaves the conversation on an unstable state.p  pAny suggestions are welcomed. The server runs apache with php. The browser support HTML5 runs on a intermec scanner.p

In order to access it, I have defined a get function as followingp  precodevectorltintgt LotteryTicketgetLuckyNumbersList      return luckyNumbers  codepre  pOne of the things I am required to do is check for winning tickets. A Bronze winner is someone who managed to guess all the correct numbers, but not in the correct order. In other words, the sets have to match. In order to do that, I want to sort both tickets the winning numbers and the players numbers and then check 1 for 1.p  pI attempt to sort them by using the following functionsp  precodevoid LotteryMachinesortTicketLotteryTicketamp ticket      forint i  ticket.getLuckyNumbersList.size1 i gt 0 i          forint j  0 j lt i j              ifticket.getLuckyNumbersList[j] gt ticket.getLuckyNumbersList[j1]                 swapticket.getLuckyNumbersList[j], ticket.getLuckyNumbersList[j1]                    cout ltlt endl ltlt Sorted ticket  ltlt ticket.getTicketNumber ltlt      printTicketticket   sorting by bitwise operations void LotteryMachineswapintamp a, intamp b      a  b     b  a     a  b  codepre  pI have the codecoutcode there as a test to see if my vectors were indeed sorted. So far no luck. I am suspecting Im losing reference at some point, but Im not sure where... or I might messed something up in my syntax with all these long dotnotation returns...p  pFor additional context, the codesortTicketLotteryTicketampcode function is invoked from within the function that checks if a ticket is a bronze winner. That mentioned function receives the codeticketcode argument from a different function... i.e. a long chain of passing the argument, all with a call by reference I can paste more code if needed.p  pAny thoughts The codesortTicketcode function should sort the arrays and make it stick outside the scope of the function.p

Negative 2175 pIm currently trying to display a Neo4j database on Sigma.js using JSON plugin of Sigma.js. I give you more details I created my Neo4j database with a Groovy script that I wrote. Then I exported this database into a JSON file using Gephi. Now I can display the graph using an instance of Sigma.js in a HTML file but the problem is that nodes labels arent visible on my graph. I compared my JSON file with JSON files that come with the examples in Sigma.js folder downloaded on Github and I saw that for every nodes in my JSON file there isnt a label parameter as there is in the JSON file from the example. Instead there is an attributes parameter for every nodes. Thats why I guess Sigma.js interprets the labels as properties and doesnt display them. I want to find a solution to have this label parameter automatically, because I cant modify manually since my graph is to big. Do you have any idea how to fix this problem  Maybe it comes from the moment I create my database, nodes arent labelled properly  Thanks a lot for your helpp

Negative 2175 pI am trying to create URLs that look like codehttplocalhost8080appclientsharednamespacesandactionscodep  ul licodeappcode would be the context root.li licodeclientcode would actually be a variable, replaced by the actual client versioninterface of the application, such as john i.e. codehttplocalhost8080appjohnnamespacesandactionscode.li licodesharednamespacesandactionscode would be packagesactions accessible under one or more clients such as aboutcontact, or products73edit.li ul  pIdeally, a URL could entirely omit the client component, and so that for actions where it makes sense some sort of combined view could be displayed. For example codeappcode would display links to the client versions, whereas the clients codeappclientcode would have what that client wants on their homepage.p  pThis variable client component is what I have a question about.p  pThus far, I have been using a query string parameter to handle the client selection, rather than part of the URL path. However, this has some obvious issues for things like bookmarks, as I always have to pass the client parameter in the query string not attractive, else bookmarks will fail.p  pIs there an easy way to make this change It seems like what I want is a wildcard in the namespace, as I do with actions, but the documentation doesnt seem to support that as a possibility, nor did experimentation. I already use packages to set namespaces, interceptor stacks, and to group related actions in the struts.xml file, so it would not be trivial to change all actions to be under the  namespace package with an additional wildcard for the client.p  pAn option I was looking at was to extend the class codeDefaultActionMappercode, and override the method codeparseNameAndNamespaceString, ActionMapping, ConfigurationManagercode, removing the client component of the URI if it exists, and then passing that modified URI to the parent implementation. However this has a number of issues, such as breaking all links, form targets, and redirects. I expect fixing the linksforms would be annoying to fix, but not impossible, but Im not sure if the same would be true of redirects.p  pI am using 2.3.16.3.p  hr  pstruts.xmlp  precodeltstrutsgt     ltconstant namestruts.enable.SlashesInActionNames valuetrue gt     ltconstant namestruts.mapper.alwaysSelectFullNamespace valuefalse gt     ltconstant namestruts.patternMatcher valuenamedVariablegt      ltconstant namestruts.action.extension value gt      ltpackage         namepocdefault         extendsstrutsdefault         strictmethodinvocationtruegt         ltdefaultinterceptorref namedefaultStack gt         ltdefaultactionref namehttp404 gt         ltaction             namehttp404             classpoc.DefaultActiongt             ltresult namesuccessgtWEBINFhttp404.jspltresultgt         ltactiongt     ltpackagegt  ltpackage     nameroot     namespace     extendspocdefault     strictmethodinvocationtruegt     ltaction         name         classpoc.DefaultActiongt         ltresult namesuccessgtWEBINFhome.jspltresultgt     ltactiongt     ltaction         nameclients         classpoc.DefaultActiongt         ltresult namesuccessgtWEBINFclientselect.jspltresultgt     ltactiongt ltpackagegt ltstrutsgt codepre  pUsing the struts.xml above, codehttplocalhost8080poccode goes to the home page, and codehttplocalhost8080pocclientscode goes to the client selection page.p  pI then replace the package root with the following added named wildcard to namespacep  precodeltpackage     nameroot     namespaceuriClientString     extendspocdefault     strictmethodinvocationtruegt     ltaction         name         classpoc.DefaultActiongt         ltresult namesuccessgtWEBINFhome.jspltresultgt     ltactiongt     ltaction         nameclients         classpoc.DefaultActiongt         ltresult namesuccessgtWEBINFclientselect.jspltresultgt     ltactiongt ltpackagegt codepre  pNow, neither action is mapped by the URLs codehttplocalhost8080pocjohncode and codehttplocalhost8080pocjohnclientscode.p

Negative 2175 pI am following the instructions on how to create a RESTful service with Yii2 but the behavior method causes the error p  pcodeResponse content must not be an array.codep  pIf I remove the behavior method then I receive the JSON response that I expect. I tried removing the behavior method after reading another post.p  pHowever I am a little unfamiliar with behaviors. Can we not use behaviors with Yii2 with REST or is this a bug I would be very appreciate if someone could shed some light on this.p  pa hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comdoc2.0guiderestquickstart.html relnofollowhttpwww.yiiframework.comdoc2.0guiderestquickstart.htmla a hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comforumindex.phptopic60432restapifailingwithbehaviours relnofollowhttpwww.yiiframework.comforumindex.phptopic60432restapifailingwithbehavioursa p
Negative 2175 pThe challenge here is about how to keep a subset of data residing in an Sql Sever 2008 R2 in sync with an ES cluster, with minimal effort and maintainance. I am aware of both changetracking in Sql Server and JDBC River. But both solution will rely on there beeing an Index Manager to extract and transpose the data. So how do you guys do it Are there any ways of keeping the two in sync using frameworks or any standard applications It would be preferable if there was a solution was based on .NET, but this is not an must have.p  pEdit This is to be implemented into a system where its not feasible to get hold of the events i would like to manage the index. In other words, no SOA or pubsub is available. And implementing this is slightly out of scope.p
Negative 2175 pI am using a return url from PayPal to trigger an email notification that an order has been recieved.

All other view angles of the scene remain unchanged. Something else worth noting is that all models stop at 14th of the way to the top. No amount of effort will bring them above the line, their lines always end right there. And it renders the line there, even though youd expect the line to pass beyond the limit and stop rendering.p  pAlso a final note, codeOrtho.inverted  screencoordofmousecode returns the correct Xaxis coordinate, but a horribly misplaced Yaxis coordinate. This same method works perfectly for the topdown view.p

Negative 2175 pI have setup a source and symbol servers together with TFS.

I know that TFS doesnt know how my project is organized etc but the debugging symbols have information about all source files that were used to build this solution. p  pIs there any way I will be able to setup a breakpoint on some other file than the one where the exception occurred Also, I would like to be able to go to definition or peek at some methods which are not defined in the source file that opened together with the exception.p

Negative 2175 pI recently created a project structure in SVN. Checked my project into the app folder, then made a number of edits. I was editing a version of the project that was not checked out however my original project that I copypasted into the new SVN repo. I guess I just figured I could point it at the repo later and do an update and it would work. Another developer pulled the project, made some changes, and checked them in. In attempt to get my local project in sync I pulled a new repoproject to my local with the SVN HEAD version, deleted all the files in the repo in which I had personally modified on my local, and replaced them with my edited files. I was hoping that if I just did an update from that point, SVN would attempt to merge my local changes with the HEAD in SVN.p  pWhen I update, nothing happens. p  pThe files in my checked out project are showing red check marks, so SVN is aware that they are out of sync...p  pI tried to do Update to Revision with fully recursive on the root folder.

Negative 2175 pI have become stuck on a problem with a class that I am writing where I need to be able to reinitialize the parents of that class after having created an instance of the class. The problem is that the parent class has a read and a write mode that is determined by passing a string to the eminitem function. I want to be able to switch between these modes without destroying the object and reinitialising. Here is an example of my problemp  precodefrom parent import Parent  class ChildParent     def initmodew         super.initmodemode      def switchmode          need to change the mode called in the super function here somehow codepre  pThe idea is to extend a class that I have imported from a module to offer extended functionality. The problem is I still need to be able to access the original class methods from the new extended object. This has all worked smoothly so far with me simply adding and overwriting methods as needed. As far as I can see the alternative is to use composition rather than inheritance so that the object I want to extend is created as a member of the new class. The problem with this is this requires me to make methods for accessing each of the objects methods ie. lots of this sort of thingp  precodedef readframesself     return self.memberObject.readframes def seekself     return self.memberObject.seek codepre  pwhich doesnt seem all that fantastic and comes with the problem that if any new methods are added to the base class in the future I have to create new methods manually in order to access them, but is perhaps the only optionp  pThanks in advance for any helpp

DESCRIPTIONp blockquote  pAs you will see, I used the    strongstrong     sign to target specific children. When you hover over the  second line in menu, It works as it should. Then you click on something and second line of insidemenu opens, as it should. But, now if you hover there, you will notice that Both the first AND the second line of codeltligtcode children blinks, That is not set there. AND if you notice, In the second  insidemenu, If you hover only over the   codeltulgtcode box and not over the codeltligtcode box, The first line of menu still gets affected. There is nothing about hovering codeltulgtcode or making a codecursorpointercode for   codeltulgtcodes  at all. It gets even weirder, When you notice that this multiconnection doesnt work on all the properties. The fonts are separated if you change them, same is the case with background or border. But setting a codecursorcode and codehovercode in the first line of codeltligtcode   affects suddenly also the second line of codeltligtcode. The whole problem is in css, maybe in htmlnot probable, but not in JavaScriptdefinitely not, although of course, I am still just a studentp

The UX Im imagining involves looking at the rendered PDF and clicking the images you want to swap out. p  pstrongPotential Solutionsstrong I thought the easiest way to do this would be to render the initial image as a PDF where each replaceable image or text box would be a hyperlink.

Negative 2175 pI am generating a 2D array of random integers using numpyp  precodeimport numpy arr  numpy.random.randint16, size  4, 4 codepre  pThis is just an example. The array I am generating is actually enormous and of variable size. Since the numbers are always going to be from 0 to 16, I would like to save some space and have the array be of type codeuint8code.

Negative 2175 pIm using Lua for scripts in my C game.  I want to be able to attach scripts to entities, and based on which functions are defined in the script, register for callbacks which will run the script functions at the appropriate time.p  pI believe that I can encapsulate different scripts from each other, by making the script into a table.  Basically, code... lua source code ...code would become codeScriptName   ... lua source code ... code.  Then instead of calling codefunccode, Id call codeScriptName.funccode, and thus two scripts defining the same function aka registering for the same event wouldnt trample over each other.p  pMy problem now is in encapsulating different entities sharing the same script.  Obviously I dont want them to be sharing variables, but with what Im doing now, any variable defined by a script would be shared by every instance of that script, which is just really bad.  I could maybe try something similar to my above solution on the source level, by wrapping every script with codeEntityID.ScriptName   ... code before compiling it.  Something tells me theres a better way, though, I just dont know it.p  pAnother factor is that scripts need to be able to reference entities and scriptscomponents relative to a specific entity.  If I use the above method the best solution to this would be passing entity IDs around as strings which could reference the table specific to that entity, I think  At this point I really have no idea what Im doing.p
