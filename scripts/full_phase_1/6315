It appears that both the JTable instance and the TableColumnModel instance have the list of data columns, i.e., all columns regardless of visibility.  How can I get a list of only columns that are visible, or test whether a given column is visiblep  pIve searched for this, but get longs lists of articles on how to hide the columns, and no explanation of where the visibleinvisible information is kept.  I thought, since I asked the JTable to hide the column, that somewhere in there it would know which columns were hidden and I could get that info.p

Positive 6315 pcurrently I am working on a project where I need to store data from a JTable to be precise from the TableModel into a H2 database.

Positive 6315 pWe are using a JTable in a very old huge application to display some information. Till now we were working on Jre 1.7.017 or 1.7.051. Recently we tried to test our application with an upgraded JRE to 1.7.075. We noticed that when the JTable is displayed only one row appears for the first time. However during debug we see data for all rows getting added to table. I tried refresh, revalidate, repaint, fireTableDataChanged etc but still only for the first time only first row appears. If we hide and show the table again all the rows start appearing. Also tested on JREs 1.7.080, 1.8.031, 1.8.045 and 1.8.051 and the issue is reproducible. Any hint would be helpful.p  pNote  The application was developed on very old java version and has been using old style swing dialogsp  pThank You In Advancep

Positive 6315 pI have a small old application designed for one user. Now software should be changed for multi users. Software is realy simple shows just a one JTable,  but data are imported to this table only ones  when windows is opened. And the issue is that  when one user change some data different user  that works in the same time do not see this changes because will appears when window will be opened again. And now is me question is in hibernate something like data change litener, that tell to the application tat database  data has been changed and you have to update the JTable. I was thinking about PreUpdate, but I do not know that is the good idea.p

When I click on the value, however, the dropdown value for each column is the string you get when you execute codetableColumn.toStringcode.p  pMy code that builds the cell editor dropdown puts codeTableColumncode values in the codeJComboBoxltTableColumngtcode, as I thought it would have to how can I get the editor to use the header value from the tableColumn instead of using its toString, or whatever its doingp  pOne more thing in the real app, the columns in the 1st codeJTablecode are dynamic I cannot simply list the columns in the code.  I derive the number of columns and their headers from the data.  Please dont just give me examples that assume that the columns to be edited are known ahead of time.  If someone can explain how it works instead of just giving examples, thatd be great, but if we have to communicate entirely by examples, please include the dynamic nature of the tables.p

Positive 6315 pI have wrote a code for Setting a JTable to a Panel with layout null. I tried to change its width and height and tried to set a scrollpane horizontally but there is no changep
Positive 6315 pI have a codeJTablecode for which the renderer returns a codeJPanelcode composed of multiple codeJLabelcode instances. One of those codeJLabelcodes can contain HTML used among other things to split the output over multiple lines using codeltbrgtcode tags.p  pTo show the multiple lines in the table, the renderer calls in the codegetTableCellRendererComponentcode method p  precodetable.setRowHeightrow, componentToReturn.getPreferredSize.height codepre  pto dynamically update the row height, based on the contents. This only works correctly if codecomponentToReturncode indicates a correct preferred size.p  pIt looks however that the codegetPreferredSizecode returns bogus values. The preferred height of the returned component is smaller than the sum of the heights of the labels inside the component.p  pHere is a little program illustrating this behaviour without using a codeJTablecodep  precodeimport java.awt. import javax.swing.  public class SwingLabelTest    public static void mainString[] args      EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable        Override       public void run          LabelPanel renderer  new LabelPanel         Component component  renderer.getComponentfalse         asking for a bigger component will not         update the preferred size of the returned component         component  renderer.getComponenttrue                   private static class LabelPanel      private final JPanel compositePanel     private final JLabel titleLabel  new JLabel     private final JLabel propertyLabel  new JLabel      public LabelPanel        JPanel labelPanel  new JPanel       labelPanel.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutlabelPanel, BoxLayout.PAGEAXIS        labelPanel.addtitleLabel       labelPanel.addpropertyLabel        compositePanel  new JPanelnew BorderLayout       normally it contains more components,       but that is not needed to illustrate the problem       compositePanel.addlabelPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER           public Component getComponent boolean aMultiLineProperty         titleLabel.setTextTitle       if  aMultiLineProperty          propertyLabel.setTextlthtmlgtFirst lineltbrgtProperty valuelthtmlgt        else          propertyLabel.setTextProperty value               int titleLabelHeight  titleLabel.getPreferredSize.height       int propertyLabelHeight  propertyLabel.getPreferredSize.height       int compositePanelHeight  compositePanel.getPreferredSize.height       if  compositePanelHeight lt titleLabelHeight  propertyLabelHeight         throw new RuntimeExceptionPreferred size of the component returned                                      by the renderer is incorrect               return compositePanel          codepre  pAs I am aware that the previous example is a bit farfetched, here an example which includes a codeJTablecodep  precodeimport java.awt. import javax.swing. import javax.swing.table.  public class SwingTableTest     public static void mainString[] args      EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable        Override       public void run          DefaultTableModel tableModel  new DefaultTableModel0, 1         JTable table  new JTabletableModel         table.setDefaultRendererObject.class, new DataResultRenderer         tableModel.addRownew Object[]new Object         tableModel.addRownew Object[]new Object         tableModel.addRownew Object[]new Object          JFrame testFrame  new JFrameTestFrame         testFrame.getContentPane.addnew JScrollPanetable         testFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationWindowConstants.EXITONCLOSE         testFrame.setSizenew Dimension300, testFrame.getPreferredSize.height         testFrame.setVisibletrue                   private static class DataResultRenderer implements TableCellRenderer      private final JPanel compositePanel     private final JLabel titleLabel  new JLabel     private final JLabel propertyLabel  new JLabel      public DataResultRenderer         JPanel labelPanel  new JPanel       labelPanel.setOpaquefalse       labelPanel.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutlabelPanel, BoxLayout.PAGEAXIS        labelPanel.addtitleLabel       labelPanel.addpropertyLabel        compositePanel  new JPanelnew BorderLayout       normally it contains more components,       but that is not needed to illustrate the problem       compositePanel.addlabelPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER           Override     public Component getTableCellRendererComponent         JTable table, Object value, boolean isSelected,          boolean hasFocus, int row, int column        titleLabel.setTextTitle        if  row  2          propertyLabel.setTextlthtmlgtSingle property valuelthtmlgt        else          String text  lthtmlgt         text  First propertyltbrgt         text  Second propertyltbrgt         text  Third propertyvalue         text  lthtmlgt         propertyLabel.setTexttext               int titleLabelHeight  titleLabel.getPreferredSize.height       int propertyLabelHeight  propertyLabel.getPreferredSize.height       int compositePanelHeight  compositePanel.getPreferredSize.height       if  compositePanelHeight lt titleLabelHeight  propertyLabelHeight         throw new RuntimeExceptionPreferred size of the component returned                                      by the renderer is incorrect              table.setRowHeightrow, compositePanel.getPreferredSize.height       return compositePanel           codepre  pI am looking for a way to update the row height of the table to ensure that the multiline content is completely visible, without knowing up front how many lines each row will contain.p  pSo either I need a solution to retrieve the correct preferred size, or my approach is completely wrong and then I need a better one.p  pNote that the above examples are simplified.

Positive 6315 pI have a jFrame with many elements, including a jTable in a JScrollPane. The table responds ok to the keyboard when its focused, but I would like it to react the same way to UP, DOWN etc. even when its NOT focused, i.e. when some other element in the frame has focus.p  pI manage to catch the keyboard event from whatever element is focused, all I need now is to pass that event to the table. I thought that with evt being the KeyReleased event, doingp  pTheTable.dispatchEventevtp  por perhapsp  pTheScrollPane.dispatchEventevtp  pwould do the job, but neither works the table doesnt react in any way.

I only need to sort the first column in numerical order as the rest are strings.

Negative 6315 pI have created the necessary manifests for my COM server DLL and a client application to work registrationfree in Windows XP.  Ive tested all kinds of combinations with and without a registration and in all cases the client application sees the sidebyside version of the library if the manifests are present, and the registered one if not or a COM error if there is no registration at all.  Ive tested on my Windows XP development machine, and given the files DLL, client EXE and one manifest for each to coworkers, whove also run everything successfully on their own Windows XP machines.  The manifests are external XML files, not embedded resources.  So far, so good.  p  pHowever, when I copy the files to a Windows Server 2003 machine, it doesnt work.  I get a silent failure, but an application error in the Application Event Log see below.  If I unregister the DLL and remove the manifests, I get a similar error silent at the command prompt, but an application error in the event log.  Obviously there is some problem finding the registration.  I have reproduced this on every Windows Server 2003 machine I can access at our company.  According to the Microsoft documentation on sidebysideregistrationfree COM, its supposed to work on Windows XP and later, and Windows Server 2003 and later.p  pTo be clear, the same client runs perfectly on those same Windows Server 2003 machines against a emregisteredem emi.e.,em using regsvr32 version of the same COM DLL, under the same login credentials Im trying to use for registrationfree COM.  In other words, there are no intrinsic issues masquerading as registrationfree COM problems  this client and server operate fine when the server is registered globally in the registry.p  pAnybody have any ideas of how to investigate further  Im not an expert on Windows Server, but is there perhaps some policy setting that would need to be changed to enable this support  If I can locate the necessary change, our tech supportinfrastructure people will probably have no probably doing it, but I cant rely on them to research the issue too as they are swamped.p  pIn case it matters I dont think it should, but you never know the DLL is written in Delphi 2007, while the client is written in Visual C.p  pre Event Type Information Event Source   Application Error Event Category 100 Event ID   1004 Date   522009 Time   80745 AM User   NA Computer   server name Description Reporting queued error faulting application program name.exe, version 0.0.0.0, faulting module program name.exe, version 0.0.0.0, fault address 0x0002ac9e.

Negative 6315 pHello I am having some trouble with a clients website. He uses wimpy player to load a playlist of his own hosted music. Ive set up a test to demonstrate the behavior a hrefhttpmarkmaxwellmusic.comwimpytestplayer.html relnofollow titlehereherea . If you visit the site in firefox, everything works. If you visit in IE it doesnt. Further investigation shows that it can read the playlist, and makes a valid request for an mp3, but when it comes from the swf loaded in IE7, the server returns a 404. If the request is made by the swf loaded in FF, the file is returned appropriately. Furthermore, entering a url to one of the mp3s in IE7 manually allows me to download it. The only difference I could see is in IE7 the swf includes a referrer itself. I am using the proxy in burp suite to capture the requests and responses in IE7 and firebug to do the same in FF. Any insight Is there a better place to ask this type of question p

I want users to be able to click and drag this Renderer, but also just click the button.p  pRight now its working with the Renderer listening on MouseMove to initiate drag and drop, and the button listening on click.p  pHowever this is very screwy. If somebody is dragging a scroll bar and comes anywhere near that renderer, MouseMove gets fired on the renderer and initiates dragging. or if somebody is resizing a HDividedBox, basically if someone initiated a click anywhere in the app and rolls over this renderer, we get unwanted dragging. p  pThe alternative is listening on MouseDown instead of MouseMove, which fixes the previous issue, however the nested button loses its click. I can click on the button, but the renderer just thinks its time to Drag.p  pIs there anyway around thisp

Negative 6315 p.Net provides some wonderful mechanisms for defining a remote service and then automagically creating a client to connect to it, hiding away much of the nasty wiring and fuss. But is there a similar route for going the other wayp  pMy most recent task at work is to create a series of services that will communicate with one another for things like authentication and search queries. One requirement is the ability for our core service to call out to other service nodes, which may or may not be created in house but all need to implement a common interface. I can build a reference implementation of this service, create the WSDL from that, and automatically generate the client side without issue. It seems that the only way to define the service, however, is to basically point someone at the WSDL I create and say Implement something that looks like that. Seeing as how WSDLs are rarely designed to be read by human beings, this route seems less than attractive.p  pSo is there a way that Im not aware of to generate a service interface from a WSDL or similar descriptor Primarily looking at .NET 3.5 here, using C and WCF. Thanksp

Negative 6315 pIm writing an NSString category that requires an NSNumberFormatter. Im stuck between initing and releasing one every time my category is used to print a string in a certain way or initing the formatter in my app and passing it through. The NSNumberFormatter has a couple of config calls run on it first to make it work just right and repeating that in various places in my app just seems wrong. And though I could create one formatter in the main app delegate and let anyone grab it when using one of my category additions, I think thats more of a hack than an elegant solution. So, does creating and destroying an NSNumberFormatter in an NSString Categorys convenience method sound good enoughp  pCheers,    Craigp

Negative 6315 pThis car dealer company has many branch offices. In each of these branch offices, some sales people are working whose job is selling cars to customers. You need to define your branch offices in your diagram. And also, you need to define sales people who are working in these branch offices.

Each vehicle must be associated with a manufacturer. And you should also store features about vehicles such as production year, gearbox, fuel type, weight etc Do not forget that possible car features can differ for each car, so storing them in a single entity will cause null value problem. Your design must eliminate this null value problem.  And lastly, you should define an inventory for available cars for each branch of the company. This inventory will keep track of which cars are available for selling from which branches.p

Negative 6315 pI just tracked down a crash I was having in my iOS app and it is related to willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation being called before viewWillAppear.p  pI have an app with two views. Basically, when view1 disappears, I release some arrays, assuming they will be reinitialized when it reappears in viewWillAppear.p  pHowever, if I change orientation in view2 then switch back to view1, this causes willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation to happen before view1 has calledviewWillAppear and reinitialized everything and this causes a crash.p  pIs there any way to delay willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation until after the view has appeared and everything has been reinitialized p  pIf not, the only solutions I can see are either not using willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation which results in an ugly looking orientation change or not releasing my data when I switch from view1 to view2 which results in more memory being used than necessary.p  pDoes anybody have any thoughts on what I should dop

Negative 6315 pIve written a PHP script that makes a request to a search engine, accesses the served results, extracts some details from the results and then prints them in a more useful form.p  pIt all works well, but something Ive discovered by accident is that calling echo or print while waiting for data to be streamed in can result in the output being streamed as well. Specifically, there are multiple pages of results, so I access the first page, read in and reprint the content, then move on to the next page, and while waiting for that next page to load, the previous pages content becomes visible in the browser.p  pWhat I dont understand is why this happens so inconsistently. Sometimes exactly one page will be printed before moving onto the next page, sometimes less and sometimes more. Then when I do basically the same thing afterwards read in the page each result points to, the output is barely streamed at all, being redrawn every minute or so.p  pIm using codefilegetcontentsurlcode to retrieve the content, and calling a function with an codeechocode in it to print what has been loaded so far. Is this streaming print behaviour a feature of the browser and independent of what I write in PHP If not, how can it be controlled betterp

Negative 6315 pIm working on an application system , where I also need to make a server application. Im working in C .NET 4.0. The server will mainly collect data from different POS applications  clients which should be around 50100, but the server should be capable of handling also around 200300 clients. From a single client a server will probably receive around 1KB about 100x times a day. The server mainly needs to accept the data, decrypt it and store it to disk. It should also check for changes in specific directory in order to send new configurations to clients, which shouldnt be very often.p  pIm quite new to C and server programming so please bear with me. I thought about using threadpooling and async methods there is a nice example using that in a book C in a nutshell. But I spend quite some time looking for best solution and I found this. But multithreading brings more problems than benefits in my case. Thus I thought about even driven server. A single process, handle every event accepted connection, data available to read, can write to client, ... on a callback. from  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3981566whatiseventdrivenwebserver39824403982440what is event driven web servera. I find that the best solution to my problem.p  pBut I have no idea on how to code it, I couldnt find any examples about event driven servers. As far as I understand it I should make one thread  1 for GUI, then create a TCP listener and then somehow create events so that when TCP listener could accept a client the event would fire and wake up the server, also when data to read from clients would be available it would wake up the server. p  pPlease help me out to code this, Im totally lost. I know how I could do this usingp  precodewhiletrue     check if client wants to connect         accept client and add it to client list    iterate through client list and check if anyone is sending data ...         accept data and store it    ...    codepre  pBut that is not event driven and is wasting CPU. Server will not be very active, so Id like to make it as efficient as possible.p  pSome examples would really help.p  pThank you for your time and answers.p  pp.s.

Negative 6315 pI have an IEnumerable full of objects that we are using to represent user actions. This is for the ultimate goal of displaying a list of the most recent actions taken in the system. This list can get rather long, and the users have requested a 24 hour period for the list. I want to perform some squashing on this list somewhat like what Facebook does for likes and comments. For example instead of listing all 37 updates a specific user performed I can list that user x updated 37 y.p  pThese objects have the username and the datetime for the action taken as an attribute, so that information is easy enough to select. I need some help with the best way to programmatically determine what should be squashed. Ideally I am thinking for example if 1000 people are updated in our system in less than 10 minutes by the same user then its an import and not a manual edit, and I will remove those from the list of actions and replace it with so and so ran an importp  pHow would I query an IEnumerable for the objects with the same username and within a specific date rangep  pEdit The only thing I am able to initially think of is iterating over the Enumerable for each possible user and for each possible 10 minute time period. That just sounds horribly inefficient though, and Im clearly just ignorant of the options available.p

Negative 6315 pIm having some issues using adobe air in conjunction with backbone. The problem is that in the beginning of my program, I specify a url for my Backbone.Controller which uses that to set the url attribute of my Collection. And when the program starts, Backbone uses that url, to get a response and calls the parse function in my collection, where I use that response and construct appropriate model from. The problem is that at the beginning, if I specify a relative path to the .xml file, it works, but if I specify a full path, it doesnt work, meaning that the response argument in the parse function for the collection is null. Here is some codep  precodeworks document.readyfunction    window.myApp  MyApp url  datafile.xml    .. var MyApp  Backbone.Controller.extends   setup routes   initialize functionopt    this.tree  new MyTree    this.tree.url  opt.url    ... var MyTree  Backbone.Collection.extends  model myTreeModel,  parse functionresponse  do stuff with response    codepre  pThe above works if I use relative path, but If I use full path like thisp  precodewindow.myApp  MyApp url  fileCUsersuserNameMyProjectdatafile.xml   codepre  pthe response sent to parse is undefined.

Negative 6315 pI have a scenario where I am trying to automate a data entryretrieval intofrom a form. The form consists of buttons which support the general addeditdelete operations on data. Well, now the problem I have is that depending upon what entries the user enters e.g. duplicate entries, incorrect passwordlogin id, a popup is triggered. I need to obtain the text appearing in the popup and then dismiss it.p  pI used the following links on how to handle them p  ol lia hrefhttpwiki.openqa.orgdisplayWTRJavaScriptPopUps relnofollowJavascript popup handlinga li lipa hrefhttpwiki.openqa.orgdisplayWTRPopUps relnofollowDiscussion on Popup Handling in     Watira.p  pI saw a lot of solutions for the JavaScript popups either using AutoIt or without using it.pli ol  pFrom what I understand,  a Solution 2 on the Wiki essentially starts off a Process and polls for whether a popup appears every 1 second.  b Solutions 3,4,5 write a handler to dismiss the popups but they know in advance when the popup is going to appear. c I am trying to make sense of Solution 7 posted by Tony, but any pointers on that would be appreciated.p  pIn the scenario which I described, where popups could be generated dynamically by the click of a button, solution 2 seems the right option, but polling for appearing of a popup seems like an overkill. I know Ruby does not provide any native support for Event handling like C or the Listeners model in Java, but I was wondering whether it would be possible to trigger off the popup handling mechanism by means of an event driven approach.p  pThanks in advance for all the help you guys will provide. I really appreciate it. Also, hopefully I have been clear and descriptive as far as I can with the problemp

Negative 6315 pProblem Need the Length of the LCS between two strings. The size of the strings is at most 100 characters. The alphabet is the usual DNA one, 4 characters ACGT. The dynamic approach is not quick enough.p  pMy problem is that I am dealing with lots and lots of pairs of the rank of hundreds of million as far as I can see. I believe I have decreased the calling of the LCSlength function to the minimum possible so the only other way to make my program run faster is to have a more efficient LCSLength function. p  pI have started off by implementing in the usual dynamic programming approach.

I am inclined to think that maybe the OND algorithm counts substitutions as well, but I am not sure about this.p  pAny approach that is implementable I dont have immense programming skills, is welcome. If someone would know how to take advantage of the small alphabet for example.p  pEDIT I think it would be useful to say on top of everything else, that I use the LCS function between ANY two strings at ANY time. So it is not only string say s1, compared with  few million others. It might be s200 with s1000, then s0 with s10000, and then 250 with s100000. Not likely to be able to track most used strings either. I require that the LCS length is NOT an approximation, since I am implementing an approximation algorithm and I dont want to add extra error.p  pEDIT Just ran callgrind. For an input of 10000 strings I seem to call the lcs function about 50,000,000 times, for different pairs of strings. 10000 strings is the lowest I want to run and the max is 1 million if that is feasible. p

Negative 6315 pI have several apps on a single domain that share the formsauthentication ticket for single singon. We also have javascript on each page that will warn the user 2 minutes prior to his session expiration and allow him to logout or extend his session. When the countdown reaches 0, they are automatically logged off. This all works great. However, it fails miserably when a user opens multiple browser windows or tabs to work on the various apps. If window A times out while the user is working in window B, they are signed out of B on the next request.p  pI have a solution, but I cant seem to implement it. Basically, when the page is rendered, I write out the ticks of the ticket issue date. Then, when autologging out, I want to ajax call a handler to see if those ticks match the current formsauthentication ticket ticks. If they dont match, then I know another app has been refreshing the ticket and I wont log them out. The problem is that I cant create a generic handler that doesnt update the ticket because we use slidingexpiration  true.p  precodefunction CompareTicketticks      .getJSONhttplocalhostMyAppCompareTicket.ashxt  ticks, function data          if data  0             SessionEnd         else             SessionExtend       codepre  pIn the below handler code, data is returned as 0 if the value Im sending in the querystring matches the ticks of the current ticket.

Negative 6315 pThis is gonna be a big mess to explain, but if anyone has any pointer, Please sharep  pFrom an applet Im calling a 3rd parity lib which uses JNI do fetch some info in an OS specific manner. I dont know what it calls since I dont have the code and support isnt very responsive. The thing is, all works well on windows not just my machine but on Mac OS one of the libs methods throws a lib specific exception a code and a Cannot complete message. It seems to be a security related issue since the method works when I call it from within init.p  pThe jar with my applet is selfsigned, the library has 4 more jars that are signed by the vendor. The libs method is called from within an AccessController.doPrivileged block as an applet method that is called from JavaScript  and this all works, but on windows only.p  pOn Mac this call from JavaScript to the applet method that calls the libs method gets the exception.p  pHere is what I triedp  pI moved the libs method call in init just for the test and it works ok, only strongwithoutstrong an AccessController.doPrivileged block. I tried starting a Thread in init in start as well  using a timer to have the Thread calls the libs method every 10sec works fine and I can get the updated reply troughs a String buffer  this isnt a preferred  solution.  but if I use a flag in the thread so that the applet method can return the result it throws the same exception.p  pHere is the code in my applets methodp  precodecheckRunner.refreshWindowsList  true while checkRunner.refreshWindowsList      try                     Thread.sleep300      catch Exception ex          System.out.printlnIgnoring exception   ex.getMessage       return checkRunner.windowsTitles codepre  pand in the Threads run methodp  precodetry      while true          if refreshWindowsList              windowsTitles  getWindowsTitlesPrivileged             windowsTitles  getWindowsTitles             refreshWindowsList  false                  Thread.sleep300       catch Exception ex      System.out.printlnIgnoring exception   ex.getMessage  codepre  pI dont understand how just passing a flag can cause the different results.p  pFurthermore, it seems that when the applet is created from JavaScript code all of it is sandboxed and the libs method throws the exception even from init ... again only on Mac OS.p  pIf anyone made it this far  Thank You  p

Negative 6315 pI am struggling with some strange variable behavior in a recursive instance method. Running Ruby 1.8.7. Im doing this as a learning exercise and have hit a bit of a wall.

Negative 6315 pI am working on an educational tool.  I want to retrieve a value from one of a group of arrays based on a parameter passed to a function.

For the above case instead of my radiobuttons being labeled Continuous, Emarginate, Forked and so on, they are labeled c, a, u, d and so on.

It is simply selecting letters from the parameter word passed tot he function according to the index.p  pAny help would be appreciated.  Im a relative novice at Javascript.

Negative 6315 pI am developing an extension to an existing app which uses sqlalchemy 0.6.p  pThe app has sqlalchemy tables created the nondeclarative way. I am trying to create in my extension a new table with a foreign key column pointing at the primary key of the main table in the application database and I am creating it declaratively.p  pThis all works fine, with the table created once the extension is loaded, and with no complaints at all.  My table prints out and demonstrates that new rows have been added ok. What I want and think is possible but dont know as I have never used sql or any other database is for the corresponding row in my table to be deleted when the row in the apps main table with the corresponding foreign key is deleted.p  pSo far, and with many permutations having been tried, nothing has worked. I thought that with a backref set and with a relation defined with delete being cascaded, there shouldnt be a problem.  Because the new table is defined in an extension which should just plugin, I dont want to edit the code in the main app at all, at least that is my goal.  One of the problems that I have, though, is that the main app table that I want to reference, has no member variables defined in its class, does not declare its primary key in its mapper and only has the primary key declared in the table.  This makes it difficult to create a relationship clause, the first argument of which must be to a class or mapper in this case neither of which have the primary key declared. Is there any way of achieving thisp  pps  here is some of the code that I am using.  LocalFile is the declarative class.

The second product might only have tags 1 amp 4. And so on. Im almost certain that this will have to use codesortcode versus codeordercode, but was wondering if anyone has found a more efficient way of doing this. p

Negative 6315 pThis is a difficult situation to explain, so bear with me. I have a Mercurial repository with 2 main branches, emdefaultem and emdevem.p  pWork is usually done in a named branch off of emdevem a feature branch. There may be many feature branches at any one time. Once work is completed in that branch, it is merged back into emdevem.p  pWhen the time comes to prepare a release, another named branch is created off of emdevem a release branch. Sometimes it is necessary to exclude entire features from a release. If that is the case, the merge changeset from where the feature branch was merged into emdevem is backed out of the new release branch.p  pOnce a release branch is ready to be released, it is merged into emdefaultem so emdefaultem always represents the state of the code in production. Work continues as normal on the emdevem branch and feature branches.p  pThe problem occurs when the time comes to do another release, including the feature that was backed out in the previous release. A new release branch is created as normal off of emdevem. This new release branch now contains the feature that was backed out of the previous release branch since the backout was performed on the release branch, and the merge changeset remains on the emdevem branch.p  pThis time, when the release branch is ready for release and is merged into emdefaultem, any changes that were backed out as a result of the merge backout in the previous release branch are not merged into emdefaultem. Why is this the case Since the new release branch contains all of the feature branch changesets nothing has been backed out, why does the emdefaultem branch not receive all of these changesets toop  pIf all of the above is difficult to follow, heres a screenshot from TortoiseHg that shows the basic problem. branch1 and branch2 are feature branches, release and release2 are the release branchesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnp1g1.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 6315 pA set of integers is said to be linear if it is of the form pqi  i  N, for xed p, q  N. For example, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, . . . is a linear set with p  3, q  4. A set of integers is said to be semilinear if it is the nite union of linear sets. For example, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, . . . can be written as the union of 3, 7, 11, 15, . . . and 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, . . .. Since both these sets are linear, the set 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, . . . is semilinear. Now consider an alphabet  and a language L  . Dene the spectrum of L as SpecL  n  n  N, L has at least one string of length n. strongShow that if L is regular, then SpecL must be semilinear.strong Could not get a solution to this. Please helpp

Negative 6315 pIm new here and I hope I could get some help with an Android App using Pocketsphinx with NDK.p  pI am doing this work for a school projekt where we are making a GPS and we wanted to add some offline voice recognition, Pocketsphinx seems to be the way to go so I downloaded the libraris sphinxbase and pocketsphinx as well as the demoproject they have. p  pAfter quiet a lot of fixing and trying first of installing and getting used to Ubuntu, fixing errors I got when trying to compile the libraries, errors from trying to build the libraries with the NDK to get the .so file, problems with the project not having right libraries for Android and transforming it to a 2.1 project to test on my phone I was able to get the program to runthough for some reason I have to lanch it 2 ro 3 times before it shows up on my phone.p  pMy problem appears when I try to use the demo project, for those that dont know how it looks its just a simple text area and a button, you press the button so it starts recording and then you speak and the inputed speech should appear as text in the area, as soon as I click this button it closes. It doesnt crash, the process dies but I dont get a stacktrace. From what I can see from the debug information it starts the recording process but then crashes after this, my guess is it crashes once it is about to start doing the work with the native code.p  pWhat I can understand from the unclear debug information I get is that the Native enviroment is being closed, I get a message from the debug with the tag Zygote and the message being Process X terminated by signal11. From my searching I have learnt that this most likely means a segmentation fault SIGSEGV. p  pThis is as far as I have gotten, I have no real understanding of what segmentation fault means or how to resolve this problem. Below Ill add a part of the log, this is what I see before the program dies, if you need anymore information from the logs plese tell me what and how to get it as I am very unsure what information will be helpful. p  pI am working on Ubuntu 11.10 with Eclipse and the Android pluggins, my phone is a Sony Ericsson Xperia if thats relevant, running some Sony Ericsson version of Android 2.1, the sphinx libraries are the latest version from the Sphinx projects website.  p  pHope someone here can give me some way to keep working on this, I am mostly a Java developer but I have done some work in C so if I have to Ill dig into the C code as well but I hope it wont go that far.p  pHere is the log extractp  precode0320 113722.676 Dedu.cmu.pocketsphinx.demo.RecognizerTask385 signalling START 0320

This leaves some color from the previous frames, creating a blurring or dazed effect if things on the canvas object are moving from frame to frame.p  pIs there something for rendering images that is comparable to setting the context.fillStyle to an ARGB value for primitive shapesp  pIs there a multiply mode ie multiply the image pixel color by the destination color. This could be used for primitive lighting. Ive toyed around with context.globalCompositionOperation but didnt find anything interestingp  pAre there any other cool effects youve come acrossp  pNOTE I dont want to use WebGL for this application, and its a game. That means its realtime and I cant modify each pixel with javascript code because that takes too long. although I could probably do that when the player dies and nothing is moving on the screen anymorep
Negative 6315 pIm currently trying to display all online users on my webpage using the php session variables. To do this, whenever a user logs in or out, a column in a database gets set to online or offline.. However this doesnt entirely work since the database doesnt get updated when the user closes their browser and therefor destroys the session. So is there another way of checking if a certain sessionid is setp  pCurrently I am setting the session like thisp  precodesessionstart  SESSION[username]Example Username codepre  pTo check from the current users page if there is a session variable set we can simply usep  precodeifissetSESSION[username]  username is set  codepre  pBut if we need to check if a specific user is online, how do we get for instance an array of all the session variables that have been set e.g.p  precodeGet all SESSION[username] vars  loop through array and check for specific SESSION  fori0 ...     if SESSION[username][i]  User 1       do something     codepre  pFrom all that Ive read so far, there doesnt seem to be a way to get an array of all sessions on your page.. So is there a better way of doing it, e.g. how do facebook, twitter, etc handle this stuff Thanks for your helpp

Negative 6315 pI asked a while ago about how to make a list of sublists and of even more sublists from a string given delimiters here. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10415752howtoprocessastringintolayerofsublistsHow to process a string into layer of sublistsap  pNow, I need to join them back together and Im not sure how.

Is there a way to iterate through each level of sublist  I can leave this as a separate question, one step at a time..  but just wondering whether this process is making sense or should I try an entire new method.

Negative 6315 pI want to perform serialisation of some object graph in a modular way. That is I dont want to serialize the whole graph. The reason is that this graph is big. I can keep timestamped version of some part of the graph, and i can do some lazy access to postpone loading of the parts i dont need right now.p  pI thought i could manage this with metaprogramming in Python. But it seems that metaprogramming is not strong enough in Python.p  pHeres what i do for now. My graph is composed of several different objects. Some of them are instances of a special class. This class describes the root object to be pickled. This is where the modularity come in. Each time i pickle something it starts from one of those instances and i never pickle two of them at the same time. Whenever there is a reference to another instance, accessible by the root object, I replace this reference by a persistantid, thus ensuring that i wont have two of them in the same pickling stream. The problem comes when unpickling the stream. I can found a persistantid of an instance which is not loaded yet. When this is the case, i have to wait for the target instance to be loaded before allowing access to it. And i dont see anyway to do that p  p1 I tried to build an accessor which stronggetstrong methods return the target of the reference. Unfortunately, accessors must be placed in the class declaration, I cant assign them to the unpickled object. 2 I could store somewhere the places where references have to be resolved. I dont think this is possible in Python  one cant keep reference to a place a field, or a variable, it is only possible to keep a reference to a value.p  pMy problem may not be clear. Im still looking for a clear formulation. I tried other things like using explicit references which would be instances of some Reference class. It isnt very convenient though. p  pDo you have any idea how to implement modular serialisation with pickle  Would i have to change internal behaviour of Unpickler to be able to remember places where i need to load the remaining of the object graph  Is there another library more suitable to achieve similar results p

Negative 6315 pIve been working on a project which uses rabbitmq to communicate. Recently we discovered that it would be much scalable if we used rabbit routing feature. So basically we bind the queue to several routing keys and use an exchange with type codedirectcode.p  pIts working like publishsubscribe. So its possible to bind and unbind the queue to different events so consumerssubscribers only receive messages to which theyre interested.p  pOf course, the producerpublisher now uses the binding key event name as coderoutingkeycode to pass it to pika implementation. However, when it publishes something for a binding that doesnt exist the message is lost, i.e. when nobody bound a queue for event codefoocode, but some publisher calls codepika.basicpublish..., routingkeyfoocode.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong p  pIs it possible to know if the message was actually published in a queuep  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrongp  ul lipChecking the return value of pika.basicpublish. It always returns codeNonecode.pli lipCheck if theres an exception when we try to publish for a binding that doesnt exist. There is none.pli lipHaving an additional queue to make out of band control since all subscribers are run by the same process. This approach feels like killing a fly with a bazooka and I refuse to keep it. Moreover, I thought I should shoot myself just for actually trying it.pli ul  pstrongAdditional infostrongp  ul lipSince Im using this routing feature, the queue names are generated by rabbit. I dont have any problem if the new approach has to name the queue itself.pli lipIf a new approach is suggested which requires binding to exchanges instead of queues, I would like to hear them, but I would prefer to avoid them as theyre not actually AMQP and are an extension implemented by rabbitmq.pli lippika version is 0.9.5pli liprabbitmq version is 2.8pli ul  pThanks a lotp

Half the lines are greyed out by resharper perhaps and there is no autowatch of variables or highlighting of which line the code is currently breaking on.p

Negative 6315 pIm trying to figure out the best way to take a user uploaded image, resize it, and store the original image as well as the resized image on Amazon S3.p  pIm running Django 1.5, using PIL to resize the image, and using Boto to handle uploading the image file to S3. Right now Ive got it to work by uploading the original image to S3, using PIL to open the image using the S3 path and resize it, and then saving the resized version to S3, however this doesnt seem to be the most efficient way to do this. p  pIm wondering if theres a way to resize the image before uploading to S3 using the useruploaded image itself been having trouble getting PIL to open the image file itself, and whether this would be faster than the way Ive set things up now. I cant seem to find an answer to this, either in the PIL documentation or anywhere else. I should mention that I dont want to just use a third party app to handle this, as part of my goal is to learn and understand fundamentally what is going on.p  pIs there a more efficient way to do this than what Ive currently set up A general explanation of what is happening at each step and why it makes the most sense to set things up that way would be ideal.p  pI should also mention that it seems to take much longer to upload the image to S3 than when I was just storing the image on my server. Is there a normal lag when uploading to S3 or is there potentially something in how things are set up that could be slowing down the S3 uploadsp

And objshared reference some native lib of Android libsharedindirect. For this case, can I say thosep  ol liThe total size equals all memory used by objprivate  libprivate  objshared  libshared  libsharedindirect. li liThe private dirty equals memory dirtied by objprivate  libprivateli ol  pThe reason we want to make clear about this is there are some unusual runtimememory increase of our latest version app compared to previous version. And when I used the dumpsys meminfo, I found the columns native and other increased dramatically. But the change of the new version is only related to java and there is no explain about the other column. I googled this and found no document. I also tried to read the source code of the adb. But I found its easy to get lost in the source code for novice like me. So I post this question here in case that some one can help.p

Negative 6315 pWere building a web app for which wed like to use dropbox as image storage. Basic idea is to have users work in teams. A team represents a real world company. Each team has its own Dropbox account owned by the company. p  pUsers log into our web app and can see their teams shared images. We dont want individual users to know the Dropbox account credentials  the account is owned by the company. Now we come to the technical problem  how do we ship those images from our web application to the users browserp  ol lipId prefer if we could somehow directly ship it from Dropbox servers to the users browser. That would imply somehow transferring the oauth token from the server to the users browser. Not sure if this is even legal  Alternatively, we could generate a publicly available URL for each of the images and ship that URL to the users browser. I dont think thats a good practice from the privacy perspective.pli lipWe can do it through our server  our server reads data form Dropbox and ships it to the users browser. That way our app has the oauth token and picks all needed data from dropbox and ships it to the client. A problem with that approach is the unnecessary load going through our server  we pick the image up from dropbox and ship it to the user.pli ol  pDid anyone else have a similar problem What would be the best approach to this We dont want to switch image storage provider  lets just say our users want it to be Dropbox p

Negative 6315 pIm trying to login the user using the codeHttpServletRequest.logincode method. I have setup my codeweb.xmlcode, created a codelogin.xhtmlcode, and mapped the action of the login button to my backing bean method called codeperformLogincodep  pThe problem is to get the URL from where the user was redirected. Ie. he attempted to go to codeindex.xhtmlcode, but did not have a session, so is redirected to codelogin.xhtmlcode. I want to get the url he requested in the first place, so I try reading the codeRequestDispatcher.FORWARDREQUESTURIcode from the request map as described by balusC here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12245749JSF 2.0  How to redirect to the protected page after using HttpServletRequest.logina p  pThis does not work when using websphere, I guess because it does not forward, but redirect the user to the login page. However, since Websphere itself is able to do the correct forwarding when using the built in codejsecuritycheckcode action in the httpform, this must be possible to accomplishp  pSo, my question is basically how can I get hold of this uri in order to forward the user to the correct page when logged in successfully, while running on webspherep

Negative 6315 pI have searched for keywords such as em2D, drawing, algorithmem but have not found or at least noticed if this could be a duplication on SOF so please let me know then I will be happy to delete it in order to follow StackOverFlow policyp  pLong story short, I need to know if anybody have used or is aware of an optimized algorithm for moving a rectangle in 2D on a canvas. Currently we are using WPFp  pHere is our code and our problem is with moving object that are connected in nodepoint with a rectangle which being moved using mouse. Consider a scenario where user grabs a node lets say bottom right corner and drags it on canvas. p  pThe rectangle moves OK but when it has other shapes connected to it e.g. another rectangle, line or circle. Currently it goes wrong and designsketch goes out of shape.p  pI guess, to clarify my question maybe I should be asking this Which algorithm or what kind of Data Structure can help me to track and maintain the connection of other linked shapes to this rectanglep  pAny helpful feedback is appreciated.p  pNOTE  strongOK, one thing I need to add up here is that our code was working fine in all cases however, we noticed that when our shape or drawing gets complicated moving the whole design or object is taking too much time. what we had done in previous version as far as rectangle was connecting two lines where a list would store all the connectivity information so for a rectangle we were storing information in each Start and End point of a line.  However, in the new version being developed we used an object from Point class to store  those information. Hence, instead of storing information in 8 points we are storing connectivity information in 4 points hoping that would optimize the system. Now, we have run into this connectivity issues where moving a rectangle is not happening properly and a rectangle can turn into a broken rectangle or even a single line.

Negative 6315 pI am trying to figure out a way to do an internet connectivity check for an AIR for iOS app. Previously, I was using against my better judgement a codeURLMonitorcode that checked Google once every 30 seconds. I did not like putting that load onto Google and neither did they this morning, our network got flagged as a possible DDoS attacker simply from testing the app. So I had to disable this type of check and move on.p  pI have thought about using the a hrefhttpwww.adobe.comdevnetairnativeextensionsforairextensionsnetworkinfo.html relnofollowcodeNetworkInfocode ANEa from Adobe, but that presents its own issues in determining internet connectivity. The only way I can think of doing it is to check for interfaces en0 and pdpxx which correspond to WiFi and Cellular interfaces, respectively and check their IPs to ensure they are not in the 192.168.x.x, 10.10.x.x, or 127.0.x.x ranges. However, I am not entirely sure those are the only static routerlocalhost IPs out there and there is always the possibility that the network interface names will change in the future, which would render this monitor useless. There is also the issue of IPv6 possibly throwing a wrench into this method as well.p  pIs there another way to check if the user is connected to the internet Ive searched multiple times and it seems that these are the only two ways to check.

Negative 6315 pstrongContextstrong I have an iOS game application which uses GCD. For the application, I have three queues  Main Queue, Game Logic Queue Custom serial, Physics Queue Custom serial. Physics Queue is used to do the physics simulation and Game Queue is used to do the game logic. So for every update every 160 seconds, each queue does its respective work and then shares it with other queues by scheduling blocks on the other queues.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pstrongWith GCDstrong When I play a game level i.e. the queue are doing some work, I see a very rapid growth in my heapallocations which leads to the app crashing due to memory problems. If I quit the level and come to a nongame view i.e. the queue are NOT doing any work, the memory slowly drops down takes about 2 minutes and becomes stable. In the image attached, the peak in the image is just before I quit the game level and come outside. After that there is a steady drop in memory as the objects get deallocated.p  pstrongWithout GCDstrong If I disable the other two queues and run everything on the main queue i.e. I eliminate all concurrency from my code, I do NOT see any significant heap growth and the game works just fine.p  pstrongAlready studiedtriedresearched on the internetstrong I have a brief understanding of the concepts of block capture and the block being copied to the heap but am not very sure. As far as my understanding goes, I have been unable to find any such object in my code as when I quit the game level and come to the nongame view, all the objects that are expected to be deallocated are being deallocated.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liThe App with GCD creates a lot of blocks. Is it a good practice to create a lot of blocksli liOn running instruments, I find that the objects rapidly getting allocated but not getting released are of the category Malloc 48. The Responsible Library for these objects is libsystemblocks.dylib and the Responsible caller is Blockcopyinternal. These objects slowly get deallocated once I come out of my game level i.e. when the queues stop performing any work. However, the deallocation is very slow and takes about 2 minutes to fully clean up. Is there any way this clean up can be accelerated My suspision is that the objects keep piling up and then cause the memory crash.li ol  pAny ideas as to what may be going onp  pThanks in advance. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIiHEg.png altenter image description herep  pBased on the suggestions from the below comments I wrote the following test code.

Negative 6315 pIve been looking on Stackoverflow to find a way to reload a page in the same way F5 does. I mean I have the following problemp  pI have a php page containing a form lets say data.php and a table containing a DB data. Form calls another php page to execute an action action.php via post method. Action.php is called and my DB is updated. Now I want to go back in data.php and I want table to be updated reading changes in my DB.p  pWhat I did was trying in action.php the followingp  ol liHeaderLocation data.php this didnt work because it sent me to data.php but I couldnt see any change in the table before refreshing the page via F5, I found it is due to the fact php is a serverside language so it cant act on your browser and tell it to reload the page, is that correctli liHeaderLocation data.phpureload then in data.php a control on GET[u], if that variable equal to reload I made data.php set header data.php and then call a jscript location.reload. Again I hadnt any change in the table.li ol  pNow I would like data.php table to be automatically refreshed after DB updates so to make user able to immediately see changes he introduced without the need of manually reload the page, how can I dop  pThanks a lotp  pEDITp  pWhat it actually happens is the following I have a folder where images are stored in the form imgID.EXT and a DB where images data is stored in the form ID,EXT,TEXT. Data.php loads a list of images ordered by ID with their own text and has buttons to modify the list something like every image has moveup button, movedown button, delete button. When I call moveup I go to action.php and it changes ID of image moving it up in the list and changing the name in the image folder, then go back to data.php.p  pI have that after redirecting I see images in the same position as before but for example TEXT of image5 correctly swap with TEXT of image4. When I refresh using F5 or browser button to reload the page image5 swaps with image4 and everything is ok. I would like anything to swap without the need of using F5 but just cant understand what is the problem.p

Negative 6315 pRight now Im using Djangos built in admin system to manage users, to which Ive attached a profile to contain additional data using the followingp  precodeclass Profilemodels.Model     user  models.OneToOneFieldUser, editable  False      Data fields here... codepre  pAs it stands the User and Profile pk and accordingly id number will be the same if and only if the profile is created right after the user is created. I could guarantee that this would be the case during the registration process, and while that would cover most uses, creating users with the admin interface could cause mismatched ids to occur. Thus this does not seem like a very robust way to solve this problem and Id like to hardcode the pks to be the same.

This highlighted the bug, and I hacked around it last night using codepkuser.profile.idcode instead. In the light of the morning this does not seem like such a terrible hack. However, it seems like having pk discrepancies could lead to quiet and hard to catch bugs down the line, and thus forcing them to match up would be a Good Idea. But Im new to Django so Id entirely accept that it is, in fact, never a problem if youre writing your code correctly. That said, for almost academic reasons, Id be curious to see how this emmightem be solved.  p  pstrong[edit]strongp

Negative 6315 pWorking on an API for iOS, I wrote a couple of shaders that are very important for the API. These shaders are in the form of vsh and fsh files. Now, working on real projects with the API , I discovered that when we add the folder with the API source to an Xcode iOS project, we have to do an additional step, consisting in adding the file to Copy Bundle Resources in the Build Phases tab of the project configuration. So, we are thinking in a best way to handle this issue and with best I meant that step shouldnt exist at all since the shaders are loaded as strings to the GPU, so, what will be the best way to handle these shaders in the APIp
Negative 6315 pI have a class called codeTexturecode. This class is responsible for managing a texture. In the programs startup the OpenGL context is initialised properly which is what makes this question different from most involving unexpected glGenTextures behaviour. codeTexturecode gets a texture name from codeglGenTexturescode and then loads and binds image data into memory for that texture name int the function codetexGLInitcode.  This works, and the texture is displayed exactly as expected.p  pHowever, I also want my Texture to be able to change the texture that it displays when a user clicks a button and selects one from the HDD in an codeOpenFileDiaglogcode. The function for this is called codereloadTexturecode. This function attempts to delete the old imagepixel data from memory and replace it with new data from a file selected by the user.  However when this happens, it deletes the texture name using codeglDeleteTexturescode, and then assigns a new texture name and loads the new pixel data into memory using the function codetexGLInitcode. But the texture name is exactly the same as the one before usually 1 100 of the time. p  pThe image displayed after this happens is odd. It has the new images dimensions, but still the old images pixels. Put simply, it distorts the old image down to the new images size. Its still drawing using the supposedly deleted pixel data. What should happen is that the screen now displays the new image file on screen. I believe this is something to do with the texture name not being unique. p  pThe code is included belowp  precodeTextureTexturestring filenameConstructor loads in the initial image.

It is when I want to have multiple subclasses of another class that a problem arise.p  pI am testing this with the following code  p  pTestMessage.TestMessageSubClass sub  new TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass         byte[] pack  MsgPack.packsub         Assert.assertTrueArrayUtils.isNotEmptypackp  precode    Listlt extends TestMessagegt msg  MsgPack.unpackpack, TestMessage.class     Assert.assertNotNullmsg     Assert.assertFalsemsg.isEmpty     TestMessage temp  msg.get0      Assert.assertNotNulltemp     Assert.assertTruetemp instanceof TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass     TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass sub2  TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass temp     Assert.assertEqualssub, sub2      System.out.printlnsub     System.out.printlnsub2 codepre  pThose two lines fail because when I deserialize I only get a normal TestMessage, and not a TestMessageSubClass instance.p  precode    Assert.assertTruetemp instanceof TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass     TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass sub2  TestMessage.TestMessageSubClass temp codepre  pI suppose that this happens because by default the MessagePack unpacker has no way of determining the exact class of he needs to deserialize. In fact this would work just fine if I directly ask him to deserialize into a TestMessageSubClass.p  pMy requirements is that TestMessage might have any number of subclasses with extra data, and with the same code I need to deserialize them in the right class instance without losing anything. I might be deserializing a stream containing an heterogeneous list of those TestMessage instances.p  pI can have the behaviour I want using the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14378776deserializejsontoclassesJsonSubTypes annotation in JacksonJsona.p  pIs there a way to use the official MessagePack client API and obtain that Is there a known pattern to do that myselfp  pHere is the code of my MsgPack wrapper class a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous6112229 relnofollowGISTap  pAny advice on using MessagePack more efficiently is welcome too.p

Negative 6315 pFirst Ill say Im pretty tired Ive been up about 22 hours straight. Anyway I have this funky physics problem in a PONG game. You know the old classic. I have been looking at the code for a LONG time trying different variation, commenting out certain parts etc. and I cant find the damn bug p  pCan someone give me a hand, pleasep  pIts the physics for the ball thats a problem. It bounces off the top and bottom the screen fine when going left just fine. p  pBut I cant send it going back to the right after it collides with paddle coming to from the left. It just forces bounces off a bit and forces its way back and over the paddlep  pHowever I can send the ball right when I program it to bounce right after hitting one of the top or bottom sides, so I dont think there is anything wrong with the actual code that moves the ball to the right.p  pBut that movement to right is the opposite of the desired physics for the game, so its useless because its supposed to bounce off and go right when it hits the paddle on the left, its not supposed to force it self over the paddle and go left.p  pIts actually kind of funny if you could see itp  pCan anybody make sense of this and give me an explanation for thisp  p[code]p  precode     move the ball around       if the ball disappears off the either side of the screen, send it back heading  left     if ballRect.left gt WINDOWWIDTH or ballRect.right lt 0         direction  getRandomDirection         ballRect.center  WINDOWWIDTH  ballRect.width, random.randint100, 200      if direction  downleft         ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX         ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY     if direction  upleft         ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX         ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY     if direction  downright         ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX         ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY     if direction  upright         ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX         ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY      if ballRect.top lt 0         if direction  upleft             direction  downleft         if direction  upright             direction  downright     if ballRect.bottom gt WINDOWHEIGHT         if direction  downleft             direction  upleft         if direction  downright             direction  upright      if paddleRect.colliderectballRect         if direction  upleft             direction  upright             ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX             ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY         if direction  upright             direction  upleft             ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX             ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY         if direction  downleft             direction  upleft             ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX             ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY         if direction  downright             direction  upright             ballRect.left  BALLSPEEDX             ballRect.top  BALLSPEEDY codepre  p[code]p

Negative 6315 pHow do you set a specific localelanguage when using the PHP API for Twitter, as there doesnt seem to be an optionp  pI can set a language for the pluginsbuttons when using HTMLJavaScript, but I cant see anywhere for a PHP API call. Theres nothing in the docs.p  pE.g. Ive looked on a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comdocsapi1.1 relnofollowhttpsdev.twitter.comdocsapi1.1a but theres nothing about setting a language. The responses often include a language, but thats obviously not the same thing.p  pAs an example, when getting info of a user in a PHP API call, Facebooks API will return male or homme if the users sex is male, depending on if the language is set to English or French default English.p  pOf course sometimes you want to always return English in an API call if your programming code relies on testing for male or female, but if youre just outputting the exact response of the sex field e.g. a user profile then you would want to use the same language as the rest of the site.p

Negative 6315 pI have a problem and after three days I still can not find a answer.p  pI am creating a usercontrol. This control has two controls hosted on it. One is an edit field and the other is a margin that will hold line numbers and other user added stuff.p  pWhat I am trying to do is instantiate these to separate controls in their own threads and perform all tasks on these threads eg painting and updating. The usercontrol thread will simply filter messages and direct same to the correct control. I will be doing this by overriding the WndProc method. p  pDoing all the message stuff I am fine with however how do I instantiate the controls. Once the thread that creates these controls finishes wont the threads die and the controls became inaccessible. Sorry no code at the moment, I tend to do a lot of research before any coding but I cant seem to find anything that can be of help.p

Negative 6315 pCan two threads use the same socket at the same timep  pfor example, first i open a socket that represents a connection between Android client and windows 7 server.  i want to send an integer that is the size of the file by using DataOutputStream, then after this i will use BufferedOutputStream to send the binary file, such as a pdfp  pthe server will get the size sent by the client and then check if the size of the file received is the correct size. it compares the send integer, file size number with the actual size of the file received.  if there is any difference than the server knows that the file is not complete and then it will send a message back to the client to request that the file be sent again.p  pi have an app where the file is received as incomplete about 5 of the time. it arrives smaller than the actual size.  the only way to fix this problem is to resend the file again if it is not completep  pif i send a file, it is required to have a port open and waiting to receive a message back from the server telling the client if the file was received complete or has to be resent.p  pso is it possible to have one thread using the socket and listening for any messages and on another thread sending a message.  so that if a message is being received back from the server at the same time one is being sent.p  pit is clear that using only one thread will block and that two threads are needed but to use the same socket are there possible problems with thisp

Also, I dont want unnecessary properties well, it is not a big problem, but nevertheless.li lidisable ARC for ImageGetter and manually retain at start itself and release after sending image to callback.li limake static manager ImageGetterManager, which will have method coderequestImage...code, it will create ImageGetter instances, retain them, redirect the coderequestImage...code call, get callbacks from them and release. That seems the most consistent way, but is not it a bit complex for such a little codeli ol  pSo how can I build such a classp

Negative 6315 pSo I have a probably not so unique scenario. The simplest way to explain it is a google map with all 50 US states, each state will have two markers. The markers are both driven by the same latlong value. The problem Im having is that the markers are rendering ontop of one another. I somehow need to have them render next to one another or offset so that I can see both. The problem is how do I get it to not overlap into another state. p  pI saw some really neat spider functionality where it renders one marker and then if you click on it the others fan out, but the website was in another language. p  pI am going to try and use the following library. p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comjawjOverlappingMarkerSpiderfier relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjawjOverlappingMarkerSpiderfierap  pThe problem with the above implementation is that I am using a combination of KML and google maps clientside.

I a hrefhttpwww.altdevblogaday.com20131202usingstlvectors relnofollowjust read a bloga that asserts that the capacity ends up being on average 1.5 times the actual final required buffer size, but there is no explanation. I suppose the reasoning goes like thisp  ul liwith 2n items, there is no overallocation f1li liwith 2n1 items, there is an overallocation of nearly f2li ul  pSo on average, it would follow that the overallocation factor is f1.5... But while it is obvious that the lower and upper bounds are f1 and f2, I am not convinced that it follows that 1.5 is the correct average.

Negative 6315 pIn studying for the Java certification test I learned that static initialization blocks run once when the class is loaded, in order of appearance within the source code, that instance initialization blocks run each time an instance is created, and that code in constructors runs each time an instance is created after that. To test that I created a class with some static and instance init blocks and a contructor with print stuff. Everything worked as expected  except I thought loaded meant just at runtime, but I guess it happens when the first instance is created, since I dont get any output at all unless I create at least 1 instance of the class. Then I tried the same with an enum and the order was all off. First, the initialization blocks run one time for each value the enum has when the enum is first referenced in code, secondly  the init blocks marked static run after what I assumed were instance init blocks This is the opposite of what I expected. Here is a breakdown of my questions.p  ol liWhy do the init blocks marked static run last in an enum li liCan an enum have instance init blocksli liWhy do the blocks I thought were instance init blocks run only once when the enum is loaded and not each time a new enum value is referencedli liClass static init blocks run when a class is loaded.

Negative 6315 pIm working on project in Java but I think it doesnt depend on the language where Im generating small 4 states max nondeterministic finite state automata on binary alphabet and I have to check fast the generated automaton for equivalence with the previous ones. Therefore, I have to use some good hash function, to avoid compairing with too many automatas.p  pMy first thought was doing a DFS on the transitions and finding all the accepted words until length max. 5 and then I map the set of accepted words to a 64bit long the amount of binary words of length max. 5. But it seems to produce too many collisions on NFAs with 4 states. Increasing the length results in making the computing of the hash code too slow for practical use.p  pAnother approach was having a set of words and testing which of them the automaton accepts but finding the right ones, I think, isnt that trivial. p  pDo you have any idea how to improve the hash function to avoid too many collisions without a significant loss of speedp  pThanks in advancep

Id like it to replace the form, then insert a new list item below with the same form so the user can continue to add items to the list in this manor. p  pitems.htmlp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml ngappgt   ltheadgt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.2.6angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcitems.jsgtltscriptgt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     lth2gtItemslth2gt     ltdiv ngcontrollerItemCtrlgt       ltolgt         ltligt           ltform ngsubmitaddItemgt            ltinput typetext ngmodelitemText  size30                   placeholderadd new item to listgt            ltinput classbtnprimary typesubmit valueaddgt           ltformgt         ltligt         ltli ngrepeatitem in itemsgt           ltspangtitem.textltspangt         ltligt       ltolgt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pitems.jsp  precodefunction ItemCtrlscope    scope.items  []    scope.addItem  function      scope.items.pushtextscope.itemText     scope.itemText       codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netkL4rp relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netkL4rpap  pHow do I get that to work as describedp  pThanksp

Negative 6315 pIm new on here, but not a total beginner to programming. I got a book on creating a 2D DirectX game engine so I could expand my programming knowledge, however I am new to C and DirectX itself, so Im afraid Im a bit clueless on working with multiple project files and headers. I decided to develop my game engine in a proper development environment, so I got VS2013 Professional though the Dreamspark program.p  pAs I said, I havent worked with something like VS before, so Im hitting issues with getting my game engine running and Im not sure what to do. The book said that if I get all my code down correctly in 3 .cpp source files, 3 headers and 1 main .cpp source file to initialize my engine in a blank game project the program should compile fine, and it does. The issue is that I only get the resultant .obj files and the projects static library file to appear in my project folder. I dont know what I have to do to get the project to compile the executable needed to actually run this blank game with the engine.p  pThe actual project solution was taken from the disk which came with the book, I wrote my code on top of that solution as my own was causing linker errors. The project properties show that the project is defined as a .lib project, so how is this supposed to work p  pI apologize if this is a simple problem, but Im only used to working with 1 file console applications in C, this is a big jump for me but Id like to understand how Im meant to get an .exe created from this project, I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me how this sort of .lib project works. I can post the code if its necessary, but theres 7 files of it so its quite long. Thanksp

Negative 6315 pmost likely a dumb question, but cant you both update and redraw everything at once in a single function rather than calling two functions back to back, whats the advantage of updating then drawingp
Negative 6315 pI have checked number of answers regarding promises, but I cant get my code working perhaps Im doing something terribly wrong in other placep  pIn general Im working on small test application using AngularJS and SignalR. I have signalR service which looks like thisp  precodefunction   use strict  var serviceId  signalRSvc angular.moduleapp.serviceserviceId, [rootScope, signalrcontext]  function signalrcontext rootScope      var performanceHub  null     var connection  null              var service           initialize initialize,         getPerformanceCounters getPerformanceCounters,         getAllValues getAllValues           return service      function initialize          connection  .connection          performanceHub  connection.webServicePerformanceHub         connection.hub.logging  true          performanceHub.client.updatePerformanceData  functionperformanceData              rootScope.emitupdatePerformanceData, performanceData                   return connection.hub.start           function getPerformanceCounters          return performanceHub.server.getPerformanceCounters           function getAllValuesid          return performanceHub.server.getAllValuesid        codepre  pWhat im trying to do is to initilize SignalR, then execute method getPerformanceCounters which will download list of counters to render returned as array of objects, then for each counter I would like to get the data, and here problem starts. According to MS documents, SignalR proxy methods are returning promises. I have wrote this code, but i have no idea why it is not working on step getAllValues according to this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18673890angularjspromisesqdeferAngularJS Promises, q, defera it should workp  precode   function initSignalR          return signalRSvc.initialize.thenfunction                              return signalRSvc.getPerformanceCounters         .thenfunctionconfigurations              logperformance counters configuration downloaded             return getAllValuesconfigurations         .thenfunction resultData              vm.resultData  resultData                    function getAllValuesconfigurations          var promises  new Array          angular.forEachconfigurations, functionconfiguration              promises.pushsignalRSvc.getAllValuesconfiguration.Id                   return q.allpromises      codepre  pIn my understanding, last then should execute when all calls to signalRSvc.getAllValues are completed and resultData should contain array of objects returned from those promises. Instead of this, Im getting some garbage which is not even an array. p  pSurprisingly for me of course when I do something like thisp  precode    function getAllValuesconfigurations          var promises  new Array          angular.forEachconfigurations, functionconfiguration              promises.pushsignalRSvc.getAllValuesconfiguration.Id                   return q.allpromises.thenfunctionresultData               here result data is fine               codepre  pin nested then result data is fine but of course the order of resolving promises is messed up.p  pThanks for help in advance since im out of ideas.  p

Our issue is that we need a custom post type for our portfolio, where my base url should really be work, then probably workdigital, workcgi and so on. I created the custom post type and the taxonomy as well, but no matter what i do, the url for all my custom posts begin with labs.p  pI tried loads of suggestions, from rewriting rules to changing the rewrite parameter in the registertaxonomy function. The code i am using is belowp  precodefunction createposttype  registerposttype ourwork,     array         labels gt array             name gt  Work Items ,             singularname gt  Work Item          ,         public gt true,         hasarchive gt true,         rewrite gt arrayslug gt work,         supports gt array             title,             editor,             excerpt,             customfields,             revisions,             thumbnail,             pageattributes            ,        addaction init, createposttype   function createtaxonomies  registertaxonomyworkcategories, arrayourwork, array     labels gt array         name gt Work Categories     ,     showui gt true,     showtagcloud gt false,     rewrite gt true,     hierarchical gt true,     withfront gt false   addactioninit, createtaxonomies codepre  pHave tried to change the rewrite parameter to true, false, hierarchical and even replace it with  or the  name of the custom post type.. p  pIs it even possible to do that All we essentially want to do here is have the blog and custom posts sit under 2 different base paths, i would think this would be easy enough to dop  psorry if this was covered before, the terminology is mixed up and search results bring up anything really remote to this matter.p  pThanksp

Negative 6315 pI am new to WCF and from what I have researched I understand its not a good thing to return a dataset or a datatable from a WCF service. I also understand that the best way is convert your data into a DTO and then pass it on to the client.p  pThe problem I am facing is that I need to create some reports that can have different number of columns and I only want to create one method in my web service to retrieve the data based on query name that will be supplied as a parameter. This makes it difficult for me to create a  object class and map it to my data table as the numbertype of columns would be different for each report.p  pWhat is the best way to achieve this I have gone through a number of blogs but still havent found a good way of doing this.p  pEDIT  I tried returning a datatable and got some errors which lead me to the blogs that explained why datasetsdatatables were not a good idea for returning data in webservices. p

Negative 6315 pIve been trying to learn about modern OpenGLGLSL recently, and that has taken me to the subject of FBOs, and Ive encountered a mysterious problem.p  pIn my program, I initialize an FBO, then unbind it. Everything works so far. I then bind the FBO, and render my scene to it. I get a blank screen now when I run this program, but thats normal  Im not rendering the output. However, when I try to do that, or attempt to render anything at all, I still get the black screen. I can make it work only if I dont bind the FBO during the main loop.    I have had FBOs working in Java, using LWJGL, and this is the second time Ive attempted to render an FBO in C, with SDL, and both times I came across the same bug.p  pWhat it isntp  ul liThe texture  Ive already tried drawing other textures after using the FBOli liThe shader  Ive tried my other shader on thisli liMy wrapper classes used  they have all been proven to work when using other systems.li ul  pAlso, glChackFramebufferStatusGLFRAMEBUFFER returns GLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETE, and glGetError returns 0. Also, I understand that there are a few things I havent done which would be sensible depth buffer for example, that dont affect this bug.

Negative 6315 pI am using Tomcat 7.0, Spring 4.0.2, Web Module 3.0 in eclipse for my web application. And I configured my session timeout in appweb.xml as well as tomcatconfweb.xml.p  precodeltsessionconfiggtltsessiontimeoutgt30ltsessiontimeoutgtltsessionconfiggt codepre  pI know that tomcat must reset its internal timer for calculate this 30 mins and invalidate session session timeout on some eventsactionsrequests.p  pI am sending one request called strongcaptureLastActiveTimeForCurrentFilestrong after every 5 mins. So now application server will never invalidate session because I am sending request after every 5 mins, so it will reset its strongsession timeout timerstrong after every 5 mins. p  pNow my problem is that how to ignore any particular request here, strongcaptureLastActiveTimeForCurrentFilestrong for resetting strongsession timeout timerstrong. It means when I send strongcaptureLastActiveTimeForCurrentFilestrong request, server must not reset its timer. For All others requests it should work as it is how it is already working. So suppose if I do not send any other excluding strongcaptureLastActiveTimeForCurrentFilestrong requests to server, it must be invalidate session after 30 mins.p  pThe solution I can think  BR  I will configure session timeout very long time in web.xml file.BR  I will capture stronglast request timestrong in one Global variable after every request call on server excluding strongcaptureLastActiveTimeForCurrentFilestrongBR  I will start my own scheduler which will run after every 5 min and It will check stronglast request time  current time  30 minsstrong, then I will invalidate session manually.BRp  pBut I think this solution is complected and performance wise not good idea.p  pIs it any other way by which I can configure strongexcluded requestsstrong on server, so that Server will ignore that particular request.p  pCorrect me if any of my assumptions are made wrong.

Negative 6315 pSo, I have three classes that I am using to represent a program that is suppose to alternate between an on lightbulb image and an off lightbulb image when the on button is clicked, then switch to the off button image when its clicked again. Initially, when the program starts, its default is set to ON, but it stays as the ON image and doesnt alternate, when you clcik the button twice, the program just freezes I guess it creates an infinite loop.

Negative 6315 pIm trying to upload a file with the google app engine blobstore.p  pIts supposed to work like this you call the BlobstoreService to get an upload url, supplying a callback URL.  The client is redirected to the upload URL, sends the data, then when theyve finished they will be redirected to the callback URL with a couple of parameters which represent the blobstore key.p  pThe dev server behaves differently to the production server as we shall see.p  pAgainst production, my code gets as far as completing the upload, then instead of getting a redirect back to my callback URL, I get a 400 error response implying something wrong with my request.  How do I debug this in production  I dont know how to switch on logging for the blobstore.p  pSo I tried to run it locally against the dev server.  This time if I dont set the contentlength property, I get a 411 content length not set.  But if I try and set that property, I get IllegalStateException Already connected.  Neither of these exceptions happen against production.  p  pSo I dont know where to go next.  I need to either get it working against dev, in the hope that I can debug the blobstore locally, or work out why its not working on the blobstore in production.p  precode    public void uploadString uri, File file throws IOException         HttpURLConnection connnull     HttpURLConnection conn2null     FileInputStream fileInputStream  null     DataOutputStream dosnull     try          String lineEnd  rn         String twoHyphens           String boundary           int bytesRead, bytesAvailable, bufferSize         byte[] buffer         int maxBufferSize  1  1024  1024           open a URL connection to the Servlet         fileInputStream  new FileInputStreamfile         URL url  new URLuri           Open a HTTP  connection to  the URL         conn  HttpURLConnection url.openConnection         conn.setDoInputtrue  Allow Inputs         conn.setDoOutputtrue  Allow Outputs         conn.setUseCachesfalse  Dont use a Cached Copy         conn.setInstanceFollowRedirectsfalse         conn.setRequestMethodPOST         conn.setRequestPropertyConnection, KeepAlive         conn.setRequestPropertyENCTYPE, multipartformdata         conn.setRequestPropertyContentType, multipartformdataboundary  boundary           conn.setChunkedStreamingMode1024         conn.setRequestPropertycontentlength, String.valueOffile.length   caused IllegalStateException Already connected locally, but not remotely          logOrignal URL   conn.getURL         conn.connect   TODO duplicates url.openConnection above         conn.getInputStream  so we can follow the redirect         String redirectedUrl  conn.getHeaderFieldLocation         logRedirected URL   redirectedUrl         this is horrible and messy but lets get it working then clean it up later          conn.disconnect         url  new URLredirectedUrl           Open a new HTTP  connection to  the URL         conn2  HttpURLConnection url.openConnection         conn2.setDoInputtrue  Allow Inputs         conn2.setDoOutputtrue  Allow Outputs         conn2.setUseCachesfalse  Dont use a Cached Copy         conn2.setInstanceFollowRedirectsfalse         conn2.setRequestMethodPOST         conn2.setRequestPropertyConnection, KeepAlive         conn2.setRequestPropertyENCTYPE, multipartformdata         conn2.setRequestPropertyContentType, multipartformdataboundary  boundary         conn2.setChunkedStreamingModemaxBufferSize         conn2.setRequestPropertyContentLength, String.valueOffile.length         conn2.connect         dos  new DataOutputStreamconn2.getOutputStream          dos.writeBytestwoHyphens  boundary  lineEnd         dos.writeBytesContentDisposition formdata namemyFilefilenamefile.getName  lineEnd         dos.writeByteslineEnd           create a buffer of  maximum size         bytesAvailable  fileInputStream.available          bufferSize  Math.minbytesAvailable, maxBufferSize         buffer  new byte[bufferSize]           read file and write it into form...         bytesRead  fileInputStream.readbuffer, 0, bufferSize           while bytesRead gt 0              dos.writebuffer, 0, bufferSize             bytesAvailable  fileInputStream.available             bufferSize  Math.minbytesAvailable, maxBufferSize             bytesRead  fileInputStream.readbuffer, 0, bufferSize                      send multipart form data necesssary after file data...         dos.writeByteslineEnd         dos.writeBytestwoHyphens  boundary  twoHyphens  lineEnd           Responses from the server code and message         int serverResponseCode  conn2.getResponseCode         String serverResponseMessage  conn2.getResponseMessage         we are expecting another redirect here         logaaaargh 400 instead of 302 serverResponseCode to conn2.getHeaderFieldLocation     catch IOException e           loge.getMessage         throw e     catchException e          loge.getMessage         throw new IOExceptione        finally          close the streams          if dosnull                  try                  dos.flush                 dos.close             catchIOException ioe                  if fileInputStreamnull             try                  fileInputStream.close             catchIOException ioe          if connnull              try                  conn.disconnect             catchException ioe          if conn2null             try                  conn2.disconnect             catchException ioe        codepre  pNB the serverResponseMessage string above comes back from the production blobstore as Bad Requestp

Negative 6315 pThis is the first time I post something on a forum, so please be gentle. Ive been programming in R for over a year now. p  pIm trying to do a mathematically very simple statistical analysis of large datasets that come directly from a mass spectrometer. As you may know, these instruments are extremely precise and can measure very large, as well as very small voltages precisely 50V to 0.00000000000000010V. The values are then reported to a tabdelimited file, which I can read into R.p  pHowever, at this point, I have the following problem If I convert the data into doubles, I loose significant information. If I keep them in char or factors, I cannot use them and calculate what I need to get. p  pIs there a workaround, so I can keep the precision AND use R Would it be better to use a C based language, such as Matlab Would Matlab be able to do this p

It also has methods for setting and getting the values of each of the fields along with a method to calculate the current age and display the status of a Person. A constructor that sets the isStudying and isEmployed fields to false is also included in the Person class. You are welcome to add additional data fields and methods if you like.p  pc.For your Person, Employee, Student and Retired classes the getStatus method returns the values shown in the table below based on the current values of the attributesp  p1.Finally, create a Java test class that simulates using your Person class.

Negative 6315 pI am looking for a good way to write an instance factory that creates exactly one instance of a class for each thread in other words a threadspecific singleton.p  pLet me add some example code for clarityp  pFirst, an interface that defines a factory in generalp  precodepublic interface FactoryltTgt      public T create  codepre  pFor normal singletons, I can then create an implementation of this interface that wraps another factoryp  precodepublic class SingletonFactoryltTgt implements FactoryltTgt       private final FactoryltTgt factory     private T instance  null      public SingletonFactoryFactoryltTgt factory          this.factory  factory           Override     public T create          if instancenull instance  factory.create         return instance       codepre  pBasically, the first time that codecreatecode is called, this call is forwarded to the provided factory to create one instance of the object. This instance is cached and all future calls to codecreatecode will return that same instance. All I need to do is to make sure that there is only one instance of codeSingletonFactorycode around per objecttype codeTcode.p  pLets say I want to provide exactly one instance of the object bper threadb I could do something like thisp  precodepublic class ThreadSingletonFactoryltTgt implements FactoryltTgt       private final FactoryltTgt     factory     private final MapltThread, Tgt instance      public ThreadSingletonFactoryFactoryltTgt factory          this.factory   factory         this.instance  new HashMapltThread, Tgt           Override     public T create          Thread thread  Thread.currentThread         T result  instance.getthread         if resultnull              result  factory.create             instance.putthread, result                  return result       codepre  pNow, every time codecreatecode is called, the class looks up the current thread in its instance map to see if this thread already has an instance created. If not, it creates a fresh one and remembers it.p  pI see a couple of issues with this naive approachp  ol liHashMap is not thread safe, it might not be an issue since no two threads will ever operate on the same key, but Im not sure.

Negative 6315 pThe computers where I work are locked down very tight, I have one computer I can connect to the internet with, but only Internet Explorer and Outlook can access the internet. I also cannot install software on it. I have a separate standalone computer which I can install or run anything I want on, but I cannot connect it to the internet. p  pI need to download a directory from a gforge svn. Is there a way to do this from my browser I imagine a website where I can enter the address of the directory I need to checkout, and it produces a zip file I can download in Internet Explorer that contains that directory and all of its subdirectories. I need to download the code on my internet connected computer, and transfer it to my standalone computer to run it. p  pIve searched around a bunch and many people have similar problem but dont have the same restrictions as me. For example many people can use a hrefhttpdownloadsvn.codeplex.com relnofollowDownloadSVNa because it is a portable program that doesnt need to install anything on your computer. However, in my case the DownloadSVN executable is not allowed to access the internet. p  pMost github projects, and some gforge projects have an option to download zip of the current directory, that is great, however the gforge svn I need to download does not have this option. I could go through and manually download each individual file, but this would take many hours. p  pNot sure if it matters but Im on windows 7 with internet explorer 10. The key information is I cannot access the internet from any software I install on my computer, so any kind of client software that runs outside of IE will not work maybe something that can run within IE like some kind of javascript would work though. p

Negative 6315 pThe official article about Services claims, that Android services can either be Started or Bound. However, I dont see problem overriding both codeonStartCommandcode and codeonBindcode. The problem is, that this does not seem to work. What I am trying to do is start a Started Service from one Activity, then address that Service through other Activies by binding them to the Service, and, lastly, stopping it like a Started Service. Nevertheless, when I try to bind an Activity to the Service codebindServicecode behaves like its not actually being called I checked it by putting a breakpoint on codeonBindcode . Is using Services both the Started and Bound way possible p

Currently it was feasible to override that query for Oracle installations only by configurations.p  pAnd, by the way, even if I strongcouldstrong test on the dialect implementation via code, the question could be rephrased like In order to test connectivity, can I run a universal query or do I have to run a harmless query that is specific to DBMS or something like thatp

Negative 6315 pThe application Im working on is a simple application for keeping track of client information creating, viewing, editing. Id like to expand the application to be able to include basic information about family members of the clients. p  pI recently discovered the ability to use inheritance in entity framework and would like to create a simple inheritance hierarchy where clients inherit from a class called person because clients keep track of much of the same information as their family members plus some extra stuff. This way, if a family member also became a client they would just need a corresponding entry in the client table with the extra info. p  pWhere Im stuck is how to migrate the existing model to this new model. The changes in the model seem clear, something like thisp  precodepublic class Person       public Int32 ClientID  get set       ... other fields ...   [TableClient] public class Client  Person      ... client specific fields ...  codepre  pbut what changes need to be made to the context and elsewhere to successfully migrate to this new model Just making these changes to the model came up with a blank migration when doing addmigration in NuGet.p  pEdit The migration is no longer blank but adds a discriminator column which I understand is a part of table per hierarchy setup.p

This is reasonable, because GHC ships with a   specific version of transformers. For ghc7.8, this is   transformers0.3.0.0. For some reason, this installed version is not   considered by cabalinstall.

Negative 6315 pCurrently Im working on a simple image editor where you can with a brush alter the alpha channel.p  pMy problem is, when a UIImageView with 0 or near zero alpha image is presented on another UIView, that has a dark color like brown, black, etc, a strange composition appears. Image becomes visible like its alpha has never been changed. When the back UIView is white, everything is normal.p  pYoull want to say keep it white but Im currently using this UIView as the background canvas and user has the ability to change the color.p  pThe captures I took are from Reveal, but the appearance is exactly the same on device as well. Here is what I mean with all this talkp  pThis is an image with 20 alpha set to all its pixels. The image looks ok. From Reveal, I can see that the image has the correct alpha channel. Everyting is as it should be.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWv2OX.jpg altImage with alpha 20p  pHere is the same image with 15 alpha on a darker blue background sorry, while capturing I changed the alpha. From Reveal, everything is again looking normal.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compsZ4N.jpg altBackground color changedp  pBut when you look at the device, this is what you see. This is the same UIImage with 15 alpha set to all pixels and presented in UIImageView.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZNC0W.jpg altWhat is going on herep  pThe image is fully appearing on the background dark blue UIView, like its alpha is not 15. Changing alpha when working on a dark background has not much effect. It simply adds blue all over, or 100 alpha returns to the original image. Even when setting the alpha of all pixels to 0, the image is clearly visible.p  pIs there something Im missing Why this composition or blending of two UIView objects errorbugproblem appearing Is there a value that I am forgetting to set Or is this normal and am I doing something wrongp

Negative 6315 pIm trying to figure out if theres a way to calculate a emminimumem required size for an output buffer, based on the size of the input buffer.p  pThis question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8902924zlibdeflatehowmuchmemorytoallocatezlib, deflate How much memory to allocatea, but not the same.  I am asking about each chunk in isolation, rather than the entire stream.p  pSo suppose we have two buffers codeINPUTcode and codeOUTPUTcode, and we have a codeBUFFERSIZEcode, which is  say, 4096 bytes.  Just a convenient number, no particular reason I choose this size.p  pIf I deflate usingp  precodedeflatestream, ZPARTIALFLUSH codepre  pso that each chunk is compressed, and immediately flushed to the output buffer, is there a way I can guarantee Ill have enough storage in the output buffer without needing to reallocatep  pSuperficially, wed assume that the DEFLATED data will always be emlargerem than the uncompressed input data assuming we use a compression level that is greater than 0.p  pOf course, thats not always the case  especially for small values.  For example, if we deflate a single byte, the deflated data will obviously be larger than the uncompressed data, due to the overhead of things like headers and dictionaries in the LZW stream.p  pThinking about how LZW works, it would seem if our input data is at least 256 bytes meaning that worst case scenario, every single byte is different and we cant really compress anything, we should realize that input size LESS than 256 bytes  zlib headers could potentially require a LARGER output buffer.p  pBut, generally, realworld applications arent going to be compressing small sizes like that.  So assuming an inputoutput buffer of something more like 4K, is there some way to GUARANTEE that the output compressed data will be SMALLER than the input data  p  pAlso, I know about codedeflateBoundcode, but would rather avoid it because of the overhead.p  pOr, to put it another way, is there some emminimum buffer sizeem that I can use for inputoutput buffers that will guarantee that the output data the compressed stream will be smaller than the input data  Or is there always some pathological case that can cause the output stream to be larger than the input stream, regardless of sizep
Negative 6315 pIm getting a strange issue with the Google maps API v3 lib. If I am on a full desktop PC with a mouse and I drag a map, tiles are loaded as the drag is happening.p  pHowever, on a mobile device with a touch screen this is not the case. It seems that the tiles only load at around the same time the dragend event is fired.p  pYou can recreate this by going to any website hosting a map. Drag the map quite far with your mouse and you will see the tiles load as you drag. Then hit F12 on Chrome and toggle into device mode. Reload the page and try the same thing. You will notice that tiles are only loaded when u release the touch.p  pAny help to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 6315 pI am using textrank to extract keywords from documents. I figure the order of words appearance has some influence on the final weights of words importance, which is not so straightforward to understand.p  pLets say we are using an undirected graph, with windows size 2, to do the keyword extraction task for sentence [w1, w2, w3, w4]. When constructing the graph, we could add edges such as w1, w2, w2, w1, w2, w3, w3, w2...In this case, there are only two edges for word w1, but four edges for w2. Given this, without any further computation, w2 has a better chance to be a keyword than w1, and this is only due to the order of appearance. To me it does not make much sense. Is there some method that this factor could be avoidedp

Am I correct about thesep  ol lipWalking the codeStreamcode returned from codedescendantscode consumes resources time and memory  relative to the size of the tree  in the same order of complexity as handcoding the recursion would. In particular, the intermediate objects representing the iteration state codeStreamcodes, codeSpliteratorcodes, ... form a stack and therefore the memory requirement at any given time is in the same order of complexity as the trees depth.pli lipAs I understand a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma292309394235730thisa, as soon as I perform a terminating operation on the codeStreamcode returned from codedescendantscode, the rootlevel call to codeflatMapcode will cause all contained codeStreamcodes  one for each recursive call to codedescendantscode  to be realized immediately. Thus, the resulting codeStreamcode is only lazy on the first level of recursion, but not beyond. emEdited according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma327540714235730Tagir Valeevs answera.empli ol  pIf I understood these points correctly, my question is this strongHow can I define codedescendantscode so that the resulting codeStreamcode is lazystrongp  pI would like the solution to be as elegant as possible, in the sense that I prefer a solution which leaves the iteration state implicit. To clarify what I mean by that I know that I could write a codeSpliteratorcode that walks the tree while maintaining an explicit stack of codeSpliteratorcodes on each level. I would like to avoid that.p  pIs there possibly a way in Java to formulate this as a producerconsumer workflow, like one could use in languages like Julia and Gop
