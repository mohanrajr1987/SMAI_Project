Positive 16163 pCurrently I am working on a problem where I have to log data in a Oracle10g database. I want to store data from up to 40 devices but not necessarily always 40 as one data point, these share a bit of information and the rest is device specific. p  pSo I could either create arrays for every devicespecific column and if the device is in use the according array field is getting populated.p  precodeID TIMESTAMP BOARD DEVICEID[40] ERRORCNT[40] TEMP[40] MOREDATA[40]... codepre  pBut I think I would be wasting a lot of database space by doing it like that, because the arrays would be hardly populatedp  pThe other method I can think of would be to just use the same ID for a multiline entry and then I put as many rows into the table as I have used devices.p  precodeID TIMESTAMP BOARD DEVICEID ERRORCNT TEMP MOREDATA 1  437892    1     1         100       25   xxx 1  437892    1     2         50        28   yyy codepre  pNow the shared information is multiple times in the database and the data is shattered among multiple lines.p  pAnother issue is that there might be columns used by a part of the devices and some do not carry that information, so there might be even more unused fields. So maybe it would be best to create multiple tables and split the devices into groups according to the information they have and log their data in the corresponding tables.p  pI appreciate any help, maybe I am even paranoid about wasted db space and should not worry about that and simply follow the easiest approach, which I think would be the one with arrays.p

Negative 16163 pI have a pretty standard table setup in a current application using the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwiki.NETFramework.NETa a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXMLSchema28W3C29XSDa codeDataSetcode and codeTableAdaptercode features. My codecontractscode table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the codeprimary departmentcode. This column is a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiForeignkeyforeign keya to my codeDepartmentscode table, where I store the basic codedepartment namecode, codeidcode, codenotescode. This is all setup and functioning in my a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMicrosoftSQLServerSQL Servera.p  pWhen I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detectscreates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when Im on my main page and am viewing contract data.p  pHowever, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like thisp  precodeDim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter  taDepartment.FilldtDepartment codepre  pHowever, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, Im guessing since I dont have the codeContractcode codeDataTablecode filled. p  pHow can I fix this problem I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.p

This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.p  pThe program will usually throw the exception on the same rows of the table, but it doesnt appear to be 100 consistent. Sometimes data that had thrown the exception in the past will suddenly work.p  pSome people are undoubtedly wondering why I didnt just SELECT ID, ITEMDESCRIPTION FROM ITEMS in the getItemsCommand and skip the second query. Actually, I did it that way initially, and I was encountering the same error with getItemsCommand.GetString. I was afraid that perhaps the dataset was taking up too much memory and maybe that was causing the error. So I decided to try this method to see if it would help. It didnt. Does anyone know why this might be happeningp  pBy the way, ID is an INT and ITEMDESCRIPTION is a VARCHAR32000 column. If it makes any difference, the database is Borland Interbase 6.0 Ickp  pEDIT I gave the wrong line when describing where the exception was being thrown ARGH Fixed now. Also, Ive tried the things suggested so far, but they didnt help. However, I found that only very old records in the database were causing this error, which is strange. If I change the query to only pull records inserted in the last 5 years, there are no problems. Someone suggested to me this might be an encoding conversion problem or something like thatp  pbUpdateb Solved it. The problem turned out to be a bug in the ODBC driver for our notveryreliable database software. A workaround with other drivers fixed the problem.p

I would like to use that value in controller actions and in models.p  pNow, I could use TempData to pass this value from the ActionFilter to any controller action method, then distribute this value over to all models that get passed to returned views.p  pIm sure it will work but this TempData will be there in session where and when nobody actually needs it anymore. The value is supposed to be used exclusively in the code during the time of a single request after which it effectively invalidates.p  pI have come up with two optionsp  ol lipIn ActionFilter, I set this value in TempData in OnActioExecuting and I remove it in OnActionExecuted. Do I understand it correctly that by the time OnActionExecuted is called, the controller action has finished, the response has already been generated and this TempData content hasnt made its way to the session YETpli lipIn any of my custom static classes logic I just define a public property for this value and I use it whenever needed. Will this static field not be lost between OnActionExecuting and actually executing the controller method Are there any other issues with possible loosing this value during the request processing on the serverpli ol  pAre there any otherbetter options I havemt considered yetp

Negative 16163 pIm trying to make a small program that could intercept the open process of a file.p  pThe purpose is when an user doubleclick on a file in a given folder, windows would inform to the software, then it process that petition and return windows the data of the file.p  pMaybe there would be another solution like monitoring Open messages and force Windows to wait while the program prepare the contents of the file.p  pOne application of this concept, could be to manage desencryption of a file in a transparent way to the user.

Negative 16163 pIm encountering strange behavior with forms on a c 3.5 app.  On a button click, my form1 hides itself, creates a new form2, and shows form2.

Its still open and I can click it from the taskbar to show it again, but the window itself is sent behind any other open windows.  It looks like it opens up but minimizes instantly. p  pThis behavior occurs randomly.  Sometimes forms will open up and hide without a problem, but sometimes theyll lose focus over another window.  Ive tried using focus, activate, and topmost but all have failed to prevent the sudden hiding.p  pDoes anyone know why is this happening and how to fix itp  pThanks.p

Negative 16163 pBuilding a form, Im wondering if there is any significant advantage to having the query string show values in a more human readable format. p  pexample index.phpusertedamplocationnewyorkamp...and so onp  prather than index.phpuser23423amplocation34645amp... and so onp  pOn the one hand, having the query string a little more readable allows the user and search engines  to better understand where they are, but this also creates a little more work on the server side, as Ill have to track down the associated rows through something other than their unique id.  p  pi.e., first find what the id of newyork is before being able to work on other rows that require the locationid.

Negative 16163 pI am developing an app for sending some feedback.p  pBasically Im trying to make a codeTextBoxcode for comments, but Im used to the WinForms codeMultiLinetruecode.

It may be pointless if I cant easily keep the same formatting when putting this string into the email body string so that it looks like it does when sent as it does when typed.p  pCan I achieve what Im after or do I have to leave it as all text on one linep

Perhaps in presave I can retrieve the old value and stick it on the model as an attributep  pI was wondering if there was a common idiom for this. Thanks.p

Negative 16163 pI am dynamically creating a table that contains a textbox in each cell.  The table is put in a placeholder control.  Everything displays perfectly.  The problem is when I go to retrieve the values entered in the cells.  I have the code to generate the table in a separate method called CreateTable.  In order for my program to find a table in the placeholder when I go to save, I have to run CreateTable in a postback event AND in the PageLoad event.  If I call CreateTable in only one of those places and I try to save, it says the placeholder is empty and, therefore, I cannot save the textbox contents.  Ive tried calling CreateTable from InitLoad but that doesnt work because it needs to reference values from three static controls 1 dropdown, 1 listbox, and 1 calendar control, which I dont believe have had their viewstate rendered yet.  Anyone have any ideas  It would sure be nice not to have to double the number of database calls just to make this work.p

Negative 16163 pIve noticed that when I request a page in ASP.NET webforms that does not exist, the StaticFile handler deals with the error notification.p  pId like to be a bit more helpful in these situations.p  pWhat is the correct way for me to intercept this 404, and as a result, run some code to redirect the userp  pTwo ways Ive thought of doing which I currently dont really like arep  p1  Create a module that basically does a codeif file.existsurlredirect to correctedurlcodep  p2  Modify the error.aspx.csor the default error page to do something similar yuckp
Negative 16163 pI have set up several Views each containing a UIPickerView each of which contains a UIToolbar, and each of which in turn has a UIBarButtonItem.  All this is set up in IB.  I have pointers to the UIPickerViews in the code.  I am needing to reference the UIBarButtonItems as part of a function that behaves differently depending on which of the UIPickerViews it is dealing with.  I have the id sender as an argument to this function.  The sender is always one of the UIBarButtonItems.  I am trying to find which UIPickerView this particular UIBarButtonItem belongs to.  I assume that I have to start up the UIPickerView hierarchy and work down to the UIBarButtonItem.  I think this is the correct approach because I cannot do a simple compare since I have no explicit reference to the UIBarButtonItem object since it was set up in IB.  Further, because the subviews do not have a pointer to their parent view I cannot work my way back up the hierarchy.  Correct  If I am correct in my thinking to this point, do I traverse the view hierarchy in each UIPickerView, find a UIToolBar and then find a UIBarButtonItem  What exactly do I check for at both the UIToolBar level and the UIBarButtonItem level  I mean do I perform an if statement checking to see if the object is of type UIToolBar or UIBarButtonItem respectively How do I find the type of an object in an if statement   p  pA related but more general question is should I have just set this entire thing up in code so that I would have had an explicit reference to the UIBarButtonItem that I could have compared the idsender against in the first placep

Negative 16163 h1The Mysteryh1  pIn exploring precisely which characters were permitted in Java identifiers, I have stumbled upon something so extremely curious that it seems nearly certain to be a bug. p  pId expected to find that Java identifiers conformed to the requirement that they start with characters that have the Unicode property codeIDStartcode and are followed by those with the property codeIDContinuecode, with an exception granted for leading underscores and for dollar signs. That did not prove to be the case, and what I found is at extreme variance with that or any other idea of a normal identifier that I have heard of.p  h1Short Demoh1  pConsider the following demonstration proving that an ASCII ESC character octal 033 is permitted in Java identifiersp  precode perl le print qqpublic class escape  public static void mainString argv[]  String var033  i am escape 033 System.out.printlnvar033  gt escape.java  javac escape.java  java escape  cat v i am escape [ codepre  pIts even worse than that, though.  Almost infinitely worse, in fact.  Even NULLs are permitted And thousands of other code points that are not even identifier characters. I have tested this on Solaris, Linux, and a Mac running Darwin, and all give the same results.p  h1Long Demoh1  pHere is a test program that will show all these unexpected code points that Java quite outrageuosly allows as part of a legal identifier name.p  precodeusrbinenv perl    testjavaidchars  find which bogus code points Java allows in its identifiers      usage testjavaidchars [low high]    e.g.  testjavaidchars 0 255   Without arguments, tests Unicode code points  from 0 .. 0x1000.

Negative 16163 pIm just starting my first fairly large Qt project which will be mostly a bunch of screens with buttons, tab widgets, and Qwt Plots. The panel stack pattern described in a hrefhttpdoc.trolltech.comqqqq27panelstack.html relnofollowQt Quarterly 27a seems pretty nice for my application. Each of my screens is a QWidget encapsulated in a Panel which is shownhidden by a QStackedWidget. However it uses a strongsingleton patternstrong for each Panel so that they arent all created immediately as the app starts and so that more than one of each screen isnt ever created. p  pSo I started coding. Got the panel stack working. Added some code so that dynamically updating widgets arent dynamically updating all the time. Got my history stackback button working for the panels. Everything seems just fine, but Ive got one nagging worryp  ol liMy code smells.li ol  pI am in no place to argue with any of the hate posted here and on blogs about the singleton pattern. I think I get it and the code Ive written does make me feel a bit dirty with all the boilerplate lines and global objects. But I do like not having to worry about whether or not I already instantiated a screen before switching to it and adding it to my history stack. I just say switch to that screen, its added to my history stack, and the magic works.p  pFrom what Ive read there are also some cases where singletons can be worthwhile. Is this one of those special cases The magic screen switching  history stack makes me think yes but the sheer number of different singleton classes Im going to have to create makes me think NO no NO NO NO.p  pI want to just man up and figure out how to get the singleton pattern out of my code strongnowstrong so that I dont have to do it later. But I dont want to get rid of all my singleton classes just to get rid of my singleton classes because theyre EVIL [citation needed].p  pAny input is much appreciatedp

However, each polaroid has a button on it, which opens additional info. But because the scrollView eats all the clicks, the button on the polaroid never gets any events.p  pWhat is the appropriate way to route clicks event out of the scrollView into my stackView UIView p

Negative 16163 pRepository pattern is used to abstract from particular database and objectrelationmapping technologylike EF used. So I can easily replace for example my Entity framework mappings with Linq to SQL in the future if I decide to do so.p  pBut when I use EF I have my entity classes from the model  that is they are generated from that visual diagram. If I use this generated entity classes in my repository and then decide to replace EF by something else then I will delete that visual entity diagram and that means also to delete classes right p  pThe point Im addressing is that my repository will be dependent on Entity framework, that is on data access layer because it will use classes generated by EF.p  pHow do I remove this dependency p  pAlso note that I use EF primarily because of its ability to generate everything from that visual diagram  I just design the diagram and let it generate database for me with all the foreign keys etc. I like that very much and dont want to even think about SQL commands.p

Negative 16163 pIve read many of the UIScrollView questions asked on here but none of them answered this problem.p  pI have a UIScrollView that zooms a view containing other subviews. When a zoom is happening, I need to have the subviews of the view move to certain places. I can accomplish this by changing their frames accordingly in the layoutSubviews method of the UIScrollView.p  pOn iOS 3.2 and lower, this works great both for fingerzooming and pragmatic zooming using zoomToRectanimated method.p  pOn iOS 4.0 or higher, this only works great for fingerzooming. With pragmatic zooming using zoomToRectanimated, a call to layoutSubviews only happens once at the end of the zoom. I need this method to get called many times during the duration of the zoom so that my subviews can have smooth position changes along with the zoom.p  pSo in summary, on iOS 3.2, a call to layoutSubviews happens many times and on iOS 4.0 a call to layoutSubviews happens only once when you call zoomToRectanimated. Does anyone know of a solution to my problemp

Negative 16163 pIve been busily implementing JQuery throughout our custom CRM at work. In the process I create a bordered panel, which has the a simple button in its header which collapses or expands the contents depending on what its current state is. Now to remember the state of the panel Im using the jquery cookie library, which when the page is submitted sets a cookie for that control, and then when the page is reloaded it reads and resets the panel to its last state.p  pProblem one was getting JQuery to execute on the submit of the page, because ASP.NET takes over this and wouldnt call the submit functions on the form. To overcome this, I found a hrefhttpkenbrowning.blogspot.com200901supportingjquerysformsubmitinaspnet.html relnofollowhttpkenbrowning.blogspot.com200901supportingjquerysformsubmitinaspnet.htmla which seemed to work almost flawlessly.p  pHowever... After further testing, Ive discovered that this will prevent any postbacks that are meant to occur within an UpdatePanel, to do a full Postback, instead of Async one from the panel. I realise UpdatePanels are a little outdated now, but they are littered throughout our site, so in order to use this control it will have to work nicely with them.p  pSo, is there anyway of determining if an async postback has taken place Basically I want to be able to do something like thisp  precodeif IsAsyncPostback      theForm.submit this seems to still fire the async postback, but doesnt call the jquery which is setup to save the state..  else      theForm.submit this is from the link, which cause all postbacks to be full on postbacks, even if they are in an updatepanel  codepre  pHelp, Ive searched around and havent been able to find anything useful.. Sure I cant be the only person who has tried thisp

Negative 16163 h2Problem Backgroundh2  pGenerating and accessing data of a fixed column layout is easy.  You can create local temp tables upfront, and populate them by calling stored procedures.p  pOn the other hand, if you want to generate data with a dynamic column layout, you must generally build an SQL statement dynamically and execute it with exec spexecutesql.  Since the data layout is unknown at runtime, you cannot create a temptable upfront, and once inside the exec spexecutesql statement, any temporary tables created there are bound to that scope and vanish when the call returns, so its much more difficult to access the data i.e. your options are more limited.p  h2My Specific Situationh2  pI have a query that needs to access data in a dynamically generated table.p  pThe table is generated by a stored procedure, which dynamically builds a query, stores it in a variable sql nvarcharmax, and runs it by calling  exec spexecutesql statement  sql.p  pThe sql statement was something like select  into temptable from..., but temptable was destroyed by the time exec spexecutesql returned.  A quick fix for this was to just use temptable instead i.e. a global temp table, because it survives when the stored procedure returns AND I can easily access it in the calling scope because it has a knownstatic name.p  pI dont like this solution because global temp tables arent threadsafe name collistionwise, and I dont want to have to mess with dynamicallygenerated unique names, because Ill just end up having to use more dynamic SQL to access them... which puts me right back at square one, leaving the data inaccessible outside the SP.p  pI dont think returning table variables through output parameters is an option new to SQL Server 2008 too, unless it can be done without having to define a static table type.  The tables my stored procedure generates are dynamic, and depend on the input parameters passed.p  pInline tablevalued functions are not an option, because Im running code loops to build the sql query and calling exec spexecutesql.p  pMultistatement tablevalued functions instead of the stored procedure, is also not an option, because such a function must have a welldefined table format, whereas Im running dyanmic SQL to return a table with a variable number of columns and column names depending on the input parameter values.p  pAll I really want to do is select the result set of the dynamic query into a new table, but Im finding it difficult, as none of the above works particularly irritating is how local temporary tables arent local to the session, but local to the stored procedure so that they vanish upon returning.  The only a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions653714howtoselectintotemptablefromstoredproceduresolutiona Ive seen insists that using OPENROWSET is the only way, but I dont want to mess with connection strings inside my stored procedure, for the same reason I dont want to include uniquenamemanagement code... its just way more complicated than it ought to be.p  pIn summary, I just want to execute dynamic SQL that generates a dataset of an unknown format, and be able to easily access it from the calling scope.p

Negative 16163 pI think Ill soon will regret the day I chose to use InstallShield and not WiX.p  pI had a bit of experience with WiX, and it seemed a bit complicated to use, so when the time came for a real project, I chose to use the new Flexera InstallShield LE for Visual Studio 2010.  At first it seemed so easy, I created and compiled the first installation project without any issues. It even managed to extract COM information from some 3rd party library which was compiled using VC 6, as far as I know.p  pBut when I added some more InstallShield installation ISL projects to the same solution, strange problems appeared. If I edit the General information page of one ISL project and then click Save All button, suddenly the information gets messed up with parts from other ISL projects, some fields show up as UNITITIALIZED STRING, and some fields just mix up. And when I open the other ISL projects, I see, that the info is messed up there, too. The only solution seems to be to unload all other ISL projects while editing the General information page.p  pThe problem number two crashes. My project is a mixed CC application. Sometimes while editing unmanaged C code, Visual Studio just crashes on some certain operations like commenting out some blocks of code, cutting, pasting. I even installed Visual Studio 2010 SP1, but that did not help. The crashes completely stopped occurring when I unloaded all ISL projects.p  pAnyway, I am frustrated and now I have a choice p  ul lipstay with ISL, create my own executable which will get installed and will run regsvr32. Still Ill have to live with Visual Studio crashes and General Information page problems.pli lipmove to Windows Installer XML. But I am not sure at what stage it is now, wont I have the same problems Can WiX register COMs for me also can it register 32 bit dlls on 64 bit systems using regsvr32 from syswow64 folder Is it stable with Visual Studio 2010pli ul  pI will really appreciate your suggestions about what should I do  stay with ISL or move to WiX, especially from those who are experienced WiX users on Visual Studio 2010.p

Negative 16163 pI have a question here that looks a little like some of the ones that I found in search, but with solutions for slightly different problems and, importantly, ones that dont work in SQL 2000.p  pI have a very large table with a lot of redundant data that I am trying to reduce down to just the useful entries. Its a history table, and the way it works, if two entries are essentially duplicates and consecutive when sorted by date, the latter can be deleted. The data from the earlier entry will be used when historical data is requested from a date between the effective date of that entry and the next nonduplicate entry.p  pThe data looks something like thisp  precodeid     userid effectivedate importantvalue uselessvalue 1      1       132007       3               0 2      1       142007       3               1 3      1       162007       NULL            1 4      1       212007       3               0 5      2       152007       12              1 6      3       111899       7               0 codepre  pWith this sample set, we would consider two consecutive rows duplicates if the codeuseridcode and the codeimportantvaluecode are the same. From this sample set, we would only delete row with codeidcode2, preserving the information from 132007, showing that the codeimportantvaluecode changed on 162007, and then showing the relevant change again on 212007.p  pMy current approach is awkward and timeconsuming, and I know there must be a better way. I wrote a script that uses a cursor to iterate through the codeuseridcode values since that breaks the huge table up into manageable pieces, and creates a temp table of just the rows for that user. Then to get consecutive entries, it takes the temp table, joins it to itself on the condition that there are no other entries in the temp table with a date between the two dates. In the pseudocode below, codeUDFSameOrNullcode is a function that returns 1 if the two values passed in are the same or if they are both NULL.p  precodeWHILE fetchstatus ltgt 1 BEGIN   SELECT  FROM History INTO history WHERE userid  UserId    return entries to delete   SELECT h2.id   INTO deletehistoryids   FROM history h1   JOIN history h2 ON     h1.effectivedate lt h2.effectivedate     AND dbo.UDFSameOrNullh1.importantvalue, h2.importantvalue1   WHERE NOT EXISTS SELECT 1 FROM history hx WHERE hx.effectivedate gt h1.effectivedate and hx.effectivedate lt h2.effectivedate    DELETE h1   FROM History h1   JOIN deletehistoryids dh ON     h1.id  dh.id     FETCH NEXT FROM UserCursor INTO UserId END  codepre  pIt also loops over the same set of duplicates until there are none, since taking out rows creates new consecutive pairs that are potentially dupes. I left that out for simplicity.p  pUnfortunately, I must use SQL Server 2000 for this task and I am pretty sure that it does not support ROWNUMBER for a more elegant way to find consecutive entries.p  pThanks for reading. I apologize for any unnecessary backstory or errors in the pseudocode.p

However, it seems to me that the authorization issues are part of the business logic, and therefore should be in the model. Furthermore, Im starting to see duplicated logic in the controllers that I need to refactor out.p  pOn the other hand, adding authorization to the model means that Id have to have some way of getting the current user from within the model, which doesnt seem right. Alternatively, I could add a currentuser parameter to every model method, but that seems even worse.p  pSo what is the common practice Canshould I put authorization code in the model, or keep it in the controllerp

Negative 16163 pIn Bjarne Stroustrups book The C Programming Language, it is stated that a derived class from a super class in a class hierarchy, in many case, gets access to the data of the super class. The book suggests this is a problem, because the sharing between emtwo related, but different, sets of data is asking for trouble. Sooner or later someone will get them out of sync. Also, experience shows that novice programmers tend to mess with protected data in ways that are unnecessary and that cause maintenance problemsem. The question here is, stronghow can having access to private data from the ancestor class is asking for troublestrong It sounds like having inherited assets from your parent is a bad deal.p  pAs a consequence, the pure abstract class mechanism allows the separation between the abstract class and its implementation. Note that the implementation includes data members, because if the data members are defined in an abstract class, the abstract class contains implementation details the defined members, thus it is not well decoupled between abstraction and the implementation. Why is such separation needed One of the reason, as stated in a hrefhttpen.wikibooks.orgwikiCProgrammingClassesAbstractClassesPureAbstractClasses relnofollowherea, is ema way of forcing a contract between the class designer and the users of that class. The users of this class must declare a matching member function for the class to compile.em Another important reason, as stated in the book, is to protect against changes from the implementation. Having an abstract class hierarchy, you can protect against the changes which requires compilation of an entire class hierarchy. p  pFor example, if you have a normal class, and the class contains 10 data members and 20 member functions, and is inherited by a dozen of classes with several layers below the root class. A few changes to the implementation of member functions function signature remains unchanged of the root class, and you have to recompile the entire class hierarchy to apply changes its terminal classes, otherwise the program breaks. With abstract class hierarchy, unless the function signature is changed, if an implementation of a terminal class changes, only that terminal class needs to be recompiled. Therefore, most of the code are protected to the maximum. strongIs my understanding correctstrong p  pI think his example the strongIvalboxstrong example in combination with the Bridge Design Pattern tries, and is powerful, since Bridge Pattern leaves the abstract tree completely, and have another class hierarchy for implementation. strongPure abstract classstrong can be consider equivalent to strongInterfacestrong in Java, except in Java the explanation usually is the abstract class can be inherited once, while interface allow multiple inheritances, thus having shared behaviors encapsulated in a shared interface between multiple classes. That answer, I think, is not valid in this context, since C allows multiple inheritance.p  pThe last question is, stronghow is a derived class compiled and exist in the binary imagestrong Does the compiler fill the inherited information into the derived class, considered it to be an isolated class afterward and then compiled Similar to preprocessingp  pstrongtldrstrongp  pstrongHow can having access to private data from the ancestor class is asking for troublestrongp  pstrongIs pure abstract class aka Interface in Java a way to protect source code against changes, with the separation of abstraction tree and implementation treestrongp  pstrongHow is abstract classsuper class compiled in C Does it turn the derived class into a single class by filling in the information from superclass, then compilesstrongp

Negative 16163 pHere is my scenario,p  pI am looking at solutions like Good for Government, which allows a government agency to restrict access to system applications in iOS and Android via a web serverenterprise solution. This is what they describe their solution doesp  blockquote   pHelpdesk personnel can quickly troubleshoot  issues, with complete   visibility into all iOS devices  deployed within the agency. To   protect agency  data, you can enforce policies, such as requiring    passwords and preventing cutcopypaste from  the Good app. You can   also block unapproved  applications such as YouTube, the Safari   browser,  camera, or the App Store.  In the event the  device is lost   or stolen, you can remotewipe  agency data.  Selfservice   capabilities allow you  to empower employees with basic tasks, such as   adding devices or remote wiping their own devices.p blockquote  pIs this at all possible to recreate Of course for a different purpose, but if I could restrict access to certain system applications with a set code, and only to be unblocked again by a qualified person within a data centerp  pIf someone could point me in the right direction to be able to do such things with iOS, and Android if possible as well, it would be more than appreciated.p

Negative 16163 pIm developing a backup tool and I cant figure out the most efficient way to do remote backup. I dont want to send the whole file every time theres a small change so I guess incremental backup is the solution. This is all well and good but now Im stuck with a problem that how can I chunk one file into multiple parts.p  pThe problem is that lets say I have a simple text file and one chunk is one linep  precodeFirst line Second line Third line Fourth line codepre  pNow I have 4 chunks. If I update the second line to lets say THE second line, now I only need to backup the second chunk.p  pBut what if something like this happensp  precodeFirst line First and half line Second line Third line Fourth line codepre  pNow that I added First and half line, every line is now in a different place. So if each line is one chunk, it looks like that every chunk after the first has changed even the content is the same.p  pIs there any simple solution for this First I thought that I could do hash of each chunk and then just create catalog that would indicate the correct chunk order. This way I could match easily if the chunk exists already with the hash. However I realized that hash table solution wouldnt work with anything else than with files where chunks can be predicted and fixed. For example with binary files you are pretty much limited with fixed byte sized chunks so if there was more data added in the beginning and you started chopping it down to lets say 100k chunks, you would get different data in the later chunks than before.p  pAny solutionsp

Negative 16163 pI wrote my first VB WPF application recently to do some automated tasks with Quickbooks.  It was a bit of a challenge because I had no prior experience with VB or Quickbooks.  Among other things, I didnt understand the threading model and the problems I may encounter in the process.  I basically wrote the entire application in 1 thread...the UI thread.  Ive come to understand that, while this works, it creates problems with longrunning tasks that halt the UI thread.  I started looking into multithreading and have now run into problems because Im using UI bound strongObservableCollectionsstrong, which dont natively support updating the OC on a secondary thread.  I found a number of posts on the topic, like a hrefhttplambert.geek.nz20071030wpfmultithreadedcollections relnofollowthis onea from Mirality, and I will be looking into those next.p  pBefore I undertake a massive rewrite of the whole application, Im hoping theres an easier way to do what Im trying to do.  The ONLY reason I want to look at multithreading is because I would like to show a Loading... window with or without taskspecific messages i.e. Getting all vendors from Quickbooks..., etc, depending on whats easier.  If there were a simple way to do a quick task switch to update the UI thread before continuing on with the other tasks that would probably solve my problem, but I dont know how to do that.p  pHeres a simple example to illustrate the problem.  I have a custom application class that performs startup tasks in the strongAppStartupstrong method.p  precodePartial Public Class MyApp     Inherits System.Windows.Application      Private qbclient As QBClient     Private vendorListWindow As VendorListWindow     Private splashScreen As StartupSplash              AppStartup Method            Initialize the application          Public Sub AppStartup         vendorListWindow  New VendorListWindow         vendorListWindow.IsEnabled  False          splashScreen  New StartupSplash         splashScreen.Owner  vendorListWindow         splashScreen.Show          splashScreen.progressMessage.Content  Downloading all items from Quickbooks...         Me.GetQBClient.GetAllItems          splashScreen.progressMessage.Content  Downloading all vendors from Quickbooks...         Me.GetQBClient.GetAllVendors          splashScreen.progressMessage.Content  Locating vendors with items...         Me.GetQBClient.FlagVendorsWithItems          splashScreen.progressMessage.Content  Adding list filters...         vendorListWindow.AddListFilters          splashScreen.Close         vendorListWindow.Show         vendorListWindow.IsEnabled  True      End Sub End Class codepre  pIn the above example, the strongStartupSplashstrong is just a basic window with no framing that I use for a startup splash screen.  At other times in the application I have another basic Loading window that essentially does the same thing but looks slightly different.p  pIn either case, I see the splash screen but the content of the emprogressMessageem text block never updates.  Obviously, this is due to the fact that the UI thread is busy with the tasks Ive asked it to do.  In all cases, I return from a longrunning task before calling the next, so there is ample time to push an update to the UI and then move on.  Is this even possible or do I have to undertake the arduous task of multithreading my applicationp  pThanksp

Negative 16163 pIm developing a small game with pyglet. One centerpiece is, of course, drawing coloured rectangels. I initially did this by creating images in memory and codeblitcodeing them, which worked fine. After noticing how ugly, roundabout and inefficent yes, I profiled  codeColorRect.drawcode took significant time and became 10x more efficent through this change this is, Ive started creating vertex lists instead, via codepyglet.graphics.Batchcode I copied most of the code verbatim from one of the examples.

As the error occurs somewhere deep in the event loop, I cannot easily track down which position update causes it. Honestly, Im stumped. Thus Ill braindump what I have found out and hope for some kind psychic.p  pIve tried it out on Windows 7 32 bit I may get around to try it on Ubuntu 11.10 soon with Python 3.2.2, with a pyglet revision 043180b64260 pulled from Goggle Code and built from source, the 1.1.4 release is harder to install as it doesnt run 2to3 automatically, though it appears to be equally py3kready.

Negative 16163 pIm working on a species ID app and would like to populate a layer with sprites based on which animal you select on the main layer. Ive made each animal a menu item, and can get my info layer to appear when pressing the button, but how can I set it up so the layer shows the right data depending on which animal you select The info layer is not a full screen layer, but rather an overlaying layer that only fills about 75 of the screen, which is why Im going with a layer rather than a scene. I know I can create a new layer for each animal approx 50 and code it so each button calls its own layer, but I think populating based on which button is pressed would make for cleaner code.

Negative 16163 pI am starting to design an application which primarily does XML transformation from one format to the other. The user provides the input XML and tells the application what type it is and what is the type of output XML heshe wants and the application then converts the input xml to output xml. I wanted to ask if there is a good framework preferably Java based which does that. I am thinking of using XSLT with custom actions but if someone can suggest an existing framework which already does provide all the scaffolding then I will save time.  I am about to explore Smooks. One problem with XSLT which someone mentioned was that it might not be able to handle huge files  50mb or so without loading it all in memory. Is that true Also the input format might sometimes not be XML..could be text file hence I should be able to add other transformers. Ofcourse I understand the  framework would just be that  a framework I will be providing the actual conversion code. But would love to hear from experts out there  Thanks vp

Negative 16163 pstrongTaskstrong Im using static classes, so everyone shares data thats been already loaded. If someone makes a change, that request will put an item in a list with an incremental ID, and my idea would be that every client has its version on client side and requests if theres any change.p  pstrongMy solutionstrong For this I use a .post with a timeout of 5000ms and sending the client version, on server side I have a 500 cycle for loop which checks if theres something newer and breaks the loop, returns the changes and have a 10ms Thread.Sleep in every cycle so it wouldnt hog the cpu. Either if on the client it times out, has an error, I call the post again, if it succeeds I process the return data, than call the post again. This way I always should get the changes almost instantly without an overwhelming number of requests, and if something fails, I only need to wait 5secs for it to resume.p  pstrongMy problemstrong is that when this loop runs, other requests arent handled. With asp.net development server, thats okay, because its single threaded. But thats also the case with win7hp iis7.5.p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong Set it in the registry HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftASP.NET4.0.30319.0MaxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU, increasing the worker threads for the application pool, updating the aspnet.config file with  maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU12 maxConcurrentThreadsPerCPU0 requestQueueLimit5000 settings, and I also read that my win7hp should be able to use 3 threads. I also thought its an optimization, that I use same variables in one request so it queues the others, so I commented those lines, left the for loop with the sleep only, but same result.p

I was thinking this could be a pre main XSLT step and then pass the output onto the main XSLT.p  pstrongSample Schema Instrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt     ltxselement namettPTManifestgt         ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxssequencegt                 ltxselement refJobCodegt                 ltxselement refEstimateHoursgt                 ltxselement refActualHoursgt                 ltxselement refDensitygt                 ltxselement refNettLitresgt                 ltxselement refQuitOutLitresgt                 ltxselement refQuitInLitresgt             ltxssequencegt         ltxscomplexTypegt     ltxselementgt     ltxselement nameQuitOutLitres typexsdoublegt     ltxselement nameQuitInLitres typexsfloatgt     ltxselement namePTManifestSonicIngt         ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxssequencegt                 ltxselement refttPTManifestgt             ltxssequencegt         ltxscomplexTypegt     ltxselementgt     ltxselement nameJobCode typexsstringgt     ltxselement nameNettLitres typexsdoublegt     ltxselement nameEstimateHours typexsfloatgt     ltxselement nameDensity typexsdecimalgt     ltxselement nameActualHours typexsfloatgt ltxsschemagt codepre  pstrongSample XML Data Instrongp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltPTManifestSonicIn xsinoNamespaceSchemaLocationSampleIn.xsd xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt     ltttPTManifestgt         ltJobCodegt000123ltJobCodegt         ltEstimateHoursgt3.14159E3ltEstimateHoursgt         ltActualHoursgt3.14159E3ltActualHoursgt         ltDensitygt123.456ltDensitygt         ltNettLitresgt3.14159265358979E3ltNettLitresgt         ltQuitOutLitresgt3.14159265358979E3ltQuitOutLitresgt         ltQuitInLitresgt3.14159E3ltQuitInLitresgt     ltttPTManifestgt ltPTManifestSonicIngt codepre  pstrongRerquired Schema Outstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt     ltxselement namettPTManifestgt         ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxssequencegt                 ltxselement refJobCodegt                 ltxselement refEstimateHoursgt                 ltxselement refActualHoursgt                 ltxselement refDensitygt                 ltxselement refNettLitresgt                 ltxselement refQuitOutLitresgt                 ltxselement refQuitInLitresgt             ltxssequencegt         ltxscomplexTypegt     ltxselementgt     ltxselement nameQuitOutLitres typexsdecimalgt     ltxselement nameQuitInLitres typexsdecimalgt     ltxselement namePTManifestSonicIngt         ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxssequencegt                 ltxselement refttPTManifestgt             ltxssequencegt         ltxscomplexTypegt     ltxselementgt     ltxselement nameJobCode typexsstringgt     ltxselement nameNettLitres typexsdecimalgt     ltxselement nameEstimateHours typexsdecimalgt     ltxselement nameDensity typexsdecimalgt     ltxselement nameActualHours typexsdecimalgt ltxsschemagt codepre  pstrongRequired XML Data Outstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltPTManifestSonicIn xsinoNamespaceSchemaLocationSampleOut.xsd xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt     ltttPTManifestgt         ltJobCodegt000123ltJobCodegt         ltEstimateHoursgt3141.59ltEstimateHoursgt         ltActualHoursgt3141.59ltActualHoursgt         ltDensitygt123.456ltDensitygt         ltNettLitresgt3141.59265358979ltNettLitresgt         ltQuitOutLitresgt3141.59265358979ltQuitOutLitresgt         ltQuitInLitresgt3141.59ltQuitInLitresgt     ltttPTManifestgt ltPTManifestSonicIngt codepre

Since the codeselectcode element has an codeoptionsCaptioncode binding, here is what I believe is happeningp  ol liThe data ajax call completes, setting the codevalueObservablecode to some value like 6, abc, or some other nonfalsy value. li liBecause there is only 1 codeoptioncode in the codeselectcode element due to the codeoptionsCaptioncode, and because the codevalueObservablecode is bound to it via the codevaluecode binding, this causes the codevalueObservablecode to be changed to codeundefinedcode.li liFinally, the codeoptionsObservableArraycode completes and adds new codeoptioncode elements to the codeselectcode, but by this time it is too late The codevalueObservablecode is now wrapping an codeundefinedcode value rather than the real data value returned from the first ajax call.li ol  pQuestion What is the best way to work around this Here is what I can think ofp  ol liMake the first ajax call run with codeasync falsecode. This may slow page rendering.li liCreate a separate observable for binding to the select value such as codevalue selectedValueObservablecode. Then subscribe to the codeoptionsObservableArraycode and use the subscription to do something like codeself.selectedValueObservableself.valueObservablecode. This seems like a bandaid fix.li liRender the select amp options to the page before any javascript executes by sending the options data from the server using MVC viewmodel. This makes it a little more difficult to deal with the options as an codeobservableArraycode.li ol  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThere is another concern which I omitted from this question to simplify the example code. In actuality, this viewmodel is used to create an editable list of data items. So there is actually more than 1 dropdown list that gets rendered to the page. The data ajax call really returns an array, and its success function really sets an codeobservableArraycode of complex items. Since the dropdown list options are reused in every inline form, it is placed on the codeparentcode viewmodel and only loaded once. It is also difficult to pass the select options in a single ajax call because the data items are retrieved via WebAPI which returns an codeIEnumerablecode, no room to send additional dropdown options. p

Negative 16163 pI have a realworld problem which Ill try to abstract into an illustrative example.p  pSo imagine I have data objects in a tree, where parent objects can access children, and children can access parentsp  precode Interfaces interface IParentltTChildgt  ListltTChildgt Children  interface IChildltTParentgt  TParent Parent    Classes class Top  IParentltMiddlegt  class Middle  IParentltBottomgt, IChildltTopgt  class Bottom  IChildltMiddlegt    Usage var top  new Top var middles  top.Children  ListltMiddlegt foreach var middle in middles      var bottoms  middle.Children  ListltBottomgt     foreach var bottom in bottoms          var middle  bottom.Parent  Access the parent         var top  middle.Parent  Access the grandparent       codepre  pAll three data objects have properties that are persisted in two data stores e.g. a database and a web service, and they need to reflect and synchronise with the stores. Some objects only request from the web service, some only write to it.p  pstrongData Mapperstrongp  pMy favourite pattern for data access is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd569757.aspxid0400052 relnofollowData Mappera, because it completely separates the data objects themselves from the communication with the data storep  precodeclass TopMapper      public Top FetchByIdint id          var top  new TopDataStore.TopDataByIdid         top.Children  MiddleMapper.FetchForTopTop         return Top        class MiddleMapper      public Middle FetchByIdint id           var middle  new MiddleDataStore.MiddleDataByIdid          middle.Parent  TopMapper.FetchForMiddlemiddle          middle.Children  BottomMapper.FetchForMiddlebottom          return middle       codepre  pThis way I can have one mapper per data store, and build the object from the mapper I want, and then save it back using the mapper I want.p  pThere is a circular reference here, but I guess thats not a problem because most languages can just store memory references to the objects, so there wont actually be infinite data.p  pThe problem with this is that every time I want to construct a new codeTopcode, codeMiddlecode or codeBottomcode, it needs to build the entire object tree within that objects codeParentcode or codeChildrencode property, with all the data store requests and memory usage that that entails. And in real life my tree is much bigger than the one represented here, so thats a problem.p  pstrongRequests in the objectstrongp  pIn this the objects request their codeParentcodes and codeChildrencode themselvesp  precodeclass Middle      private ListltBottomgt children  null  cache     public ListltBottomgt Children          get              children  children  BottomMapper.FetchForMiddlethis             return children                  set              BottomMapper.UpdateForMiddlethis, value             children  value                codepre  pI think this is an example of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd569757.aspxid0400058 relnofollowrepository patterna. Is that correctp  pThis solution seems neat  the data only gets requested from the data store when you need it, and thereafter its stored in the object if you want to request it again, avoiding a further request.p  pHowever, I have two different data sources. Theres a database, but theres also a web service, and I need to be able to create an object from the web service and save it back to the database and then request it again from the database and update the web service.p  pThis also makes me uneasy because the data objects themselves are no longer ignorant of the data source. Weve introduced a new dependency, not to mention a circular dependency, making it harder to test. And the objects now mask their communication with the database.p  pstrongOther solutionsstrongp  pAre there any other solutions which could take care of the multiple stores problem but also mean that I dont need to build  request all the data every timep

So here we go p  pI am essentially looking for a Responsive CSS library which is flexible or tweakable on the widthpaddingmargins of different elements. Most of the responsive libraries out their requires that website needs to be of say 1440px or 960px wide and then they give Npx of paddingmargins to different containers. At the end, I know that no matter which library I choose, its CSS needs to be modified for my design. So is BootStrap easily tweakable or should I go for some other libraryp  pThanks, Jagsp

Negative 16163 pMy understanding of interfaces is that they cannot contain method definitions, only signatures and constant declarations. I have an arraylist that contains a collection of interface objects. In this case, it looks like p  pListlt StoreItem  items  new ArrayListlt StoreItem p  pand StoreItem is my interface that looks like thisp  precodepublic interface StoreItem  Operations public String getMaker public Patron getItemBuyer public Date getManufactureDate public String getManufacturer public String getProductName public void setItemBuyerPatron purchase      codepre  pI have a method to create a new item and add it to the list. It seems to work ok, in that Im not getting any problems on the unit test and no exceptions are caught. However I have that classic newbie problem where I want to print the arraylist to see the contents with my own eyes, and I understand I need to override the toString method for StoreItem. But StoreItem is an interface and obviously it wont let me do anything like this within the Interface. I also have an abstract class implementing this interface, and three subclasses of that abstract class. I am creating an object of one of these subclasses as the StoreItem, so I tried to do a toString override within this subclass. I cant get this to work. I triedp  precodepublic String toString     return super.productName  codepre  pWhich it didnt like, because within the abstract super class productName is private, and needs to be for the sake of the project. I decided to go ahead and change productName to protected anyway just to see if it would still work. I still just get the memory location something like d9sdf83j when printing the list. So I set it back to private and tried to have the toString use the getter method from the superclass on the return, sop  precodepublic String toString     return super.getProductName  codepre  pI still just get the memory location. I dont know if this is enough code to portray whats going on and what Im trying to do. Im hoping the error is rudimentary enough that someone wiser than me can just spot it and point it out, but I can add more code if necessary. Thanks in advance.p  pI still cant get it to work.

Negative 16163 pIve set up Flurry ads in my app and most of the time, they work great. My game has several minigames, and at the end of each minigame, I show an ad. p  pHowever, occasionally the ad does not appear, leaving the user hanging on the games end screen. I cant figure out a use case whereby this happens every time, rather it seems to occur randomly. p  pOnce the ad has failed to appear, double tapping the home button i.e. bringing up the app switcher menu has the effect of dismissing the ad, and returning to my games main screen. So its as if the ad is there, but the user cant see it or click x to dismiss it. p  pAfter this happens once, it happens emeveryem time, i.e. the app doesnt return to a state where  ads work, emunlessem I reboot the app completely double tapping the home button etc.p  pI get many reports from my users of the app crashing after every minigame, whereas what is actually happening is that the ad is failing to appear. p  pBelow is my code to initialise and display the ads.

Negative 16163 pSolution Foundp  pProblem description I was using an old C library and had a class that was receiving a const char  as an argument in a function. The function was creating a dynamic object and storing it in a linked list using the const char  as an argument.p  pThe problem was that after doing so, the const char  that was passed to the function was modified in memory outside of the class. This destroyed the data in the Node.p  pThe Solution Use stdstring as the data types in the Classes. When the const char  is passed to the string as a value the string takes care of the memory management for you.p  pWhat I learned When using C always use Strings and ONLY use char  with a string.cstr if it is needed in some C library.p  pThanks guys.

The admin will then assign timeslots that represent between what hours the room will be available and what days of the week it will be available.p  pThe users will fill out their basic information and fill out a form representing what times they are available.p  pAfter all the users have registered the admin will run a scheduling algorithm to come up with the closest to a most efficient schedule that it can because its NP hard.p  pThe assigned relation represents user time slots that are related to room time slots in order to produce a table of what users are assigned to what rooms at what times.p  pIm using Visual Studio 2012.p  pbQuestionsbp  ol liHow would I represent these aggregate entities using CodeFirst Not necessarily asking for the code for this exact diagram but maybe quick example to help me wrap my head around CodeFirst.li liDo my mappings look correct for these relationsli ol  pAny help or point in the right direction is greatly appreciated Thank youp  pBelow is an ER diagram that represents the followingp  ul liRoom id, number, building, capacityli liTimeSlot id, startHour, endHour, dayOfWeekli liUser id, firstName, lastName, emailli liAvailable userId, timeIDli liReserved roomID, timeIDli liAssigned reservedID, availableIDli ul  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comDB5USEx.png altER Diagramp

Negative 16163 pI keep searching for this online with no answer. I understand that web development you worry about the front end HTML, CSS, javascript and the backend PHP, JSP, ASP.NET, etc. All of these use different languages, technology, development environment. My question then is do ASP.NET MVC provide a single IDE visual studio and one languagesyntax to worry about C If so, is there an open source comparison to this If not, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using proprietary technology from microsoft ie. licenses, expensesp  hr  pSo if there is no single language even when using a framework, is it just one IDE like visual studio is that an advantage in itself Do you have the same for PHP Cake and other frameworksp

Negative 16163 pI have a question regarding the quality of the drawString function, currently I have this image img srchttpimg541.imageshack.usimg5414529tcg4.jpg altexamplep  pBasically what you see in the bottom middle is a card drawn on 125 of its size. The cards in the background are relatively 50 and 25 size.p  pHowever what I noticed is that the quality fo the text in the description box is not as good as it should be.

Negative 16163 pIm looking for a programmatic way to get the version number of a driver. I want the same number that device manager shows in the driver properties for a device.p  pBackground I have an application that talks to some custom hardware. The device driver for the custom hardware has known bugs before a certain version number. I want the application to check the driver version and warn the user if they need to update it. The application runs on Windows XP and 7 and is written in C.p  pA previous hack I used was to read the .sys file directly from system32drivers and search for FileVersion directly. This is bad for many reasons. In particular it seems to need admin privileges on Windows 7.p  pI know the class GUID and the hardware ID ie USBVID1234ampPID5678.p  pThe application currently uses SetupDiGetClassDevs, SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces and then SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail to get the DevicePath. It then calls CreateFile with that path to talk to the driver.p  pIt looks like I need to get a SPDRVINFODATA structure from somewhere.

Negative 16163 pImagine I have the following structurep  precodeDECLARE Products TABLE      MemberId INT,     ProductId INT,     GlobalProductId INT,     PRIMARY KEY MemberId, ProductId INSERT INTO Products VALUES 1, 1, NULLthis is my global product INSERT INTO Products VALUES 2, 1, NULLthis is okay INSERT INTO Products VALUES 2, 2, 1this is okay INSERT INTO Products VALUES 2, 3, 2this should fail SELECT  FROM Products codepre  pThe rule I want to enforce is that MemberId  1 holds global products and all other MemberIds hold normal products.  A set of normal products can be linked to a single global product.p  pSo I want the ability for a Members Product to be linked to a Global Product, i.e. there would be a foreign key constraint that if the GlobalProductId isnt NULL then there should exist a ProductId that matches the GlobalProductId where the MemberId  1.p  pIn my example above I have one global product with a ProductId  1.  Then I create three normal productsp  ul lithe first has no global productli lithe second is linked to the single global product I created earlier then I could link further products to the same global productli lipthe third should fail as I have linked it to a global product that doesnt exist, i.e. this script will return nothingp  precodeSELECT  FROM Products WHERE MemberId  1 AND ProductId  2 codepreli ul  pI can see that the simplest solution would be to create a new table to hold nothing but Global Products.  The problem with this approach is that I have a whole set of routines to load, update, delete data from the Product table and a second set of routines to perform calculations, etc. from the same table.  If I were to introduce a new Global Products table then I would have to duplicate dozens of UDFs to achieve this and my code would become much more complicated.p

Negative 16163 pThis is the need to know details about the problem As a part of an algorithm I am coding, it takes as an input a matrix of size 3000X400. For every row, I need to create a square matrix, ie of size 400x400. After I do this, I need to calculate a number  Ri,j where i,j are the square matrices400x400 that have been generated for every row. p  pThink of it as the computation of a correlation matrix if you will. instead of correlation I have my own algorithm that operates on square matrices generated. I have to compute Ri,j for 0ltilt3000 and ji1 to 3000p  pHere is my question I dynamically allocate a 3D array which points to a square matrix ie my 3d array is 3000X400X400. I dont have enough memory to do this. For smaller sizes ie around 800400400 I have code that works perfectly. But clearly not enough memory to extend it to 3000400 case. How do I do this p  pOnenotsogreatsolution Instead of computing every square matrix, what I do is, compute square matrix for i, and then when I loop around j  i1 to 3000, I recompute the square matrices for each j and then calculate Ri,j. Clearly, I am recomputing a whole bunch of matrices, but atleast it is code that works. p  pAre there are faster solutions that you guys can think of I am competent enough that a qualitative solution will be enough.  I was thinking about computing the square matrices and writing them to files and reading them as and when I need to compute Ri,j  will this be faster than recomputing solution I gave p  pThanks for the advicep  pThe solution using writing to a file and reading from it was way slower.

Negative 16163 pIm trying to come up with a simple solution for a scenario and hoping to get some opinions.  Were in the process of porting a web app to Codeigniter with Ion Auth authentication.  Since password encryption in Codeigniter differs from our current hashing method, all users are going to need new passwords.  What I was thinking is having default passwords for every user, for example, every users password will exists in the db as the encrypted version of their email address they used to sign up.  Once the user logs into the new Codeigniter app for the first time, Id like to set up some sort of temporary validation that prompts them to change their password before continuing.  p  pAny suggestions on the simplest approach to accomplishing this  Im also open to better ideas.p

Negative 16163 pThe ajax below is perfectly working in chrome, IE, opera and safari. But it is, somehow not working in firefox. It says reference error, event is not defined.

Negative 16163 pI use the codeIsMouseOvercode property frequently in my WPF program. Unfortunately, I have other visual elements from other branches of the visual tree that sometimes cover up my controls. When they cover up my controls, the codeIsMouseOvercode becomes false on my controls, even when my mouse is over the covered up control. p  pHow can my control have a property like codeIsMouseOvercode that doesnt care if its covered up at the cursor location Like a hit test that can tunnel threw covers. p  pI looked at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3259161canimakewpfsetismouseoverforboththecoveringandcoveredelementthis solutiona but I dont think I can use it, because it basically uses polling every time that the mouse moves. I think that would slow down my program significantly, because my visual tree is extensive.p  pNote that the visual elements that cover up my controls are not children of my controls.p  pstrongEditstrong Setting codeIsHitTestVisiblecode to false on the element that is doing the covering would be a very nice solution, but when I do that then the covering element doesnt interact with the mouse at all. I need both the covered and the covering elements to react to the mouse. p

Negative 16163 pMaybe the title didnt exactly convey my problem, but a little explanation will be enough. I have this situation where Im developing a website with another friend, and were using Git to manage the versioning of the code, etc.p  pProblem is, at home for both of us is all good, we sync, then we submit changes and commit. But at work and we work at the same company our firewall blocks Git and sometimes we are able to get something done here, but without being able to retrieve or push updates to Git, how do we keep everything synched withtout Git going crazy p  pAfter a few attempts at this, by simply copying everything to a pendrive and then try to sync it all at home, and screwing everything, finally managed something that kinda works, which is by using xcopy with newer files only option. But even that sometimes messes things up.p  pAnyone ever come up a similar situation Any ideas for me Thanks.p

The following code illustrates the way I open the excel file and iterate over the rows in sheet largesheetp  precodeconst string inputFilePath  Clargefile.xlsx const string connectionString      ProviderMicrosoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0Extended PropertiesExcel 12.0IMEX1HDRYESData Source      inputFilePath   Initialize connection using var connection  new OleDbConnectionconnectionString       Open connection     connection.Open       Configure command     var command  new OleDbCommandlargesheet, connection CommandType  CommandType.TableDirect       Execute reader     var reader  command.ExecuteReader  lt Completely loads filesheet into memory       Iterate results     while reader.HasRows               Read single row         reader.Read           ...            Close connection     connection.Close  codepre  pIn my understanding this should open the excel file and load each row when needed by using the emreader.Readem statement.br However, it appears that the emExecuteReaderem statement does more than returning an OleDbDataReader instance. Using breakpoints I noticed that that one statement takes 30s, and the Windows Resource Monitor indicates a steady increase of allocated memory during the execution of that statement.br Specifying the emCommandBehaviorem parameter e.g. emSequentialAccessem of the ExecuteReader method has no effect.p  pWhat am I doing wrong here Are there alternative ways of processing large excel filesp  pstrongNotestrong the IMEX amp HDR extended properties of the connection string are intentional.p  pstrongEditstrong After some rational thinking I assume it is not possible to process an excel file without buffering it one way or another. Since excel files are basically a glorified collection of compressed XML files it is not possible to process a worksheet without decompressing it and keeping it in ram or temporarily saving to disk.br The only alternative I can think of is using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficemicrosoft.office.interop.excel relnofollowMicrosoft.Office.Interop.Excela. Not sure how a hrefhttpopenxmldeveloper.org relnofollowOpenXMLa handles it though.p

But I would like the foreground picture to be displayed at specific coordinates on the background picture. I thought that if I wanted to display the foreground at coordinates 50, 50, I could say backgr.addforeground, 50,50, this compiles but returns an error when I run the program. Any tips of what to do It would be really appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrong I discovered that by saying backgr.setLayoutnull, backgr.addforegr and then foregr.setLocation50,50, we can do what I was looking for. But since not using a layout manager is discouraged, I am looking for better solutions, so that I can use the coordinates on the backgr Icon.p
Negative 16163 pIve been using CMake and Eclipse on linux for a while and have been working with multiple target projects containing numerous executables and shared objects.p  pI use out of source builds and on linux the binaries are put into their own directories. When I do this on linux eclipse is somehow able to find the shared objects and run the executables fine but on windows this doesnt happen.p  pOn Windows I am having to add a PATH environment variable that points to the dlls or I could build into a single bin and lib directory although I had an issue Ive forgotten in the past with CMake that made me want to avoid this.p  pWhy is this working differently on Windows to linux Is it a setting Im missing or does this just not workp  pThe builds themselves are working perfectly.

Negative 16163 pFrom what I have understood, minor and major ids in beacons are used for segmentation for instance, major for physical stores and minor for different locations within a given store.p  pThen, as a beacon does not deliver rich payload, I guess those ids will be exploited to deserve the adequate information to the user  and probably through webservices.p  pFinally, UUID are said to be for the whole fleet. From what I understand, an app e.g for retail store is likely to register for only one or a few UUID generally one, more for complex architectures or overload of services.p  pAt the application level, you can 1 range for beacons when the app is foreground with catching capabilities for minormajor ids, and 2 detect region exitentry codemonitoringForRegioncode while in background  deliver UILocalNotification to wake up the app going back to 1.p  pNow lets deal with the end user. I think we can assume that the average one will not go through a whole retail store with the app in foreground in his hand, and is more likely to have it running in background. Consequently, case 2 will be the most common one. But as all emitters will share the same UUID and as the geolocation manager running in background is monitoring for region linked to UUID, didEnter and didExit regions delegate methods risk no to be triggered intelligently depending on the rangeconfiguration of emitters. Finally, not all the indoor locationbased advertising you wanted to broadcast to your customers will be received and catched. In fact, I fear that only the one when the customer will arrive at the store location will be systematically suggested in a background mode context.p  pAm I missing somethingp

Negative 16163 pI have many measures of distinct count in a cube. My problem is that those measures count the null value as well. Ive found two solutions to eliminate the null valuep  ol lipIve created named queries in data source view for each measure where i put the condition that the column that i need does not contains  null [where column is not null] but this solution is not that practical, because if you have many measures, that do not need to count the null value you have to make a lot of fact tables as named queries to eliminate the nullpli lipIve created an additional column as Named calculation in the fact table, where i tested if the column that i need contains null to put 1 else to put 0 CASE WHEN Column IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0. After that i created a measure of maximum on this additional column and i created a measure of distinct count on the column that i needed . And finally, i created a calculation where i tested the following IIF[measure that i need] [Maximum of additional column]lt0,null,[measure that i need] [Maximum of additional column]pli ol  pBoth solutions works but my question is if there is another solution more simple than those two mentioned or if there is an option in SSAS.  If someone knows please share the information.p

I suppose I emcouldem just force the caller to make the second dimension codeMAXPATHcode so the function would receive a variablelength list of filename buffers, each codeMAXPATHcode long, but this seems messy to me.p  pI considered a wrapper in the style of the Windows APIsp  precodebool ELFindNextFileInFolderconst wchart folderPath, const wchart fileMask, const bool fullPath, wchart fileBuffer, sizet fileBufferSize, HANDLE searchToken codepre  pThis would perform the search, return the first filename found, and save the search handle provided by codeFindFirstFilecode. Future calls to codeELFindNextFileInFoldercode would provide this search handle, making it easy to pick up where the last call left off codeFindNextFilecode would just get the saved search handle. However, such handles are required to be closed via codeFindClosecode, and C doesnt seem to have the C concept of a smart pointer so I cant guarantee the codesearchTokencode will ever be closed. I can close some of the HANDLEs myself when codeFindNextFilecode indicates there are no more results, but if the caller abandons the search before that point therell be a floating HANDLE left open. Id very much like my library to be wellbehaved and not leak HANDLEs everywhere, so this is out. Id also prefer not to provide an codeELCloseSearchHandlecode function, since Im not sure I can trust callers to use it properly.p  pIs there a good, preferably singlefunction way to wrap these Windows APIs, or am I simply going to have to pick one from a list of imperfect solutionsp

Negative 16163 pSo I have an iOS app I am working on and Im running into a problem with a codeUIScrollViewcode and its contents.

However, I am not entirely sure how to accomplish this.  I have tried to find methods through google, but the only thing I could find is MPIIO.

If not, are there any alternatives for writing concurrently to a sqlite databasep  pEDITp  pAs CL pointed out in a comment, sqlite3 does not support concurrent writes to the database.  So let me ask my question a little differently  Is there a way to lock writes to the database so that other processes wait till the lock is removed before writing  I know sqlite3 has its own locking modes, but these modes seem to cause insertions to fail rather than block.  I know Ive seen something like this in Python threading, but I havent been able to find anything online about doing this with MPI.p

Negative 16163 pUntil now I always used a main moc for the main thread, initialised like thisp  precode[[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init] codepre  pand then I have codeNSOperationcode subclasses with their own moc that import data from the webservice, and I merge in the main moc on save observing codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode But now I need the ability to add temporary objects that the user can commit or not later. So it looks like a child context is the perfect fit, and in order to use child context I changed the initialization of my main moc top  precode [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyTypeNSMainQueueConcurrencyType] codepre  pThe question is can my current structure with codeNSOperationcode subclasses with their own moc initialised without a type in their own thread have problems if used along with the child context strategy I dont think so, but I dont find much about mixing those strategies.p  pNote that I want to maintain the codeNSOperationcode subclasses and I dont want to use child contexts also for importing my data, because it suffers on performances, see a hrefhttpfloriankugler.comblog2013429concurrentcoredatastackperformanceshootout relnofollowhttpfloriankugler.comblog2013429concurrentcoredatastackperformanceshootoutap  pMoreover, when I create a new child of my main thread that is of type codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode, can I create it that child with type codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode, continuing to work with my objects in the main thread as usual Or am I forced to use codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode, and use codeperformBlockcode for every operation on my objects Im asking because is not clear from the documentation if using 2 moc on the same thread the main thread in this case could be a problem.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Finally I implemented and used this solution on production and there are not problems so far. The only thing that I needed to do is to avoid merging on my codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode notification when the moc has a codeparentContextcode we dont want to merge mocs with a parent context, because they manage the merge themselves, but obviously the notification is triggered also for codesavecode on this kind of mocp

Negative 16163 pWe have an application were were using ServiceStack.Redis for caching. The application is a REST API, where we serve the responses in JSON.

Negative 16163 pI have a spring batch job where the ItemWriter posts to a web service. I have an input file that I must transform and post to a web service, I do not have direct access to the database. p  pMy question is, how should I handle failure responses from the web service For example, if i am processing a record and I send it to the web service, but the web service responds, Failure  cant find that id How should I record that this record failed in a business sense in spring batch I was hoping to throw a skippable exception, so that in Spring Batch Admin a write skip would be recorded, but I see when I throw an error from the item writer, the chunk is automatically rolled back. And then when the chunk is reprocesses, records get sent to the web service for a second time.p  pWhats the recommendation on this kind of scenario Something like send the bad record to another item writer that records it in a separate place Or is there a way to record it as write skip without rolling back I realize this may be a larger architecture problem in our application and am open to suggestions.p  pthanksp

Negative 16163 pI have been trying to teach myself some simple computer vision algorithms and am trying to solve a problem where I have some noise corrupted image and all I am trying to do is separate the black background from the foreground which has some signal. Now, the background RGB channels are not all completely zero as they can have some noise. However, the human eye can easily discern the foreground from the background.p  pSo, what I did was use the SLIC algorithm to break the image down into super pixels. The idea being that since the image is noise corrupted, doing statistics on the patches might result in better classification of background and foreground because of higher SNR.p  pAfter this, I get around 100 patches which should have similar profile and the result of SLIC seems reasonable. I have been reading about graph cuts the Kolmogorov paper and it seemed like something nice to try for the binary problem I have. So, I constructed a graph which is a first order MRF and I have edges between the immediate neighbours 4connected graph.p  pNow, I was wondering what possible unary and binary terms I can use here to do my segmentation. So, I was thinking for the unary term, I can model it as a simple Gaussian where the background should have a zero mean intensity and the foreground should have some nonzero mean. Although, I am struggling to figure out how to encode this. Should I just assume some noise variance and compute probabilities directly using patch statistics p  pSimilarly, for neighbouring patches I do want to encourage them to take similar label but I am not sure what binary term I can design that reflects that. Seems just the difference between the label 1 or 0 seems weird...p  pSorry for the longwinded question. Hoping someone can give some helpful hint on how to start.p

I think that the problem that I am running into is that I want to UNDERSTAND whyhow these work so that I am not cutpasting someone elses solution into my code but then having to ask again later when something else crops up because I dont know what my pasted code is doing. p  pI am finding however that everyone has a different way to skin this cat and none of them seem to match up with my understanding of HOW this is supposed to work.p  pWhat I am attempting to do is build a form using the a hrefhttpmetroui.org.ua relnofollowMetro UI CSSa library. I thought I would start with a simple textbox. yep ... just a emsimpleem text box. A Metro UI textbox has some nice built in functionality that I wanted to preserve so I thought that was good place to start.p  pI read that in order to leverage Metro UI behaviors with AngularJS I would need to wrap it in a custom directive a hrefhttpblog.sapere.esp327 relnofollowCustom datadirectives inside an AngularJS ngrepeata. While this example wasnt emexactlyem what I was looking for it seemed to easily explain what I needed to do. Just call the function that applies the behavior in the LINK function of the directive and add the directive attribute to the input element ...p  pSo I created a directive called metroInputTransform and added it as an attribute to an input element. p  precodeltdiv datangcontrollerpageOneFormCtrl as pagegt     ltinput  typetext idtxProductName              datangmodelpage.data.productName             datametroinputtransform             placeholderproduct name gt ltdivgt codepre  pIn the LINK function of the directive I simply called the method that applies the behavior I was looking for. I know that this is a little more verbose than it needs to be but I am trying to learn it so I am stepping through it as best as I can. ... for full code see a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgarystenstromxcx2y8uk63 relnofollowthis fiddleap  precodevar metroDirectives  angular.modulemetroDirectives, []     metroDirectives.directivemetroInputTransform, function compile           function postLinkscope, element, attrs, controller               element.inputTransform                   return              priority 100,             compile function element, attrs                   return  postLink                             codepre  pSo this worked, partially. It created the Metro look and feel and associated behavior, but ... ngModel was not binding to the element. So this began a long journey through concepts such as isolate scope, breaking out the various compile, controller, prelink, postlink functions, at least two different ways of persisting ngModel ... all of which did not work. p  pAfter a variety of reading it was my understanding that the DOM manipulation should happen in the COMPILE function so that any DOM transformations would be available for the compile and then linking stages of the digest process.

I know that this is a matter of my ignorance and lack of understanding on howwhy AngularJS works the way it does.

Short of dropping 3000 on live inperson seminars that I cannot afford where I can ask the questions I need answered, I am at a complete dead end with Angular. p  pI would be most grateful if anyone could provide guidance, direction ... a good resource ... anything that can help shed some light on this issue in particular, but anything that might help me stop spinning my wheels. In the meantime I will continue to read and reread everything I can find and hopefully something will break.p  pThanksp  pGp  pstrongUPDATE  10302014strongp  pI am soooo over this issue but want to follow it through. I need and want to learn this. Also I really want to express appreciation for the effort that folks have put into this and while they have presented some solutions, which ultimately may be the best way to go, they have both skirted the issue, which is that I am attempting to use the behaviors provided with the Metro UI CSS library. I would prefer to not have to rewrite them if possible. p  pBoth solutions provided so far have eliminated the key statement from the solution ... which is the line ... p  precodeelement.inputTransform codepre  pI dont want to post the entire jQuery widget that comprises the inputTransform definition, but I cut the meat of it out and included it here ... p  precode    function createInputValelement, name, buttonName           var wrapper  ltdivgt.addClassinputcontrol.addClassname         var button  ltbuttongt.addClassbuttonName         var clone  element.clonetrue  clone the original element         var parent  element.parent          clone.appendTowrapper         button.appendTowrapper         wrapper.insertBeforeelement         element.remove  delete the original element          return wrapper      codepre  pSo, I have applied the directive as an attribute because the Metro code behind it wants to CLONE the textbox which would not do if it was an element directive and then REMOVES the original input element. It then creates the new DOM elements and wraps the cloned input element in the newly created DIV container. The catch, I believe is ...  that the binding is being broken when the original element is being cloned and removed from the DOM. Makes sense, if the ngmodel attribute assignment is bound to a strongemreferenceemstrong of the textbox. So the expectation that I originally had was, since the ngmodel attribute was cloned along with the rest of the element, that in the compile eventfunctionphase of the directive the reference would bereestablished to the newly created input element. This apparently was not the case. You can see in this updated a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgarystenstromcLnszqnk3 relnofollowfiddlea that I have made some attempts at reconnecting the ngmodel to the new DOM elements with no success. p  pPerhaps this is impossible ... it certainly seems that just rebuilding these things may ultimately be the easier way to go. p  pThanks again Mikko Viitalia and azium ... p

The problem arises in button 2 where I call, using a Thread, the function ploting2 defined in modules.py. I am using Thread because I need to perform some calculations at same time plotting the curve. Both functions are the same, but the one called from modules.py doesnt show the plot. Any hint on what I am doing wrongp  pThanks in advance for the help.p  pPS I get no error message, everything works fine, apart from button 2 that doesnt show the plot.p

Negative 16163 pUsing Python 3.4. Have attempted to call function prime2 that returns a booleanalways either True or Falsefrom within an IFstatement.

Sometimes the return is None, at which point the test fails. I use Pythons IDLE and its debugger. I call primes2, 5, [] and step through the code. When prime2 reaches line elif n lt p while n  5 and p  5, the debugger shows that prime2 returns True, as it should, but the line in primes3 elif primem, 2 takes a value of None.

Negative 16163 pIm looking for an answer to a hypothetical, but not implausible, problem that I may run into, and possible ways to solve the problem. My question is strongwhat happens when you attempt to connect a new TCP socket when theres no bandwidth left to do the handshake in a reasonable amount of timestrongp  pDoes the socket just time out How realistic is this scenario Im building an application that is responsible for querying over 50,000 Minecraft multiplayer servers as quickly and accurately as possible  hopefully within minutes. This includes performing DNS address and SRV queries. These servers receive an uptime penalty on our website if we cannot connect to them so it is important that we know whether or not they are actually available.p  pI have the underlying networking handled using an extremely lightweight codejava.nio.channelscode reactor implementation, but now Im worried that the application will be extremely IO bound. strongHow do you guys recommend solving this tradeoff between bandwidth and accuracystrongp

Negative 16163 pIm using the codeManipulationDeltacode event handler to drag and drop a simple ellipse in a canvas across the screen. Im using the standard approach posted online in several places. Following is the code in my event handlerp  precodeEllipse dragableItem  sender as Ellipse TranslateTransform translateTransform  dragableItem.RenderTransform as TranslateTransform double newPosX  Canvas.GetLeftdragableItem  translateTransform.X  e.Delta.Translation.X double newPosY  Canvas.GetTopdragableItem  translateTransform.Y  e.Delta.Translation.Y  if isCanvasBoundarynewPosX, TestCanvas.ActualWidth  dragableItem.ActualWidth, 0       translateTransform.X  e.Delta.Translation.X  if isCanvasBoundarynewPosY, TestCanvas.ActualHeight  dragableItem.ActualHeight, 0       translateTransform.Y  e.Delta.Translation.Y codepre  pThe drag and drop operation works fine, but theres a nasty delay of around 1 second between when the user begins dragging to when the ellipse actually changes its position. I can see by printing to the Debugger that the event handler itself finishes executing almost instantly, so Im guessing it has something to do a preprogrammed refresh rate for all UIElements on the screen thats causing this delayp  pIs there anyway around this issue  p

Negative 16163 pi am trying to realize the following scenario and am failing to do so since about a week.p  pI have a bluetooth mouse which id like to connect to my android phone and use it in an app. The problem is that i dont want to use the built in HID protocol because it has some limitations i dont like especially swallowing signals when to short and stuff like that. In optimum case i want the app to start, open an inputstream to the already paired and connected BT mouse and add my listeners to it.p  pWell what i did achieve to do is, given that the device is NOT connected to the builtin android BT Manager, get a BluetoothSocket, connect to it and add my inputstream to it. Problem is If the user decides to use the OS features to make the connection, my app fails. Also i have to etablish the connection by clicking the BTbutton on the mouse with every app start. I currently open the connection by using java reflection to call createRfcommSocketand then connect if getInputStream.available fails.p  pHow can i directly read the data of the BT device, without using the HID protocol It doesnt matter if the mousefunctions still work or not.p  pIf such a thing is not possible, id like my app to remeber the pairing process with the app. Meaning When i start the app, i want my last pairing to reetablish automatically without pushing the connectbutton. Android itself is able to do it I turn on BT, click on the mouse leftbutton  the mouse connects.p  pI would really, really appreciate every hint you have for as im desperate.p

Is there a way to do this with a function or class constructor p  pMy current code looks something like thisp  precodeif  productsresultslist[key][sChgDesc]  Small Box       smallbox  array         ChargeDescID gt productsresultslist[key][ChargeDescID],         sChgDesc gt productsresultslist[key][sChgDesc],         dcPrice gt productsresultslist[key][dcPrice],         dcTax1Rate gt .0 . productsresultslist[key][dcTax1Rate],         dcInStock gt productsresultslist[key][dcInStock],       codepre  pAfter writing the above if statement about 8 times, with many more times needed, Im thinking there must be a better practice than just writing everything out.p  pI want to do something likep  precodeproductconstructorargument, productname    if  arguement       productname  array         ChargeDescID gt productsresultslist[key][ChargeDescID],         sChgDesc gt productsresultslist[key][sChgDesc],         dcPrice gt productsresultslist[key][dcPrice],         dcTax1Rate gt .0 . productsresultslist[key][dcTax1Rate],         dcInStock gt productsresultslist[key][dcInStock],       codepre  pand then just call the function or constructor as needed likep  precodeproductconstructor productsresultslist[key][sChgDesc]  Small Box, smallbox codepre  pI actually tried the above code, but it was throwing errors. Despite working with PHP daily, I still dont know much about constructors, and figured this might be the perfect opportunity to learn how to do this correctly.p  pIm not sure if classes are the right choice for this since Im going to need to pull the products themselves into product package classes later.p

Negative 16163 pNote My question has not been asked anywhere on the internet as far as I can see, and Ive been searching for almost two days.p  pI have a content div with translucent background and decorative border around it that sits perfectly under the site logo, but wont stretch down to meet the top portion of the footer which is stuck to the bottom of the page with position absolute. This is a Contact page with a couple sentences of text and a simple contact form, therefore not enough content to fill up the whole page.p  pSpecifically, I need a div with a border around it to fill up the whole page, without creating a vertical scroll bar, and meet the top of a absolutely positioned footer. p  pThe rest of the site does not use an absolutely positioned footer as there is enough content to consistently push the footer far down.

This query properly grabs those two date values, but I would like them in one column name so I can sort the column to return the most recent dates. p  precodeSELECT m.id, m.name, m.description, m.directions, m.type, m.datecreate, ce.datedecide FROM markers AS m LEFT OUTER JOIN     SELECT entityid, entitytype, maxdatedecide as datedecide    FROM contentedits    WHERE status1     GROUP BY entityid, entitytype ce ON ce.entityidm.id LIMIT 500 codepre  pI assume the answer would have some flavor of IF null THEN m.datecreate, but I dont have much idea where this would go or of the proper syntax.p  pSincere thanks for any help.

Negative 16163 pYes, I read an article by Eric Hammond a hrefhttpalestic.com201109ec2rebootstopstart relnofollow titlehereherea where he mentions that the private IP would also change when restarting. A few months ago, when I first got an AWS cluster up for hadoop, I used the internal IP to configure etchosts and the internal IP wouldnt change even when the instance is stopped, i can see the internal IP.p  pTo replicate this cluster as part of our corporate account, I created a few AMIs and used those to launch the instances. Now, the IPs are changing each time the machine is restarted. p  pOn checking the machines that did emnotem have the IP change, there doesnt seem to be anything special about them. They are the same simple EBS backed instances with volumes. Hmm, so whats the difference between them p
Negative 16163 pI start with a normal sphere which I need to deform into an ovallooking shape.

It works well for my intentions, but I still need to figure out a good way to fix the normals and get proper shadows, as they are still tied to the original sphere.p  pAfter hunting for an answer on Google I stumpled upon a hrefhttphttp.developer.nvidia.comGPUGemsgpugemsch42.html relnofollow titleChapter 42  DeformersGPU Gems  Deformersa, which related to the normals but I dont quite understand the concepts explained. The Jacobian Matrix seems like it would be able to solve my normals problem but I am not so sure and would like some kind of help or feedback regarding my calculation, as it is hard to see from the render in my given test program.p  pSince I am stretching in the emyem dimension I have a normal unit matrix of size 4, where I just replace the emy 1em with em1.5aem. This would be my Jacobian Matrix, if I understood the text properly. emInversingem and then emtransposingem this matrix would then be what I would multiply my normals with. Can I also use this on my emShadowMatrixemp  precodeNormal  transposeinverseToOvalMat  vec4VertexNormal, 0..xyz Normal  normalizeViewMatrix  WorldMatrix  vec4Normal, 0..xyz codepre  pI am getting some artifacts with these calculations and they are not completely selling it for me in regards to believability, which makes me feel like something is off with my matrices or something.

Negative 16163 pIm currently working on implementing a messaging based system also using a mixture DDD, CQRS, event sourcing etc, as appropriate. The general pattern being used is atleastonce messaging with deduping consumersidempotent receivers. p  pOne sticking point is out of order messages. An approach advocated by Vaughn Vernon in his book a hrefhttpwww.amazon.co.ukImplementingDomainDrivenDesignVaughnVernondp0321834577 relnofollowImplementing Domain Driven Designa chapter 13, roughly p475 onwards is to use a MemberChangeTracker, which checks the date of the messages and behaves accordingly the example given is a Disable  message arrives emafterem an Enable  message, despite being generated first. The change tracker checks the date occurred and only applies the second message coming in the Disable msg if the date occurred is subsequent to the last received event. p  pThis is messy. The compensating behaviour is difficult and the combinations could explode fairly quickly. Vaughns answer is simple dont take responsibility for data in an external system, which makes sense. However, if you do need to do this, is there a better approachp  pMy question is could each consumer subscribe to every single event from a given Aggregate, keep track of the message order so each event would have a message order number on it Creation  1 UpdateToAggregate  2 Cancel  3 and  filter only for the ones it is interested in Doing this would allow the consumer to see that the Enable message it receives is out of order, and wait until it receives the missing message in this case, Disable, or it could just be one its not even interested in This would allow the consumer to apply messages in order and simplify its handler logic significantly.p  pstrongIs this a valid approachstrong What are the tradeoffs here e.g. delayed message processing waiting for inorder messages to arrive This seems a logical  albeit slightly uncomfortable, as every consumer has to subscribe to emeveryem message, not nice  approach. Would this be practicalp

Due to the changes in communication between the application client and the server, i created a small testclient to check for pitfalls.p  pOne of these is that the entitymanager in my stateless session beans is not injected, leaving the EntityManager NULL. I tried working around this using the EntityManagerFactory, but neither is injected. The datasource referenced is available and the connection has been tested against the database.p  pI hope that some of you have come across this problem, can think of where i can look next or what i might do to track this issue down. Enclosed are the persistence.xml, RemoteInterface and Bean code from server side as well as my test client code.p  pPlease let me know if i can provide more information. The classes have mostly retained their name from the EJB 2 application in case you are wondering.p  pStateless Session Bean GUITabUsersDaop  precodeStateless RemoteGUITabUsersDaoRemote.class public class GUITabUsersDao implements GUITabUsersDaoRemote      Logger logger  Logger.getLoggerGUITabUsersDao.class.getName      PersistenceContextname  OracleGUIDS, type    PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION     EntityManager entityManager      Override     public ListltGUITabUsersgt findAll throws FinderException           ListltGUITabUsersgt resultList  null          TypedQueryltGUITabUsersgt namedQuery          if entityManager  null               logger.severe CKU This is not going to end well. entitymanager is null.             else              namedQuery  entityManager.createNamedQueryGUITabUsers.FINDALL, GUITabUsers.class             resultList  namedQuery.getResultList                  return resultList       codepre  pThe Remote Interfacep  precodepublic interface GUITabUsersDaoRemote      ListltGUITabUsersgt findAll throws FinderException  codepre  pThe persistence.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltpersistence version2.0 xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnspersistence xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnspersistence httpjava.sun.comxmlnspersistencepersistence20.xsdgt     ltpersistenceunit nameOracleGUIDS transactiontypeJTAgt         ltjtadatasourcegtjavajbossdatasourcesOracleGUIDSltjtadatasourcegt         ltclassgtde.printcom.loginmodule.GUITabUsersltclassgt         ltpropertiesgt             lt Properties for Hibernate  gt             ltproperty namehibernate.hbm2ddl.auto valueverifygt             ltproperty namehibernate.showsql valuefalsegt         ltpropertiesgt     ltpersistenceunitgt ltpersistencegt codepre  pThe client code p  precodepackage de.my.test  public class TestClient      public static final String URL  localhost     public static final String PORT  4447      private static final Logger LOGGER  Logger.getLoggerTestClient.class.getName      public static void mainString[] args          IDPLookupRemote bean         LAECMachineControlSES bean2         GUITabUsersDaoRemote guiTabUsersDao         try              EJBHomeFactory factory  EJBHomeFactory.getInstanceURL, PORT             guiTabUsersDao  GUITabUsersDaoRemote lookupGUITabUsersDao, GUITabUsersDaoRemote.class             LOGGER.infoBean   guiTabUsersDao.toString   received.

Negative 16163 pI am rather new to vxworks,  and I am building an application,  which needs to allocate some memmory dynamically.  I have configured the kernel for a memory size of 750mb. I am allocating memory in blocks 10 numbers each of size 32mb in the very beginning of the program,  but after the 5th or 6th block allocation,  I am getting allocation failure with message memPartAlloc block too big 15912260 bytes 0x10 aligned  in partition 0xe004608 on console. p  pHow could memory allocation be failing when there is enough memory available I do not think memory had fragmented enough for allocation to fail right in the beginning of my program and as  per output of memShow,  there is indeed enough free memory to satisfy the request. p  pIf memory has indeed fragmented due to any strange reason, is there some way to compact free space and continue in Vxworks p  pAny hint would be much appreciated.  Cheers. p

Negative 16163 pWe have a product that is using Asp.Net identity where we want the cookie expiry time to be configurable.

Negative 16163 pIm trying to use the javax.validation framework for a all the web apps validation needs. In order to do this, I need to write some validators that access the main object being validated. For example, lets say my object has startDate and endDate and I need to validate to make sure that startDate is not greater than endDate. Or any other scenario where one fields validation depends on the contents of another field inside the main object.p  pMy question is how do I get to those other fields, or to the main object itself from the validator. I have a feeling I might be able to get to it via constraintValidatorContext, but havent yet figured out how.p  pIm using the following for writing custom validators a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orghibernatevalidator4.1referenceenUShtmlvalidatorcustomconstraints.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.jboss.orghibernatevalidator4.1referenceenUShtmlvalidatorcustomconstraints.htmlap  pIs ConstraintValidator even the right tool for the job here Basically, my end goal is to have all validation happen by just looping through validators like thisp  precode    ValidatorFactory factory  Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory     Validator validator  factory.getValidator     SetltConstraintViolationltMyClassgtgt violations  validator.validatemyObject      forConstraintViolationltMyClassgt validation  violations               put error message in a collection to display in the jsp      codepre  pAnd not have a whole string of ifelses or trycatches in the validate method that are checking each field.p  pAlso, my project does not use any frameworks like Hybernate or Spring, and I cant really integrate them into it at this point. Its just a standard Servletjsp project.p

Negative 16163 pI have a Web User Control which I have developed to represent a company object and the services the company is subscribing to. The control has a public property CompanyId which the host page sets. When the property is set, the control connects to the BLL and retrieves the company details and a list of services the company is subscribing to. It then populates the various textboxes for the details. For the services, I use a CheckBoxList control which I create from all available services and loop through the company services checking off the ones the company is subscribing to.p  pThe control also has a Save method which causes all values in the textboxes to be saved. For the services, I am looping through all checkboxes and createdelete service subscriptions from the DB accordingly.p  pWhen I set the CompanyId by selecting from a grid on the host page, the control populates all fields as it should. However when I call the Save method, all textbooks are saved fine, but the CheckBoxList has no items, and therefore no subscriptions get saved. It looks like the CheckBoxList control is losing its items when I post back. I should note here that the PageLoad event is not used to set anything as already mentioned I am setting values when the CompanyId property changes.p  pAny ideas I would appreciate any help on this...p

Negative 16163 pIve written a short program to transfer the data from a JSON file into a SQLite file, and although Im not getting any errors , its just isnt working.p  pMy goal is to build an app that will have a default SQLite db file that the app will load on startup.

Negative 16163 pUnfortunately, Im finding the current documentationexamples for the usage of paperstyles a bit lacking.
