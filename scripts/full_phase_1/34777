Positive 34777 pI have a report that consists of a single column tablix with a single row that is grouped. Inside the row are three sub reports. The Header of the report is supposed to display three pieces of information unique to the data that the row is grouped on so the header is unique for each. p  pI attempted to populate the data in the header by having hidden controls in the body that I then referenced in the expressions of the controls in the header. This method didnt work. So I switched to a different possible solution I found which was to populate variables using VB and reference them in the header using codeCode.variableNamecode in the expression. The function to populate the variables is called from a hidden control in the body which passes the data as parameters. p  pThis method worked. However, it only seems to work on my local machine and one of my coworkers machines in BIDS preview. When the report is published to the report server, it runs and everything seems fine, except the header values dont populate.p  pOne of the variables is an integer and the other two are strings. The integer value is initialized to 0 and in the report from the report server it shows the initialized value of 0, but the strings are still blank. This makes me think that the function isnt being called or there might be a scope issue Or it could be something completely different that Im not familiar with. Possibly a configuration issue with the report serverp  pHere is the report a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGOt6B.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGOt6B.png altScreenshot of the report designerap  pIf you can see the tiny little control about halfway down the report on the left side. Its just a tiny little box.. The expression for that control isp  pcodeCode.GetHeaderDataFieldsSEPID.Value, FieldsFullName.Value, FieldsLevel.Valuecodep  pThe Function isp  precode    Shared Public Dim SEPIDVar as Integer     Shared Public Dim FullNameVar as String     Shared Public Dim LevelVar as String  Public Shared Function GetStudentHeaderData     ByVal sepid as Integer,      ByVal fullname as String,      ByVal level as String         SEPIDVar  sepid         FullNameVar  fullname         LevelVar  level End Function codepre  pThe three header controls have the following expressionsp  precodeCode.FullNameVar Code.SEPIDVar Code.LevelVar codepre  pAnd then here are some screenshots showing the difference in how the report looks when I preview it locally from BIDS vs running it on sql report serverp  pThe working header when viewing preview in BIDS 2008 on local machine values distorted  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comefUZF.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comefUZF.png altenter image description hereap  pAnd the broken header when viewing the report from the report server a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comniz3K.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comniz3K.png altenter image description hereap  pIve spent multiple days now scourging the internet for a solution to no avail.

Positive 34777 pI have an SSRS report that populates a parameter with a stored procedure. This query works as expected. When the parameter is used in running the report, the parameter is being truncated. I choose value ABCD, but the report returns values for ABC. The stored procedure I am passing the parameter to runs perfectly in SSMS and returns ABCD data. When I test the query in the query designer or I run the report, I get ABC data. How do I get SSRS to pass in the entire parameterp
Positive 34777 pIt seems so basic and surely resolved in SSRS 2014 SP1 but I cant find a way in Print Layout for PDF ultimately, but this is simple display to strongallow a tablix to render at the top of following pages when a text box displays above it on the first pagestrong eg. address details which would not be wanted on every subsequent page filled by tablix results. This results in unprofessional wasted white space above the results on every page after the first. p  pThe tablix seems stuck so it only starts on the page wherever you put it on the design layout using Report Builder because SSDT not playing with VS2015, but same things should apply.

If I choose a parameter period with only one project, the line descriptions strongwillstrong continue on the top of any subsequent pages. Only if the tablix header group Project [TaskDesc] and Worker changes does a new page start  but with the tablix at the original page 1 layout location ie under the textbox, not at the top of the subsequent page where it should be. Hope this clarifies  looks like a bug, odd tablix behaviour, but maybe a workaroundp
Positive 34777 pI am not able to disclose very much information, but our software is in the healthcare industry on the practice side. My company is building a new web based product, in which our users will be able access and run reports. We are working to make it a single page dashboard interface where they can select a report from one of the 100 reports that we have available in our other product. p  pAdvice that I need is in how to generate the reports. We would like to avoid having to create separate forms for each report, and instead have a way to use the fields in the report to generate the form. My thoughts are that we should be able to build a framework for this that would make everything simpler.p  pI apologize in advance for how convoluted this explanation is. Any advice is greatly appreciated.p
Positive 34777 pBecause we design in a multi tier release environment, we have similar data on 3 SQL servers.  We may have three copies of the same report directed to the different data bases.  We name the reports with the source in the name.  i.e. Report 1 UAT.  Users do not pay attention.  When a report is run and exported, you can no longer see the name so what looks like a production report could be a UAT copy.  What I am trying to do is add a placeholder in the title that lists the data source for the reports primary dataset.  I thought I would find a resource that said dataset1.datasource that returned the name I had assigned the data source at creation.  That does not appear to be the case. Any ideas how to accomplish the same thing.p

Positive 34777 pI have created an SSRS report which I am using in Asp.net website. Reports accepts server, database,user and password to create connection string dynamically. Dynamic connection string is required because user can select a database at the time of login and that database need to be used for SSRS.p  pOne requirement is such that user should be able to create SSRS report himself. For the purpose I provided guideline that how to create parameters that are require datasources dynamic connection string.p  pOne possible problem I thought is if user do not make parameters as hidden, he will have database credential in clear text.p  pI thought of adding encryption at asp.net website and decryption in SSRS report but decryption functioncode will be easily accessible at the time of designing.p  pAny idea how to overcome the situationp

Positive 34777 pIve been spending the last few hours googling for an answer and Im beginning to think Im the only human being on Earth having to cope with this problem. So Ill ask my first ever question on Stack Overflow.p  pWe are building a large solution for one of our customer using Microsoft Dynamics 4. Im in charge of SSRS reports and Im using Visual Studio 2005 to build my reports, which I then upload with the crms UI.p  pEverything works fine, really, except this one little thing when using prefiltering eg. CRMAFemSomeEntityem, Id like to removedisable the default filter Modified in the last 30 days without having to go in the UI and delete it. p  pI want this because everytime I add a new report or modify one. Or worst, everytime code is migrated to a new environment we have to delete the default filter for 27 reports more to come, one by one. But I still want prefiltering to work using CRMAFemSomeEntityem.p  pThere must be some setting somewhere where we can configure this option. But I cant find anything.p  pThank you.p
Positive 34777 pI have googled countless of times on finding out emWhen the grid report expanded, the chart displays a bar graphem. So I would have a separate pie chart and a separate collapsible grid report when I click on the toggle function, it will display another graph which is a bar graph.There arent any helpful information on that. Id tried having the bar chart within the same scope as grid but that doesnt work either. I was wondering if this is possible in an ssrs tool such as visual studio data tools. If yes, any advice or suggestions would greatly be appreciated. Thanks so muchp

Positive 34777 pSo, Im going along in SSRS building a new report, as you do, and as Im building the query from my SSAS cube I get the error The Cubes collection has been updated on the server.  I cant find anything on the interwebs that would fix my issue.  The odd thing is that I can build out the query for a while before getting this error, meaning Im able to add 710 fields before the error presents itself.  After the error I cant save it because it cant verify that the query is working.  So I have to close it all down and restart building the query, but again, after a few fields get added I get the same error.p  pYesterday we added a tabular instance to our BI server so we could convert our SSAS cubes to a tabular model and then utilize power bi and this seems to be when I started to see the issue.  Im not sure if theyre related.  I did restart the server last night hoping that would correct anything that went awry, but to no avail.p

Negative 34777 pI develop tools in Autodesk Maya.  Many of the tools I build have simple windowed GUIs for the animators and modellers to use.  These GUIs often contain what youd normally expect to see in any basic window labels, lists, menus, buttons, textfields, etc.  However, there are limitations to the complexity of the UIs you can build with the available tools, specifically in the types of available widgets.p  pIm interested in using some of the more advanced wxPython widgets such as the ListView grid, Tree, etc.  This would involve using a complete wxFrame window to display the whole UI, which would essentially mean that window would no longer be tied to Maya.  Not a deal breaker, but it means when Maya is minimized, the window wont follow suit.p  pIve tried something like this before with tkinter as a test, but found that it needed a MainLoop to run in its own thread.  This is logical, but in my case, it conflicts with Mayas own thread, essentially making Maya hang until the window is closed.  This is due to the fact that Maya runs all scripts, be they MEL or Python, in a single thread that the main Maya GUI shares.  This is to prevent one script from, say, deleting an object while another script is trying to do work on the same object.p  pwxPython has this same mainloop methodolgy. Im wondering if theres any way around it so that it can work within Mayap

Negative 34777 pI created a DataGrid, that utilizes customized data cells using the DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate directive. I placed a textblock inside with the Text field using a Binding to one of the ItemSource members. As the content of that member differs between Green, Yellow and Red. Everything works fine. The Foreground color of the textblock is being colored by using my own value converter.p  pThe problemp  pI want the columns with my own data cells to be sorted. But as soon as I add the right SortMemberPath they are sorted by using the text due to the binding. Green,Yellow,Redp  pI tried to change the SortMemberPath to the general form of Binding MyDataMember, ConverterStaticResource myDataConverter with pointing to my converter that eats the strings and outputs plain int numbers like Green  1 Yellow  2 Red  3 which would enable the right sorting.p  pBut this is not allowed obviously as the parser cries when starting the application p  pIs there a way of implementing thisp  pThanks a lot p

Negative 34777 pIm running a weird issue here. I have code that makes jquery ajax calls to a web service and dynamically adds controls using jquery.

Is it a jQuery or CSS issuep  pEDIT Im using contentType applicationjson charsetutf8 I copied a test call that had applicationjavascript. p  pGaby Im well aware of the fact that the server has nothing to do with CSS or javascript, however, that is the only difference between the code that does and doesnt work. p  pAll the jquerycss files are identical between my local dev machine IIS 5 and the server iis 6. p  pjaymz Ill give fiddler a try to see if theres a difference. I am using IE8 but it isnt going into compatibility mode. p  pSOLUTION Compatbility Mode After checking everything in Fiddler and finding no differences, I tried it in Firefox, where it worked. Got me to thinking and sure enough, I was wrong, IE WAS going into compatibility mode. apparently by default it will use compatibility mode on the intranet, but not localhost which happened to be the different versions of IIS. I tried  IE7 and got the same thing. I need to change my code to make sure it works on IE7 as well. p

Negative 34777 pStackoverflow has a nifty badge system. One thing I noticed is that badges are not immediately awarded, but sometimes seem to have some type of a delay after I meet the criteria. Ive noticed this on some other sites that have badges as well.p  pPresumably this is because they are using a delayed job that scans periodically to see if any new badges need to be awarded. I see this approach also advised herebr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3162446howtoimplementbadgeshttpstackoverflow.comquestions3162446howtoimplementbadgesap  pHowever, I dont really see why this should be necessary, and am favoring in my implementation to simply have a system where after a relevant action is performed, for example a new comment is posted, a checkAwardBadge function is called, which checks if the user meets the criteria for a new comment badge.p  pSpeedwise, I was thinking that all relevant user stats would simply be stashed in a submodel of User, like UserStats so that instead of having to count the number of comments each time, it would just be a simple query.p  pIt strikes me that the system Im favoring should be fast and very simple to understand. Are there downsides Im missing here on why its necessary to complicate things with delayed jobsp  pTo clarify I plan to have an abstract class Achievements, with each actual Achievement an implementation of Achievements. Each Achievement will have a checkAwardBadge function, which can be called from the controller, or even a delayed job if I should choose to go that route, or any time really, to check whether a user has earned a certain badge. Thus, achievement code would all be centralized.p

Negative 34777 pI am interested in hearing how people do their Lisp webapp deployments and updates especially updates in production. p  pIn Ruby many, myself included, use Capistrano for deployments. It provides some nice indirection and the ability to execute commands remotely and most importantly in my mind the ability to rollback to a working code base. p  pI know that the idea of a long running Lisp process being connected to via Swank through an SSH tunnel and modified in place is a popular idea thats knocked around, but I havent drunk that Koolaid, mostly because of the issue of updating a stateful process which seems like asking for trouble if something goes wrong  like unforeseen impedance mismatches between current state in memory and new object definitions that will soon be in memory. p  pGiven that you can create nearly stateless or completely webapps using hunchentoot or insert your favorite Lisp app server here, it seems like using something like Capistrano could be used for nondisruptive updates to Lisp code too if the Lisp processes hide behind nginx in its upstream channel and if you can correctly choreograph taking down the hunchentoot processes and spin them back up after an update to code, e.g.,  bring them back up all the while leaving at least one hunchentoot process running in the cluster at any given moment CGI or modlisp could be used, but I am not particularly interested in that approach  though if you really like that approach, please at least say something about it, I want to learn. For instance, using Passenger which is comparing oranges to apples since it spins up processes on demand, you touch tmprestart.txt and the app server restarts this time with freshly updated code  no interruptions from the users perspective. p  pWell, this is a bit of a ramble, and actually I am about to try all this out, but Id like to get some feedback on these ideas from others. Maybe you have a better idea.p  pThanksp

Here are some examplesp  precodehttpwww.example.com production httptest.example.com testing httplocalhostdevelopmentfolder development WIN httplocalhost8888developmentfolder development MAC codepre  pThe issue is, that as we have subfolders on the development machines, I cant use an absolute URL as codesubfolder1folder1name1code as it would e.g. point to codehttplocalhostsubfolder1folder1name1code and not to codehttplocalhostdevelopmentfoldersubfolder1folder1name1code so all the rewrites would be broken on the development machines.p  pIs there any chance to get this issue working As the folder codedevelopmentfoldercodeis the same on all development machines, would it help to excludeinclude that folder to the rewrites afterwards like thisp  precodeRewriteRule subfolder2subfolder3folder2folder3name2name3name4 developmentfoldersubfolder1folder1name1 [R301,QSA,NC] RewriteRule developmentfolder. 1 [QSA.NC] RewriteRule subfolder1folder1name1 script.php [QSA.NC] codepre  pOr is there a better way of doing it Any hint would help a lot.p

Negative 34777 pI understand that this has been asked about before, but my issue is somewhat peculiar.  I have two servers under different ports.  I have Geoserver on port 8080 and Apache on port 80.  I also have a proxy on Geoserver running allowing access to the Apache server.  However, when I try to use codephpContent.loadhttplocalhost80testing.htmlcode in a file from Geoserver, just for example, firebug shows me that the request is actually accepted as I get the message GET a hrefhttplocalhost80testing.html relnofollowhttplocalhost80testing.htmla 200 OK 108ms, but it is in red as if something is still going wrong.  Not to mention the content does not display in the div .  I know my code is correct as I have tried the same thing all under the Apache server and everything works as expected.  If it seems weird that I am using a page in Geoserver to make JQuery AJAX calls to Apache, it is because Apache can interpret php and Geoserver does not.

Negative 34777 pBackground There is a table, events this table is formatted latin1.  Individual columns in this table are set to utf8.  The column we will cherry pick to discuss is title which is one of the utf8 columns. The website is set for utf8 both via apache and the meta tag.p  pAs a test, if I save codedcor or code into the title field and perform p  precodeselect title, LENGTHtitle as len, CHARLENGTHtitle as chlen  from events where lengthtitle  charlengthtitle codepre  pI will get codedcor or , 12, 10code back as a result which is expected showing that the data has indeed been properly saved into my utf8 column.p  pHowever, upon echoing the title out to a page, its mangeld into codedcor or code which makes no sense to me since, as mentioned before, the character encoding is set to utf8 on the page.p  pNot sure if this final detail makes a difference but if I edit the page and resubmit the mangled text it turns into codeduFFFDcor or uFFFDcode both in the database and when displayed to the page.  Further submits cause no change.p  pActual Question Does anyone have an idea as to what I may be doing wrong Pp

Negative 34777 pIm considering moving our shop over to VS2010 from VS2008sp1.  Ive been very happy with 2008, but would like to make use of TR1 in our code.p  hr  pstrongIm really interested in fellow programmers gestalt of 2010 v. 2008, rather than the solution to any one element of the followingstrongp  hr  pHowever, Im in the process of converting our projects amp solutions, and Im finding that the noise to signal ratio is rather lame, IMO.  So far, Im looking at rewiring every single project we have to get rid of the various apparently spurious Microsoft Build warnings, such as TargetExt ... does not match the Linkers OutputFile property value ...p  pThere are several variations on this message, several per project, and we have around 75 projects.  I have little or no desire to waste my time redoing all of these projects output targets Apparently MSBuild insists that the linkers target and the compilers target be identical, which is neither necessary nor desirable for us.p  pAdditionally, [embarrassment], we still use VSS.  And just in my initial dealings with trying to massage the projects to compliance with MSBuild, Im finding that the VSS interface in VS2010 is about 14 as fast as in 2008.  Its atrocious and Im used to the relatively lame performance of VSS in general.p  pSigh... I know about 12 or more of the answers are going to be Stop using VSS.  Yeah, thats a great idea, and we may migrate to subversion in the not too distant future.  But one thing at a time.  That only solves the VSS speed issue, not the MSBuild problems, nor the new C problems.p  pIt seems that the new standard libraries and TR1 stuff has broken some of our code.  Thats not in itself too shocking  Id have been surprised if that werent the case.  But as it stands, the error messages are LOOOONNNNNGGGG  it reminds me of my early days of trying to use the STL and having to load an error string parser helper that deduced the higherlevel names for me so that the error messages could become somewhat useful.

Negative 34777 pFirst word of warning, I believe this is a stackoverflow rather than programmers question, Mods feel free to move it if im wrong.p  pThe company I am at is looking to create GIS solutions, which could be based on desktops, mobileWMandroidetc or the web. This is a vague management requirement as the targeted markets are not 100 defined so may not be as heavily GIS based as originally expected. I have been looking into the main GIS providers in the UK and would see these are been Esri, Capcorp and MapInfo. I know ESRI and Cadcorp both have full suites covering our requirements in terms of platform devices and also the targeted experience of the development team which is mostly .net framework.p  pThe problem is picking which company to go with based on a SWOT analysis. So the question I have is to those who have used, one or all systems. And what are the advantages, weaknesses, strengths and opportunities. I have been reading up on them, which is great, but I want to get a feel from those that have used them in the development and business processes.p  pMy feeling is as with many key bits of software they start to merge and cover the same functionality, making competitor products hard to differentiate. I have only had a small chance to use ESRI and found it slow and verbose to program in, compared to a Cadcorp demonstration I was at which also showed it could import almost any time of map data natively. My concerns with Cadcorp are yearly SDK prices but I believe ESRI ARCGIS also has SDK costs. I am also aware that Esri is dominate in the defence sector from prior work experience, but this is not a market we are targeting. As to MapInfo I have no knowledge about the product other than its initial costs are low but upgrades amp  addons come at a high cost.p  pCan anyone give me a rundown of key points of these GIS providers, and feel free to includes others I have no listed.p  pemstrongEditemstrongp  pI am not looking for a recommendation for software to buy, has been be obtained from marketing information. I am seeking feedback from users who have experience with GIS software to share their knowledge about them, and thus bringing out the detail tha is otherwise unknown.

Negative 34777 pI have currently a block in my brain and cannot find the solution. I am not a good Java developer and this is about my university coursework. p  pBasically its a task to manage properties, and I am doing a much more complex solution than it is required. It is just the last bit where I struggle. p  pTo give you an idea of what we have  Properties superclass  PropertiesToLetextends Properties  PropertiesToSellextends Properties  EstateAgent GUI to manage the propertiesp  pSo the part I am struggling with is basically the EstateAgent class. p  pWhat I wrote so far a hrefhttppastebin.com0qieM67j relnofollowhttppastebin.com0qieM67jap  pThat a about 500 lines  But I need help with the theoretical part not the programming part  because I dont want you to do my coursework  I just need the solution how to approach that.p  pThe lines I am struggling with are from 55 to 113p  pIts about a table that I create and insert rows into it. Each row represents a property. It could be a propertyToLet or a propertyToSell object. Those properties come from my ArrayList properties. p  pThe inserting row and showing the table is fine and it is working the way it should. So there is problem with the code. I appologize for the code structure  but we are limited in the submission  so we cannot submit more than 4 files those file  are obviously the named classes  so I cannot extend any more classes or files to the project. p  pSo what I want to do now is Editing a property. p  pI have the row that represents a property. It is showing me the position in the arrayList and all the values that I can get. p  pSo now there are a few more possibilities.   Add and Remove a tenant from a PropertyToLet  base on a tenant you can collect the rent and pay the rent and see how much rent is left to pay.  Add and Remove a purchaser from a PropertyToSell the sold will then change according if there is a purchaser or notp  pSo basically there are several ways how to continue from here. For instance it could be a behaviour like this  RightClick on the property opens a context menu where the mouse is and I can choose other options such as Remove Tenant, Add Tenant, Collect Rent, Show Rent Owed, Add a purchaser, Remove a purchaser  ofcourse depending on what kind of property it is.p  ul liDouble click on a row  edit the property  have a look at this screenshotli ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY7JUb.png altenter image description here    it shows a window that I use to add a property  I could add all the values in the field and that button changes to Update Property p  pThat would be one solution another one would be  Edit the cell of the row  changes the value of the property they will inspect the object and see if that really changed and not just the row valuep  pThat are my ideas of how to inject the last steps of bringing the functionality into the application.p  pstrongSo here are my questionsstrongp  pAnd than I need an outside oppinion what is easier and faster to implement in this very limited task. The way of opening the exsisting add window and change it to an edit window  I dont want to have redundant code  Or changing the value by editing the cell so that the values in the arraylist change.p  pAgain my brain is just bit blocked and saw too much of this code. I need some help with the approach what is easier and what is better. p  pI really appreciate any help herep  pI am looking forward to see some answers.p  pstrongEDITstrong I finished the popup Menu thank you for your help.

Negative 34777 pI have written a WCF REST service .Net 4 to provide authenticatedauthorised access to Azure blobs. The basic behaviour isp  ol liClient makes a request to a hrefhttpserverblobauthorisationservicecontainerimage.jpg relnofollowhttpserverblobauthorisationservicecontainerimage.jpgali liService authenticates and authorises the request using authentication headersli liService generates a shared access signature for the blob indicated by containerimage.jpg using the secret key for the Azure storage accountli liService responds with a HTTP code 307 temporary redirect setting the redirect location to be the blob URI with the shared access signature appendedli liClient accesses the blobli ol  pThe service has a GET method for reads and a PUT for createsupdates. The idea is that the client can access the blobs or local files in very similar ways using a stream. For files, the stream is a FileStream and for blobs it is the response stream from an HttpWebRequest. It is very simple to create the HttpWebRequest and the redirect behaviour works transparently by setting AllowAutoRedirect  true on the request object. All very HTTP friendly.p  pThe GET method works perfectly, but there is a problem for the PUT. The procedure basically works, but the entire content of the blob is sent to my service in the message body, even though it doesnt need it. Then after the redirect, it is sent emagainem, this time to Azure. Obviously this is inefficient, especially for large blobs.p  pThe client does not initially send the body because it sets the Expect header to be 100Continue. This is normal HTTP behaviour and as I understand it, it is specifically designed for cases like this, where the request might be redirected or denied based on the headers.p  pBut in my case something either WCF or IIS I guess sends the 100Continue before any of my service code is executed, causing the client to send the message body to my service unnecessarily. I can observe this behaviour using a network monitor tool.p  pSo, my question is Is it possible to somehow prevent the 100Continue response being sent, so my service can operate just on the request headers as intendedp

Negative 34777 pIs there a quick and easy way to make a VB.NET user interface for managing the data in a normalized DataSetp  pI know that is a very subjective question, so let me explain. For a brief period early in my career, I used to create user interfaces in Microsoft Access. I developed a simple, but very effective approach to user interface design. Here are some details of that approachp  ul liCreate one form per table. Put on each form all controls necessary to completely manage one row in the table.li liUse combo boxes for foreignkey columns.li liGive the user a standard way to add rows and delete rows.li liUse Apply and Undo buttons.li liLet the user navigate from one row to another with a list box.li liProvide a search box and filter options for more efficient navigation.li liLet the user doubleclick on controls representing foreignkey columns to quickly navigate from one form to another.li liMake the state of each form persistent so the user always returns to the last navigation pointli lietc.li ul  pSimple, right I found that Access encouraged this approach. It has many builtin features that make this kind of UI easy. For instance, creating a combo box to represent a foreign key relationship takes about 10 seconds.p  pWell, I havent worked in Access for a while. A couple of years ago, however, I was hired to write an application in VB.NET on the NET 2.0 framework. To get a data management user interface up and running quickly, I used my Access experience to write a quick amp easy prototype in Access  that took me about one week. Then I hired a programmer to implement that same UI in VB.NET. What a nightmare Weve been working on that implementation for a year, and Im still very unsatisfied with the results. Some of the problems we are havingp  ul liApply and Undo buttons dont work quite right. We cant find an event that tells us when the form is dirty thus making Apply and Undo relevant.li liNavigation from row to row and from form to form requires surprisingly complicated code. I get the impression that we are fighting against NETs binding features, not working with them the way they were intended to be used.li liThe NET controls seem buggy. For instance, when the user types a value into a combo box as opposed to choosing it from the drop down, it doesnt trigger the SelectedValueChanged event.li liWe seem to be repeating a lot of information. For instance, the DataSet knows there is a relationship between the columns in two tables, but we must nevertheless effectively repeat the details of that relationship when we program the combo boxes, binding, navigtation features, etc.li liWe still dont have good solutions for the filter and search features. There are lots of little details to work out. For instance, what if you choose a filter that doesnt include the currently displayed rowli liWe are writing many helper functions and classes to simplify the work, and I cant figure out why that effort hasnt already been done by others  Im certain we are reinventing the wheel.li lietc.li ul  pBy themselves, none of the above are a big deal  there are effective solutions to each one. Taken together, however, these problems are making my UI development go much slower than expected.p  pIn an ideal world, I should be able to create a small amount of code relevant to my specific data model for instance, one user control per table establishing the layout and logic relevant to the rows in that table then integrate that code into a template which interprets the data model and handles everything else  navigation, adding and deleting, apply and undo, search and filter, etc.p  pThus, my question Is there anything out there which makes this type of UI development easierp  pIve searched the web for various combinations of generic forms, UI templates, data managment forms, etc., but I havent found anything on topic. Perhaps I just dont know the buzzwords. Is there a specific name for this type of UI development taskp

Negative 34777 pOK my first question so here goes.p  pCurrently users are using a huge Access Application. They wanted a web application with some functionality based off of the Access data and with some modifications.p  pOk no problem. I used the Access to SQL migration assistant to convert the data over and then wrote some SSIS packages which are executed from the web end to allow the application to be updated as needed. All here is good.p  pHere is where I am kind of stumped. There are 2 types of imports, quarterly and yearly. The quarterly is fine but the yearly import is causing issues. The yearly import can be for an adopted budget or for a proposed budget each is held in a separate Access db. I have one SSIS package for each type of yearly import. The table where the information goes is as follows..p  precodeCREATE TABLE Budget      BudgetID           uniqueidentifier NOT NULL,     ProjectNumber      int NOT NULL,     SubProjectNumber   varchar6 NOT NULL,     FiscalYearBegin    int NOT NULL,     FiscalYearEnd      int NOT NULL,     Sequence           int NULL,     QuarterImportDate  datetime NULL,     ProposedBudget     money NULL,     AdoptedBudget      money NULL,      CONSTRAINT PKBudget PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED               BudgetID ASC     ,      CONSTRAINT ucBudget UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED               ProjectNumber ASC,         SubProjectNumber ASC,         FiscalYearBegin ASC,         FiscalYearEnd ASC,         Sequence ASC       codepre  pAlso, there can be multiple versions of the budget for the specific year in terms of codeProjectcode, codeSubProjectcode, codeFiscalYearBegincode, and codeFiscalYearEndcode. Thats is why there is a sequence number.p  pSo the problem becomes, since I have 2 different SSIS packages, each of which is an update statement on 1 specific column either codeProposedBudgetcode or codeAdoptedBudgetcode, I have no effective way of keeping track of the correct sequence.p  pPlease let me know if I can make this any clearer, and any advice would be greatp  pThanks.p
Negative 34777 pI have been trying to find a good solution googling around and i am having little success on my current project to implement custom paging and Sorting on an ASp GridView Control .NET 4.0.p  pThis is the most current site i have attempted to use as a base to complete this task a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBwebformsGridViewCustomPaging.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBwebformsGridViewCustomPaging.aspxap  pThe biggest problem i have with this solution is that his example FirstID is an integer also his ProductID and I am using GUIDs as my uniqueidentifier. This is obviously causing issues when I try to order by this or anything like that. I tried using another colum AesExt varchar50  but that is not working either, basically, it keeps saving the top row row for some reason. I also need to implement sorting, so when i get the procedure back in C, I am stuffing it into a Datatable and using DataView to do the sorting. I was wondering if anyone out there had a better solution for this scenario they could share or show me what I am doing in correctly. I was also trying to find a good way to do the sorting in the procedure, but it wont work because my boss wanted extension as varchar50 because there are none entries personally i think it should be 0. So when I try to sort by AesExt, when i want to convert to int so the sort works right, it will blow up at none and i know looping in a procedure is a no no, so Im stuck doing that in C code I think.p  pStore procedurep  precodeUSE [Inventory] GO  Object  StoredProcedure [dbo].[uspGetExtList]    Script Date 06262011 210706  SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO    Author      ltAuthor,,Namegt  Create date ltCreate Date,,gt  Description ltDescription,,gt   ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[uspGetExtList]      Add the parameters for the stored procedure here startRowIndex INT, maximumRows INT,  sortExpression AS VARCHAR50, sortDirection AS VARCHAR50, totalRows INT OUTPUT  AS  DECLARE firstid INT DECLARE startRow INT  SET startRowIndex   startRowIndex  1   maximumRows 1  IF startRowIndex  1  SET startRowIndex  1   SET ROWCOUNT startRowIndex  SELECT firstid  AesExt FROM ExtItem   PRINT firstid SET ROWCOUNT maximumRows  SELECT ExtensionGUID, AesExt,Name FROM ExtItem WHERE  AesExt gt firstid  ORDER BY CASE WHEN sortExpression Name AND sortDirection  Ascending THEN Name                 END ASC,          CASE WHEN sortExpression  Name AND sortDirectionDescending THEN Name                 END DESC,          CASE WHEN sortExpression  AesExt AND sortDirection  Ascending THEN AesExt                 END ASC,          CASE WHEN sortExpression  AesExt AND sortDirectionDescending THEN AesExt                 END DESC,          CASE WHEN sortExpression  AgentExt AND sortDirection  Ascending THEN AgentExt                 END ASC,          CASE WHEN sortExpression  AgentExt AND sortDirectionDescending THEN AgentExt                 END DESC         SET ROWCOUNT 0 codepre  p Get the total rows p  precodeSELECT totalRows  COUNTExtensionGUID FROM Extitem codepre  pC Codep  precode protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              if IsPostBack             BindData           region BIND DATA      private void BindData              string connectionString  ServerlocalhostSQLEXPRESS  DatabaseInventoryTrustedConnectiontrue          SqlConnection myConnection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString         SqlCommand myCommand  new SqlCommanduspGetExtList, myConnection          myCommand.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure          myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuestartRowIndex, currentPageNumber         myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuemaximumRows, PAGESIZE         myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuesortExpression, SortExpression         myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuesortDirection, GridViewSortDirection         myCommand.Parameters.AddtotalRows, SqlDbType.Int, 4         myCommand.Parameters[totalRows].Direction                             ParameterDirection.Output          SqlDataAdapter sqlDataAdapter  new SqlDataAdaptermyCommand          DataSet ds  new DataSet         ad.Fillds         DataTable dataTable  new DataTable         sqlDataAdapter.FilldataTable          DataView dataView  new DataViewdataTable         dataView.Sort  AesExt ASC         gvProducts.DataSource  dataView         gvProducts.DataBind           get the total rows          double totalRows  intmyCommand.Parameters[totalRows].Value          lblTotalPages.Text  CalculateTotalPagestotalRows.ToString          lblCurrentPage.Text  currentPageNumber.ToString          if currentPageNumber  1                      BtnPrevious.Enabled  false              if Int32.ParselblTotalPages.Text gt 0                              BtnNext.Enabled  true                          else                 BtnNext.Enabled  false                    else                      BtnPrevious.Enabled  true              if currentPageNumber  Int32.ParselblTotalPages.Text                 BtnNext.Enabled  false             else BtnNext.Enabled  true               codepre  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

That is all I can think of.p  pThanks much.p  pstrongEDITstrong I found out in a hrefhttpaspadvice.comblogsssmitharchive20080215StoredProcedurePerformanceVariesBetweenADO.NETandManagementStudio.aspxthis linka that ADO.NET sets codeARITHABORTcode to true  which is good for most of the time but sometime this happens, and the suggested workaround is to add codewith recompilecode option to the stored proc. In my case, its not working but I suspect its something very similar to this. Anyone knows what else ADO.NET does or where I can find the spec thanks.p

Negative 34777 pJavaScript converts operands to 32bit signed ints before doing bitwise operations.

Negative 34777 pIve uploaded a VS2010 project at the below location. This test app should be run once you have a full screen application running. As soon as its running, you have 2 seconds to click back on your fullscreen application. It creates 2 modeless dialog boxes using the full screen application which should be the last window to have focus as the owner of the dialog boxes. One dialog is displayed, hidden, the second dialog is displayed, hidden and then the first dialog is displayed again in a cycle. What I find is that when the first dialog box is displayed for the second time, the taskbar pops up. Ive spent 4 painful days trying to understand whats going on here and I am desperate for some help.p  pI received some help which suggested that when I call DestroyWindow to hide the dialogs, Windows would put focus somewhere  and in my case the taskbar. Previously when I asked this question I wasnt using the full screen application as the Owner of my windows. I would have thought that the focus should go back to the owner window I have also tried calling SetFocus and SetForegroundWindow on the full screen application prior to calling DestroyWindow on my dialog  but the seems to cause the taskbar to appear everytime and I dont want that at all.p  pPlease helpp  pa hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comiky0wqb816i7bir relnofollowSample VS2010 Projectap

Simple things faking a 500 response etc, and making the ajax calls take much longer.p  pFor the asynchronous calls, its simple. When the real response comes back, add a codesetTimeoutcode to make it wait for the artificial response time before triggering the callback. However, this doesnt work with the synchronous calls obviously, since codesetTimeoutcode isnt synchronous.p  pSo, is there a way to make a Javascript program perform a blocking wait for a set amount of timep  pThe only thing I could think of would be something like thisp  precodefunction waitms      var start  new Date     while new Date  start lt ms  codepre  pIs there a better solutionp  pemAlso, please assume theres a good reason for the blocking ajax calls... codecodeemp

Negative 34777 pIm having a couple issues with the Input element in a Webkit Android App im developing. Testing on 2.X, but 3.x doesnt seem to have these issues...p  pThe app works by having separate Divs for each page, and Im using CSS3 translate3D to animate between the pages. Some of those pages include Input elements. When I tap on the input to gain focus, any of my positionfixed Divs will shift about 5px from the top, and 5px left. Now the kicker... it will eventually fix itself, and then never happen again when you tap on an input, its only that first time...p  pMy other problem, the Input elements are screwy with keyboards, for instance, spell correctionsautocomplete will not input text, and when using Swype Keyboard, you cant swipe the word, ONLY individual taps for each letter will input text into the Input element.p  pIve read that a lot of these might be caused by CSS3 Translate3D. But, Ive tried just about everything to fix these issues, and Ive searched just about every site for a solution, but havent been able to find a fix, or find anyone else with this issue...p  pDoes anyone else have these issues, or know of a fixp  pPossible solution Anyone know of a way to override the default behavior of Input elements in the webkit I wonder if I can generate my own TextView and position it over these input fields...p  pAny help is greatly appreciated p

Negative 34777 pI had some discussion related to the use of properties and instance variables at work, therefore I would like to find a wiki answer for that. Now, I know theres no real private member type in objectivec, everything is pretty much public. However, Im a little bit concerned about the way we should design our classes and also to comply to OOP principles. I would like to hear opinions of these three design approaches p  pA. According to various post and even to a new Stanford university iPhone development courses, you should always use properties everywhere you can. However IMHO, this approach brakes OOP design principles because in this case, all members become public. Why do I need to publish all my internallocal instance variables to outside Also, theres some very little but still overhead if you use synthesized setters via properties, instead using local ivar directly. Heres a samplep  precode header file  interface MyClass  NSObject  property nonatomic, retain NSString publicMemberWithProperty property nonatomic, retain NSString propertyForPrivateMember  end codepre  pB. Another approach is to declare ivars in header file without declaring relative properties for private members, and in the same header file, to declare pure properties without declaring relative ivars for public members. In such case, ivars would be used directly in the class. This approach makes sense but not uses all benefits from properties because we have manually to release old values before setting the new ones. Heres a samplep  precode header file  interface MyClass  NSObject   NSString privateMember   property nonatomic, retain NSString publicMemberWithProperty  end codepre  pC. To declare pure properties without declaring relative ivars for public members in header file, and to declare pure properties without declaring relative ivars for private members in private interface in implementation file. This approach IMHO is more clear than the first one, but the same question remains why do we have to have properties for internallocal members Heres a samplep  precode header file  interface MyClass  NSObject  property nonatomic, retain NSString publicMemberWithProperty  end   implementation file  interface MyClass  property nonatomic, retain NSString propertyForPrivateMember  end codepre  pThis decision freedom annoys me a little bit and I would like to find a confirmation from respective sources about how things should be done. However, I was unable to find such strict statements in Apple docs on that, so please post a link to apple docs if any exists, or to any other theory that clears that.   p

The file will be stored in a MEDIUMBLOB field of a table in a MySQL database.p  pTo do this, the content of the uploaded file needs to be read, then inserted.

Negative 34777 pMy problem is that I recently started to change my HTML5 webapp to use fullscreen  pointer lock instead of dragging the mouse in the window. The app uses keyboard in addition to mouse, and everything was working fine previously. However, now I cant get any kind of keypresses to work. Pointer locked mouse works perfectly.p  pPreviously I listened to keypresses like thisp  precodedocument.onkeydown  handleKeyDown document.onkeyup  handleKeyUp codepre  pwhere handleKeyDown and Up are functions, for examplep  precodefunction handleKeyUpevent      doStuffWithevent.keyCode  codepre  pNow, I have added keyboard listeners right next to my mousemove listenerp  precodedocument.addEventListenerkeyup, handleKeyUpevent, false document.addEventListenerkeydown, handleKeyDownevent, false codepre  pwhere handleKey are the same as above, but doStuffWith doesnt do anything. It seems to get some undefined events and nothing else. This is probably a fairly elementary problem, but I have a hard time solving it. Most examples and tutorials I found with Google dont use addEventListener but instead the old style like I used previously.p  pI am very grateful for any help.p  pedit  A clarification since events are undefined, doStuffWith doesnt get called at all, because the execution stops when trying to read .keyCode of undefinedp

Negative 34777 pI am building an iphone application.p  pI have a tabbarcontroller that has 2 tab items.  Each tabitem links to a different navigationcontroller.  Each navigationcontroller links to a hierarchy of tableviewcontrollers. When a user clicks on tab 1, then clicks on an item in the table, then clicks tab 2, and then clicks on tab1, the application shows the table that he was just looking at before he clicked on tab2.p  pHow do i get the app to show the first table of tab 1 every time he clicks on tab 1 instead of showing the most recent table he was looking at before leaving tab1p  pI would prefer a programmatic solution as opposed to using xcode storyboard.  But if none exists, then storyboard solution is fine too.p
Negative 34777 pI have a problem which is hard to explain so lets get startedp  pContext I have a application running on a tomcat server Lets call it admin. The admin have an importexport function. Our own application is an extension to that and we need to gather some information when the admin apps use the importexport function. p  pProblem The third party jar that contain the class ImportController is located there codesomeFolderadminWEBINFlibadmin.jarcode. The goal is to gather the Old project ID and the new Project ID so that our extension can link our class to the right project. Since i know the method signature i though i could use AOP to do so.p  pIdea The idea i came with is to put something like codeidHiJacker.jarcode that would contain a single pointcut and advice into the codesomeFolderadminWEBINFlibcode and enable loadtime weaving. That advice would simply put the information into an xml file so our extension would be able to read it when we want to put the link back after a project import.p  pAlso i must say Im a pure newbie with AOP and web stuff. But i do not wish to import a monster for just doing this small operation with AOP.

Check the comments to find out.p  pThe issue Im having now is that when I set the initial camera position and rotation and controls.update runs, it changes the rotational z axis even though I havent moved the camera.p  pHere is the entirety of my codep  precodevar camera, scene, renderer, geometry, material, mesh, flatrect var radius  50,     segments  16,     rings  16,     WIDTH  800,     HEIGHT  800,     VIEWANGLE  40,     ASPECT  WIDTH  HEIGHT,     NEAR  1,     FAR  5000   var animation  true var animatewidth  false var playblock0 var array  [.289, .342, .396, .451, .508, .568, .630, .697, .771, .857, 1], index  0 var myloop, myloop2 var zcamera1000  How far the camera is away from the object var mouseoncontainerfalse  var sliderx, slidery, sliderz function animatemain     animaterectplayblock     ifplayblocklt11     setTimeoutfunctionanimatemain,100       document.readyfunction          container.mouseenterfunction                           container.mousedownfunction                 mouseoncontainer  true                                       container.mouseleavefunction         mouseoncontainerfalse                   init         animate          stopanim.clickfunction         animationfalse                   animatewidth.clickfunction             playblock0             animatemain                    function init          scene  new THREE.Scene          camera  new THREE.PerspectiveCameraVIEWANGLE, ASPECT, NEAR, FAR          camera.position.z  zcamera          scene.addcamera           geometry  new THREE.CylinderGeometry200,200,500,100         material  new THREE.MeshNormalMaterialcolor 0x0000ee, opacity.5, wireframetrue          geometry1  new THREE.CubeGeometry1, 500, array[0]400         material1  new THREE.MeshNormalMaterialcolor0x000000           lights up everything         var ambientLight  new THREE.AmbientLight 0x00ff00           scene.addambientLight                 mesh  new THREE.Meshgeometry, material         flatrect  new THREE.Meshgeometry1, material1         flatrect.position.x200Math.sqrt1Math.powarray[0],2          controls  new THREE.TrackballControlscamera         controls.rotatespeed  50.0         controls.zoomSpeed  5.0         controls.panSpeed  0.8         controls.noZoom  false         controls.noPan  true         controls.staticMoving  true         controls.dynamicDampingFactor  0.3         controls.keys  [65, 83, 68]                     scene.addmesh         scene.addflatrect         controls.update         camera.position.set224,1003,684         camera.rotation.set2.1692,0.1824, 1.8839         renderer  new THREE.WebGLRenderer antialias true           renderer.setSize WIDTH, HEIGHT          container.html renderer.domElement          render              function animate             window.requestAnimationFrame animate                   blabber.htmlThe x position is camera.position.x                     ltbrgtThe y position is camera.position.y                     ltbrgtThe z position is camera.position.z                     ltbrgtThe x rotation is camera.rotation.x                     ltbrgtThe y rotation is camera.rotation.y                     ltbrgtThe z rotation is camera.rotation.z         render                   function animaterectindexed         scene.removeflatrect         geometry1  new THREE.CubeGeometry1, 500, array[indexed]400                  material1  new THREE.MeshNormalMaterialcolor0x000000         flatrect  new THREE.Meshgeometry1, material1         flatrect.position.x200Math.sqrt1Math.powarray[indexed],2          scene.addflatrect         blabber.appendflatrect.scale.get         render               function render          ifmouseoncontainertrue         controls.update         renderer.render scene, camera       ltbodygt     ltdiv idcontainer stylewidth800pxheight800pxgt       ltdivgt     ltbutton idstopanim typeinputgtStop animationltbuttongt     ltbutton idanimatewidth typeinputgtAnimate Widthltbuttongt     ltdiv idblabbergt           ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pEdit 1 Here is the jsfiddle link. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJ2NEB240 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJ2NEB240ap

Negative 34777 pThis is a bit embarrassing but its been a while.p  pWhen working with relational databases and linking to separate tables by primaryforeign keys, in 1, such that, in a particular table, the tables foreign relationship returns an integer ID... how do you go about making this relationship intelligible to usersp  pFor examplep  pYou have a strongcompanystrong tablep  ul liCIDli liCompanyNameli liCompanyLocationli liCompanyBusinessTypeli ul  petc not actual column namesp  pand an strongemployeestrong tablep  ul liEIDli lifirstNameli lisurNameli liDOBli liemailli licompanyli ul  pEmployee emcompanyem is related to CID. But some user putting in information about an employee would have to know the ID code for the particular company due to the nature of the relationship. You can run a query to return CompanyNames along with their associated CIDs which can then be searched, but this cipher is hardly an ideal solution. I just cannot remember the theory of how one approaches this, even though Im certain Ive done it before. I need to implement it in both Microsoft Access 2010 and Microsoft SSMS separate databases fwiw but the execution should be relatively straightforward as soon as I remember how its donep

Negative 34777 pI am working on a project involving contact synchronization between Outlook and SharePoint.

Negative 34777 pThere is an array which can contain, say, upto code1000code elements. The range of numbers it can spawn is say code1 to 1010code. Now I have to find the codeminimal absolute differencecode between two numbers in the array. I have thought of two algorithms p  pstrongFor the first onestrong, I have defined a codebinarysearchcode function which finds the position of a tobeinserted number in a sorted array. Now I start the sorted array with only the first number of the given array and begin iterating on the given array from the second element onwards. For each number, I find its position in the sorted array. If the number at that position is this number, then the difference is 0, it is the lowest possible one, so I exit the loop. Else, I insert the number in the sorted array at that point, then check the difference between that number and the previous and next numbers in that array. Then I store the minimum of this result and the previous result, and continue in this fashion.p  pstrongSecond I sort the array using quicksortstrong. The range is too large, so I think radix sort wont be that efficient. Then I iterate over it, breaking out with an answer of 0 if two consecutive numbers are equal, else storing the minimum of the difference between that number and the previous number and the previous result.p  pstrongWhich one will be more efficientstrongp  pstrongIs there any better algostrong p  pStackoverflow has a number of posts in this regard, but they didnt help much.

Negative 34777 pIm using ElasticSearch along with the tire gem to power the search functionality of my site.

This is what doesnt feel right and where my questions originate.p  pI have a large catalog of products, each with a handful of traits such as emcolorem, emmaterialem and embrandem. Since these traits are so varied, I modeled the data to include a Trait model which relates to the Product model via a ProductTrait model, which holds the value of the trait for the given product.p  pstrongFirst question isstrong How can i create the elasticsearch mapping to index these traits properly I assume that this involves a nested type but I cant make enough sense of the docs to figure it out.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong I want the facets to come back in groups in the manner that I am processing them at the end of the codesearchcode method above but with counts that reflect how many matches there are emwithout taking into account the currently selected value for each trait.em For example If the user searches for Glitter and then clicks the link corresponding to the Blue Color facet, I want all the Color facets to remain visible and show counts correspinding the query results emwithoutem the Blue Color filter. I hope that is a good explanation, sorry if it needs more clarification.p

Negative 34777 pI have a little problem and dont know where to start.p  pI need to make a subscribtion service and if returns unique address on which consumer will send soaps after subscription. It works like so  you send a SOAP on address a hrefhttpfoo.orgSubscribe relnofollowhttpfoo.orgSubscribea and in response you get address a hrefhttpfoo.orgSubscriptionManager1 relnofollowhttpfoo.orgSubscriptionManager1a, the next consumer will get a hrefhttpfoo.orgSubscriptionManager2 relnofollowhttpfoo.orgSubscriptionManager2a etc. p  pHow can i emplement that via WCF I guesed that WCF have something like ASP.Net Routing, where i could route links like  a hrefhttpfoo.orgSubscriptionManager relnofollowhttpfoo.orgSubscriptionManagera and access 2 as a parameter, but i havent found something like that.p  pI look forward to any help.p

Negative 34777 pI am trying to configure Apache to allow .htaccess Rewrite rules. I am using XAMPP to run Apache locally. However, I keep getting 500 errors.

It contains the      configuration directives that give the server its instructions.      See  for detailed information.      In particular, see             for a discussion of each configuration directive.           Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding      what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure      consult the online docs. You have been warned.             Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many      of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the      server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin      with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsfoo.log      with ServerRoot set to xamppapache will be interpreted by the      server as xamppapachelogsfoo.log.           NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes      instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.      If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located      will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply      an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.            ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers      configuration, error, and log files are kept.           Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point      ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive      at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple      httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.          ServerRoot xamppapache            Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor      ports, instead of the default. See also the       directive.           Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to       prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.      It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for      running httpd, as with most system services.          User daemon     Group daemon                  Main server configuration           The directives in this section set up the values used by the main      server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a       definition.  These values also provide defaults for      any  containers you may define later in the file.           All of these directives may appear inside  containers,      in which case these default settings will be overridden for the      virtual host being defined.                 ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be      emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such      as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com          ServerAdmin postmasterlocalhost            ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.      This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify      it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.           If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.          ServerName localhost80            DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your      documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but      symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.          DocumentRoot xampphtdocs            Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect      to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that      directory and its subdirectories.            First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of       features.                     AllowOverride All         Require all granted             XAMPP We disable operating system specific optimizations for a listening       socket by the http protocol here. IE 64 bit make problems without this.       AcceptFilter http none            Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow      particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as      you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it      below.                 This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.                             Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,          or any combination of            Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews                   Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All          doesnt give it to you.                   The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see          httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmloptions          for more information.                  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI                    AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.          It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords            Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit                  AllowOverride All                    Controls who can get stuff from this server.                  Require all granted                  DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory      is requested.                   DirectoryIndex index.php index.pl index.cgi index.asp index.shtml index.html index.htm                         default.php default.pl default.cgi default.asp default.shtml default.html default.htm                         home.php home.pl home.cgi home.asp home.shtml home.html home.htm                 The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being       viewed by Web clients.                    Require all denied                 ErrorLog The location of the error log file.      If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a       container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be      logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a       container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.          ErrorLog logserror.log      ScriptLog logscgi.log            LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.      Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,      alert, emerg.          LogLevel warn                         The following directives define some format nicknames for use with          a CustomLog directive see below.                  LogFormat h l u t r s b Refereri UserAgenti combined         LogFormat h l u t r s b common                      You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O           LogFormat h l u t r s b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio                             The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.          If you do not define any access logfiles within a           container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do          define per access logfiles, transactions will be          logged therein and not in this file.                  CustomLog logsaccess.log common                    If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information          Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.                  CustomLog logsaccess.log combined                              Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to           exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client           will make a new request for the document at its new location.          Example          Redirect permanent foo httplocalhostbar                    Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to          access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.          Example          Alias webpath fullfilesystempath                   If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will          require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely          need to provide a  section to allow access to          the filesystem path.                    ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.           ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that          documents in the target directory are treated as applications and          run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the          client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias          directives as to Alias.                  ScriptAlias cgibin xamppcgibin                               ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX          socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.                  Scriptsock logscgi.sock                 xamppcgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased      CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.                   AllowOverride All         Options None         Require all granted                               TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from          filename extension to MIMEtype.                  TypesConfig confmime.types                    AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration          file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.                  AddType applicationxgzip .tgz                   AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress          information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.                  AddEncoding xcompress .Z         AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz                   If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you          probably should define those extensions to indicate media types                  AddType applicationxcompress .Z         AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz                    AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers          actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server          or added with the Action directive see below                   To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories          You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.                  AddHandler cgiscript .cgi .pl .asp           For type maps negotiated resources         AddHandler typemap var                    Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.                   To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI          You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.                  AddType texthtml .shtml         AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml                              The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the          contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile          directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.                  MIMEMagicFile confmagic                 Customizable error responses come in three flavors      1 plain text 2 local redirects 3 external redirects           Some examples     ErrorDocument 500 The server made a boo boo.

Negative 34777 pI am working through a section of a text on determining complexity of nested loops using recurrence relations. In this particular example I am trying to determine how many times the count variable will be incremented as a function of n.p  pThis is the loop I am analyzing p  precodefor int i  1 i lt n i       int j  n      while j gt 0             count            j  j  2        codepre  pI think I understand that the first line would equate simply to n since it only executes for each value of n but its the rest of it that Im having trouble with. I think the answer would be something like nn2 except that this example is using integer division so Im not sure how to represent that mathematically. p  pIve run through the loop by hand a few times on paper so I know that the count variable should equal 1, 4, 6, 12, 15, and 18 for n values of 16. I just cant seem to come up with the formula... Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

When I press T. pydev gives me some completion hints. It includes one method fun1. Thats good. Then, when I do that for second time, pydev gives me two choices. A method, as before, and something called fun1 with no parentheses, just plain name with simple white circle icon. I couldnt find what does the icon mean nor meaning of any other icon, to be honest and a way to disable the second autocompletion, as useless in my case.

Negative 34777 pI have 10 codeaspPanelcodes that include a fieldset with codeasplabelscode and codeasptextboxescode in order to retrieve the data of contact details for a company. I would like to add and delete panelscontact details fieldset and I have followed the following approach to solve my problem. p  pAt the beginning I have these 10 panels, and only 1 panel is Visible, the remaining 9 are InVisible. When the user desires to add a new contact the following panel changes to codeVisible  truecode. Same approach is followed for the deletion of this particular panelcontact details fieldset, I put the particular codepanel.Visible  falsecode and all its fields clear.p  pSince the company is able to retrieve for maximum 10 contacts their details  translate to 10 panels, my problem arises when the user desires after a while to add a new panel after deletion. p  pFor example, the user adds codePanel 1code  codePanel 2code  codePanel 3code for three contacts. Then he deletes codePanel 1code and thereafter he desires to add another Panel. Then my program finds how many panels are available yet codevisible falsecode in order to create the next Panel  since max Panels  10, however based on the above scenario my program creates codePanel 1code again at the same position like the page load  to wit above codePanel 2code, but if codePanel 4code is the following available will create it down of codePanel 3code and this causes confusion to the user. The new Panel is created above or down of the last Panel depending on the rest of available panels if the number of following panel is smaller or bigger of the last. p  pHow can I fix my problem or am I following a completely wrong approach I tried to use JavaScript to add new controls but I found many difficulties to recognize the IDs of each controller in order to store the data to my Database.p

Negative 34777 pI have an HTML5jQuery Mobile app that I am developing with PhoneGap. I have deployed this app to iOS successfully and am now porting it to Android.p  pI have run into some strange behaviour when testing this app on my Android device, which is a Samsung Galaxy S2 running Ice Cream Sandwich.p  pI have a list of elements contained within a div, and that div has a fixed height. It also uses the CSS property overflowy scroll to allow the mobile user to scroll through the list. The list contains anchor links. Like thisp  precodeltdiv styledisplay block width 320px height 250px overflowy scrollgt     lta hrefindex1.htmlgtLink 1ltagt     lta hrefindex2.htmlgtLink 2ltagt     lta hrefindex3.htmlgtLink 3ltagt     lta hrefindex4.htmlgtLink 4ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pWhen the list of anchor links is emstill within the standard height of the boxem i.e. if the list only has a few elements, it works fine. You can tap on the links and they function as expected. However, when the list of links emexpands beyond the height of the boxem and overflowy scrolling takes effect, I can no longer tap on the links. The scrolling works perfectly, but I cant tap on any of the elements within the scrolling divp  pOddly, something else I cannot do with any of the links is select them using the browsers text selection capabilities. Its possible when there are too few links for scrolling, but not possible when the scrolling is active.p  pI had assumed that a Galaxy S2 with ICS would be new enough to properly support overflowy scrolling but perhaps Im wrong. Any idea on how I can get this to work I cant seem to find anything specific online in regard to bugs or support for overflowy in Ice Cream Sandwich.p

Negative 34777 pIm experiencing a 500, Internal Server error on my website. The error logs show the following error Premature end of script headers cgiwrapper, in my Joomla application.p  pIt only occurs when one particular file is loaded. The rest of the applicationwebsite works as it should. There are no other related issues that show up in the error logs  no indication of a timeout or a permissions error.p  pThe file that is causing the error is a templatelayout file. Furthermore, I have identified a snippet of code that will cause the error, when this is commented out, the site loads just fine. Here it isp  precode    if questiongttype  1  questiongttype  2  questiongttype  3               shuffle items         shuffleditems  thisgtshuffleassocitems         output           output . lttable classanswertablegt         output . lttrgt         output . lttdgt         output . ltul classanswersgt          foreachshuffleditems as item                      output . ltli num . itemgtnum . gt             output . itemgtitem             output . ltligt                   output . ltulgt         output . lttdgt         output . lttrgt         output . lttablegt          output . lttable classanswertable correctanswer styledisplay nonegt         output . lttrgt         output . lttdgt         output . ltp classquestioninstructionsgtCorrect Answerltpgt         output . ltul classanswers correctanswergt          foreachitems as item                      output . ltli num . itemgtnum . gt             output . itemgtitem             output . ltligt                   output . ltulgt         output . lttdgt         output . lttablegt          echo output      codepre  pIt uses a variable, questions, that is set in the view.html.php file for those who know Joomla. It is this variable that seems to be triggering the error. If I dont assign the questions variable, then the template will load just fine.p  pAlso, in the example above, it first tests the question type questiontype. There are other sections of code that would be triggered, and still produce the error, if questiontype is not 1, 2, or 3. But I left out the other code for brevity, and because it only gets called when the relevant question type exists. When the code above alone gets run, it causes the error.p  pSo, Im lost here. What baffles me is that only this template file, and the questions variable causes the error. Everything else works fine. It also runs fine on my local server.p  pAlmost forgot, using Joomla 1.5.22, PHP 5.3.3, Apache 2.2.3, Cent OS 5.8. The server also runs Parallels Plesk Panel 10.p  pI hope someone can point me to a solution.p  pThanksp

Negative 34777 pI might be breaking the rules with this, but for my 960 grid system, I have a few columns that I add a rightborder style to them. This has the effect of making that column 1px too large. Thus, if I have a full set of columns, the one on the far right overflows into the next row. This is obviously not desirable. p  pI fixed this by manually reducing the columns width by the same thickness as the border  1px. This has worked wonderfully. p  pThe problem is that I just did a demo of my site to a colleague and when they pulled up the site, there were still overflow issues. Columns that looked fine on my computer  a Mac in Chrome, Firefox and Safari had the overflow issue on their Firefox browser running Windows 7. I tried remoting into a Windows box in their office and viewing the site in Firefox and it works fine. p  pMy question is how do I go about ensuring that what looks right on my computer will look right on someone elses How is it possible that the same site viewed in the same browser on two different machines both running Windows 7 p

Negative 34777 h2Backgroundh2  pIm working on a portfolio website, the website is fairly simple, the bulk of the work is on the gallery.

Like I said, this just seems wrong. p  pThe only other suggestion to improve this that Ive had is to use the entity manager in the gallery entity to get images within the entity, this of course would defeat the very purpose that Doctrine is meant to be used for. p  hr  h2Conclusionh2  pIn conclusion, how do I do this better There must be a place to do this better and Im just new to Symfony. Looking over the documentation hasnt helped...p  hr  h2Additional Detailsh2  pI forgot to mention, the ability to still be able to use the entities is a necessity, I have some methods on the entities that are used later on.

Negative 34777 pIm currently doing live testing of a game Im making for Android. The services are written in rails 3.1 and Im using Postgresql. Some of my more technically savvy testers have been able to manipulate the game by recording their requests to the server and replaying them with high concurrency. Ill try to briefly describe the scenario below without getting caught up in the code.p  ul liA user can purchase multiple items, each item has its own record in the database.li liThe request goes to a controller action, which creates a purchase model to record information about the transaction.li liThe trade model has a method that sets up the purchase of the items. It essentially does a few logical steps to see if they can purchase the item. The most important is that they have a limit of 100 items per user at any given time. If all the conditions pass, a simple loop is used to create the number of items they requested.li ul  pSo, what they are doing is, recording 1 valid request purchase via a proxy. Then replaying it with high concurrency, which essentially is allowing a few extra to slip through each time. So if they set it to purchase 100 quantity, they can get it up to 300400 or if they do 15 quantity, they can get it up to like 120.p  pThe above purchase method is wrapped in a transaction. However, even though its wrapped it wont stop it in certain circumstances where the requests are executing nearly at the same time. Im guessing this may require some DB locking. Another twist in this that needs to be known is that at any given time rake task are being ran in cron jobs against the user table to update the players health and energy attributes. So, that cannot be blocked either.p  pAny assistance would be really awesome. This is my little hobby side project and I want to make sure the game is fair and fun for everyone.p  pThanks so muchp  pController actionp  precode  def hire     workerassettypeid  params[workerassettypeid]     quantity  params[quantity]      trade  Trade.new      traderesponse  trade.buyworkerassetcurrentuser, workerassettypeid, quantity      user  User.findcurrentuser.id, select money      respondto do format       format.json          render json              trade trade,             user user,             messages                  messages [traderesponse.tos]                                  end   end codepre  pTrade Model Methodp  precodedef buyworkerassetuser, workerassettypeid, quantity     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do        if workerassettypeid.nil         raise ArgumentError.newYou did not specify the type of worker asset.       end        if quantity.nil         raise ArgumentError.newYou did not specify the amount of worker assets you want to buy.       end        if quantity lt 0         raise ArgumentError.newPlease enter a quantity above 0.       end        quantity  quantity.toi       workerassettype  WorkerAssetType.whereid workerassettypeid.first        if workerassettype.nil         raise ArgumentError.newThere is no worker asset of that type.       end        tradecost  workerassettype.mincost  quantity        if user.money lt tradecost         raise ArgumentError.newYou dont have enough money to make that purchase.       end         Get the users first geo asset, this will eventually have to be dynamic       potentialtotal  WorkerAsset.whereuserid user.id.length  quantity         Catch all for most people       if potentialtotal gt 100         raise ArgumentError.newYou cannot have more than 100 dealers at the current time.       end        quantity.times do         newworkerasset  WorkerAsset.new         newworkerasset.workerassettypeid  workerassettypeid         newworkerasset.geoassetid  user.geoassets.first.id         newworkerasset.userid  user.id         newworkerasset.clockedin  DateTime.now          newworkerasset.save       end        self.buyerid  user.id       self.money  tradecost       self.workerassettypeid  workerassettypeid       self.tradetypeid  TradeType.wherename market.first.id       self.quantity  quantity         save trade       self.save         is this safe       user.money  user.money  tradecost        user.save     end   end codepre

And as of now...Im the only person taking this course, so friends dont know anything about this stuff etc etc. So...okay this program is in the making...but Im only worried about step one so far, which is listing each student and 4 of their marks next to their name.p  pEx.p  precodeJohn Smith 67 87 56 97  Jane Doe 87 56 76 92 codepre  petc etc etc.p  pSo that is the goal.

Negative 34777 pI am making a game that heavily uses sounds. I am creating it using Xna. I currently have a synthesizer with a synth.noteOnsynthNote and synth.noteOffsynthNote methods. The oscillator I am currently using is just a normal Sine wave, although I also have triangle, square, pulse, noise, and sawtooth. However, the tone that the Sine wave makes is not quite what I imagined it in my concept. I want to use a piano sound. Is there any way to make a piano sound dynamically in C I looked this up, and found a hrefhttpcsharpsynthproject.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpcsharpsynthproject.codeplex.coma, but I cant seem to get this working, and I dont even know if there is a realistic piano MIDI.p  pAlthough I am pretty sure this doesnt exist, Ill ask it anyway. Is there a formula, or perhaps algorithm I can use to simulate a piano sound If not, how can I do it I know my electric keyboard can simulate a piano, and it says something about samplings which I have no idea what in the world those are, but they might be relevantp

Negative 34777 pI need to implement a pop up menu with a number of buttons on it. I have created the pop up and dynamically added the buttons to it. Now I need to rearrange the buttons like the iPhone home screen does. When long press gesture occurs the buttons needs to start animating with close buttonlike that which appears when we try to delete an app from the phone. Further I need to rearrange the position of the button by dragging it. I have added animation to the buttons appearance and also close button but Im struggling to find a way to rearrange the button position. I have searched a lot and found many links regarding this functionality but then most of them are pretty lengthy and complex. I just want a quicksimple one which can be implemented fast.

Negative 34777 pI am writing a script that automates the completion a web form in my Rails app using the form entries given on the client side. However, this site uses Javascript, and so Mechanize is out of the question.p  pHowever, everything Ive read about Mechanizes alternatives  Watir Webdriver, Selenium, Capybara Webkit  all focus seemingly exclusively on testing. However, my Rails web app would take in form entries from users, and then enter them using one of these tools into another website. For example, I would need to upload an image ie codeimagecode and enter in different text ie codecitycode into form fields as part of this app, which would take the entries and enter them into the website. p  pSo my first question Can I use any Mechanize alternatives for something besides testing And second Can anyone refer to code examples on the web for nontesting usages of any of the above automatorsp

Negative 34777 pI have a question related to Pivot Tables in Excel. As in the subject, what I am trying to achieve is to filter a pivot table based on yet another pivot table and its output.p  pThe idea is that one pivot table compiles a list of items and sorts them by top 10 based on count.p  pAt this stage, I would like to have another pivot table, which drills down more in detail into a given item and its properties and values, refresh automatically or at least upon hitting altf5 so that each week or month, when the top 10 list changes, the second pivot table checks the top item and generates the detailed report based on that...p  pIn reality this means that I would like to filter the second pivot table based on the top 10 list from the first pivot table.. if that makes sense and is clear enoughp  pIs there a way to do thisp  pThanks Mikep
Negative 34777 pI have a little Access application with linked tables to SQL Server that I use at a couple different sites so the SQL server names and sometimes the SQL database and odbc connection names are different from site to site.  However they use the Access Runtime to use it so dont have the ability to relink tables without the full version.  Im struggling to find a way to catch any ODBC connection errors and then offering them the option to relink the tables by typing in the ODBC connection name etc. and then relinking through VBA code which I believe is possible. a hrefhttpwww.accessprogrammers.co.ukforumsshowthread.phpt143180 relnofollowhttpwww.accessprogrammers.co.ukforumsshowthread.phpt143180a for examplep  pThe database loads immediately on a form with a record source on a linked table so it needs to catch the error on that form if possible.  I guess I can add a main menu with a button to relink tables there but would prefer avoiding introducing a menu form which requires an extra click for users.p  pHave found these articles but Im unable to catch the initial odbc failure to connect in the forms On Error event and have tried the Activate event as well.

Negative 34777 pOk heres the problem if you had some trouble understanding the title. Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comInferisViewDeck relnofollowthisa library here and it is represented by the codeIIViewDeckControllercode.p  pI init it with simple left and center codeUIViewControllerscode p  precodeFTPhoneHomeViewController home  [[FTPhoneHomeViewController alloc] init] FTPhoneSideViewController side  [[FTPhoneSideViewController alloc] init]  IIViewDeckController vdc  [[IIViewDeckController alloc] initWithCenterViewControllerhome leftViewControllerside] [self.delegate changeRootViewControllervdc] codepre  pcodeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode and codeFTPhoneSideViewControllercode are just subclasses of codeUIViewControllercode. The last line removes the current coderootViewControllercode from the window and adds the codeIIViewDeckControllercode.p  pNow in the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode I add another codeUIViewControllercode with the codeaddChildViewControllercode method p  precodeFTTileViewController tileViewController  [[FTTileViewController alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake5.0, 50.0, 469.0, 310 tileData[FTTileFaker prepareTileData] defaultTileConfig[FTTileFaker prepareTileConfigs][0] andTileConfigs[FTTileFaker prepareTileConfigs]] tileViewController.tileSpacing  9.0 [self addChildViewControllertileViewController] [self.view addSubviewtileViewController.view] [tileViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself] codepre  pI did this because this codeFTTileViewControllercode manages a bunch of tiles and from an architectural point of view, this logic is best contained in its own seperate codeUIViewControllercode.p  pWhen I use the codeIIViewDeckControllercode as a coderootViewControllercode from the window, my codeviewWillAppearcode event in the codeFTTileViewControllercode is not called. But it is called in the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode Now when I dont use the codeIIViewDeckControllercode and just add the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode as the coderootViewControllercode of the window, my codeFTTileViewControllercode does get the codeviewWillAppearcode event...p  pMaybe its a bug with the codeIIViewDeckControllercode and I should also post it there. But I dont see what Im doing wrong here. Anyone has any thoughts about thisp  pAnd if anyone could check my general assumption around codeUIViewControllerscode  p  pAdding codechildViewControllerscode to another codeUIViewControllercode is not a requirement to get view cycle methods like codeviewWillAppearcode to be passed onto another codeUIViewControllerscode view. These events are passed when you add another codeUIViewControllerscode view with the codeaddSubviewcode method. But you use the codeaddChildViewControllercode methods for example, to get rotation events and to maintain the codeviewControllerscode hierarchy through your application.p

If I use UIScrollView in the storyboard, all the sprites added in my scene dont become children and will not zoom or pan.p  pIs it possible and can you point me in the right directionp  pEDITstrongememememememememememememstrongp  pIm a little confused by your answer, but heres what I didp  pstrongIn my root view controller .mstrongp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     SKView  showDesigner  SKView self.view     SKScene  scene  [iMarchMyScene sceneWithSizeshowDesigner.bounds.size]     scene.scaleMode  SKSceneScaleModeAspectFill     [showDesigner presentScenescene]  codepre  pstrongIn my scene .mstrong your steps are commentedp  precodeidinitWithSizeCGSizesize      if self  [super initWithSizesize]           create SKView step 1         SKView skviewfield  [[SKView alloc]initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 0, size.width, size.height]          create UIScrollView with same dimensions as your SpriteKit view step 2         UIScrollView uiscrollviewfield  [[UIScrollView alloc]initWithFrameskviewfield.frame]          initialize the field field is the games background node         SKSpriteNode field  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamedField]         field.position  CGPointMakeCGRectGetMidXself.frame, CGRectGetMidYself.frame         field.size  CGSizeMakeself.size.width, self.size.height  3          create a UIView called scrollViewContent with dimensions of background node step 3         UIView scrollViewContent  [[UIView alloc]initWithFramefield.frame]          set UIScrollView contentSize with same dimensions as your scrollViewContent and add a scrollContentview as your UISCrollView subview step 4         [uiscrollviewfield setContentSizeCGSizeMakescrollViewContent.frame.size.width, scrollViewContent.frame.size.height]         scrollViewContent.frame  field.frame         [uiscrollviewfield addSubviewscrollViewContent]            [self addChildfield]  my original code         .....does a bunch of other inits          return self  codepre  pAnd heres where I get lost Step 5 Now, to your root view add your SKView, and UIScrollView on top of SKView.p  pIf I understood you correctly, I need to go to myRootViewController.m and in the viewDidLoad method, add the SKView and UIScrollView which are initialized in myScene.m as subviews to SKView initialized here in the viewDidLoad method I dont see how to do that part.p

Negative 34777 pIm totally stumped by this one. The ideas that Ive found through google stack overflow dont work for me and Ive no idea why.p  pWe recently upgraded the project to Visual Studio 2012 and MVC 4 with .NET 4.5 and now it wont publish properly.p  pWe have another branch that just has the project publishing in Visual Studio 2012 without the upgrade to MVC4 or .NET4.5 and that seems to work, so Im guessing it isnt a Visual Studio issue. Just something with the way that MVC 4 is set up in our project. MVC 3 was added by referencing the DLLs directly from a lib folder we had created in the source control but outside of any projects. MVC 4 is added via NuGet.p  pThe issue is that System.Web.Helpers amongst others dont appear in the bin directory of the published application. This means that when it is put on the test server it wont run as the DLL is missing.p  ul liIve set Copy Local to be TRUE actually, it already was, but I turned if off and on again. I also read somewhere that if the file exists in the GAC it wont matter what this setting is, it wont copy. However, Ive checked and it isnt in the GAC.li liIve ensured that the reference in the MVC application was pointing to the version of the file in the NuGet packages folder.

Negative 34777 pI have a process that is blocked on a socket. When input becomes available in the socket the process decodes the input and most of the time does nothing but update an in memory structure. Periodically the input is such that more complex analysis is triggered, ultimately resulting in a outgoing message on another connection. I would like to minimize the latency in this later case, i.e. minimize the time between receiving and sending. What I have noticed is that latency numbers are 2x  worse when the time between interesting events increases. What could this be attributed to and how could I improve on it I have tried to reserve a CPU for my process but I havent see much of an improvement.p

Negative 34777 pI created a simple class with one field.  codeclass Testint valuecodep  pIf I use the preserve references feature and set it to all i.e. both objects and arrays, then when I simply serialize an array of Test objects, it gets serialized as a JSON object with a special values member with the array values, along with the expected id property to preserve the array reference.  That much is fine, but once again the whole thing breaks on deserialization.p  pStepping through the source code, I discovered that simply because the test for IsReadOnlyOrFixedSize is true, it sets a flag createdFromNonDefaultConstructor to true, which doesnt even make any sense, because although it is a fixed size array, it is created from a default constructor, unless it considers any fixed size array constructor a nondefault constructor.  The bottom line is that it should be able to handle something so basic, and yet it throws this error  Cannot preserve reference to array or readonly list, or list created from a nondefault constructor.p  pHow can I deserialize a basic array while preserving all references in JSON.NET without getting an errorp

Negative 34777 pWe are new to Gradle and dependency resolution. I am in the process of creating pom.xml files for all our internallygenerated artifacts and want to set up a job in our Jenkins server to verify the dependencies are properly defined and not conflicting i.e. LibA requires x1.0.jar, LibB requires x1.1.jar, and AppY requires both LibA and LibB.p  pAs such, Ive set up a dummy project in SVN that simply includes a bunch of our internal artifacts as dependencies. Following TTD, I intentionally included some errors in the declarations i.e. group and name, but not version. Sure enough, those dependencies cant be found.p  pBut when I run this build with gradle i.e. gradle dependencies it includes all the failure messages but still says the build succeeded Not goodp  pHow can I, using GradleJenkins, set up an automated job that will verify all dependencies are foundp

Negative 34777 pI was experimenting with the new Lambdas in Java 8, and I am looking for a way to use reflection on the lambda classes to get the return type of a lambda function. I am especially interested in cases where the lambda implements a generic superinterface. In the code example below, codeMapFunctionltF, Tgtcode is the generic superinterface, and I am looking for a way to find out what type binds to the generic parameter codeTcode.p  pWhile Java throws away a lot of generic type information after the compiler, subclasses and anonymous subclasses of generic superclasses and generic superinterfaces did preserve that type information. Via reflection, these types were accessible. In the example below emcase 1em, reflection tells my that the codeMyMappercode implementation of codeMapFunctioncode binds codejava.lang.Integercode to the generic type parameter codeTcode.p  pEven for subclasses that are themselves generic, there are certain means to find out what binds to a generic parameter, if some others are known. Consider emcase 2em in the example below, the codeIdentityMappercode where both codeFcode and codeTcode bind to the same type. When we know that, we know the type codeFcode if we know the parameter type codeTcode which in my case we do.p  pThe question is now, how can I realize something similar for the Java 8 lambdas Since they are actually not regular subclasses of the generic superinterface, the above described method does not work. Specifically, can I figure out that the codeparseLambdacode binds codejava.lang.Integercode to codeTcode, and the codeidentityLambdacode binds the same to codeFcode and codeTcodep  pPS In theory it should possible to decompile the lambda code and then use an embedded compiler like the JDT and tap into its type inference. I hope that there is a simpler way to do this p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode   The superinterface.   public interface MapFunctionltF, Tgt       T mapF value      Case 1 A nongeneric subclass.   public class MyMapper implements MapFunctionltString, Integergt       public Integer mapString value          return Integer.valueOfvalue           A generic subclass   public class IdentityMapperltEgt implements MapFunctionltE, Egt       public E mapE value          return value            Instantiation through lambda    public MapFunctionltString, Integergt parseLambda  String str gt  return Integer.valueOfstr   public MapFunctionltE, Egt identityLambda  value gt  return value    public static void mainString[] args       case 1     getReturnTypeMyMapper.class     gt returns java.lang.Integer       case 2     getReturnTypeRelativeToParameterIdentityMapper.class, String.class     gt returns java.lang.String   private static Classltgt getReturnTypeClassltgt implementingClass      Type superType  implementingClass.getGenericInterfaces[0]      if superType instanceof ParameterizedType          ParameterizedType parameterizedType  ParameterizedType superType         return Classltgt parameterizedType.getActualTypeArguments[1]          else return null   private static Classltgt getReturnTypeRelativeToParameterClassltgt implementingClass, Classltgt parameterType      Type superType  implementingClass.getGenericInterfaces[0]      if superType instanceof ParameterizedType          ParameterizedType parameterizedType  ParameterizedType superType         TypeVariableltgt inputType  TypeVariableltgt parameterizedType.getActualTypeArguments[0]         TypeVariableltgt returnType  TypeVariableltgt parameterizedType.getActualTypeArguments[1]          if inputType.getName.equalsreturnType.getName              return parameterType                  else               some logic that figures out composed return types                    return null  codepre

Negative 34777 pIm trying to construct a table using ngTable, but with different custom filtering than described in a hrefhttpbazaltcms.comngtableexample11the example from the ngTable pagea.p  pI want filtering in place, but I dont want ngTable to render the filter selectors.  I want to render them myself above the table, and then reference them in my getData method.p  pThe example referred to earlier doesnt explain how any of that machinery works.  I have no idea exactly what needs to be specified in the filter property in each td element.  I understand the basic syntax of the AngularJS filter function, but Im not clear on what ngTable is doing with this.  From the one example, it looks like I can only do equals checking, which would only select rows where the associated column value is equal to the filter value.  That isnt quite what I need.p  pMy table has several columns.  Two of them are called key and failed, being string and boolean respectively.  When Im rendering these filter fields above the table, I need a custom label for the failed filter.  Filtering for the key column should match the filter value with any substring of the key values.  For instance, if I have key values of abc, abac, and def, a filter value of a will result in the first two entries showing, and not showing the def entry.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pRelated to this, I wish I could figure out how to do something like thisp  pLets say I have a ngRepeat expression in my table element like this, using standard angularjs filtersp  precodeitem in data  customfilterparam  anothercustomfilterparam codepre  pWe know that this doesnt quite work, as those filters will only apply to one page slice obtained from the getData method.  What Id really like to be able to do in my getData method is simply access the entire filter chain, including the parameter expressions, and simply pass a different array into it, being the entire original data list, not just the page slice.p  pAt the same time, Id need to be able to turn off the filtering angularjs is doing by itself, by executing that filter chain in its normal processing.p  pThis sounds difficult, but I find the current API requires a lot of coupling between the html and the javascript.  It would be nice if the html could specify the desired filtering, and the javascript would just use that entire filter chain, but use it on the entire data list, not just the page slice.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHeres a relevant excerpt from my HTMLp  precodeltlabel forkeysFiltergtFilter Keysltlabelgt ltinput idkeysFilter typetext ngmodelkeysFiltergt ltlabel forshowOnlyFailedgtShow only queries that failedltlabelgt ltinput idshowOnlyFailed typecheckbox ngmodelshowOnlyFailedgt lttable ngtabletableParams tablepaginationcustompages classtablegt lttr ngrepeatqueryInfo in datagt lt   filterFailedshowOnlyFailed  filterMatchingKeyskeysFilter gt codepre  pHeres my tableParams codep  precodescope.tableParams   new ngTableParams     page 1,     count 10,     sorting          lastRun desc      ,      debugMode true,     total  scope.completedQueries.length,     getData    functiondefer, params          var orderedData  params.sorting                  filterorderByscope.completedQueries, params.orderBy                  data         orderedData  filterfilterFailedorderedData, scope.showOnlyFailed         orderedData  filterfilterMatchingKeysorderedData, scope.keysFilter          params.totalorderedData.length         defer.resolveorderedData.sliceparams.page  1  params.count,                                                      params.page  params.count       codepre  pNote that I used have this ngTable not using the data list, and just iterating through my completedQueries list.

Negative 34777 pIve read the documentation, and it confuses me every time, just because it doesnt answer some basic things.  I realize the main purpose of the class method coderespondtocode which is normally used at the top of the controller is for use in conjunction with coderespondwithcode.  And the purpose of the instance method coderespondtocode normally at the end of each action is to provide different responses for different formats.p  pI also know that its possible to consolidate the instance method version to look like the class method, but used inside an action, for conciseness, like this coderespondtohtmlcode.  The use case for this is another purpose of coderespondtocode, which is to refuse requests for unspecified formats. I think it raises an UnspecifiedFormat exceptionp  pDoes the class method also have the same functionality  For instance, if I have a controller that emonlyem responds to html, if I just put coderespondtohtmlcode at the top of the file, can I expect it to refuse requests for other formats  Ive had problems with it doing that, so I dont know if Ive been doing something wrong, or if its just not supposed to work the same as the instance method in that respect.p

Negative 34777 pHas anybody successfully implemented the Google IMA HTML5 SDK in IOS They say that you should make the call to request ads based on a user interaction.

I dont want that.p  pAlso, I would like the actual video clip to play automatically after the ad has finished playing.

Negative 34777 pSoon after learning that recompiling with DOPENSSLNOHEARTBEATS will disable TLSv1 Heartbeats in OpenSSL 1.0.1e, I wondered why it was not a runtime option instead, maybe called something like SSLOPNOTLSHEARTBEATS.p  pTherefore I looked into SSL.H and discovered that options is an unsigned long bitmask, which would be 32 or 64 bits depending on the compiling platformmode, but it seemed that the OpenSSL code assumes is 32 bits, and more importantly it means it only has 32 possible options, which seems to have been exhausted already, all except the bit 0x00000400L, I copied them from SSL.Hp  precode Option bits for SSLCTXsetoptions   define SSLOPMICROSOFTSESSIDBUG                    0x00000001L define SSLOPNETSCAPECHALLENGEBUG                   0x00000002L define SSLOPLEGACYSERVERCONNECT                    0x00000004L define SSLOPNETSCAPEREUSECIPHERCHANGEBUG         0x00000008L  define SSLOPSSLREF2REUSECERTTYPEBUG              0x00000010L define SSLOPMICROSOFTBIGSSLV3BUFFER               0x00000020L define SSLOPMSIESSLV2RSAPADDING                   0x00000040L define SSLOPSSLEAY080CLIENTDHBUG                 0x00000080L  define SSLOPTLSD5BUG                               0x00000100L define SSLOPTLSBLOCKPADDINGBUG                    0x00000200L      0x00000400L SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY OPTION BIT FREE   define SSLOPDONTINSERTEMPTYFRAGMENTS              0x00000800L  define SSLOPNOQUERYMTU                             0x00001000L define SSLOPCOOKIEEXCHANGE                          0x00002000L define SSLOPNOTICKET                                0x00004000L define SSLOPCISCOANYCONNECT                         0x00008000L  define SSLOPNOSESSIONRESUMPTIONONRENEGOTIATION   0x00010000L define SSLOPNOCOMPRESSION                           0x00020000L define SSLOPALLOWUNSAFELEGACYRENEGOTIATION        0x00040000L define SSLOPSINGLEECDHUSE                          0x00080000L  define SSLOPSINGLEDHUSE                            0x00100000L define SSLOPEPHEMERALRSA                            0x00200000L define SSLOPCIPHERSERVERPREFERENCE                 0x00400000L define SSLOPTLSROLLBACKBUG                         0x00800000L  define SSLOPNOSSLv2                                 0x01000000L define SSLOPNOSSLv3                                 0x02000000L define SSLOPNOTLSv1                                 0x04000000L define SSLOPNOTLSv12                               0x08000000L  define SSLOPNOTLSv11                               0x10000000L define SSLOPNETSCAPECADNBUG                       0x20000000L define SSLOPNETSCAPEDEMOCIPHERCHANGEBUG          0x40000000L  define SSLOPCRYPTOPROTLSEXTBUG                     0x80000000L codepre  pDo you think is this the reason why they decided to do DOPENSSLNOHEARTBEATS instead SSLOPNOTLSHEARTBEATS   If so, why didnt they use 0x00000400L for SSLOPNOTLSHEARTBEATS  I would like to know your opinion on this.

Here is my code so far, I believe I am on the right track but I am having trouble because I need the program to do a openfiledialog so I can manually choose the client.txt file and then import the data. Right now I am getting an error System.IO.StreamReader does not contain a constructor that takes 0 arguments  p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.ComponentModel using System.Data using System.Drawing using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Windows.Forms using System.IO  namespace Chapter17Ex.Sample2      public partial class Form1  Form              OpenFileDialog filechooser  new OpenFileDialog         public Form1                      InitializeComponent                   private void btnImportClickobject sender, EventArgs e                      StreamReader fileReader  new StreamReader              string inputrecord  fileReader.ReadLine             string filename             string[] inputfields              if inputrecord  null                              inputfields  inputrecord.Split,                 txtAccount.Text  inputfields[0]                 txtFirstName.Text  inputfields[1]                 txtLastName.Text  inputfields[2]                 txtBalance.Text  inputfields[3]                           else                              MessageBox.ShowEnd of File                                   private void btnExitClickobject sender, EventArgs e                      Application.Exit                codepre
Negative 34777 pI am doing scala through the functional programming course on coursera. I noticed that the automatic style checker tells me that the use of return is a bad habit. Why is that To me it seems like the use of return would make the code more readable because any other programmers can instantly see that and what the function is returning. p  pExample, why is this p  precodedef sumxs List[Int] Int       if xs.length  0       return 0     else       return xs.head  sumxs.tail       codepre  pConsidered to be worse than this p  precodedef sumxs List[Int] Int       if xs.length  0       0     else       xs.head  sumxs.tail       codepre  pI am used to javascript, so that might be a reason why I feel uneasy about it. Still, can anybody make it obvious why the addition of the return statement makes my code worse If so, why is there a return statement in the language p

Negative 34777 pFirst let me say I think this site is a Godsend, and I am extremely grateful for all Ive learned. I have an MVC3 component Im working with. I want to populate a selectlist and when the user selects one of the options, I want a to load a partial view with the data displayed. Everything works so far except Im missing the piece that refreshes the partial view. When the page originally loads, I see the empty  container in the code. I get no JS errors and Firebug shows the properly formatted HTML returned. So what part of the operation am I missing to refresh the partial view on the page Please advise and thanx in advance.p  pThe Viewp  precode    lttrgt   ltthgtSelect a User to view their Rolesltthgt   lttdgtlt  Html.DropDownListUserListForRoleView, list, Please choose a Usergtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgt    lttdgt       lt Html.RenderPartialViewUsersInRolegt     lttdgt  lttrgt codepre  pp  precodedocument.readyfunction     UserListForRoleView.changefunction        var selectedID  this.val      .getUserAdminRepositoryViewUsersInRoleuser  selectedID         codepre  pTHe Controllerp  precode   public ActionResult ViewUsersInRole              string user  Request[user]         string[] selectedRoles  Roles.GetRolesForUseruser         Listltstringgt data  new Listltstringgt          if selectedRoles.Length gt 0                      data  selectedRoles.ToListltstringgt                  else                      data.AddNo data found                   ViewData[UsersinRole]  data          return PartialViewViewUsersInRole      codepre  pThe PartialView in its entiretyp  precodelt Page LanguageC InheritsSystem.Web.Mvc.ViewPageltdynamicgt gt   ltulgt lt        Listltstringgt list  ViewData[UsersinRole] as Listltstringgt    if list  null ampamp list.Count gt 0             foreach string item in list        gt         ltligtlt item gtltligt      lt      gt ltulgt  codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG3yzC.png altenter image description herep

It looks the tutorial is a bit outdated and relies on the DPAD to navigate up and down the list of tasks in order to target a list item and delete it using the Delete Button in the applications menu. I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to select a list item on click and delete it using the delete button. Right now when a click a list item it does nothing, so the application doesnt know which is selected, when I click the delete button. Here is my XML and Java code.

Negative 34777 pThis is my second asp.net application. In the first application I relied on query to pass values between pages.

I tried to use the OnClick event to set the value of a public property prior to the page redirect. This did not work because PreviousPage.property threw a null pointer exception.

Negative 34777 pI have a codeGridViewcode and when a button is pressed I want all of the elements to fade out one at a time or fade in, if they are already invisible. On the fade in end, I havep  precodeAnimation fadeIn  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationactivity, R.anim.fadein LayoutAnimationController layoutAnimationController  new LayoutAnimationControllerfadeIn gridView.setLayoutAnimationlayoutAnimationController gridView.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE codepre  pWorks as intended. Each view in the GridView fade in one at a time and then the entire GridView is visible. On the fade out end, I though something similar might workp  precodeAnimation fadeOut  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationactivity, R.anim.fadeout LayoutAnimationController layoutAnimationController  new LayoutAnimationControllerfadeOut gridView.setLayoutAnimationlayoutAnimationController gridView.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE codepre  pHowever, this just makes the GridView instantly disappear, no animation takes place, it just becomes invisible. Why is this I think I saw a method of extending the codeLayoutAnimationControllercode wherein I can specify what the visibility is after animation but is there an easier way to get the fade out I wantp  pEDIT So basically, as each view gets animated with a particular animation, I want it to change status to either VISIBLE or INVISIBLE, I suppose if the entire contents of the GridView are INVISIBLE I dont really care about the GridView itself being invisible. For some reason, this is the exact behavior I get on the fadeIn but on the fadeOut things dont work as nicely, Im guessing the fadeIn working is just a silly coincidence and there is actually a nicer way of doing this.p  pI realize one way is to manually write all the animations for every View visible on the screen but if this can be achieved via the LayoutAnimationController, thats obviously much better.p  pEDIT The jist of my problem onButtonPressed, I want the Views present in a GridView to fade out one at a time and the entire GridView to be invisible at the end of the animation.p

Negative 34777 pIn a recent fun project a system for managing bills and clients I decided to use PDO as database interface. I came along the problem, that I was constantly writing the same code when using prepared statements prepare, set parameters, execute etc. so I decided to write a little helper class which contains methods which are faster to use select, selectRow, etc..p  pI know that this is not optimal, and that PDO itself is already good enough I have read through some other questions regarding PDO helper classes, but my question refers more to the general design when using static helper classesp  pHeres some code of my first approachp  precodeclass DBA    private con    public function construct        thisgtcon  new PDO  ..        public function select query, params  array       sth  thisgtcongtpreparequery      ....        returns an object   public function fetchObject query, params  array, class      sth  this gt con gt preparequery     sth gt setFetchModePDOFETCHCLASS, class     ..     ...   class Bill      public date     public payed      ...      public function markAsPayed         dba  new DBA       ifdba gt exec UPDATE .., args           return true,              return false         index.php dba  new DBA  bill  dba gt fetchObject SELECT .., args, Bill bill gt markAsPayed codepre  pI discovered the following problem I was using the class in other classes by creating an instance of it for example in objects I fetched from rows from my database. So there would be tons of instances which means tons of connections of the helper class, because I was creating an instance in every method in other classes, that used the helper class. When I was calling methods, that used the helper class, on objects which were created by the helper class, the whole application got super slow.p  pWould it be a good solution to make the helper class static And if so, how do I connect to the database Should I use singleton pattern I dont want to reconnect to the database in every method of the helper class, but have a global connection in the helper class.p

Negative 34777 pImagine this You have a number of controls which you want to have a context menu, the same menu. That context menu will be dynamic and can change at any time. So you create a static class like thisp  precodepublic static class EmployeeContextMenu      private static ContextMenu EmployeeMenu  get set       static EmployeeContextMenu              EmployeeMenu  new ContextMenu           public static ContextMenu Get              return EmployeeMenu           public static void SetListltStringgt employees              EmployeeMenu  new ContextMenu         MenuItem mi         foreach var item in employees                      mi  new MenuItem             mi.Header  item             EmployeeMenu.Items.Addmi                codepre  pAnd at some point you need to change the menu items and use the Set method above, works perfectly fine. Somehow you want to bind your controls context menu to the Get method. Might be achieved likep  precodeltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltObjectDataProvider ObjectTypexType localEmployeeContextMenu MethodNameGet xKeymyCM gt ltWindow.Resourcesgt ltGridgt     ltTextBlock Nametb ContextMenuBinding SourceStaticResource myCM gt ltGridgt codepre  pAnd of course you want the controls context menu to be updated as soon as the static Set method is called.p  pBut above, something is basically wrong with the binding...no context menu shows up at all. So how would you set the binding Datacontext, datasource Where and howp  pIt would of course work if you implementp  precodetb.ContextMenu  EmployeeContextMenu.Get codepre  pBut that would be a bad solution if you have an unknown number of dynamically created user controls which you badly want to have the mentioned context menu which will be updated on the fly.p

Negative 34777 pIm completely new to using Node.js and even utilizing the command line, so this question may be extremely elementary, but I am unable to find a solution.p  pI am trying to set up an app directory using Node.js and NPM. For some reason, whenever I try to use the port5000 I get a Cannot GET error. My question is, why is my setup for my app directory not workingp  pI have installed connect and servestatic, and yet it will not retrieve files and listen on port 5000.

I do this as a user kstach1. p  pThe only thing I can think of that I may be doing wrong, is where my files are located. I have the angularjs folder located in the root user folder on my Mac kstach1, as well as the server.js file. Is this incorrect If this is not the issue, is it because of where Node is installed usrlocalbinnode My research to this point has led me to think that my problem could also be that I need to add the installation directory to my path. However, I dont want to mess with this unless I know that is the case.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 34777 pThis is kind of a nitpicky issue but its driving me crazy. Ive built a boostrap responsive web template that uses Font Awesome icons throughout. p  pWhen I go to load or reload a page what seems to happen is that a split second before the font awesome icons load the grid loads and then is populated by the icons. Now because the template is responsive it shuttersjiggles when it loads from a grid without the icons in it to the correct size when the icons come in and take up their respective places.p  pDoes anyone have a suggestion on how to either change the order of what loads first or to hold back the entire page until everything has loaded and then display in one gop  pIve attempted to rearrange what order the CSS files load in tried swapping bootstrap with fontawesome CSS linksp  pIm wondering if there is a JavaScript event that will wait until everything loads before displaying.

Negative 34777 pI have a bit of an interesting problem I am trying to currently figure out using angular.p  pI have 1 json object I need to use split between 2 controllers, I want to be able to change save new items and delete json the json in each controller separately. So when I modify something in one controller it just saves that part of the json  not the whole thing.p  pI will explain this as clearly as I can p  pI have a factory that sends the json to both controllers, heres what it looks likefake json data for now p  precode.factoryUserService, functionhttp   var LevelsHere  http.getassetsimagesgenerated.json           .successfunctiondata             return data            return      all function        return LevelsHere           codepre  pEach controller then lists it as a dependancy then calls it like so  p  precodeUserService.all.thenfunctiondata             scope.listTable  data.data              codepre  pThis works great, and the 2way data binding  is awesome in this case because if i change something in 1 controller, it changes immediately in the other. My real problem with this is I want to be able to save the content changed in the json in each controller individually. p  pSo, the Json has a parent name and 2 children. Each controller has access to the parent and 1 of the children so for example. controller 1 has parent and child 1, and controller 2 has parent and child 2. When I want to click my save function  for example in controller 1 I want to save the json to the backend to overwrite the old stuff strongbut onlystrong from the controller I am choosing to save. So Even if i made changes in controller 2, when I save 1, i Just want it to send parentits index and child 1 to overwrite.p  pI think the problem may root from the fact that I am fully binding the data in each controller to all the the json maybe Currently I am just trying to send the scope.listTable back, and its registering all the changes between both sections.p  pApologies if I rambled on here  I am trying to be as clear as possible. Thanks for taking the time to readp  pstrongEDITstrong I was thinking  and I dont know if this is possible so bear with me  Can it be designated that the json i bring into listTable only binds to what it needs. So for example  controller 1 only binded to all the parent and child 1 and not child 2. Is this possiblep  pstrongEDIT 2strong Following up on the previous edit  I think I boiled down the question to  can I only save certain parts of the json instead of the whole object. I cannot have it save both child 1 and 2 at the same time because it might overwrite things that are not meant to be saved at that time. so its either  can I just use the selected pieces of json, or can I just save the selected pieces of json. thanks again for readingp

Negative 34777 pSo givenp  precodevar person  name , address , phonenumber  codepre  pI want to create a loop to receive user input until they decide they dont want to input anymore information and input nothing or click cancel. Id also like to use the person object as a prototype.p  pSo I guess an object just to store the nameaddressphone number of an arbitrary number of people. My logic for this would be to dynamically add an entire array to an object for every iteration of my loop. My code looks something like thisp  precodevar person  name , address , phonenumber  var customer  [] used to store each person   var input  x  loop prompting user to input nameaddressphone number forvar i  0 input   i   var input  promptInput separated by commas    example input mike, main, 123456789    var results  input.split,  create an array from the input    move input into the person array.    person to look like name  mike, address  main, phone  123456789   person.name  results.shift   person.address  results.shift   person.phone  results     customer[i]  personstore the person array into the customer array.    codepre  pIve been trying to dynamically generate something like thisp  precodecustomer   [name, address, phone,  name, address, phone,  name, address, phone] codepre  pand then be able to access it and print it. ive been trying to access it withp  precodeconsole.logcustomer[0].phone codepre  punfortunately im getting an error.p  psorry for my error, console.log prints nothing so it seems like theres nothing stored in customer[0].phone.p  pi cant get access to any of the data that ive prompted the user for and saved in variables. when i use the alert function all i get is a blank box. whenever i try to print customer i get the message [object Object]or something along those linesp

Negative 34777 pIm currently trying to write a script that backs up several of my sites along with their databases.p  pAll is working well but Im trying to be a little cleverer with my log  basically, at the moment it will attempt to run mysqldump and will echo success or failure.p  pWhat Id rather do is output the actual error rather than just an unhelpful mysqldump failed message. Ive had a look around and Im almost able to do this how I want using 2 logfile.txtp  pMy original commandp  precodemysqldump u asdsa passwordDBPASS DBNAME gt MYSQLLOCATION  if [  eq 0 ] then     echo e mysqldump successfully finished at date dmY HMSr gtgt LOGLOCATION else     echo e mysqldump failed at date dmY HMSr gtgt LOGLOCATION fi codepre  pSo I added 2 LOGLOCATION  to catch the actual error. So my updated command looks like this this addition is in the first linep  precodemysqldump u DBUSERpasswordDBPASS DBNAME 2gt LOGLOCATION  gt MYSQLLOCATION  if [  eq 0 ] then     echo e mysqldump successfully finished at date dmY HMSr gtgt LOGLOCATION else     echo e mysqldump failed at date dmY HMSr gtgt LOGLOCATION fi codepre  pThis outputs the error to my log file but overwrites anything in there. It also means that my error checking if statement doesnt pick up the error.p  pIs there any way that I canp  pa catch the actual error from the mysqldump function i.e. access denied for this user b append this error to an existing error log c also append a success or fail message after the above error has outputtedp  pAny help would be greatp  pThanksp

Negative 34777 pI have a Hprose server which handles user authentication. I am trying to write a logonService which returns a UserInfo object after user logged in. In the code below, hprose.HttpClient.login is called asynchronously and it takes seconds, but the code in controller keeps going after creating the logonService instance. so that scope.user is always null, and logonService.logon is never called.

Negative 34777 pI am creating console application that does some file conversions. These conversions are easily done creating a model from the input file and then executing razor models for the output.p  pTo have this working in the IDE I used Visual Studio 2015 preview and created a vnext console application that uses MVC. You get razor support out of the box then. To get this all working you need to host the MVC app though, and the cheapest way to do that is hosting is through a WebListener. So I host the MVC app and then call it through codehttplocalhost5003etcetccode to get the rendered views that construct the output.p  pBut the console app is not supposed to listen touse a port. It is just a command line tool for file conversions. If multiple instances would run at the same time they would fight to host the pages on the same port. This could of coarse be prevented by choosing a port dynamically, but this is not what I am looking forp  pSo my question is how would you get this working without using a port, but using as much of the vnext frameworks as possible.p  pIn short how can I use cshtml files that I pass models in a console app that does not use a port using the vnext razor engine.p  pHere is some code I currently usep  pProgram.csp  precodeusing Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting using Microsoft.AspNet.Http using Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc using Microsoft.Framework.ConfigurationModel using Microsoft.Framework.DependencyInjection using Microsoft.Framework.DependencyInjection.Fallback using System using System.IO using System.Net.Http using System.Net.Http.Headers using System.Threading using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Xml.Linq  namespace ConsoleTest      public class Program              private readonly IServiceProvider hostServiceProvider          public ProgramIServiceProvider hostServiceProvider                      hostServiceProvider  hostServiceProvider                   public async Taskltstringgt GetWebpageAsync                      using var httpClient  new HttpClient                              httpClient.BaseAddress  new Urihttplocalhost5003homesvgidx1                 httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear                 httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Addnew MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValuetextxml                 return await httpClient.GetStringAsync                                public Taskltintgt Mainstring[] args                      var config  new Configuration             config.AddCommandLineargs              var serviceCollection  new ServiceCollection             serviceCollection.AddHostingServices.GetDefaultServicesconfig             serviceCollection.AddInstanceltIHostingEnvironmentgtnew HostingEnvironment  WebRoot  wwwroot              var services  serviceCollection.BuildServiceProviderhostServiceProvider              var context  new HostingContext                              Services  services,                 Configuration  config,                 ServerName  Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener,                 ApplicationName  ConsoleTest                           var engine  services.GetServiceltIHostingEnginegt             if engine  null                              throw new ExceptionTODO IHostingEngine service not available exception                           using engine.Startcontext                              var tst  GetWebpageAsync                 tst.Wait                 File.WriteAllTextCresult.svg, tst.Result.TrimStart                  Console.WriteLineStarted the server..

Negative 34777 pThis past week, there was the launch of a new tool called Homescreen that allows people to share a screenshot of the apps that they have on their iPhone home screen. For example a hrefhttpshomescreen.isiamfinnym relnofollowhttpshomescreen.isiamfinnymap  pId like to build a scraper that extracts the names of all the apps given a users page in addition to their location on the screen. How would I do this I know how to build a normal HTML scraper, but it looks like the apps are generated onto the page via some kind of React.js javascript call, and Im not sure how to go about figuring this out. I can write basic Javascript, but have never used React.js before and I dont know how to get started.p

Negative 34777 pI get reports of this exception and I cant target the cause. Id like to know if anyone encountered this issue and if theres a way to fix it. Every report I get is from a Samsung Galaxy device Tab 3, s5, s3 neo, note II to make some names with Android 4.4 . I am not a professional developer and I dont have such devices at my disposal to reproduce the issue I have been testing the app on my Galaxy s3 and I never stumbled upon this exception when it was running on its stock 4.3 firmware, and neither now that it runs on CM11, so I suppose it is bound to be related to Samsungs 4.4 firmware.

Negative 34777 pThanks for attempting to help me with my issue.  I feel there is a simple answer to this, but cant seem to figure it out myself.  I am working on a quiz similar to Buzzfeed, and once the quiz is answered, I click a button that takes me the result page. What I am trying to do is share the quiz result page on facebook ex. My ideal ice cream is vanilla, click here to find yours.  What I want to happen is for that page to be shared on a facebook wall, but when the person clicks the shared link, it takes them to the actual quiz itself.  So I am trying to redirect the clicker to the actual quiz from the shared result page.  I checked out facebooks dev page, and came across this a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocssharingreferencesharedialog relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocssharingreferencesharedialoga, but that seemed a bit over my head.  Can anyone explain it in easier terms For the time being, we can use Yahoo as my quiz page, and ESPN.com as my result page. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. p

When someone buys a large number of widgets, Nick falls in love with them, and gives them an even bigger discount off of the normal price But his problem is this sometimes these amounts are lower than his original costs, so he loses money on the sale For simplicity, we will assume that each widget costs Nick 0.40 each so he should be selling each of them for a higher cost than this to his customers codedefine WIDGETCOST 0.40codep  pTo help Nick save his business, please write a program that will prompt him for the price he will sell each widget for, the percent he will discount medium purchases by, and the percent he will discount large purchases by each as whole numbers of a percent, then will output amessage indicating which of these choices is causing him not to make a profit.

Negative 34777 pI have been using a really nice programme called GlovePIE in order to control the windows mouse and keyboard. It has as part of its API the mouse.swallow which controls whether the cursor is moving with the mouse or not. The problem is that this does not work in PC games, since they use raw mouse input and I think GlovePIE blocks the mouse messages at directinput level. So, my question is, is it possible to have windows code that suppresses the mouse movement when a key on the keyboard is pressed. That should happen before the message gets read by a PC game. I need this for a VR app that should switch between the HMD and airmouse dynamically. p

Negative 34777 pExcel experts p  pI am dealing with a spreadsheet that has multiple macros running through it and has been extremely useful, however it does have one process that I would like to see if it is possible to automate, and so far my attempts and research has come up with nada.p  pI have a userform entering in a clients email address directly into the next row of Sheet1 that is empty, and the email is in column H2H3000.  There are several other tasks that Column H is already programmed to do, for instance, when the email is an active hyperlink and the user selects it, it generates an email message through Outlook and within column K, anytime a hyperlink is selected, it records the date and time of the action, as well as the userID of who made the action.  The main problem with this current setup is that, a user has to go through each cell in column H and doubleclick the email and click outside of it in order to activate the hyperlink.  Is there a way that this can be automated to any enter within Column Hp  pThanksp

Negative 34777 pIm developing an application for an enterprise which has both web and desktop versions. The desktop version, written in C will be used by the employees and the Web version mostly will be used by executives and its written in ASP.NET. p  pThe application will be used by about 120 employees across 2530 cities and it will be generating data at the rate of approximately 2GBs per day. Because of the Web version and the data must be readily available to anyone in the organization at anytime, Ill be buying dedicated servers on the behalf of the organization and will continue to look after them in the future.p  pIll be honest, Ive never dealt with anything like this before. Its a big project Im working on. I wanted to know whats the best way of storing such data Ill briefly explain what Ive thought ofp  pAs per now, Im thinking to buy 2 dedicated servers initially.p  pServer 1 will have a 256gb SSD storage and a 3 TB Enterprise HDD. On the SSD Drive, Im planning to host the Web version and the MSSQL Database of the application on the SSD drive while all the data goes into the hard disk drive. This server will have 32 GBs of RAM along with a quad core Intel Xeon 1270 processor. Considering the current estimated rate of data per working day, the HDD may last upto 2 years or more.p  pServer 2 will be a storage server for backups. Daily backups of the data will be maintained on this server Using custom developed tools. It will have 12 TBs of Enterprise storage along with an i5 Processor and 16 GBs of RAM.p  pThe application is developed to work with multiple servers. So if one is down, it will look for an available server and perform its routine operations. For now, the backup utility is set to clone data on 2 servers and will add more if the need is felt in the future.p  pWhat do you think, is this design okay As Ive never done anything like this before, looking for some professional advice. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 34777 pLet me stress that I am not a programmer but I like messing around with things.  Ive been using ifttt and nest for years and recently started using smartthings to do cool things in my house.  p  pI wanted to power off devices such as my lights and water heater based on leaving my house.  Rather than having this depend on one device such as a phone or keyfoob, I wanted to use the nest autoaway feature.p  pAutoaway doesnt appear to be exposed to ifttt or smartthings.  Ive asked nestsupport and they told me to come here o.  p  pDoes anyone from nest developer team know when developers and other products will be able to consume this from he nest device  Its a real shame that after several years this isnt exposed yet.  Not only that but it could be an additional selling point to integrate and turn onoff items in your house.p  pThankp

Negative 34777 pIm designing a wrapper over various computational functionality. Some of the underlying backends require some init functions to be called before any other API calls are made. I could use some static variable that is initialized before main, and wrap it in some function as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2330158256138herea so that I can catch any errors produced during initialization.p  pI wonder if there is a better way to handle this. Note that there will never be an instance of the class template, as everything is either a typedef or static member.p

Negative 34777 pI am building a Windows Store application in XAMLC for a Windows 8.1 Professional environment.p  pMy project has a requirement that I must support multiple languages in addition to multiple translations for any given language. For example, I may have a label that would be displayed in English or French, but in English it may need to display the word Title or the word Heading depending on the customers preferences.p  pMy issue is that I cannot figure out a way to package and switch between multiple resource dictionaries for the same language while still using the builtin localization functionality provided by XAML for WinRT i.e. using the Uid property on my controls to bind them to a resource dictionary.p  pIve noticed two functions, ResourceManager.LoadPriFiles and ResourceManager.UnloadPriFiles, that I thought might allow me to swap out resource dictionaries at runtime, but I cant figure out how to get the PRI files to be package outside of the applications main resource map to allow the loading and unloading.p  pIve also considered creating a custom data binding or converter that I could use to bind the controls text manually, but that would cost me the ability to see labels at design time in Blend as well as sacrificing the convenience of the builtin localization capabilities.p  pAnother option was to compile a separate instance of the application for each of the custom translations the customer might require, but obviously thats not a very maintainable way of solving the issue...p  pFinally, I had considered repurposing something like the homeregion qualifier of the ResourceContext to solve the issue however, that seems very limiting as there are already preestablished homeregions that I would have to choose from. Repurposing fields seems like a bad idea in general.p

Negative 34777 pI have been trying to scrape some data off a website. The source has differentiated all the headers of tables to that of the actual contents by different class names.

Negative 34777 pI would like the scenes of my game in SpriteKit to appear differently sized depending on the size of the device. Right now I am manually resizing and positioning some of my nodes with an if statement checking for frame size, but unfortunately I cannot do this for all of my sprites due to the mechanics of my game I am detecting collisions based off of the positions of my nodes,  not by using PhysicsBodies. If I were to change the size of the nodes, these collisions would not be detected.p  pIs there a way to scale the appearance of the view according to the device size instead of actually scaling the sprites themselves i.e. the view would stretch out to fit frame size but in reality the sprites would actually be the same size Is this something I would achieve by changing the SKSceneScaleModes from .ResizeFill the one I am currently using p

The black represents how they are supposed to be completed. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commG7QT.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commG7QT.jpg altGoogle Earth Screenshotap  pI am parsing a KML that contains these polygons that are in the form of a LinearRing. They are not always counterclockwise as they are supposed to be so I cant go from that clue.p  pFor the yellow example, I thought about just using the coordinates on the two ends and fixing the longitude and generating latitude values until they matched up. This approach fails for the blue example because of the pole issue but I could flip 180 degrees once I got to the pole. I also am not sure how to decide to go up in latitude or down. Obviously the semicircle opens up towards the north so I would go that way but I cant figure out a reliable test for how it opens because of the red example. It mostly opens up toward the north which is the way it should but the ends start to go south so I couldnt just test the ends because it would look like it is opening up to the south. Is there a way to test to see what direction a parabola mostly opens up towardsp  pSomething that might make it easy is that since it is a geo satellite, it can only see half of the earth centered at 0 degrees latitude. That is why I was thinking of traversing up or down a fixed longitude.p  pAnother thing I was thinking about...could I treat this as a pseudocartesian system since I am a satellite looking at half of the earth. It pretty much resembles an skewed xy system.p  pMy question is, what is the best approach in completing the polygon and preserving the intended beam patternp  pEDIT I could use the end points to calculate a point between the ends and then get the slope of the bisector using a middle point of the original curve. This would give me the direction of how it opens up.p  precodey, x  it opens toward the upper right y, x  it opens toward the upper left y, x  it opens toward the lower right y, x  it opens toward the lower left codepre  pFrom there, I am not sure how to generate the points. Can I just use the longitude of one of the end points and keep that fixed while iterating through latitudes around the globe until it matches the latitude of the other end point I feel like I am oversimplifying it. I would hate to get it working and then realize it was a waste because it only works for a certain test case.p

Negative 34777 pa hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferenceunorderedsetunorderedset relnofollowFrom hereap  blockquote   pPred The unorderedset object uses this expression to determine whether two element keys are equivalent. No two elements in an unorderedset container can have keys that yield true using this predicate.p blockquote  pAnd also from 23.5.6.11p  blockquote   pAn unorderedset is an unordered associative container that supports unique keys strongan unorderedset contains at most one of each key valuestrong and in which the elements keys are the elements themselves. The unorderedset class supports forward iterators.p blockquote  pBut I can bypass this if I define my own hasher and equivalent operation that use different features of a class type. p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltunorderedsetgt for unorderedset and unorderedmultiset  using namespace std  struct A     A  default     Aint a, int b xa, yb      int x  0, y  0    sizet hasherconst A ampsd     return hashltintgtsd.x   bool eqOpconst A amplhs, const A amprhs     return lhs.y  rhs.y    int main      unorderedsetltA, decltypehasher, decltypeeqOpgt unorderedA10, hasher, eqOp      unorderedA.emplace2,3     unorderedA.emplace3,3      forconst autoamp c  unorderedA         cout ltlt c.x ltlt   ltlt c.y ltlt endl  codepre  pOutputsp  precode3 3 2 3 codepre  pI understand whats happening the hasher places each key in different buckets because of their x value. However those two keys shouldve been considered equal by my eqOp function due to their y value, but they never get checked for equivalence since they get placed in different buckets. So is it normal functionality that an unordered container can contain two equivalent keys as long as they enter different buckets. Or is it the responsibility of the coder to make sure the hasher and predicate are written to place equivalent keys in the same bucket Or maybe does my eqOp function violate a rule that the compiler does not detectp  pIn a set and a map its clear the predicate provided to those defines a strict weak ordering and so two keys considered equivalent have only one element associated with them. In an unordered map its not so clear to me two equivalent keys can have different elements associated with them so long as those keys are in different buckets. But those sources above feel like they tell me otherwise. p

Negative 34777 pI have a situation where I need the change the commit message of a previous commit on a branch lets call it BranchA.  I understand that I can change the message using an interactive rebase on that branch codegit rebase i ltcommitnumbergtcode.p  pThe problem is that I have already merged that branch with another local branch BranchB.  So issue is that I would need to change the commit message in both BranchA and BranchB. The merge was performed with fastforwarding disabled e.g. codegit merge noff BranchAcode.p  pAm I correct that git would consider the target commit in these two branches are separate commits The reason I assume git sees the same commit in BranchA and BranchB as separate is because when I updated the commit message in BranchA, the same commit in BranchB remained unchanged.p  pDoes that mean I simply need to perform the interactive rebase on both branches to change the message on each  If I do it this way, will it result in issues later in terms of merging, etc.p

Negative 34777 pI just installed CocoaPods and added a pod to my project in Xcode so that I could use the Google Maps SDK for iOS, and now Im not able to get types or values for any variables in the debugger console. The only way I can see a variables value is through a print statement in the code.p  pIm using Swift 2.0 in Xcode 7.0 beta, and I followed these instructions almost exactly to install the pod into my project a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationiossdkstart relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationiossdkstarta.

Negative 34777 pWe use GIT repos in conjunction with DeployBot.com Deployment Platform and FTP. Code in our repos is organised with topic branches.p  pIn order to deploy code to a server, we simply commit latest changes, merge it with master that branch is used for deployment and the deployment platform transfers the modified files. The above approach works great in 90 of scenarios.p  pHowever, sometimes we need to test our code quickly on the server it is not possible to do that in dev environment but we dont want to commit these small changes every time to keep the repo history compact and clean. We dont also want to use FTP to directly modify files without committing them, since the modified files are out of our control. p  pI am wondering if you have the same problems and what approach you use to overcome it. Initially I was thinking about maintaining a special branch that could be used to keep all these quick onetime commits but I find it not elegantagile and quite problematic.p  pAll ideas are highly appreciated.

The html for this is as followsp  precodelta hreftest classbtn btnbiggtModalltagt lta href runatserver idtest classmodal ariahiddentruegtltagt  ltdiv runatserver iddia classmodaldialoggt lth3gtHow was your experiencelth3gt ltdiv classmodalbodygt ltaspImageButton IDImageButton1 imageURLresourcessmileyface.png runatserver Width75 Height75 gt     ltaspImageButton IDImageButton2 imageURLresourcesneutralface.png runatserver Width75 Height75 gt ltaspImageButton IDImageButton3 imageURLresourcessadface.png runatserver Width75 Height75 gt ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThis produces a button named Modal first a tag and opens the window with a nice transition specified by the CSS.p  pI want to be able to make the popup visible from code behind. Something likep  precodepopup.Visibletrue codepre  pAnd to be able to catch the OnClick events of the three image buttons.p  pCould anyone point me in the right direction Thank you in advance.p
