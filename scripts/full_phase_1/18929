Negative 18929 pWhat are the reasons a malloc would fail, especially in 64 bitp  pMy specific problem is trying to malloc a huge 10GB chunk of RAM on a 64 bit system. The machine has 12GB of RAM, and 32 GB of swap. Yes, the malloc is extreme, but why would it be a problem  This is in Windows XP64 with both Intel and MSFT compilers.  The malloc sometimes succeeds, sometimes doesnt, about 50.  8GB mallocs always work, 20GB mallocs always fail. If a malloc fails, repeated requests wont work, unless I quit the process and start a fresh process again which will then have the 50 shot at success.  No other big apps are running. It happens even immediately after a fresh reboot.p  pI could imagine a malloc failing in 32 bit if you have used up the 32 or 31 bits of address space available, such that theres no address range large enough to assign to your request.p  pI could also imagine malloc failing if you have used up your physical RAM strongandstrong your hard drive swap space. This isnt the case for me.p  pBut why else could a malloc fail I cant think of other reasons.p  pIm more interested in the general malloc question than my specific example, which Ill likely replace with memory mapped files anyway. The failed malloc is just more of a puzzle than anything else... that desire to understand your tools and not be surprised by the fundamentals.p

Negative 18929 pIm using a hrefhttpwww.blackberry.comdevelopersdeveloperlabssendingemailmessages.shtml relnofollowBlackberrys ESSa that includes support for sending an email to its own SMTP server which then pushes the email to the Blackberry device.p  pWhen using Thunderbird to send to this SMTP server, it works perfectly, I can send multiple emails without problems.p  pHowever, when using SmptClient, or a few third party componenets, and finally my own custom class, the email sends just fine, but on sending QUIT the ESS SMTP server seems to crash and subsequent attempts to communicate with it timeout.p  pId like to place a proxy of some sort between Thunderbird and ESS SMTP server to monitor the commands Thunderbird sends and how it handles the connection to the server.p  pI could build something myself, listening on a local port and pointing Thunderbird to that port, but I figured someone on SO mightve used something similar in the past.p  pDoes anyone know of an existing app that would achieve this, or a different approach I could takep  pThe issue is consistent. Thunderbird consistently works and my own attempts consistently fail, so I feel confident its something these .NET components arent doing that Thunderbird is. I should point out that ESS SMTP server isnt exactly wellwritten, it seems to return incorrect status codes to some commands pretty much 250 in response to everything but because it works perfectly with Thunderbird, Im confident there must be a way to get it to work from within .NET.p

Negative 18929 pI am working on an application that will need to read tons of records close to 500,000 from one table and insert them into another set of tables in the same database.  I though about using SSIS package for this but our DBAs dont want to use that.  Now, I am thinking of a multithreaded approach.  I am thinking that I can have a few thread started that will read say 500 records at a time and insert them, then come back and read more.p  pNow, say I spawn off 3 threads of this application.  The first thread reads 500 rows and starts processing them.  Can I lock these rows that were already read so that the next thread does not pick them up  I am trying to find some articles regarding this on the internet, but perhaps I am not searching for the correct terms in Google.p  pAny ideas  or links to articles that might be helpfulp

Negative 18929 pMy shared hosting account with a number of websites was compromised. Some malware on my PC, which I probably got through downloading a PDF file, found all my FTP passwords and happily went about its business of inserting some code into all index. files on the server. I now got rid of this malware, and I am ready to change all FTP passwords as soon as I have repaired the damage done. p  pI do have some backups, but not of everything and not all recent. So I thought the simplest and quickest way to restore everything would be to repair all index.html files in all folders. However, because I use Joomla where every folder has a index.html file to prevent directory listing, there are thousands of those files. So, I need to use an automated tool.p  olliOne option is to search and replace the inserted strings in all index.html files, but I dont think that will work because the strings are different across files.li liAnother option is to simply replace all content in index.html files by what I know should be the proper content.li liA third option would be to replace all index.html files by a copy of what I know to be the proper file.li ol  pA bit to my surprise I havent found a script yet that does option 2 or 3. I did find all sorts of programs or scripts that do part of the job searchampreplace strings, recursively go through a directory tree, etc but unfortunately I am not able to combine those into one working solution.p  pPreferably the solution would be a php or other script working on the server, so that I do not need to download everything and can do it using FTP and cPanel as my only tools.p  pFrom what I have researched, I am not the only victim of this malware. So a solution would also help other Joomla users. Moreover, if a solution would be able to work with custom filenames e.g. index2.php to be replaced by selected files as templates to be copied, anyone who falls victim using any sort of php file would be helped by a solution. Apparently an increase in the number of victims is expected.p  pDoes anyone know of a php script that would be a solution for me, or would anyone be able to create onep  pAssuming a solution is found, does anyone have a blog where it could be posted and found by othersp  pMany many thanks in advancep  pPS I should note that the malware actually changes any file named index and apparently also default.

Negative 18929 pIve spent some time today playing with getting the source for python 3.1.1 to build on my MacBook Pro using the enableframework and enableuniversalsdk options with no success. I will humbly admit that I have no real clue why I cant compile 3.1.1 on Snow Leopard, I did make sure to get the new Xcode version for Snow Leopard, and made sure I also installed the 10.4u SDK. It seems to be choking on the 10.4 SDK during the make stage, and has several error regarding headers for wchar, cursor, and ncursor during the configure stage. I have been able to get a make from a plain configure, and most the test pass, but that just isnt challenging enough. Has anyone else attempted to build python 3.1.1 on a Mac running Snow Leopardp

Negative 18929 pIm looking at some legacy VB6 code yearsyears old, before my time which runs a query against an SQL 2005 db.

Negative 18929 pLets say I have a server program that can accept connections from 10 or more different clients.  The clients send data at random which is received by the server, but it is certain that at least one client will be sending data every update.  The server cannot wait for information to arrive because it has other processing to do.  Aside from using asynchronous sockets, I see two optionsp  ol lipMake all sockets nonblocking.  In a loop, call coderecvcode on each socket and allow it to fail with codeWSAEWOULDBLOCKcode if there is no data available and if I happen to get some data, then keep it.pli lipLeave the sockets as blocking.  Add all sockets to a codeFDSETcode and call codeselectcode.  If the return value is nonzero which it will be most of the time, loop through all the sockets to find the appropriate number of readable sockets with codeFDISSETcode and only call coderecvcode on the readable sockets.pli ol  pThe first option will create a lot more calls to the coderecvcode function.  The second method is a bigger pain from a programming perspective because of all the codeFDSETcode and codeFDISSETcode looping.p  pWhich method or another method is preferred  Is avoiding the overhead on letting coderecvcode fail on a nonblocking socket worth the hassle of calling codeselectcodep  pI think I understand both methods and I have tried both with success, but I dont know if one way is considered better or optimal.p

Negative 18929 pAfter an incident at work where I misused String.IsNullOrEmpty with a Session variable, a fellow coworker of mine now refuses to accept my usage of String.IsNullOrEmpty. After some research, apparently theres a bug listed for IsNullOrEmpty on MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.string.isnullorempty28VS.8029.aspxlinka read note at the bottom p  blockquote   pAs of April 4, 2006, there is a bug   possible in the JIT that makes this   method fail when optimizations are   turned on. It is known to affect both   C and VB.p blockquote  pMore information can be found here a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackViewFeedback.aspxFeedbackID113102linka. Microsoft the bug is supposedly fixed postOrcas, but unfortunately my employer still uses VS2005. But if the problem is fixed in 2008 so be it. Thats just fine with me.p  pWhile my colleagues refusal of my code with IsNullOrEmpty to me is blind ignorance IMO he certainly cant tell me why emnotem to use it other than the misuse with the session variable. Ive used IsNullOrEmpty all over our code with no issues whatsoever. Personally, I find it much more readable in addition of doing two things in one statement. p  pAfter googling for opinions on the subject, Ive found sites that take the proscon stance. Here are some of the sites Ive read about thisp  pa hrefhttpcs.rthand.comblogsblog5Fwith5Frighthandarchive200606221063.aspxhttpcs.rthand.comblogsblogwithrighthandarchive200606221063.aspxa p  pa hrefhttpwww.omegacoder.comp105httpwww.omegacoder.comp105ap  pOne site a hrefhttpdotnetperls.comisnulloremptyhttpdotnetperls.comisnulloremptya sums up the method IMHO pretty well p  blockquote   pHere we looked that IsNullOrEmpty   method on the string type, which   provides us with a good and relatively   efficient method of checking whether a   string is OK to save or use. However,   for performance, it may be better to   use manual null checks. Empty strings   can also be tested in other ways, and   my research here shows that checking   length is fastest.p blockquote  pAssuming the bug fix is in place and working correctly in VS20082010etc., is there any reason emnotem to use String.IsNullOrEmpty with VS2005 and beyond I realize this may seem a little overkill over such a silly little method, but Id like to know if theres more behind the scenes going on and if anyone has alternative explanations.p

Negative 18929 pI have a complex gradle script that wraps up a load of functionality around building and deploying a number of netbeans projects to a number of environments.p  pThe script works very well, but in essence it is all configured through half a dozen maps holding project and environment information.p  pI want to abstract the tasks away into another file, so that I can simply define my maps in a simple build file, and import the tasks from the other file. In this way, I can use the same core tasks for a number of projects and configure those projects with a simple set of maps.p  pCan anyone tell me how I can import one gradle file into another, in a similar manner to Ants  task Ive trawled Gradles docs to no avail so far.p  pstrongAdditional Infostrongp  pAfter Toms response below, I thought Id try and clarify exactly what I mean.p  pBasically I have a gradle script which runs a number of subprojects. However, the subprojects are all Netbeans projects, and come with their own ant build scripts, so I have tasks in gradle to call each of these.p  pMy problem is that I have some configuration at the top of the file, such asp  precodeprojects  [     [nameMySubproject1, shortname sub1, envmainEnv, cvsmodulemod1],     [nameMySubproject2, shortname sub2, envaltEnv, cvsmodulemod2] ] codepre  pI then generate tasks such asp  precodeprojects.each     task checkoutit.shortname ltlt            Code to for example check module out from cvs using config from it.       codepre  pI have many of these sort of task generation snippets, and all of them are generic  they entirely depend on the config in the projects list.p  pSo what I want is a way to put this in a separate script and import it in the following sort of wayp  precodeprojects  [     [nameMySubproject1, shortname sub1, envmainEnv, cvsmodulemod1],     [nameMySubproject2, shortname sub2, envaltEnv, cvsmodulemod2] ]  importtasks.gradle  This will import and run the script so that all tasks are generated for the projects given above. codepre  pSo in this example, tasks.gradle will have all the generic task generation code in, and will get run for the projects defined in the main build.gradle file. In this way, tasks.gradle is a file that can be used by all large projects that consist of a number of subprojects with Netbeans ant build files.p

Negative 18929 pAs a disclaimer Id like to state that Im fairly new to ObjectiveC and Cocoa. Currently Im trying to write a basic application that can POST XML data to a particular endpoint. To achieve this, Ive created a ServiceRouter class which uses NSURLConnection to post XML data to a particular URL. p  pThe ServiceRouter class is intended as a base for subclasses which contain webservicespecific XML queries. In the example below, I subclass ServiceRouter to create a ServiceImplementation class.p  pWhen its time to generate and POST the XML, I create an instance of the ServiceImplementation class like sop  precode[[ServiceImplementation alloc] createServiceSpecificXML] codepre  pThis all seems to work fine. The issue is that Leaks reports a number of issues. Being fairly inexperienced, Im not really sure where to start. For the most part, the NSURLConnection code is lifted from Apples documentation. p  pFollowing basic memory management rules, I imagine I will have to release my ServiceImplementation instance at some point. What Im confused about is how this should be handled given the asynchronous nature of NSURLConnection.

One to class emAem another to class emBem . emAem does not know about emBem and vise versa.p  pemAem does some calculations and at the end it puts 3 floats into the clipboard. Next, emBem pulls from clipboard the 3 floats, and does its own calculations.

This vector can have more than 1000 values and I dont want to use the clipboard to transfer it to emBem as it will become time consumer, even bottleneck, since this behavior repeats step by step.p  pSimple solution is that emBem will know emAem set a pointer to emAem.

But since sometimes only half of the image had changed some objects remained in their old position, it may perhaps be benefitial to redraw only those regions.

The solution typically includes one or more projects contained in the Libraries hierarchy, and those library projects are usually included in multiple solutions. In perforce this seems to work fine as long as I apply source control to individual projects as opposed to entire solutions. In fact, either the perforce plugin, or visual studio itself, gives me a warning if I try to source control solutions that share common projectslibraries.p  pThe problems start happening when I try to branch solutions. Since Im not source controlling the entire solution, the .sln file is not copied to the branch directory, which I suspect is would be useless anyway due to incorrect file mappings. My question is, am I doing something wrong or is branching of visual studio solutions always this painful Is there a better way Perforce seems work well only for simple solutions.

All is as you would expect and the performance is good.p  pThe problem is that, after a user moves, resizes and rotates a UIView, I want to let them tap it and give them handles that allow for resizing other than the square resizing that pinching gives i.e., when you use the pinch gesture, you upsize or downsize in the same ratio for both x and y. Now, even with the code above, the values that are stored arent ever quite accurate. p  pThe handles Im using are simply 10x10 dots that are supposed to go at each corner and halfway down each side of the UIViews framerectangle. When I first place a square and tap it to get the handles before doing anything else, the handles appear in the appropriate place. When I move, resize and rotate an object, then tap it, the handles are all shifted off of the shape some amount. It generally seems to be about 20 pixels.p  pAre the values in the UIGestureRecognizer objects just not accurate enough That doesnt seem to be the case, because those values are used to change the object onscreen, and that is accurate.p  pIm pretty sure theres no way for me to get a real representation of the UIViews frame after messing with it so much, but wheres the flaw in my custom code thats giving me bad values Am I losing precision when converting between degrees and radiansp  pOn a related note Apple obviously has internal code that keeps track of how to draw a view thats been translatedtransformed. The box of solid color that Im currently using is moved, zoomed and rotated correctly. So, is there any way to access the values that they use for displayed a translatedtransformed UIViewp  pThanksp
Negative 18929 pIm getting some funky behavior with session variables with Razor .cshtml pages.  Essentially on some pages I check to see if a Session variable is set, and if not I set it.  I keep getting a null object reference.p  pI believe this is because ultimately Razor is designed for MVC, and I did a little reading about the MVC life cycle and apparently the session object is injected a a different point in the lifecyde then say asp.net webforms.  So When I try to use it on my pages it isnt available yet.p  pSo my question would be for simple sites based with Razor not MVC yet, but moving that way what would be an effective way to check if a session variable is set like say access level that is checked fairly often.  That would be part one of the question.p  pPart two of the question would be if this is bad practice, what then should I be doing to replace this approachp  pThank you for your input.p

Negative 18929 pIm trying to password protect a submit button on a form Im building in Microsoft Access 2003. The button, when clicked, will add a new record to my database. The idea of the password protection is that when the user clicks the button, a prompt will appear asking for a password. They can either enter the password and click OK to proceed with verifying it has been entered properly, or they can click Cancel and close the prompt window after which they will receive an confirmation alert. If the password matches what is hardcoded, the record will be added. If the password is not a match, an error message will display.p  pThis should be easy enough. However, the record will ALWAYS be added to the database, no matter if the password is entered incorrectly, no password is entered, or the user cancels out of the password window.

Negative 18929 pSo I have the mostly vilified codedefine MAX a, b   a gt b  a  b code somewhere in a program yes, yes, I know. At some point in the code there is a comparison codeXgt1code, where X is as far as I can tell a signed integer. The line is codej  MAXbmGs[i], bmBc[inty[i  j]]  m  1  icode, where codeycode here is a codecharcode. Not necessarily surprisingly, I find that the macro is returning code1code as the larger number Im guessing too long a number for codeintcode or an codeunsignedcode issue, but I cant find it. I would like to know techniques you guys may have for finding these kinds of errors.p  pNotice that Im not asking for programming advice about whether or not to use that macro, Im sure folks are dying to tell me I should refrain from things like that, but the question is going somewhere else.p  pThanks.p

Negative 18929 pThere are many JavaScript frameworks out there that allow you to work with the DOM before the page has completely loaded. Often youll see the html or body tag manipulated in such a way as to determine if the users agent has JavaScript support or not. p  pFor example, the html tag will have a class of nojs and when teh DOM is ready, that class name is updated to be js instead, thus allowing the front end developer to style the page in two ways  one with JavaScript support and the other in a way that will display the data properly when JavaScript is not supported.p  pThis works fine, however there is always a bit of lag and youll often see the screen jump when the updated class naming function is run from nojs to js as a result of the differently styling applied to a JSsupported version of the site.p  pThis has always annoyed me, and it can really look ugly if there is a lot of JavaScriptbased interactivity on the page.p  pLong story short, my intent was to find a solution that would do this quicker than the ondomready event. The solution I came up with was to run the following statement immediately after the opening body tagp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgtlt[CDATA[ var elBody  document.getElementsByTagNamebody[0] elBody.className  elBody.className.replacenew RegExpnojsb, js]]gtltscriptgt codepre  pThis appears to work great.

Negative 18929 pFirst to thank you all for your great help, I have finally published my game puzzle, both full and free version. Not sure how would I do it without Stackoverflow. I also learned a lot by helping others.p  pThe issue I am having is that when I start applications I have developed, on Samsung Galaxy Tab, animations are jerky at first 10 seconds or so, then they become smooth. This is not the case on HTC desire or Samsung Europe mobile.p  pIt does not matter whether the animation is a frame by frame canvas drawing or built in android view animations. p  pI wonder if there is something I can do to prevent this slow down is it something to do the way Galaxy Tab buffers when loading an application and optimising the resources Or is this to do with the fact that it has a higher resolution screen or both.p  pOne way to deal with this could be to create some kind of animated intro in the same activity which would preloadoptimise Galaxy Tab for the game. p  pemEDIT after few months of developmentemp  pstrongWhen testing an app on Galaxy Tab it starts slow and the animation is jerky, but if I  restart the app andor unplug the USB link, then it run fast as it should.strongp

All of these dependencies make unit testing the controller a pain.p  pOne possible approach to solving this would be to make the view model class do the loading which would require a custom model binder to instantiate them using the IoC container to provide the repository dependency. Is this a good optionp  pAnother approach that I think would be good is hinted at in a hrefhttpcodecampserver.codeplex.com relnofollowCodeCampServera but is incomplete and commented out involving attributes on the field in the view modelp  precode[SelectListProvidedtypeofAllDaysSelectListProvider] public IEnumerableltSelectListItemgt DayTypes  get set  codepre  phowever I am struggling to figure out how this could be implemented in a way that would not require some major replumbing of the MVC framework.p  pHow do you solve this problem p  pEDIT I want to keep with strongly typed views and avoid stuffing the data into view data.p  pFURTHER EDIT I would also like a solution that is ideally model independent, by which I mean if the same reference data is needed by multiple view models this can be achieved with a single piece of code. Matts approach is interesting but is tightly coupled to the view model.p

Negative 18929 pI am using PowerMock to mock static methods on codeJOptionPanecode, but the JRE doesnt seem to be very conform with it, because I get a codejava.lang.VerifyErrorcode at initialisation, as it checks the integrity of its own packages and classes.p  pI have though of a few workarounds, but Im not very happy with any of themp  ul lipWrite an object wrapper for codeJOptionPanecode and provide an interface for the methods I need codeshowInputDialogcode, etc., so I can inject a mock or an stub for testing.

The downside is that I will get lots of warnings of the kind invoking static method on an instance variable, but thats the price to pay.strikepli lipDo not mock codeJOptionPanecode at all and use codeRobotcode to fire the input events to handle it.

Negative 18929 pHoping for an answer by the incredibly wise Romain Guy but would love an answer from anyone who has any ideas.p  pBefore, he wrote the following in response to a user asking a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5085990whyisntgraphicsaccelerationturnedonbydefaultinhoneycombwhy HW acceleration wasnt enabled by defaultap  blockquote   pIt is not turned on by default for   compatibility reasons. Not 100 of the   Canvas API is supported when turned on   although the missing parts are very   few and rarely used and there might   be bugs in the new implementation.   There are also new constraints for   instance if you try to draw a bitmap   larger than the maximum OpenGL texture   size, it will fail.p      pThe new rendering pipeline also uses   native display lists for each View,   which triggers bugs in some apps. For   instance, if a View relies on its   parent to invalidate to redraw   itself, its a bug in the app, but it   works without hardware acceleration.   It will however not work with hardware   acceleration on.p      pOur goal is to make hardware   acceleration on by default as soon as   possible but we do not want to break   apps. That said, apps using standard   views and APIs should work just fine.p blockquote  pI was wondering if there is any way to force Honeycombs hardware acceleration to be turned on by default on a rooted Honeycomb device. Despite the potential issues, I am still interested in giving it a shot. I gave the build.prop a cursory glance and couldnt find anything.

Negative 18929 pIm writing a sound system for a game Im planning to start.  Im working on Android 2.2, and I followed the tutorial a hrefhttpwww.droidnova.comcreatingsoundeffectsinandroidpart1,570.html relnofollowherea.  The app works fine when the SoundPool is accessed directly from the SoundManager class.  I created another class called Sound, that serves as a wrapper for the SoundPool, which is accessed through the SoundManager.  When I use my sound class, suddenly the app doesnt work.  If I debug, Ill find the warning SoundPool sample  not READY.  Its odd to me that the sample wouldnt be ready when going through my wrapper class, but would load up fine going directly through SoundManager.p  pI realize that there is a callback class a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidmediaSoundPool.OnLoadCompleteListener.html relnofollowOnLoadCompleteListenera specifically designed to wait for the sample to load, however I tried an implementation of that method, and while the load status came back 0 success, I found that I was getting the same error and the sound would not play.p  pHere is my code currently Ive snipped out logging and some other methods for readabilityp  pstrongTest classstrongp  precodepublic class SoundTutorial extends Activity      private SoundManager mSoundManager       Called when the activity is first created.

However, if you only have an object and it is not null, can you determine if it is actually a Nullable ValueTypep  pIn other words, is there a better way than checking every possible nullable value type individually to determine if a boxed struct is a value typep  precodevoid Main     Console.WriteLineCode.IsNullableStructCode.BoxedNullable     public static class Code     private static readonly int nullableInteger  43      public static bool IsNullableStructobject obj                   ifobj  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptionobj                   ifobj.GetType.IsValueType return false                   return IsNullablePrimitiveobj                  public static bool IsNullablePrimitiveobject obj          return obj is byte  obj is sbyte  obj is short  obj is ushort  obj is int  obj is uint  obj is long  obj is ulong  obj is float  obj is double  obj is char  obj is decimal  obj is bool  obj is DateTime  obj is TimeSpan           public static object BoxedNullable         get return nullableInteger        codepre  pp  h2Updateh2  pI found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms36678928vVS.9029.aspx relnofollowthis article at MSDNa, and it says you cant determine if a type is a Nullable struct via a call to codeGetTypecode.  p  pp  h2Update 2h2  pApparently the method I suggested doesnt work either because codeint x  4 Console.WriteLinex is intcode is True.

Negative 18929 pI am trying to increase the speed of some UI Automation operations. I stumbled across the not so well documented caching possibility.p  pFrom what I have understood, the whole operation if you have a large GUItree is so slow, because for every single function call there has to be a processchange kind of like going to kernelmode, I suppose, speedwise. So.. in comes caching.p  pSimply tell the function to cache an element and its children, and then work on it lightningfast. From what I understand, you only have one contextchange, and assemble all the data you need in one go.p  pGood idea, but.. it is just as slow for me as the uncached variation. I wrote some simple testcode, and could not see an improvement.p  precodeAutomationElement ae  element whose siblings are to be examined, thre are quite a few siblings AutomationElement sibling  region noncached watch.Start for int i  0 i lt 10 i      sibling  TreeWalker.RawViewWalker.GetFirstChildTreeWalker.RawViewWalker.GetParentae     while sibling  null              sibling  TreeWalker.RawViewWalker.GetNextSiblingsibling       watch.Stop System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineExecution time without cache   watch.ElapsedMilliseconds   ms. endregion  region cached watch.Reset watch.Start  CacheRequest cacheRequest  new CacheRequest cacheRequest.TreeScope  TreeScope.Children  TreeScope.Element  for testing I chose a minimal set AutomationElement parent  for int j  0 j lt 10 j      using cacheRequest.Activate              parent  TreeWalker.RawViewWalker.GetParentae, cacheRequest          int cnt  parent.CachedChildren.Count     for int i  0 i lt cnt i              sibling  parent.CachedChildren[i]       watch.Stop System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineExecution time parentcache   watch.ElapsedMilliseconds   ms. endregion codepre  pThe setup is you get an element and want to check on all its many siblings.

Negative 18929 pI have some database table, lets say CarTb, and a front end that lets you browse second hand cars available for sale.p  pIn the front end I can filter on as little or as much as I like  show me all blue cars, show me all red cars with 4 doors, show me all cars with rego number XXX123 OR ipod capability and a five speaker stereo. etc.p  pWhat I want to be able to do on the Java back end is build a system that queries the database dynamically based upon what the UI sends me. Im wondering if it is possible to dynamically inject a whole string of arguments into a stored proc... Obviously I know you can map individual arguments like doors and colour and then substitute in the values... But what about variable arguements, almost like Java vargs I suppose.p  pYoud always be doing a select  from CarTb, its just the where clause could be any of the following...p  ul liWHERE doors4li liWHERE doors5 AND colourRED AND MP3Yli liWHERE turboY OR blownYli ul  pYou get the idea.p  pAny suggestions We do have access to hibernate if that helps, and the sybase database ie we can write another stored proc to do this if necessary.p  pCheers, Davep

The word superstition in this context doesnt refer to a program that gives you   the creeps or generates extra errors when the moon is full. It means substituting   feelings about the code for understanding. If you often find yourself suspecting   that the compiler or the hardware made an error, youre still in the realm of   superstition. Only about 5 percent of all errors are hardware, compiler, or   operatingsystem errors Ostrand and Weyuker 1984. Programmers who have   moved into the realm of understanding always suspect their own work first   because they know that they cause 95 percent of errors. Understand the role of   each line of code and why its needed. Nothing is ever right just because it seems   to work. If you dont know why it works, it probably doesntyou just dont   know it yet.br   strongSteve McConnell Code Completestrongp blockquote

Negative 18929 pIm a creating a loading screen for website I am making. The website loads many images, scripts, etc. The HTML and CSS part is great, but I need a way to guarantee that the loading... image will be loaded before anything else.p  pIm using jQuery, and everything is initiated within codefunction   ... code. I imagine that the code for this would need to be called beforeoutside that block, and the code to remove the loading screen will be called at the very end of that block. Currently, the loading image is set as a DIV background, which is the way I prefer it. However, if its completely necessary, I will settle for an IMG tag.p  pstrongUpdate solutionstrongp  pI was able to answer my own question by using a combination of Robin and Vlads responses. Both were very good, and excellent answers, however the problem is that they were aimed to load an image before another image, rather than load an image before anything else.

The CSS and JS files dont begin to load, until theyve been inserted into the head tag. This is exactly what I want.p  pIm predicting that I may begin to have some problems, however, when I begin to load a list of files. Chrome reports that sometimes the JS file is loaded first, but the majority of the time the CSS file is loaded first. This isnt a problem, except when I begin to add files to load, I will need to ensure that jQuery is loaded before a script file that uses jQuery.p  pIf anyone has a solution for this, or a way to detect when the CSSJS files are finished loading, using this method, then please comment. Though, Im not sure that its going to be a problem yet. I may need to ask a new question in the future about this, if I start to run into problems.p  pThank you to every who has helped with this issue.p  pstrongUpdate glitch fixstrongp  pI ended up running into a lot of problem with this method, because the script files were being loaded asynchronously.

Negative 18929 pIn my program, written in C, I need to take a set of strings, each containing the declaration of a C function, and perform a number of operations on them.p  pOne of the operations is to compare whether one function is equal to another. To do that I plan to just prune away comments and intermediate whitespace which has no effect on the semantics of the function and then do a string comparison. However, I would like to retain whitespace within a string as removing that would change the output produced by the function.p  pI could write some code which iterates over the string characters and enters string mode whenever a quote codecode is encountered and recognize escaped quotes, but I wonder if there is any better way of doing this. An idea is to use a fullfledged C parser, run it over the function string, ignore all comments and excessive whitespace, and then convert the AST back to a string again. But looking around at some C parser I get the feeling that most are a bitch to integrate with my source code prove me wrong if I am. Perhaps I could try to use codeyacccode or something and use an existing C grammar and implement the parser myself...p  pSo, any ideas on the best way to do thisp  h2EDITh2  pThe program Im writing takes an abstract model and converts it into C code. The model consists of a graph, where the nodes may or may not contain segments of C code more precisely, a C function definition where its execution must be completely deterministic i.e. no global state and no memory operations are allowed. The program does pattern matching on the graph and merges and splits certain nodes who adhere to these patterns. However, these operations can only be performed if the nodes exhibit the same functionality i.e. if their C function definitions are the same. This checking that they are the same will be done by simply comparing the strings which contain the C function declarations. If they are characterbycharacter identical, then they are equal.p  pDue to the nature of how the models are generated, this is quite a reasonable method of comparison emprovidedem that the comments and excess whitespace is removed as this is the only factor that may differ. This is the problem Im facing  how to do this with minimal amount of implementation effortp

Negative 18929 pIm working on an app in JavaScipt, jQuery, PHP amp MySQL that consists of 100 lessons. I am trying to think of an efficient way to store the status of each users progress through the lessons, without having to query the MySQL database too much.p  pRight now, I am thinking the easiest implementation is to create a table for each user, and then store each lessons status in that table. The only problem with that is if I add new lessons, I would have to update every users table.p  pThe second implementation I considered would be to store each lesson as a table, and record the user ID for each user that completed that lesson there  but then generating a status report what lessons a user completed, how well they did, etc. would mean pulling data from 100 tables.p  pIs there an obvious solution I am missing How would you store your users progress through 100 lessons, so its quick and simple to generate a status report showing their process.p  pCheersp

Negative 18929 pstrongShort Versionstrongp  pI have an application which utilizes a plugin infrastructure. The plugins have configurable properties that help them know emhowem to do their job. The plugins are grouped into profiles to define how to complete a task, and the profiles are stored in XML files serialized by the DataContractSerializer. The problem is when reading the configuration files, the application deserializing has to have knowledge of all of the plugins defined in the configuration file. Im looking for a way to handle the resolution of unknown plugins. See the proposed solution section below for a couple of the ideas Ive looked into implementing, but I am open to just about anything though Id rather not have to reinvent the application. p  hr  pstrongDetailstrongp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve developed a sort of Business Process Automation System for internal use for the company Im currently working for in C 4. It makes exhaustive use of plugins to define emeverythingem from the tasks that are to be performed to the definition of units of work and relies heavily on a dynamic configuration model which in turn relies on C 4DLR dynamic objects to fulfill jobs. Its a little heavy while executing because of its dynamic nature but it works consistently and performs well enough for our needs.p  pIt includes a WinForms configuration UI that uses Reflection extensively to determine the configurable propertiesfields of the plugins, as well as, the propertiesfields that define each unit of work to be processed. The UI is also built on top of the BPA engine so it has a thorough understanding of the loose object model put in place that allows the engine to do its job, which, coincidentally, has led to several user experience improvements, such as, adhoc job execution and configuretime validation of user input. Again there is room for improvement, however, it seems to do its job.p  pThe configuration UI utilizes the DataContractSerializer to serializedeserialize the settings specified, so any plugins referenced by the configuration must be loaded before or at the time of configuration load.p  pstrongStructurestrongp  pThe BPA engine is implemented as a shared assembly DLL which is referenced by the BPA service a Windows Service, the Configuration UI WinForms app, and a plugin tester Console application version of the Windows Service. Each of the three applications that reference the shared assembly only include the minimum amount of code necessary to perform their specific purpose. Additionally, all plugins must reference a very thin assembly which basically just defines the interfaces that the plugin must implement.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pBecause of the extensibility model used in the application, there has always been a requirement that the config UI is run from the same directory on the same PC as the Service application. That way the UI always knows about all of the assemblies that the Service knows about so they can be deserialized without running into missing assemblies. Now that we are getting close to roll out of the system, a demand to allow the Configuration UI remotely on any PC in our network has come about from our network admins for security purposes. Typically this wouldnt be a problem if there was always a known set of assemblies to deploy, however, with the ability to extend the application using user built assemblies, there has to be a way to resolve the assemblies from which the plugins can be instantiatedused.p  pstrongProposed potentially obvious Solutionstrongp  pAdd a WCF service to the Service application to allow the typical CRUD operations against the configurations which that instance of the service is aware of and rework the configuration UI to act more like SSMS with a ConnectDisconnect model. This doesnt really solve the problem so we would also need to expose some sort of ServiceContract from the Service application to allow querying of the assemblies it knows abouthas access to. Thats fine and fairly straight forward however the question arises, When should the UI find out about the assemblies that the Service is aware of On connect we could send all of the assemblies from the Service to the UI to ensure that it always knows about all of the assemblies the service does but that gets messy with AppDomain management potentially unnecessarily and assembly version conflicts. So I suggested hooking into the AppDomain.AssemblyResolveAppDomain.TypeResolve events to only download the assemblies that the client isnt aware of yet and only as needed. This doesnt necessarily cleanup the AppDomain management issues but it definitely helps address the version conflicts and related issues.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIf youve stuck with me this long I applaud and thank you, but now Im finally getting to the actual question here. After months of research and finally coming to a conclusion I am wondering if anyone here has had to deal with a similar issue and how you dealt with the pitfalls and shortcomings Is there a standard way of handling this that I have missed completely, or do you have any recommendations based on how you have seen this successfully handled in the past Do you see any problems with the proposed approaches or can you offer an alternativep  pIm aware that not everyone lives in my head so please let me know if you need further clarificationexplanation. Thanksp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve given MEF a fair shake and feel that it is too simplistic for my purposes. Its not that it couldnt be bent to handle the plugin requirements of my application, the problem is doing so would be too cumbersome and dirty to make it feasible. It is a nice suggestion and it has a lot of potential, but in its current state it just isnt there yet.p  pAny other ideas or feedback on my proposed solutionsp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI dont know if the issue Im encountering is just too localized, if I failed to properly describe what I am trying to achieve, or if this question is just too unreasonably long to be read in its entirety but the few answers Ive received have been subtly helpful enough to help me think through the problem differently and identify some shortcomings in what I am after.p  pIn short, what Im trying to do is take three applications which in their current state share information configurationassemblies using a common directory structure, and try to make those applications work across a network with minimal impact on usability and architecture. p  pFile shares seem like the obvious answer to this problem as SimonMourier proposed in the comments, but using them translates into lack of control and debugability strongwhenstrong something goes wrong. I can see them as a viable short term solution, but long term they just dont seem feasible.p

Negative 18929 pI have seen various implementations for Entity Framework using unit of work and repository patterns. ideally I want to use interfaces for unit of work, database context, repository for both generic and specific repositories and instantiate them in the BootStrapper code on application startup. Is this actually possiblep  psamples checkedp  pa hrefhttpmicrosoftnlayerapp.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpmicrosoftnlayerapp.codeplex.coma doesnt have any separate unit of work class, the database context itself implements IUnitOfworkp  pa hrefhttpefmvc.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpefmvc.codeplex.coma uses a database factory to instantiate database context without utilising DI and database context does not implement interfacep  pa hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comASPNETMVCApplicationb01a9fe8 relnofollowhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comASPNETMVCApplicationb01a9fe8a instantiates database context and the repositories inside unit of work without any DIp  psome implementations dont use any interface for database context and some instantiate database context and the repositories inside the UnitOfWork class and pass concrete context class in the constructor and some pass the interface for unit of work in the constructor for repository and it is totally confusing. Is there one best practice approach that allows DI and TDD when using Entity Framework 4.1 Is there a sample that demonstrates thisp
Negative 18929 pI am having trouble with the AJAX ModalPopupExtender control. What I am trying to do is click a button, trigger a postcode lookup using Yahoo API with the button click event, display this in an asp panel in the ShowModalDialog box, and then close the dialog. I also need a separate button on the page to submit information using a form that is completely separate from this. p  pI have set the target button up as followsp  precodeltaspButton IDbtnStockist runatserver BackColor2C3473 OnClickbtnStockistClick gt codepre  pThe modalpopup is as followsp  precodeltajaxModalPopupExtender IDmpeStockist runatserver okcontrolidbtnOkay targetcontrolidbtnStockist popupcontrolidpnlDisplay                              popupdraghandlecontrolidPopupHeader dragtrue backgroundcssclassModalPopupBG gtltajaxModalPopupExtendergt  codepre  pWhat is actually happening is that when clicking the target button, the popup opens but the event does not trigger no postcode lookup is done. However, clicking the separate, unrelated button on the same page DOES trigger the event, and the lookup works perfectly. I am able to close the dialog as normal. I have tried hiding the target button with CSS as a quick workaround, but the problem is that any other buttons on the page seem to trigger the lookup method and modalpopup no matter what their click event is programmed to do, and I need them to work separately.p  pIn case its of any use, the panel code is herep  precodeltaspPanel IDpnlDisplay styledisplaynone runatservergt                 ltdiv classPopupContainergt                     ltdiv classPopupBodygt                                                 ltdiv aligncentergtLocal Suppliersltdivgt                         ltbr gtltbr gt                         ltasplabel IDlblError runatservergtltasplabelgt                         ltaspUpdatePanel IDupAlternatives runatserver UpdateModeConditionalgt                             ltContentTemplategt                             ltaspDataList IDdlStockistSelect runatservergt                                 ltHeaderTemplategt                                     lttable cellpadding5 width680gt                                         lttrgt                                             lttdgtNamelttdgt                                             lttdgtAddresslttdgt                                             lttdgtTownCitylttdgt                                             lttdgtMiles Approxlttdgt                                                                                                                 lttrgt                                 ltHeaderTemplategt                                 ltItemTemplategt                                     lttrgt                                         lttdgtlt DataBinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, CNAM gtlttdgt                                         lttdgtlt DataBinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, CADD1 gtlttdgt                                         lttdgtlt DataBinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, CADD3gtlttdgt                                                                         lttd aligncentergtlt DataBinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, Distancegtlttdgt                                                               lttrgt                                 ltItemTemplategt                                 ltFooterTemplategt                                     lttablegt                                             ltFooterTemplategt                             ltaspDataListgt                             ltContentTemplategt                         ltaspUpdatePanelgt                         ltaspLinkButton IDbtnOkay runatserver visibletrue TextClose CommandNameUpdate BorderColorFFFFFF BackColor000000                              BorderWidth3 BorderStyleDouble ForeColorWhite FontSize13pt stylecursor pointer padding 1px 15px 1px 15px                              margintop 10px FontUnderlineFalsegtltaspLinkButtongt                      ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltaspPanelgt codepre  pThanks in advance for the helpp

Negative 18929 pWhat I thought would be a fairly straightforward layout is not turning out to be.p  pI have several rows in a linear layout.p  pEach row has a title, a tag and a description.p  pThe description appears below the title and tag and is no problem.p  pThe title is of indeterminate length and should be aligned to top left.  The tag should appear appear aligned to the right of the title not necessarily the right edge of the parent, if the title is short.  If theres not enough room for both on a single line, the title should wrap and leave space for the tag.p  pThe tag has its own style and behavior, and must be a separate element from the title.p  pIn my limited experience, Ive had the most luck with RelativeLayouts, so that was my first tryp  precodeimport android.content.Context import android.widget.RelativeLayout import android.widget.TextView  public class ExampleRow extends RelativeLayout       private TextView title     private TextView description     private TextView tag      public ExampleRowContext context           supercontext          LayoutParams lp                  lp  new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT         title  new TextViewcontext         title.setId1         addViewtitle, lp                           lp  new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT         lp.addRuleRelativeLayout.BELOW, title.getId         description  new TextViewcontext         description.setId2         addViewdescription, lp                 lp  new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT         lp.addRuleRelativeLayout.RIGHTOF, title.getId         lp.addRuleRelativeLayout.ABOVE, description.getId         lp.setMargins20, 0, 0, 0         tag  new TextViewcontext         addViewtag, lp        codepre  pLong titles would force the tag offscreen.p  pI then tried nested LinearLayouts  the main container as a LinearLayout with vertical orientation, that had a top row that was a horizontal LinearLayout containing the title and the tag, and the bottom row being the description.

Negative 18929 pA program I am modifying converts EMF files to a different format SVG.  It does this with EnumEnhMetaFile which calls the programs parsing routine for each record of the EMF.  That works great for the vector stuff.  However, it also needs to be able to pull out a bitmap when it hits an EMRSTRETCHDIBITS.  The final target is actually a base64 encoded PNG, but the sticking point is grabbing the Bitmap.  Does Microsoft provide a function somewhere for pulling out an image at this point  The inverse operation, adding a bitmap to the EMF, is abitmap.Draw, what I need is some sort of abitmap.Read that can operate from within the EnumEnhMetaFile data processing.  p  pIs there a function that converts from the data offset fields that EMRSTRETCHDIBITS provides to a Windows Bitmap  Note, I do not want to render the EMF into a bitmap, I want the original bitmap that is stored in the EMF.p  pThanks.p

Negative 18929 pIve written a simulation in C that generates 1,000,0002 numbers from a specific probability distribution and then does something with them.

All of the distributions Ive done so far took 1015 hours. The Beta distribution is not in the boostrandom package so I had to use the boostmathdistributions package. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4181403generaterandomnumberbasedonbetadistributionusingboostthis page on StackOverflowa which proposed a solution. Here it is copypastedp  precodeinclude ltboostmathdistributions.hppgt  using namespace boostmath   double alpha, beta, randFromUnif   parameters and the random value on 0,1 you drew   betadistributionltgt distalpha, beta  double randFromDist  quantiledist, randFromUnif  codepre  pI replicated it and it worked. The run time estimates of my simulation are linear and accurately predictable. They say that this will run for 25 days. I see two possibilities 1. the method proposed is inferior to the one I was using previously for other distributions 2. the Beta distribution is just much harder to generate random numbers fromp  pBare in mind that I have below minimal understanding of C coding, so the questions Im asking may be silly. I cant wait for a month for this simulation to complete, so is there anything I can do to improve that Perhaps use the initial method that I was using and modify it to work with the boostmathdistributions package I dont even know if thats possible. p  pAnother piece of information that may be useful is that the parameters are the same for all 1,000,0002 of the numbers that I need to generate. Im saying this because the Beta distribution does have a nasty PDF and perhaps the knowledge that the parameters are fixed can somehow be used to simplify the process Just a random guess.p  pAny help much appreciated If you need more details, please ask.p

Negative 18929 pI want to construct a WPF system that can incorporate addin developed by an external developer community.

Negative 18929 pI am new to Android development and Eclipse. I have been given an Android app and asked to make some simple changes to it. I can build the project and run it in the emulator, but I see some errors in the LogCat window in Eclipse.p  pI put aside the app I was given and wrote the Hello World app, following the Hello World tutorial on developer.android.com. With this simple app, I was surprised to see many errors and stack dumps in the LogCat window. I closed Eclipse and relaunched it. After waiting for Eclipse to finish initializing, LogCat was empty. Then I started the Hello World app by clicking the run button. After a while entries appeared in LogCat, including many errors.p  pWith such a simple app, copied from the tutorial, I am guessing the errors arise from the development environment andor virtual device rather than from the app itself, but I would like to be able to run apps without errors.p  pIs it a reasonable expectation to be able to run Android apps from Eclipse on an AVD without any errors Or is it the state of the art that the development environment logs many errors and dumps stack traces even when everything is running normallyp  pIf it is reasonable, I will pursue each error until I have cleaned up my environment and application. I would prefer this, as I would then know that if errors appear as I continue development, they arise from my application and must be fixed. On the other hand, I cant spend months developing Eclipse and the Android SDK. If I have to learn to live with logs full of error messages, Ill just ignore them unless something crashes.p  pNote that the Hello World application runs as expected  it appears to be working despite the errors.p  pI am running Eclipse Indigo SR2 and Android SDK  I dont see a version number for the SDK  the installer is r18 and SDK Manager says there are no updates available on Windows 7 Professional, 64bit.

Negative 18929 pIm building a GUI application framework using WPF in .NET 3.5.p  pMy main application has very few dependencies. One of its jobs is to load external assemblies plugins and request windows and controls from them.p  pThat part works fine.p  pProblems arise when a plugin uses a control not defined in the WPF framework. For example, I have a plugin that references the WPF Toolkit and uses a codeDatePickercode. When the main application reads the XAML file and sees codeDatePickercode, it throws an codeXAMLParseExceptioncode, stating p  blockquote   pCannot find type Microsoft.Windows.Controls.DatePicker. The assembly   used when compiling might be different than that used when loading and   the type is missing.p blockquote  pIts obvious to me why this exception is being thrown, and adding a reference to the WPF Toolkit in the main application fixes the problem. But I wont be able to add references in the main application for every control used by a plugin, because I have no idea what those controls might be.p  pIll also add that the main application loads plugins using codeAssembly.LoadFromcode.p  pstrongNow for the questionsstrongp  pDo I need to have the plugins copy their dependencies to the main applications directory, then load them as well What are my other options Has this issue been addressed somehow in .NET 4p

Negative 18929 pI hope the provocative title caught your attention  Despite the first impression that this may leave, I am really interested in finding out where the differences are, and more generally, to identify canonical use cases where HLists cannot be used or rather, dont yield any benefits over regular lists.p  pIn order to not waste time and effort I am aware that there are 22 I believe codeTupleNcode in Scala, whereas one only needs a single HList, but that is not the kind of conceptual difference I am interested in.p  pIve marked a couple of questions in the text below. It might not actually be necessary to answer them, they are more meant to point out things that are unclear to me, and to guide the discussion in certain directions.p  h3Motivationh3  pIve recently seen a couple of answers on SO where people suggested to use HLists for example, as provided by a hrefhttpsgithub.commilessabinshapelessShapelessa, including an answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11815908validtypecastingofbothcovariantandcontravariantclassatruntimeinscalathis questiona strongNotestrong the answer has unfortunately been deleted by now. It gave rise to a hrefhttpchat.stackoverflow.comrooms14938discussionbetweenmhsandedmondo1984this discussiona, which in turn sparked this question.p  h3Introh3  pIt seems to me, that hlists are only useful when you know the number of elements and their precise types statically. The number is actually not crucial, but it seems unlikely that you ever need to generate a list with elements of varying but statically precisely known types, but that you dont statically know their number. strongQuestion 1strong Could you even write such an example, e.g., in a loop My intuition is that having a statically precise hlist with a statically unknown number of arbitrary elements arbitrary relative to a given class hierarchy just isnt compatible.p  h3HLists vs. Tuplesh3  pIf this is true, i.e, you statically know number and type  strongQuestion 2strong why not just use an ntuple Sure, you can typesafely map and fold over an HList which you can also, but strongnotstrong typesafely, do over a tuple with the help of codeproductIteratorcode, but since number and type of the elements are statically known you could probably just access the tuple elements directly and perform the operations.p  pOn the other hand, if the function codefcode you map over an hlist is so generic that it accepts all elements  strongQuestion 3strong why not use it via codeproductIterator.mapcode Ok, one interesting difference could come from method overloading if we had several overloaded codefcodes, having the stronger type information provided by the hlist in contrast to the productIterator could allow the compiler to choose a more specific codefcode. However, I am not sure if that would actually work in Scala, since methods and functions are not the same.p  h3HLists and user inputh3  pBuilding on the same assumption, namely, that you need to know number and types of the elements statically  strongQuestion 4strong can hlists be used in situations where the elements depend on any kind of user interaction E.g., imagine populating an hlist with elements inside a loop the elements are read from somewhere UI, config file, actor interaction, network until a certain condition holds. What would the type of the hlist be Similar for an interface specification getElements HList[...] that should work with lists of statically unknown length, and that allows component A in a system to get such a list of arbitrary elements from component B.p

Negative 18929 pI have a Firebird DB.  For most of my tables I have a trigger which fires before insert which will create the Primary Key PK for me via a generator as well as write to the newly inserted records a Created Date value and a Created By value.  I also have an update trigger which writes to an Updated Date field and an Updated By field.p  peg Client is a table in my DBp  precodecreate trigger tclientid for client active before insert as begin   new.clientid  genidgenclientid, 1   new.created  currenttimestamp   new.createdby  currentuser   new.lockvn  1 end   create trigger tclientupdate for client active before update as begin   new.updated  currenttimestamp   new.updatedby  currentuser end     codepre  pWhen I apply updates thru my ClientDataSet CDS  which are attached to remote TDataSetProviders via a TDSProviderConnection, how can I retrieve these generated values  If I edit an existing one which will in turn call the tclientupdate trigger, calling RefreshRecord will get the updated and updatedby fields.  However, the Doco says to use that method cautiously, so that may not be the correct way to achieve this.  I call it straight after Ive called ApplyUpdates1.p  pThe CDS I use only contains the one record I am attempting to Edit.  For a New record, the CDS is in dsInsert mode.  Everything is written to the DB ok so I just need to get this new data back out again.  I have also tried using a CDS which contains ALL records in the table too to see if it was any simpler but didnt make any difference  unsurprisingly.  The reason I need this information is simply to show to the user in DB Aware controls these values.  They are read only.p  pI could call a Get on the record I guess when editing an existing record, using the PK, but that wont help for an Insert as I dont know what the new PK is.  p  pExample of where I attempt to ApplyUpdates to my CDS actDSSave is a TDataSetPost actionp  precode  dsState  actDSSave.DataSource.DataSet.State   DoApplyUpdates1   if dsState  dsEdit then     TClientDataSetactDSSave.DataSource.DataSet.RefreshRecord codepre  pI am using TIBQuery for my dataset attached to the remote DataSetProvider.  This query SQL is a simple strongselect  from client where clientid  clientidstrong.  I have tried associating this query with a TIBUpdateSQL too as well as trying to set poAutoRefresh to true in the DataSetProvider.p  pSo is it possible to obtain these Trigger generated values this way or do I need to approach it in a different way Another way I can think of, is to create stored procedures which do CRUD against each table and use that instead with appropriate inout params to return this new data but hopefully I dont have to go down that track. Hopefully I have provided sufficient info here to explain and replicate the issue.  p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong Realised in above, DoApplyUpdates1 is my own method.  Its implementation at the moment is simplyp  precodeFdatCommon.cdsClient.ApplyUpdatesMaxErrorCount codepre  pFdatCommon is a TDataModule containing my CDS.p

Negative 18929 pIs it possible to write portable C code using nested functionsblocksp  pI understand that gcc only supports nested functions as an nonstandard extension, and clang only supports blocks  but is there a way to write code that will compile on both using standard C with MACROSp  pIf it is not possible  what is the best work around  As an example, how would one implement a portable version of the following sort that takes a parameter Trivial example in GCCp  precodeint mainint argc, char[] argv    char reverse  0    int cmpfuncconst void a, const void b        const int aa  const inta     const int bb  const intb     return reverse  aa  bb  bb  aa       int list[8]  1,2,3,4,5,20,100,200   qsortlist, 8, sizeofint, ampcmpfunc  codepre  pA similar example could be put together using Blocks in Clang. Ideally the solution should be threadsafe so avoid global variables.p  pstrongEditstrong For clarity, lets assume standard means C99.  The above is a trivial example.  What Im after is a C99 approach to a sort that requires some parameters.  Here it just uses a char as a boolean, but Im after a solution that would take multiple integers etc. It looks like this might not be possible without global variables.  p  pstrongEdit 2strong I realised that passing a void pointer along with a function pointer enables you to do everything that can be done with nested functions.  Thanks to Quuxplusone for suggesting codeqsortrcode and codeqsortscode. Ive tried to put together a portable wrapper on codeqsortrcode and codeqsortscode.

Negative 18929 h2Ill give you the tldr up fronth2  pIm trying to use the state monad transformer in a hrefhttpsgithub.comscalazscalazScalaz 7a to thread extra state through a parser, and Im having trouble doing anything useful without writing a emlotem of codet m a gt t m bcode versions of codem a gt m bcode methods.p  h2An example parsing problemh2  pSuppose I have a string containing nested parentheses with digits inside themp  precodeval input  617032 codepre  pI also have a stream of fresh variable names characters, in this casep  precodeval names  Streama to z  codepre  pI want to pull a name off the top of the stream and assign it to each parenthetical expression as I parse it, and then map that name to a string representing the contents of the parentheses, with the nested parenthetical expressions if any replaced by their names.p  pTo make this more concrete, heres what Id want the output to look like for the example input abovep  precodeval target  Map   a gt 617,   b gt 0,   c gt 32,   d gt bc,   e gt ad  codepre  pThere may be either a string of digits or arbitrarily many subexpressions at a given level, but these two kinds of content wont be mixed in a single parenthetical expression. p  pTo keep things simple, well assume that the stream of names will never contain either duplicates or digits, and that it will always contain enough names for our input.p  h2Using parser combinators with a bit of mutable stateh2  pThe example above is a slightly simplified version of the parsing problem in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq12442615334519this Stack Overflow questiona. I a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12443270334519answered that questiona with a solution that looked roughly like thisp  precodeimport scala.util.parsing.combinator.  class ParenParsernames Iterator[Char] extends RegexParsers    def paren Parser[List[Char, String]]   gt contents lt        case s, m gt names.next gt s  m       def contents Parser[String, List[Char, String]]       d.r   gt Nil  rep1paren         ps gt ps.map.head.1.mkString gt ps.flatten         def parses String  parseAllparen, s.map.toMap  codepre  pIts not too bad, but Id prefer to avoid the mutable state. p  h2What I wanth2  pHaskells a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackageparsec3.1.3Parseca library makes adding user state to a parser trivially easyp  precodeimport Control.Applicative gt, ltgt, lt import Data.Map fromList import Text.Parsec  paren  do   s, m lt char  gt contents lt char    h  t  lt getState   putState t   return  h, s  m   where     contents         flip , []      ltgt many1 digit      ltgt ps gt map fst . head ps, concat ps      ltgt many1 paren  main  print    runParser fromList ltgt paren [a..z] example 617032 codepre  pThis is a fairly straightforward translation of my Scala parser above, but without mutable state.p  h2What Ive triedh2  pIm trying to get as close to the Parsec solution as I can using Scalazs state monad transformer, so instead of codeParser[A]code Im working with codeStateT[Parser, Stream[Char], A]code. I have a solution that allows me to write the followingp  precodeimport scala.util.parsing.combinator. import scalaz., Scalaz.  object ParenParser extends ExtraStateParsers[Stream[Char]] with RegexParsers    protected implicit def monadInstance  parserMonadthis    def paren ESP[List[Char, String]]       lift  gt contents lt lift.flatMap        case s, m gt get.flatMap         names gt putnames.tail.map gt names.head gt s  m                def contents ESP[String, List[Char, String]]      liftd.r   gt Nil  rep1paren.map       ps gt ps.map.head.1.mkString gt ps.flatten         def parses String, names Stream[Char]      parseAllparen.evalnames, s.map.toMap  codepre  pThis works, and its not that much less concise than either the mutable state version or the Parsec version.p  pBut my codeExtraStateParserscode is ugly as sinI dont want to try your patience more than I already have, so I wont include it here although a hrefhttpsgist.github.com3747234heres a linka, if you really want it. Ive had to write new versions of every codeParsercode and codeParserscode method I use above for my codeExtraStateParserscode and codeESPcode types coderep1code, codegtcode, codeltcode, and codecode, in case youre counting. If I had needed to use other combinators, Id have had to write new state transformerlevel versions of them as well.p  pIs there a cleaner way to do this Id love to see an example of a Scalaz 7s state monad transformer being used to thread state through a parser, but Scalaz 6 or Haskell examples would also be useful and appreciated.p

Negative 18929 pIm developing an android app that has a lot of bitmaps that uses a lot of RAM. My question is that when I keep my app running for a long time and the ram usage exceeds 64 MB, the app crashes with an OUT OF MEMORY ERROR, VM wont let us allocate ... etc.p  pWhile other apps such as facebook reaches 200 MB ram sometimes without any crashes and with a very fast performance.

Negative 18929 pIf a function takes as an input the name of a text file, I can refactor it to instead take a file object I call it stream is there a better word. The advantages are obvious  a function that takes a stream as an argument isp  ul limuch easier to write a unit test for, since I dont need to create a temporary file just for the testli limore flexible, since I can use it in situations where I somehow already have the contents of the file in a variableli ul  pAre there any disadvantages to streams Or should I always refactor a function from a file name argument to a stream argument assuming, of course, the file is textonlyp

Negative 18929 pIm porting Linux to an ARM platform. The platform Im developing for has an OTG chip which I would like to attach a driver to. It doesnt have an OTG driver yet. However, it is based on the EHCI specification so I think it would at least possible to get the host controller working without writing a whole new driver.p  pIve attached the generic EHCI HCD platform driver to the device and it seems to be detected and initialised but no interrupts are coming in when I plug in a device.p  pBefore I spend more hours debugging, I just wanted to ask if it was possible, with some small modifications, to use a generic host controller driver on an OTG device for just USB host supportp  pThanksp

Negative 18929 pIm writing a C console app and having an issue where the primary thread closes before all the spawned off Tasks have a chance to complete. General program flow looks like thisp  pThe program takes the path to a directory as a command line parameter.

For example, I use one file as a control test and know that at there are 450 unique keys in the dictionary so there should be that many corresponding files written out. However, only about 10 files get a chance to write out before the program ends.p  pHow can I ensure that my program stays live long enough for all Tasks to finish Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 18929 pIm following the suggested architectural path put forward in Programming Entity Framework Code First.p  pThere is a DataAccess layer and a Model layer which both form separate projects in VS.  p  pThe Model layer holds my classes for business objects. The DataAccess layer has a reference to the Model project so that it can create a context and DbSets for each of my business objects.p  pThe issue is that some classes in the Model need to access the data layer to perform calculations, however I cannot reference the DataAccess layer in my Model project as it will create a circular reference.  The DataAccess layer must reference the Model layer so that it can create the DbSets.

Based on that lookup list I am able to reduce my queryset.p  pNow the problem is that my database is too large to filter down that way, as the resulting SQL query looks like the followingp  precodeSELECT status.id, status.servicenumber, status.status     FROM status     WHERE status.servicenumber  01xxx  OR status.servicenumber  02xxx  OR status.servicenumber  03xxx ...... codepre  pThe list of ORs is too long and the reduce cannot be done in the database anymore, the error received isp  precodeDjango Version 1.4.4 Exception Type DatabaseError Exception Value    1153, Got a packet bigger than maxallowedpacket bytes codepre  pI increased already maxallowedpacket in MySQL, but this time I dont think it is the right way to simply increase that value again.changedp  pMy SimpleListFilter looks likep  precodeclass TargetFilterSimpleListFilter     parametername  target      def lookupsself, request, modeladmin         return              v1, V1.0,             v2, V2.0,               def querysetself, request, queryset         if self.value             lookup  []             for i in Target.objects.usingexternaldb.filtertargetself.value.valuesservicenumber.distinct                 lookup.appendstri[servicenumber]             qlist  [Qservicenumber f for f in lookup]             queryset  queryset.filterreduceoperator.or, qlist             return queryset codepre  pThe listed code worked for years, but became fast slower and now isnt working at all. Ive tried to use frozensets, but this doesnt seem to work. Do you have an idea on how I can reduce very large setsp  pThanks for any hintp

Negative 18929 pIm curious to why most natives languages, including C,C and D, doesnt define stackoverflow behaviour. Is it because it would require instrumenting every stack variable allocation and function call which, in turn, would make the code unusably slow Evenso, it could at least be enabled only when compiler was fed some extra verbose debugging flag.p  pIm asking this because I feel dubious over use of C99 variable length arrays VLA and C function codeallocacode when writing C code. For some memory handling intensive algorithms this can result in significant speedups.p  pIm guessing this question has been asked many times but I cant seem to find a relevant article on stackexchange.p

Negative 18929 pI am currently designing a spell system and am trying to come up with an elegant way having spells which can target a Creature, an Area or perhaps other things in future. I find this comes up quite often in many situations. The options I can think of arep  ul liPass in a Target object with both a Creature and a Vector3. The derived class will use whichever one it actually needs.li liMultiple Cast functions, one for each target type. This just seems dirty and is my least favorite.li liUsing inheritance, create some target object and pass it into the Cast function. This means I cannot store Spells in a single list in Creature because I would need to include the type when initializing the list.li ul  pHere is the general format I have at the momentp  precodepublic abstract class Spell      public SpellCastStatus Cast               Deduct mana etc          SpellCastStatus status  Cast           protected abstract SpellCastStatus Cast   public class AreaSpell  Spell       private Vector3 targetPosition       protected override SpellCastStatus Cast                return SpellCastStatus.Ok         public class CreatureSpell  Spell       private Creature targetCreature       protected override SpellCastStatus Cast                 return SpellCastStatus.Ok         public class Creature      public ListltSpellgt spells  new ListltSpellgt  codepre  pHow would you go about designing the spell system similar to above to accept different target types Is there a design pattern or something simple I am missingp  pDoes anyone know any good resources that would help give me some confidence with these sort of design problemsp

Negative 18929 pAfter a person has toured my website for N pages, I would like to raise a popup window asking them if they would like to subscribe to my newsletter.p  pIve found sample code to raise a popup after a delay of some seconds, Ive found samples for asking only once, but not one that can track the number of pages traversed.p  pWhere can I find sample JS code to raise a window after a certain number of pages have been traversedp  pMy simple minded analysis is that normally each invocation of the script on N pages would be a different invocation, and hence would not have any record of the previous pages invocation.  So each copy would have to read a cookie set by the previous copy, increment it, and store back.  Then, when N3 and whatever other conditions I think are appropriate are satisified, the popup is triggered.p

Negative 18929 pstrongTLDR How do you add a full text index using Entity framework 5 coded migrationsstrongp  pIm having issues adding a full text index to a database using Entity framework migrations. It needs to be there from the start so Im attempting modifying the InitialCreate migration that was automatically generated to add it. p  pAs there isnt a way to do it via the DbMigrations API Ive resorted to running inline sql at the end of the Up code.p  precodeSqlcreate fulltext catalog AppNameCatalog Sqlcreate fulltext index on Document Data type column Extension key index [PKdbo.Document] on AppNameCatalog codepre  pWhen this runs everything gets created fine until it reaches this sql, then it throws the the sql error emCREATE FULLTEXT CATALOG statement cannot be used inside a user transaction.em. Which is expected and working as designed. p  pThankfully Sql has an overload that allows you to run the sql outside the migration transaction. Awesome I thought.p  precodeSqlcreate fulltext catalog AppNameCatalog, true Sqlcreate fulltext index on Document Data type column Extension key index [PKdbo.Document] on AppNameCatalog, true codepre  pBut low and behold modifying the code to do this see above results in a new timeout error emTimeout expired.

Ive also diffd the generated sql with and without running it outside a transaction and they are identical so it must be something in the way sql is executed.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

However, when i called my Cameradollywhich really should not be called dolly, as i aim to rotate the camera function, i rotated the camera position without rotatingupdating the upDirectionwhich is initialized to 0,1,0 variable.

Negative 18929 pAt the moment Im struggling with how to implement a api from postcode.nl. A Dutch initiative that helps you to get the street and city when a zipcode and housenumber is entered. Because the api is free to use, they dont give any support besides the documentation, which is very limited. Therefore Im trying to find my answer here, so thanks in advancep  pHere the URL of the webpage with the documentation a hrefhttpsapi.postcode.nldocumentationrestjsonendpoint relnofollowhttpsapi.postcode.nldocumentationrestjsonendpointap  pAt the bottom they mention the followingp  blockquote   pWe do not support jsonp. We recommend to host a simple proxy script on   your own server instead of making cross domain calls directly in the   browser. This way, you also do not have to put your key and secret in   publicly readible javascript.p blockquote  pI wont say Im a noob, but I never used REST before I think or did something on my server via a proxy. So does anyone have a clue of how I can implement this api..p

MPIFinalize  codepre  pAs I have 2 nodes NumberNodes2 variable in code, I have one as rank0, and another as rank1NumberNodes1. The rank 0 code goes to the ifrank0 loop where it outputs Testing X 0 but never gets to output Testing Y 0 because it breaks beforehand on the MPISend function. The variable Cookie at this point is 0 as there is only one GPUdevice so the SendRecvID function takes 1,0,0. The first parameter of MPISend is a pointer, as DeviceHaloetc is an array of pointers, whilst the location that the data is sent to is rank11.p  pSimilarly, the rank 1 code goes to the ifrankNumberNodes1 loop where it outputs Testing A 1 but not Testing B 1 as the code stops before completing the MPIRecv call. As far as I can tell the parameters of MPIRecv are correct, as rank10 is correct, the number of data points sent and received is correct, and the ID is the same.p  pWhat I have tried so far is to make sure they each have the exact same tag although the SendRecvID in each case takes 1,0,0 so is the same anyway by hand writing 999 or so, but this made no difference. I have also changed the DeviceHaloetc parameter to ampDeviceHaloetc in both MPI calls, just in case I messed up with pointers there, but also no difference. The only way I could get it to work so far is by changing the DeviceHaloetc parameters in the MPISendRecv call to be some arbitrary arrays on the Host to test if they transfer, doing so allows it to get passed the first MPI call and of course get stuck onto the next, but even that only works when I change the number of variables to SendRecv to 1 instead of it being NumDataPtsfhalo14250. And of course, moving host arrays around is of no interest. p  pRunning the code using the nvcc compiler with additional linking variables I am not too sure on how these work, having copied the method online somewhere, but given that more simple device to device MPI calls have worked I see no problem with this, throughp  blockquote   pnvcc TestingMPI.cu o runTest Iusrlibopenmpiinclude   Iusrlibopenmpiincludeopenmpi Lusrlibopenmpilib lmpicxx lmpi ldlp blockquote  pand compiling withp  blockquote   pmpirun np 2 runTestp blockquote  pDoing so gives me an error that typically looks like thisp  precodeTesting  A 1  Testing X 0 [Anastasia16671]  Process received signal  [Anastasia16671] Signal Segmentation fault 11 [Anastasia16671] Signal code Invalid permissions 2 [Anastasia16671] Failing at address 0x700140000 [Anastasia16671] [ 0] libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.60x364a0 [0x7f20327774a0] [Anastasia16671] [ 1] libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.60x147fe5 [0x7f2032888fe5] [Anastasia16671] [ 2] usrliblibmpi.so.1opalconvertorpack0x14d [0x7f20331303bd] [Anastasia16671] [ 3] usrlibopenmpilibopenmpimcabtlsm.so0x20c8 [0x7f202cad20c8] [Anastasia16671] [ 4] usrlibopenmpilibopenmpimcapmlob1.so0x100f0 [0x7f202d9430f0] [Anastasia16671] [ 5] usrlibopenmpilibopenmpimcapmlob1.so0x772b [0x7f202d93a72b] [Anastasia16671] [ 6] usrliblibmpi.so.1MPISend0x17b [0x7f20330bc57b] [Anastasia16671] [ 7] runTest [0x400ff7] [Anastasia16671] [ 8] libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.6libcstartmain0xed [0x7f203276276d] [Anastasia16671] [ 9] runTest [0x400ce9] [Anastasia16671]  End of error message   mpirun noticed that process rank 0 with PID 16671 on node Anastasia exited on signal 11 Segmentation fault.  codepre  pI am running the code on my laptop Anastasia, a Lenovo Y500 with dual GT650m NVIDIA graphics cards running on Linux Ubuntu 12.04LTS, if that makes a difference. nvcc version gives release 5.0, V0.2.1221, and mpirun version gives mpirun Open MPI 1.5.4.p  pAny help would be immensely appreciated as I have been looking at this for about 5 hours straight without any chance of getting anywhere, and I have very little time to really get stuck into coding without major interruptions baby is very disruptive.p  pI hope there are no mistakes, and thank you for having taken the time to read this.p  pEDIT 6Aug13  11am  Simplified description and code a small bit.p

Negative 18929 pPlease find the workbook a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsiyc9bvh7c1mqlmsCalculating20Rolling20Correlations.xlsx relnofollowhereap  pThe first row contains the names of the banks and all other entries are the daily returns of each bank. What I want to do is find the rolling correlation from the past 1 year of returns of pairwise banks beginning from 112008, Ill provide an example of what I want to dop  pStarting with ERSTE GROUP BANK, on the date JAN 1st 2008, I want to find the correlation between ERSTE GROUP BANK and RAIFFEISEN BANK INTL based on the past 1 year worth of returns, so the formula would be CORRELB2B263,C2C263, similarly on JAN 2nd 2008 the formula would be CORRELB3B264,C3C264 and so on until Feb 28th 2013. p  pThen I want to do the same thing but now on the date JAN 1st 2008, I find the pairwise correlation between ERSTE GROUP BANK and DEXIA, hence the formula on JAN 1st 2008 would be CORRELB2B263,D2D263 and so on until Feb 28th 2013. p  pSo essentially I want to find the pairwise correlations between ERSTE GROUP BANK and every other bank like this, from 1120082822013.p  pThen I want to repeat this with ALL the other banks, eg, now take RAIFFEISEN BANK INTL as the primary bank and from 1120082822013, I want to find the pairwise correlation between RAIFFEISEN BANK INTL and ERSTE GROUP BANK, then RAIFFEISEN BANK INTL and DEXIA etc. p  pDoes anyone have an idea on how to write a macro for this Any help would be appreciated.p  pEDIT This is the code I have currently, which works, but only for one bank, I would like to have the code automatically do it for all other banks too. p

Negative 18929 pIn WP7 codeMediaElementcode allowed me to seek a frame forward or backward when the MediaElement is paused. Unfortunately in WP8 that isnt so. p  pSo I have come to codePlayerframeworkcode by a hrefhttpsplayerframework.codeplex.com relnofollowMicrosofta and hoped it could fulfill my needs.p  pHere the Property codeSeekWhileScrubbingcode convinced me to give it a try. I tested the player, but with codeSeekWhileSrubbingcode enabled it also doesnt work porperly to set the codePositioncode property. For me it looks like the player decides randomly if it updates the frame displayed or not. p  pI have also tried codeLivePositioncode Property and after that the codeSeekToLivecode method but it also doesnt fix my issue.    p  pSo how can I achieve that I can seek while my playback is paused and also preview the current framep

And c1.dll in return calls another C dll c2.dll for some lower functions.p  pstrongDetailsstrong In the implementation of csharp1.dll, there are pinvoke lines such asp  precode[DllImportc1.dll, CallingConvention  CallingConvention.Cdecl, CharSet  CharSet.Ansi] static extern unsafe internal void openhwint id codepre  pHowever, there is no direct reference to c2.dll, c2.dll is loaded by codeLoadLibraryc2.dllcode in c1.dll.p  pstrongProblemstrong When csharp1.dll is added to a C windows console application, it works fine and all functions of c1.dll and c2.dll can be used. When csharp2.dll is added to a C web application, c1.dll is loaded, however c2.dll cannot be loaded.p  pThis problem only happens when used within a C web application, which is being run from the webserver IIS.

Negative 18929 pI have a central repository where I store some binary zip files. A client can download specific files from this repository, unzips them locally and then places the resulting files in a designated folder.p  pAt some point, this changes the encoding of one of the files in the stored zip. I have no explanation for why this happens, but it does. My own files are in UTF8 and contain a character whose code point is represented as C3B3 in a hex editor.

Negative 18929 pI have been using the VBA code from a previous question really useful and very much appreciated to the author who shared it,p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma155894233058684httpstackoverflow.coma155894233058684ap  pand I was wondering how best to modify it so that if there is a gap in a sequence of image names for example, I have a reference to images in cells A4A10 and A13A20, but the code used in this example will put the image for B10 in cell B12, not in B10. It appears to keep the image in a buffer until it finds the next image and then inserts the image into the previous cell. Id like to be able to ensure that the image gets put in the correct cell. I intend to use this quite a bit, and there will be gaps in the cells that contain the image address so the correct placement will be important. I am relatively new to VBA coding so would appreciate any feedback.p  pI have attached an image of what is currently happening. I have a range selected, B1Y4. The images addresses are located in various cells highlighted in red but are moving to the cells highlighted in green. I have placed arrows showing where they are moving from and to. As you approach the end of row 1, the next image drops down to row 2 and moves along until the next image cell address. i want to the images to stay in the red cells and not move. There are no image referenced in the cells between each red cell. The code I am using to do this is as followsp  precodeDim pic As String file path of pic Dim cl As Range iterator  Set rng  RangeB1y4 For Each cl In rng                   pic  cl.Offset0, 0             Set myPicture  ActiveSheet.Pictures.Insertpic             With myPicture                 .ShapeRange.LockAspectRatio  msoTrue                 .Height  115                 .Top  Rowscl.Row.Top                 .Left  Columnscl.Column.Left             End With codepre  pThanks, Gerp

Negative 18929 pIm working on a programm notifyfs which takes care for caching of directory entries and watching the underlying filesystem for changes. The cache is stored in shared memory, gui clients can make use of the cache very easily.p  pCommunication between server notifyfs and clients can go using a socket or via the shared memory self, by sharing a mutex and condition variable.p  pWhen a client wants to load a directory it does the followingp  pa. select a view, which is a data struct in shared memory, which consists of a shared mutex, conditionvariable and a small queue array, to communicate addremovechange events with the client.p  pb. the client populates hisher model with what it already finds in the shared memoryp  pc. send a message to the server with a reference to the view, and an indication to the path it wants to load its contents. This maybe a path, but if possible the parent entry.p  pd. server receives the message does some checks, sets a watch on the directory, and synces the directory. When the directory has not yet been in the cache this means that every entry it detects is stored in the cache. While doing so it signals the view the data in shared memory an entry is added, and it stores this event in the arrayqueue.p  pe. the gui client has a special thread watching this view in shared memory constantly for changes using the pthreadcondwait call. This thread is a special io thread, which can send three signals entry added, entry removed and entry changed. The right parameters it reads from the array queue a reference to the entry, and what the action is. These three signals are connected to three slots in my model, which is based upon a QStandardItemModel.p  pThis works perfectly. Its very fast. When testing it I had a lot of debugging output. After removing these to test it without this extra slow io, it looks like the QTreeView cant catch up the changes. When loading a directory it loads two third of it, and when going to load another directory, this gets less and less.p  pIve connected the different signals from the special thread to the model using QtQueuedConnection.p  pAdding a row at a certain row is done using the insertRowrow, list call, where row is of course the row, and list is a QList of items.p  pIve been looking to this issue for some time now, and saw that all the changes are detected by the special io thread, and that the signals are received by the model. Only the signal to the QTreeView is not received somehow. Ive been thinking, do I have to set the communication between the models signal and the receiving slot of the treeview also to QtQueuedConnection Maybe something elsep

Negative 18929 pI have an IndexedDB which is locally caching data with three properties a,b and c. a and b together form a composite key and c is the content Im after.p  pNow, the client gets from the server a list of items which I want to display. Then the client should look up a,b in the IndexedDB and retrieve the matching c, then hash c using sha1 using Rusha, this already works fine.p  pFor those items, where the sha1cclient does not match sha1cserver, the client retrieves all a,b pairs from the server using one GET request with a JSONserialized array of a,b. The server returns the updated content of c, and then the client stores the new c in the IndexedDB and then gives the whole array of objects to the display function.p  pAs you can see, the most part of the logic absolutely needs sequential operations  but IndexedDB is highly asynchronous.p  pAny way to do what I want in a synchronous wayp

Negative 18929 pI have a program that zips up files in a folder, then sends them via FTP. Im using Rar.exe command line winrar utility to zip the files.  And Im using ncftpput.exe command line ftp sending utility to send the files. p  pThe program was working fine for months, until recently I decided to turn it into a windows service.  I added the service code wrapped on top with the same program underneath. However now I am getting a strange problem. p  pEssentially what happens is that ncftpput.exe andor Rar.exe will appear to freeze midoperation. I cannot kill them in taskmgr since they are under the system account  access denied Rar.exe was using abotu 50 CPU usage and was apparently still zipping a file, however that file had not changed size or been modified for hours.  ncftpput.exe is chugging along, however there is no FTP connection open at all.  Normally both of these programs should keep running until they have completed their task, or else exit if they encounter a problem like most cmd line programsp  pCan anyone guess how changign this program to a service has made this behaviour happenp  pOS Windows XP embedded.p  planguage C  3.5p  pthanksp  pEDIT my intention for using rar.exe and ncftpput.exe was that i   could use a reliable cmd line program that would work properly, and not  have to write more code to include in my program.br evidently i shouldnt be launching these programs from a service, rightbr what is the best way to do it then Thanks for replies. p

Negative 18929 pI am trying to link a number of dynamic libraries into an application and running into problems with g.p  pConsiderp  ul lilibA.soli lilibB.so depends on libA.soli lilibC.so depends on libB.soli liApplication D depends directly on libC.soli ul  pIf I try to link application D just to libC.so, I get unresolved symbols for the symbols in A and B.  I feel as if the compiler should be able to figure it out, and when I use the intel compiler, it does.  G, however, cant figure out the linking.  I would like my libraries and executables to only have to link to the things they directly need, not try to anticipate what the libraries they are using need.p  pI have also had problems when libA.so links to a static library, and when I try to compile the executable I get unresolved symbols from the static library that libA.so was supposed to be using.p  pI have seen a number of other people ask this and similar questions and get a variety of answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11055569linkingwithdynamiclibrarywithdependenciesLinking with dynamic library with dependenciesa, but the answers are all rather vague, often conflicting, and very much along the lines of keep on trucking and RTFM.p  pI get the impression that link order matters.  How so, and how do I know what order to link inp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI believe that what is happening is something along the lines of libA.so contains two functions AA and AB.  libB.so needs AA and libC.so needs AB.  When libB.so gets linked, g gets libA.so, sees that only AA is used, and drops AB.  Then when libC.so is linked in, g sees that libA.so was already linked and doesnt revisit it, resulting in AB being undefined.  I have seen documentation indicating that static libraries work this way, but would the compiler treat dynamic libraries the same way  If so, is there a way to work around itp

Negative 18929 pIm developing a tiny web application with FlaskGunicorn on Heroku. Since Im just prototyping, I have a single web process dyno with a worker thread started by the same process. The web application is just returning a JSON dump of a global object, which is periodically updated by the worker thread monitoring an external web service. The global object is updated every 15 to 60 minutes. My plan was to use an exclusive lock in the worker thread when an update to the global object is needed, and a shared lock in the web threads so multiple requests can be satisfied concurrently. Unfortunately it looks like that Python doesnt have shared locks, only exclusive locks. How can I ensure consistency in the web threads, i.e., how to be sure that the update to the global object is atomic while allowing multiple readonly access to the objectp

Negative 18929 pSo I am trying to avoid using duplicate code. At the moment I have several lists which contain Strings one list is called images and the other videos etc. These lists contain the properties of the content and they are in a linked list because that information was read from a text file. p  pI am trying to go through these lists and create imagevideo objects to place in another object later on. p  pAt the moment I have a method p  precodeprivate void loadContentListltStringgt contentType codepre  pinside of it how do I change the object declarations etc depending on the name of the list that was passed through.

I also understand the the concept of polymorphism I just dont see it viable for the content object to do this job of reading the string etc as the object is created depending the contents of the list.p

Negative 18929 pSadly I cant find much information on what Im attempting to do. Ill try to break it down as briefly as possible.p  pIm working with a legacy database, and believe me, it frustrates me too, but it is what it is so weve got to work within the parameters of that.p  pIve got a database with hundreds of thousands of rows, and a particularly ornery statisticreport that needs to be generated. Originally it was in one big query, but that makes it really frustrating to work with because it doesnt allow for very DRY architecting. I broke the query up into a few views and joined them together ultimately in a final view which worked fine for testingdevelopment, but as Im sure some of the more seniorexperienced folks reading this may have guess already, it was quite slow. The most obvious way to speed it up was to apply the where clause to the inner views that were joined together. This sped the entire thing up by large orders of magnitude.p  pSo, given that, I thought to myselfp  blockquote   pWhy cant I just make a model and define the big nasty unionselect infested SQL that it should use and apply any where clauses on the model to each subselect.p blockquote  pMy thinking was that this would basically create a virtual model I couldnt find anything by that name so Im grasping here that didnt really exist anywhere, but when queried it would return transient objects that have relationships most likely to other more persistent models.p  pTo illustrate, Ill post the bignastysql.

Negative 18929 pSo I have a problem. I have my own CustomMembership class that i use in virtually all of my MVC applications, and this custom class inherits MembershipProvider. p  peach app has its own user database and so the user information is rarely replicated across the individual applications, unless people have accounts in each. At any rate, since deploying them, I realize more and more, that the HttpContext is replicating across these applications over the IIS. I have 2 major problems p  ol liSomeone will sign in as user1, yet the HttpContext is returning a username for user3li liThe User context from one application will be in cache or a session, or whatever, and then show up in another application. Eg. I was about to test an application and it gave me an exception when fetching the user roles because the username it was searching for does not exist in this application, but another, and for some reason is being touting as the current context. li ol  pThis is perplexing, I was wondering if I am missing something or failed to initialize something.

Negative 18929 pI have a C Visual Studio solution with about 15 projects. When I build the solution I want all DLL and EXE files for each project to go to a common folder called Deploy.p  pThe way I was thinking about doing it was, for each projects emPostbuild Event Command Lineem section put the following commandsp  precodeIF NOT EXIST SolutionDirDeploy      If directory does not exist, create it     MKDIR SolutionDirDeploy  ELSE      Delete directory to make sure its clean     RMDIR F S Q SolutionDirDeploy     MKDIR SolutionDirDeploy  Copy executable and required DLLs to Deploy directory COPY Y TargetPath SolutionDirDeploy COPY Y TargetDir.dll SolutionDirDeploy codepre  pThe problem with doing it this way, however, is I have 15 projects and would have put this in each individual projects post build event section and also, every time I add a new project, I would have to remember to do the same for it.p  pI checked the solution file properties and did not see a way to set a solutionwide post build event to copy all the files so I did a few Google searches. p  pOne page said to use a C emMakefileem project. I added this type of project to my solution and clicked on the project properties page and found that there is a section under emConfiguration PropertiesNMakeem with the followingp  ul liBuild Command Line li liRebuild All Command Lineli liClean Command Lineli ul  pUsing the emMakefileem projects Command Line option poses a similar problem to above. Many different commands to copy each of my 15 projects output files such asp  precodeCOPY Y SolutionDirProject1binConfigurationName.exe SolutionDirDeploy COPY Y SolutionDirProject2binConfigurationName.exe SolutionDirDeploy ... COPY Y SolutionDirProject15binConfigurationName.exe SolutionDirDeploy codepre  pThere is another apparent problem with doing it this way. As you can see I took advantage of the SolutionDir and ConfigurationName macros but I had to hardcode each project name. I didnt see any macros like AllProjects, AllProjectDirs, etc.p  pAlso, it appears that command line commands for emMakefileem projects are for building, not postbuild events, so I gave up on this idea altogether.p  pI then tried using a emVisual Studio Installerem project. After adding the project to my solution I rightclicked the project and saw that there was an emAddProject Output...em option. This brought up a dialog allowing me to add one of my other projects emPrimary Outputem. I repeated this for each of my other projects and rebuilt.p  pWhat resulted was an .MSI file in the output folder. I then opened installer project properties and changed the emPackage filesem option to emAs loose uncompressed filesem and rebuilt. The output folder now contained all my projects EXE and DLL filesp  pMost people would be satisfied at this point and move on but I am the kind of person who likes to find the best way to do things. p  pThere was one thing I didnt like about using the installer project option, the fact that, besides copying the files from all my projects, it also created an MSI file which I dont need and I didnt see any option tell it not to create one.p  pCan anyone recommend a anotherbetter way to accomplish my goal of copying all project output files to a single folderp  pThank you.p  pP.S. I was thinking I could just make a batch file to search and copy all the EXE and DLL files to the Deploy folder but I would have to run the batch file outside of the Visual Studio IDE and also hardcode the configuration folder Debug or Deploy.p

Negative 18929 pIm currently working on a multimodule project in Eclipse, which utilizes an apache tomcat server. The project that contains the webinterface requires a folder from another maven project. Currently to get this folder Im using a maven resources plugin to get a copy of the desired folder moved over to the project with the webinterface. Looking at just the project explorer I can see the folder has indeed been copied over from the other project. Also when I manually move the .war file for my overall project directly into Tomcat via terminal the project runs fine. However, when I try to run the project from eclipse, its saying that the it cant find the directory, as while the file got copied into the webapps directory it never got copied into the wtwebapps folder. Has anyone run into a similar issuep

Negative 18929 pIve read every post about launch images and Im still confused about the status bar.  I understand that iPad launch images should exclude the status bar and iPhone launch images should INclude the status bar.  I can see that iPad image sizes have the size of the status bar knocked off, so that is no problem.p  pHowever, I included the status bar on my iPhone launch images, but when the app launches the actual device status bar appears to bleed through as though the status bar on my image as the launch image fades, which looks lousy.p  pMy question is whether it would be acceptable to have the iPhone images be the correct size but to not actually SHOW the status bar in the image i.e., in my case, it would just be plain whitep  pThis would create a better looking launch image in my case but Im unclear on what Apple is wanting here.  Thx.p  pEDITp  pApparently, all launch images are now required to include the status bar, including the iPad.  I suppose this changed with XCode5.  p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuserexperienceconceptualmobilehigLaunchImages.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuserexperienceconceptualmobilehigLaunchImages.htmlap

So if the user enters any text in the email input field thus making it codedirtycode and codevalidcode, the Save button will become enabled. But if the user enters any text into the username input field, the Save button will remain disabled.p  pHow can I get the last two conditions to be seenp  precodeltform nameuserForm ngsubmitsubmitFormuserForm.valid novalidategt   ltlabelgtUsernameltlabelgt   ltinput typetext nameusername ngmodeluser.name requiredgt   ltlabelgtEmailltlabelgt   ltinput typetext nameemail ngmodeluser.email requiredgt   ltbutton typesubmit ngdisableduserForm.email.pristine  userForm.email.invalid  userForm.username.pristine  userForm.username.invalidgtSaveltbuttongt ltformgt codepre  h2UPDATE 1h2  pI ended up adding 2 more conditions. It is almost working perfectly now. p  pWhen the page loads the Save button is disabled by default because both fields are codeprisitinecode. If I delete or add a character to either the username or email field, the Save button will get activated because the field gets codedirtycode. So that works. p  pThe problem starts to happen if I first edit the username. If I create a new valid username and then start editing the email field, I will hit points in the editing process where the email is not valid eme.g.em codeemailcode or codeemailcode or codeemailemail.code and at these points we expect the Save button to become disabled but it does not. Somehow once the username is codevalidcode it ignores the fact that the email is codeinvalidcode.p  pIt does not stop there. If I load the page and just start deleting the preloaded email address char by char and hit all the codeinvalidcode positions, I will see the Save button successfully get disabled at each codeinvalidcode position.

Negative 18929 pI have a scaling problem with my sherlocktabs in my tabletlayout as can be seen in this picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9RZWm.png altenter image description herep  pFor some reason the tabletlayout does not scale properly as it does in the phonelayout.

Negative 18929 pI have never really tried IntelliTrace before, but I am currently having a problem with a bug within one of my applications and I cant really reproduce the bug on my localmachine since it only seems to show up in my QA environment thats hosted on Azure. Another problem is that I am not allowed to halt the QA environment since I have users currently doing some evaluation.. and the last problem is.. that the bug seems to be very random.. So I stumbled upon IntelliTrace.. and I have a few questions.. I have searched the web but I cant really find any clear answers..p  pFirst question Does IntelliTrace record all the requests and responses thats made basically will it log all the values for my objects for all requests that done so its more or less like livedebugging in the end...p  pLast question If it does log all the request code execution and their values within variables and objects and such, is there anyway to sort of filter the IntelliTrace down to a specific time.. as it seems to be now.. all the calls are just listed from top to bottom,, but what if Im actually only interested of the calls that has been made during 20140826 0117  20140826 0127.. is there a way of doing thatp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 18929 pI am trying to write HTML annotation service. So I want to attach an annotation to HTML elements where a user clicked. So far a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1259585getelementatspecifiedpositionjavascriptthis posta helped me find HTML element. However I want to locate the element back in DOM tree.p  pSo if I traverse DOM tree down until I met the element, will be my traverse path uniquely identify the element, so I can restore annotation each time, or browsers can build DOM tree differently and there is a risk of changing browser can bring me in troublep  pAnother option can be look for position of found element innerHTML in BODY.innerHTML. However if I have repeatable elements I cant provide exact mapping. Any other suggestions Please do not advise to add some unique id for every HTML element and then use it. It will bloat HTML and I want to avoid it.p

Negative 18929 pIm trying to fix C async code launching a cancelable operation performed in an external dll written in unmanaged C routine.p  pIs there a way to cancel a Task using a Cancellation Token passed to the Task at creation, if the user delegate calls an external non managed C routine p  pAs far I know, Task cancellation involves cooperation between the user delegate and the code that requested the cancellation. A successful cancellation involves the requesting code calling the CancellationTokenSource.Cancel method, and the user delegate terminating the operation in a timely manner either by simply returning from the delegate when he notices that the a cancellation request has been raised by polling the CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested method or by throwing an OperationCanceledException using CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested method. cf a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd99739628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd99739628vvs.11029.aspxap  pThese two ways involve that the non managed C routine executed by the user delegate cooperates by receiving the CancellationToken as a parameter and by calling at regular intervals its IsCancellationRequested andor ThrowIfCancellationRequested methods.p  pIs that possible to do that from a non managed external C routine p  pIf not, is there a way to force the termination of the task executing the user delegate executing the non managed c routine when the cancellation is requested by the requesting code p  pHere is an example extract of the mixed C  CCli  Unmanaged C code Im trying to fix in order to be able to cancel the operation performed by the user delegate in the C unmanaged code part   p  pFrmDemo.csp  precodepublic class FrmDemo  Form      private CliClass mCliObject     private System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource mCts     private System.Threading.CancellationToken mCt      private void FrmDemoLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               Creating the external CliObject         this.mCliObject  new NSDemo.CliClass         ...

Negative 18929 pThe title is not very informative, so let me explain.p  pIm trying to formalize what it means to be a term in firstorder logic. Here is the textbook definition of terms of an arbitrary language codeLcode p  precode1 Each variable or constant is a term.  2 If n  1, f is an nary function of L, and t1 ... tn are terms of L, then f t1 ... tn is a term of L. codepre  pI have already defined variables, constants, functions, and languages as codevarcode, codeconstcode, codefunccode, and codelangcode. I also have functions codefaritycode and codeLfuncscode that returns the arity of a function and the ensemble of all functions in a language, respectively. So giving an inductive definition of terms should be pretty straightforward p  precodeInductive term  L  lang   Type   tv  var gt term L  tc  const gt term L  tf  forall  f  func      l  list  term L  ,   length l  farity f    gt In func  Lfuncs L  f    gt term L. codepre  pBut it doesnt work. Instead, I get this error message.p  precodeError Non strictly positive occurrence of term in  forall f  func l  list term L,   length l  farity f gt In func Lfuncs L f gt term L. codepre  pI have a vague idea of whats going on here. The constructor codetfcode has an argument codelength l  faritycode, which Coq doesnt like because it has codeterm Lcode on the left side of an arrow. But I think Coq is being overly cautious here, because it lets me do pretty much the same thing if I tweak the types a bit. I could, for instance, define a custom list type codelistNcode indexed by its size, so that codelist X ncode would be a list of codeXcode with codencode elements. Then I would havep  precodeInductive term  L  lang   Type   tv  var gt term L  tc  const gt term L  tf  forall  f  func      l  listN  term L   farity f  ,   In func  Lfuncs L  f gt term L . codepre  pBut I dont want to go this way, because it is adhoc, and makes all the useful list libraries unusable. So Im looking for a way to convince Coq that what Im trying to do is perfectly safe, so it will accept codelength l  farity fcode as a constructor argument. Is there a way to do thisp

Thanks.p  pstrongEditstrong This is not part of a SELECT statement. I have six columns and one unique id for each row. What I want, is that each row only have one of its columns set to 1, at a time. If a row has already one column set to 1, then you cant set another of its columns to 1. Also, if one column is already set to one in one row, then the same column cant be set to 1 in another row. So I guess that I want it to be mutually exclusive, both vertically and horizontally, hence why both WHEN statements are the same, the first one so that all previous rows that had a 1 in that column will be reseted to 0, before assigning the 1 to the specific chosen column by id. I placed a WHERE inside the CASE statement because I thought you could do that, judging by the comments, I guess not.p  pThats the full query, I am using prepared statements, and before that, I had thisp  precodeq  congtqueryUPDATE table SET f0 WHERE f1 q  congtprepareUPDATE table SET f1 WHERE id  id qgtexecutearrayid gt id codepre  pIm really a beginner with MySQL, so maybe my solution is laughable, and Im sorry for that.

Negative 18929 pSo, this is the exact opposite of the more common question how to prevent text from spilling over.p  pI am looking for a possible way to make text spill over into the next div automatically.p  pMy site afurnishedsoul.eu is designed for horizontal scrolling, mainly because it contains mostly picture galleries.p  pI also have texts that I would like to present in this layout. If you want to picture it, imagine the divs containing the text arranged like a long row of pages from a book.p  pI would like the divs to behave in the following wayp  pThey load the text maybe, if necessary, from an external text file and distribute it across several the needed number of divs.p  pFrom one pagediv to the next, the text distributes evenly across the layout. All pages start at the same height and end with the same lowest line, i.e. the layout is even and maintained.p  pText spills over automatically from one div to the next  if you are familiar with InDesign, I want the text to behave like its on a path. The amount of text displayed in one div is flexiblevariable, i.e. if text size is set to large in one browser, the text will distribute different from a browser with a small setting. The layout of the page overall always stays the same, but the text divides up across it automatically according to those parametres.p  pI know this is a tricky one, if there is a solution at all. Id be all the more glad if somebody could help me out. The solution can be CSS or HTML preferably, but also other if necessary. Thank you all who read this, Jeff.p

Negative 18929 pIm working in a microservice architecture, which has its own oauth2 provider in order to allow services interaction. p  pI need to develop a service that is granted to access users resources in order to perform internal tasks on user accounts. Since the service needing to access user resource is an internal one its not a viable solution to ask the user to allow access to their own resources.p  pIm concerned about the choice of picking the right grant to perform this tasks, as the codeclientcredentialscode seems the right one, it also seems to be used to only allow to only update service data, instead of accessing user resources. Another solution I thought is to automatically provide the authorization code at users signup, as if the user has clicked an allow button, and then perform requests with that codecodecode grant. The downside here is that I have to create new authorization codes each time a service with that needs is created, but it seems to be a more clear solution as auth code for user XXX only allows to access resources of user XXX.p  pI also understand that implementations are different as the standard gives a lot of flexibility, but  Which one, in your opinion, is the appropriate solution How would you handle it Would it be more clear to say, statistic service is allowed to access all users resources or statistic service is granted by all users to access their resourcesp

Negative 18929 pSo this question is kind of interesting, I think. And before I lose anyones attention or they start shoving their fingers into my face with accusations no I am not making or attempting to make a virus. I actually had a really good idea for a game. This game will be kind of like a creepy pastaa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCreepypasta relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCreepypastaa, in that it will mimic the ideals of a haunted game. This game, when launched, will play for only a few seconds before ultimately crashing back to the desktop. It is at this time that I would like to hide all traces of its existencewhich is still running in the background so that I may continue with phase 2 of the game. During this phase, I will randomly take control of a console window, or play creepy sound effects at arbitraryrandom intervals. The game will open back up at random, as if it has a mind of its own, too, but the game will be different each time this happens.p  pI would like to hide the game from the task manager completely. So this windowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh3oiq.png altenter image description herep  pWill show absolutely nothing of the program, no matter the tab the user selects. I want the game to, quite literally, turn into a ghost. The programming language that I am planning on using is C and for the graphics library, OpenTKWhich is irrelevant for this question, but I want to make sure I lay down as much information as possible.p  pAnyone have any ideas Oh, and I should also mention that I am quite fluent in the .NET frameworkapi, and I can build any windows forms application by handwithout using the editor.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI just thought of a fun alternative to hiding it. The answer make the program smarter. Send the program to desktop, then listen for the opening of a task manager. If it opens, my program immediately shuts down task manager and the game responds with something super creepy like But i thought you wanted to play with me Why are you trying to kill me in a console. Sounds awesome. Lol.p

Negative 18929 pI have an Access 2010 tool that I created that links to some SharePoint lists. This solution was working fine until my end users decided they needed more PeopleGroup fields which put us over the view threshold for lookups. I do not have access to central administration so this is a hard stop. So I decided that I could link to three views and join the data with a query and all should be good. To be able to link to a SharePoint list view you have to use DoCmd.TransferSharePointList instead of using the External Data option. External Data links to the entire table thus the threshold prevents data from being returned. p  pI need to link to three views so my code isp  precode Function SPVLink  DoCmd.TransferSharePointList acLinkSharePointList, httpserversitessitename, 94E4E5D377C84170BBA23F9533C24627, CF2A3189B45B4527A4F3CF323C9E7E21, IssueTracker0, True DoCmd.TransferSharePointList acLinkSharePointList, httpserversitessitename, 94E4E5D377C84170BBA23F9533C24627, C6C7ABBAC159400F8402F6B56954BA5C, IssueTracker1, True DoCmd.TransferSharePointList acLinkSharePointList, httpserversitessitename, 94E4E5D377C84170BBA23F9533C24627, 290947AD8BC4461082C1E636CFBBF06C, IssueTracker2, False   End Function codepre  pThis runs without error however the linked views are not created.

Negative 18929 pWe are currently using AWS ELB  Apache in front of our Tomcat instance running Grails. We use Apache to redirect http requests to https requests. This works fine for us on our regular site. The issue arrives when trying to embed our site within an iframe on Chrome. Chrome does not like an https site redirecting to an http page even if that page subsequently redirects to https. The reason this happens is that to Spring Security it looks like were on http because were behind a load balancer. Here is the network ping pong from Developer Toolsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlnHi4.jpg altenter image description herep  pHere is the problem when putting that same page within an iframe on Chrome.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0vCRY.jpg altenter image description herep  pWe have found many solutions that will allow the Spring Security Grails plugin to redirect http requests to https request for certain URL patterns.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23664835forcegrailsweblogictoonlyredirectusinghttpsprotocolHerea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20572667grailsspringsecurityredirecttologinpageusinghttpsherea are two of these examples. We have already solved this issue by having Apache intercepting http requests and redirecting to https.p  pThe issue is that Chrome wont even make the http request within the iframe. We need an ability to tell Spring Security that even though the a hrefhttpdocs.spring.ioautorepodocsspringsecurity3.2.5.RELEASEapidocsorgspringframeworksecuritywebsavedrequestSavedRequest.html relnofollowsaved requesta you receive is using http, we need you to change that to https once you complete the authentication.p  pOne solution we thought may work was changing to a relative URL using contextRelative instead of the absolute URL, which Spring Security views as http because of the ELB proxy. This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26526830howtomakespringsecurityapplicationtorunbehindaproxyposta seemed to suggest the same, but the solution also did not change the URL generated when changing contextRelative to true.p  pHow can we tell the Grails Spring Security plugin to always either format the URLs as relative or force them to an https scheme so that we can run the application within an iframe in Chromep

Negative 18929 pIm trying to replace a WCF service based on BizTalk and as far as I know it was made using the BizTalk wizard for publishing WCF services. In order to resolve the problem I did something tricky, I exposed an ashx handler and read the soap. We want the department that consumes the service to not make any change except the url .svc .ashx and maybe another minor change like change binding. The problem I have now is the message for some reason uses more than one soap request with security tokens likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaRYoF.png altenter image description herep  pI suppose is related to the service model configuration credentials i think in the WCF client, p  pIs there any way to force the binding in order to send just only one no encryptedrequestp

Negative 18929 pI have a long .XML file 60K or so lines that Im working with. I need bash to start the script and have a user input a name to be removed from the .XML file.

I think it is important to say that there is only 1 instance of strongcorruptstrong in the .XML file. Also, for other strongcorruptfilesstrong, there are no spaces in the file names, only underscores or dashs.p  pSo codesedcode would need to remove the entire xml block containing strongcorruptstrong information, leaving no empty lines where it removed text, then the script would overwrite the current media.xml file.p  pI hope this question isnt confusing.p

Negative 18929 pIve encountered a few cases in KDE software where a dynamiccast of something thats a KPart fails on OS X. Im not that much of a C expert, so I wouldnt even know where to begin to debug such a situation. Ive seen this happen with ktimetracker, and the latest and better discussed case is with Okular a hrefhttpsbugs.kde.orgshowbug.cgiid345765 relnofollowhttpsbugs.kde.orgshowbug.cgiid345765ap  pIn a nutshell the codeOkularPartcode class inherits the codeOkularViewInterfacecode class as the last parent in a list. Yet when the code retrieves an codeOkularPartcode instance codepartcode, codedynamiccastltOkularViewInterfacegtpartcode returns NULL.p  pThe last comment in the BKO ticket above is that using a static cast would be a poor mans fix in this case, but that I should try to figure out why the dynamiccast fails. Which leads me to 2 questionsp  ul liwhat does a dynamiccast do in addition to a traditional cast hereli lihow would I figure out why it fails This would be an issue with the runtime, libc, noli ul

Negative 18929 pMy use case is a realtime Spring MVC application that deals with a small amount of noncritical data which churns rapidly. The data consists of around 20 keyvalue String pairs. It is pulled in on schedule from an external API, can be modified by an end user interacting with the webapp, and is used to produce parameters in a POST to another external API on a schedule.p  pThis may be very obvious, perhaps too obvious to have a answer I can find anywhere, but basically why would I keep the data in a DB as opposed to using a dedicated singleton class with threadsafe fields such as a ConcurrentHashMap, which would then be injected into any Services that need it My initial feeling is that a class such as this would allow quicker readwrites than even an inmemory DB, yet every example I have seen relies on a proper DBp  precodeRepository public class DataStore    private Map data  new ConcurrentHashMapltString, Stringgt    ...getters and setters etc..  codepre  pThanks for any thoughtsp

This despite having the digest properly appended.p  pIm not certain, but it may only be those assets that are included by other assets that get the nocache header.p  pThe ones that dont have nocache are correctly getting public, maxage31536000.p  pIs there an extra step I need to take for included assets to make them use the right CacheControl directive  Im not a Rails expert nor am I the person who set up this particular server.  Just trying to debug the issue after the fact.p  pEDITED TO ADDp  pIt turns out the JS files that are being handled correctly i.e. public, maxage31536000 are the ones explicitly listed in assetsjavascriptsapplication.js.

Negative 18929 h2Edith2  pI thought this was a bug, it is actually default behavior as described completely buried more like in the Qt documentation... When the active subwindow is maximized, the default behavior is to maximize the next subwindow that is activatedp  hr  h2Questionh2  pWhen there are multiple codeQMdiSubWindowcodes in a codeQMdiAreacode and some are flagged to Stay on Top they interact strangely with Maximised windows. That is, when a window is maximised and there are still other sub windows rendered over it, weird behavior occurs.p  pWhen any of the Stay on Top windows are clicked on or interacted with, they maximise and the maximised window is restored.p  pSo far I cant seem to work out how the state of one window could be tracked by another, the source code is a mess and the private class model they are using is confusing as hell and makes interacting with the implementation basically impossible to do nicely.

Negative 18929 pUnder some conditions, when my app starts, it displays an AlertDialog.  However, the alert never gets displayed.  I discovered that if I add a delay, it works i.e. gets displayed.p  pMore specifically on app startup, it executes the main activity onCreate which under a certain condition starts a 2nd activity.  In the 2nd activity, through a separate thread, it makes a check for some web server status.  If the Android device doesnt have Internet connectivity, HttpURLConnection returns an error instantly and my enclosing function executes a callback to the 2nd activity.  My code then uses post to attempt to display an alert to the user using post allows displaying the alert on the UI thread, which is required.p  pApparently it tries to display the alert before any of the either activitys UI has been created.  If I use postDelayed in the 2nd activity, the problem still persists.  However, if I use the following block of code in the main activity, the alert shows properlyp  precodenew Handler.postDelayed new Runnable     Override public void run        Intent intent  new Intent app, MyClass.class     app.startActivityForResult intent, requestCode    , 3000 codepre  pMy solution is a hack that happens to work at the moment.

Negative 18929 pI have users who manually copy text from a div element on our web application and paste it directly into a third party fat client. When the div contents are copied from IE, the text is stored in the Windows clipboard as Rich Text Format in addition to other formats.

Incidentally, Chrome does not store copied text as Rich Text, but rather as HTML Format which does not get used by the third party software, so our issue seems to be isolated to IE.p  pI discovered that text copied from input fields does not get stored as Rich Text, but using text inputs for this content is not ideal stylistically. p  pI havent found a way to disable rich text from being copied out of a styled element.

Negative 18929 pIm currently using Slick 3.x.x which is completely asynchronous in all its calls to the database. Lets say, I have a table that has some sort of versioning. Every time I create a new entry from an already existing entry i.e. updating a given entry, I have to make sure that I increment the version number. p  pHow can I make sure in this asynchronous world of database communications that I can maintain data integrity In my case with versioning, I would first do a select for the max version which would give me back a Future and then I use the result of this Future, increment 1 and issue a create command p  pIt could very well be possible that thread 1 started with select max version and paused for a while, thread 2 catering to a new request could run the select for max version and increment and write the new record in the database. Now thread1 comes back and tries to so the same process, but only to result in the fact that thread1 would overwrite what thread2 wrote in the database. p  pIt could be that I might end up having multiple duplicates because the order in which multiple futures might be run might differ p

Negative 18929 pIm using Node.JS with Express and Handlebars. I was having trouble just updating a particular div as well as sending data.p  pIll ask the question from the 10 level first because maybe the details are unnecessary to answer.

Negative 18929 pI have a large window with a number of codeNSTextFieldcode fields on it, and I would like to intercept the space bar even while any of the text fields have focus, so that pressing space at any time will cause a separate action.p  pSubclassing codeNSTextFieldcode and overriding codekeyUpcode allows me to detect the space key, but a blank is still inserted in the text field. codekeyDowncode does not fire at all.p  pFor other keys like Return and the arrow keys, I could use the codecontroltextViewdoCommandBySelectorcode delegate method, but it does not fire with the space bar.p  pTheres a lot of advice out there for codeNSTextViewcode, but I have found none for codeNSTextFieldcode.p
Negative 18929 pBasically Im wondering what the proper way to present and release view controllers is.p  pMy original understanding was that ViewControllerA presents ViewControllerB with presentViewController Animated Completion. Then ViewControllerB can release himself by calling dismissViewControllerAnimated Completion.p  pNow, if I have three view controllers, A, B and C. A presents B, B presents C, and C returns to to A, how should I write this I tried to call a dismiss from C on B, but that doesnt work. The only thing that actually seems to work is having C present A again, but is this properp  pAny help would be great, thanksp
Negative 18929 pHas anyone encountered the issue of the pull down fresh animation getting stuck on the third color Im not getting a minimum of 3 circles O, I get 2.5 with the final one being resembling the letter C.The first two colors perform a 360, and the last color gets stuck at 180 sit there for a few seconds then goes away and the datascreen refreshes. When I comment out refreshListView the circle loops infinitely.

Negative 18929 pI have a column full of textstring values.  Some of the values appear to be null, but in reality have some formatting additional spaces left over from the exporting program where I get the excel data. I am trying to create an array using all capitalized letter of the English alphabet to cypher through each cell in the column, looking for the instance of any of the alphabets letters within the first letter of each cell in the specific column, and if not found, returning a completely blank value in the neighboring column. If a letter value is found, then it would return the entire value of the cell.  This way I can have true blanks and will be able to sort things a bit better. p  pI have been trying to find a working argument to build off of but aside from thep  precodeLEFTCell,1AZ codepre  pI have found little that seems to be a viable workaround.  Any help is appreciated Thanksp
Negative 18929 pSo in excel, you can assign cells names to avoid using Row and Column numbers. In this case, this is especially useful because Im dealing with several excel sheets and do not know where this particular cell will be.p  pHow can I get the value of this cell Im currently looping through the entire worksheet looking for it, but I stumbled across this online, which would speed up my application considerably.p  pIf found posts online that suggest either codexlWorkSheet.CellsCellName.Valuecode or codexlWorkSheet.GetCellCellName.Valuecode. Unfortunately the cells method does not accept a string as an argument and the GetCell method does not exist. Im using the interop library. Thank you in advance.p

In that case, I get a blank response with customErrorsOn and the detailed YSOD if customErrrorsOff. If I remove my filter, then I get the nodetails YSOD which is also pointless. Either way, ApplicationError in Global.asax.cs does not get fired. Moreover, all my other custom filters and global exception handling works without any issues regardless of where the exception is thrown from.p  pHow can I handle codeRequestValidationExceptioncode in a userfriendly manner regardless of where the exception originates from regardless of whether or not it is thrown from within an codeAreacodep  pUpdate even doing a codefilterContext.Result  new RedirectResultcode results in the same blank page and stepping through it indicates all is well, but no proper response.p

Negative 18929 pIm working on an OpenGL app where the screen image is often static. I can think of 3 ways to handle this situationp  ol liSimply keep rendering the entire screen over and over anywaysli liAsk OpenGL to call the render loop only when there are changesli liOnly redraw the image when it changed and exit from render loop immediately otherwiseli ol  pClearly option 1 would be a gigantic waste of processing power i.e. battery charge on mobile devices and option 2 would be the optimal solution.p  pThe power consumption difference between option 2 and option 3 is probably very minimal though correct me if Im wrong, since the unnecessary call to the renderloop and any associated setupoverhead should be tiny. It turns out that for my multithreaded rendering pipeline option 3 would be a LOT easier to implement than option 2. So, I would like to give that a shot first if I can make it work.p  pWhen I tried it by rendering a static image once, the screen started flickering between that image and black like crazy. My guess is that this is due to double or triple buffering My image only gets drawn into one of the buffers, but on every call to the renderloop, the buffers are flipped, so that the image ends up on the screen only when that one buffer happens to be the active one.p  pSimple solution Draw the static image once into every buffer and only then start exiting the renderloop immediately.p  pFor this I need to know the number of buffers, i.e. the number of times I need to draw the image. Is there a way to query this number Or can I somehow prevent the buffer switch if my renderloop turns into a NOOPp  pI am building an OpenGL ES 1.0 and an OpenGL ES 2.0 version of this code for maximal device support.p

Negative 18929 pIve tried to solve the problem below for a coding challenge but could not finish it in 1 hour. I have an idea on how the algorithm works but Im not quite sure how to best implement it. I have my code and problem below.p  precodeThe first 12 digits of pi are 314159265358.  We can make these digits into an expression evaluating to 27182 first 5 digits of e as follows  3141  5  9  26  5  3  5  8  27182 or 3  1  415  92  65358  27182  Notice that the order of the input digits is not changed. Operators ,,, or  are simply inserted to create the expression.  Write a function to take a list of numbers and a target, and return all the ways that those numbers can be formed into expressions evaluating to the target  For example f314159265358, 27182 should print  3  1  415  92  65358  27182 3  1  4  159  26535  8  27182 3  1  4  159  26535  8  27182 3  14  15  9  26535  8  27182 3141  5  9  26  5  3  5  8  27182 codepre  pThis problem is difficult since you can have any combination of numbers and you dont consider one number at a time. I wasnt sure how to do the combinations and recursion for that step. Notice that parentheses are not provided in the solution, however order of operations is preserved.p  pMy goal is to start off with sayp  precode3 then 31, 31, 31, 31 31 then 314, 314, 314, 314, 314, 314, 314 etc. codepre  pthen look at the every value in the list each time and see if it is target value.
