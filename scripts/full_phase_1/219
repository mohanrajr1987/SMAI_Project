Positive 219 pIve reversed the following algorithm from a challenge binary Im investigatingp  precodedef encryptplain     l  lenplain     a  10     cipher        for i in range0, l         if i  a lt l  1             cipher  chr xorplain[i], plain[ia]          else             cipher  chr xorplain[i], plain[a]           if ordplain[i]  2  0 a  1  even         else a  1  odd      return cipher  from binascii import hexlify print hexlifyencryptthis is a test string codepre  pEssentially, it XORs each character with another character in the string, offset by codeacode. codeacode initial value is code10code, as the function iterates over the characters in the string, codea 1code if  the characters value is even or codea  1code if its odd.p  pIve worked out in my head how to reverse this cipher and retrieve plain text, it would require the use of a recursive function to find out which character offsets are evenodd in the original string. IE Given the properties of XOR  2, we now that if codecipher[0]code is odd then either codeplain[0]code or codeplain[10]code is odd, but not both. Similarly if codecipher[0]code is even then both codeplain[0]code and codeplain[10]code are even, or both are odd. From there a recursive algorithm should be able to work the rest.p  pOnce we know which characters in plaintext are evenodd, reversing the rest is trivial. Ive spent a few hours working this out, but now Im at loss implementing it.p  pIve used basic recursive algorithms in the past but never anything that branches out to solve something like this.p  pGiven a codeciphercode string resulting from this function, how could we suse a recursive algorithm tos determine the parity of each character in the original plain stringp  pstrongEDITstrong Sorry just to be clear and in response to a comment, after scratching my head on this for a few hours I thought the recursion strategy outlined above would be the only way to solve this. If not Im open to any hintsassistance to solving the title question.p

Positive 219 pI have a set of public APIs that take in an id and some parameters.  Clients could be browsers or mobile phones, each having their own codeintcode ids, can interact with these public APIs.  Of course, we dont want a situation where client changes his id and send a request screwing things up for other people thus, when authentication takes place, a codeGUIDcode is sent to the client as an authentication token.  All subsequent request must include that authentication token.  On the server, the back end does a look up in the DB to match the codeGUIDcode with the id.  If they match, the process can go forward otherwise UnauthorizedAccessException is thrown.  All works fine and dandy.p  pBut of course, the problem is that every operation does a db look up.  I did some caching but then caching the authentication token has its own issues tears tears.  p  pOne other way to do it is to encrypt something and pass it in the query string.  But then when the request comes in, I have decrypt the string to see if its valid.  There is no free lunch there.p  pasp.net sets an encrypted cookie for authentication.  But the view state encrypts things in the hidden field.

But, it turns out our web app sometimes needs to make web service calls to a thirdparty.  Turns out this third party hasnt updated their own crypto policy, and we need to use a sha1 key exchange with them.  p  pIn a cool twist, we learned that configuring IIS with the above tool also impacts key exchange when we act as a client, calling the third party  so our calls out to the web service fail because we cannot negotiate a key exchange.p  pIs there a way that I can programmatically configure the acceptable key exchange when I go to make an http request preferably locally, so that I am only applying the policy to my outbound connection, not to inbound connections hitting our web server p

Positive 219 pSo I have a kind of interesting issue. I have a field in my data store which must take exactly 160 bits of information. Some users will choose to make this data encrypted, some wont, so some of those 160 bit fields will be ciphertext some will be plaintext. A boolean will indicate which one the user is using. The important thing here is that I need this field to be exactly 160 bits long. However, a 128bit cipher will mean I have to put in 256 bits in as plaintext, which is fine, just use a buffer string, but this means that the output is 256 bits when what is stored must be exactly 160 bits. And I cant simply cut off the ciphertext or that would mess up the decryption. So how can I use a 128bit block cipher like AES note it MUST be a 128 bit block cipher, I cant change that to encrypt 160 bits into 160 bits such that it can be decrypted back into the original 128 bits.p  pstrongJust a note The field in the database must stay exactly 160 bits. No this can not change. The size of the blocks can not change either its going to be a 128bit cipher no matter what.

Positive 219 pI am working on a SpringMVC application in which I am planning to use Jasypt so we can encrypt some sensitive textfields. These fields are entered by user manually, and the reason to choose Jasypt was because it works transparently with Hibernate, which we are using. p  pNow, the situation is that there is already data in those textfields which is plain. If I were to use the annotation and mark the field as to be encrypted, then the already existing data in the textfield will be useless as Jasypt will try to decrypt it and fail or give some garbled data. p  pIs there a way in Jasypt in which I can manually encrypt the data and then save it, because I have code to retrieve all the textfield and I can easily iterate through them and encrypt them as necessary. If yes, can anyone point me to how I can do it. p  pCurrently I only have the annotation added in my code in this fashion p  precodeEntity Tablename  groupnotes public class GroupNotes       Id     Columnname  mnoteid     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator  mnotegen     SequenceGeneratorname  mnotegen, sequenceName  mnoteseq     private int mnoticesid    Columnname  mnotetext     TypetypeencryptedString     private String mnotetext      Columnname  mnoteheadline     TypetypeencryptedString     private String mnotetag codepre

Negative 219 pAs far as I know theres no way to hint the c compiler to inline a particular function and I guess its like that by design.p  pI also think that not letting the programmer to specify what to inline and what not is generally a good idea, as it would imply that you think youre smarter than the JIT compiler my respects to those who actually are, but, what if I wanted to specify that a critical portion of code needs to be extremely fast at any cost, no matter how to achieve it on the target machine As of yet you cant do such a thing and I wonder if both the c language and the JIT will ever support this feature.p  pIn my case, I know what the target machine is, and I know that function inlining will help improve the performance. This leaves me thinking that the only way to enforce function inlining is getting to know under what circumstances the JIT will do it but I dont think thats a good idea either,p  pAny light on the subject would be much appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 219 pReading some questions here on SO about conversion operators and constructors got me thinking about the interaction between them, namely when there is an ambiguous call.

If you removecomment out the codeoperator Bcode code from codeAcode, the compiler will happily switch over to using the constructor instead with no other changes to the code. p  pMy questions arep  ol liSince the compiler doesnt consider codeB b  Acode to be an ambiguous call, there must be some type of precedence at work here. Where exactly is this precedence established a referencequote from the C standard would be appreciatedli liFrom an objectoriented philosophical standpoint, is this the way the code should behave Who knows more about how an codeAcode object should become a codeBcode object, codeAcode or codeBcode According to C, the answer is codeAcode  is there anything in objectoriented practice that suggests this should be the case To me personally, it would make sense either way, so Im interested to know how the choice was made.li ol  pThanks in advancep

Negative 219 pFrom what I know of MVC outside of the Java world PHP and Ruby on Rails, all requests are first sent to the front controller or dispatcher... or boostrap, etc., and the front controller looks to the request path pattern in the URL in order to determine what classmethod should handle the request. In Java MVC, it appears that servlets are mapped with the url pattern in the deployment descriptor web.xml, but the file extension and url pattern doesnt appear to be very flexible. Are there any Java MVC frameworks that use a front controller to read the request path exclusively to determine what classes should execute Would it be fairly easy to hack Spring MVC to do this Any examples Thanksp

Negative 219 pWeve got a bunch of data the users may want to view windows of and do so quickly. They may want to look at a window of the data that is a day, a week, a month, or an arbitrary beginning and ending data. Sorting and summing up all of this stuff in real time is proving to be painful for us so I got the idea of doing something similar to Mipmaps in 3D rendering. You end up storing the same data precalculated at a variety of different scales and then interpolate the results using the varying scales. So I would already know what the numbers were for a year, a given month, a given week, and a given day for a store and if they ask for a particular range I use the various scales to quickly add up something that gives the right results but I dont have to necessarily reprocess the full data set, I just retrieve four or five records and add or subtract them.p  pIs this a real pattern Does it make any sense and there are places I can read about how to do it best or are there much better ways of dealing with large chunks of data like this where it needs to be viewed in varying slicesp  pIt seems like this should be a well known and solved problem. For example, lots of people have stock portfolios and they need to do this kind of thing every day. Our data isnt stock prices, but the idea is the same.p

Negative 219 pIve created a new Google App Engine project within Eclipse. I copied several JARs that I need for my application into the WEBINFlib directory, and add them to the build path. I make some random calls to these JARs from within the handler, deploy, and everything works fine.p  pHowever, if I then change one of the JARs outside the project, and copy the new version to WEBINFlib with the same name and redeploy, it doesnt seem to be sending the new JAR everything is still linking to the old one even though its not even in my WEBINFlib anymore. Im guessing its being cached by the server or Eclipse is not even realizing something has changed in order to upload the new version.p  pIf I just create a new project with the new JAR, everything is fine again until I have to make another change... but of course I dont want to have to create a new project for every change to a dependency I make.p  pMy question is, how can I make GAE reupload all the JARs I have from within Eclipsep  pThanks in advance, guys  Adrianp

Negative 219 pIn the last month, weve had a persistent problem with the Python 2.6.x multiprocessing package when weve tried to use it to share a queue among several different linux computers.  Ive posed this question directly to Jesse Noller as well since we havent yet found anything that elucidates the issue on StackOverflow, Python docs, source code or elsewhere online.p  pOur team of engineers hasnt been able to solve this one, and weve posed the question to quite a few people in python user groups to no avail. I was hoping someone could shed some insight, since I feel like were doing something incorrect but are too close to the problem to see it for what it is. p  pHeres the symptomp  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File vardjangorootdevcombrightscopedataprocessesdaemonsdeferredupdatesserversqueueserver.py, line 65, in getfromqueue     return queue, queue.getblockFalse   File ltstringgt, line 2, in get   File usrlocallibpython2.6multiprocessingmanagers.py, line 725, in callmethod     conn.sendself.id, methodname, args, kwds IOError [Errno 32] Broken pipe codepre  pIm showing where our code calls queue.get on a shared queue object, hosted by a manager that extends SyncManger.p  pWhats peculiar about the issue is that if we connect to this shared queue on a single machine lets call this codemachine Acode, even from lots of concurrent processes, we never seem to run into an issue. Its only when we connect to the queue again, using a class that extends multiprocessing SyncManager and currently adds no additional functionality from other machines lets call these codemachines B and Ccode and run a high volume of items into and out of the queue at the same time that we experience a problem.p  pIt is as though pythons multiprocessing package handles local connections even though they are still using the same manager.connect connection method in a manner that works from codemachine Acode but when remote connections are made simultaneously from at least one of codemachines B or Ccode we get a Broken pipe error.p  pIn all the reading my team has done, we thought the problem was related to locking.  We thought maybe we shouldnt use codeQueue.Queuecode, but instead codemultiprocessing.Queuecode, but we switched and the problem persisted we also noticed that SyncManagers own shared Queue is an instance of Queue.Queue.  p  pWe are pulling our hair out about how to even debug the issue, since its hard to reproduce but does happen fairly frequently many times per day if we are inserting and .geting lots of items from the queue.  p  pThe method we created codegetfromqueuecode attempts to retry acquiring the item from a queue 10 times with randomized sleep intervals, but it seems like if it fails once, it will fail all ten times which lead me to believe that .register and .connecting to a manager perhaps doesnt give another socket connection to the server, but I couldnt confirm this either by reading the docs or looking at the Python internal source code.p  pCan anyone provide any insight into where we might look or how we might track whats actually happening p  pHow can we start a new connection in the event of a broken pipe using codemultiprocessing.BaseManagercode or codemultiprocessing.SyncManagercode p  pHow can we prevent the broken pipe in the first placep

For the purpose of the View, the value of the average votes is a Relationship. I noticed that nodes with no votes are displayed after nodes with a negative average.

There is a table strongMeetsstrong that has a column strongLeaderIdstrong, which is a foreign key to the table strongMembersstrongp  pThis is how I have the entity classes set upp  pstrongMeet.csstrongp  precode[TableName  dbo.Meets] public class Meet      private EntityRefltMembergt leader      [ColumnIsPrimaryKey  true, IsDbGenerated  true]     public int MeetId  get set       [Column]     public string Location  get set       [Column]     public DateTime Date  get set       [AssociationName  FKMeetsMembers, Storage  leader]     public Member Leader              get  return leader.Entity          set  leader.Entity  value        codepre  pstrongMember.csstrongp  precode[TableName  dbo.Members]     public class Member              private EntitySetltMeetgt meets          [ColumnIsPrimaryKey  true, IsDbGenerated  true]         public int MemberId  get set           [Column]         public string Name  get set           [Column]         public string Hometown  get set           [Column]         public string Info  get set           [Column]         public ComitteeRole ComitteeRole  get set           [AssociationName  FKMeetsMembers, Storage  meets]         public ICollectionltMeetgt Meets                      get  return meets              set  meets.Assignvalue                codepre  pSelects work on the Meets table and likewise on the Members table and associated entities are loaded fine. However when I try and do an insert into the Meets table I am getting the good old emObject reference not set to an instance of an objectem error.p  pNow the problem must lie with what I am using to store the the strongLeaderIdstrong when I am adding a new Meet entity. I am setting the foreign key in my object like sop  precodeMeet meet  new Meet  meet.Leader.MemberId  1 codepre  pHowever, when I am doing the LINQ insert it doesnt seem to understand that the MemberId of the Leader property is the value to put in the foreign key column in the strongMeetsstrong table.p  pI realise this could probably be solved by adding a separate property to the strongMeetstrong class like sop  precode[Column] public int LeaderId  get set  codepre  pHowever, I dont want to clutter my class with an extra property that is a duplicate of the MemberId property of the Leader property.p  pHope you understand me...

Negative 219 pGoogle Chrome has a handy feature where I can click a download link and drag it into a Windows Explorer window, and then drop.  After dropping, Chrome then downloads the file and it appears where I dropped it.p  pI would like to be able to drop from Google Chrome into my application, but it seems it isnt so simple.  I have a DataGridView called gridFiles, and the following codep  precodePrivate Sub gridFilesDragDropByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs Handles gridFiles.DragDrop     If e.Data.GetDataPresentDataFormats.FileDrop Then         Dim DroppedFiles As String  e.Data.GetDataDataFormats.FileDrop         If Not DroppedFiles Is Nothing Then             For Each file As String In DroppedFiles                 MsgBoxfile             Next         End If     End If End Sub  Private Sub gridFilesDragEnterByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs Handles gridFiles.DragEnter     If e.Data.GetDataPresentDataFormats.FileDrop Then         e.Effect  DragDropEffects.All     End If  End Sub codepre  pWhen I drop files onto it from Windows Explorer, all works fine and I get a message box for each file that was dropped.  However, when I drop from Chrome, nothing happens.  The reason for this is that codeDroppedFilescode is equal to codeNothingcode.  It seems that codee.Data.GetDatacode isnt returning anything.  I have checked the formats with codee.Data.GetFormatscode and it returns codeFileDropcode, codeFileNamecode, codeFileNameWcode as expected with any file drop.p  pWhat I am quite sure is happening is that Chrome says it has some files so that the codeDragEntercode functions, but since it hasnt downloaded the file yet, codeDragDropcode cannot be done, so Chrome returns no files.  I suspect that in a Windows Explorer context, Chrome somehow gets that windows path and copies the file there itself later.p  h2So my question is...h2  pHow can I fool Google Chrome into dropping into my application  I see this working by somehow giving Chrome a temporary folder where it thinks it has dropped the file, and my application would monitor that folder for new files and pull them in once they are downloaded.  I just need to find a way for Chrome to know that folder.p  pAlternatively, if I could get the URL of what was dropped, that would be just fine as well.  I could then download the file with my program.p  pAny and all advice is much appreciated.

Negative 219 pThis is the paragraph on OpenID security from a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpenIDSecurityandphishing relnofollowWikipediaa. Are there any new updates about this, or any comments p  blockquote   pSecurity and phishingp      pSome observers have suggested that   OpenID has security weaknesses and may   prove vulnerable to phishing   attacks.[26][27][28] For example, a   malicious relying party may forward   the enduser to a bogus identity   provider authentication page asking   that enduser to input their   credentials. On completion of this,   the malicious party who in this case   also control the bogus authentication   page could then have access to the   endusers account with the identity   provider, and as such then use that   endusers OpenID to log into other   services.p      pIn an attempt to combat possible   phishing attacks some OpenID providers   mandate that the enduser needs to be   authenticated with them prior to an   attempt to authenticate with the   relying party.[29] This relies on the   enduser knowing the policy of the   identity provider. In December 2008,   the OpenID Foundation approved version   1.0 of the Provider Authentication Policy Extension PAPE, which   enables Relying Parties to request   that OpenID Providers employ specified   authentication policies when   authenticating users and for OpenID   Providers to inform the Relying   Parties which policies were actually   used.[30] Regardless, this issue   remains a significant additional   vector for maninthemiddle phishing   attacks.p      pOther security issues identified with   OpenID involve lack of privacy and   failure to address the trust   problem.[31]p blockquote

Negative 219 pIs there an ACL abstraction layer available in .net I have seen some best practices documents but no good base implementation. What about the  System.Security.AccessControl Is this a good starting pointp  pThe ACLs should work with Roles stored in DB as well as Roles by the system and for inmemoryobject definitions as well as db objects or files. So it should be generic andor easy to extend.p  pShould this rely on IPrincipal, IIdentity from the .net frameworkp  pZend has something similar in their Framework for PHP and I am searching this kind of stuff for C instead of porting that if there is already a standard solution or best practice implementation.p  pladislavp  pIt is not intended to be used only in web services, fat clients or standalone apps. Because of this I am searching an abstraction layer that can be extended by adapters for a specfic backendplatform. Youre right, that I am searching something like a role based access management abstraction layer for different kind of objects and right definitions. This should not rely onto the ACLs you set for folders in filesystems. A filesystem should be a special adapter used by the ACLs implementation. For me, ACL itself is a concept and has nothing to do with filesystems. Filesystems USES an implementation of the concept of ACL even if its mostly known in this field. The hard dependency onto Win32api is not wanted. This is why I am asking for something generic and abstract interface that is commonly and widely used. Do you know the implementation in the zend framework I know it is PHP but the concept works for any app, not only web based It is abstracted and could be used for any object in the codep

Negative 219 pI hope I got all that in this question title. Let me explain. We are starting on small desktop app that will snowball into a big app with many forms. The database is SQL Server. It will have classic stored procsfunctions performing classic CRUD functions.

Negative 219 pAs we are in the beginning phases of rejuvenating our application in to SOA design I have some questions that I can not get a clear answerpicture on.p  pI have been doing a lot of reading, mostly around books from Thomas Erl and following that design pattern of understanding what Task Services, Entity Services and Utility Services are.p  pWhat I am stumbling on is the whole DAL concept of how that would look.  So this is more of a verification of understanding or a clarification so as to help make the best approach for our platform.p  pSo background.  We currently have several web based ecommerce applications that have been pretty much been built in silos and are again pretty much a copy of each other.  We have supporting applications such as Daemons and misc web services out there.  Many of these applications are older then 5 years and are build on only technology Model 1.  All of our applications are centered around conducting auction sales.  So during a sale event we will be taking bids from users, determine who is winning and display that information back.  Each sale event has a set amount of time that they will be available to the users.p  pThe company is moving towards a SOA solution as a lot of things we end up doing can be shared across not only our group but across other groups. p  pSo what I understand on the DAL is that it in itself is a service which will sit on top of Data, in this case different Databases  MSSQL, ORACLE, MSSQL.  Each of these databases have different schemas Oracle etc.  p  pSo the services Task, Entity, Utility and Presentation Tier if needed will make calls to the DAL to retrieve data.  It is the responsibility of the DAL to know, from the contents of the message to determine what it needs to do in order to fulfill the request.p  pSo for example, we have a Security Service candidate.  This service needs to authenticate with LDAP and to authorize from the data that is stored for that given application.p  pThe thought here is that a Utility service will be created to wrap up all the operations required to communicate with LDAP and that the Security Service will call upon the Utility Service and to the DAL to fetch the authorization data.  The DAL then has the responsibility to go to the correct databaseschema to retrieve the information.  The information will be in XML format standard SOA communication.p  pSo, am I on the right track here  Have others done similar things or not  What other things do I need to consider Currently getting the statistics on how many bids we take in an hour  on average.p  pShould each service have its own DAL  for example should the Security Service have the DAL as part of the service or should DAL be a shared service in which all services can usep

Negative 219 pHi I have an application that once it recieves a sms, it has to start collecting the location of the user every 1 minute. Everything starts ok i.e. if I send a text, then the sms processing wakes up and calls the location service to start collecting the location every 1 minute. But after some 30 minutes or so, my application crashes because of memory. I used heap in DDMS and observed the memory which keeps on increasing as time goes i.e. the size of the data object keeps getting higher. I also used the allocation tracker to see if there is any leak in my code and observed all the objects are that being created in my code are getting cleared. I am not sure where I am leaking. Please help me understand is this a memory leak If yes, how can I find where the memory leak is IF this is not a memory leak, how can I make the application run infinitely until I stop it.p

Those COM objects has to be using only in STA memory model and dont have proxystub marshalers that can be used to call them from other thread.p  pAn applications COM objects get initialized during the first test on the thread that was used by the first test.

Negative 219 pI am in doubt with using objects from multiple threads.p  pFirst of all it is no problem to protect the object against simultaneous access with codestdlockguardcode or others.p  pThe next step is to declare the objects with volatile.p  precodeclass A     public int val   volatile A a codepre  pBut doing this ends up in having a lot of new functions with type qualifiers codevolatilecode     ...     int GetVal volatile     void SetVal volatile     ...p  pOK, all this works fine.p  pBut how to access stl members, e.g. codestdvectorcode or codestdmap.codep  pIf I want to have a volatile codestdvectorltintgtcode I run in lots of errors while stl do not define any volatile method.p  pFrom this point I searched the net and found a lot of tricks. Mostly with the same idea in the background Having a mutex for concurrency protection and moving the codevolatilecode away with a codeconstcastcode to make the standard interface available.p  pAs a sample of this implementationsp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class PseudoPtr      public         PseudoPtrvolatile Tamp obj, mutexamp mtx               guardmtx,                pObjconstcastltTgtampobj                       PseudoPtr               Pointer behaviour         Tamp operator     return pObj              T operatorgt    return  pObj           private         myguardltmutexgt guard         T pObj         PseudoPtrconst PseudoPtramp  delete         PseudoPtramp operatorPseudoPtr amp  delete  codepre  pHaving my example class from above without the codevolatilecode qualifiersp  precode class A        ...      int GetVal   codepre  pBut if I use this in the following wayp  precode volatile A a  mutex mu   ...  for          PseudoPtr ptra, mu starts locking the object      if ptrgtGetVal                ... do something ...         codepre  pI will never see any changes in the object a, because the compiler could optimize the access away, because the volatile object was codeconstcastcode and so the optimizer did not know anything about the volatile behavior.p  pFor all my own classes this is not a problem, while I could write all the codevolatilecode methods. But if I want to use a stl container, there is no way to have volatile instances from them and using it though a codeconstcastcode.p  pOK, the actual compiler is not so hard optimizing gcc 4.6.1, but is there a guarantee that the compiler never do this optimization codeconstcastcode will break the codevolatilecode and do not codeconstcastcode on codevolatilecode stl objects will not work, while stl containers have no volatile methods at all.p  pAs I emthinkem, all the tricks found in the web are buggy, because they all ignore the optimizer.p  pThis runs in my questionsp  ul liI am wrong with my interpretation of volatile and optimizersli liIs there a standard working solution for using stl conatiners thread safeli ul  p after a few hours of reading p  pFirst of all, yes, pthreadmutexlock should do the following things  makes access to memory atomic that is the only thing I know before  guarantee that memory becomes visible to all other threadsp  pOK, the second was new to me And this results in the next question How the trick worksp  pThe library which provides the mutex semantic must have a chance to tell  the compiler, to stop out of order execution  writes down all cached register optimized variables to hardware  tell the hardware to synchronize all hardware caches etc.p  pOK, fine But how that works Implementation specific to gcc There exists a macro called barrier which is something likep  pasm volatile  memoryp  pThe pthread library for gcc is included to glibcnptl and each function which guarantee the visibility of data to other threads simply calls the barrier macro or call the inline assembler directly or do the things with something similar.p  pIf there is no misunderstanding again, thats the simple thing behind the curtain.p  pWhat I have learned volatile in combination with mutex locking is not sense full in any case.p  pI write that answer in hope that others run in that mystery becomes also a bit less addled.p  pIf there are again mistakes and misunderstandings Let me knowp  pThanks for all your answersp  pSorry for editing my post to add my own conclusion, but I could not add an own answer to my post p

Negative 219 pIm wondering how people typically do error handling with backbone.js.  It would be nice for something to popup everytime I call model.save which in turn calls Backbone.sync.  The thing is, how does backbone.js know when an error or a success has occurred on the server  I understand it would know if there was a 500 server error or something like that which jquery knows about since Backbone.sync calls jQuery.ajax  but I want to be able to pass messages and other codes so I can give more meaningful error messages to the user.p  pI have one idea and would love some feedback.  The idea is to override Backbone.sync.  The new sync gets a response from the server, which must be in a particular format.  This format would be something likep  precodeServerResponseObject   gt ResponseCode   gt Message   gt Model codepre  pNothing fancy, but basically, instead of just returning the plain model, it is wrapped up with a codeResponseCodecode and codeMessagecode which can be shown to the user.p  pIs this the normal way to do it  Any other approach that is betterp  pThanksp

Negative 219 pIm a bit of an EventMachine novice, so theres a chance Im approaching this completely wrong. What Im trying to do is create an EM connection actually a Blather stream, but that is an EMConnection once when the app starts up, which I can then hit whenever I need to. Right now, the only way I can Blather to work correctly in this Sinatra app is to create a new connection every time, which is wrapped inside a EM.run block.p  pIve been trying to determine if asyncsinatra would help. I dont actually care, though, if the requests happen asynchronously. I suppose it would be nice, but Im still not seeing how I would persist the connection between requests.p  pThe solution that seems to make the most sense in my brain is to setup the connection in an EM block inside the Sinatra configure block, but then Im not sure how to get access to it down the road. Perhaps Im missing something kind of basic, though.p  pp.s. This will eventually run on Heroku, so while I would greatly appreciate any insight, solutions that are known to work on Heroku will be the most useful.p  pEditp  pThis seems to be doing what I want, locally at leastp  precodeclass Dashboard lt SinatraBase   configure do     Thread.start do       EM.run do         xmppstream  BlatherClient.setupjid, password         xmppstream.connect       end     end   end end codepre

Negative 219 pIn one of our apps, we have to implement an online  offline feature. The caching is already done. What we have to do, however, is to implement a save way to prevent the app from opening a network connection.

If not, it returns an http error.p  pMy question is Are there any open source proxies out there, that can handle this feature or do I have to implement the proxy all by myselfp  pBest regards, Michaelp

Negative 219 pI couldnt find an exact answer to my problem in any other posts.  I have parent and child objects Sender and SenderConfig, resp..  The child has a composite primary key, consisting of the parent object and another arbitrary object, modeled per business rules.  I want to be able to get all SenderConfigs for a Sender, thus I added a Set reference to SenderConfigs in the Sender object, and annotated it with OneToMany see below.  I have created a row in the SENDER table and a corresponding row in the SENDERCONFIG table manually.

Negative 219 pI am part of an Agile scrum team working on a software product release. The sprint duration is 2 weeks 10 days.p  pThere is a peculiar metric used here, called strongmidsprint acceptancestrong. Essentially, the expectation is that half the userstory points committed and planned by a scrum team in a sprint needs to be completed by the middle of that sprint. This, they say, results in a linear burndown of points which is a strong indicator that the sprint is going on well.p  pAs a team, our midsprint acceptances are usually bad, but we are known to complete all the committed userstory points by the end of the sprint.p  pI have the following questionsp  p1 Is midsprint acceptance a valid AgileSCRUM practice Is it being used anywhere elsep  p2 Expecting half of the work to be completed in half the time is akin to treating it as a factoryfloor job, where the nature and complexity of the work at hand is completely deterministic. Since software development is a creative process, such rigid metrics in a highly flexible methodology such as Agile is irrelevant. What do you thinkp  p3 Although my scrum team completes all our commitments just in time for the sprint, we are being questioned for our bad midsprint acceptance metrics. Is it completely normal in scrum teams everywhere else to meet their commitments only towards the end of their sprintsp  pMuch thanks in advance.p

Is there a way to put in some logic that if its only this specific page that it would hide the footer and then show on every other pagep  pThanks for any tipssuggestions.p  pEdit There was already a Page Load sub in the code behind. All I had to add was  codeMasterPageFooter.Visible  Falsecode on the If statement when users were not logged in and set it to codeTruecode when they were logged in. Works like a charm. Thanks for all the suggestions.p

Negative 219 pI have made a DLL which contains a managed C class that wraps some of the functionality of a C library. I have a C test project which references the managed C DLL.  Unmanaged debugging is turned on in the C project, and I have set Debugger TypeMixed in the C DLL project.  Heres a sort of diagram of what Ive gotp  pemC console app  wrapper DLL  managed C class  unmanaged C methods implemented in wrapper DLL  C static libemp  pI have breakpoints set in both the managed wrapper class, and in the unmanaged methods in the DLL.  When I start debugging, all of my breakpoints remain solid red.  The breakpoints in the managed wrapper class are hit, but the ones in the unmanaged methods are not.  Strangely, when I try to step into any of the unmanaged methods, the debugger skips over the unmanaged C methods and goes straight into functions in the C static lib.  At that point, the call stack shows [External Code] where I would expect it to show my unmanaged C method.p  pAny ideas about what might be happening herep

Negative 219 pThis seems like it should be easy, but I cant quite find an explanation that fits what Im looking for.  Does anyone know of a way to access a database in the background of a form, and update controls on the form  For example, my visual C application is loading some text boxes and labels from a MYSQL web server database.  When someone updates the website database, Id like for the changes to be automatically reflected in the C application.  Ive tried using a timer, but the form locks up when the timer goes off and retrieves the data.  The backgroundworker control looks promising, but I cant seem to get it to run more than once, and havent had much luck at all even getting it to do what I want.  Is the backgroundworker the way to go in my case  If so, can it be set so that it constantly hits the database like every 30 seconds or so  Any recommendations would be appreciatedp  pThanks,p

Negative 219 pI need to fix a problem with a missing primary key, and I would like to get some ideas  on the best way to do it.p  pWe have a program on several production databases where we insert new data every  hour into a sum table. Five of columns are the key and the other columns are  values which is different sums. We use ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE to add to the  sums at every insert. The insert statement looks something like thisp  precodeINSERT INTO sums key1,key2,key3,key4,key5,sum1,sum2 VALUES ..., 13, 42, 3 ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE sum1VALUESsum1sum1,sum2VALUESsum2sum2 codepre  pThe thing is when the table was created the primary key was not set not my fault . Now I need to aggregate the rows that has the same keys and then add the  primary key. Due to the missing primary key the table has grown to around  700 000 000 rows on a few systems, so I need some efficient way to do this.p  pI would like to do it without having to postpone the adding of new lines every hour. Because in the way the system works now saving the inserts and doing them later will require a lot of work. p  pEvery single operation I do cant lock the table for more that 45 minutes or so. I hope that creating the actual primary key will take shorter than that if I manage to merge some rows first. Maybe it is faster to create an index for a few of the keys columns first so I have an index to use for aggregating rows operationsp  pI am not sure what the best way to aggregate the rows are either. Any good  suggestions would be appreciated.p

If the name is followed by left and right parentheses possibly with commaseparated expressions between them, the object is invokedcalled after it is dereferenced.

Negative 219 pI encountered some unauthorized strangeness working with Scalas SortedMap[A,B].

Negative 219 pIm building code.libcode strongstatic librarystrong for a large project and Id like to hide some function to end user of the library, but I need those functions to be callable from every code.ccode file inside the library thus not static.p  pThis is exactly opposite to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma70944431149736codedeclspecdllexportcodea and Ive already found a solution for a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgwikiVisibility relnofollowgcca. p  pId like to use codestaticcode, but static function a hrefhttpwww.lix.polytechnique.frlibertipubliccomputingprogcCSYNTAXstatic.htm relnofollowshould bea available only inside current code.ccode file, so this is not the way.p  pstrongIn another wordsstrong I need a way how can I tell Microsoft Visual C 2010 not to export some functions to final code.libcode while keeping them available for all other code.ccode files inside the project.p  pemNote Ive never used codedeclspeccode neither codeattribute visibilitycode in my whole solution, this is probably just some default setting associated with building static library which I cannot trace.emp
Negative 219 pIm been an iphone developer for a couple of years and trying to learn mac os x programming. p  pThe app is very simple. The flow is like the Finder app. A NSTableView on the left, and a body view to the right, which will load in different view controllers after the cell have been selected in the tableView. p  pSo I have a main view, and in it, two NSView.p  pIm trying to figure out how to load the different viewcontroller in the right view after a cell has been selected in the left view. p  pIve created AppController.h class that controlls the mainview. p  pMy first thought was to make the AppController a singleton and have the left view call a method in that class. Something like this p  precode voidchangeViewControllerInRightViewintwhichView  codepre  pBut since Im building the app in interface builder, and put the AppController as a NSObject, Im not quite sure how to work it out with the singleton. p  pWhat is the flow to do this p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 219 pI am wondering what would be some suggestions for project  module organization given the following situationp  ol liI have a project codeDomainObjectscode in which I have a class codeMyObjectcode ol liIn codesrctestjavacode of codeDomainObjectscode I have the tests for codeMyObjectcodeli olli liI have a project codeClientcode that depends on codeDomainObjectscodeli ol  pI would like to add a codeParameterSuppliercode called codeMyObjectTestSuppliercode class to provide test instances of codeMyObjectcode for use by tests in codeClientcode. p  pIt seems to make the most sense to provide codeMyObjectTestSuppliercode in the codeDomainObjectscode project. Here is my dilema...p  ol liif I put the supplier in codesrctestjavacode of codeDomainObjectscode it will not be available to codeClientcode.li liI dont want to put it in codesrcmainjavacode of codeDomainObjectscode because that means that JUnit would have to be included as a compile dependancy of codeDomainObjectscode and thereby be included in my production code.li liif I put the supplier in some project codeDomainObjectsTestcode I have three options ol liput just the supplier is the test project but this means that tests in codeDomainObjectscode could not use this supplier.li liput all the tests and suppliers for codeDomainObjectscode in codeDomainObjectsTestcode but that means that codeDomainObjectscode will be successfully compiled by maven even if tests failli licopy the supplier in both codesrctestjavacode of codeDomainObjectscode and codesrcmainjavacode of codeDomainObjectsTestcode.li olli ol  pI thought about trying to make codeDomainObjectsTestcode a module of codeDomainObjectscode but that only works if the packaging for codeDomainObjectscode is codepomcode which does not work here.p  pThoughts Suggestionsp  pEDIT As an explanation, codeMyObjectcode is a simple bean just getters and setters and I use the codeParameterSuppiercode pattern for providing populated instances of beans. The supplier provides utility methods to easily create populated instances of the bean for use in testing. I do this so that I dont repeat this population code or the mocking equivilent throughout my projects.p

Negative 219 pWhen you plug in an LTE modem, as part of the attach process to the LTE network, it sets up a default EPS bearer to carry signalling traffic.  This default bearer is an IP connection with a Traffic Flow Template suitable for signalling traffic.  The specification also allows, that the network can change the TFT of the default EPS bearer so that it can carry data TS 24.301 6.4.1.1, last sentence.p  pSo, if the network does set up the default EPS bearer to carry data and does not create a dedicated EPS bearer, my tests show that Windows wont allow you to browse on the internet until you have set up a connection in the traditional way, eg called the Mobile Broadband API Connect function in Win 7.p  pHere is the question what does Windows still have to do to allow internet browsing, given that an IP connection with suitable quality of service is already openp  pMany thanks in advance for help.p

Negative 219 pI have 2 tables in my Java database. I would like to load rows from table1 and put them in table2. How can it be done please Im using codeResultSet res  stmt.executeQuerySQLcode for reading from table I. What can I use to put this data to table II. p
Negative 219 pI have a a dict that contains an itemID as a key and then a bunch of pairs like thisp  precode91311703, [3300, 2, 3301, 3, 3327, 3, 3330, 2, 3386, 2, 3392, 2, 3 402, 3, 3413, 3, 3426, 3, 3449, 3] codepre  pThe first number in each pair is a unique ID number and the second number is a value from 15.  I want to write this to a table using sqlite3 so that, in this example, there would be one row with an itemID of 91311703 and then a value of 2 in the 3300 column, 3 in the 3301 column, 3 in the 3327 column, etc.p  pThe twist is that the table would have columns for every possible ID number, around 200300 in total.  If the dict I pass it does not contain an ID number I want it to put a 0 for that column, so in this example columns 33023326, 3328, 3329, 33313385, etc. would all get a value of 0.p  pOne possibility Ive thought of is to create this table with a default value of 0 for each column and then when I pass in the dict it would only update the values for ID number columns that it contains.  This seems like a poorly coded way of doing this, though, so Im open to suggestions.  Another option is some sort of codeifcode and codeelsecode that says if ID number is found in the dict then use the value in its pair else use 0, but that also doesnt seem like a really good way of doing this.p  pWhat Python  sqlite3 code do I need to look through this dict and assign values to the columns that match the ID number in the pairs in this dict  What would you suggest for assigning 0 to those columns where the ID number is not found in the dict  My goal is to have one row per itemID i.e. 1 row per key in my dict.p

Negative 219 pI am having problems with modifying a function in spree. The function is called copypricep  pThe original version is something like thisp  precodedef copyprice   if variant     self.price  variant.price if price.nil     self.currency  variant.currency if currency.nil   end end codepre  pwhich if I understand right will update the lineitems unit price only if the price is null, which I believe it shouldnt be inside the orders page after the order is completed.  I noticed that order changes if the master price is changed inside the admin section even after the order is complete. p  pSo i thought that the copyprice function was to blame, but each time i try to modify it there is no change. E.g.p  precodedef copyprice   pricerun  true    self.price  30.00 end  def getpricerun   if pricerun  true     return true   else     return false   end end codepre  pand call getpricerun inside my view to print out if the price run was actually run. and It keeps outputting false. Does anyone know why that would be.p

It was more complicated than I expected, so I pulled the PHP file from an HTML file, which is linked belowp  pa hrefhttpwww.freshmarketonline.comcouponcouponnew.html relnofollowhttpwww.freshmarketonline.comcouponcouponnew.htmlap  pSo, this HTML file pulls the PHP file. I was also able to copy and paste the conversion codes into this HTML file without a problem. The tags work perfectly, except one thingp  pWhen customers print out the coupon, it automatically prints two pages, one coupon and one blank page. Is there anyway to make this coupon only print out one pagep  pThank you.p

Negative 219 pIm doing MD5 hashing on an executable.  Ive used a python script to read binary from the executable into a text file, but if I were to read in this constructed file to a C program, I would be handling MBs of data, as the ones and zeroes are being treated as codecharcodes, taking 8 bits for each 1 bit number.  Would it be possible to read these in as single bits each  How badly would a program perform if I made, say, a 10MB array to hold all the characters I might need for the length of the binary conversion and padding for the hash  If this is unthinkable, would there be a better way to manipulate the datap

Negative 219 pCan someone point me to the preferred method for generating a report or document ID I have been looking at maybe using a guid that would be reduced down to a shorter length.

But I cant seem to find a way to make the hash code come out to a length of 8 characters since people have to use them to refer to the documents.

Information for this tables is retrieved from the server by using codejava.lang.Threadcode and after retrieving information next threads for insertion into database start.codeAsyncTaskcode is slow for this and the problem that one thread can get access to database when other still inserting data.But I dont want to lock database just for one thread and make other threads to wait in this case it takes a lot of time.pSo the question can i in some way allow different threads to insert the data into different tables simultaneouslyp

Negative 219 pOkay, Its been a little while since Ive really had to utilize a lot of threads dynamically.p  pBasically the situation isp  pI have a large collection from a database query, say excessively, 1 million rows have been returned and stored in a collection of some sort arraylist, map, etc.  I wanted to be able to take that collection and divide it up between threads, processes, etc. so the work can get done efficiently.  however I dont want to evenly divide the whole collection into different processes.  I want say 10 threads that work on say 30 rows each and when theyre done processing what they have they grab more rows from the original collection.p  pThis is the first thing that came to mind to solve this problem.  Im not sure how that dynamic allocation of the collection to the threads would look like.  I will eventually want to collect all the individual processes results and compile them into another collection that will be for future processing.  I know the query results will be a very large number of rows and thought that dynamically assigning portions to threads initially and as they finish their tasks would be the best way to handle this.p  pThis is a two part question.  One, what would ...say... the pseudo code look like for this and Two, is this the best way to handle this situationp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Oh and Im thinking of working in C for this.p  pThanksp

Negative 219 pIm trying to perform statistical analysis on relatively flat time series data with AWS Elastic MapReduce. AWS gives you the option of using Hive, Pig, or HBase for EMR jobs which one would be best for this type of analysis I dont think data analysis is gonna be on the terrabyte scale items in my tables are mostly under 1K. Ive also never used any of the three, but learning curve shouldnt be an issue. Im more concerned with what is going to be more efficient Im also handing this project off soon, so something that is relatively to understand for people with noSQL experience would be nice but Im mostly looking to make the sensible choice for the data I have. An example query I might make is something like Find all accounts between last week and today with an event value over 20 for each day.p

Negative 219 pAs a newbie to Cocoa and ObjectiveC I have a rudimentary understanding of KVC and KVO.  However with respect to Cocoa Bindings as covered in the Apple document titled Cocoa Bindings Programming Topics see figures 810 Im unclear why they are depicting using both KVC and KVO, when it seems that KVO would be sufficient.  KVOs ObserveValueForKeyPathofObjectchangecontext can provide the old and new values so why is KVC mechanisms needed  Note, I see how KVO decouples objects, but so does KVC.p  pThe example Apple gives figures 810 depicts a Window containing a slider and a text input control to visually represent and allow user interaction for settingampviewing temperature,  a Controller object, and a Model Object with a temperature property.  So put another way my question is why not just have a bidirectional KVO relationships between the 2 controls and the controller each registers with the other as an observer, and bidirectional KVO relationships between the Model Object and the Controller  Why is KVC neededp

Negative 219 pI have some issues with how sqlplus output is formatted for the terminal and I am just thinking of writing a script around sqlplus and fixing these.p  pOn the other hand, wow that seems really lame. Because Oracle has several tons of tools written. Yet it seems difficult to get what I want. Does anyone have another suggestionp  pFirst, I want smarter column widths. If I create a table with a column whose max size is 200 characters but then I put abc, xyz and 123 in it, do I need a 200space wide column on the terminal to display the contents I do not think so. I think I need 3 characters plus a couple for padding. Yet Oracle insists on giving me a 200character wide column. Unless there is somewhere to fix this.p  pSecond, I want easy access to a sideways display of the columns, like using G at the end of the command in MySQL. I know there is a way to do this in Oracle but it seemed complicated. Why could there not just be a simple switch Like a G at the end of the command There can be if I wrap the output to sqlplus and do this myself.p  pSo, the question seems to be this. Should I write a simple script around sqlplus to give me what I want, or is there a way to get Oracle to give me this behavior In sqlplus And if there is, how much extra information will I have to stuff into my head to make this work Because it does not seem as though it should be very complicated. But Oracle is certainly not making it easy.p

However, what I need is to be able to iterate through the already filtered items.p  pIf I already have this items... codefiltersSelected  [blue]codep  precode[blue, circle, number] [blue, square, number] [blue, triangle, letter]  codepre  pand click on number.  codefiltersSelected  [blue, number]code I only need these items to show until it gets the exact match. p  precode[blue, circle, number] [blue, square, number] codepre  pThanks in advance.p  hr  pHeres a snippet of code and how it currently works. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netathanphebLyV24 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netathanphebLyV24ap  pYoull see that I got 3 sets of filter. What I want is to filter exact items based on the filters chosen. If I click Blue all blue items will be shown, if I click Circle as my second filter, I only want to show blue and circle items, and so on...p

Negative 219 pAll,p  pI originally had a shell script that called SQLLoader Oracles data upload tool.p  pThe problem was that SQLLoader takes a plain text password as input so I decided to build a Java application to call SQLLoader internally passing a decrypted password into the command string.p  pe.g.p  blockquote   psqlldr userpassDBServer control..sqlloader.ctl logsqlloader.log datamydata.csvp blockquote  pSo with my java wrapper it became this in my shell scriptp  precodejava jar sqlloader.jar sqlloader.ctl mydata.csv codepre  pHowever a new problem developed when SQLLoader complained there was no file to load. After some head scratching it was discovered that a subsequent command in my shell script seemed to be executing while my java application was still running. Therefore it was behaving asynchronously.p  pThe next command was moving the input file sqlloader was using before it could get a chance to use it. So I put a sleep command in of 20 seconds to give my java application time to run.p  precodejava jar sqlloader.jar sqlloader.ctl mydata.csv echo  sleep 20 if [  ne 0 ]     then         echo SQLLoader failed during execution, please check the log            mv mydata.csv  else     echo SQLLoader successfully processed file       mv mydata.csv fi codepre  pDoes anyone know why unix is behaving this way, does Java execute my SQLLoader as a different user threadp  pThis is my java codep  precode    Runtime Rt Process Prc     Prc  Rt.execsqlldr userdecryptedpassDBServer control..sqlloader.ctl logsqlloader.log datamydata.csv system.exit0 codepre  pI checked the Runtime Class for anything about it being Asynchronous but couldnt find anythingp  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangRuntime.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangRuntime.htmlap  pAny theories or suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 219 pI suddenly encountered a strange behaviour. I create views completely dynamic.

The click is handled nice for the first button. The first control must top left receives the focus somehow by the runtime. But it is a strange focus. When I click on the other button, i have to click twice to process the event handler. And when I go back to the first button, I also have to click twice.p  pI found out, which line causes this behaviour.p  precode    this.setClickabletrue             this.setFocusabletrue                 this.setFocusableInTouchModetrue   lt this line. codepre  pI remmed this line for test purposes.  I now have another problem. I cannot get the focused control afterwards.  But I need the name of the focused control.  What can I do now  Will I have to create an attribute in my fragmentactivity of type View, which I will fill in the onClickListener  Or is there an internal mechanism  I surely must not use setFocusableInTouchModetrue, because the user will have to click twice. requestFocus does not  help, because onClick handler is processed AFTER the button was clicked ONCE. What can I do best in this case p  pI now experimented with the OnTouchEvent in order to get this solved. And it works. However, I do not know, if this is the right approach, or the best preactice. Is there no better way straight forward in order to use the simple onClick handler to recieve the focus of the clicked button AND process the onClick event handler in ONE single way p

Negative 219 pFirst, a bit of nomenclature clarifyingp  pIn ObjectiveC event handlers are defined through delegates. And a delegate may have multiple tasks, is this naming scheme rightp  pNow the actual question if a delegate has for example 6 tasks, can I disable at runtime having one of those tasks called without dettaching the whole delegatep  pI have a task that is called around 30 times a second and would like to disable it unless explicitly desired. I havent benchmarked it tho, maybe it isnt consuming as much CPU as I fear, but anyway, my question stil stays just to satisfy my curiosity.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 219 pIm creating a viewpager with around 45 tabs. All of the tabs will have a listview with different elements. Clearly, all the fragments can simply inflate a single layout file and add in their own stuff to the listview adapter.p  pEffectively Ill have a bunch of listviews side by side.p  pMy question is, if I can use a single layout file, can I also use a single fragment p  pI understand that the viewpager needs different fragments for each tab. But given that Im simply changing the verylight listview list item  1 textview in each of the tabs, can I somehow recycle the same fragment by using the position of the viewpager which tab is openedp  pAnyways, heres my TitleAdapterp  precodepublic class TitleAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter     private String titles[]  new String[]View1,View2,View3     private Fragment frags[]  new Fragment[titles.length]       public TitleAdapterFragmentManager fm          superfm         frags[0]  new FragmentView1         frags[1]  new FragmentView2         frags[2]  new FragmentView3           Override     public CharSequence getPageTitle int position         Log.vTitleAdapter  getPageTitle, titles[position]         return titles[position]           Override     public Fragment getItemint position          Log.vTitleAdapter  getItem, String.valueOfposition         return frags[position]           Override     public int getCount          return frags.length        codepre  pAs you can see, right now Ive got 3 fragments. But I dont want to head off in the wrong direction if theres a way that offers better performance or even a few kilobyte less app size. The FragmentViews are my fragments for each of the tab, in which Im inflating the same listview and putting different data in it.p  pSo, can a viewpager be used by reusing the same single fragment Or do I HAVE TO use multiple fragmentsp  pI want the best performance, thats it.p

Negative 219 pThe current approach in our software environment is to have several WCF services in an distributed SOA infrastructure. There are more than one service who provide the front website with information from stock exchange like stocks, bonds, currencies, mutual funds for example.p  pThe webservices query the database and we have ThreadCache straight from .net framework which caches the information for 35 minutes. If the cache is expired, it would be the enduser that invokes the method that is going to retrieve new information from the database. So the website is pretty fast except for the one that invokes the webservice with expired data....that user will have a pretty slow reponse time... probably about 1020 second p  pI want to feed this market information to a Redis service running on windows server in every 5 minutes.

Negative 219 pIm writting a Visual Studio Extension to inspect certain data types in the Visual Studio Debugger.  For this matter I would like to examine the contents of a large .NET array, e.g. a byte[] array. But I am struggeling on how to this efficiently. What I have so far is that I registered my class to receive DebugEvents and store the last thread everytime an event occursp  precodeIVsDebugger debugService   Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalServicetypeofSVsShellDebugger as IVsDebugger debugService.AdviseDebugEventCallbackthis ... public int EventIDebugEngine2 pEngine, IDebugProcess2 pProcess, IDebugProgram2 pProgram, IDebugThread2 pThread, IDebugEvent2 pEvent, ref Guid riidEvent, uint dwAttrib    lastThread  pThread  codepre  pTo inspect an object I dervive the Stackframe from the lastThread Object and obtain an IDebugExpressionContext2 from the Stackframe. Assuming there is an Oject called test wich has a byte[] proberty Matrix, I do the followingp  precodeIDebugExpression2 expression string error uint errorCharIndex  epressionContext.ParseTexttest.Matrix, enumPARSEFLAGS.PARSEEXPRESSION, 10,                             out expression, out error, out errorCharIndex IDebugProperty2 debugProperty  null expression.EvaluateSyncenumEVALFLAGS.EVALNOSIDEEFFECTS,1000, null, out                          debugProperty  DEBUGPROPERTYINFO[] info  new DEBUGPROPERTYINFO[1] debugProperty.GetPropertyInfoenumDEBUGPROPINFOFLAGS.DEBUGPROPINFOALL, 0, 1000,                              null, 0, info codepre  pThis all works fine and the info structure contains reasonable values. But if I try to get a IDebugMemoryByte2 object to read the contents of the byte[] array, I receive null.p  precodeIDebugMemoryContext2 memoryContext debugProperty.GetMemoryContextout memoryContext IDebugMemoryBytes2 memoryBytes debugProperty.GetMemoryBytesout memoryBytes codepre  pI could traverse the DEBUGPROPERTYSTRUCTURE and read every single element of the array but this would be way too slow. So whats the best way to do thisp

Let us suppose that in a certain game each player must be given with 6 cards. The number of players is 2. So, it is necessary to generate two arrays, each of them consists of 6 elements selected from a big array of 54 elements. Moreover, in those two generated arrays there should not be sharedduplicate elements.p  pI tried a recursive algorithm to obtain a sequence of emmem unique random numbers from 0 to m  1.p  pXn1  a  Xn  c mod mp  pYou need to set the parametersp  ul lim  module, m  0li lia  factor, 0 lt a lt mli lic  increment, 0 lt c lt mli liX0  initial value , 0 lt X0 lt mli liNumbers emcem and emmem must be coprime.li liema  1em is divisible by empem for each prime empem that is a divisor of emmemli liIf emmem is divisible by 4 then ema  1em must be divisible by 4.li ul  pHeres the code for this algorithm.

So I will need to change a, m, c and X0 between launches of my program. Then I will have another problem how to set these parameters automatically and randomly, too so that they satisfy the necessary conditions see the bulleted list above.p

Negative 219 pWe have a business model that requires, say, different types of vehicles to be identified.  For example, motorcycle, boat, yacht, farm equipment, snowmobiles, heavy truck, light truck, passenger car, and Other.p  pI think there are two ways to handle it Create a Vehicle class with a few subclasses, say, boat, truck, car and have a single enum indicating the actual type. This would work, allowing you to represent vehicles that share some common features with common subclasses. But it allows you to have mismatched enums with the classes.p  pI think the traditional way to handle it is to have a separate subclass for each type, which may subclass the vehicle, or a subclass of vehicle.  For example, heavy and light truck might subclass truck boat and yacht might subclass boat snowmobile might subclass vehicle.  The problem is, it doesnt really lend itself to representing the concept of other.p  pDoes anyone have any patterns or bestpractices for these sorts of scenariosp  pPeterp  pstrongEDITstrong The purpose of the object is to convey information about the vehicle and to be able to display that information in a userfriendly way.  For example, pull the data from a database and display it on a screen to be viewededited.p  pThis leads to another downside to the traditional OO means that leans away from type indicators for actual types, in that to display the type one would need to perform some sort of instanceof and convert the value to something userfriendly.p  pAlso, clarified I was talking about a single enum, not an enum per subclass.p

Negative 219 pWe have an EAR project with several submodules multiple EJBs, Web Projects, Application Clients, etc. The natural scope for unitary tests are their respective submodules since they are supposed to be testing isolated units.p  pIn a short amount of time we have introduced non obvious testing dependencies.

Negative 219 pI am using Parse. In the special Parse User class PFUser I added a property of type array to each user. Now, I want to be able to retrieveupdate this array. The array is called friendsList.p  pI am using the XcodeiOS Parse SDK. p  pEDIT I have tried a few different parse queries but theyre not working. Im guessing it has to do with the fact that when youre querying the special class name User you cant use a typical query like p  precode[PFQuery queryWithClassNameUser]  This is wrong. codepre  pWhat I am trying to accomplish is this currentUser tries to Add A Friend by Username. They type in the username, press Go, and I search the special User class with this code p  precodePFQuery friendQuery  [PFUser query] [friendQuery whereKeyusername equalTouserNameToAdd] [friendQuery getFirstObjectInBackgroundWithBlockPFObject object, NSError error         This is where I want to now push userNameToAdd onto the friendsList Array inside the currentUser, but I cant figure out how to retrieveupdate that Array called friendsList     codepre

Negative 219 pI am writing a reader for an embroidery machine file format in Ruby, which has two types of stitchesp  ul liRegular stitches Have a color and relative coordinates.li liJump stitches Also have a color and relative coordinates, but they are not visible threads will be removed by hand in the final embroidery and are not visible in any previews that may be generated and coordinate changes are usually much larger than for regular stitchesli ul  pIn Java, I would probably use an abstract base class Stitch and two classes JumpStitch and RegularStitch inheriting from it. I would then use either quick and dirty instanceof or overloaded methods handleJumpStitch stitch, handleRegularStitch stitch or something like that to do something with those I need the distinction between regular stitches and jump stitches.p  pHow would you achieve something similar in Ruby as Ruby lacks method overloading and instanceof being a big nono according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma38934033818564httpstackoverflow.coma38934033818564ap  pTwo use cases incorporated from my comments belowp  pI have a list of all consecutive stitches in a List  some of them are of type RegularStitch, the other ones of type JumpStitch. Now I want to do something with this list. Say, draw a preview.

Negative 219 pIm trying to implement polygon triangulation using the widely known 2pass sweep line algorithm that subdivides the polygon into monotone subcomponents in the first sweep line pass, then triangulates these monotone components in a second pass. My current implementation works for the general case, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to adapt it to deal with inputs containing multiple coincident edge segments segments with equal xcoordinates when sweeping lefttoright, or equal ycoordinates when sweeping righttoleft.p  pEdit  I just realized that the way I framed this question makes it quite long and verbose, so heres a quick TLDR for anyone who knows about polygonal triangulation but doesnt feel like reading the whole thing is the following shape a valid input for the 2nd pass of the triangulation algorithm If yes how to adapt the second pass to handle it, if no how do I adapt the 1st pass such that it produces monotone subcomponents that emcanem be fed into the 2nd passp  pa hrefhttpwww.wouterbijlsma.nlwoutertmpRTdr6rET9.png relnofollowhttpwww.wouterbijlsma.nlwoutertmpRTdr6rET9.pngap  pLong version of the question below this point p  pA very quick rundown of the algorithm p  ol lipThe first pass subdivides the input polygon into monotone subcomponents. A monotone subcomponent is a polygon can be split into 2 connected chains that have coordinates that are either sorted lefttoright when the algorithm is implemented using a vertical sweep line, or toptobottom when using a horizontal sweep line. Lets assume we use a vertical sweep line each monotone subcomponent can then be split into an upper chain, and a lower chain, connected at the minimum and maximum xcoordinates, and when scanning the vertices of either chain, the xcoordinates are increasing. If the subcomponent is emstrictly monontoneem, the upper and lower chains can not have edge segments with identical xcoordinates ie vertical edge segments.pli lipThe second pass sweeps the monotone subcomponents and subdivides them into triangles by adding internal edges. The idea is that each subcomponent is swept lefttoright, and at each vertex hit by the sweep line, one of 2 things can happen a the untriangulated area to the left of the sweep line can be triangulated by adding diagonals, or b the current vertex cannot see any of the previously swept, but unprocessed vertices in the untriangulated area to the left of the sweep line. In case b the vertex is pushed to a stack the reflex chain, and by construction, at some point case a will occur, and the vertices of the reflex chain will be popped onebyone and connected with diagonals to the last sweep line vertex.pli ol  pThe above description lacks some details, but I would assume anyone who knows how to answer my question already understands the algorithm so I wont go into more detail here.p  pThe problem I have is the following suppose I have a polygon representing an arrow that points left, for example like thisp  pa hrefhttpwww.wouterbijlsma.nlwoutertmpRTdr6rET9.png relnofollowhttpwww.wouterbijlsma.nlwoutertmpRTdr6rET9.pngap  pWhen I enter this shape into my algorithm, the monotone subdivision pass leaves the shape untouched there are vertical edges in it, so its not emstrictlyem monotone, but it is monotone, and as far as I understand the algorithm, it does not have to be subdivided before you can triangulate it maybe this is where I go wrong because my assumption is bad.p  pNow suppose I feed the unmodified arrow polygon into the 2nd pass to triangulate it. How do I deal with the 2 vertical edge segments in the base of the arrow head The sweep line algorithm requires the vertices of the polygon to be sorted left to right, so you would assume the answer would come down to how to sort vertices with the same xcoordinates e.g. in chain order, or on ycoordinate, or on polygon boundary index, but whatever sorting I use, the triangulation will always fail.p  pLets call the leftmost vertex vertex 0, and order the vertices in counterclockwise order. This means the 4 vertices of the base of the arrow head are vertices 1, 2, 5 and 6. We have three sorting optionsp  ol lipSome of the source material I used to implement the algorithm says sort vertices with equal x coordinates on increasing y coordinates, ie 1, 2, 5, 6. If I do this and sweep them, the first triangle comes out ok 0, 1, 2, but after that the algorithm will add an edge 5, 2, which creates a 4vertex component 0, 2, 5, 6. No edge 0, 5 is added, because the triangulation algorithm prescribes adding edges to all previous untriangulated vertices on the reflex chain emexcept the firstem changing this would break the general case. While the polygon region bounded by the 4 vertices is triangular in shape, its obviously not a triangle because it has 4 points, and its also not a valid polygon by most definitions because it has collinear edges.pli lipAnother paper I read says break ties such that the chain order is preserved. This would mean the 4 vertices in my example would be sorted 1, 2, 6, 5, since both the lower and upper chain run lefttoright. If I sweep them in this order I again get a triangle 0, 1, 2, but the next vertex scanned 6, will create a polygon 0, 1, 6, which is even worse then the first case because it creates an edge 1, 6 which runs over vertex 5 but doesnt contain it. Sweeping vertex 5 will completely mess up the state of the algorithm because it will create a degenerate triangle 1, 5, 6, a line, and sweeping the tail vertices will fail to triangulate the remainder of the polygonpli lipSorting in original polygon vertex order along boundary, counterclockwise in this case this would yield the same result as case 1, ie 1, 2 5, 6, which has already been shown to fail.pli ol  pIm starting to think that maybe an arrow shape like this should either be considered nonmonotone, or even though I have never seen this mentioned in any description of the algorithm the monotone triangulation algorithm requires inputs to be emstrictlyem monotone. Could this be the thing Im missing And if yes, how would I need to adapt the monotone subdivision pass to deal with multiple, coincident vertical edge segments The source material I used classifies all vertices as start, end, merge, split or regular lowerupper during subdivision, but in case of a vertical segment, these classifications are ambiguous according to the definition of these vertex classes, a vertex part of a vertical segment could considered to be a startend vertex, but also a split or merge vertex. Or maybe I emdoem have to sort the 4 vertices on their ycoordinates, then create an invalid 4vertex triangle component with 2 collinear edges, and then fix it up afterwards by removing the vertex on the collinear edgesp  pThe main source I used to implement the algorithm is the original GJPT78 paper that introduced the triangulation algorithm, its not publicly available paywall, so I cant link it here, but lots of CS course material is available online that describes the algorithm, I also used these for examplep  pa hrefhttpwww.cs.ucsb.edusurics235Triangulation.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cs.ucsb.edusurics235Triangulation.pdfa a hrefhttpswww.cs.umd.educlassspring2012cmsc754Lectscmsc754lects.pdf relnofollowhttpswww.cs.umd.educlassspring2012cmsc754Lectscmsc754lects.pdfa see Lecture 6 chapterp  pIve read quite a few more of these. Almost every set of slides, paper, blog, or whatever other description of the algorithm emspecificallyem mentions vertices with equal xcoordinates or ycoordinates if using a horizontal sweep line, but they emallem just say we assume no equal xcoordinates and that this restriction is easily fixed and only serves to simplify representation or not fundamental to the algorithm or whatever. Strangely emnoneem of them cares to elaborate on the required changes or workarounds to support this case, or they contain some fuzzy statement about sorting equal xvertices in some way that in practice does not fix the problem.p  pMaybe Im just a little stupid or missing something really obvious, but Ive been messing around trying to fix this corner case for days now without result, and its starting to get really frustrating. I had assumed implementing the algorithm for the basic case which involves writing a DCEL data structure, a sweep line algorithm, a sorted edge map, the trigonometry required to determine interior angles and visibility, data structures to efficiently store and lookup vertex classifications, etc would be almost all of the work, and fixing the vertical edge problem afterwards would be trivial. Right now I spent more time trying to fix the vertical edges, than on all of the other stuff I needed to get the algorithm working for the general case combined it works perfectly for any polygon I throw at it, as long as it doesnt have vertical edges.p  pThanks Wouterp

For the most part the two work together pretty nicely, however, I have run into a bit of a problem.p  pWhat I want to do is load data from a local database, but not all at once. The reason is that it loads thousands of records which is quite slow. Instead, I would like to do with indexedDB what I have been doing server side where I send over a chunk of records and a total count of how many records there actually are. DataTables is able to use those two peices of information to paginate correctly.p  pHowever, this uses the fnAjaxSource option which takes a url. I need to to take a function that returns data somehow. I havent found anyone doing quite the same thing. Currently I am using DataTables 1.9 for the project, however, I would be able to user 1.10 for this and similar pages if that is required. However, going through the API and documentation hasnt shown me any ways to tell DataTables to expect more records than it receives. If there is any other information you need from me please let me know, but I cant really post an example since I dont know what Im doing. Im hoping theres an easy option, or some way I could write a plug in that does this, but I havent seen anything that gives me hope.p  pa hrefhttpdatatables.netforumsdiscussion23760tryingtodoclientsidelazyloadingusingindexeddb relnofollowI have asked the question similarly on the DataTables forum here.ap  pI should clarify that I am not having issues with IndexedDB really.

Negative 219 pI am writing a drawing editor using jqueryui where you can addremove shapes and move and resize them. This all works fine.

Negative 219 pIm struggling with coming up with the right way to capture audit information via a REST service.  Lets say Ive got an internal REST API for an Employee resource.  I want to capture things when an Employee is addedmodifiedremoved such as the user who did the change, the application the user was using, when it was done assume this could be asynchronous so the users action may have taken place at a different time than the REST call, etc.  Also, the user that initiated the change may not be the authenticated user making the REST call.p  pMy thoughts are that those properties do not belong in the body of the request  meaning that they are not attributes of the Employee object.  They are not something that would be retrieved and returned on a GET, so they shouldnt be in the POSTPUT.  They also do not belong as a parameter because parameters should be for specifying additional things about Employees or a searchfilter critiera on GET requests for Employees.p  pMy current thoughts are to have the client specify this information in the HTTP headers.  That keeps the URL parameters amp body pure for the Employee resource.  Is that an appropriate use of the headers  Are there other options that Im not seeingp

Negative 219 pIs there a way to resetclear a codeCOOKIEcode variable each iteration iteration of a thread in a thread groupp  pemClear cookies each iterationem option is set in the HTTP Cookie Manager. The problem is that codeCOOKIEvarscode do not get reset when the thread restarts but the real cookies do, as they should. This is seen when logging it with codesamplevariablescode option.p  pHave triedp  ul liusing emUser Defined Variablesem, but that only seems to run on the first iterationli liusing emBeanShell Samplerem with codevars.putCOOKIEvar, nullcode works, except that you get a useless extra sample in the log, which is not acceptableli liusing a BeanShell prepost processor with the same code doesnt work because the exact first sample is not always known user configurableli ul  pSo if there was a way to execute some code without a sample log entry being generated, that would solve it. But havent found anything to just run some code, nor any way to cancel the sample in BeanShell Sampler so that there would be no log of it.p

Negative 219 pI am on a Windows machine trying to create a Dart server. I had success building and image with my files with codeADDcode and running the container. However, it is painful to build an image every time I want to test my code so I thought it would be better to mount my files with the codevcode command since they are access live from my host machine at runtime.p  pThe problem is that darts packages folder at codebinpackagescode is really a symlink if its called symlink in windows and docker or boot2docker or whatever doesnt seem able to go past it and I getp  precodeProtocol error, errno  71 codepre  pIve used dart with GAE and the codegcloudcode command somehow created the container, got your files in there and reacted to changes in your host files. I dont know if they used the codevcode option as I am trying or they have some autobuilder that created a new image with your files using codeADDcode and the ran it, in anycase that seemed to work.p  pstrongMore Infostrongp  pIve been using this Dockerfile that I modified from a hrefhttpsregistry.hub.docker.comugoogledart relnofollowgoogledartap  precodeFROM googledart  RUN ln s usrlibdart usrlibdartbindartsdk  WORKDIR app   ADD pubspec. app  RUN pub get  ADD . app  RUN pub get offline  WORKDIR appbin  ENTRYPOINT dart CMD server.dart codepre  pAs you see, most of it is commented out because instead of codeADDcode Id like to use codevcode. However, you can notice that on this script they do codepub getcode twice, and that effectively creates the packages stronginsidestrong the container.p  pUsing codevcode it cant reach those packages because they are behind emhost symlinksem. However, codepub getcode actually takes a while as it install the standard packages plus your added dependencies. It this the only wayp

Negative 219 pIm working on a JComboBox component that should have autocomplete behavior. In order to not reinvent the wheel Ive used a hrefhttpdownload.java.netjavadesktopswinglabsreleases0.8docsapiorgjdesktopswingxautocompletepackagesummary.html relnofollowSwingX autocomplete decoratora. Now, as far as I can see from the examples, the list used for autocompletion is static the component is given a list when created and the list is not changed. In this conditions the autocomplete behavior works perfectly.  However I want to use the autocomplete on a dynamic list extracted from the database with a query that uses the input in the combobox.p  pI tried with something like thisp  precodecomboBox.addActionListenernew ActionListener       Override     public void actionPerformedActionEvent e          String inputText  JTextFieldcomboBox.getEditor.getEditorComponent.getText          if inputText.length gt 2              if comboBoxChanged.equalse.getActionCommand                  patients  service.searchPatientinputText                 ifpatients.size 0                     System.out.printlnempty              else                  System.out.printlne.getActionCommand                            codepre  pBut unfortunately Ive noticed that this event fires after the keyListeners on the editor component, with the result that the list is not consistent with what the user is typing.p  pDo you have an example of Swingx applied to a dynamic list Thanks a lotp

Negative 219 pIve seen quite a few questionsforum posts regarding this scenario but I either dont understand the solutions or the solutions provided are too specific to that particular question and I dont know how to apply it to my situation.  I have the following queryp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT d. FROM Data d JOIN Customers c  ON c.CustomerName  d.CustomerName AND c.subMarket  d.subMarket JOIN Sort s  ON s.Market  c.Market ORDER BY d.CustomerName, d.Category, d.Tab, d.SubMarket, CASE s.sortBy WHEN CompRank THEN d.CompRank WHEN MarketRank THEN d.MarketRank ELSE d.OtherRank END codepre  pI used that exact query on my MySQL database and it worked perfectly.  We recently switched over to a SQL Server database and now it doesnt work and I get the errorp  precodeORDER BY items must appear in the select list if SELECT DISTINCT is specified. codepre  pstrongIve tried adding s. to the SELECT since s.sortBy is in the CASE and that didnt change anything and I also tried listing out every single field in Data and Sort in SELECT and that resulted in the same exact error.strong  p  pThere actually arent duplicates in Data, but when I do the joins it results in 4 exact duplicate rows for every single item and I dont know how to fix that so thats why I originally added the DISTINCT.  I tried variations of LEFT JOINs, INNER JOINs, etc... and couldnt get a different result.  Anyway, a solution to either issue would be fine but Im assuming more information would be needed to figure out the JOIN duplicate issue. p  pEdit  I just realized that I mistakenly typed some of the fields in the ORDER BY example, n.Category, n.Tab should have been d.Category, d.Tab.  EVERYTHING in the ORDER BY is from the Data table which Ive selected  from.  As I said, I also tried listing out every field in the SELECT and that didnt help.p

Negative 219 pI followed a tutorial and built a JNI interface in Android studio. But I dont know how to add more to it by calling other functions in my C library. I am not even sure if I can see my library yet I figure if I call one of the functions I would know. So my question is I do not understand the file in my JNI folder. I see it is written in C. Why is the include different from the usual C includes I have seen which is something like include  or I believe you can also say include foo.c also Why are there s in the package names How do I call a function in one of my libraries two levels below the JNI folder I read the JNI specification and still dont understand how JNIenv works.  p  pFor example, just to test this, I tried adding random.c to my file. It is located two levels below my JNI folder ndkbuilder says there is no such file. So I think I need to work on my Andorid.mk and make sure the build environment has visibility to random.c. Is that true Can I somehow specify the fully qualified path to random.c p  precodeinclude comexamplesansarindktestMainActivity.h include ltrandom.cgt   JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL    JavacomexamplesansarindktestMainActivityHelloJNI    JNIEnv env, jobject obj   envgtNewStringUTFenv,Hi From Sean  codepre  pJP Thanks.

Negative 219 pHow do people deal with index data the data usually shown on index pages, like a customer list vs the model detail datap  pWhen somebody goes to the customerindex route  they only need access to a small subset of the full customer resource.   Since I am dealing with legacy data, my customer model has  10 relationships.   It seems wasteful to have the api return a complete and full customer representation for every customer just to render a listselectindex view.p  pI know those relationships are somewhat lazyloaded, but it still takes effort on the backend to pull all those relationships in.   For some relationships such as customerinvoices this could be a large list of ids.p

Negative 219 pI am looking for an algorithm and hopefully a .net implementation that can do the following I have the following datap  ol lia list of technicians each one with different skills could be more than one.li lia service time window e.g. 812li lia list of all previously scheduled jobs within this time window each with its required skillsli ol  pgiven a new job with required skills, I am supposed to check if the new job and be assigned to any of the technicians available previous jobs may be moved between technicians as long as their skills support it. also the service time window cannot be exceeded so a 1 hour job cannot scheduled for 1130p  pInitially I thought about doing bin packing FFD variant were I preload the bins technicians and when looking for a bin to place a job I would also check for skill matching. The job list would contain all previous jobs and the new one sorted descending by size and either the code stops because a job cannot be placed in any bin or it finishes after all jobs have been scheduled.p  pIn theory it could work but then I thought of the following scenariop  ul liTechnicians T1with skills S1 amp S2, T2with skills S2 amp S3li liPrevious jobs J1 requires skill S2, Duration the whole time window.li liNew Job J2 requires skill S1li ul  pA case could happen that J1 is assigned to T1 and then J2 has no place to fit. p  pSo I thought about adding a second sort to the job list Jobs will be sorted by size descending and then by the number of resources who can actually do them ascending.

Negative 219 pI have a controller fr each site in my angularJS application.  In this case I have one site with the form for creating a user and if form is submitted, user is navigated to a success page which summarizes user creation and provides info about created user. p  pAt the bottom there are the two controllers. My approach is that after server response I set username, passwords and roles in rootScope.

Negative 219 pIm trying to help a customer with this old 2010 application built with Grails 1.3.1. Its a part of a larger system. We have the source code and a number of running instances including a test rig, but the original developers are long gone. The customer needs to make a really small change to the application. Its in just one groovy file. Ive managed to open the project in Eclipse Luna and installed GGTS. It looks ok, and Eclipse outputs class files to the targeteclipse directory. p  pThe plan is to just replace the affected class file directly on the test machine running the application. Problem is it doesnt work. It runs on Tomcat6, but I cant find anything relevant in the logs which is also strange  the application just dosent start if I replace this one class file. My best guess is that its because the groovy compiler on my machine used by GGTS is much newer than that on the test rig. Grails 1.3.1 contans groovyall1.7.2.jar, wich I believe is the same as the compiler version, and I cant find it as a downloadable tool anymore, or as a Eclipse plugin it only supports version 2.X and later.p  pAny suggestions Can I somehow compile the file using the old version of groovy in the jar Quick and dirty fixes are welcome. They want to avoid upgrading the running systems, because that will probably require a lot of work. They say will replace the whole system soon anyway, but need to fix this asap. You know how it is.p  pIve never used Groovy or Grails before but Im a fairly experienced Java developer.p  pThank youp

I am not looking to combine keys, so Im using Keys.Menu. I do find it strange that for Shift, there is a Keys.ShiftKey, but for Alt its called Keys.Menu. Why not just call it Keys.AltKey Confusingp  pAnyway, the code is working correctly. However, there seems to be a default function of the Alt key. For example, when I am typing something in a document or whatever and I press Alt, the insertion point cursor disappears, as if the current window or task was deselected.p  pThis default function of the Alt key is problematic to my program, so Ive done some searching and found the following code in order to disable itp  precode    protected override bool ProcessDialogKeyKeys keyData              if keyData amp Keys.Alt  Keys.Alt             return true         else             return base.ProcessDialogKeykeyData      codepre  pWith this code put in, the Alt keys default function has been disabled. However, it seems that the Alt key has also become completely nonfunctional and no longer performs the task of doing something like I had programmed it to do.p  pIs there any way to disable the Alt keys default function without causing it to become a nonfunctional keyp
Negative 219 pIm trying to upload to github from a program that has svn commit commands.

Negative 219 pI want to use a cache to hold recently accessed objects that just came from a database read. p  pThe database primary key, in my case, will be a Long. p  pIn each case Ill have an Object Case Class that represents this data. p  pThe combination of the Long plus the full class name will be a unique identifier for finding any specific object. The namespace should never have an conflicts as class names do not use numbers as a rule. In any case for this usage case I control the entire name space so not a huge concern.p  pThe objects will be relatively short lived in the cache  I just see a few situations where I can save memory by holding the same immutable Object more than once as opposed to different instances of the same Object that would be extremely difficult to pass everything everywhere to avoid.p  pThis also would help performance in situations where different eyeballs are checking out the same stuff but this is not the driver for this particular use case just gravy. p  pMy concern is now for strongeverystrong strongtimestrong I need a given object Ill need to recreate the cache key. This will involve a Long.toString and a String Concat. The case classes in question have a val in their companion object so that they know their class name without any further reflection occurring. p  pIm thinking of putting a cache together in the companion object for the main cache keys as I wish to avoid the needless repeat ops per lookup as well as the resultant garbage collection etc. The fastest code to run is the code that never gets written or called  right p  pIs there a more elegant way to handle this Has someone else already solved this specific problem p  pI thought of writing a key class but even with a val lazy or otherwise for the hash and toString I still get a hit for each and every object I ask for as now I have to create the key object each time. That could of course go back into the companion object key cache but if I go to the trouble of setting up that companion object cache for keys the key object approach is redundant. p  pAs a secondary ask of this question  assuming I use a Long and a full class name as a String which is most likely to get the quickest pull for the cache p  precodeLong.toString  fullClassName codepre  por p  precodefullClassName  Long.toString codepre  pThe Long IS a string in the key so assuming it is a string find on the cache which would be easier to index find The numeric portion first or the string class name. p  pNumbers first means you wade through ALL the objects with matching numbers searching for the matching class whereas class first means you find the block of a particular class first but you have to go to the very end of the string to find the exact match. p  pI suspect the former might be more easily optimized for a fast find I know in MySQL terms it would be...p  pThen again perhaps someone already has a dualkey lookup based cache p

The codeJsonPropertycode annotations on my codeFizzcode class have meaning to Dropwizard. The codeProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSONcode annotation on the codeFizzResourcecode also plays a critical role. Im worried that making my Dropwizard app readwrite protobufgenerated binary is not as easy as the 1liner posted in the docs.p  pIm not married to this library. If anyone has any experience setting up REST endpoints in a Dropwizard app to acceptreceive protobufgenerated binary, all I care about is a working, efficient solution. Ideasp

This is where I ask the clever minds of stack overflow, if any of you know of a way to see if the network a computer is currently connected to, is indeed the network of the domain to which the computeruser belongsp  pI have been looking at a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.environment.userdomainname28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowEnvironment.UserDomainNamea and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.directoryservices.activedirectory.domain.getcomputerdomain28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowDomain.GetComputerDomaina. Both of these could help me find the domain name, in theory not tested, but expect it to work, but none of them helps me to find whether or not the current network is the domain network.p  pAny constructive feedback is very much appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrong At some point this addon is supposed to be sold to various customers, so I cant rely on something as simple as the IP looking in a specific way. The solution must be something that can work regardless of the network the computer is connected to.p
