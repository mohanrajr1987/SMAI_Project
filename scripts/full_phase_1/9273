Though this sample has a meager two fields, the actual class being serialized has around 100 fields.p  pstrongSo, how can I control the name of both the root element and the immediate child elements when directly serializing a codeListltMyClassgtcode objectstrongp  pThe objective is to get XML looking like thisp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltArrayOfPersongt   ltPersongt     ltNamegtJohn DoeltNamegt     ltAgegt57ltAgegt   ltPersongt   ltPersongt     ltNamegtDoe, JaneltNamegt     ltAgegt   ltPersongt ltArrayOfPersongt codepre  pBy changing the override values, I should be able to generate XML like this from the same classp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltArrayOfEmployeegt   ltEmployeegt     ltNamegtJohn DoeltNamegt     ltAgegt57ltAgegt   ltEmployeegt   ltEmployeegt     ltNamegtDoe, JaneltNamegt     ltAgegt   ltEmployeegt ltArrayOfEmployeegt codepre  pHere is some simplified code that demonstrates my problem.

Positive 9273 pI have a bunch of classes that were autogenerated from an XSD, and provided to me in a compiled DLL for which I dont have the source code.

However, that is NOT true if the serialization attributes change in the underlying DLL.

Negative 9273 pIm confused about what the various testing appliances in Ruby on Rails are for. I have been using the framework for about 6 months but Ive never understood the testing part of it. The only testing Ive used is JUnit3 in Java and that only briefly.p  pEverything Ive read about it just shows testing validations. Shouldnt the validations in  rails just work It seems more like testing the framework than testing the your code. Why would you need to test validations p  pFurthermore, the tests seem super fragile to any change in your code. So if you change anything in your models, you have to change your tests and fixtures to match. Doesnt this violate the DRY principlep  pThird, writing test code seems to take alot of time. Is that normal Wouldnt it just be faster to refresh my browser and see if it worked I already have to play with my application just to see if it flows correctly and make sure my CSS hasnt exploded. Why wouldnt manual testing be enoughp  pIve asked these questions before and I havent gotten more than automated testing is automated. I am smart enough to figure out the advantages of automating a task. My problem is that costs of writing tests seem absurdly high compared to the benefits. That said, any detailed response is welcome because I probably missed a benefit or two.p

Negative 9273 pI need to have a drop down list in which the user selects the day of the week they want to come in every week. The values will never change right.  Its just Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday right  It seems like more work than needed to make a table and put the days of the week in. I certainly dont need the ability to create, update or delete them.  Is there a simple way to handle something like this Or maybe instead of days of the week it could be status like off, park, reverse, neutral, drive.

Negative 9273 pThe project Im working on requires me to write lots of repetitive code. For example, if I want to load a image file called logo.png in my code, I would write something like this Bitmap logoImagep  precode...  Init logoImage  loadlogo.png  ...  Usage logoImage.draw0, 0  ..  Cleanup logoImage.release codepre  pHaving to write this code to use every new image is a pain, including having to specify that logoImage should load the file logo.png.p  pAs Im working on a Java Android game and images are used a lot in inner loops, I really want to avoid slow things like making virtual function calls and e.g. accessing arraysmapsobject fields when I can avoid it. Copying an idea from the Android API the generated R class, I thought I could run a utility before compiling to generate some of this repetitive code for me. For example, the actual code in the project file would be reduced to just thisp  precodelogoImage.draw0, 0 codepre  pUsing some commandline tools e.g. grep, sed, I can look for every instance of Image.draw... and then generate the other required code automatically i.e. code to loadrelease the file .png and declare Bitmap logoImage somewhere. This code could either be added to a new class or I could add placeholders in my code that told the code generator where to insert the generated code.p  pTo display a new image, all I would need to do is just copy the image file to the right directory and add one line of code. Nice and simple. This avoid approaches like creating an array of images, defining labelled int constants to references the array and having to specify which filename to load.p  pIs this a really bad idea It seems a bit of a hack but I can see no easier way of doing this and it does seem to drastically clean up my code. Are there any standard tools for doing this simple kind of code generation i.e. the tool doesnt need to understand the meaning of the code Does anyone else do things like this to make up for language featuresp
Negative 9273 pWhat is the fastest way to find if a number is even or oddp
Negative 9273 pI have been thinking and learning a lot about forms lately trying to add advanced extensions to the a hrefhttpspreecommerce.com relnofollowSpree ECommerce Platforma Subscriptions, Events, Donations, and all kinds of Surveys.p  pEvery example I have ever encountered in a hrefhttpryandaigle.comarticles200921whatsnewinedgerailsnestedattributes relnofollowblogsa, in the a hrefhttpapi.rubyonrails.orgclassesActionViewHelpersFormHelper.html relnofollowdocsa, in a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes75complexformspart3 relnofollowscreencastsa, in a hrefhttpgithub.comjeffpwizardly relnofollowsource codea, etc. make forms out of a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgactiverecordquerying.html relnofollowModelsa, but they never go to anything emsemistructuredem or emunstructuredem or just really dynamic.  So you have forms likep  ol liContact Form User Model, maybe divided into an Address Model tooli liRegistration Form User Model, Account Model, Address Model, etc.li liBlog Post Form Post Model, Tag Model, etc.li liCheckout Form Shipping Model, Order Model, LineItem Model, etc.li ol  pAll of those make perfect sense They are the culmination of 10s of thousands, millions even, of man hours.  Tons of people have slowly abstracted those things down into nearly universal models that could be saved into a database table.  So now we all create models for them and make database tables for them.p  pBut there are so many other things that cant be boiled down to those specific models.  Things like a survey for a specific event, with form fields such asp  ol liAre you Pregnantli liHow many kids do you haveli liHave you ever been sickli liWhats your fastest mileli ol  pIf we started to save those things to the database in tables, we would have 100s and 1000s of database tables, one for each set of questions, or survey.p  pSo my thinking is, theres got to be some point at which you stop creating specific models like the Post and the Order and start just making a Form or Survey model Form  Survey  Questionnaire to some degree.p  pEverything would be boiled down to these few modelsp  ol liSurveyli liQuestionli liAnswerli liResponseSet answers to questions in surveyli liResponse specific response in response setli ol  pAnd from those you could create any type of Form you wanted.p  pSo my question is basically When do you, in the most practical, daytoday client projects, stop making forms with a bunch of models in them a Checkout form is a form for the Order basically in Spree, but that easily requires 10 database models, and just start using QuestionAnswer or FieldInput or KeyValue  Practicallyp  pIm just looking for something like when we built our online tutoring system, we didnt end up creating a bunch of SomeTutorialModel objects which extend TutorialModel, because that wouldve added too many tables to our database.  Instead, we just used the a hrefhttpgithub.combreakpointersurveyor relnofollowSurveyor gema.  Something along those lines .p  pTheres not much out there on this emsemistructuredem type of data, but lots when you can boil it down to something super concrete.p  pIt seems that if you used a Document Database, like CouchDB, youd end up being able to create all kinds of Model objects in ruby for example, and could get them out with some a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgcouchdbViewcollation relnofollowclever view tricksa.  But with MySQL and thelike, it seems insane.p

Negative 9273 pguys, My dev environment is VS2008, DX9, Windows XP. I try to add protection handling to the out of memory case. When malloc return NULL, I would page some resource to disk, and release the resources in the memory.p  pBut sometimes, malloc always return NULL, even if I release most of resources and process memory usage and VM size is only 800MB in task manager.p  pI think to use malloc to allocate 88 bytes should be fine, where process memory usage is only 800MB. But malloc always return NULL.p  pCould this be memory fragmentation It doesnt look like that, since process memory usage is not too much.p  pimg srchttpi.imagehost.org0267Snap2.jpg altalt textp

I also noticed that the System.Drawing assembly was not automatically added to the references when I created a new WPF project.p  blockquote   pstrongSystem.Drawing Namespacestrongp      pThe System.Drawing namespace provides access to GDI basic graphics functionality. More advanced functionality is provided in the System.Drawing.Drawing2D, System.Drawing.Imaging, and System.Drawing.Text namespaces.p      pThe Graphics class provides methods for drawing to the display device. Classes such as Rectangle and Point encapsulate GDI primitives. The Pen class is used to draw lines and curves, while classes derived from the abstract class Brush are used to fill the interiors of shapes.p      pstrongCautionstrongp      pClasses within the System.Drawing namespace are not supported for use within a Windows or ASP.NET service. Attempting to use these classes from within one of these application types may produce unexpected problems, such as diminished service performance and runtime exceptions.p blockquote  p a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.drawing.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.drawing.aspxap

Negative 9273 pI need a singleton in my code. I implemented it in Java and it works well. The reason I did it, is to ensure that in a mulitple environment, there is only one instance of this class.p  pBut now I want to test my Singleton object locally with a Unit test. For this reason I need to simulate another instance of this Singleton the object that would be from another device. So is there a possiblity to instantiate a Singleton a second time for testing purpose or do I have to mock itp  pIm not sure, but I think it could be possible by using a different class loaderp

Negative 9273 pIm looking to improve the D garbage collector by adding some heuristics to avoid garbage collection runs that are unlikely to result in significant freeing.  One heuristic Id like to add is that GC should not be run more than once per X amount of time maybe once per second or so.  To do this I need a timer with the following propertiesp  ol lipIt must be able to grab the correct time with minimal overhead.  Calling codecore.stdc.timecode takes an amount of time roughly equivalent to a small memory allocation, so its not a good option.pli lipIdeally, should be crossplatform both OS and CPU, for maintenance simplicity.pli lipSuper high resolution isnt terribly important.  If the times are accurate to maybe 14 of a second, thats good enough.pli lipMust work in a multithreadedmultiCPU context.  The x86 coderdtsccode instruction wont work.pli ol  pEDIT  The plain old C function codeclockcode seems fast enough.  However, here overflow is a problem.  On 32bit Windows and Linux, codeclocktcode is defined as a 32bit signed integer.  When it overflows, does it become negative, or does the codeclockcode function use extra logic to make it wrap to zero instead  If it wraps to zero, then this will do the trick.  If it wraps to negative which also represents error codes, etc. then it isnt going to work.p  pEdit  2  I tried the heuristic out anyhow, using codeclockcode and ignoring the overflow issue, just as a test.  It performs so poorly that its not worth further investigation.p

Negative 9273 pI have a table with objects and related tables objectinfo, objecttheme category, locations and the object owners.p  pWhat I want is showing all objects from object owners with a higher priority first, and then the rest.

Negative 9273 pUltimately Im going to convert this into a HibernateJPA design. But I wanted to start out from purely a database perspective.

But lets say Employee A has id  1, effectiveFrom  112011, effectiveTo  112099. That employee is going to be changing jobs in the future, which would in theory create a new row, id  2 with effectiveFrom  712011, effectiveTo  112099, and id  1s effectiveTo updated to 6302011. But now, my program would have to go through any table that has a FK relationship to employee every night, and update those FK to reference the newlyeffective employee entry.p  pI have seen various postings in both pure SQL and Hibernate forums that I should have a separate employeeversions table, which is where I would have all effectivedated data stored, resulting in the updated pseudodefinition belowp  pemployeep  ul liid INT AUTOINCREMENTli ul  pemployeeversionsp  ul liid INT AUTOINCREMENTli liemployeeid INT FK employee.idli li... data fields ...li lieffectiveFrom DATEli lieffectiveTo DATEli ul  pemployeereviewsp  ul liid INT AUTOINCREMENTli liemployeeid INT FK employee.idli ul  pThen to get any actual data, one would have to actually select from employeeversions with the proper employeeid and date range. This feels rather unnatural to have this secondary versions table for each versioned entity.p  pAnyone have any opinions, suggestions from your own prior work, etc Like I said, Im taking this purely from a general SQL design standpoint first before layering in Hibernate on top.

But having a go at an actual implementation raises some questions.p  pIm using JOliviers EventStore which seems nice. For starters Ill ignore the concept of SnapShots and just look at a way to get my events out. All I could get going is this codep  precodevar commitList  Store.GetFromDateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds1 foreach var commit in commitList      foreach var comittedEvent in commit.Events              if comittedEvent.Body is SomeDomainEvent             Console.WriteLinestring.FormatFound interesting event 0, SomeDomainEventcomittedEvent.Body.Value       codepre  pFirst question here is of course Is this the way to do it Im having trouble using the parameter for GetFrom since its just a DateTime and I cant be sure that all servers are in sync timewise. What if the the clock on one server is 1 minut behind another Or  hour Im also using NServiceBus so the new handler queue will pile up events from a certain point in time  but how can I be 100 sure that there isnt 10 seconds missing here Please tell me how you get events out of the EventStore while being 100 not 99 sure that the new application view is completely in sync when started.p  pAlso Do you create a special import method in your code I mean, suppose the handler in my new application sends out an email when it handles SomeDomainEvent.

Negative 9273 pI am right now reading this book , C templates  Complete guide. At a para i got stuck couldnt understand the terminology , here is the parap  blockquote   pA fundamental principle is that any template argument must be a   quantity or value that can be determined at compile time. As becomes   clear later, this requirement translates into dramatic benefits for   the runtime costs of template entities. strongBecause template parameters   are eventually substituted by compiletime values, they can themselves   be used to form compiletime expressions. This was exploited in the   ArrayInClass template to size the member array array. The size of an   array must be a socalled constantexpression, and the template   parameter N qualifies as such.strongp      pWe can push this reasoning a little further strongBecause template   parameters are compiletime entities, they can also be used to create   valid template arguments. Here is an examplestrong p blockquote  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt  class Dozen     public      ArrayInClassltT,12gt contents   codepre  blockquote   pNote how in this example the name T is both a template parameter and a   template argument. Thus, a mechanism is available to enable the   construction of more complex templates from simpler ones. Of course,   this is not fundamentally different from the mechanisms that allow us   to assemble types and functions.p blockquote  pI am unable to understand anything. I appreciate any help with simple and understanding words a lot.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pArrayinclassp  precodetemplate lttypename T, int Ngt  class ArrayInClass     public      T array[N]   codepre
Negative 9273 pI have a page that checks to see if the user logged in and if the user is not, uses an jQuery ajax call to a php processing page to get the information.

So far the only way Ive been able to get it to work is to use this insteadp  precodeString.Format0C, item.Price codepre  pBut if its possible, Id rather use Html.DisplayFor as its designed to handle things like nulls. I know its going to be 0 or more. In fact with the validation itll always be some amount  but I want to make sure there isnt a more correct way of doing this before I carry on.p  pAny information on this would be most appreciatedp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pDarin answered and pointed out that it does work, which caused me to go back over what I was actually sending over to the view. I realised that although I have a class called ProductModel, which has the DisplayFormat attribute, I was actually returning another model which contains a list of products. This is called ProductListModel and I realised that it returned a list of the Product data class  not the ProductModel classp  pSo in the end it was actually very simple. Just wish I hadnt wasted half an evening on it. Thanks for inspiring me to go back and check properly, Darinp

However, it seems that instead of creating a new window and main.xib file that contains the tabviewcontroller, it sets everything in code within the appDelegate.p  pits easy to work with the tabbarcontroller via code and i have no problems setting up other tab items, however, i feel that my iOS development skills they are new are missing something as i would NOT even know if it was still possible to work with the tabviewcontroller graphically now in the way this project template has been setup.p  pIs there a way to work with the tabviewcontroller graphically would i have to create a new main.xib file and link everything up to that im still not strong enough in my skills to work out all the minute details but if that is the path that people suggest, i will look into it and try to figure it out.p  pI only want to work this out so i can fully understand whats going on now with Xcode 4.2, I have no unrelenting desire to only work with the tab bar controller graphically, but am curios as to why i cannot find it or if i should... just trying to get my head around how these things should be working.p

Negative 9273 pI have an existing largeish PHP web app using Apache and MySQL which now needs to be able to call a Java based reporting engine.

Negative 9273 pIve seen many web apps that implement progress bars, however, my question is related to the nonuploading variety.p  pMany PHP web applications phpBB, Joomla, etc. implement a smart installer to not only guide you through the installation of the software, but also keep you informed of what its currently doing. For instance, if the installer was creating SQL tables or writing configuration files, it would report this without asking you to click. Basically, sitbackandrelax installation.p  pAnother good example is with Joomlas Akeeba Backup formerly Joomla Pack. When you perform a backup of your Joomla installation, it makes a full archive of the installation directory. This, however, takes a long time, and hence requires updates on the progress. However, the server itself has a limit on PHP script execution time, and so it seems that eitherp  ol liThe backup script is able to bypass it.li liSome temp data is stored so that the archive is appended to if archive appending is possible.li liClient scripts call the servers PHP every so often to perform actions.li ol  pMy general guess not specific to Akeeba is with 3, that isp  pre Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction1 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE SUCCESS Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction2 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE SUCCESS Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction3 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE SUCCESS Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction4 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE FAIL Reason Configuration.php not writable Web page JS  Show error to user pre  pIm 99 sure this isnt the case, since that would create a very nasty dependency on the user to have Javascript enabled. p  pI guess my question boils down to the followingp  ul liHow are long running PHP scripts on web servers, of course handled and are able to stay alive past the PHP maximum execution time If they dont cheat, how are they able to split the task up at hand I notice that Akeeba Backup does acknowledge the PHP maximum execution time limit, but I dont want to dig too deep to find such code.li liHow is the progress displayed via AJAXPHP Ive read that people use a file to indicate progress, but to me that seems dirty and puts a bit of strain on IO, especially for live servers with 10,000 visitors running the aforementioned script.li ul  pThe environment for this script is where safemode is enabled, and the limit is generally 30 seconds.

Negative 9273 pI am looking for the last record entered in each table of the database.  I know how to return the last record for each table one at a time.  However, I need to loop through all the tables about 10,000 and find the last record posted.  I can do this by scripting i.e. get all tables into an array and then doing a for each.  p  pIs there a way other than getting the last post from a table query and use a system table For example, I can use codeSELECT name FROM Sys.tablescode to get all the table names, put that into an array, and then a foreach loop to get the last message codeSELECT TOP 1 date FROM tableA ORDER BY date DESCcode.p  pI am hoping there is a field in a system table that holds when tables were last updated.

Negative 9273 pI have a service manager class used to abstract my calls from my MVC project to my REST service.  All the manager class does is set up the Rest calls using RestSharp and return the service data back to the MVC application.p  pSo, at first I thought about not testing such a trivial class, but have decided that tests will safeguard against future changes that might be more complex.p  pHowever, here is my dilemma. How far should I abstract things just so that I can test in isolationp  pSo, I am having my RestClient being injected by MVC into my manager class. I am letting the MVC injector set the base url. All of this I am ok with, but here are the questions I havep  ul liFor my method call, should I have my method take in a parameter userId and an IRestRequest ul liMy problem with this is that all of a sudden my generic servicemanager will become Rest specific as my interface would need to include both parameters.li ulli liIf I do not inject the IRestRequest into the method and let the implementation create it, is this ok since this will be ignored as the main method being tested is the RestClient.Execute, which will be stubbed out and not care about the actual RestRequest ul liIn fact, as this is part of the implementation, I could maybe mock and verify that the Execute method is being sent in the appropriate RestRequest objectli ulli liOr, should I not inject the IRestRequest, but instead inject an IRequestResolver into my constructor Then in my methodcall, I can just use the IRequestResolver, which will take in a string representing the method. This will then be used to figure out the RestRequest parameters and return an RestRequest object filled in appropriately for the methodli liOr, should I just essentially do the subbullet under my first bullet, and use the concrete implementation.li liAny other options I am missingli ul  pI am leaning towards the fourth bullet as it gets to the actual solution being testedp  pLet me know if you need any more details to help me resolve my dilemma.p

My contact service does not have update implemented yet, so updatedContact is actually the same one as original when you perform update all changes are ignored and old object is returned. So when I change i.e. PostCode in webpage from 555 to 666, updatedContact.PostCode is 555. I checked its value in debugger and also in view cshtml file where codeHtml.EditorFormgtm.PostCodecode is called, and everywhere it has old value not updated. The problem is that returned html catched from net in firebug and chrome dev tools hasp  precodeltinput classtextbox idPostCode namePostCode typetext value666gt codepre  pThis behavior is same for all properties, and as far as I know, there is no output caching and even if it were, it is a POST request so cache should be bypassed.

How is this possiblep  pThis bug now creates illusion that my update is working, and if it were working, I would probably not even know about it. This is potentially dangerous behavior because some properties can have value different from the one posted to controller, and user will not be able to see it after update, so I may have to refresh the whole page to workaround.p

Negative 9273 pstrongSummary of the questionstrongp  pI came to realise as I wrote this out that there is a lot of detail, so heres the headlinep  ul liWhat is a good workflow for a team of many users that use SVN and Git SVN within a work environment, but then also want to use a remote Git Repo BitBucket to access the same code from outside of the work environment, share changes to this code between each other while out of the office, and then safely rebasing back to SVN when back in the office While others are continuing to use Git SVN locally within the office tooli ul  pIn writing this, Ive also come to realise that what Im asking to do is really quite complex and may simply not be possible...p  pstrongThe Detailstrongp  pI work with a team of people using an SVN Repository. A number of us have started using Git SVN and are now reaping the benefits of using Git locally, branching at whim, merging into our local Masters as necessary and then dcommitting back to SVN. This works well although I realise we are not reaping all the benefits of a pure Git solution.p  pI have recently started using a private BitBucket Git Repository as a remote for the Master, so I can easily transfer code to and from other places. The workflow is thisp  ul liAt work, Rebase from SVN Trunk  Local Work Master.li liPush from Local Work Master  BitBucket Master.li liAt home, pull from BitBucket Master  Local Home Master.li liDo coding at home, branching, merging, enjoying git.li liMerge from local home branches  Local Home Master.li liPush from Local Home Master  BitBucket Master.li liAt work, pull from BitBucket Master to Local Work Master.li liRebase against SVN Trunk.li liDcommit to SVN.li ul  pOkay, there are a few steps but it works well for me. But, a number of my colleagues want to start doing the same sort of thing. What is more, we want to be able to use our BitBucket Git repo without the encumbrance SVN.p  pSome examples of the sorts of things we are consideringp  ul liIf one of us is out of the office, they want to be able to get the latest code. At work, I can rebase from SVN and then push to BitBucket, making the latest code available to my colleague.li liIf two of us want to share some changes assuming either one or both of us are out of the office, we can create a feature branch for this on BitBucket and each push and pull it as necessary.li liWhen were happy with it one of us can merge it into our Local Home Master and then push to BitBucket Master, ready for pulling when were back at work.li liOnce back at work one of us can pull Master from BitBucket to our Local Work Master, then then rebase against SVN and dcommit as usual.li ul  pBut, assuming one of us has done this, what then happens for the rest of the team If they pull from BitBucket Master, theyll get the changes. But, if they rebase from SVN, theyll get the changes too.p  pWhat happens if they do both And this is just one possible snag. I can think of other sets of steps were this could all get into a real mess.p  pUnfortunately our Continuous Integration workflow is tied to SVN, as is the rest of the business. Therefore we dont really have the option of moving to Git in its entirety. We also cant access our SVN repository from outside the company.p

Negative 9273 pWe are using DTOs as Data Contracts in our WCF web service. The purpose for these DTOs is to expose only the information that is relevant for a specific API method. p  pWhat I am seeking from you guys is some advise on the best practices here.p  pFor example, consider the following simple modelp  precodeclass Order      int CreatedBy  get set      DateTime CreatedOn  get set      string Description  get set      int Id  get set      string Name  get set   codepre  pAssuming our API allows a consumer to emCreateem, emUpdateem and emGetem an Order, we have created the following DTOs. DataMember and DataContract attributes are eliminated for simplicity.p  pemCreateem method A user cannot specify the emIdem and emCreatedOnem properties, so the DTO looks like thisp  precodeclass CreateOrderData      int CreatedBy  get set      string Description  get set      string Name  get set   codepre  pemUpdateem method A user cannot specify the emIdem, emCreatedOnem and emCreatedByem properties, so the DTO looks like thisp  precodeclass UpdateOrderData      string Description  get set      string Name  get set   codepre  pemGetem method A user should be able to see everything for the Order, so the DTO looks like thisp  precodeclass OrderData      int CreatedBy  get set      DateTime CreatedOn  get set      string Description  get set      int Id  get set      string Name  get set   codepre  pSo here are my questionsp  ul lipAssuming there are more properties in Order model and lot of those properties are shared between Create and Update DTOs, does it make sense to have these classes extend from a common base class If yes, should the Get DTO OrderData also extend from that class If we do that, doesnt it leave these DTOs too dependent on each otherpli lipIf all the properties are common between Create and Update DTOs, should we still create two different DTOs If yes, why If not, this is just a naming question now what should the CreateOrUpdate DTO be called so that the name is obviously different from the Get DTOpli lipIs it OK to suffix all the DTOs with something like Data or DataObject or Dtopli lipAre we on the right track here If not, how can be make this design betterpli ul  pUpdatep  pI think I dont like the inheritance in DTOs because the base class will also be exposed in the WSDL and the client will be able to see it and instantiate it which seems dirty to me see this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions658361wcfserializationwithobjectinheritanceWCF Serialization with object inheritancea. How about using Interfaces in DTOs to enforce common properties instead of inheritance Since DTOs should not have any behavior in them, we are not losing much by replacing inheritance.p

This way  JS plain text  php hash  databasep  pWhat about hash twice during Ajax  Do you think its good Like this  JS hash  php hash  databasep  pSo I dont care about hackers during Ajax request and of course another hash on the server will make it more secure and its one of the best hashing method I found. Using JS hashing I will never recive the real password on the server, but, I dont need the real password, just an hash to compare the passwords hashed.p  pBetter with JS hashing or I can go with just php hashp

Negative 9273 h1The questionh1  pI have a service that pushes content to users. To provide this content to their users, customers will include a script on their site. Their script sends a token to my server to identify which customer it is, but heres the problem if anyone copies the script from the users site, they can receive this live content, and the customer is billed for users that are not on their site. So, is there a way to ensure that the script is only included on their website How does google analytics achieve this p  pI have an idea, but I dont know if this would be completely secure.p  ol liThe customer tells me any domains including subdomains that they would like to include my script on.li liI give the user a very small text file that they store on their servers.li liOnce my script is loaded, it checks for window.location.host, and tries to fetch the text file from the root of the hosting domain.li liIf the file is found, and the contents match the content I generated when I gave the customer the file, I activate the service.li ol  pwould this workp  h1Why I can not use window.locationh1  pLets say that my script reads window.location, and sends that to the url codemydomain.comtokenABCamplocationhostgoodcustomer.comcodep  pNow, the owner of baduser.com wants to abuse the account of gooduser.com, so he includes gooduser.coms script. The script now sends an ajax request to codemydomain.comtokenABCamplocationhostbadcustomer.comcodep  pThis would not start the service, because badservice.com is not the domain that the owner of goodcustomer.com entered when he signed up. This is easy to circumvent, because badcustomer.coms owner can take a look at my script, notice that it is sending a request to validate the url, and just send his own request. So he would send a request to codemydomain.comtokenABCamplocationhostgoodcustomer.comcode. My server sees this request, compares the locationhost to the domain associated with the token, and starts giving the content meant for goodcustomer.coms users, to badcustomer.coms users. My server has no way of knowing wether the request was sent by my own script, or by a user trying to impersonate the actual customer.p

Negative 9273 pIm using AIR 2.0 soon will be updating to 3.3 with Flash CS6 to create an iPad app. We have textfields Classic, dynamic which sometimes contain one or multiple htmlText links which need to be clickable. In the desktop version of the program, all text is selectable and the links are easily accessed. My problem is that it takes me mashing the link like 20 times on the iPad before it will recognize that theres a link and navigate to it in Safari. The other strange thing is that none of the text appears to be selectable  I cant get the iPad cursor, copypaste menu, etc. to show up. p  pI think, from reading other threads, that the hit area for the URL is only the stroke on the text itself... if thats true, what can I do to increase the hit area Or make text selectable It was suggested elsewhere to put movieclips behind the URLs but thats not really possible as this is all dynamic text from XML files.p  pIve read about StageText but I gather this is only used for input fields, which is not the case here. p  pIm reasonably advanced in AS3 but Id prefer an easy solution over rewriting large chunks of code. At the moment the only thing I can think to do is get the URL and make it so that as soon as you touch anywhere on the textfield, it navigates to the link. But this would break down if there were more than 1 URL in a given textfield. p  pAny ideas p

If there is an exception thrown in LoadDriverToPLC then the sequence is resubscribed to and the body rerun and the user is asked to  press reset again.p  pThere is only one problem with this code. The first time through the MessageBox calls are correctly modal. This means they ride above the main window and you cant hide them by accidently clicking on the main window. However if an exception is thrown and the body is retried then the MessageBox calls are no longer modal.p  pIm sure this is to do with the RX schedular.

Negative 9273 pI am building a website that has 2 pages. A recipe list page, a recipe detail page, and a sign in page.

Negative 9273 pThis is probably a simple question, but Im stuck on it. Im trying to pass an object down from ObjectA to ObjectB which is a member of ObjectA via its constructor. However, instead of passing by value, I want to pass only a const reference and store that reference indefinitely. The problem is that Im not sure how to do it.p  pI can get this working emwith pointersem like thisp  precodeclass ClassB  private     int ptrInternalX public     ClassB int tempX    ClassBClassB int tempX       ptrInternalX  tempX  codepre  pThis way, an object is created and passed a pointer to an int, and that pointer is stored inside the class for later use.p  pHowever, pointers make me worry about memory leaks and other issues when using larger objects, so emId like to try to do something like this using constant referencesem const amp. However, this doesnt seem to work...p  precodeclass ClassB  private     int ampinternalX public     ClassB const int amptempX    ClassBClassB const int amptempX       internalX  tempX  codepre  pemI know that references are essentially an alias for an existing variable a different name that refers to the same memory address, and they need to be initialized immediately using an existing variable. So this creates an error in my programem p  pIs this even possible Or is there a bettermore clear way of doing something like this The reasons I want to use constant references are the speed of passing just a reference instead of a large object while keeping the data safe from accidental changes and memory leaks... Im sure that there is a simple and straightforward way to do this but Im not very familiar with const reference passing.p

Negative 9273 pIm working on a project in Eclipse that was cloned from a GIT remote repository. The Eclipse eGit plugin allows you to get going without really understanding anything about GIT, which is where I was. Ive eventually realized that when I do a compare with HEAD revision Im not as I first thought comparing with the remote repository, but with my local repository. I understand now that I need to pull updates from the remote repository, but its not clear what will happen to my local changes. Ive not committed these changes, partly because I thought I might be updating the remote repository I realize now that I wont but partly because I find the Package Explorer file decoration  is useful in identifying the files Ive modified. If I commit then I assume these indications will disappear.p  pMy questionsp  ol liHow do I update my local repository without losing my changesli liCan I do this without losing my modified file indicatorsli ol  pstrongUpdatestrong I thought I understood how some of this worked, but Im really lost now, particularly by the relationship between workspace and local repository.p  pI used TeamPull to update my repository. Since Ive not committed any changes, I expected this to work without conflict, but it flagged up all the changes between the workspace and repo as conflicts confusion 1.p  pI assumed I needed to use TeamSynchronize to bring changes into the workspace, as I would with other VCSs. When I do, I see the changes, but not even the nonconflict updates have been applied to the workspace and there is no Update operation to do this, so I dont know how to apply them confusion 2.p  pFor the conflicting updates, I manually merged the changes into the workspace copy and used Mark as merged, but this seems to do nothing. The conflict is not cleared. I would expect at this point the change would just be an uncommitted change in the workspace confusion 3.p  pI read elsewhere that to remove conflicts I should use TeamAdd and TeamCommit, but I dont want to commit my changes as I explained originally confusion 4.p  pYou can see Im confused Any help will be much appreciated.p

Negative 9273 pFirst I want to thank you for all your help on the page, its been really helpful. Now Ive come across a situation that I cant figure out, and I hope you can help me, this is itp  pAt my workplace I have access to an Oracle DB with a table filled with users on it names, lastname, birthdate and other stuff. It has 17 millions of records, and for each record I need to generate a unique key lets say its the 2 first letters of the name plus the birthdate concatenated, actually is more complex but its an example, so for this key I need to retrieve the record, calculate the key and then update the record with the key. Now over 17 million records its killing the serverp  pSo the DB at work is Oracle, I copied the data to my machine into a MYSQL database for testing. I was planning on testing locally making the calculations with php, and then create a java application to create the key on the server, but its a massive workload I dont know which way to go. The simple select takes 10 minutes on php on mysql via command line takes 1.49 minutes to COUNT the recordsp  pI know that its better to calculate the key as the records come in. They arrive in packages of 500k but since I just got here, the data is already merged and I have to work on these records.p  pSo what would you recommend this poor soul to do about such a task.

Negative 9273 pIm trying to migrate my current project from using regular CI query builder to use an ORM since my database is growing larger and i have more that 20 FK and relation between tables.p  pso im currently searching for a nice orm for CI. i found IgnitedRecord but i faced a huge problem.p  pexample modelsusers.phpp  precodeclass user extends IgnitedRecord   public function isloged return thisgtsessiongtuserdatauser  codepre  pProblem is that codethiscode is not pointing to CI anymore, and it return  codeUndefined property usersessioncode same with any CI classlibrary.p  pstrongso is there a way to fix that strong or do I need to use codeCI amp getinstancecode inside each i.r. model p  pAs strongmy models contain most of my app business logicstrong, I find it a bit uncomfortable to do codeCI amp getinstancecode in all my models , p  pother solution would be to move all logic into controller  OR trash this orm and stick with native query builder p.p  p SO next question When using orms I have never used one before between should I move my logic to controllers and only keep models for the orm  p  pthat will destroy my D.R.Y mana, because a lots of time I set propertiesmethods into a model and access them from viewsother controllers a feature that cannot be done inside controllers as I cannot reference a controller propertymethode from viewsother controller.p  pexample of problemp  precodeclass Auth extends CIController public msghello world  function index thisgtloadgtviewlogin     class user extends CIMODEL public msgHELLO FROM YOUR MODEL   VIEW  lt echo thisgtusergtmsgWORKS fine. echo thisgtauthgtmsgWILL NOT WORK. will throw an UNIDENTIFIED auth error gt codepre  pAlso way i designed my flow usually that controller start by loading all pluginseg modelsplugins.php  these plugins set some data properties for the main model to utilize, after loading all plugins controller loads the main model and excute its logic and send result back to view .p  pexample p  precodemodelspluginssettings.php     function config         thisgtmsg  hello         thisgtuser  sam         return       modelshello.php     function replacesam          newNONAME         ifthisgtsettingsgtusersam return thisgtsettingsgtmsg. .new         else return thisgtsettingsgtmsg. .thisgtsettingsgtuser       controllershome.php     function index         thisgtloadgtmodelpluginssettings         thisgtsettingsgtconfig          thisgtloadgtmodelhello             echo thisgthellogtreplacesam         echo hello NONAME      codepre  pwell i hope u got my point from this simple example.. so do you think i should rewrite every thing and move logic to controller p  pi appreciate your opinions. so if you think yes i should leave model for orm, then please explain to me how that would not be a huge waste p
Negative 9273 pInitially I followed the Portal example of Extjs.. a hrefhttpdocs.sencha.comextjs42extjsbuildexamplesportalportal.html relnofollowhttpdocs.sencha.comextjs42extjsbuildexamplesportalportal.htmla .. and managed to get it working with a tabpanel.. having portalpanel inside.. For this question, I refactored and removed most of the code because for some reason, the Tabpanel was getting constructed, but I couldnt see any TABS.. the Tabs were rendered too as I checked the existence of the tabs by setting the activeTab to 01,etc. I am using the Portal examples portal.js where the code you can see is a little different.. So essentially, if you download the code for portal example, you could simply replace this portion of the code and test it..  So, I was trying to get the TABS to show up.. and I managed to get my tabs in the center panel, but they arent at the bottom  top as they are supposed to be, but instead, it stretches to the screen, and its like a window thing.. p  pHeres the code  p  precodeExt.defineExt.app.Portal,       extend Ext.container.Viewport,      getTools function         return [             xtype tool,             type gear,             handler functione, target, panelHeader, tool                 var portlet  panelHeader.ownerCt                 portlet.setLoadingWorking...

Negative 9273 pI have a page that serves two purposes, mostly viewing an entry in the database, but some of the fields are displayed in textfieldstextareas because you can edit some values and then depending on the button you select at the bottom, you can update those entries.  I especially like the textarea because of its lookfeel, naturally resizeable in the page, and comes with standard rightclick options like SelectAll, etc. thx to browser support.  p  pAnyway, one of those fields shown in a textarea Id like to prevent from coming through upon postback because that value isnt going to be edited Ive even made it readonly so you cant even edit the textarea.p  pHow to accomplish preventing form postback for an input from the ASPX page  I know that is counterintuitive in general, but I thought perhaps theres a way similar to the Hidden inputs.  Also, I know that in the controller I could just wipe that field in the model before doing anything with the model submitted from the form, but Im curious if there is some option from the page that I could do.p  pIm using this syntax to define the textareabrp  precodelt Html.TextAreaFormodel gt model.Key, new  readonly  readonly, class  readonly, cols  62, rows  15 gt codepre  pbEDITbbr I probably should have noted that one of the main reasons I need to do this is because one of the model fields may contain some HTML in it.  This is an internal website and that field cannot be edited manually, so no one can input HTML, it is just a value in the database that comes from a license generation program.  And so, when I use a TextArea in a form that is bound to a model field, ASP.NET throws an exception upon binding the TextArea data back to the model to send upon postback.p  pI saw the SO answers using [AllowHtml] and [ValidateInputfalse] attributes, one wasnt available to me in MVC2 and the other requires downgrading the requestValidationMode, so I am looking for an alternative way to prevent the possible HTML value from being posted back at all but still displayed in a textarea.p

Negative 9273 pIm trying to do some domain driven design for the first time, and would be very happy for input on the following.p  pCurrently Im modeling a Student making a Reservation to attend a Course. Student and Course are entities and aggregate roots.p  pstrongMy first questionstrongbr Initially I thought of Reservation as an entity as well, since there are usecases where I want to query for Reservations independently of Students and Courses. However, to make the model simpler and avoid the bidirectional associations StudentltRegistration and CourseltRegistration Im thinking of making Reservation a value object instead. But does this make sensep  pConsidering the use case of viewing emallem Reservations for a particular day, I would need to load all Courses and retrieve their Reservations for inspection. This scenario will be uncommon in my system, but it still doesnt feel quite right. Any other ideas on how to get around this without making Reservation an entityp  pstrongSecond questionstrongbr Assuming I make Reservation a value object. I now want to implement a service for making registrations. Conceptually, it should do the followingp  ol liCreate a Reservation value object containing the id of the Student and the id of the Course.li liLoad the Course from the repository.li liAdd the Reservation to the Course.li liSave the Course to the repository.li ol  pLets say that the implementation of the repository uses a document database and handles conflicts using optimistic locking. Now assume that when the Course is saved to the repository, some other student made a reservation a fraction of a second earlier, so we get an OptimisticLockingException.p  pHow can I resolve this without pushing knowledge about the persistence mechanism to the domain layer Or the other way around. What I technically need to do is to basically try again reload the Course, add the Reservation again, and save it. But I simply cant figure out a way how to model this while keeping a clean separation of concerns between the domain model and the persistence layer.p  pAny help will be appreciated.p

The task calls a batch file which executes a gitpull command.p  pThis seems simple enough, but I use SSH keys to authenticate to the git server.  So far, the only method I have been able to figure out to pass these keys to git is to use codepageant.execode.

To work around this, I manually run the task, kill it, then let it run automatically afterward.  But, if pageant crashes or the server is rebooted, my files no longer synchronize on that server because of the firstline problem which could be a big problem in a roundrobin scenario.p  pAre there any suggestions as to how to improve this scheme  I cannot switch to httpsbased git.p  pNote also posted to a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions517370betteralternativetobatchfileforautomaticgitpullonwindowsserverServerFaulta.p

Negative 9273 pI have an issue in one of the legacy sitecore solutions, where an item node takes REALLY long time to load about 5 mins. This is obviously not a good thing, so I looked into how its setup. Its basically a dictionary item node, its setup something like this p  pre Sitecore   Content  Definitions   A   def 1   def 2   def 3   B   C   D  pre  pSo apparently they did try to make it so that the items were broken up into separate folders. Under each letter, there is about 200250 items. I can understand if the expand of each letter takes a long time, but in this case, the slowdown is when you click on Definitions. I can only assume it is trying to load all children and sub children. p  pIs there any way to stop this so that only one level is opened I can possibly try to group the subtree to be more granular and make a deeper tree, but Im thinking it wont help in this case, because Im not even trying to open an node that has too many items Definitions node only has 26 children  1 for each letter. p  pAfter the first load, the caching helps, but people are already ticked off at the first load. p  pAny ideas how I can improve the performance of this p
Negative 9273 pIm looking for some guidance on Architecture for an app Im building in Backbone.p  pIts basically a multipage App that calculates data based on an initial dataset. The Initial dataset is country specific and is getting pulled in from a JSON file.p  pWhen the app fires up, the dataset is used as the defaults in my main Backbone.Model. These defaults then have to be processedcalculated and set as additional model attributes. These attribute represent my app state. Some can be overridden from the UI. So to recap, Im using a singleton Backbone.Model to store the initial data, Im then building the rest of the data up on the Models initialize method.p  pI then recalculate the dataset attributes on model.change event. This fires the models custom method updateAttributes which recalculates data. It seems to me like its pretty inefficient because Im calculating the attributes, first in the initialize method, and again in the updateAttributes method.p  pAfter the values are all processed the data set is complete and can be applied to the app templates. The tricky part now is that some of the calculated data in the set are now editable from the UI. Once these default attributes are edited from the UI I dont want the updateAttributes method to recalculate their values because they are no longer default data, they are now userDefined data.p  pIm not quite sure where to go from this point, Im thinking of setting some attributes on the rapidly expanding model such as attributeNameSetFromUI true, and then having some if statements in the updateAttributes method that check for these and skip over that part of the calculation if the default isnt necessary.p  pIm not even sure if a large singleton Model is the way to go, it seems to work well enough.p  pIf anyone has some tips for this scenario that would be awesome. Im new to Backbone, finding it quite challengingp

Negative 9273 pTo begin I will explain my networking modelp  pNetworking in my game consists of pairing objects on the remote server and the client. To give a short description, say there are multiple characters in the server world that need to be synchronized with a client ill consider just one to simplify thingsp  pEach time a character on the serverside is created, the server will instantiate a ServerRpgCharacter  this class wraps the RpgCharacter and registers observers etc to monitor the character and broadcast relevant mutations to the character. The server then requests a pair object for ServerRpgCharacter that is, it requests the client to instantiate a pair for this object that will communicate with it. The pair can be any class, but any messages dispatched by ServerRpgCharacter on the remote end will be received by its respective pair on the client end.p  pIt gets a little more involved with multiple clients but it ends up working out nicely.p  pAnyway, I have been thinking of multiple ways to optimize this model. The way it works now is that when an object dispatches a message to its pair, it is queued up into a snapshot. Whenever any paired entity dispatches a messages it is thrown into the same snapshot. The snapshot is then compressed and dispatched at intervals of 200ms.p  pThe problem is that I am using the TCPIP protocol to transmit these snapshot. Im not sure exactly how the TCP protocol works, but I assume that if a snapshots packet is dropped, the entire snapshot would have to be resent.p  pThus I am wondering If it would be more optimal if I discarded TCP and instead implemented a custom layer overtop of UDP where instead of dispatching one whole snapshot for all messages sent by all pairs, I have it so that these individual pairs maintain their own packet ordering and buffering. This way, if a packet for pair A is dropped, pair B can ignore the fact that pair A had one if its packets dropped.p  pI then need to consider that compressing this data is less efficient since less is being transmitted.p

Negative 9273 pAccording to the standard Android documentation, the prefered way to start a service started service that is is to use an explicit intent like thisp  precode Using explicit intent Intent serviceIntent  new IntentgetApplicationContext, MyService.class  or Intent serviceIntent  new Intentthis, MyService.class startServiceserviceIntent codepre  pYou can also startstop a service using an implicit intent with an action string specified in the manifest, like thisp  precode Using implicit intent static final String serviceAction  com.example.my.app.services.MYSERVICE Intent serviceIntent  new IntentserviceAction startServiceserviceIntent   AndroidManifest.xml ltservice androidnamecom.example.my.app.services.MyService    androidexportedfalse androidprocessservices gt    ltintentfiltergt       lt StartStop service gt       ltaction androidnamecom.example.my.app.services.MYSERVICE gt    ltintentfiltergt ltservicegt codepre  pWhen the service is used only locally third party applications are not allowed to start or bind to it, the documentation says that you should not include an bintentfilterb in the manifest bserviceb tag and you should set the bexportedb tag to false.p  pNote the activities and services run in separate processes application and services processes. The communication between activity and service is done by implementing AIDL interfaces this is done because only AIDL remote interfacing allows me to do multithreading within the service that needs to handle IPC simultanously, not only between activities but mostly between services running within the services process.p  pMy questions arep  pQ1 When the activities and services I use in my app are run in two different processes, do I need to use implicit intents over explicit intents to start and stop the servicesp  pQ2 When the application process is gone destroyed, not in memory anymore and the services process is running in the background, how do I connect again from a new application process to the already running services process Somehow I need to get a reference to the services process again so that I can stop the running service inside that process. This cannot be done using AIDL afaik.p  pThe problem is that Android can and will destroy the application process easily when out of resources, and that is fine by me as long as the services process keeps running. Yes, I know about influencing the process by setting the service as a foreground service, etc. I too can read manuals   but that is not my problem. p  pI cannot find any information or answers related to my questions when the activities and services are in separated processes and use AIDL, AND when the application process needs to find the services process again after it has been killed by Android or when the user enters the app again after heshe left the app before.p  pAny expertlevel advise is welcome. p

Negative 9273 pI have a few URLs that I want to map to certain files via PHP. Currently, I am just using modrewrite in Apache. However, my application is getting too large for the rewriting to be done with regular expressions. So I created a file coderouter.phpcode that does the rewriting. I understand to do a redirect I could just send the codeLocationcode header. However, I dont always want to do a redirect. For example, I may want codeapiitemcode to map to the file codeherpderp.phpcode relative to the document root. I need to preserve the HTTP method as well. No problem, I thought. I made my code.htaccesscode have the following snippet.p  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteRule apiitem cgibinrouter.php [L] codepre  pAnd my coderouter.phpcode file looks as followsp  precodeltphp  uri  parseurlSERVER[REQUESTURI] query  isseturi[query]  uri[query]  array  some code that modifies the query requireonce SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT]herpderp.php . httpbuildqueryquery  gt codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work, because the OS is looking for a file named codederp.phpsomequerycode. How can I simulate a rewrite rule such as codeRewriteRule apiitem herpderp [L]code in PHP. In other words, how do I tell the server to process a different URL than requested and preserve the query and HTTP method without causing a redirectp  pNote Using variables set in coderouter.phpcode is less than desirable and is bad structure since its only supposed to be responsible for handling URLs. I am open to using a lightweight third party solution.p

Similarly, if the image is really long and thin, the image should fill the width of the parent, and maintain ratio, ideally collapsing the height of the parent to accommodate, or at the very least staying central to the div.p  pSo...What have I and many others triedp  pstrongAttempt 1strongp  pMake the code.childcode absolute and the code.parentcode relative such that the child can be tricked into a central position using codemarginautocode, while maintaining the correct height.p  precode.parent    position relative    width100   height80    backgroundcolorgreen    .child    positionabsolute    widthauto   height100    left0   right0   top0   bottom0    margin auto   codepre  pThis results in this for Chromep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJe2AX.png altattempt 1.1p  pSeems fine, but there are issuesp  ul liThe codemarginautocode trick doesnt work in IE7 or belowli liThe image only honours the codeheight100code CSS, so when the browser viewport is smaller in width, you get the followingli ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsrvTX.png altattempt 1.2p  pstrongAttempt 2strongp  pUse codemaxwidthcode and codemaxheightcode to make the image as widthyheighty as it can be.p  precode.parent    width100   height80    textaligncenter    backgroundcolorgreen    .child    maxheight100   maxwidth100   codepre  pThis results in this in Chromep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoI73C.png altattempt 2.1p  pAgain, this is fine. But there are some issuesp  ul liIE6 and below seem to make the image and the parent become slightly bigger than the code80code defined height. Presumably because they dont support the codemaxwidthcode and codemaxheightcode CSS propertiesli liWhen the browser viewport becomes narrower than the height of the image allows, it does resize, but the image is no longer centred, and the height of the parent remains code80code leaving our image to be rendered all alone at the top of the page. In a perfect world, the parent element would shrink in height to accommodate the nowsmaller image size. In a notsoperfect world, the image would at least be centred vertically within the parent.li ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5M4Iw.png altattempt 2.2p  pThese, so far, are the only partially acceptable solutions Ive found without using JavaScript.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pAre there any other pure CSSHTML solutions which circumvent the stated issuesp  pAm I asking too much of the box modelp

Negative 9273 pI have a special logging function, lets call it codeJLogcode which I have written to keep track of logging data, but only when testing in the simulator and on my test device. I set a DEBUG preprocessor flag in my Xcode project, set only for the development mode, not in production. codeJLogcode uses this to know whether to output the log message. It looks sort of like thisp  precodevoid JLogNSString message  ifdef DEBUG     NSLog, message endif  codepre  pI use this instead of wrapping all of my codeNSLogcode calls with codeifdef DEBUGcode  it makes my code easier to read and less prone to bugs.p  pThe problem is that even though the app doesnt print the log messages in production, it still needs to construct the messages which are passed to codeJLogcode  which are sometimes expensive and often uses a lot of memory. For example, if I have code like thisp  precodeNSError error  ltsomethinggt JLog[NSString stringWithFormatError , error codepre  p... then the app is forced to allocate an NSString, insert the NSStringified version of error into it, and pass it to codeJLogcode  only to do nothing with it. This seems very wasteful to me.p  pWhat Id like to do is, somehow, instruct Xcode to simply not compile the codeJLogcode code in production. That way, code such as the above example of constructing an error message which wont end up being printed to the log anyway, wont need to be called at all. How can I do thisp

Negative 9273 pI have a web frontend which uses data from a task that must be run frequently in bulk which takes more time than Id like to use PHP for. The data can be stored in a database so I was planning on writing a Java application to run the task and use the database as a middleman to get the results of this task accessible to the web. p  pProblem is, a preview of this data is needed occasionally. IE, sometimes the user needs to request a sample of the data which can be computed quickly to be generated on cue. p  pThis presents a real problem for me, this preview IS more suited for a language like PHP even though its essentially the same task. Its just two cases, in case A there are real jobs from many users to be done so the task takes a sufficiently long time to complete longer than a PHP request can hold, in case B its a baby job for just one user ran on the spot which could be completed in PHP without issue. p  pI dont want to write this code twice, it would make maintenance a nightmare so I kind of need to pick a language and stick with it. The frontend is designed but not implemented so I have an oppertunity to write the site in PHP, Ruby or Python if need be. I know PHP, so I would only consider switching to Python or Ruby if one of those languages offered a solution to this problem. but I know so little about these languages that I really cannot begin to know if they offer a solution without learning them which I dont have the time for atm. p  pIn short, is there a nonhackish way to write short, quick eventdriven code AND longrunning repetitive code with Ruby on Rails or Python If not do you have any ideas how to satifsy these two cases with either PHP or Javap

Negative 9273 pI am using a dict object to hold instance values in a class. I like having the dict because I often want to set or get a bunch of values at the same time and it is easy to pass a list or dict to accomplish this. For example to get several of the instance values I can just pass a [list of keys] and get back a dict of those keys values. As far as I can tell, doing that with separate attributes for each key requires jumping through a lot of code hoops if it is possible at all.p  pAnyway, Im looking for something like thisp  precodeclass SomeClassobject     def initself         self.desc               hair brown             eyes blue             height 1.55          codepre  pThis is all pretty simple up to here, but some of the values require special set conditions. My first attempt was something like thisp  precodeclass SomeClassobject     def initself         self.haircolor  blonde         self.eyecolor  green         self.desc               haircolor self.haircolor             eyecolor self.eyecolor             height 1.55               property     self.haircolorself         return self.haircolor      haircolor.setter     self.haircolorself, color         if color.lower in [blonde, brunette, brown, black, auburn, red]             self.haircolor  color         else raise ValueError       Same type of property construct for eyecolor codepre  pThis did not work. self.desc[haircolor] would initialize to blonde, but it had no dynamic tie to the property construct or the self.haircolor attribute. I tried replacing this with p  precodeclass SomeClassobject     def initself         self.haircolor  blonde         self.eyecolor  green         self.desc               haircolor propertyself.gethaircolor, self.sethaircolor             eyecolor propertyself.geteyecolor, self.seteyecolor             height 1.55               self.gethaircolorself         return self.haircolor      self.sethaircolorself, color         if color.lower in [blonde, brunette, brown, black, auburn, red]             self.haircolor  color         else raise ValueError codepre  pBut this failed in a different way.p  precodeprint self.desc[haircolor]  codepre  pWould return a strongstrstrong for the property object, and  p  precodeself.desc[haircolor]  brunette codepre  pdestroyed the property object and replaced it with the string.p  pI researched a few similar questions, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7760916correctuseageofgettersetterfordictionaryvaluesthis onea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3137685usingpythonspropertydecoratorondictsthis onea. p  pBoth of those cases operate at the dictionary level however. The problem there is that I need to know a lot about the dict when I am defining the custom dict class because I need to anticipate key names and switch them in strongsetitemstrong first example or the dictlevel property object second example. Ideally I would like to associate the setter with the value object itself so the dict does not need to be aware that there is something special about the values a key can reference.p

What I dont understand is, that the event is fired when I move the mouse from codecontentcode to codeoutercode codeinnercode just centers the actual content while codecontentcode is the sliding part and has the same width as codeinnercode. This is why I added the check if the relatedTarget is the element itself.p  pFor my understanding, there shouldnt be any mouseout events on the children. However, during good old alertdebugging it turned out that the event seems to fire if the mouse goes from codecontentcode back to codeoutercode, and of course, the codeisChildOfcode check failed for codeoutercode itself which is the relatedTarget.p  pI read about bubbling and capturing again, but I understand it that way, that it is only relevant if more than one eventhandler for a particular event is present.p  pI would appreciate any explanation or resource which helps understanding the reason for this.p

Negative 9273 pI have a question about a pseudocode algorithm analysis question which involves recursion.  p  pFor those that do not know, algorithm analysis generally refers to strongfinding the orderstrong of the amount of time it will take for the function to run.  So as an easy example, if a function has 2 nested while loops which run from 1 to n, the function will take roughly n2 time.  This is very useful in determining the estimated amount of time a program will take to run.   Hopefully that makes sense.p  pThis is an interesting problem involving recursion.  Lets begin with the codep  precodeFunc3A,n      ifn lt 10 then return A[1]     k  Randomn Random returns a number lt n     s  A[k] A constant time operation negligible amount of time     ifk is even then s  s  Func3A,n3 Referred to as R1 below.     ifk lt n2 then s  s  Func3A,n9 Referred to as R2 below.     returns  codepre  pThis is an interesting problem because you have to think carefully about the possibilities for k and the fact that k is randomly selected.  p  pLets take n  100.  Then, what is the worst possible value for k worst meaning the value which causes the program to run for the longest amount of time  One may initially think that k100 will be the worst value, because it will cause both recursions to run the most amount of times due to the small amount for n of n3 being called from R1.   R1 will be hit with n97, and now there are further possibilities for either R1 or R2 to be hit in the ensuing recursion keep in mind k is selected randomly EACH time the program runs.  It is likely that at least one of them will be hit at each level of the ensuing massive recursive loop, if not both at each level of the loop.p  pstrongButstrong, this will only cause one of the recursions to run, with the other being neglected.  Perhaps the other worst case scenario is that k  50, which is exactly half of n, emandem is an even number.  Then, both of R1 and R2 are hit on the first run through.  Not only does this take twice the amount of time right off the bat, but now both recursions are running and thus there is twice the likelihood of hitting further recursions in the ensuing loops.  For example again take n  100, and k  50.  Then both R1 and R2 are hit with n97 and n91, respectively.  Now, however, we have 2 recursive loops going and thus there is twice the likelihood of further recursive calls being hit think what would happen if for the random selection, K1  97, and K2  40 in those R1R2 recursive calls called from the original run thru.p  pWhat is the worst case scenario for the timing here  What is the emestimatedem using probability ie. chances of R1  12 while chances of R2  12 asymptotic running timep

Negative 9273 pI am working on a large scale project that involves giving a python script a first name and getting back a result as to what kind of gender it belongs to. My current program is written in Java and using Jython to interact with a Python script called sex machine. It works great in most cases and Ive tested it with smaller groups of users. However, when I attempt to test it with a large group of users the program gets about halfway in and then gives me the following errorp  precodeException in thread main SyntaxError No viable alternative to input n, ltstringgt, 1, 22, result  d.getgenderChristinewazonekn codepre  pI am more accustomed to Java and have limited knowledge of Python so at the moment I dont know how to solve this problem. I tried to trim the string that Im giving the getgender method but that didnt help any. I am not sure what the numbers 1, 22 even mean.p  pLike I said since Im using Jython my code would be the followingp  precodestatic PythonInterpreter interp  new PythonInterpreter   interp.execimport sys, os.path interp.execsys.path.appendUsersmynameDesktop interp.execimport sexmachine.detector as gender  interp.execd  gender.Detector  interp.execresult  d.getgenderWordUtils.capitalizename.trim               PyObject gendAnswer  interp.getresult codepre  pAnd this is pretty much the extent of JythonPython interaction in my Java code. If someone sees something thats wrong or not right I would certainly appreciate if you could help me. As this is a large project it takes time to run the whole program again only to run into the same issue, so because of this I really need to fix this problem.p

Negative 9273 pIn this question I have two doubts. Firstly I have two string variables named strongbiddatestrong and strongplaceddatestrong respectively which contains date and time in string format.The strongvalue in biddate is in this format 17Feb14 125400 PMstrong and the strongvalue in placeddate is also in this format  15Feb14 95538 PMstrong. I need to convert both the strings biddate and placeddate to the date and time format as given. But I dont know how to do this. p  pSecondly I need to create a timer in my activity using these two values biddate and placeddate. As it can be seen that biddate value is always higher than product date value, so I need a timer which counts down from biddate to placeddate each second by second.  So the difference between biddate and placeddate should be displayed as strongxx days xx hours xx minutesstrong remaining, when I start my activity. When the biddate and placeddate difference becomes less than 1 day, the timer should display as strongxx hours xx minutesstrong remaining. When the biddate becomes equal to placeddate, it should display as some message in my activity as bidding ended or somewhat message like that.p  pIm a newbie in this android world.

Negative 9273 pAs part of my university curriculum I ended up with a real project which consists in helping a company shifting from their relational data warehouse into a NoSQL data warehouse. The thing is that what they are looking for is better performance in large jobs but so far they have used a single machine and if they indeed migrate to NoSQL they still wish to keep using a single machine for cost reasons.p  pAs far as I know the whole point of NoSQL is to run it in a large distributed system of several machines. So I dont see the point of this migration, specially since I am pretty sure but not entirely that if they do install NoSQL, they will probably end having even worst performance.p  pBut still I am not comfortable telling them this since I am still new to this area less than a month, so I wonder, is there are any situation where using NoSQL in a single machine for a datawarehouse would be justifiable performance wise Or is it just a plain bad ideap

Negative 9273 pI want to improve my experience with the internet by caching static content like imagesjpg,png,gif and fonts. Because always happens that when watching a webpage with a lot of images, and then I refresh with F5, the same contents are downloaded again.p  pI know that its because the response headers could contain no cache o maxage 0, and even sometimes it happens when there is no cache o maxage in the response.p  pBut in case of images or fonts that never change, its useless to get maxage 0. So I wanted to know if there is a way to override the response headers and set them with maxage 1 year. Maybe with a chrome extensionp

Negative 9273 pI have validation repporting errors for nodes violating restrictions as defined in the xsdschema, which works great.

If I actually use a static variable to store the value, it ends up being shared across multiple calls to the service, which is not the behavior that I am after.  The same thing happened when I stored the value in AppDomain.  My service is defined as PerCall and is hosted in IIS, if that makes any difference to the solution.  Thank you.p
Negative 9273 pIm working on a project that uses a lot of templates and libraries like boost fusion and found myself struggling with an executable that, as of today, is 600MB and gdb needs 1.7 GB of memory to just load it, and a symbol lookup would make it use nearly 3GBs.. The stripped binary is about 5 MBs. p  pThe question is, is there anything to be done in order to generate smaller debug symbols This is not only a problem with gdb but also with the linker, which uses another 1.2 GB of RAM when linking objects compiled with the g flagp  pIve tried g1 g2 and g3 and the problem remains the same.p

Negative 9273 pI thought I can use the string representation of a keyboard key to configure shortcuts, i.e. let somebody define a keystroke in a resource bundle and pass that value directly to codejavax.swing.KeyStroke.getKeyStrokeStringcode. But this does not work for international keyboards, e.g. arabic. There the keyboard keys are only high level key typed events, but shortcuts need to be defined as low level key pressed events with their key code representation. If one knows the according key code one can use the english representation of that key to get it working, but where should one know this from I wrote a key listener that tells that, but I need something while parsing a codeStringcode programmatically. Any ideas to use the natural language dependent key representation for shortcutsp  precodeimport java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.KeyAdapter import java.awt.event.KeyEvent  import javax.swing.AbstractAction import javax.swing.JComponent import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.KeyStroke import javax.swing.SwingUtilities   public class InternationalKeyStroke       public static void mainString[] args          SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable               public void run                  JFrame frame  new JFrame                 frame.setPreferredSizenew Dimension600, 400                 frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE                 JPanel panel  new JPanel                 final JLabel label  new JLabelType the key you want to know the key code of                 panel.addlabel                 frame.addKeyListenernew KeyAdapter                       Override                     public void keyPressedKeyEvent e                          String text  Key   e.getKeyChar   needs to be configured with char   char e.getKeyCode                           label.setTexttext                         System.out.printlntext                                                        frame.getContentPane.addpanel                 frame.pack                 frame.setVisibletrue                  KeyStroke working  KeyStroke.getKeyStrokecontrol typed A                 label.registerKeyboardActionnew AbstractAction                       Override                     public void actionPerformedActionEvent event                          System.out.printlnWorking action   event                                      , working, JComponent.WHENINFOCUSEDWINDOW                  KeyStroke target  KeyStroke.getKeyStrokecontrol typed                  System.out.printlntarget                 label.registerKeyboardActionnew AbstractAction                       Override                     public void actionPerformedActionEvent event                          System.out.printlnNot working Action   event                                      , target, JComponent.WHENINFOCUSEDWINDOW                             codepre

Negative 9273 pI have template database in codeassetscode directory. This database has to be copied to the main apps database which resides in the private storage area. p  pNow, all samples Ive seen on the Internet seem very odd to me.

I hope to gather responses from all of you on the dos and donts so that it will come in useful to CKAN publishers and developers in future. p  pFor example, data has to be in a tabular format with labelled rows and columns.

Negative 9273 pI want you people to comment on everything I write, because I want to know whether Im on right track. So, here it is.  p  ol liWould you say that using multiple managed object contexts was the right way when you had app with multiple view controllers that did different tasks I figured out that having singleton context and child context in view controllers can solve the problem when you want to save just part of context, i.e. creating small, local context and push everything on main context before saving it to store. strongFor example, I created some object using one VC which is part of context now, but I didnt press save new object. But then, with new object, I went to other VC and saved something else. The problem is that being part of same context, you save whole state of context. It seems in this situation that I have to separate contexts.strongli liI thought using context hierarchy would propagate changes made on one context to parent and then other child would see edited data when fetching again, but this is not the case. If I want to see the changes, I have to use coderefreshObjectmergeChangescode with codeYEScode as a parameter. Plus, I have to fetch again to check for new records. Is there a better solution strongFor example, I loaded VC according to my settings, went to other VC, changed settings and saved it. Now when I get back, I want in viewWillAppear to get changes and change GUI according to changes made in settings. But, the problem is that when I fetch settings, I get same data, I presume because of caching But whats the point for parent context then in this scenariostrongli liSo, is there really need for multiple contexts if you have to fetch and refresh all the time strongSimilar to above, why linking context if they dont propagate changesstrongli liReseting context  When is good time to reset context If I use singleton context, everything is being stored in it, so after some time, it might use a lot of memory, right So, from this point of view, do I really want to use singleton with contextstrongFor example, I have a list of objects I present in some tableView. Since in hierarchy I hold it all the time because its part of navigation stack, should I hold all of the objects all the time, or dispose them and get them again when I get to that VC I mean, I cant do a lot with objects if they belong to different contexts. Id have to get objects by their IDs to use them with context which is not connected, rightstrongli ol

Negative 9273 pI have a method I want to test that is being called with a particular object. However, identifying this object is somewhat complex because Im not interested in a particular instance of the object, but one that conforms to certain conditions.p  pFor example, my code might be likep  precodesomecomplexobject  ComplexObject.generateparams myfunctionsomecomplexobject codepre  pAnd in my test I want to check thatp  precodetestcomplexobject  ComplexObject.generatetestparams subject.shouldreceivemyfunction.withtestcomplexobject codepre  pBut I definitely know that codeComplexObjectcode will return codefalsecode when comparing codesomecomplexobjectcode and codetestcomplexobjectcode because that is desired behavior elsewhere I rely on standard codecode behavior and so dont want to overload it for codeComplexObjectcode.p  pI would argue that its a problem that I find myself needing to write a test such as this, and would prefer to restructure the code so that I dont need to write such a test, but thats unfortunately a much larger task that would require rewriting a lot of existing code and so is a longer term fix that I want to get to but cant do right now within time constraints.p  pIs there a way with Rspec to be able to do a more complex comparison between arguments in a test Ideally Id like something where I could use a block so I can write arbitrary comparison code.p

Negative 9273 pI searched around and found pieces of what I want to do and how to do it but I have a feeling combining them all is a process I shouldnt do and that I should write it a different way.p  pCurrently I had a small application that would use a MSSQL library in Node to Query a SQL Server with a sql command and get the results and store it as an object. Which then I use express and some javascript to decipher it or modify it before calling it with an AJAX call and responding it as a proper JSON object.p  pSQLDB  NodeJs  API  localhostp  pMy problem now is I want to repurpose this and expand it. Currently storing the SQLDB responses as objects inside an array is becoming a huge memory problem. Considering some of these requests can be hundred thousands of rows with hundreds of columns, the node process begins eatingup outrageous amounts of RAM.p  pI then thought, maybe I could easily just take that object when it comes through in the result and write it to file. Then when ajax calls come to expressjs, it can read from the file and res.json from there.p  pWill this work if say 50200 some people request data at the same time Or should I look for another methodp

Negative 9273 pBehaviors are ubiquitously defined as timevarying valuessup1sup.p  pWhy time being the dependencyparameter for varying values is very uncommon.p  pMy intuition for FRP would be to have behaviors as eventvarying values instead it is much more common, much more simple, I wage a much more of an efficient idea, and extensible enough to support time too tick event.p  pFor instance, if you write a counter, you dont care about timeassociated timestamps, you just care about the Increasebutton clicked and Decreasebutton clicked events.br  If you write a game and want a positionforce behavior, you just care about the WASDarrow keys held events, etc. unless you ban your players for moving to the left in the afternoon how iniquitous.p  pSo Why time is a consideration at all why timestamps why are some libraries e.g. codereactivebananacode, codereactivecode take it up to the extent of having codeFuturecode, codeMomentcode values Why work with eventstreams instead of just responding to an event occurrence All of this just seems to overcomplicate a simple idea eventvaryingeventdriven value whats the gain what problem are we solving here Id love to also get a concrete example along with a wonderful explanation, if possible.p  psup1sup Behaviors have been defined so a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiFunctionalReactiveProgrammingherea, a hrefhttpblog.reactiveprogramming.orgp21herea, a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagereactive0.11.5docsFRPReactiveBehavior.htmlherea... amp pretty much everywhere Ive encountered.p

Negative 9273 pWere creating a desktop MVVM application using Prism and Ninject. This application will feature sessions during which data should be recorded under a specific session. Our Views and ViewModels are created by an IoC container by Prism. I would like to start and stop sessions, but I have no idea how to handle scoping for parts such as the DAL of a desktop application.p  pAm I thinking in the right direction or should I be thinking about it differently I guess I could pass through a session ID through navigation parameters in Prism or broadcast session events using the PubSubEvents messagebus, but that just seems wrong.p

Negative 9273 pI have been struggling with setting up Carrot2 for use PHP, on a local machine. The plan is to have Carrot2 retrieve cluster from Solr populated by Nutch. Currently  Solr and Nutch are correctly configured and I have been able to access the information via Carrot2 Workbench.

Tomcat is set up on port 8080. The Carrot2 DCS php example example.php works and displays the test output correctly. Although, when I try to perform a cluster using localIPAddress8080carrot2dcsindex.html I run into a problem. When I set document source to Solr and the query to emem then click cluster  I get the following error message. p  ppre HTTP Status 500  Could not perform processing org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException Connection to localhost8983 refusedp  ptype Status reportp  pmessage Could not perform processing org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException Connection to localhost8983 refusedp  pdescription The server encountered an internal error that prevented it from fulfilling this request. prep  pI have searched everywhere in the deployed webapp folder for carrot2 and cant find where it is getting localhost8983 from.p  pAny assistance would be appreciated, thank you.p

Negative 9273 pMy problem is that I cant get the ol element to scroll on hover without the image on the right also scrolling. I know its probably something simple. I just dont know what it is.p  pIve been working on this for quite a bit of time and cant seem to figure this out.

So, the structure needs to stay intact.p  pAt the current point, I have gotten the list to scroll as I hover on each end of the list. However, the main image is also scrolling which doesnt need to happen.

So if someone only changes one field in the view model, Id like to update only this column in the database.p  pCurrently I post the view model back to a controller, validate, and then automap to the Entity Framework class.p  pAs a proper example, lets say my view model is as followsp  precodepublic class MyViewModel      public int Id  get set      public int Num1  get set      public int Num2  get set   codepre  pThere is only 1 row in the database as followsp  precodeId  1 Num1  10 Num2  20 codepre  pThis then gets read into the view model when the page is loaded.p  pIf person A and Person B both use the website to browse to this record at the same time, they will both have 10 and 20 for Num1 and Num2 respectively on their screen.p  pPerson A sets Num1 to 15 and presses save.p  pPerson B then changes Num2 to 25 and presses save. However Person As change of Num1  15 gets lost and overwritten by 10 from Person Bs record, since the whole view model gets saved.p  pDoes anyone have any web frameworks they can recommend which plan nicely with MVC which will avoid this issuep

Negative 9273 pOur company designs museum and visitor center exhibitory, and my main job is designing touch screen kiosk applications. Enamored by a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvaGvFbBtLNA relnofollowVidyas introduction to Kiosk Apps using Chrome boxesa, I quickly had my boss procure one for testing. I have since gained a firm grasp of Chrome App structure going though Googles tutorials manifest files, MVC, etc and have found the performance of our little HP Chromebox plus HTML5 development to be pretty impressive. Im developing on my Macbook using Chrome Canary to run and test the apps.p  pIm adding in this background information so you can better understand my goals. We of coarse need these apps to launch full screen upon power up. No login or user installation is desired. I prepare the boxes in my office, install them at the exhibit, the end. strongWe certainly dont want our multimedia apps to be sitting up on the Chrome Web Store for others to download and install.strongp  pSo, Ive gotten to the point where I want to install a simple kiosk app on our HP Chromebox. Unfortunately Vidya did not go into detail on this part. The page from a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comappsmanifestkioskenabled relnofollowher articlea only touches upon adding codekioskenabled  truecode to the manifest file.p  pSo heres what Ive tried so far Ive moved my app folder onto an SD card and moved it from there onto our HP Chromebox into the Downloads folder apparently the only folder. I sign into Chrome Browser on the box with my company account strongdo I have to do thisstrong and load up chromeextensions. I click load unpacked extension... and select my app folder. The app installs and I am able to manually launch it by clicking Launch. Next, I click the Manage kiosk applications... button and enter the app ID into the field. This is where I get stuck. strongClicking Add produces an Invalid Application error.strongp  pLooking around the web I have found lots of confusing informationp  ul liI must Wipe the Chromebox in order to use a ctrlaltK key command to truly enable kiosk mode. Googles instructions on how to do this stops with Samsung and Asus boxes, I have an HP, not to mention the Manage Kiosk Applications button is already visible to me.li liI must upload my App to the Webstore as either public or unlisted, and then download and install it onto my Chromebox. Really I dont want to sell my app or make it available to anyone. It is only meant to run in our exhibit. Our apps could be gigs of data with HD videosli liI must make my Chromebox Managed or Enterprise or Enroll it for Work and Education Administration. In most cases, well be installing one or two of the boxes to allow users to navigate though static HTML pages. I dont have a need to manage a fleet remotely at least not yet. So, the aforementioned complications seem unnecessary, and expensive if I understand things correctly.li ul  pCan someone point me to the definitive process for achieving my goal of an auto starting, full screen kiosk application on my Chromeboxp  pThank you.

Negative 9273 pWe have one of those scenarios where you prefer an event to be triggered only when you leave the input field. That is because the event leads to a postback like ajax request which in turn updates the input fields. A change event would start an infinite loop.p  pOn the other end, a blur event is triggered each time the user leaves the field regardless whether the field was changed or not.p  pWhat I am looking for is kind of a changeandthenblur event which fires emifem the field changed but only emwhenem it is left blurred.p  pI reckon jQuery does not have that out of the box. Is there any easy way to extend it for thatp  pstrongUpdate  I have just tried hard to reproduce the issue of the infinite loop in a simple jsfiddle  to no avail.strongp  pThere is knockout involved as well as jQuery autoNumeric and a custom autoNumeric knockout binding. The values are updated using ko.mapping. But even when including all of those my jsfiddle seems to work perfectly with the simple jQuery codechangecode event a hrefhttpjsfiddle.neta1tbxnpp relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.neta1tbxnppap  pSo I guess I will rather investigate the issue with my application that bother introducing another jQuery event.p

Negative 9273 pI have two servlets that access and manipulate a list of shared objects, access via a singleton class.  Servlet1 is loaded by ClassLoader1 and Servlet2 is loaded by ClassLoader2.  When I try to cast objects from the common list, I get a ClassCastException.  So I serialize and deserialize each object before use and that solved the problem.  But I read that serializationdeserialization have huge performance impact.  So I am wondering if there is a better way to handle this  Note that I have no control over which classloader the servlets use initially.p  pThe servlets are from a web application not mine off a websphere server.  Each time a new servlet is executed, the web application creates a new classloader for it.  Again I have no code level access to this web application.p

Neither I am able to use the codeHttpClientcodeClass because I have to provide support for .NET Framework 4, nor I can chunk the upload because the targetservers do not support that kind of upload. I think the memory problem is caused because the data I already sent while uploading is still allocated in the RAM.

Negative 9273 pSo I was reading over the Python DocumentationTutorial, specifically I was looking at the InputOutput with files.

This is my codep  precodef  opentest.txt  f.readlines codepre  pUnless I use the variables and a codeprintcode, the program will not return anything thats in the file. Heres my files contentsp  precodeHello This Is Test For Loops In Files Flying Away A Bird also Flies Wow codepre  pAny ideas as to why this isnt working I think its my interpreter, as I am using SublimeREPL, but it hasnt been doing anything weird before then so I am not too sure. Also, when I try running it in my Python console, it gives me an error, then just closes the console so I cant even see the error. Pretty counterproductive.p  pEDIT Just to clarify, my issue is not the codeforcode loop, the codeforcode loop already worked fine from before. The issue is that codef.readlinescode does not return any lines, even though the documentation says it should return the next line. I will take the codeforcode loop out of my code to clarify. Also, sorry if I am mixing up codef.readlinecode and codef.readlinescode, but they both dont work, anyway. Thanks,p  ul liSaidli ul  pANSWER For anyone who ever encounters this issue, or is just curious, the issue was that when scripting I had to use codeprintcode, but in a command prompt, I can just use codef.readlinescode and it will read the lines.

Negative 9273 pI have a MySQL DB table with about 100k  200k rows. The table rows are created, updated, deleted frequently every 510 seconds. Currently a single JVM app instance reads all the rows and processes all the entities in the table which are found to be in a specific state. The processing task is scheduled every 12 minutes and processing itself takes about 12 minutes. Now I want to make this JVM app a clustered fault tolerant service. One option is to have multiple instances acquire a distributed Hazelcast lock, and whichever instance acquires the lock processes the entities. However ideally I would want all the JVM instances partaking in the service to be processing some of the rows but at the same time ensure that each row is processed at least once in a given 5 minute interval. p  pIs there a way I can use Hazelcast to shard the responsibility for a subset of table rows among multiple node instances p  pPS  Replacing MySQL is not an option, open source alternatives to Hazelcast are an option.p

Negative 9273 pI have a View Controller, called Chat View Controller, thats organised in Storyboard as follows img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIUW6q.png altChat View Controller Storyboard Layoutp  pThis is accessed with a navigation controller. Basically what this View Controller is is a view similar to that of Apples Messages app. The View that you can see outside the Chat View Controller at the bottom is the view that Im trying to add as an Input Accessory View, and is called messagingView.

Negative 9273 pIve searched Google and the Internet for information on how to do this but I cant find anything.p  pDoes anybody know if its possible to launch Google Now on a button click in my Android App p  pI know how to launch a normal application by using the package manager but I cant seem to figure out how to launch this.p
Negative 9273 pSo ES 6 is bringing us a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsMap relnofollowMapsa and none too soon. Wishing to subclass Map for my own nefarious purposes, I tried the following abbreviated for clarityp  precodefunction Foo      return Map.applythis, [].slice.callarguments   var bar  new Foo codepre  pIn V8 environments this throws an Error Map constructor not called with new. Why SpiderMonkey gets this rightp  precodeMap.call, [[foo, bar]].getfoo codepre  pwill, as expected, yield bar. In both SpiderMonkey and V8 attempting something likep  precodefunction Foo  Foo.prototype  new Map var bar  new Foo bar.setfoo, bar codepre  pwill fail method set called on incompatible object. So there goes that inheritance pattern. As far as I can tell from the a hrefhttppeople.mozilla.orgjorendorffes6draft.htmlsecmap.prototype.has relnofollowspeca I dont have much specfoo, actual Map objects have internal properties that are not accessible that are required for them to work properly. But why does V8 throw an error on the first pattern This seems like an odd decision, especially when it works as expected in FF.p  pUPDATE I noticed that FF and chrome both have codeObject.setPrototypeOfcode implemented. Just in case anyone stumbles across this and thinks of that, I can tell you it fails. Both of the following fail for different reasonsp  precodethis totally fails, even for custom constructorsobjects var Foo  function Object.setPrototypeOfFoo, Map.prototype var bar  new Foo bar doesnt have any of the Map propertiesmethods  this one has the methods but still throws the incompatible object err. Also fails with new Map instead of Map.prototype var bar  Object.setPrototypeOf, Map.prototype  codepre  h3TLDRh3  pThere are basically four ways to extend map some from answerscomments belowp  ol liAdd methods to Map.prototype shame on you.li liFactoryconstructor makes objects with an internal Map instance that you delegate toli liMixin fn that copies properties onto Mapsliol  precodefunction Foothis.bar  boo var baz  new Map Foo.callbaz baz.bar yields boo baz.set5, 5.get5 yields 5 codepre  pOr just wait for ES 6 classes to hit the platforms you care aboutp

Negative 9273 pI need the following setup  p  pIssue a system call from the user application running inside the vm launched using qemu.There are two parameters to this system call virtual address of a variable, its size.The parameters gets passed in ebx and ecx respectively inside the guest as normal to the kernel.

On receiving this instruction, the qemu gets diassembles it and just does some printfs to test out the hex code of new instruction workingor not.p  pI have these questionsp  ol lipWhen I try to see the contents of registers from outside the guests, for example envregs[REBX], I am still able to see the virtual address that test program passed. According to my understanding, I thought qemu only sees the corresponding physical address from outside and has no visibility of virtual address from outside since its dependent on os running inside the image.pli lipI wanted to know how could I get these arguments that I have given through the testapp to be received by qemu code.

Negative 9273 pI am trying to derive an algorithm that will allow me to calculate the angular displacement in circular motion. This is a physical device that I am programming so I do have feedback of the current angular position from 0  2pi.I have attached a photo that will help you see what I am trying to achieve see below. Each time the processor scans through the program updates the tags and then calculates the delta theta by taking Theta2Theta1 and then stores it into the DeltaTheta tag. The problem is that when I complete a revolution, Theta 2 becomes 0 and Theta 1 is still something like 3pi2 or so and thus I get a larger Delta Theta than I should. Each time the angle hits the 2 pi mark, it resets to zero. I am using this program to implement an algorithm with Fourier Analysis on a Rockwell CompactLogix PLC. For those of you concerned enough I am programming in RSLogix5000 using the Structured Text language.

Negative 9273 pI was playing with an idea that I yet havent had time to test myself and therefore wanted to bring it up here with a few initial questions.p  pLets say we have a very large table in Azure Table Storage that is altered very rarely, but its still so large that Azure Table Storage is the right fit for storing the data.p  pOne of missing features on table storage is that there is no paging and you have to do range queries. p  pWhen iterating all rows in the table using the next tokens. Is these next tokens persistence over time when the table do not change such I could create a paging table with all next tokensp  pMy understanding is that a next token is just a rowpartitionkey starting point in the table.p  pHaving the paging table could provide a meaning of looking up data in fixed ranges. p

The Windows 10 allinone had an error in event viewer from KernelBase.dll when I tried to connect from the desktop but with the Windows 7 Desktop as server and laptop as client it doesnt show the error on the desktop or laptop.

Negative 9273 pI am working on a little crossplatform python project. I want to associate file extensions with the program, so for OSX it seems the script must become an Application. py2app seems like the perfect tool for the job, but I am having a lot of trouble finding good documentation on it.p  pMy python script relies on a package I wrote codek.tkcode and symlinked to codeLibraryPython2.7sitepackagesktkcode the individual files are symlinked into the folder  the folder is not a symlink.p  pThis is the setup.py script I am usingp  precode This is a setup.py script generated by py2applet  Usage     python setup.py py2app   from setuptools import setup import sys  APP  [randomizer.py] DATAFILES  [] OPTIONS  argvemulation True, includes [k.tk]  setup     appAPP,     datafilesDATAFILES,     optionspy2app OPTIONS,     setuprequires[py2app]  codepre  pI am having two problems with my setup, both of which I have found a really ugly workaround for that I do not like. p  pstrongFirst Problem  Aliased Buildstrongp  pThe first problem occurs when building with codepython setup.py py2app Acode. This is supposed to build the application with links to the source files to make development easier. When I try to run the resulting application, however, it saysp  blockquote   pImport Error No module named k.tkp blockquote  pThe workaround for this is to append these lines to the python scriptp  precodeimport sys sys.path.appendLibraryPython2.7sitepackages codepre  pIt seems like this implies that something is wrong with the python environment when the it is called from the application, but I dont know enough about py2app to know how to fix it.p  pstrongSecond Problem  Full Buildstrongp  pThe second problem occurs when building with codepython setup.py py2appcode. This triggers a regular build and copies all libraries into the application. When I run this application, I getp  blockquote   pOSError [Errno 20] Not a directory [path snipped]application.appContentsResourceslibpython2.7sitepackages.zipkp blockquote  pThe ugly workaround here was to open the applications files and extract sitepackages.zip, into a folder called sitepackages.zip. Now the path given in the error message is a directory, and the application runs fine.p  pDoes anyone know how to fix this I am feeling pretty stumped, and the only documentation I can find is a hrefhttppythonhosted.orgpy2app relnofollowthisa, which seems extremely limited.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI tried copying codeLibraryPython2.7sitepackageskcode directory into the project directory. This fixed the Aliased Build, but unfortunately not the Full Build. p  pI also tried following the instructions in the Python Documentation a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2distutilsindex.html relnofollowherea to properly package and install. This had the same effect. I am feeling quite frustrated why would it be trying to look in a zip file as if it were a folderp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI ended up writing a build script that just overwrites the zip with a directory with the same name. This solves the problem, but I am not happy with the solution.p  pI also have moved on to trying to build for Windows with py2exe. In Windows, I experience the exact same problem This time library.zip is created and must be extracted for the program to run. Surely these programs do not just happen to have the same exact bug, but I cannot imagine why they both would incorrectly expect a zip file to be accessible the same way a folder is.p

I also do not know how to make my classes communicate in the best way. I tried creating a reference to my second class in my first class and viceversa but without the array or the object reference in place I cant test those links.

Negative 9273 pI am trying to create an application that can open a .csv file, add some user inputted text to the end of particular lines, then save and close that file. Ive seen many many solutions that use ReadAllLines and WriteAllLines to achieve this but for certain reasons I am stuck using VS2008 and .NET 3.5 which apparently dont have those. I was wondering if anyone knows of an equivalent method to achieve these in 3.5. If I could create an array holding each line of text in the file, I could perhaps be able to access particular lines using their index in the array, add the text I want to them, then save the file. Sadly, I am not sure how to do this or if it is even possible. Im still fairly new to C so this might be complete gibberish but I hope it isnt If anyone has any suggestions for how I could possibly go about this, it would be much appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 9273 pSo here is the scenario. I have a user defined regular expression stored in variable codemyregexcode. I should have no other knowledge than it having a named group called codeidcode. For example, one valid regex could bep  precodemyregex  ABCltidgt...ABC codepre  pIm trying to do this match this regex against a string, and substitute the group codeidcode with a fixed string code123code. For examplep  precodemyfuncmyregex, ABC789ABCQQQQ gt ABC123ABCQQQQ codepre  pNow I know that this could be done if I got to define the regex myself, for example, I could define codemyregexcode as codeABC...ABCcode, and just usep  precodemymatchdata  myregex.matchABC789ABCQQQQ result  mymatchdata.captures[0]  123  mymatchdata.captures[2] codepre  pHowever, aside from the fact that Im not the one who gets to define it, this solution is ugly and not generalizable. What if instead of one codeidcode, I have codeid1code, codeid2code and codeid3code, with arbitrary orderp  pI was looking for something as elegant as a string template for regex, for example, imaginep  precoderesult  myregex.matchABC789ABCQQQQ  id 123 codepre  pIs there any way to achieve this in a similar fashionp

Negative 9273 pim new for these technology can somebody help me to know about some doubt. br Q1. What is the Size of CoAP packet.. br i know here 4 byte fix header, but what is the maximum size limit including header, option and payload. br br Q2. Is there any concept for Keep Alive like MQTT.. br it works on UDP for how much time it keeps open the connection is there any default time or it keeps open every time when we send packet.br br Q3. Can we use CoAP with TCP. br main problem with it CoAP is it work on UDP is there any concept like MQTT QoS. let say a sensor publish some data in every one second if subscriber goes offline is there any surety in CoAP that subscriber will get all the data when it come online.br br Q4. What is the duration of connection..br CoAP support publishsubscribe architecture may be it needs connection open all the time, is it possible with CoAP whether it is based on UDP.br br Q5. How it discover the resources..br i have one gateway n 5 sensor, how these sensor will connect to the gateway. Is gateway will find these sensor.. or Is sensor will find the gateway.. br br Q5. How sensor register with gateway.. brbr br Please help me, i really need answer.. m all new for these kind of things and suggest me something for implementation point of view.br br br Thanks.. p

I set up the following code in my code.emacscode filep  pre     when  emacsmajorversion 24       require package       setq packageenableatstartup nil       setq packagearchives        packageinitialize       addtolist packagearchives                    melpa . httpmelpa.milkbox.netpackages t       addtolist packagearchives                    gnu . httpelpa.gnu.orgpackages         addtolist packagearchives                    marmalade . httpsmarmaladerepo.orgpackages       addtolist packagearchives                    org . httporgmode.orgelpa t       addtolist packagearchives                    tromey . httptromey.comelpa t        pre  pBy default, without this code, the variable packagearchives isnt defined. After running this code, it is, and contains the right values, but doesnt seem to have any effect. I verified that this variable is not customized anywhere.p  pThe problem is that I dont get to see any packages from the various archives I added Only from tromey. Obviously Im doing something wrong, but this code is supposed to work from emacs version 24 and higher. p  pCan someone suggest how to set up my repositories properlyp
Negative 9273 pIve read a few answers, and tried a bit of different code from them, but havent been able to solve this.
